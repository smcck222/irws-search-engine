FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: Lufthansa shares to be offered

New German and foreign investors are to be offered the opportunity to buy
shares in Lufthansa, the German national airline, at DM182 (Dollars 118), a
small discount to the last traded price.
About 3.9m shares are being offered to private investors outside the US as
part of the privatisation of Lufthansa, with the government reducing its
stake from 51.4 per cent to about 41 per cent. Dresdner Bank is
co-ordinating a syndicate of international banks involved in the issue.
Bankers hope the lessons learned in the sale could help them in the sale of
Deutsche Telekom, one of Europe's biggest privatisations.
A decision on which foreign banks will play leading roles in the
privatisation, the first tranche of which is expected to raise at least
DM10bn, is expected to emerge after discussions in Bonn this week.
About 20 foreign banks have put in submissions and their presentations have
been studied by Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank, the Bonn government and
Deutsche Telekom.
That this is taking place before a global co-ordinator has been appointed
for the issue, expected in 1996, has been criticised by some German banks.
Both Deutsche and Dresdner are keen to win the mandate. There is speculation
that Bonn might appoint both as joint global co-ordinators to avoid any
criticism from Deutsche Bank's own interests in the German
telecommunications industry.
It is understood that among the banks which have sent submissions to Bonn
for the Telekom issue are: Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs,
Lehman Brothers, Salomon Brothers, SG Warburg, Kleinwort Benson, Barclays de
Zoete Wedd, National Westminster, NM Rothschild, Robert Fleming, the three
main Swiss banks and several French banks, including Banque Paribas, Societe
Generale and Banque Nationale de Paris.

<TEXT>
US anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws came under attack at the
opening of a two-day hearing by the US International Trade Committee into
the broad effects of the legislation. The hearing is part of a two-year ITC
investigation ordered by Mrs Carla Hills, the former US trade
representative, before she left office last year.
The lead witness, Congressman Jim Kolbe, an Arizona Republican, said US
trade policies were failing to recognise 'the challenges of global and
economic integration and capitalise on economic opportunities'.
Mr Peter Watson, chairman of the ITC, welcomed the study which he said would
include an economy-wide empirical analysis of the economic impact of
unfairly traded imports on selected domestic industries and consumers, as
well as the specific industries, which seek relief from imports under the
trade laws. The study will also estimate the effects 'on both upstream and
downstream industries of unfair trade imports as well as the reverse effects
associated with the remedy', he said.

<TEXT>
The US has imposed an anti-dumping tariff on Ecuadorian and Colombian roses.
The US Commerce Department has determined that US growers had suffered
injury by Ecuadorian and Colombian producers and penalised them with 50 per
cent and 33 per cent tariffs respectively.
Ecuadorian flower growers argue that the US Commerce Department incorrectly
applied its standards. Because no comparable domestic market exists for the
type of roses they export, three of the four companies investigated by the
US were judged by a third country comparison.
The new tariff comes only a year after the Andean Trade Preference Act
(ATPA) eliminated import tariffs on flowers from the Andean region.
The tariff is a blow to efforts to promote alternative crops intended to
replace the cultivation of coca. Ecuador exported approximately Dollars 30m
worth of flowers last year and expected sales of Dollars 45m this year, of
which approximately 70 per cent are roses. Colombia's total flower exports
equalled Dollars 381m in 1993.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - World's Economies -
Developing Countries (65): Hitches in reform policy - South Korea: a study
in contrasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The South Korean economy is a study in contrasts as the East Asian nation
prepares to join the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
in 1996.
The economy has returned to robust health after two years of the slowest
growth in more than a decade.
A boom in exports, aided by a weak Korean currency, has sparked a large
expansion of industrial facilities. GNP is expected to rise by 8.3 per cent
in 1994.
But there are growing worries in Seoul that the economic upsurge may only
prove to be temporary since it is largely based on the strong Japanese yen
undercutting the competitiveness of Korea's chief industrial rival in Asia.
There are doubts whether Korea can perform as well once the yen weakens. A
warning about the future of the Korean economy was recently given by a joint
report from the Swiss-based International Institute for Management
Development (IMD) and the World Economic Forum, which concluded that Korea
has slipped from third to seventh place among developing nations in global
competitiveness since 1991.
The independent study gave Korea poor marks for trade protectionism, the
internationalisation of its financial system, and strong government
interference in the economy.
Korea has already outlined an ambitious programme of economic deregulation
and financial liberalisation to solve these ills and help gain support for
its OECD membership bid.
But the reform policy already appears to be running into trouble in its
initial stages, although the bulk of the changes are not due to be
implemented until 1996 or later.
There are several reasons for the problems that the reforms are
encountering. There is bureaucratic opposition among the economic
ministries, which fear a loss of power as a result of the changes.
The government worries that the rapid introduction of reforms would remove
restraints on the expansion of the big conglomerates, or chaebol, which
would increase their economic dominance at the expense of small and medium
businesses.
Officials, for example, are opposing the entry of Samsung and Hyundai into
the car and steel industries, respectively, in spite of promises to
deregulate the economy from state control.
A programme to privatise 47 state-owned companies has also become bogged
down because of government concerns that it will offer an opportunity for
the chaebol to expand their industrial empires.
The public is also sceptical about the benefits promised by a fall in trade
barriers and increased foreign investment. Memories of harsh Japanese
colonial rule until 1945 are still strong and the public perception is that
foreign investment represents a new threat of economic exploitation by
outside interests.
Finally, there are worries about the disruptive effects that the reforms
would impose on the economy. The free flow of capital into Korea, for
example, could increase inflationary pressure. The internationalisation of
the Korean won might cause it to appreciate, which would harm exports.
Financial liberalisation is being held back by the poor state of the
nation's banks, which have sizeable bad debts on their books because of
previous government directives that forced them to lend to favoured
industries with little regard for their creditworthiness.
An overhaul of the banking industry is necessary before the financial
reforms can proceed.
The chaebol have also built huge debt-equity ratios that could expose them
to financial problems if reforms are quickly introduced.
It is not surprising then that the government has adopted a cautious
approach on the reforms.
But critics claim that the slow pace of implementation could rob the reform
programme of whatever momentum it had when the government of President Kim
Young-sam announced the changes a year ago.
Although the proposed reform schedule is rapid by the historical standards
of Korea, it still appears leisurely compared to the market opening efforts
of other countries in Asia, including China.
The financial liberalisation measures to be introduced within the next year
are minimal.
The government, for example, has promised to raise the ceiling on foreign
ownership of stock from 10 per cent to 15 per cent by next June.
But there are doubts among foreign securities houses in Seoul whether this
target will be met because of government worries that an increase in the
ceiling could cause share prices to climb. The ministry of finance is
already intervening to keep the bourse from overheating as part of its
anti-inflation effort.
Although the bond market has recently been opened to foreigner investors,
they are limited to buying convertible bonds of small and medium-sized
companies and long-term state and public bonds.
The raising of overseas funds by Korean companies is only being gradually
eased because of fears that an excess amount of capital will flow into the
country and increase inflation.
This approach is being taken in spite of arguments that increased overseas
borrowing would improve the country's competitiveness because it would allow
industry to take advantage of lower interest rates abroad.
Cheaper overseas capital would improve the ability of companies to make
necessary investments to counter a rise in wages.
Foreign investment restrictions are only being dropped in selected areas.
Foreign participation in infrastructure projects is being encouraged because
of the need to remove transport bottlenecks that are hampering economic
growth.
Reduced restrictions on foreign investment have been limited so far to
high-tech companies. 'Welcome as these measures are, they still reflect a
desire on the part of government to micro-manage the economy by targeting
specific industries and keeping the playing field uneven,' said Merrill
Lynch, the US securities firm, in a recent commentary on the Korean economy.
The climate for reforms could worsen in the coming months. The national
assembly is expected this autumn to debate approval of the Uruguay Round of
Gatt measures, which has already provoked a storm of protest in Korea
because it would force the opening of the rice market.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - World's Economies -
Developing Countries (64): Poised to benefit from thriving Asia - Australia
and New Zealand / Both countries are forecasting growth of around 4 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Australia and New Zealand, taking their cue from the US, have led the
industrialised world out of recession.
The improvement began to be apparent in late 1993. By 1994, both countries
had posted year-on-year growth rates, in terms of gross domestic product, of
around 5 per cent. Now both are forecasting that growth will be sustained at
slightly below this level - somewhere around the 4 per cent mark - for the
foreseeable future.
But, despite the countries' geographical proximity and the fact that both
implemented significant reform programmes in the 1980s - which deregulated
their economies, lowered tariff barriers, and encouraged competition in key
industries - the differences between the two countries are marked.
New Zealand has pushed down the reform road at a cracking pace, and extended
the reform programme into its welfare sector, replacing the previous
'universal' system with 'targeted' arrangements aimed at aiding only the
most needy.
It has also enshrined in law some key elements of its new economic order.
The Reserve Bank's right to pursue anti-inflationary policies independently
of political interference, is one example. The Employment Contracts Act,
which essentially did away with the centralised wage award system in favour
of individual contracts, is another.
On the one hand, this has brought international approbation. Foreign
investment in New Zealand has been strong; direct net investment inflow in
the year to end-March was more than twice the level of the previous 12
months, at NZDollars 4.7bn.
The country also moved to a small budget surplus in the year to end of June
1994, the first seen in New Zealand for 20 years and a result which
surpassed even Treasury expectations.
Even with this extra leeway, however, the ruling National government decided
to first tackle the country's lingering debt problem - at mid-year, public
debt stood at 39.6 per cent of GDP - and only then reward New Zealanders for
their past sacrifices. Tax cuts were held out as a very distant carrot,
possibly becoming available in 1996/7.
But New Zealand has paid a political price for this financial zealotry. The
reform programme was begun under a Labour government, and initially tagged
'Rogernomics' after Sir Roger Douglas, the finance minister.
In 1990, the electorate switched its allegiance to the National Party, only
to find the new government extending the reforms to the welfare system.
At the last general election, in November last year, the electorate appeared
at first to have returned a hung parliament - until a recount in marginal
seats gave National a one-seat majority. Since then, there has been one
by-election, where National scraped home again by just over 300 votes.
More fundamentally, the New Zealand electorate showed its dissatisfaction by
electing to replace the current 'first-past-the-post' electoral system,
which mirrors the British model, by a form of proportional representation
which is based loosely on the German system. This, it has been said, will
give minority parties a greater say, and lead to 'consensus' government.
Both National and Labour look likely to be losers under the new arrangements
which could come into force from mid-1995 onwards.
Australia, with a much larger economy and a very different cultural history,
has made the changes more gently. Trade barriers are set to come down over
the present decade, for example. The government has moved to encourage
workplace-based 'enterprise bargaining', but has traded a slower rate of
change for union compliance.
Its recent industrial relations reform legislation actually beefed up
workers' protections - by, for example, enshrining the right to strike in
law.
The Reserve Bank, despite some political assertions, is not seen as an
independent force, and certainly has none of the guaranteed protections and
clearly-stated objectives under which the Reserve Bank of New Zealand
operates. Some large government or state-controlled enterprises, such as
Telecom Australia (known as Telstra outside its home market), have not yet
been privatised. The issue of what, if any, further sell-offs should be
permitted is a matter of debate. A federal budget surplus is not expected
before 1997.
And Australia's federal government used the 'growth dividend' - the
financial leeway resulting from the country's faster-than-expected growth
rate over the past 12 months - to finance a major jobs programme, designed
to help tackle the issue of 'long-term' unemployment.
The result has been a much more stable political environment. The Australian
Labor Party, which began the changes, is still in office although many
observers did not favour its chances going into the 1993 election. A
backlash has been more apparent at state level, with only Queensland
remaining under Labor control.
Where the two economies go from here is an interesting question. Both stand
to benefit from the booming Asian region, in terms of export demand,
investment opportunities, and through the service sector - whether it is
catering to Japanese brides in Christchurch or Malaysian students in Perth.
Both, though, have to move up the value-added export curve, and reduce their
role as Asia's 'farm and quarry'.
Australia and New Zealand are also seen as two leading beneficiaries of the
Uruguay Round's conclusion, in the latest GATT negotiations. The benefit to
the New Zealand farm sector has been put at around NZDollars 1.5bn a year of
extra export business, once the provisions are fully implemented; in
Australia, the equivalent figure could be around ADollars 1bn-plus.
For Australia, the challenge centres on avoiding the 'boom-and-bust' cycle
seen in previous upswings. In part, this scenario has resulted because of a
tendency for the country's balance of payments to lurch out of kilter -
prompting interest rate hikes.
There are some Cassandras who see this scenario repeating itself, especially
if business investment, which has been slow to recover, surges all at once.
Imports of plant and equipment will rise, it is argued, and the current
account deficit will widen.
The optimists' counter-claim is that the restructuring of the economy means
that Australia is more competitive, and that it will maintain a much
stronger export performance.
For New Zealand, there is still the task of reducing debt. But the bigger
issue remains the political one - in particular, whether the economic
benefits of the decade of austerity have filtered down to enough voters to
ensure that some of the more controversial elements of the reform process,
such as the Employment Contracts Act, are not repealed.

Developing Countries (62): Cooling down the overheated dragon - China / Tony
Walker on difficulties in the reform programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China's economy continues its roller coaster ride with the authorities
grappling with unsustainable growth rates, inflation and the difficulties of
managing a complex transformation from a centrally-planned to a
market-oriented system.
The announcement in late August that the government was re-introducing price
controls to curb inflation and was also pumping additional funds into ailing
state enterprises indicated increasing official nervousness over the
possible social costs of its economic reforms.
Since the unveiling of a 16-point stabilisation programme in July 1993, the
government has sought to calm an overheating economy by resort to tight
money policies. These measures helped restore a semblance of order to a
chaotic economy by strengthening credit controls and bolstering central
supervision over an errant financial sector.
But the 'macroeconomic control measures' have been less successful than the
government would have hoped in combating inflation which has now been
singled out as the main threat to China's social and economic advancement.
Indeed, the authorities have announced that reducing inflationary pressures
will be the main task for the rest of the year.
Official nervousness about a link between rising prices and possible social
unrest was spurred by July urban cost-of-living figures which showed a jump
of 24.2 per cent over the same period last year. This indicated that price
rises were beginning to accelerate again after appearing to slow in recent
months.
The government has also been obliged to acknowledge that its attempts to
reform state-owned enterprises are proving more difficult than anticipated
in the light of social stresses caused by rising prices, and the dire
situation of many of these companies
According to the State Statistical Bureau some 50 per cent among 11,000
medium and large state enterprises were in the red in the first part of this
year. One of the most serious problems facing the government is that of
'triangular debt' - the inability of virtually bankrupt state enterprises to
pay each other for goods and services.
In turn, the continuing voracious demands for subsidies of faltering state
companies is threatening to undermine the government's tight money policies.
State enterprise reform continues to be a significant challenge and burden.
Inevitably, the government's announcement that it would reinstate price
controls (it announced there would be no new increases for the rest of the
year) and would also bail out failing enterprises, has raised questions
about its commitment to continued economic liberalisation.
But while western economists detect 'wavering' in the reform effort, they
believe that in the longer term China has no choice. 'The government
recognises that the reforms are essential, both to ensure balanced
sustainable growth and to provide an effective set of market-based
macroeconomic management tools,' said one.
China's outlook for this year is for continued high growth rates in excess
of the official 9 per cent real GDP target. Economists expect growth between
11-12 per cent compared with rates of more than 13 per cent in the past two
years. Real GDP increased by 12.7 per cent in the first quarter and 10.5 per
cent in the second quarter of 1994.
The inflation bogey may have taken the gloss off the government's economic
programme, but this is not to say China's economic managers are without some
notable achievements. These include currency unification, stabilisation of
the exchange rate, stronger growth in exports, a sharp improvement in
foreign exchange reserves and the introduction of complex tax reforms aimed
at improving central government revenues.
The authorities also completed the successful sale of Yn100bn (USDollars
11.7bn) in state treasury bonds to finance the budget deficit. Public demand
for the government paper was stronger than anticipated and sales targets
were achieved ahead of schedule.
Bank savings have also risen strongly following two rounds of interest rate
increases (by a cumulative 4 per cent) last year. Urban and rural savings
rose by 28 per cent in 1993 to Yn1476bn (equivalent to 47 per cent of GDP).
Government attempts to slow capital spending as part of its anti-inflation
strategy have met with mixed success. Total investment grew last year by
more than 50 per cent compared with the previous year. It fell back to 25.5
per cent in the first half of this year; but a July surge in investment in
state-owned fixed assets to 73 per cent compared with the same month last
year proved alarming.
The government had blamed a capital spending binge in 1993, much of it in
speculative real estate, for the inflationary pressures which are still
bedevilling the economy.
China's central bank has indicated that it plans to tighten credit in the
third quarter, and also to clamp down on the activities of non-bank
financial institutions such as trust companies. These institutions have been
singled out as the main culprits in unauthorised lending outside the credit
plan.
China's budgetary position continues to be difficult. China budgeted for a
Yn66.9bn deficit for 1994-95, but this almost certainly understates the
likely funding gap. While state revenues increased by 22.6 per cent in the
first half of this year compared with the same period last year, the central
government's financial position remained weak.
The finance ministry blamed below target revenue growth, pressures on
expenditure and tax evasion for a shortfall in revenues. Prospects for
improvement in the second half of the year do not appear all that promising.
In contrast, China's external situation has improved sharply. After
recording a trade deficit of USDollars 12.2bn in 1993, China may be heading
for a balanced trading account in 1994.
Exports grew by 31.2 per cent in the first half of the year compared with
import growth of 19 per cent, reversing last year's trend in which imports
grew much faster than exports.

Developing Countries (63): The tigers are still growing - East Asia / Victor
Mallet describes the region's success story
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
It is as hard to meet pessimistic economists in east Asia as it is to find
negative economic growth rates. If success is measured in gross domestic
product, developing Asian countries have been and continue to be
pre-eminently successful examples of how to manage high-speed industrial
revolutions.
According to the Asian Development Bank, per capita income in developing
Asia grew at an average rate of 4.4 per cent a year between 1970 and 1992,
compared with 1 per cent in Latin America and virtually nil in Africa. Last
year, growth in the developing Asian economies was almost 10 times as high
as in Africa and more than twice as high as in Latin America or the Middle
East.
There is no sign that growth is slowing. Cambodia is mired in a messy civil
war, but the communist-run economies of Vietnam and Laos are being
liberalised and are expanding.
Economists predict that growth in China will moderate after the double-digit
expansion of the past two years, but average GDP growth in the four
south-east Asian economies of Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore
should rise to more than 8 per cent this year from 7.8 per cent in 1993 and
6.9 per cent in 1992. Even the Philippines and Burma, Asia's laggards, are
recovering.
Behind the rosy statistics lie some extraordinarily rapid industrial and
social changes.
Retailing, for example, is being transformed in south-east Asia. Giant,
western-style shopping malls - Seacon Square, said to be the largest mall in
Asia, was opened in Bangkok in August - are starting to replace markets and
small shops.
As international communications improve and Asian countries industrialise at
an ever-increasing speed, Asians are leap-frogging whole stages of
development experienced in previous industrial revolutions. Some people use
cellular telephones before they know what it is to have a fixed telephone.
Exports of rice and tapioca are replaced by exports of microchips, allowing
western companies to exploit niche markets by exporting to Asia intermediate
industrial goods.
Asia's success has spawned a clutch of reports seeking to explain what Asia
is doing right and what other regions of the world might emulate. The
findings are not particularly startling: successful Asian countries have
encouraged foreign investment, been fiscally responsible, and kept inflation
low; their citizens save much of their income and do not have too many
children.
Predicting which factors might limit Asian growth in the future is more
problematic.
Several Asian countries lack the transport and communications infrastructure
required to support their increasingly modern industrial economies, but such
difficulties will probably be overcome in time with the help of money from
foreign investors and fast-growing local capital markets; even Thailand,
which has been notoriously lax in developing its infrastructure, is building
new roads and is now installing millions of new telephone lines, although
work on a mass transit system for congested Bangkok has yet to begin.
The environmental damage caused by population growth and uncontrolled
pollution and commercial exploitation could be another factor limiting Asian
growth, especially since several of the region's economies still depend
heavily on exports of natural products such as timber and fish.
Environmentalists say the recent growth rates of high-performing Asian
economies would be several percentage points lower if the benefits from
asset-stripping of environmental resources were excluded from the figures.
Another problem is the shortage of skilled labour that is already increasing
costs in some fast-growing Asian countries, and the lack of home-grown
technical skills.
And although intra-Asian trade and investment are increasing, the worsening
mood of Asia's international trading partners in the US and Europe could yet
turn out to be the most important determinant of Asian growth rates.
As the World Bank noted in a report* published in July, east Asia's exports
have risen more than thirtyfold in the past quarter of a century to about
Dollars 850bn, increasing the east Asian share of all world exports to 21
per cent from seven per cent.
The result of this - industrialised countries' imports from east Asia have
been rising by 15 to 20 per cent a year without their receiving greatly
improved access to Asian markets in return - is a series of probably
unsustainable Asian trade surpluses and rising trade tension between the US
on the one hand and China and Japan on the other.
The World Bank recommends that Asian exporters, for their own good, should
therefore accelerate the liberalisation of their trade regimes. Import
tariffs, for example, should be halved, bearing in mind that countries such
as China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam have sometimes
been protecting manufacturing with effective rates of more than 40 per cent.
Much of the industry protected for nationalistic reasons is not domestic. In
Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand, the ADB says, foreign companies
account for more than half of manufactured exports.
'Import protection is no longer justified by the old infant-industry
arguments,' the World Bank report says. 'Many of the protected industries
are no longer infants, and much of the protection is costly.'
A number of Asian governments have already embarked on a new round of
tariff-cutting and liberalising of foreign investment laws. Economists in
Asia, for whom optimism has become a way of life, are betting that the
region's dragons and tigers will once again adapt successfully to the
international climate and that GDP will continue to grow both in absolute
and in per capita terms.

Developing Countries (59): Still battling with self-doubt - Latin America /
New reforms may be on the way
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The implementation at the beginning of this year of the North American Free
Trade Agreement was expected to mark a watershed for Latin American
economies.
Yet 1994 has been marked more by reminders of the region's continuing
political and economic difficulties than by indications of how far Latin
America has moved in the past five years.
The advances are nonetheless important. There has been a sharp decline in
inflation in most countries. While generally economic growth has not been as
rapid as governments had hoped, it has usually been positive enough to
secure some modest rises in real incomes after the declines of the 1980s.
Tariff and other barriers to foreign trade have universally been lowered. At
the same time a plethora of free trade agreements and customs unions is
spreading over the region, though this is a development which has its
potential dangers as well as advantages.
Nonetheless, as a result of more open economies, restructuring, aimed at
increasing economic efficiency, has been promoted. This restructuring,
involving the closing of old industrial capacity, is still going on, and has
slowed growth in some countries, such as Mexico. It has also generated
unemployment, ensuring continued unpopularity for the reform process.
The opening of regional economies has also created conditions for a widening
of trade and current account deficits. Until February this year, these were
being readily financed by inflows from the international capital markets.
Following that month's rise in US interest rates, net flows of financing
appear to have continued to the region, but investors have been more
selective about where they place their money.
This increasing selectivity among investors also reflects an increasingly
diverse economic performance by Latin American economies as they emerge from
the decade of the debt crisis. These divergent economic and political
factors confronting investors include:
Mexico: The year began with the advent of Nafta - and a peasant uprising in
the southern state of Chiapas. The assassination in March of Luis Donaldo
Colosio, the presidential candidate of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI), led to further investor reassessment of political
risk in Mexico.
Fears were calmed somewhat by the election of Ernesto Zedillo, the PRI's
replacement candidate, in August. Uncertainties remain about a current
account deficit this year widely expected to exceed Dollars 25bn.
Brazil: Renewed enthusiasm among investors about Brazil has followed the
early success of a credible anti-inflation plan and the declining fortunes
of the left-wing candidate in presidential elections due in two rounds in
October and November.
Whoever wins the election, significant reform is still required of the 1988
constitution to bring public finances, and therefore inflation, under more
permanent control. Given the country's political system, this may be
difficult.
Argentina: This year is expected to be good again for growth - though it is
likely to be slower than last year's 6 per cent - and inflation is widely
expected to drop below 4 per cent for the year. There remain worries about
overvaluation of the exchange rate, fixed against the dollar, as the current
account deficit widens.
Still, despite the more difficult international market conditions, financing
has been available - including a voluntary syndicated loan made available by
banks to the government for the first time since the debt crisis. President
Carlos Menem faces elections next April, having secured a constitutional
change to give him the right to stand again for office.
Venezuela: A banking crisis and a response from the new government of
President Rafael Caldera that is widely viewed to have been inept have led
to Venezuela sliding off the screen for most international investors this
year. The recession will continue for a second successive year, and with the
economy shrinking by more than last year's 1.0 per cent. Inflation is
rising.
Investors are enthusiastic about Peru, in the middle of a big privatisation
programme and where growth could top 10 per cent this year. An election next
year will see President Alberto Fujimori challenged.
Bolivia is embarking on an ambitious plan to take its state sector out of
the hands of the government. Its first flotation is due in November. Chile
has a new administration, mostly stressing continuity with the
market-oriented policies of its predecessor.
Colombia's new president Ernesto Samper has promised a softening of some of
the previous administration's policies, particularly where they affect
exporters, but also is pledging continuity overall.
In general, however, while the importance of the market is still being
widely stressed, many governments are now looking towards a new series of
reforms. This may involve the development of infrastructure - often with the
co-operation of private and public sector finance - which in many countries
is already acting as a severe bottleneck to growth.
Ironically, after years in which the role of government has been reduced in
Latin America, improvements in government effectiveness are now viewed as
vital to the reform process.
Governments need to improve their delivery of services, such as education
and health, and to build institutions - in particular the judiciary - needed
for the proper and efficient functioning of market-based democracies.
They also need to ensure that social pressures - and the widening gap
between rich and poor - do not derail the progress which has already made
towards greater economic self-sufficiency.

Developing Countries (60): Top man aims to keep his word - Profile / Ernesto
Zedillo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ernesto Zedillo, victorious candidate in Mexico's presidential election,
takes office in December with a lot to live up to. Over the next six years,
he has pledged to boost the country's lacklustre economic growth, provide
around 1m new jobs a year, improve the country's highly unequal distribution
of wealth - while maintaining low inflation and keeping public finances in
order.
A former central banker and budget minister, with an economics doctorate
from Yale University, Mr Zedillo is more aware than most of the difficulties
in keeping his word. Despite nearly a decade of economic reform, Mexico's
economy is still suffering from a rapid trade opening and the government's
tough anti-inflation policies, with many businesses struggling to compete
internationally or survive in the domestic market.
Mr Zedillo, though, will have much in his favour. The economy is much
stronger than when President Carlos Salinas came to power six years ago.
Inflation is expected this year to fall to between 6-7 per cent. The
government's budget was in surplus last year, and is expected to be roughly
in balance this year. The huge foreign debt that dominated economic policy
throughout the 1980s has been cut: Mexico's public net debt to GDP ratio is
now far lower than the average in the industrialised world.
Perhaps most important, the economic restructuring that caused so much pain
is finally beginning to bear fruit. Productivity in the manufacturing sector
is rising by about 10 per cent a year, according to government figures.
Foreign investment, drawn by the North American Free Trade Agreement, is
increasing rapidly. All this is contributing to a strong increase in
manufacturing exports, which in the first half of this year jumped by 20.9
per cent, and partly explains the modest recovery in economic growth of 2.2
per cent over the same period.
Mr Zedillo's first task will be to establish macroeconomic policy - which he
may do in conjunction with the administration if the so-called 'pacto' (the
forum in which economic policy is made) is renewed. Mr Zedillo will have to
choose between pushing for faster short-term growth (by loosening fiscal
policy and permitting a more competitive exchange rate) or maintaining the
fight against inflation (by leaving exchange rate policy unchanged, and
keeping the budget in balance.)
The Central Bank and Pedro Aspe, the finance minister, are widely believed
to be among those advocating continuation of the fight against inflation,
while Guillermo Ortiz, the influential deputy finance minister, is said to
support policies more conducive to growth. Mr Zedillo's own position is
unknown, but his campaign promises indicate that he is closer to Mr Ortiz.
However, as a former central banker and orthodox budget minister, few
believe that Mr Zedillo will want inflation to rise above present rates.
The betting is that Mr Zedillo will seek some kind of middle ground, perhaps
running a small budget deficit, raising the floor at which the peso can
trade against the dollar from 3.056 to the present informal intervention
limit of 3.25, and increasing moderately the maximum slide against the
dollar from the current 40 centavos a day (about 5 per cent a year). With
Mexico expected to run a current account deficit of between 6-7 per cent of
GDP this year, Mr Zedillo may find it hard to loosen fiscal policy without
permitting more flexibility in exchange rate policy.
The impact of the 'pacto' on growth will depend in part on how domestic
interest rates respond - influenced not just by exchange rate and fiscal
policy, but by the domestic political situation and the international
environment. The continuation of high real interest rates would likely slow
credit growth, and restrain private investment.
Once macroeconomic policy is established, Mr Zedillo is expected to move to
boost competitiveness of the economy, essential if Mexico is to thrive under
Nafta. To this end, he has pledged to spend heavily on improving
infrastructure, by increasing government spending on public investment by 25
per cent, and setting up a special state fund for private infrastructure
projects. Poor infrastructure was cited in a World Bank report as one of the
five most serious constraints on private-sector development.
The new administration has promised to encourage greater private financing
of infrastructure, especially in railways, ports, and electricity, building
on existing investment in telecommunications, water supply and roads.
Investors will watch carefully for the choice of minister of communications
and transport, who is sure to spearhead the drive to encourage private
investment in sectors once dominated by the state.
Elsewhere, Mr Zedillo is likely to favour further deregulation of the
economy, especially at the state and municipal level, give tax breaks and
subsidised credit to small and medium-sized businesses, and encourage
development of more sophisticated financial markets, in particular in the
area of mortgages and derivates.
Mr Zedillo says he will mix his pro-market reforms with increased investment
in education, training, and anti-poverty programmes to help those not
benefiting from higher economic growth and to distribute wealth more evenly.
But with already sharp income disparities having widened under the
presidency of Carlos Salinas, who pursued much the same policies, many are
sceptical that Mr Zedillo's programme will succeed in significantly reducing
the gap between Mexico's rich and poor.

Developing Countries (61): Liberal policies bear fruit - India
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The economic liberalisation which PV Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime
minister, launched three years ago is beginning to bear fruit. But without
further reforms there is a danger that progress towards economic
modernisation will remain slow.
Together with his energetic finance minister, Manmohan Singh, Mr Narasimha
Rao has dismantled much of the licence raj - the panoply of government
controls imposed upon the Indian economy in the years after independence.
They have cut barriers to foreign trade and investment, made the rupee
convertible on the current account and started overhauling the public
finances.
Much of the old structure has survived this assault, notably the pervasive
power of the bureaucracy and the baleful influence of inefficient
state-owned enterprises. The ruling Congress (I) launched reform not out of
intellectual conviction but of economic necessity - the old policies had
virtually bankrupted the country. With the 1991 economic crisis becoming a
distant memory, there is growing complacency about further reform.
However, there is little doubt that the changes Mr Narasimha Rao has already
made have opened a window of opportunity for private enterprise, including
foreign business, in India. That window may widen or narrow from time to
time but it is unlikely to slam shut.
Mr Narasimha Rao is fortunate that his rule has coincided with good
harvests. On average, the farmers, who together with their families account
for about 70 per cent of the population, are prospering, though the average
conceals great extremes of wealth and poverty. At least 200m Indians still
do not have enough to eat. But even in quite remote villages, most of the
rest are beginning to enter the consumer economy.
The key test of the economic reforms is whether they permit Indians to seize
opportunities to build on the bedrock of solid gains in agriculture. The
evidence is mixed. The first two years of reform brought tremendous
upheavals in production, as the government cut spending to reduce its
borrowings, so factories supplying the state saw their sales plummet.
The fiscal deficit plunged from 8.4 per cent of GDP in the year to March
1991 to 5.2 per cent two years later. But economic growth also fell from 4.7
per cent in 1990-91 to just 0.6 per cent the following year. It has since
recovered to 4.3 per cent in 1992-93 and 3.8 per cent in 1993-94. But these
figures compare poorly with the pre-reform 1980s when growth averaged 5.5
per cent.
Mr Manmohan Singh has tried to boost industry by cutting interest rates and
by relaxing curbs on public borrowing. The fiscal deficit grew last
financial year to 7.3 per cent of GDP and could reach a similar level this
year. With the help of this stimulus, industry is recovering sharply this
year, particularly in consumer goods. Industrial production jumped 8 per
cent in April year on year, the latest period for which figures are
available - the highest increase since 1991.
From the beginning of the reforms, the government singled out exports as a
potential engine of economic growth, favouring exporters with incentives,
including a sharp devaluation of the rupee. But in recent months, the annual
rate of growth in exports has fallen sharply from 20 per cent in 1993-4 to
8.3 per cent in the first four months of the new financial year.
The combination of reform and export growth has persuaded some foreign
investors to jump at the chance of investing in India. Since mid-1991, India
has approved foreign direct investments totalling Dollars 5bn, including
more than USDollars 3bn in the year to March. Much of it is concentrated in
power, a top government priority. The amount actually flowing into India is
also growing - from Dollars 148m in 1991-92 to an estimated Dollars 600m in
1993-94.
Foreign financial investment has mushroomed, since India in late 1992 opened
its stock market to foreign institutions and eased rules for Indian
companies to issue paper overseas. Investment from these sources has soared
from virtually nothing three years ago to an estimated USDollars 4bn in
1993-94. The growth has been so fast that it has clogged the Bombay stock
exchange's settlement machinery.
Unfortunately, for all the progress made in the past three years, there are
signs the government is not tackling obstacles on the road to modernity with
sufficient vigour.
First, the easing of curbs on government spending has fuelled inflation.
Wholesale prices are rising at an annual rate of 9 per cent, compared with
under 7 per cent a year ago. With state elections due later this year and
next, and a general election by 1996, the government will be reluctant to
cut public spending again. But if inflation is not controlled export
competitiveness will suffer, and so will popular support for the reforms.
Poor infrastructure is an even greater hurdle. While India is making
progress in trying to attract private investment into power projects, it
will take time for new schemes to alleviate overall shortages. The
inadequacy of telecommunications is equally acute, with investment delayed
by a combination of legal disputes over contracts for mobile telephone
networks and political argument about privatisation policy.
The government has made considerable progress in liberalising the capital
markets, including Indian companies' access to the Euromarkets. However, it
is reluctant to relax state control of the banking industry. The state-owned
banks, which dominate the market, are being allowed to raise private equity,
but the government will retain a majority stake. This will stifle
competition and delay the provision of modern banking services.
The inefficiency of publicly-owned services and industries remains a drag on
the economy, accounting for nearly half the nation's capital but producing
only about 27 per cent of its output. The government has sold stakes in
leading state-owned enterprises, including banks, steel operations and
electronics manufacturers. But ministers have opposed selling more than 49
per cent of a unit for fear of losing control.
The government is also reluctant to liberalise India's restrictive labour
laws, which seriously limit employers' rights to make surplus workers
redundant. While companies can find ways around the law - through voluntary
schemes and redeployment - large-scale dismissals are virtually impossible.
Finally, India's progress could be held back by the low educational
standards of much of its population. Only 52 per cent of Indians can read,
compared with about 75 per cent of Chinese. No country, except the oil-rich
middle eastern states, has modernised its economy with such high levels of
illiteracy.
India has the resources to tackle these difficulties. It is not short of
skilled administrators, teachers or engineers. What seems to be lacking is a
sense of urgency.

Developing Countries (56): Not growing, but recovering - Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS

<TEXT>
After a dismal decade of stagnation and decline, sub-Saharan Africa can, at
last, see a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel. This is the result of
firmer commodity prices, faster world trade growth, accelerating economic
reforms in many countries, and the remarkably smooth political transition in
South Africa.
The IMF forecasts growth of 3.4 per cent this year and 4.5 per cent in 1995
 -well above the average 2.2 per cent over the past decade. However, this
marginally brighter prospect should be seen in perspective. Africa is not
growing, but recovering. In the past 10 years, per capita incomes fell 0.8
per cent a year. Nor is the recovery solidly based. Events in Sudan, Somalia
and Rwanda, ongoing hostilities in Angola and the uneasy mood in Mozambique
ahead of the October elections underscore its fragility. Tensions in Nigeria
and Zaire could any day spill over into serious regional economic
disruption.
A recent research paper by World Bank economists William Easterly and Ross
Levine* explains the region's poor performance 'statistically' in terms of
poor education, political instability, weak infrastructure and financial
systems, overvalued exchange rates, ethnic diversity and 'troubles with
neighbours'.
This last effect is explained in terms of critical mass; the writers argue
that if African neighbours act together to reform their economic policies,
as indeed is happening increasingly now, there will be positive spillover
and demonstration effects across national borders. This leads them to
conclude, optimistically, that Africa's poor growth performance is 'very
much reversible', even if some adverse factors, such as poor education and
infrastructural decay, will have long-lasting effects.
Factor into their analysis, a rejuvenated South African economy, and the
potential for positive cross-border spillovers is considerable. At current
exchange rates, following the 50 per cent devaluation of the CFA Franc in
January, South Africa's GDP of Dollars 120bn falls not very short of that of
the rest of sub-Saharan Africa - Dollars 135bn to Dollars 140bn. South
Africa's economy, too, has stagnated for the past dozen years, and its
return to growth of 4 per cent annually, which is not unrealistic, would be
a significant boost for the regional economy, especially for southern
Africa.
There are two distinct schools of thought on this. On one side, it is argued
that the South Africans will be so preoccupied with their own internal
problems - especially the successful implementation of their social
advancement programme, the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP),
that they will pay little attention to the rest of the region in the
immediate future.
The alternative viewpoint holds that South Africa is on course to become the
locomotive for much of sub-Saharan Africa, partly as a growing market for
African primary products and some low-price manufactures, but more
importantly as an exporter of capital, skills and services. It's no
coincidence that South African firms are in the forefront of the
privatisation of hotels and cement plants in Mozambique, the planned
sell-off of Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, involved in tourism in East
Africa, manufacturing and mining in Botswana and Zimbabwe and the
development of the region's financial infrastructure.
While western banks are pulling in their horns in Africa, Stanbic, South
Africa's leading banking group, has expanded by taking over the African
operations of ANZ Grindlays. Fledgling stock exchanges being set up all over
the continent will benefit from South African advice and expertise. There is
enormous, largely untapped potential for integrated tourism programmes
linking destinations in Kenya, Malawi, Mauritius, Botswana and Zimbabwe with
South Africa.
South Africa's Escom is becoming the hub of a regional energy grid, drawing
on Pretoria's excess capacity but also electricity imports from Mozambique's
Cahora Bassa, and South African investors may develop the Pande gas deposit
in Mozambique.
The 1992 drought was a reminder of just how dependent southern Africa had
become on South Africa's transport system, in spite of ambitious
donor-funded programmes which were intended to reduce that dependence. The
bulk of the maize and wheat needed came in through South Africa.
The trade numbers tell the same largely lopsided story. In 1992, South
Africa had an estimated trade surplus of R13.8bn (Dollars 4.8bn) with the
rest of Africa. Most of this was with its Southern African Customs Union
(SACU) partners - Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland and Namibia - which between
them accounted for R9bn. But it also had sizeable trade surpluses with
Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, Mauritius and Mozambique.
While such a one-sided trade pattern - African exports to South Africa were
worth R2.6bn compared with imports of R16.4bn - is a cause of concern to
both sides, it is likely to get worse rather than better. African countries
are finding South African products to be cheaper (in some cases), often more
appropriate, and frequently more readily available with shorter lead times.
The Dollars 225m Hartley Platinum development in Zimbabwe announced last
month will source much of its capital equipment from South Africa.
At the same time, there is little appetite in South Africa itself for the
rest of the region's goods, which are largely poor quality, and cannot
compete with imports from Asia.
The signs are that the existing south-north trade and payments gap will
widen, despite increased purchases of African primary goods - Kenyan coffee,
Malawian tea, Botswana soda ash, Angolan oil, Zimbabwean tobacco and Zambian
copper - by South African firms and increased tourist spending by
holidaymakers from the south.
Southern Africa, in particular, has much to gain from closer co-operation in
transport, energy, tourism and even education, but hopes of a regional free
trade area and of broadening the existing rand monetary area to include
other countries, are almost certainly premature. The hearts are willing, the
rhetoric is there in spades, but harsh economic reality speaks otherwise. At
the end of the day, few African leaders are prepared to surrender an ounce
of what little of economic autonomy they have managed to salvage from
bilateral and multilateral donors, and multinational corporations.
Whether South Africa's re-emergence will be the catalyst providing the
neighbourly spillover for the rest of the region is highly problematic.
President Mandela and his largely untried team have to prove that they can
break the African mould, delivering the east Asian cocktail of rapid growth
with improved equity, that has eluded the often-feeble efforts of the rest
of the continent. History, and hard economic numbers are against them, but
at the tail-end of a decade of wasted aid and often-ineffectual policy
reform in sub-Saharan Africa, the new South Africa is the region's best bet.

For most of the past decade, South African planners have been warning that
without drastic policy changes in the political and economic arenas, the
domestic economy was doomed to continue on a downward spiral of high
inflation, low growth and stagnant employment.
Testifying to the accuracy of such predictions, South Africa's economic
record over the past 10 years has been dismal, averaging growth of less than
1 per cent a year. At the same time, triggered by the combination of
sustained political unrest, the loss of international confidence, and gross
economic mismanagement by the government, inflation and government spending
soared while investment, domestic savings and overall business confidence
plunged.
Now that the political side of the equation has finally been resolved,
however, there is widespread optimism in the country that the economic
challenges can be tackled with equal success.
And with political change fortuitously coinciding with an upturn in the
global business cycle, there is a widespread belief that South Africa can
become an economic engine capable not only of pulling millions of its own
citizens out of the mire of poverty, but acting as a catalyst for renewed
growth in the region as well.
Unfortunately, however, the situation is not that simple. The distorted
policies of the apartheid era have left a deep-seated and destructive
economic legacy that will take years to resolve. The crucial problem remains
government spending, which accounted for 21 per cent of GDP over the first
half of 1994 - a figure double the norm in most developing Asian economies.
This extraordinarily high level of government involvement in the economy
causes other problems, too. Funding the budget deficit, expected to be 6.6
per cent of GDP, diverts money from new fixed investment while continued
spending by government intensifies inflationary pressures. The high level of
government borrowing also means that gross domestic saving in the economy,
essential to help fund new development, is at only 16 per cent of GDP.
Compounding the problem is the fact that the economy remains overwhelmingly
dependent on commodity exports, which account for some 71 per cent of
foreign exchange earnings. Although the government has been trying for some
years to switch the focus to manufactured goods, it remains hampered by the
fact that South Africa's economy is still highly protected, and many of its
enterprises uncompetitive by global standards.
In addition, the maintenance of a relatively expensive workforce with a low
skills base acts as a further obstacle to development. In an international
competiveness survey released by the World Economic Forum this month South
Africa ranked 35th out of 41 countries and came last in the 'people'
category, assessing the educational and training levels of the general
populace.
Despite all this, however, the underlying fact remains that the economic
outlook for South Africa is better than it has been for decades. Growth this
year is expected to be around 2.5 per cent, below the more optimistic
forecasts made at the beginning of the year, but still up on 1993's 1.1 per
cent, which itself followed four years of painful recession. Next year the
figure is expected to reach between 3.5-4 per cent.
The consensus among most economists is that provided the government sticks
to conservative fiscal and monetary policies, South Africa is capable of
continuing to generate domestic growth of around 3.5 per cent for the next
five years. But to achieve more than that, a significant inflow of foreign
investment, bringing with it exposure to new international skills and
technology denied to the country during its years of isolation, is
desperately needed.
So far, the first condition seems to be met. Despite the immense political
pressures on the ruling African National Congress to provide the populace
with tangible benefits following the demise of apartheid, it has
successfully resisted the temptation to undertake high spending, populist
policies that would further destroy the economy's fragile base.
Indeed, in its public statements to date, including the June budget, the
government has been a model of fiscal probity, stressing its commitment to
reducing the budget deficit and promising to fund its centrepiece
reconstruction and development programme through savings rather than new
borrowing. And while inflation may be rising, its current level of 8.2 per
cent is still well down on the double digit rates that characterised the
1980s.
In addition, trade and industry minister Trevor Manuel has shown an
encouraging willingess to take on entrenched business lobbies and has
already started to dismantle tariffs in sectors such as the motor and
textiles industry to force South African manufacturers to become more
competitive.
Despite its good track record, however, the markets remain sceptical of the
government's ability to successfully rein in spending - a fact signalled in
the recent rise of bond yields to more than 17 per cent, representing a real
rate of return of more than 9 per cent. And while industrial restructuring
is an essential step if South Africa is to successfully start pursuing an
export-led growth strategy, in the short term it is likely to depress rather
than enhance growth prospects.
However, most analysts agree that the key to whether the South African
economy can finally step on to the high road of renewed growth is whether it
can successfully attract renewed inflows of foreign capital.
Although the country has seen net capital outflows of around R50bn between
1985 and the first half of 1994, since June the situation appears to have
stabilised. But it has not yet reversed. People have stopped taking money
out of South Africa, but few people are yet willing to start putting new
investments into the country. Meanwhile, the country's foreign reserves
remain seriously depleted and are currently able to cover only five weeks of
imports.
With total foreign currency debt at only Dollars 16.7bn and interest
payments accounting for just 7 per cent of exports in 1993, one possible
means of correcting this is renewed borrowing. However, the far more
desirable route is new foreign investment. But while a large number of
foreign companies have set up offices or franchise operations in South
Africa over the past 18 months, few have yet made any investments of any
significance.
As a result, over the next few years South Africa is likely to follow a path
of only moderate growth, representing a significant improvement over the
recent past but still well short of the high levels the ANC needs to satisfy
the needs of its black constituents.

Developing Countries (58): New realism among leaders - Middle East
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Progress towards a lasting settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the
price of oil are the two most obvious factors likely to influence the
performance of Middle East economies in the year ahead. However, neither is
susceptible to accurate forecasting, and both can be severely affected by
the invariably unpleasant political shocks for which the Middle East has
become rightly notorious.
The chain of events set in motion by first, the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq
in August 1990, and second, by the outline peace accord signed by Israel and
the Palestine Liberation Organisation in September 1993, is still being
played out. The Gulf war and the putative Arab-Israeli peace agreement has
prompted some western leaders and their advisers to conclude that the
implications of the Soviet Union's departure from the Middle East political
equation has finally been understood and has provoked a new realism among
leaders in the region.
This argument suggests that the overwhelming superiority of US and Israeli
military forces is obvious even to the most militant. President Saddam
Hussein of Iraq has been cowed, and the radical clerics in Iran have been
contained. Col Muammer Gadaffi of Libya is a shadow of his former
provocative self, while Yassir Arafat, chairman of the PLO, is now a welcome
guest at the White House, and may be followed, perhaps before too long, by
President Hafez al-Assad of Syria.
There is a strong body of opinion within the US State Department that
believes the peace process is now irreversible, whatever the short-term
difficulties. 'The fundamentals for a lasting peace are almost all in place,
in large part because the key players have run out of alternatives,' said a
senior official recently. 'Negotiations, especially between Israel and Syria
will be very hard, but both sides are now fully committed to the process.'
Less cheerfully, there also appears to be a broad measure of agreement that
the economic dividends flowing from the peace process will be slow to
emerge. International investors will initially be cautious, while more
fruitful regional co-operation will almost certainly have to await the
actual signing of peace treaties. Tourism could be an early beneficiary, as
could related transport projects involving shared airports and ports on the
Israel-Jordanian border. But fear of Israeli economic domination will make
Arab governments hesitant about larger-scale projects, and there is little
political enthusiasm for lifting the primary boycott against Israel despite
its slow erosion. Within the Palestinian territories from which Israel has
already withdrawn, progress in utilising the Dollars 2.4bn aid committed for
the next five years is proving painfully slow.
The emergence of stronger inflationary pressures in Israel has prompted
successive interest rate rises this year which has led to a scaling down of
growth forecasts. But Israel's longer-term prospects of more sustained
export-led growth can only have been enhanced by the new markets which have
opened up as a consequence of the peace process. In the medium term,
however, there seems little prospect of reducing the heavy arms spending
burden on the national budget, with Israel determined to enhance the
technological advantage it enjoys over its Arab neighbours.
The same military expenditure pattern is being repeated in the Gulf where
the fears and suspicions created by the eight-year Iraq-Iran conflict and
the subsequent Gulf war have only partially subsided. Despite a worsening
budget deficit, which this year prompted an attempt to cut official spending
by 20 per cent, Saudi Arabia continues to give precedence to strengthening
its defences.
The government has been forced to negotiate a slowdown in payments on
military aircraft purchases from the US, but the overall procurement
programme remains largely untouched.
The effects are being most sharply felt by civil contractors and other
government suppliers who complain of steadily worsening payments delays.
While this may contribute to an apparent narrowing of the budget deficit at
the end of the financial year, the warning bells sounded by the IMF in 1993
have not been silenced. The danger of the total government debt rising as a
percentage of gross domestic product from the present level of about 58 per
cent to 80 per cent by 1997 has not receded. And in the absence of a
sustained rise in the price of oil, a squeeze on commercial banks' liquidity
as a result of official borrowing could yet harm the development of the
private sector which is supposed to act as the main motor of economic
growth.
The widening fiscal gap created by static or falling government revenues,
and rising recurrent and capital expenditure, goes to the core of the
problem facing the Arab Gulf states. Slowly, governments are being forced to
accept that the all-embracing welfare state cannot be financed indefinitely.
Deeper cuts will have to be made and issues of taxation addressed. The
reluctance of governments to grasp this particular nettle indicates the
impact such reforms may have on political stability.
More immediate concerns in the Gulf are focused on Iran and Iraq, and
particularly when the UN will decide that Baghdad has met the conditions
imposed by Security Council resolutions. The consequent resumption of Iraqi
oil exports has obvious implications for oil prices, and it will also open
the door for international companies already seeking business in Iraq.
Demands for war reparations and the payment of substantial debt arrears are
certain to amount to well over Dollars 150bn and to take many years to
resolve.
Iran will be in the forefront of those countries seeking compensation for
the damage inflicted during its eight-year war with Iraq. Declining oil
revenues and a ballooning international debt have exacerbated Tehran's
reconstruction problems while continued political rivalries have blocked
most attempts at introducing market-oriented reforms. Iran continues to be a
valuable market for Europe and Japan, but the combination of US hostility
and poor economic management suggests that in the absence of significantly
higher oil prices there is little chance of real growth.
Among the brighter spots in a generally lacklustre Middle East, Morocco and
Tunisia stand out as countries which are addressing their structural
problems while aiming to promote export-led growth through a closer
association with the European Union. But they, too, are forced to keep a
wary eye on neighbouring Algeria where the impact of Islam as a political
force provides another potent example of the dangers which arise when inept
governments fail to tackle the the most basic needs of their populations.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - The World's Economies
 -North America (54): America's Teflon economist - Profile / Alan Greenspan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan has enjoyed an
unusually long, five-year streak of lower interests.
But in February, the Fed changed direction. By mid-August, it had raised
short-term interest rates in five separate stages, lifting the discount rate
by a percentage point to 4 per cent and the federal funds rate by 1 3/4
percentage points to 4 3/4 per cent.
The Fed chairman's position is lonelier when interest rates are rising, and
Mr Greenspan's reputation was all the more firmly in the balance because of
the sharp rise in long-term interest rates, and the corresponding fall in
share prices, which the Fed's reversal triggered.
Stranded by the erratic movements of monetary aggregates, and convinced that
the consumer price index provides only an erratic and tardy reading of
inflation, Mr Greenspan has been compelled to scrutinise an eclectic mix of
statistics to develop his reading of inflationary pressures.
Mr Greenspan's gradualist policy of tightening in small increments was
accused of inflicting a water torture on the markets, which were constantly
anticipating the next small rise in interest rates.
Meanwhile, the Fed chairman was portrayed in a much-criticised book on
President Clinton's economic policy by Bob Woodward, the Washington Post
reporter, as having struck a Mephistophelian bargain with Mr Clinton,
convincing the president that if he cut the budget deficit long-term
interest rates would fall.
At moments, Mr Greenspan appeared in danger of losing the label William
Seidman, the sharp-tongued former chairman of Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation, had once given him: 'the only Teflon economist I know.'
Yet at the same time, decision-making within the Fed has appeared to move
out of the sole control of the chairman and into a more collegiate process
involving the other members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).
This committee, comprising the six central governors and a rotating sample
of the presidents of the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks, meets every six
to eight weeks, and sets the overall framework for monetary policy.
In the past, the FOMC used to recommend a 'symmetric' stance, meaning rates
should stay the same, or an 'asymmetric' stance, opening the way to a rise
or a fall in interest rates; the actual decision to move was left to the Fed
chairman, acting between committee meetings.
This year, however, the FOMC has not only raised interest rates on the day
of its meetings, it has also announced the moves publicly.
Some of the regional Fed presidents, too, have begun to speak out more
openly about their monetary policy views.
'In terms of the management of monetary policy, Greenspan's style has led to
the democratisation of the Federal Reserve policy process,' wrote Manuel
Johnson, who served as vice-chairman under Mr Greenspan and his predecessor,
Paul Volcker, in a recent article in the magazine International Economy.
With most economists now convinced that the economy is gliding into a soft
landing, Mr Greenspan is now getting more credit for his monetary
engineering. Mr Johnson, indeed, says he is 'within striking distance of
becoming one of the most successful chairmen in the history of the Federal
Reserve'.
Mr Greenspan, meanwhile, remains as enigmatic as ever after seven years in
the job. He appeared to take it as a compliment at one recent hearing on
Capitol Hill when a member said he was 'worse than the State Department' in
his ability to avoid answering the question.
He once kept a dinner gathering of Washington economists on tenterhooks for
an entire evening, waiting for some hint of his thinking on monetary policy,
while he regaled them with a discourse on the effects of falling
transportation costs on world trade.
Yet Mr Greenspan, who studied music at the Juilliard School in New York and
played bass clarinet in a jazz band, is quite a socialite, playing weekly
tennis games with Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and featuring prominently
on the Washington cocktail circuit.
With only two years to go before his term expires, however, it is his
relationship with Alan Blinder, the Princeton economist appointed by Mr
Clinton to be vice-chairman, which is under most scrutiny.
At a recent conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, sponsored by the Federal
Reserve bank of Kansas City, Mr Greenspan appeared to wince when Mr Blinder
declared: 'In my view, central banks through macroeconomic policies do have
a role to play in reducing unemployment.'
That may not represent a radical disagreement with Mr Greenspan. Mr Blinder
insisted that this role was in the short term, and that macroeconomic policy
had nothing to do with the unemployment rate five or 10 years out. Mr
Greenspan, for his part, has told visitors he sees the task of the central
bank as promoting economic growth and not only controlling inflation.
Moreover, there appears to be no disagreement between the two on current
monetary policy, at least in the US; Mr Greenspan would never be as
outspoken as Mr Blinder was in his criticism of European monetary policy.
But Mr Blinder may have to learn some of Mr Greenspan's discretion if he is
to take over the chairmanship in 1996.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - The World's Economies
(53): Hopes high for a soft landing - United States / George Graham assesses
the road ahead for the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the first half of this year, the US Federal Reserve has reversed a long
trend of falling interest rates with five successive rate increases. During
this period the US economy continued to grow at a pace that, while not on a
par with the more robust booms of the past, was still undeniably healthy.
Announcing its move on August 16, when it raised the discount rate from 3
1/2 to 4 per cent and the Federal funds rate from 4 1/4 to 4 3/4 per cent,
the Fed said it was responding to 'evidence of continuing strength in the
economic expansion and high levels of resource utilisation'.
'The actions are intended to keep inflationary pressures contained, and
thereby foster sustainable economic growth,' the Fed added.
There has been very little challenge to the Fed's decision to tighten
monetary policy. After all, with growth running at an annualised rate of
more than 6 per cent in the fourth quarter, it was hard to quarrel with Alan
Greenspan, the Fed chairman, when he told Congress that 'there seemed no
reasonable purpose in maintaining the demonstrably stimulative level of
short-term interest rates held throughout 1993'. Indeed, some other Fed
officials come close to saying that they made a mistake by lowering interest
rates too much in 1992 and 1993.
Assessing the need for further monetary tightening, however, is a more
difficult calculation, and one that hinges on one's assessment of the US
economy's future path.
One scenario, espoused by some private sector economists, sees the
development of a typical mature expansion, in which the economy continues to
grow faster than its potential, leading to pressure on capacity and wages.
This in turn would lead to faster inflation, a sharp increase in short-term
interest rates and, eventually, a recession.
Another version, adopted by the Clinton administration and probably by a
majority of private sector economists, sees a softer landing. In this
version of events, the economy is already running out of steam, so that
growth will slow down and inflationary pressures diminish without any need
for the Fed to raise interest rates further.
Although the White House has carefully avoided criticising the Fed for its
latest interest rate increases, some Democratic senators have not been so
cautious, and have accused Mr Greenspan of killing off the expansion
prematurely.
Somewhere between the two scenarios is the Congressional Budget Office,
which sees the economy outrunning its potential to a modest extent,
triggering some further tightening by the Fed to head off inflation, but no
crash landing.
Translated into forecasts for growth and inflation in 1994 and 1995, the
disagreement is not large.
While the administration sees real gross domestic product growing at 3.0 per
cent this year, CBO forecasts 3.6 per cent growth. Both expect 2.7 per cent
growth in 1995.
This is close to the range compiled by the Fed from information provided by
the members of central board and the presidents of the regional Federal
Reserve banks, whose 'central tendency' is real GDP growth of 3 to 3 1/4 per
cent in 1994 and 2 1/2 to 2 3/4 per cent in 1995. Nor is there wide
disagreement on consumer price inflation. The administration expects 2.9 per
cent this year to CBO's 2.8 per cent, within the Fed's 'central tendency' of
2 3/4 to 3 per cent. Both predict 3.2 per cent inflation in 1995, again
within the Fed's range of 2 3/4 to 3 1/2 per cent.
The principal objection to this miraculously soft landing, with no spike in
inflation and no sharp recession, is that it has never happened before.
Although the Fed can claim to have taken pre-emptive action before inflation
started to show up in the price indices, the strains on industrial capacity
and on the labour market which caused it to act may not be easily
forestalled.
The industrial capacity utilisation rate is now running above 83 per cent, a
level which in the past has signalled faster inflation in goods prices -
although these make up only a little over 20 per cent of the consumer price
index if food and energy, prices of which are not dictated by capacity use,
are excluded.
At the same time, job creation at a rate of 285,000 a month in the first
half of the year has lowered the unemployment rate to 6.1 per cent.
Most US economists and policy-makers regard this as being at least very
close to the economy's natural rate, accounted for by structural problems
rather than by the ups and downs of the business cycle.
'Some people think we've passed it, some people think we have a little way
to go. Very few people think we're very far from it,' said Alan Blinder,
vice-chairman of the Fed. Other Fed governors say they are comfortable with
the notion of a rate of around 6.25 per cent.
'I wouldn't quarrel with someone who said 6.0, but 5 is low and 7 is high,'
said one.
That implies that unemployment in the US has already shrunk to the point
where any further decline could trigger pressure on wages and a rise in
inflation, and so justifies the Fed's recent decision to continue tightening
interest rates.
Some economists, however, say there may be more slack in the labour market
than this analysis of the natural rate would suggest. They point to
indicators such as the volume of new jobs advertised, which has risen much
less than in previous expansions.
One element which has not affected the US economy nearly as much as
economists predicted a year ago is the Clinton administration's deficit
reduction programme passed in the 1993 budget. Although the budget deficit
has fallen beyond the White House's wildest dreams - CBO projects Dollars
202bn, or 3.0 per cent of GDP, in 1994 and Dollars 162bn, or 2.3 per cent of
GDP in 1995 - this fiscal contraction did not hold growth down to any
noticeable degree.
The picture may be less promising for the future. In the absence of severe
action to curb government spending, particularly on medical programmes such
as Medicare, which provides health insurance to the elderly, CBO sees the
deficit starting to climb again in 1996, to reach 3.6 per cent of GDP in
2004.
'There is no reason to assume that the trend will be reversed after 2004
unless policies are changed,' CBO warns.

(55): Deficit overshadows prospects - Canada / Bernard Simon finds the
outlook disturbing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Canada's economic prospects look good, bad or middling, depending from which
angle one chooses to view them.
The news could hardly be better on the inflation front. The consumer price
index has settled on a plateau, and is expected to rise by no more than 2-3
per cent in 1995.
Much of the credit goes to tight monetary policies pursued by the Bank of
Canada between 1988 and 1991, which took the wind out of domestic demand.
The latest brake on prices is a steep fall in tobacco taxes, designed to
stamp out cigarette smuggling across the US-Canada border.
Wage settlements are at their lowest level in decades. Workers have
considered themselves lucky these days to get any wage increase at all,
although there are signs that a strengthening economy is starting to loosen
employers' purse-strings.
Meanwhile, double-digit unemployment has helped many companies introduce
more flexible work practices. Productivity has soared.
A weakening currency has further reinforced Canadian companies'
competitiveness. With the help of stronger metal and forest-products prices,
exports rose to a record CDollars 18.2bn in June 1994. Bank of Nova Scotia
forecasts that the trade surplus will climb from CDollars 9.5bn in 1993 to
CDollars 14bn this year and CDollars 17.5bn in 1995.
But seen from another angle, Canada's economic outlook is disturbing. The
federal government has failed over the past decade to meet its budget
deficit targets. The shortfall for the year to March 31, 1994 was a record
CDollars 45.7bn, or 6.4 per cent of gross domestic product.
The 10 provinces, which piled up a combined debt of about CDollars 230bn,
are also battling to rein in their spending. Of the 10, Alberta has made the
most progress, confidently forecasting a balanced budget by 1997. Its reward
has been a credit rating matched only by fast-growing British Columbia.
Finance minister Paul Martin pledged last February to trim the federal
deficit to CDollars 39.7bn in the current fiscal year, and to 3 per cent of
GDP by 1997-98.
But he faces an uphill struggle. Interest rates, and thus debt-service
charges, have been higher than forecast this year. Ottawa is also moving
more slowly than expected on social-security reforms, which are essential
for any meaningful, long-term dent in government outlays.
The heavy debt burden casts a long shadow over Canada's prospects. Bank of
Nova Scotia warned in late August that 'nothing short of a tripling in the
merchandise trade surplus would stem the erosion in Canada's external
balance sheet, let alone begin to play down record foreign obligations.'
Nervousness about the future of Quebec is the other cloud over the economy.
Although the victory of the separatist Parti Quebecois in the francophone
province's election will not necessarily lead to independence, the run-up to
a referendum which the PQ has promised to hold in 1995 could unsettle many
domestic and foreign investors.
The PQ has threatened not to co-operate with the federal government's drive
to overhaul the unemployment insurance and welfare systems. Within Quebec,
it generally favours more government involvement in the economy, including
higher taxes.
'If there was no political uncertainty, our forecast of growth would be
higher, and our interest rates would be lower,' says John McCallum, Royal
Bank of Canada's chief economist.
On balance, however, Mr McCallum and most other economists predict that
positive forces will outweigh negative ones over the next few years. The
Conference Board of Canada forecasts that real GDP growth will accelerate
moderately from 2.7 per cent in 1993 to 3.3 per cent this year and 3.4 per
cent in 1995.
There could be sharp regional variations within these national averages.
Royal Bank expects that British Columbia will enjoy a growth rate of more
than 4 per cent next year, thanks to a continuing influx of migrants and
strong pulp and paper prices. At the other end of the country, the collapse
of the Atlantic fishery will hold Newfoundland's growth to less than 2 per
cent, with one out of five people remaining out of work.
The growth numbers could hinge heavily on whether markets are more impressed
by Canada's improved inflation and productivity performance, or by political
upheavals.
Early this year, the gap between US and Canadian interest rates narrowed to
its smallest in almost two decades. Canadian banks' prime lending rates were
down to 5.5 per cent from a peak of 14.75 per cent in mid-1990. But as
Quebec election jitters grew, the spread once again widened.
By late June, Canadian banks had raised their prime rate to 8 per cent and
economists had begun to lower their 1994 and 1995 growth forecasts. Interest
rates have subsequently moved lower again, but some strong and unpredictable
gyrations could lie ahead.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - The World's Economies
(51): Roller-coaster levels out - Japan / The economy has matured since the
roaring 80s
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The world's second largest economy, emerging from the longest recession
since the war, has grown slower and more mature than it was in the roaring
1980s.
Japan's previous recessions came as the result of external shocks, which
inflicted shallow downturns followed by steep recoveries. The latest
downturn in the economy, following the collapse of a bubble of high asset
prices at the turn of the decade, has its origins in several structural
weaknesses. They suggest that this recovery will be gentler than previous
ones.
Just as Japan's underlying rate of growth slowed after the 1970 oil shock
and the early 1980s' downturns, so has this latest recession sapped a little
of its economic vitality. The range of economic forecasts in Tokyo is for
gross domestic product to recover from stagnation last year, to growth of
something under 1 per cent or up to 2 per cent this year, settling to one or
two points below the 1980s' average annual growth rate of 4.5 per cent.
Japan may only walk rather than run through this recovery, but few doubt
that the worst is over. The main evidence for an upturn includes a 3.9 per
cent annualised increase in GDP in the first quarter of this year, the best
performance for three years. On top of this, the Bank of Japan's latest
Tankan economic survey in May, the most reliable indicator of the short-term
outlook, shows the first improvement in business confidence for five years.
Of course, the economy could well weaken in the summer, for the same reasons
as last year. As in 1993, a government collapse has been followed by a steep
rise in the yen.
But the latest yen appreciation was, at the time of writing, not as sharp as
last summer's, while the forces supporting the economy are more widespread
this year than they were last.
Four government spending packages, totalling Y45,000bn over the past two
years, plus a Y6,000bn income tax rebate this year, have started to take
effect. This is shown in strong rises in housing starts, private consumption
and imports.
The yen's sharp rise may squeeze industry's export earnings, but it has also
helped spur domestic demand, shown in a 7.6 per cent rise in imports in the
first six months of the year and a 5.8 per cent rise in private consumption
in the first quarter.
Japanese consumers, enriched by their strong currency, have flocked to
discount stores, which are often loaded with cheap imported goods.
Industry has at the same time started to reduce its vast inventories of
unsold goods, while industrial production has shown signs of improvement.
Output showed an apparently encouraging rise during the first three months
of this year by comparison with the last quarter of 1993. Individual monthly
figures have switched direction every month since last August, so the upturn
in production is not yet conclusive.
Looking beyond the immediate problems, the later stages of the recovery may
be constrained by three structural problems, deflation, surplus industrial
capacity and the weakness of the financial system.
The flood of cheap imports has helped depress prices, so that the official
measure of consumer price inflation is just under 1 per cent. This does not,
however, include discount stores, so underlying consumer price inflation may
be more in line with the 2 per cent decline in wholesale prices, in which
case Japan's real interest rates look higher than those of the US. An
additional danger is that falling prices might squeeze company profits more
than they stimulate demand.
Surplus capacity will at the same time force the industries that used to be
the engines of Japan's economy to hold down wage increases, new employment
and investment in the mature domestic market. The car industry alone, for
example, still has surplus production capacity of 2m vehicles, equivalent to
the entire car market of Britain or France. The electronics, shipbuilding,
engineering and financial services industries are also going into this
recovery with excess staff.
This means that Japanese companies will continue, as they did in the
recession, to curb recruitment and to encourage early retirement, as a way
to continue bringing down their break-even points without breaking the taboo
against heavy redundancies.
They can also be expected to accelerate the shift in capacity to cheaper
production sites in other Asian countries, the fastest growing destination
for new Japanese investment and exports.
According to a recent survey by the ministry of international trade and
industry, Japanese companies will increase capital investment by 1.1 per
cent in the year to next March, yet most of this new cash will go to the
rest of Asia, which will double its share of Japan's overall foreign
investment to 37.5 per cent.
The financial system, meanwhile, is making slow headway in running down the
burden of bad debts, inherited from the boom in lending on the back of
over-valued property during the sharp rise in asset values of the late
1980s. Since then, commercial property prices have fallen by up to 50 per
cent and have shown no clear sign yet of recovery.
The fear is the experience has made banks so cautious over extending new
loans that the economic recovery may prove hard to finance. This is borne
out by the weak performance of the benchmark indicator of money supply, M2
plus certificates of deposit. It turned the corner early last year, from a
three-year decline, but grew at a mere 1.5 per cent in the year to June,
well below the 5 per cent annual growth which many economists believe is
needed to fund a revival.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - The World's Economies
 -Japan (52): Man who burst the bubble - Profile / Yasushi Mieno
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few individuals have played a more central role in the industrialised
world's harsh transition from the boom years of the 1980s to the sluggish
1990s than the outgoing governor of Japan's central bank, Yasushi Mieno.
Mr Mieno's five-year term, which expires on December 16, has been perhaps
the most challenging of any in the 120-year history of the Bank of Japan.
His tenure began at the tail-end of the extraordinary explosion in Japanese
asset prices that came to be called the 'Bubble Era'. It ends as the country
emerges from its longest post-war recession, a recession induced by a
monetary policy designed to burst the bubble.
That policy, over which Mr Mieno presided, earned him the opprobrium of many
in Japanese business and politics, but they marked an important stage in the
bank's development in gaining for itself greater freedom over its actions,
not just from the iron grip of the ministry of finance, but from the demands
of international economic policy.
Mr Mieno's curriculum vitae suggests a life as the model central banker. His
working life has been spent at the Bank of Japan, including a stint in New
York, and a period managing one of the bank's regional branches. It
culminated in his elevation to the governorship in 1989. But behind the
usual central banker's stony countenance and tortuous syntax, lies a more
complex and colourful character.
Born in 1924, Mr Mieno moved to Manchuria at an early age when his father
was transferred to the Manchuria Railroad Corporation. When his family
returned to Japan during the war, the young son worked as a soap, butter and
clothing trader to support them. He won a place at the prestigious Tokyo
University and, armed with a law degree, joined the Bank of Japan in 1947.
His ascent was steady - 42 years through all the bank's main departments.
His inheritance on assuming the governorship in 1989 could hardly have been
more troubled. The economy was overheating, asset prices were soaring and Mr
Mieno immediately applied the brakes. Within weeks of his taking office the
BoJ raised interest rates by half a percentage point, a move that provoked a
damaging row with the ministry of finance over the direction of monetary
policy. The new governor was anxious to correct what many in the bank
perceived to be the errors of his predecessor in loosening policy too far.
The MoF, concerned about the fallout in the financial markets, resisted Mr
Mieno's pressure for an immediate interest rate increase, but gave way,
sanctioning two further increases in rates over the next eight months.
The effects were startling. The Nikkei 225 Index, which had ballooned to a
peak of nearly 39,000 the month Mr Mieno took office, dropped like a stone,
falling by more than 60 per cent in the next four years. Land prices in
Tokyo fell by two-thirds in the same period. While Mr Mieno may have been
delighted at the dramatic success of his bubble-bursting policy, the damage
done to the real economy was also unprecedented. Output entered a four-year
recession that is only just ending, the worst in the nation's postwar
history.
Though the monetary siege was lifted relatively quickly, with rapid cuts in
interest rates beginning in 1991, the economy and financial markets
continued to plunge and criticism of Mr Mieno increased. Despite the
loosening of policy - the official discount rate was cut to a record low
last September - the economy only began a painfully slow recovery this year,
an upturn that remains weak and uncertain.
Yet, Mr Mieno maintains the harsh medicine was vital to restoring Japan's
long-term prospects and is unapologetic. Despite the pain inflicted on the
country, his term of office saw the stature of the bank, vis-a-vis its more
senior partner, the ministry of finance, rise sharply, as it grew in
independence.
More important, Mr Mieno's term of office has represented a fundamental
shift in the priorities of Japanese economic policy. Japan's emergence in
the 1970s and 1980s as the world's second economic power brought with it at
home the perception of global economic responsibilities that many
policy-makers felt had to be fulfilled.
Most notably, many Japanese politicians and bureaucrats believed that the
country's principal responsibility was to operate its economic policies
within a framework of international co-operation.
This view reached its apotheosis with the Louvre and Plaza accords of the
mid-1980s, when Japanese policy makers bowed to the demands of the US
Treasury and Federal Reserve and agreed to establish a domestic policy
framework consistent with the needs of the dollar. In consequence, Japanese
monetary policy shifted back and forth in line with the gyrations of the US
currency.
Mr Mieno represents a very different school of thought that argues that,
while international monetary co-operation is desirable, it should remain
secondary to domestic monetary considerations. If it is in the best
interests of the Japanese economy to cut interest rates, then cut rates. But
under Mr Mieno they have not been cut to meet broader global demands based
on exchange rate movements and trade flows.
The consequences of this view were most powerfully on display this year,
when Mr Mieno refused to cut Japanese interest rates to prevent the yen
rising against the dollar. He repeatedly argued that Japanese monetary
policy was sufficiently relaxed for Japanese domestic considerations - a
further cut in interest rates was not in Japan's own interests.
That view, which also says that, in the longer run, when countries follow
policies that are first in their own interests they benefit the world
economy, now holds sway not just in Japanese economic policy, but in many
countries. It owes much to the economic philosophy of Mr Mieno.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - The World's Economies
 -Eastern Europe (49): Painful legacy of the past - Russia and the former
Soviet Union states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The former Soviet states have suffered, and are still suffering, a series of
external and internal shocks more serious and crushing than any developed
country has had to withstand since the second world war. They are reeling
under these shocks: their economies - with the exception of the three small
Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - are still plunging because
of them. There are signs, especially in Russia, of improvements, but not yet
of sustained recovery.
These shocks were: the steady degradation of the Soviet economic system,
already evident in the early 1980s and made worse by the misconceived
economic reforms of Mikhail Gorbachev; the steady drop in energy -
especially oil - output, which continues; the ending of the Comecon trading
bloc in 1990; the multiple declarations of national independence at the end
of 1991 which exacerbated the already-evident breaking of industrial and
economic links between the 15 Soviet republics; the creation of separate
currencies, forced on most republics by Russia's decision to make the rouble
a national currency; the ending or curtailing of Russian energy and other
subsidies to the other republics; and the inability or unwillingness of the
new national elites to introduce market economic institutions and practices,
even as they can no longer depend on the old collective institutions.
These have been common in one form or another to all of the states: in some
cases, they have been exacerbated by civil wars - affecting all three of the
transcaucasian states of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia; Tajikistan in
Central Asia; the transdnestrian region of Moldova; and the north Caucasian
republics of Russia, especially Chechnya. In these states and regions,
economies have been ruined for a decade or more. Each has to cope with
hundreds of thousands of refugees, and the state or regional governments are
largely overwhelmed with day-to-day crises, unable to plan or rebuild.
Even in those states which conflict has not touched, the shocks described
above have been numbing in their effects. Industrial output in the most
developed states - Russia, Ukraine, Belarus - has plunged by at least a half
(on official figures, which are unreliable: nevertheless the trend is clear
and is dramatic). Inflation is endemic - and where curbed, as it is in
Russia and has been in Ukraine - the drop in its levels is achieved by
simple axeing of government commitments and programmes which include paying
workers their wages.
There are signs of change. The Baltic states, which now dislike the reminder
that they are 'former Soviet' republics, have wholly (Estonia) or partially
(Lithuania) succeeded in stabilising their economies and have begun the road
towards integration into the European Union which their leaderships have
unambiguously identified as their main goal. In Estonia's case, this was
achieved by text book 'shock therapy' - indexing the kroon to the D-Mark
overnight two years ago, and rendering it illegal to issue credits to fund a
budget deficit. The tiny state now has the highest growth levels in Europe -
though its economy was already the richest of the former Soviet states and
it had relatively little heavy industry.
Russia is the critical case. When, in spring of 1994, the government agreed
with the IMF to bring inflation down to 7 per cent a month this year and to
keep the budget deficit under 10 per cent of GNP in return for the Dollars
1.5bn second tranche of the systemic transformation facility, it seemed a
commitment which would never stand the test of time and of the pressures of
the manifold lobbies which have in the past derailed efforts - including
those of Yegor Gaidar, the former acting prime minister - to keep the
economy on track.
However, as of early September, the government has kept to its pledge -
bringing inflation down from more than 20 per cent a month in January to
under 5 per cent in July, and claiming to be running a budget deficit of
under 10 per cent on an annualised basis. Encouraged by these signs of
monetary stability, foreign portfolio investment in the Russian
privatisation process is climbing very sharply.
This impressive feat - which has reversed the conventional view of Victor
Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, from being one of a barely-altered Soviet
'red director' to a politician determined to institute market reforms - has
not been achieved without pain, nor is it seen as having definitively
shifted the Russian economy on to a reform path.
The government has cut down heavily on credits, but this has meant that
workers have not been paid, investment has been postponed and debts between
the enterprises have rocketed to vast levels. At the same time, there is
little sign of large-scale strategic investment, either by Russian companies
or by foreigners - though the large corporations are increasingly making at
least token investment, while ABB Brown Boveri, the power engineering
company, has taken a (still all but unique) decision to locate much of its
production in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
Russia thus hovers between the past and the future, with no unambiguous sign
that it is prepared to move one way or the other.
The size of Russia, and its virtual monopoly of oil and gas production,
means that all other republics are hugely dependent upon it. This fact of
life has impressed itself on the elites of Ukraine and Belarus, the two
other Slav states, and they have now produced a political leadership anxious
for close ties with Russia and for a continuation of supplies of cheap
energy.
Ukraine's inability to grasp the nettle of reform initially appeared to mean
stability - but in the past year has seen the country's economy sink rapidly
to the point where much of industry is idle at least part of the time, the
currency is chronically prone to inflation and the vast Donbass coal region
sinks under debt.
For the IMF and for the World Bank, the success of reforms in the former
Soviet states is critical to their strategic choices of how reforms should
be conducted elsewhere. Both institutions, especially the Fund, have been
heavily criticised for offering an 'off-the-shelf' prescription emphasising
monetary stability and budgetary discipline: but the critics have yet to
propose a convincing alternative and the Fund has been strengthened by the
acceptance by the Chernomyrdin government of its strategy for this year, and
its success so far in carrying it through.
The reform process here remains the most important in the world: and it
remains among the most uncertain.

transformation has been messy
</HEADLINE>

The greatest conundrum facing 450m people when communism collapsed in
eastern and central Europe five years ago was how to create capitalism
without capital. It seemed an impossible task which became even more
difficult when the demise of the old Comecon trading network led to a
collapse in foreign trade between the former communist states.
Five years on, however, it has become increasingly clear that the end of the
cold war and 'constructive destruction' of the old centrally-planned
economies has liberated capital and resources on a huge scale. Nearly 60 per
cent of the Polish economy is now in the private sector with the Czech
Republic and other 'fast track' reformers of central Europe approaching
similar levels. Domestic capital and savings, not foreign investment, are
emerging as the principal source of finance throughout the region as private
companies re-invest profits, banks re-capitalise to improve their lending
base and embryonic financial institutions such as pension funds and
insurance companies compete for the savings of higher income groups emerging
from greater income differentials.
Inevitably, the process of economic transformation, still far from complete,
has been messy as well as painful and often arbitrary and unfair. The Czechs
pioneered mass privatisation through vouchers on a grand scale,
enthusiastically followed by Russia, and all the former communist states
have their own variant of a mass privatisation programme, flanked by trade
sales and other negotiated disposals, mainly to foreign investors.
But a vast array of state-owned assets has been transmuted into private
property without due process of law - stolen in plain English. All too often
the new 'owners' turn out to be former communist nomenklatura factory owners
or party officials with the right connections. If the early French socialist
thinker Proudhon were still alive he might well have modified his famous
dictum that property is theft to read something like this: 'Socialist
property is theft: the theft of socialist property creates capital.'
Many of those wily enough to survive and prosper under the old regime have
taken to capitalism like ducks to water. In many cases capital once acquired
has been rapidly transferred into bank accounts and other assets abroad -
well over Dollars 50bn is believed to have left the former Soviet Union by
various channels over the past few years.
In practice, it is often used to provide offshore financing for deals within
the former Soviet Union. Much is waiting to return as laundered, ostensibly
legitimate, 'foreign' investment. Victor Geraschenko, chairman of the
Russian National bank, favours a form of amnesty to attract such funds back
to Russia.
Increasingly, however, real new wealth is being created by entrepreneurs
building up their own businesses from modest beginnings, not just the
re-investment of capital acquired during the essentially one-off stage of
'primitive capital accumulation'.
The quickest returns have come from trade - a path blazed by the Poles who
dominated illegal trading throughout the former Soviet bloc and jumped at
the new opportunities opened up by convertibility of the zloty. Currency
convertibility was a key element in Poland's January 1990 stabilisation
programme and loomed large in similar market reform programmes throughout
the bloc.
Increasing amounts of domestic capital are going into productive industry,
although the bulk of such investment to date has come from western
multinationals.
But for millions of individuals and families in the former Soviet bloc now
free to engage fully in economic activity, the main opportunities to enter
business with limited amounts of capital have come in the service sectors so
neglected under central planning, but so vital for job creation.
Thousands of companies have been formed and millions of new jobs have been
created over the past five years in retailing and wholesaling, banking and
finance, insurance, marketing, media, advertising and communications,
tourism and the like. They have not fully compensated for the loss of jobs
in the old state industries and military establishments. Unemployment
typically ranges from 10-15 per cent, except for the Czech Republic where
service sector growth is highest and where artificially low wages have kept
many under-employed on factory payrolls.
Meanwhile, mass privatisation programmes have created millions of small
shareholders and the short-lived boom in share prices on the fledgling
bourses of Warsaw, Prague and Budapest last year both attracted popular
attention to the potential merits of share ownership and permitted the first
quoted companies to raise cheap equity. The longer-term task of creating
efficient banks and other financial institutions like insurance companies
and pension funds is under way.
Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary are most advanced along the path to
becoming 'normal' market economies, but seemingly unlikely candidates such
as Estonia, Slovenia and even Albania have shown in their differing ways how
small economies can be swiftly turned around, given tight fiscal and
monetary management, a modicum of technical advice and financial assistance,
entrepreneurial flair and a handful of dedicated market reformers.
Poland and Bulgaria in particular have also benefited from successful debt
reduction agreements which have reduced the burden of repayment and
re-opened access to normal commercial borrowing and foreign equity
investment. Prior to these agreements both countries were heavily dependent
on help from the international financial institutions (IFIs) - especially
the IMF and World Bank.
But as restructuring progresses and economic growth returns, reliance on the
IFIs is falling as foreign equity investment and commercial bank operations
become more available.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - The World's Economies
 -Europe (48): Hidden reserves of strength - Turkey / It can weather shocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FINKEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On a sunny weekend last spring, the combined retail muscle of the Turkish
automobile industry pulled together to sell exactly one new car. This
compares with previous figures of more than 1,000 a day. After a devaluation
crisis in January, and an austerity package in April, the Turkish economy
appeared well on its knees.
Or was it? With an ingenious bit of fixing, the two leading car
manufacturers, Renault and Tofas (Turkish Fiat), persuaded the government to
lower VAT. After some judicious price-cutting of their own, they managed by
the end of the summer to offload their entire back stock.
If Turkey's present difficulties prove anything, it is the ability of the
country to weather incredible shocks. First quarter growth figures of 3.5
per cent turned into a second quarter decline of 10.6 per cent, a spread of
14 per cent. Yet, part of the country's reserves of strength and true
liquidity are hidden in an unregistered economy estimated to be at least
half the size of the one on the books. Although Turkish industry may not be
the world's most competitive (the World Economic Forum rates it 29th), low
and still falling wage levels means it is not in terrible shape.
'It's not the economy that's ill; it's the total collapse of anything
related to the state,' according to Professor Asaf Savas Akat, economic
adviser to the fringe New Democracy Party. His is not the eternal lament of
a private sector which wants the government off its back, but the
increasingly common exasperation at the inability of successive governments
to get on with fiscal reform. Even if it were leaner, Turkish industry would
still have trouble competing with a state apparatus hungry to finance even
its current expenditure.
Clear indication of the problem is not just the public sector borrowing
requirement (PSBR) ratio (17.5 per cent of GNP last year) but the exorbitant
price which the government paid to re-enter the domestic debt market
following this year's 60 per cent devaluation of the Turkish lira. Recently
redeemed T-bills offered a 50 per cent real return over three months
(equivalent to Libor plus 195]) - a figure better then commercial rates.
This in effect limits corporate lending to all but short-term trade finance.
'The good companies don't borrow, and who wants to lend to the others?' said
one western member of Istanbul's banking community.
Anxious to restore Turkey's international standing Tansu Ciller, Turkey's
prime minister, has gone through the procedure of applying for a largely
symbolic standby arrangement with the IMF for Dollars 509.3m as an
endorsement of the economic package she introduced on April 5.
Working in Turkey's favour is that reduced domestic demand for imports along
with the return on short-term government paper has eased the trade position.
Foreign reserves have recovered from the central bank's Dollars 3bn battle
to uphold the value of the lira. Currency stability is regarded as important
in the fight against three-figure inflation, and the lira has survived a
drop in the terms of new Treasury auctions. Although 12-month inflation
figures are still at 126.5 per cent, this is partly the result of the
one-off price rises in state-controlled goods last April. There is some
evidence that the domestic doldrums may have at last detoxified the market
of its inflationary expectations.
Short-term outstanding external debt has also declined by roughly a third to
Dollars 12bn. This is something of a mixed blessing, signalling as it does
the demise of a strategy of 'hot money' through which foreign exchange was
lured into Turkish lira. It does mean, however, that Turkey is unlikely to
renege on its foreign commitments and thus lose its IMF seal of approval.
Standard and Poor's, whose downgrading of Turkish debt helped spark off this
year's crisis, no longer retains Turkey on its credit watch.
The result is that the Turkish government has rolled over its debts on the
internal market. Given the lower value of the lira, the burden will be at a
higher real cost as a percentage of GNP. About two thirds of targeted fiscal
savings is through expenditure restraint and keeping budget allocations
static.
Those negotiating Turkey's entry into customs union with the EU believe that
the crisis must reinforce the good habits which the country will need to
make closer integration a success.
This would in turn encourage much needed direct investment. If industrial
assets continue to be devalued, then Turkey may well recover some of its
attractiveness as an emerging market.
Much depends on whether the government has the will to undertake structural
reform. This would include the privatisation or disposal of the wasteful
state sector, the reform of the social security system, and also a permanent
change in the structure of agricultural support prices. Another area of
reform is the creation of a more efficient and equitable tax base.
While Turkey braces itself for another hard contraction of domestic demand,
an election is not something that Mrs Ciller desires. Recent blips in the
Turkish lira have more to do with the Central Bank trying to ease down
interest rates then a widespread conviction in an early poll.
For all that, Mrs Ciller's position, and that of the coalition government
with its mere three-seat majority, is far from strong.
The government has been forced to call by-elections on December 4 to fill 22
vacancies in the present parliament. Those caused by the expulsion from
parliament of Kurdish nationalist MPs are likely to result in victories for
the pro-Islamic Welfare Party.
This has established itself as a powerful alternative in the south-east of
the country to the nationalists. In other contests, too, the government is
likely to reap the ill effects of austerity measures.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - The World's Economies
 -Europe (47): Prescription could fall well short of a cure - Spain / The
host country for this year's meetings has the OECD's highest jobless rate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The economy in Spain, host nation for this year's IMF and World Bank
meetings, is recovering like those in other OECD member states. But, in its
effort to achieve sustainable GDP growth, Spain may face greater problems
than many of its partners.
The Madrid authorities can take credit for laying the foundations for sound
money. They are curbing inflation and cutting back on the general government
deficit. The current account balance of payments deficit, which was slightly
above 3 per cent of GDP in 1992 and narrowed to 0.8 per cent in 1993, is
expected this year to break even or show a slight surplus.
The devalued peseta has had an electric effect on exports and on tourism
receipts, amply compensating for weak domestic demand. GDP growth is on line
to reach possibly as much as 2 per cent this year.
Yet, the patient in this case is especially sick and the prescription could
still fall well short of a cure. Even when there was a healthy current
account surplus, as there was in the mid-1980s, and even when GDP growth
outstrips that of the OECD average, as occurred in those years, unemployment
has remained very high and participation rates very low.
Spain has the highest jobless level in the OECD - a gap of around 10 points
has for several years separated Spain's unemployment level from that of the
OECD average - and the participation rate of its working age population is,
at 49 per cent, embarrassingly low in comparison with those of its trading
partners.
At the end of June, Spain's jobless total stood at 3.7m, 24.2 per cent of
the working population, according to the government's quarterly employment
survey. This figure followed a net job rise of nearly 30,000 in May and
June.
Such statistics, indicating that one in four Spaniards of working age are
idle, should be balanced against estimates which suggest that as many as 1m
are employed in the submerged or informal economy. The political fall-out of
such a high jobless rate is, in addition, contained by the extended family
network that for the time being remains strongly entrenched in Spanish
society.
The economic ministry's latest forecast is that in December the number of
employed Spaniards should be slightly higher than the 11.7m registered in
December 1993. Should the number of workers rise in December, the increase
will represent the first positive inter-annual variation since the third
quarter of 1991.
The problem, however, is not that there are very few people working in
Spain, but that not enough jobs have existed for Spaniards for a long time.
In a recent report, ICAE, the economic analysis institute of Madrid's
Complutense University, noted bluntly that over the past 20 years the
Spanish economy had 'shown itself to be manifestly incapable of generating
sufficient jobs'.
Diminishing employment is a general story in the European Union but nowhere
is it more compellingly serious than in Spain: over the past 30 years
Spain's GDP has tripled in volume and the domestic population has grown by
25 per cent. But with just under 11.7m employed, there are no more job
holders in 1994 than there were in 1964.
The consequence of the domestic economy's structural imbalances, as
evidenced by the unemployment level, is that when these disequilibriaare
added to the cyclical problems which the Spanish economy shares with the
rest of the OECD, international markets are prompted to set Spain's finances
apart, and to penalise them accordingly. When bond yields rose in Europe
earlier this year, on the back of interest rate rises in the US, they became
especially volatile in Spain.
To the dismay of a domestic industry which desperately needs internal demand
to be kick-started, Spain's economic ministry acknowledged in its latest
bulletin that the great increase in the yield of long-term domestic bonds
has 'provoked a more prudent posture' on the part of the monetary
authorities. On August 3, the Bank of Spain cautiously lowered its key
intervention to 7.35 per cent from 7.50 per cent, its first cut since May
13.
There are several factors behind the Spanish economy's incapacity to create
jobs, including labour costs. If the OECD had an 'oil shock' in the 1970s,
Spain had both that and a 'salaries shock' on top of it. Rises in wages
continued through the 1980s and up to December last year when, despite a 3.5
per cent fall in registered employment during 1993, real wages rose by 1.5
per cent compared with December 1992.
Between 1987-1992 Spain registered a 42.2 per cent leap in unit labour
costs, measured in domestic currency terms, against an average rise of 12.8
per cent in the Benelux nations, and Denmark, France and Germany. The OECD
said in its 1994 report on the Spanish economy that 'in order to keep the
wage bill under control, firms are obliged to shed labour massively when
there is a cyclical or structural shock.'
The rigidity of Spain's labour market legislation is viewed as another chief
cause behind joblessness. Employers are deterred from increasing their
labour force by rulings which are based on General Franco's job-for-life
model. The growth of trade union muscle since democracy was restored after
Franco's death in 1975, as well as the social security burden placed on
employers, has helped to create an environment unfriendly to business.
A third factor is the paucity of vocational training in Spain, together with
a mismatch between the supply of labour and the working positions that
demand to be filled. According to the OECD only 16 per cent of Spain's total
1990-1992 expenditure on unemployment went on training and job creation
schemes. Average EU spending on such programmes represents 34 per cent of
unemployment-linked expenditure.
The domestic recession, that began to bite extremely deeply in 1993 when the
economy shrank by 1 per cent, has finally had an impact on wage increases
and on unit labour costs. Wage agreements this year represent average salary
increases of little more than 3 per cent, against a year-on-year headline
inflation rate of 4.7 per cent in June, and unit labour costs have risen by
about 2 per cent.
The rigidities of the labour market have been addressed by a reform of the
existing legislation approved by parliament this year. The overhaul, which
made hiring and firing rules more flexible and cheaper, and which allowed
for part-time employment and altered guidelines on job mobility and job
classifications, was viewed as timid by employers and as Draconian by trade
unions.
The labour market reforms also gave an impetus to apprenticeship and youth
employment schemes. These, together with a national programme for vocational
training which was the outcome of a government agreement last year with
employers organisations and the unions, seek to correct the employment
mismatch and to make inroads into the very high jobless rate among
first-time job seekers.
A start has been made in tackling the most searing feature of Spain's
structural imbalances but it is only a start. Madrid's Complutense
University's ICAE report ominously asserts that the domestic jobless problem
is 'of such a magnitude that a substantial reduction of the unemployment
rate, to a level similar to that of the more advanced European nations, is
not feasible in either the short or in the medium-term.'

FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - The World's Economies
 -Europe (46): After Banesto, a period of hectic change - Tom Burns on the
banking upsets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hardly surprising that the press and other media should have
concentrated so heavily on bankers and banks in Spain during 1994.
Seldom can a domestic banking system have undergone such a change in so
short a space of time.
Over a hectic six months, the country's highest profile banker, Banesto
chairman Mario Conde, left his job, a bevy of top Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, BBV,
executives switched employers, and the power of Banco Santander chairman
Emilio Botin increased greatly.
A former Bank of Spain governor spent two weeks in jail and his successor
gained an autonomy that other central bank heads, excepting the Bundesbank,
might well envy.
Mr Conde's departure from Banesto triggered Mr Botin's rise to become the
nation's number one private banker. On December 28 last year, the Bank of
Spain dismissed Mr Conde, together with his entire board, after its
inspectors had discovered that it had grossly overvalued Banesto's assets,
and on April 25 Santander's Mr Botin paid USDollars 2.05bn to acquire the
troubled group in Spain's biggest domestic takeover.
Cash-rich Santander outbid BBV to gain the Banesto prize and in so doing
ruined its rival's ambitions to become the top Spanish bank. Mr Botin
twisted the knife by hiring an entire BBV senior management team that had
been seconded to run Banesto after its intervention in a caretaker capacity
at the request of the Bank of Spain.
Events were just as fast-paced at the Bank of Spain. At the same time as the
Bank's governor Luis Angel Rojo was successfully concluding the Banesto
rescue package by preparing a public auction in which Santander was to
deliver its winning takeover bid, the headlines were devoted to a tax
evasion scandal involving his predecessor Mariano Rubio.
There was further irony in the approval by parliament of a Bank of Spain
autonomy law on the very day when Mr Rubio was released from prison on
surety of Dollars 72,500. Understandably, the politicians built in
last-minute additions to the autonomy law that established strict rulings to
prevent the illicit enrichment of the bank's officials.
In line with the Maastricht treaty's provisions for central bank autonomy,
Mr Rojo has the responsibility for setting monetary policy and becomes the
effective guardian of price stability.
The days when the governor was virtually nominated in rotation by the
leading private banks are long gone and will never return.
The more recent days when the governor was appointed by the government to
bail it out of trouble are also over.
Under the terms of the autonomy law, parliament votes the governor into the
job for a six-year period and the Bank of Spain is prohibited from financing
the treasury and other public institutions.
The banking sector that Mr Rojo supervises is very different from the one
that he first dealt with just two years ago when he succeeded the now
disgraced Mr Rubio.
The most visible change is that whereas before there were several leading
domestic banks, each of which could claim superiority over the others in
some area of the financial business, now there is the Santander-Banesto
group and the rest.
The takeover represents the culmination, at least for the time being, of a
banking merger process that began in 1988 when Banco Bilbao and Banco
Vizcaya joined forces to form BBV and continued three years later when Banco
Central and Banco Hispanoamericano merged to form Banco Central Hispano,
BCH. Subsequently the state-controlled banking institutions were pooled
together under their flagship Banco Exterior to form Argentaria, a banking
corporation which was partially privatised in 1993.
Santander stood aside from the merger process and instead turned its
attentions abroad, buying more than 20 per cent of First Fidelity in the US
and acquiring a 10 per cent stake in Royal Bank of Scotland.
It also built up its merchant banking unit, Santander de Negocios, now
renamed Santander Investment, into a strong force in Latin America's
emerging markets.
At the time of the Banesto acquisition Santander's foreign-based business
was responsible for close to 50 per cent of its healthy net annual profits.
Santander's forceful return to Spain, where with one acquisitive stroke it
has become the dominant parti-cipant in the domestic market, was
foreshadowed by a series of aggressive strategies designed to weaken the
margins of its rivals, and not least those of Banesto its eventual target.
It introduced a high interest-bearing current account one year, an
innovative unit trust savings scheme another year and a home loan product
the next.
Now that it has achieved the dominance it sought, San-tander looks destined
to make a more lasting impact on the domestic sector by altering the
traditional banking model in Spain, which, much on the lines of German
institutions, involves close ties between the country's banks and its
leading industries.

post-ERM progress
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
On few occasions since the second world war can the headline statistics on
the British economy have been quite so good.
Economic growth in 1994 looks set to be more than 3 per cent and should be
higher than inflation, which hovers around the lower half of the
government's 1-4 per cent target range.
Interest rates, even after this month's unexpected base rate rise, are low
by historic standards. Unemployment is falling. And while there is a trade
deficit, it appears to be edging downwards.
Unfortunately for the Conservative government, economic success has not
translated into political popularity and sceptics think the good news will
not last.
Many believe that at some point in the present recovery, the old British
cycle of boom and bust, of inflation and balance of payments crises, will
return.
Critics also point out that the fall in unemployment has not been matched by
a corresponding increase in employment; in other words, discouraged workers
have dropped off the register rather than taken jobs.
Furthermore, those new jobs which have been created have been largely
part-time.
Nevertheless, the economic picture looks infinitely better than seemed
likely at the time of Britain's humiliating departure from the exchange rate
mechanism in September 1992. For a start, devaluation did not lead to higher
inflation, as many expected. And, perhaps more by luck than judgment, the
post-ERM policy structure has performed fairly well.
A combination of a 1-4 per cent inflation target and a greater role for the
Bank of England gave the UK's economic policies some much needed
credibility.
The markets now perceive that it would be difficult for any Chancellor of
the Exchequer to make politically-inspired base rate cuts in the face of the
opposition of the governor of the Bank of England, especially as the
latter's displeasure would quickly be made public through the medium of the
meeting's minutes. The government also took decisive steps to bring the
public sector deficit under control. Credibility was boosted further by
Kenneth Clarke's decision this month to raise base rates to 5.75 per cent
from 5.25 per cent.
The government's success in cutting the budget deficit, while incurring
political unpopularity because of tax increases, has helped save Britain
from the kind of problems which have enveloped debt-prone Belgium, Italy and
Sweden.
Much economic debate centres on the size of the so-called 'output gap', the
difference between actual and potential output resulting from recession.
Theory suggests that once the output gap disappears, inflationary pressures
start to emerge with capacity constraints. But while an output gap exists,
Britain can grow at an above trend rate, without boosting inflation.
It all depends,on the size of the gap and the long-term trend rate of
growth. The problem for policy makers and analysts is that nobody knows the
size of the output gap or has a very clear idea about the trend rate of
growth. Economic debate, therefore, often has an 'angels on a pinhead' feel.
But one important and connected issue is whether the UK has failed to invest
enough to allow for sustainable long-term growth at an annual rate of 2 per
cent plus
Investment in UK manufacturing fell by a third between 1989 and the second
quarter of 1994, leaving it at its lowest level as a proportion of GDP for
more than 30 years. Confederation of British Industry surveys show only a
modest increase in manufacturers' intentions to invest, despite more than
two years of GDP growth.
Nevertheless, there has been some sign of a pick-up in investment in 1994.
Companies seem to have used the early stages of recovery as a chance to
repay their debt and repair their balance sheets. Now that task is largely
completed, they can invest some of their healthy profits. Manufacturing
investment rose in the second quarter of 1994 for the first time in two
years.
On the demand side, there are signs that consumer spending, which played a
strong part in the early stages of the recovery, might be slowing down.
Second quarter GDP figures showed an encouraging shift in the 'mix' of
economic growth. Exports contributed more than half the 1 per cent
quarter-on-quarter rise.
Meanwhile, consumer spending, having risen by 1 per cent plus in each of the
past two quarters of 1993, grew by only 0.3 per cent in the first quarter of
1994 and 0.2 per cent in the second quarter. An export and investment-led
recovery is the ideal outcome, in most economists' eyes.
The new low levels of mortgage lending have been an important factor in
restraining the growth rate of broad money - M4. Although narrow money, M0,
has consistently grown outside its 0-4 per cent target range, monetarists
argue that inflation is unlikely to be a threat while M4 growth is so
sluggish.
Another inflationary demon, escalating wage increases, is still relatively
subdued. While there was a jump in the annual rate of growth in average
earnings in early 1994, the summer saw the rate stabilise at a modest 3 3/4
per cent.
One cloud on the inflation horizon appears to be higher commodity prices.
These may be a small part of manufacturers' costs, but could still have a
knock-on effect on consumer prices.
While inflation indicators are barely flashing amber, what about that other
British economic bugbear, the trade deficit? There are some signs of
improvement, with exporters benefiting from a weak pound.
In the second quarter of 1994, the current account deficit dropped below
Pounds 1bn, thanks to a sharply improved exports and a robust invisibles
surplus. Meanwhile, the visible trade deficit fell to Pounds 2.4bn in the
second quarter, from Pounds 3bn in the first quarter.
However, these figures need to be treated with caution.
It may be that Britain is at just the stage of the cycle when the numbers
look good; when there is enough spare capacity for the economy to grow
without causing inflation, or sucking in imports. Or it may be that there
has been a genuine shift towards a low inflation era and a more efficient
industrial sector. It is too early in the economic cycle to settle the
argument.
But if the pessimists are right, the government's electoral prospects may be
the chief victim.

Some 16 months into the job, Kenneth Clarke is emerging as a one of the more
impressive chancellors in Britain's post-war history.
His decision earlier this month to raise UK interest rates by half a
percentage point while inflation was at a 27-year low showed he was prepared
to act as well as talk tough to nip incipient inflationary pressures in the
bud.
In his first Budget, 10 months ago, he showed similar decisiveness, raising
taxes and cutting public spending to quicken the pace at which the UK's
budget deficit is lowered.
Both actions showed that Mr Clarke is prepared to take political risks to
establish a record of economic prudence.
Although the UK economy grew at a rapid 3.8 per cent in the first half of
this year, the interest rate rise could still backfire if recent signs of a
slight slowdown in the growth of consumer demand presage a more significant
reversal of the recovery from the recession of the early 1990s.
The tax rises, coming on top of those decided in the March 1993 Budget of
the former chancellor Norman Lamont, added up to one of the most severe
fiscal tightenings in Britain this century. It would have been easy to
imagine another incoming chancellor, whose experience of high office had
been in spending ministries, looking at a then uncertain recovery and at the
Tory party's very poor ranking in the opinion polls and deciding on a less
radical course.
But, unusually for a British politician, Mr Clarke is prepared to take a
medium-term view of the economy and politics. He is serious when he says he
wants to avoid the boom and bust cycles that have so often plagued Britain
since the second world war.
Realising how UK economic policies suffer from a credibility gap, he has
acted to accord a greater role in monetary policy to the Bank of England. He
has moved to make policy more transparent and accountable, notably through
publishing the minutes of his monthly meetings with Eddie George, the Bank
of England governor.
His aim, stated in his 'Mansion House speech' to the City in June is 'a long
period of healthy balanced growth, which creates jobs and sees gradually
higher living standards for all'.
He has faith that the British people will respect a government that 'sticks
to its prospectus' of putting the public finances on an even keel at the
expense of short-term populist measures. He has pledged to keep tight
control of public expenditure and only permit tax cuts when the country can
afford them. In hammering home this message, he has cut through the old
convention that a chancellor should stay silent about tax plans in the
months ahead of his Budget.
At the press conference to announce this month's rise in UK bank base rates
to 5.75 per cent from 5.25 per cent, Mr Clarke bluntly ruled out tax cuts in
his forthcoming Budget on November 29. Tax cuts would jeopardise recovery.
Even if the public sector borrowing requirement were likely to end up lower
than the Pounds 36bn forecast for the 1994-95 financial year it would be
'hopelessly premature' to lower taxes in November. Giving the idea 'no
chance', he dismissed it as 'not serious politics'.
In fact, Mr Clarke, when thinking about politics, gives the British public
far more credit for economic common sense than many of his colleagues in the
House of Commons or analysts in the City.
While making clear that his long-term goal is to cut taxes, he told his
audience at the Mansion House that: 'The public are usually more sensible
than politicians and the press. They will not put their confidence in a
government that cuts taxes before getting borrowing under control.'
He is equally determined not to generate a 'fraudulent, inflationary feel
good factor' among the electorate. This would soon turn 'to 'feel very bad'
as the bust followed the boom'.
Such earthy common sense reflects a man who has risen to high office and yet
never lost sight of his relatively humble origins as the son of a
hard-working watch repairer in Nottinghamshire, in Britain's industrial
Midlands.
Mr Clarke's climb up the political greasy pole began with scholarship
successes to the upmarket Nottingham High School and to Cambridge University
where he studied law and forged early alliances with fellow students who
were to form the 'Cambridge Mafia' in the Tory governments of the 1970s and
1980s.
But his political career has been anything but smooth. Although he was just
under 30 when he won the Nottinghamshire seat of Rushcliffe in 1970, the
choice of Margaret Thatcher as Tory leader in 1975 left him isolated. As one
of the party's more prominent young left-wingers and and a pro-European, he
stayed a junior minister until 1985.
After entering the cabinet as a minister in the department of employment, he
won a reputation as a battler against vested interests. As health secretary
he began the controversial reforms of the National Health Service and became
embroiled in politically costly disputes with doctors and ambulance workers.
He won few friends among the educational establishment as education
secretary and as home secretary courted trouble by seeking to restructure
the police.
That he was appointed chancellor in May 1993 was a measure of the failure of
the government's policy to peg sterling to the D-Mark in the European
exchange rate mechanism and the inability of Mr Lamont, his hapless
predecessor, to recover from the humiliation of the pound's forced exit from
the ERM two years ago.
Mr Clarke has been lucky at the Treasury. He inherited an economy with low
inflation and low interest rates that was recovering more strongly from
recession than people recognised at the time.
This month's decision to raise interest rates is a pointer to more testing
times ahead. The chancellor's response to date has been characteristically
robust. It remains to be seen whether such bravery yields the desired
economic and political rewards.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - The World's Economies
 -Europe (42): Brighter future ahead - Benelux countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The faster-than-expected recovery in Germany is having a locomotive effect
on the economies of Belgium, the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of
Luxembourg. Pulled along by their powerful neighbour, the Benelux countries
are looking at a brighter future based on low inflation and solid growth.
The recovery - coupled with relative currency stability since the upheavals
of 1992/93 - has rekindled hopes of a European monetary union taking shape
before the end of the century. No one should underestimate the technical and
political difficulties which lie ahead; but the Benelux countries,
traditionally the most integrationist-minded in Europe, can reasonably
expect to be in the vanguard of a hard core of committed countries intent on
creating a single currency and able to do so.
The blackest cloud on the horizon is unemployment. Without annual growth
reaching between 3 per cent to 3.5 per cent, there is little prospect of
creating the new jobs to reduce the length of the dole queues. Without new
jobs, especially for young people, the prospect looms of expensive
subsidised work programmes, lost employment revenues, pressure on public
deficits, perhaps even social unrest.
Starting with the European Commission's White Paper on jobs, competitiveness
and growth, a series of official studies have argued that a cyclical
recovery alone will not be enough to reduce unemployment in Europe. As the
latest report by the Paris-based Organisation of Economic Co-operation and
Development makes clear, this economics lesson applies just as much to the
traditionally virtuous Benelux countries as it does to their laxer EU
partners.
The OECD remedy is an assault on 'structural unemployment'. In effect, this
means dismantling rigidities in the labour market, as well as reductions in
the minimum wage and welfare benefits to prod people into looking for work.
What makes these measures so painful in the Benelux countries is that they
challenge the post-second world war model of the social market economy and
welfare state which lies at the core of their political identity.
By the Netherlands' own narrow definition of unemployment, only about 7 per
cent of the labour force is out of work. But the more telling figures are
contained in the OECD's broader definition which takes in all people of
working age receiving disability and other types of social security
benefits, as well as people enrolled in special job creation programmes. By
this measure, unemployment in the Netherlands stands at 25 per cent.
How does the new Dutch coalition government headed by Prime Minister Wim Kok
intend to grapple with this challenge? The first move will be to reduce
taxes and social premiums to encourage employers to hire job-seekers.
Second, the government will examine whether some sectors in the economy may
warrant exemption from the minimum wage laws so as to generate more
entry-level jobs. Third, the state is likely to create an estimated 40,000
jobs in areas such as home help for the elderly, child care, public safety
and security.
The one area which seems certain to remain taboo is unemployment benefit. No
one is talking about reducing unemployment benefit to put pressure on people
out of work to leave the dole. Perhaps that is inevitable given Mr Kok's
Labour party background. But the coalition government knows that even if
economic growth creates, say, 230,000 jobs over the next four years, it will
not be enough to compensate for the 300,000 expected to enter the workforce
over the same period.
In Belgium, similar worries about unemployment cloud the economic debate.
This year, the number out of work is likely to be just over 10 per cent.
With growth likely to be marginally under the Netherlands' projection of
around 2.5 per cent, there is little prospect of reducing unemployment.
The coalition government led by Jean-Luc Dehaene is setting great store by
the 'global pact' concluded with employers last year which amounts to the
most ambitious attempt to curb social spending since the second world war.
As part of the package, new energy taxes should be recycled into the
tradeable goods sector to reduce employers' payroll taxes. According to
Alfons Verplaetse, governor of the Belgian national bank, this could create
50,000 new jobs
On the brighter side, the Belgium and Luxembourg economic union is likely to
show a handsome surplus in the current account this year of BFr400 bn, or 5
per cent of GDP. This figure is double the average surpluses of the second
half of the 1980s. Most important, the mix has changed, with about half of
the surplus ending up on the trade account.
What is striking is that three-fifths of this surplus comes from Belgium,
whereas the banking centre of Luxembourg traditionally accounted for around
three-quarters. So why are Belgian exports rising so fast when Belgian wages
are marginally higher than in neighbouring markets and Belgium is paying a
competitive price for its hard franc policy?. The suspicion, says Phillipe
Maystadt, Belgium's finance minister, is that the adjustment is taking place
through higher unemployment.
The Netherlands and Belgium face stiff challenges to restore public finances
after the recession. But both realise that this is the precondition for EMU
which sets targets of 3 per cent of GDP for the annual budget deficit and 60
per cent of GDP for accumulated government debt.
After several years of steady, albeit small falls, the annual budget deficit
in the Netherlands in 1995 and 1996 is expected to be static at 3.3 per cent
of GDP. It is then expected to fall to 3.1 per cent in 1997 and 2.9 per cent
in 1998.
In Belgium, the government is forecasting that the annual budget deficit is
likely to be an uncomfortably high 5.3 per cent in 1994; but thereafter
officials are confident that it will drop sharply to 4.3 per cent in 1995
and 3 per cent in 1996 (which just happens to be the year when the Maastrict
review of early candidates for EMU will take place).
In the short-term, the Benelux countries must hold their nerve. Having
survived a traumatic recession, the governments need to continue the painful
reforms in labour markets and to contain budget deficits. EMU is both the
incentive and the prize.

Brown-Humes examines the four economies

Some of Europe's best rates of growth will be found in the Nordic area this
year as a steady recovery from the region's deepest recession since the
1930s gains momentum. For the first time since 1990, Sweden, Finland,
Denmark and Norway will all see their economies expand. In the case of
Denmark and Norway, gross domestic product will probably rise by more than 4
per cent, putting them at the top of the European growth league.
Despite this, the deterioration in the international bond market this year
has had a particularly severe impact on the Nordic region and led to a
renewed focus on some of the area's underlying problems. The markets are
alarmed at the prospect of a new surge in inflation. They are worried about
the state of government finances in Sweden and Finland. And they are
fretting about the round of EU referendums due later in the autumn. The
nervous mood has forced up bond yields, worsening government finances and
slowing the pace of the recovery.
But at least there is a recovery - which is a marked contrast with the past
three years when the Nordics were battered by high interest rates, slumping
demand, rising unemployment and financial sector crisis. Worst hit were
Sweden and Finland which both recorded three consecutive years of negative
economic growth. In Finland, where the general difficulties were exacerbated
by the collapse of trade with the former Soviet Union, GDP shrank by 13 per
cent between 1991 and 1993. In Sweden GDP fell 5 per cent over the same
period.
Common factors behind the revival have been a sharp drop in short-term
interest rates and a strengthening world economy. Otherwise the pattern
shows a marked difference between Finland and Sweden, which have relied on
exports to assist their recovery after the sharp weakening of their
currencies in the past two years, and Denmark and Norway where the momentum
has been assisted by fiscal expansion. The difference is that budget
deficits have constrained Finland and Sweden to keep a tight grip on
spending while Norway and Denmark, with low budget deficits, have been able
to promote a recovery in domestic demand through fiscal expansion.
Nowhere has the recent pressure been felt more keenly than in Sweden and
Finland, where politicians' attempts to talk up the economy have been
sabotaged by the controversy surrounding large budget deficits and rising
state debt. Bonds in both countries have taken a mauling. In Sweden, for
example, 10-year bonds have traded at more than 400 basis points above their
German equivalent (contrast Denmark where the gap has been nearer to 200
basis points). Many of Sweden's leading financial institutions have been hit
by the turmoil, prompting Skandia, one of the country's two leading
insurers, to announce a boycott of Swedish bonds in early July.
Although bond markets worldwide have been turbulent since US interest rates
began climbing earlier this year, sentiment towards Sweden has deteriorated
for two reasons. One is the wretched state of the country's finances and
doubts about the readiness of politicians to tackle the problem with
sufficient vigour.
Second, investors have been demanding a risk premium because of fears that
inflation will be rekindled. Sweden has a poor record on inflation as well
as a reputation for resorting to devaluation to sort out its problems.
Although price rises have been remarkably subdued following the country's
last devaluation in 1992, inflationary pressures have started to build
because of capacity constraints. As a result, the central bank, the
Riksbank, increased short-term interest rates in August.
The depressed domestic economy and the rise in interest rates means
forecasters are shaving their earlier growth predictions. At the gloomy end
of the range is Nordbanken which now expects Sweden's GDP to grow by just 1
per cent this year, and 2 per cent in 1995. This is much the lowest rate in
the region and has helped raise the spectre of a new economic trough
characterised by low growth and high interest rates. The winners of the
recent election, the Social Democrats, have promised big tax rises which
will almost certainly restrain any increase in demand next year.
Finland shares many of Sweden's problems, although the economy there is
bouncing back more vigorously. The country's finance ministry forecasts GDP
growth this year of 3.5 per cent rising to 4.5 per cent in 1995. Independent
commentators have suggested growth could exceed 6 per cent.
The Danish government is expecting growth of 4.4 per cent this year and 3
per cent in 1995. Private consumer spending is surging on the back of tax
cuts and mortgage reductions. But the boom is sucking in imports and cutting
the current account surplus.
The Norwegian economy is benefiting from generally stronger oil prices and
record-high oil production from the North Sea. But even the non-oil economy
is doing well, with predictions suggesting that mainland GDP will rise by 3
per cent this year.

 -Europe (41): Deficit clouds prospects - Italy / Robert Graham on how the
Berlusconi government is tackling problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's huge public sector deficit hangs like a sword of Damocles over every
aspect of economic policy of the five-month-old Berlusconi government.
The way in which the right wing coalition tackles the debt issue, in the
context of a tough 1995 budget and a broader coherent macroeconomic
strategy, will be an important factor in determining the durability of this
new and inexperienced administration.
The stakes are high. If the policies fail to convince the market, this will
inevitably lead to a further weakening of the lira, inflationary pressures
and a punishing rise in interest rates.
This vicious cycle will limit Italy's ability to take advantage of the
domestic economic recovery and the generalised recovery among industrialised
countries.
As it is, the economy is set to grow 1.5 per cent this year and close to 3
per cent in 1995. Exports continue to enjoy an unprecedented boom with the
first-half trade surplus of L16,000bn (Dollars 10bn) double that of the same
period in 1993. Inflation, helped by low wage demands, is down to an
annualised 3.7 per cent, the lowest level since the 1960s.
But all these positive elements are dwarfed by the problems of Italy's
public finances which in turn limit the country's ability to meet the
European Union convergence criteria laid down by the Maastricht treaty.
Unfortunately, too, the Berlusconi government has got off to a bad start,
unnecessarily alienating the markets by giving the wrong signals.
On taking office as premier in May, Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate
turned politician, failed to give sufficient priority to tackling the public
sector deficit.
Instead he appeared more intent on kick-starting the recovery, his first
measures being investment, share purchase and job creation incentives.
At the same time Mr Berlusconi gave far too little attention to the
constraints imposed by the debt, it being close to 125 per cent of GDP -
double the limit set down by the Maastricht convergence criteria.
These failings were compounded by Mr Berlusconi's visceral distaste for
increasing the fiscal pressure after an electoral campaign in which he
promised no new taxes and also pledged a progressive reduction of the tax
burden. This stance on taxation has tied the hands of the new economic team
and complicated their task in finding the large amounts of money necessary
to hold down the 1995 budget deficit to below 9 per cent of GDP.
The government inherited an overshoot in spending and a shortfall in
revenues. This situation was no secret and the outgoing Ciampi
administration had made it clear that a mid-year correction was necessary to
control the 1994 budget rising L15,000bn above initial provisions. However,
Mr Berlusconi has avoided a formal mini-budget.
Instead, the new economic team headed by Lamberto Dini, the treasury
minister and former director-general of the Bank of Italy, chose to raise
the funds through two measures that would also roll over into 1995 - an
amnesty for illicit construction (raising funds through property
registration fees), and a form of tax pardon allowing quick and favourable
settlements to a huge backlog of disputes with the tax authorities. These
practical and politically popular measures are expected to raise some
L6,000bn this year. Next year they are due to bring in at least L15,000bn.
But some economists are concerned that a new government tackling chronic
deficit problems should have resorted at the outset to once-off measures -
measures which also had a history in Italy of generating less revenue than
predicted. The economists also feel that the greater than anticipated 1994
budget deficit (L159,000bn instead L144,000bn) should have been corrected
completely and not partially as has been done.
In all, the government is pledged to find almost L50,000bn in 1995. This is
probably the minimum necessary to convince the markets and it involves
continued austerity budgets through 1996 and 1997. Even so, finding such
funds is a formidable task and the government is relying essentially on
spending cuts and juggling with existing taxes. The full shape of the budget
will not be known until the end of this month and it is not clear how the
painful spending cuts will fall.
Against this uncertain background - and the aggravation of a damaging row
between the government and the Bank of Italy over the latter's autonomy -
the lira has been weak and government bonds have taken a beating. The lira
by the end of July had reached its psychological floor of L1,000 against the
D-Mark and by early August had fallen to a historic low of L1030.
Not surprisingly, the Bank of Italy was obliged to raise on August 11 its
benchmark discount rate by half a percentage point to 7.5 per cent. This was
the first such rise since the September 1992 European currency crisis. Bonds
are now having to be offered at rates as much as 4.5 percentage points above
German interest rates and over the next few months a large stock of bonds
are due to mature.
Analysts reckon, as a rule of thumb, that a 1 percentage point
increase/decrease in interest rates means an additional annual cost/saving
of L15,000bn. In other words, virtually a quarter of the new revenues being
sought in 1995 could be eaten up by a 1 percentage point rise in interest
rates. It also raises the question whether it is realistic to believe the
latest forecast that the total of debt as a proportion of GDP will level off
in 1995 at 128 per cent
The treasury's 1995 document released in July forecast debt service would be
L169,000bn. Since 1992, the size of Italy's annual debt service payments has
exceeded that of the budget deficit. Italy in fact will run a primary
surplus on its budget this year (the difference between revenues and
expenditures less interest charges) equivalent to nearly 1 per cent of GDP.
The primary surplus in 1995 is expected to rise to 1.7 per cent of GDP and
to 2.6 per cent the following year. The 1995 budget itself is predicated on
holding the rise in public spending to 2.5 per cent, the rate of projected
inflation against a planned 2.7 per cent rise in GDP. This means finding
cuts of some L32,000bn.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - The World's Economies
 -Europe (39): An enlightened monetarist - Profile / Hans Tietmeyer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hans Tietmeyer started off living up handsomely to the consensus
characterisation in the welter of profiles which marked his installation as
Bundesbank president last October.
Circumstances quickly conspired either to encourage or oblige him to
demonstrate both the stubbornness attributed to him by colleagues, and the
application of enlightened, pragmatic monetarism on which he prides himself.
He has also had occasion to show his temper.
Within three weeks of his taking the chair of the central bank's policy
council, a surprise cut in the Bundesbank's internationally-sensitive
discount rate earned the bank rare praise from foreign authorities which had
been pressing - without much optimism - for action.
While announcing the opportunistic move, Mr Tietmeyer used the press
conference effectively to define his attitude to the job. What emerged was
that no matter how enlightened he might be, he was still a monetarist in the
old Bundesbank mould. One perceptive observer had forecast earlier that the
world could expect more pragmatism from the new president but 'the same
amount of monetarism' as his dry predecessor, Helmut Schlesinger.
Even while Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, was congratulating the
Frankfurt authorities on the rate cut's contribution to international
economic recovery and job creation, Mr Tietmeyer was insisting that central
bank policy was not driven by external requirements, economic conditions or
exchange rate considerations.
Then, on a theme he had consistently voiced in the past, and was to return
to and expand on frequently in the subsequent months, he added: 'We cannot
be a central bank for Europe.'
He seemed concerned to dispel any expectations, fuelled by the
profile-writers' focus on his sensitivity to international matters, that his
fundamental approach to monetary policy would be influenced by any interests
other than those of Germany.
His streak of stubbornness and temper have appeared more recently, during
bouts of financial market turbulence caused not least by the confusion over
the bank's eccentric M3 measure of money supply. Demands from analysts and a
usually compliant domestic press corps that the bank should either clearly
explain the whirligig gyrations of its inflation weather vane or scrap it,
have met a stonewall defence. After some confusion in Bundesbank ranks over
how to restore faith, Mr Tietmeyer, flanked mainly by directorate colleague
Otmar Issing, set about trying to patch up the damage in a series of
carefully orchestrated speeches.
Mr Tietmeyer's stance became clear at a heavily-attended social gathering of
international bankers in Frankfurt in mid-June, during which he suggested
obliquely that fellow council members should shut up on the issue.
Difficulties with M3 needed to be explained and clarified, he said, and it
would be better done in 'symphonic rather than cacophonic' form.
A speech from Alexandre Lamfalussy, president of the European Monetary
Institute, obligingly supported the Bundesbank standpoint: 'Money supply
does matter for the medium- to long-term behaviour of prices,' he said, and
left the microphone to Mr Tietmeyer.
There were many reasons why the Bundesbank had relied on monetary targeting
as a policy anchor for 20 years, and as far as he was concerned, there were
no grounds for the central council to call it into question now, Mr
Tietmeyer said. He followed up with a deft review of how the merits of
monetary targeting outweighed its demerits, and a side-swipe at the
'not-very-enticing' and opaque alternatives practised in the Anglo-Saxon
world.
Despite appearances, the Bundesbank was far from fixated on M3, he said.
Even in Frankfurt, the conduct of monetary policy allowed room for
intuition, flexibility and pragmatism.
But in an especially revealing passage he effectively admitted he had
learned hard lessons from recent events. He noted wrily that even a missed
money supply target had some value. As the 'financial markets seismograph'
had shown, it should act as a warning not to push pragmatism too far.
Mr Tietmeyer had formerly taken some pride in the fact that, unlike his two
predecessors, he had never rattled foreign exchange markets through careless
talk about the D-Mark. He still refuses steadfastly to comment on exchange
rate swings. But during May and June he found himself confronted by wider
turmoil in world financial markets to which actions and statements from the
German central bank had contributed to no mean extent.
The bank's credibility - by his own admission its most valuable asset -
suffered as a consequence, and by association, so did President Tietmeyer's.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - The World's Economies
 -Europe (40): Faster start than expected - France / The recovery appears to
be gathering pace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French economy has left the starting blocks faster than expected as it
heads for recovery after the sharp recession of 1992-1993. Growth of 1 per
cent in the second quarter, following a rise of 0.7 per cent in the first
three months, has prompted most private sector economists to predict an
expansion of about 2 per cent in gross domestic product this year, a target
endorsed by the government.
Such a growth rate may this year bring only a marginal dent in the ranks of
the country's 3.3m unemployed. But government officials argue that it
provides the basis for a steady longer-term recovery. Edmond Alphandery, the
economics minister, believes growth next year will be at least 3 per cent
and that such a rate of expansion is sustainable over the medium term.
The rate of revival undermines the claims of those who argued during last
year's currency crisis that France's anti-inflationary stance and its
allegiance to the Bundesbank's monetary policy would prevent economic
revival. But while inflation appears firmly under control, with consumer
prices growing at an annualised rate of about 1.7 per cent, some question
marks remain about the stamina of the recovery and about the government's
ability to tackle the structural problems facing the French economy.
Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, has himself warned about bumps on the
road to restored economic health. 'This is the beginning of a real recovery.
But it may be that in the months ahead we have some disappointments . . .
whether it is production, export or employment figures,' he said in August.
So far, economic revival has been largely powered by the corporate sector
and by sporadic specific bursts in consumer spending. French industry has
sharply reduced its rate of destocking, particularly in the intermediate
goods sector, providing a boost to growth figures. In the first quarter this
re-stocking represented the most important source of growth, maintaining its
effect into the second quarter.
French industry has also benefited from improved demand in international
markets. Stronger growth in Germany, France's most important trading
partner, has added to the boost to exporters from the dynamic US and east
Asian markets, prompting a series of substantial trade surpluses. The
surpluses, which amounted to FFr7.6bn in May, for example, are expected to
narrow as imports revive in line with the economy.
If the corporate sector has provided the basis for recovery, however, the
key questions facing policy makers relate to whether consumption and
investment will be able to take up the running and keep the economic cycle
turning.
France's consumers have yet to prove that they are willing to play their
part in a sustained economic revival. Spending in the second quarter was
robust, but this partly reflected special incentives - notably a strong
boost to car purchases stemming from a government offer to provide FFr5,000
to those who traded in an old vehicle to buy a new one. That effect started
to wear off towards the end of the quarter and consumer spending has
remained fragile.
Many economists believe that such fragility is just a passing phase, to be
ended by the improving labour market situation. Recent statistics
demonstrate a stabilisation in the unemployment rate and hold the promise of
a fall in joblessness from the end of the year. 'We are already seeing a big
increase in jobs created,' says Bernard Godement, chief economist of Nomura
Research Institute in Paris. 'There will be an important psychological
effect on consumers.'
Others, however, are yet to be convinced. Esther Baroudy, senior economist
at Credit Lyonnais, questions the quality of jobs being created and cites
structural factors, such as reduced payments from the creaking state pension
scheme, as important determinants of consumer behaviour.
Investment is another area of uncertainty. 'The corporate sector has a
strong financial position, and many firms reported big gains in turnover in
the first half,' says one economist at a US merchant bank. 'Set against this
are still high levels of capacity and interest rates that make financial
investment attractive.'
Most economists expect investment to strengthen from the third quarter of
this year and many companies, such as Saint Gobain, the glass and building
materials group, are already planning new investment programmes. But the
strength and breadth of an investment recovery will depend on demand,
particularly from consumers.
Should any of these sources of growth falter, the government has relatively
limited room for manoeuvre. A central budget deficit targeted at FFr300bn
this year and FFr275bn in 1995, the convergence requirements of European
monetary union, and the potential pressure on long-term borrowing rates,
already pushed up to more than seven per cent by the turmoil on the bond
markets, leave little scope for fiscal stimulus.
With respect to monetary policy, the newly independent Bank of France has
been gradually trimming short-term interest rates. The intervention rate,
the floor for money market rates, has been reduced to 5 per cent from 6.2
per cent at the beginning of the year.
The strong performance of the German economy and the rise in interest rates
in other industrialised nations suggests, however, it will be hard to ease
borrowing costs further. With inflation moribund, the real cost of borrowing
will remain higher than in most of France's rivals.
Increased importance is therefore placed on the government's ability to
implement structural reforms, notably in the labour market and in the social
security system. Mr Balladur's instincts are in the direction of reform, but
progress has been limited by political sensitivities. The introduction of
private pension schemes, aimed at easing the burden on the state system, has
been delayed, while a plan to lower the minimum wage for graduate
apprentices was abandoned in the face of student protests.
Such caution largely reflects Mr Balladur's reluctance to rock the boat
ahead of next spring's presidential elections. Failure to press ahead with
reforms after the election, however, will mean that the emerging recovery
will only serve to mask the structural weaknesses which persist in the
economy.

 -Europe (38): Mighty leap out of recession - Germany / Critics have been
caught offguard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Critics who accuse the German economy of leaning too heavily on the rickety
crutch of out-dated industries have once again been caught off guard by its
spring-heeled leap out of the 1993 recession.
Gross domestic product in the second quarter in former West Germany grew a
real 1 per cent from the first three months, and was 2.3 per cent ahead of
the second quarter of 1993.
The east, home to 20 per cent of the population but which still contributes
less than 10 per cent of GDP, also staged a better-than-expected surge of
almost 9 per cent growth, bringing the unadjusted aggregate for all Germany
to 2.8 per cent.
Not bad for a country which, in the words of Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank
president, some people consider is 'on the way out, technologically
backward, administratively hide-bound, and over-taxed by the task of
building up the new federal states.
'For them, the German economic and social system is a discontinued model,'
he said recently.
While notionally addressing the great and the good during September's
ceremonial farewells to the western allies in Berlin, Mr Tietmeyer was in
effect reminding Germany that there is still a long way to go if the
Jeremiahs are to be proved wrong.
He was repeating a well-worn script to the effect that while the cyclical
upswing, led almost entirely by exports and construction, was welcome,
structural change was still needed if the next cyclical slump was not to be
even more steep and shocking than the last when growth of 1.8 per cent in
1992 was turned into contraction of 1.7 per cent in 1993.
Although Mr Tietmeyer said he disapproved of 'blanket judgments' such as the
one he cited, new challenges demanded far-reaching corrections over the next
few years, above all in the economic field. Hide-bound structures had to be
remedied.
Demands on pay and the social system had to reflect changes in 'the real
economic world. Germany had to free itself from the 'tyranny of the status
quo'.
Some of these issues were addressed in the latest report on Germany from the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Unavoidably,
the report dwelt on the financial and fiscal burdens imposed by unification.
Sure, the eastern economy expanded 7 per cent last year, and is heading for
9 per cent this time, according to the OECD.
But this progress had been made possible only via annual hand-outs of some
DM130bn - equivalent to almost 50 per cent of the east's GDP and 4.6 per
cent of west Germany's economic output.
But there was more. As the report's authors pointed out, the annual
transfers to the east were almost exactly matched by subsidies to ageing
western industries, equivalent to a further 5 per cent of GDP.
Thanks to such burdens - neither of which is likely to be lightened
significantly in the foreseeable future - German taxation is the highest in
the industrial world after that of France.
Last year's government paper on securing Germany's industrial and economic
future called for substantial tax reforms, and named cuts in industrial
subsidies as a key step towards fiscal consolidation. Also included, as the
OECD so pointedly reminded the Bonn government, were contentious issues such
as restrictive shop opening hours, state-ownership and a less-than-optimal
environment for innovative industries: all of which unnecessarily restrained
economic growth.
If government could get to grips with and push through its catalogue of
projects, 'the German model of a social economy could win back its old
strengths', the report said.
Bonn's privatisation and deregulation plans are being laid and put partly
into action. Most recently the government modestly diluted its holding in
the Lufthansa airline. Timetables have been drafted for the sale of stakes
in Deutsche Telekom and the postal service. A bargain was recently struck
allowing private competition into the distribution of mass mailings of items
such as mail order catalogues and advertising brochures.
But deregulation and privatisation are, as yet, considered matters for
concerted action only within the federal government, which controls only
part of the nation's assets. Far more extensive holdings remain in the hands
of local and regional Lander governments, including most of the country's
airports, vast tracts of forest and agricultural land. Even the country's
largest automotive group, Volkswagen, is controlled by the government of
Lower Saxony - a Social Democrat stronghold with no intention of releasing
its grip.
The path to deregulation in Germany is littered with obstacles. The
devolution of decision-making - and tax-raising - powers within the federal
structure is a significant hurdle. The concept of Mitbestimmung or
co-determination which is deeply ingrained in the national mentality,
routinely reduces decision-making to a snail's pace. But the debate is
getting under way.
Although discussion of taxation and fiscal consolidation has been halted and
blurred by election campaigns for most of this year, it will return as a
central theme when the new federal government confronts its most important
medium-term political challenge: European monetary union.
As the country which prides itself as the main driving force behind the
European Union, it faces an uncomfortable situation next year when the ratio
of public sector debt will exceed the Maastricht treaty criterion of 60 per
cent of GDP. Even worse, an independent council of government advisers has
recently warned finance minister Theo Waigel that getting back below the 60
per cent level will at best be difficult in the following years.
The experts have calculated that meeting the debt ratio guideline requires
the fulfilment of a second Maastricht point - that government deficits
should not exceed 3 per cent of GDP - and long-term nominal annual growth of
5 per cent. The snag is that economic growth at this rate implies annual
inflation of 3 per cent, which is incompatible with the Bundesbank's
insistence - not to say hide-bound attitude - that inflation may not exceed
2 per cent if its statutory obligation to maintain a stable D-Mark is to be
fulfilled.

<TEXT>
Establishing liberal capitalism in eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union has turned out to be more difficult than many forecast. The European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development was set up in 1991 as a central part
of western governments' efforts to assist in that task.
Jacques de Larosiere took over at the helm of the EBRD slightly less than a
year ago at a difficult time for the bank and for the countries it is
designed to serve.
The EBRD's eventual contribution to the economic rebuilding of the former
communist bloc may turn out to be less impressive than expected. However,
under Mr de Larosiere's stewardship, the bank is unquestionably in a more
solid position to tackle the task than in autumn 1993.
The former managing director of the International Monetary Fund and governor
of the Bank of France took over after the previous president, Jacques
Attali, resigned following revelations of over-spending and mismanagement at
the bank. Mr de Larosiere's first priority was to restore confidence among
EBRD staff and shareholders that the bank could make a real contribution in
spurring economic development in former communist countries. He has
refocused the bank's energies squarely and decisively towards that goal.
Mr de Larosiere is an unassuming man who lacks Mr Attali's visionary
qualities but - partly because of that - commands rare respect on the
international monetary circuit. He has a reputation for cool-headedness.
During his last weeks at the Bank of France, Mr de Larosiere was on the
front line during the foreign exchange crisis at the end of July 1993 when
the French franc came under heavy pressure against the D-Mark.
During negotiations with the German government, he effectively took over the
leadership of the French delegation, according to those present during the
talks, virtually eclipsing Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister.
At the EBRD, Mr de Larosiere has displayed similar strength of purpose.
During his first few months, he quickly concluded that the bank, with 56
mainly government shareholders and Ecu10bn (Dollars 12bn) in equity capital,
had become too bureaucratic and disorganised to carry out its mandate.
As a consequence, he has carried out a quiet revolution, streamlining staff,
cutting increases in personnel and administrative costs and raising the
number of banking professionals working directly on projects.
The EBRD president led the drive for more cost-effectiveness, freezing
salaries for himself and senior employees and closing down the EBRD's
executive dining rooms.
Mr Attali's relationship with the bank's 23-member London-based board was
frequently adversarial. Mr de Larosiere, by contrast, is the epitome of
sobriety. Mr Attali used in turn to hector the board and ignore it,
occasionally reading newspapers during meetings to show his disdain for the
proceedings.
Mr de Larosiere, by contrast, surprised other board members during his first
meetings by taking notes of what was said. Mr de Larosiere also abolished
the merchant and development banking departments which previously handled
separately private and public sector projects.
Although some of the boundaries between the bank's new 'north' and 'south'
geographical departments looked a little arbitrary, the aim was to gear the
EBRD's activities more closely to the needs of the 25 countries in which it
operates.
Aided by Ron Freeman, the senior vice-president and No 2 at the bank, Mr de
Larosiere has led the drive to increase the EBRD's effectiveness by raising
the number of investment instruments at its disposal. He wants the EBRD to
widen its reach by taking more stakes in banks and investment funds in
eastern countries. He also favours the EBRD stepping up its indirect lending
through guarantees to back private sector project loans.
The EBRD statutes call for the bank's loans and equity investments to be
split 60/40 between the private and public sectors. In some former Soviet
republics viable private sector projects are hard to find.
But Mr de Larosiere has pledged to maintain the bank's priority leaning
towards the private sector, and has brought in a number of young bankers who
will work in the field in the EBRD's countries of operation, leading the
search for new projects.
Countries such as the US and Germany among the EBRD's larger government
shareholders have declared themselves pleased with the new approach and
direction. However, some countries - led by the UK - claim that the bank
could go further in slimming its operations by cutting back the size of the
board, which accounts for 12 per cent of the EBRD's costs.
Mr de Larosiere has succeeded in putting the bank back on an even keel. As a
slow and patchy economic recovery gains ground in the east, the EBRD will be
able to reap the benefits of improving fortunes among its clients. In some
countries, however, economic recovery may throw fresh question marks over
the bank's raison d'etre. If economic structures and performance in the west
of the former Soviet empire become increasingly aligned to those in the rest
of Europe, the justification for a large public sector bank to nurture these
countries' economies will look more questionable.

 -Europe (37): Sceptics forced to think again - Lionel Barber discusses the
future of the European Monetary Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
What a difference a year makes. The collapse of the exchange rate mechanism,
12 months ago, looked like vindicating criticism of Europe's plans for a
monetary union. But in the interim, the sceptics have been forced to think
again.
The cause of the reassessment is twofold: an incipient recovery bolstered by
a steady reduction in German interest rates; and the commitment of member
states (notably France) to maintaining exchange rate stability rather than
resorting to competitive devaluations to kick-start growth and reverse
rising unemployment.
Suddenly, John Major's remark that talk of a monetary union had all the
quaintness of a rain dance looks somewhat short-sighted. A shrewder judgment
on the implosion of the ERM on August 2, 1993, would more likely echo
General De Gaulle's comments on June 18, 1940: Europe has lost a battle not
the war.
Relative calm in the European currency markets since August 1993 suggests
that the new 15 per cent fluctuation bands are working. The 'dirty float'
has offered a respite from the speculators who revelled in testing the
willingness of the central banks to defend the former narrow fluctuation
bands of 6 per cent and 2.25 per cent respectively.
Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, leads a consensus among his central
bank colleagues in favour of a system which no longer imposes an obligation
on the strong to intervene to prop up weaker currencies. The accent now is
on each member state taking the necessary corrective action - reducing
budget deficits and keeping control of inflation - to bring economies into
line.
This path to economic virtue holds good whether or not member states are
serious about EMU. All the signs, however, suggest that they are. The
creation of the European Monetary Institute is a signal of the political
will to continue on the road to EMU. The caveat is that the Bundesbank's
argument that currency stability is more important than rigid adherence to
the Maastricht treaty's timetable for monetary union clearly holds sway.
So what comes next? First, the EU's road map to a single currency by the end
of the decade may need rethinking. Maastricht's concept of using the
discipline of narrow fluctuation bands to move progressively to fixed
exchange rates looks questionable.
Second, it is worth looking at the margin for manoeuvre offered within the
treaty itself, notably the criteria laid down for membership of a future
monetary union. These fall into three groups: for inflation and interest
rates; for exchange rates; and for fiscal policy.
Consumer price inflation must be within 1 1/2 points of the average of the
best three members. Long-term interest rates must be within 2 per cent of
the average bond yield in the three countries with the lowest inflation
rate.
On exchange rates, member states must respect 'normal' margins of
fluctuation within the ERM for at least two years 'without severe tensions'.
On fiscal policy, the treaty offers two 'reference values': 3 per cent for
the ratio of the planned or actual government deficit to gross domestic
product at market prices; and 60 per cent for the ratio of government debt
to gross domestic product at market prices.
It has suited EMU sceptics to stress the near insuperable nature of the
criteria, particularly those relating to public deficits. EMU supporters
have also had a vested interest in promoting their importance. To do less
would be to encourage backsliding and unnerve the Germans who have most to
lose by surrendering the D-Mark.
Yet EMU may not be quite as elusive as was first imagined. The inflation
target looks eminently manageable for the majority of EU members, and the
interest rate criterion is by no means onerous. It is quite conceivable,
too, that finance ministers could elect to call the wider ERM bands 'normal'
later this year.
The trickiest obstacle remains fiscal deficits. But here again the
Maastricht treaty provides for a degree of political judgment.
Responsibility for applying the 'excessive deficit' procedure lies with the
European Commission which is required to identify 'gross errors'. Also, the
ratio of public debt to GDP must decline 'substantially and continually' and
come close to the reference values.
On the other hand, member states have the chance to argue that their deficit
is temporary or exceptional, and that they are moving toward the reference
values. Thus, on government debt, the reference value is 60 per cent 'unless
the ratio is sufficiently diminishing and approaching the reference value at
a satisfactory pace'.
This year, the Commission has already argued that Ireland does not fail the
fiscal test, despite its high debt, because of its low deficit. The move
offered an important signal about future flexibility, assuming the Council
of Ministers agrees (it must act by a qualified majority on the
recommendation of the Commission).
It is tempting to conclude that EMU is eminently feasible, with the outcome
depending on the political will of those member states with the strongest
commitment to European integration. The refusal of the Belgians and the
French to break ranks with their partners on interest rates suggests that
the governing elite's support for EMU remains undiminished. Together with
Germany, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, Belgium and France look very much
like an informal hard currency club.
Yet it would be unwise to ignore the statements from leading Germans,
notably Mr Tietmeyer, that EMU needs to be balanced by a greater degree of
political union in Europe. The precise nature of such a political union
remains unclear, but the thrust of the argument holds: Germany remains
hesitant about surrendering monetary sovereignty unless its partners are
prepared to pool sovereignty in other areas.
EMU supporters argue that the Germans have entered legal obligations, so it
is too late to draw back now. But it seems inevitable that the future debate
on EMU will increasingly be coloured by political arguments, with German
calls for greater powers to the European parliament, deeper co-operation on
foreign and defence policy, and a more forthcoming approach to eastern
European neighbours in joining the EU high on the agenda. The final argument
on which countries are deemed eligible to join EMU is also expected to be
controversial.
The lesson of the past 12 months is that the EU retains an enviable ability
to improvise in the face of obstacles or setbacks.

analyses results of the Cairo conference

Alarm and hope: those are governments' twin reactions to the latest batch of
projections from the United Nations on how many people will be occupying the
planet in the next century. One message behind the figures is that high
population growth in developing countries remains a threat to their
prosperity, and through migration, to that of developed countries as well.
But other messages are that growing populations need not represent the
apocalypse which has been predicted by many, and that there is much
governments can do to slow down the increase.
This month's UN conference on population and development in Cairo, the first
to tackle the contentious subject for a decade, stirred up controversy on
many fronts. The Vatican formally registered its reservations to nearly half
the chapters in the final text, on the grounds that it condoned abortion as
a form of contraception. The UN Population Fund (UNFPA), which organised the
conference, denied that the text had that interpretation, but several
Catholic countries in Latin America also lodged reservations to sections.
However, despite an informal alliance between the Vatican and Moslem
governments in the run-up to Cairo, governments achieved a much greater
degree of agreement at Cairo on responses to the threat of population growth
than seemed possible at the previous UN conferences in 1984 or 1974. The
final document set a target for annual spending on family planning of
Dollars 17bn a year by 2000, from national programmes and international aid,
which marks a threefold increase on present levels.
Most governments acknowledged at Cairo that it is in their own interest to
take steps to help people limit the sizes of their families, given the
formidable projections of the world's population. According to the UNFPA's
annual report, published in August, the total is set to reach a sobering
10bn by the middle of the next century, up from 5.7bn at present.
The UNFPA's projection assumes that the average number of children born to
each woman will continue to fall, as it has done for several decades; other
assumptions, only slightly different, produce estimates of the total number
of people in 2050 between 7.8bn and 12.5bn.
These increases will put increasing strains on natural resources of all
kinds, both global resources, such as the atmosphere and seas, and regional.
Water, in particular, may prove 'an increasing cause of friction' between
countries and regions, the UNFPA suggests.
The implications of these projections for the distribution of wealth between
countries and continents are also considerable. The World Bank estimates, in
a report released ahead of Cairo, that 61 per cent of the world's population
will live in countries with per capita incomes of below Dollars 350 a year
(in 1990 money values). That compares with 57 per cent in 1985. Over the
same period, the proportion of people living in countries with per capita
incomes over Dollars 19,590 will fall from 16 per cent to 11 per cent.
Moreover, the bank warns that by 2100, 10 out of 11 people will live in the
developing world, compared to four out of five at present, and two out of
three in 1950. Much of the increase will come in Africa: the present annual
growth in the continent's population of 2.9 per cent a year is the highest
in the world. That rate outstrips by some way the annual Asian and Latin
American growth of less than 2 per cent, according to the UNFPA.
Within developing countries, people will drift to the cities in search of
jobs, prompted by competition for land and water in rural areas. The World
Bank estimates that in 2025, 57 per cent of the population in developing
countries will live in cities, compared to less than half now.
As a result of those pressures, developed countries should prepare to face
growing pressures for immigration, the bank warns. As their populations are
growing slowly, they should expect their share of the world's population to
shrink. While North America's population is edging up at 1 per cent a year,
the rate is only 0.5 per cent a year in the former Soviet Union and 0.3 per
cent a year in western Europe.
Meanwhile, their populations are ageing: the UNFPA expects the proportion of
people aged 65 and over in industrialised countries to rise from the present
12.7 per cent to 18.4 per cent by 2025.
To set against those threats, UN figures provide some ammunition to counter
fears of a global food shortage, of the kind voiced by the 'Club of Rome'
school of forecasters some 20 years ago. The UNFPA observes that 'during the
past 10 years, the world's food production has increased by 24 per cent,
outpacing the rate of population growth'.
But the improvement in food production has been unevenly distributed, the
UNFPA also points out. In Africa, food production fell by 5 per cent while
population rose by a third. While the UN maintains that food supplies
'should be sufficient to meet all needs for the foreseeable future', the
poorer regions and countries will face severe shortages.
Reason to worry, then; but the past two decades also provide grounds for
hope that governments can help bring down population growth rates. Most
developing countries - even, in the past few years, those in sub-Saharan
Africa - have seen fertility rates fall.
According to UNFPA officials, a decade ago many African countries saw
growing populations as a useful tool to increase prosperity. Now, seeing the
growth jeopardise the fruits of investment in health, education,
infrastructure and agriculture, they are showing a greater readiness to
promote family planning.
The UNFPA says that governments now appreciate that making contraception
more widely available helps bring down fertility rates, even if economic
development has been slow. Demographers' new message is that if people are
given the means to control the number of children they have, even in the
poorest countries they frequently choose to have fewer.
The past decade has shown governments the threat which uncurbed population
growth can pose to prosperity. But it has also helped generate confidence
among governments that growth rates can be tackled, and broad agreement on
ways to do that.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Trade and the World
Economy (35): Clean-up targets hard to hit - Environment / Bronwen Maddox
assesses results after the Rio earth summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Governments have succeeded in solving few of the truly global environmental
threats which face them, although some are getting better at solving
national problems. But countries' records vary widely: the clean ones are
tending to get cleaner, while the dirty ones get filthier.
The Rio Earth Summit two years ago stands as the world's most ambitious
attempt to identify and address global environmental problems. While
governments and lobby groups wrestled with almost every environmental issue
imaginable - with the notable exception of population growth, as the UK's
Prince Charles pointed out - two concerns above all provoked enough alarm to
push delegates to agreement. The Rio climate change convention addresses the
effect of pollution on the world's atmosphere; the biodiversity convention
tackles threats to the worldwide diversity of species.
This year's annual report from the United Nations Environment Programme
notes that the rate of increase of atmospheric concentrations of methane, a
'greenhouse' gas, has been slowing, although concentrations of carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere have continued to grow. But it also makes clear
that emissions of carbon dioxide are rising less quickly than some once
feared. The collapse of highly-polluting heavy industry in eastern Europe
and the former Soviet Union, together with recession in western Europe and
North America, has provided something of a 'breathing space'.
It seems unlikely that eastern European industry will return to its former
levels of pollution, given that new plant now being installed is many times
more energy efficient than the old. However, as recession lifts in western
Europe and North America, those regions' emissions will continue to rise.
That will make the question of their compliance with the Rio targets
pressing once again.
It is too early to judge whether governments have changed their policies in
response to the Rio agreements. But their responses to the climate change
targets are in some disarray. The convention commits industrialised
countries to drawing up plans for bringing emissions of 'greenhouse' gases
such as carbon dioxide back to 1990 levels in 2000. However, higher taxes on
energy, the tool first seized upon by the US and the European Union, have
proved politically unpopular, and measures to introduce them have stalled.
It is even harder to measure government's progress on biodiversity targets
given that knowledge of the number and distribution of species of plants,
animals, insects and fish is incomplete. Indeed, environmental campaigners
use that ignorance as a justification for 'precautionary' action; the rain
forests, they argue, may hold hitherto undiscovered sources of medicines.
But environmental lobby groups such as Worldwide Fund for Nature have been
sceptical that governments' measures to preserve biodiversity will be
vigorous. That stance is given weight by the two dozen disputes in the past
year over fishing rights in international waters, where countries are not
convinced that conservation is in their interest.
There are three reasons why the Rio conventions are proving hard to
implement. First, the science is uncertain: it is hard to determine the
extent of the environmental damage caused by atmospheric pollution or loss
of species. Second, changing behaviour is proving expensive. Third,
governments disagree over who should bear the financial burden of making
those changes.
Developing countries argue that they are not to blame for the threat of
climate change. Although their emissions of greenhouse gases are now rising
fast, they argue that present levels of harmful gases in the atmosphere
should be blamed on Europe, North America and Japan.
If progress on the Rio conventions were the only standard by which the
world's ability to tackle environmental problems were judged, there would be
cause for pessimism. However, other, more limited international pacts to
curb pollution have had more success, where both scientific and
distributional questions have proved easier to answer.
The 1987 Montreal Protocol, an international agreement to phase out
substances which damage the ozone layer of the atmosphere, is one of the
most successful attempts to address an environmental threat. The causes of
the problem were more easily identified than those of global warming, and
companies rapidly developed substitutes for most of the chemicals
incriminated.
Although thinning of the ozone layer, which shields people and crops from
the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays, is continuing, scientists predict that
if the phase-out is completed, the layer will begin to repair itself by the
middle of next century.
Where regional interest is clear, pacts have also been easier to draw up and
implement than the Rio targets. European and North American countries have
succeeded in drawing up progressively tighter curbs on emissions of sulphur
dioxide, which are thought to cause acid rain.
As a result of measures to re-equip power stations, or to derive a higher
proportion of power from gas or nuclear energy, sulphur dioxide emissions in
industrialised countries have been falling sharply. Between 1980 and 1990
they fell by 10 per cent in the US, 29 per cent in Japan, 69 per cent in
western Germany, 60 per cent in Sweden and 23 per cent in the UK, according
to UNEP.
Such efforts have brought sharp improvements in many types of air pollution
in industrialised countries, albeit with the important exception of traffic
fumes. But European and North American countries are also spending
considerable sums on tackling water pollution and the disposal of solid
waste, particularly in its most hazardous forms.
The same picture is not true of many developing countries, where
environmental concerns remain way down governments' priorities - and
capabilities. For example, China's emissions of sulphur dioxide rose by 50
per cent during the 1980s, and India's by 53 per cent. Those trends are
unlikely to change unless governments of developing countries are persuaded
that cleaning up the environment is in their own interest. That can occur
through public pressure, international regulation (and the payments from
developed countries which may accompany it), or simply by acknowledgement of
the costs to the country of losing environmental resources such as trees or
clean air.
Until those changes occur, however, the gap in environmental standards
between developed countries and developing ones which have embarked on
industrialisation is likely to grow wider.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Trade and the World
Economy (31): A cancer in busines - Corruption / Michael Holman on a growing
global phenomenon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN

<TEXT>
Pssst . . . Want to know what it costs to get the government minister on
your side? Or how to broach the delicate subject of whether the president
should be cut in on the deal?
Then buy The Good Business Guide to Bribery*, an insider's guide to what has
been called a cancer which poses a bigger threat to development than Aids.
The cancer is corruption: once seen as a problem associated with tin-pot
dictatorships in far-off countries, it is now increasingly acknowledged to
be a growing global phenomenon, which requires a co-ordinated international
response.
Leading the way is Transparency International (TI), the Berlin-based
'coalition against corruption in international business' and publisher of
the Guide, which argues that at the end of the day, bribery is bad for
business.
Corruption, the TI publication warns, is not a problem confined to the third
world. It is also undermining the fledging democracies of eastern Europe,
threatens clean government in Europe itself, and is ultimately bad for
business.
Its symptoms range from a majestic cathedral in Cote d'Ivoire, built by a
former president who treated state resources as his own, to classrooms
without books in Nigeria, where the education budget has suffered and
businessmen and politicians have benefited from inflated contracts and
diverted oil earnings.
When TI was launched in May last year, it prompted a sceptical response,
summed up by a cartoonist who portrayed the organisation as a contemporary
Don Quixote, tilting at windmills.
But behind Transparency International was a group of hard-headed veterans of
aid, commerce and development, eminent in their own fields, and with
experience spanning the developing world, and with no illusions about the
enormity of their task.
As Peter Eigen, the chairman of TI and a former senior official with the
World Bank, put it: 'We recognise the realities of international commerce
and competition; our approach must be evolutionary.'
But at the same time, he knew that a growing number of businessmen were
increasingly concerned about the spread of corruption and its impact on
business.
Said one executive of a leading international company, with experience in
Africa, Asia and the Caribbean: 'Nobody in the business world pretends any
more that corruption is not one of the most important and damaging factors
in third world development.'
Without a combination of tougher laws, tighter monitoring, and technical
assistance where necessary, the malaise will spread, Mr Eigen and his
colleagues argued at the launch.
These sentiments struck a responsive chord, as Transparency International
began to promote ethical business conduct. It lobbied governments and
leading international companies for support, and above all co-ordinated the
response from leading politicians and concerned citizens around the world to
the call for better business practices and cleaner administrations, and a
crack down on bribery.
'Initially there will be only a few countries where business and government
can jointly subscribe to the concept, a few 'islands of integrity',' says Mr
Eigen.
The campaign initially focused on five or six governments in developing
countries and central and eastern Europe which were prepared to participate
in the programme. Drawing up a code of practice, and providing the expertise
with which to monitor it, and strengthening the institutions that have to
enforce it, takes time.
But the day is not far off when these governments will restrict tendering
for state contracts to corporations which have themselves signed an
anti-bribery pledge as part of the integrity in business programme.
The trailblazer has been Ecuador, where tenders for a Dollars 600m
government-funded pipeline contract will be limited to companies who have
signed a code of business conduct.
'We expect these leading countries will then create a momentum by their
example,' says Mr Eigen.
TI's role includes providing a range of services, such as suggesting ways in
which rules and systems for international procurement bidding can be
improved, assisting governments to establish anti-corruption investigative
agencies, establishing a clearing house for information on corruption, and
examining serious cases of briery.
Anti-corruption drives are not new, TI officials acknowledge. But past
efforts have failed in part, they say, because it was not possible to
co-ordinate a global coalition involving all the main players, as TI now
does.
This has been made possible, says TI, by the new world order that has
emerged over the past few years.
The end of the cold war has meant that governments which used to shelter
under the umbrella of Moscow or Washington, now face exposure, knowing that
their erstwhile patrons will no longer turn a blind eye to economic and
political abuses because of the need for access to a strategic airport,
dockyard or mineral supply.
The wave of democratisation that followed the super power rapprochement,
from central and eastern Europe to Africa and Latin America, has seen the
emergence of representative governments anxious to make a fresh start.
At the same time, the industrialised countries have been shaken out of their
complacency about corruption, as scandals in Italy, Japan and Britain reveal
that they, too, are vulnerable.
Today, much of the drive for an internationally binding code of conduct
comes from the regions that have suffered most, instigated by a new breed of
politicians, lawyers, and businessmen in south America, eastern Europe and
Africa, who know from their own bitter experience just what corruption can
do.
Eighteen months after its launch, TI draws on the support of chapters that
have sprung up around the world - including Bangladesh, Benin, Bolivia,
Australia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Germany, Hungary, Mali, Kenya, New Zealand,
the Phillipines, the UK, and the US.
Word spread through TI's quarterly newsletter, which monitors corruption
around the world, and tells subscribers what is being done to combat it.
In Russia, for example, where TI is in the process of establishing a
chapter, it has been asked by parliament and President Yeltsin's office to
make submissions on the proposed new anti-corruption laws.
Leaders brought together by the Organisation of American States have put
anti-corruption measures high on their agenda for their December summit in
Miami, noting that 'corrupt practices are capable of frustrating the process
of overall development'.
Perhaps the most important breakthrough came barely a year after TI's
launch. In Paris last May the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), made the opening move in what could become an
internationally co-ordinated programme to combat corruption.
The influential 25-country association recommended 'that members take
effective measures to deter, prevent and combat the bribery of foreign
public officials in connection with international business transactions'.
'The OECD move is something we have worked for assiduously', said Mr Eigen.
'Ideally we wanted stronger action than non-binding recommendation.'

Economy (32): Good reasons for optimism - Inflation / Is it a thing of the
past?
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
One good indicator that inflation may not be as dead as people believe is
that so many suppose it is. Apart from this niggling doubt, the picture
looks rather good. It should remain attractive for some time. Yet things
could go wrong. The main risks lie in the domestic policies of the
industrial countries, rather than in outside events, such as rises in
commodity prices.
The latest forecast from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development was that, excluding Turkey, the rise in the deflator for GDP
(the broadest measure of inflation) would be only 2.1 per cent this year,
following 2.6 per cent in 1993 and 3.2 per cent in 1992. Not since the 1960s
has the OECD-wide GDP deflator risen by less than 3 per cent in any year.
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has argued that 'price
stability means that expected changes in the average price level are small
enough and gradual enough that they do not materially enter business and
household decisions'. Given the difficulty of measuring quality
improvements, this level is often taken to be 0-2 per cent.
The advanced industrial countries have virtually achieved that goal. In
fact, the OECD forecasts that in 1994, no fewer than 18 members of the OECD
will have inflation rates of less than 3 per cent. This can be contrasted
even with 1987, the year when inflation was lowest in 1980s. Then the
increase in the OECD-wide GDP deflator (excluding Turkey) was 3.2 per cent,
while only eight countries achieved inflation below 3 per cent.
The return to fairly low inflation after a quarter of a century is a
considerable feat. Not the least of its benefits is that the costs of
lowering inflation need not be suffered once again. This should help ensure
that the next economic expansion is a long one.
There are also good reasons for believing that inflation will remain low.
One of these is the low rate of monetary growth in virtually all OECD
countries, the principal exception being Germany.
Scarred by bad loans in the 1980s, banks seem unprepared to finance any
substantial expansion of credit. Those scars were the final injury inflicted
by the 1970s, when investors had made fortunes from inflation.
It was probably necessary, therefore, to experience a cycle in which
inflation did not bail out borrowers from their mistakes. Maybe the reason
Germany has had higher monetary growth over the past 12 months than any
other member of the group of seven leading industrial countries is that it
did not experience a large-scale inflationary redistribution of income
during the 1970s.
Yet another reason for optimism, many argue, is the emergence of low-cost
competition, particularly in east Asia. This development is, in fact,
similar in its effects to an increase in the rate of domestic productivity
growth. Inflation could still accelerate if domestic nominal costs,
particularly wages, were to rise and the exchange rate were to depreciate
pari passu. Domestic monetary conditions, not the relative prices of
particular commodities will determine those trends.
Perhaps the most fundamental reasons for optimism are intellectual and
political. People no longer believe it is possible to blow economies up like
balloons merely by judicious use of the printing-press pump. Equally, the
political weight of those opposed to inflation - notably actual and imminent
pensioners - is rising, with their numbers. With exchange controls lifted,
it is also easier for investors to protect themselves against inflation and
punish those who threaten them with its resurgence.
For all that, inflation can hardly be regarded as dead. One reason is that
there are plenty of borrowers, including households, who would love to have
some inflationary relief from the debts they accumulated in the 1980s.
Moreover, among those borrowers are governments, all of whom are under
significant fiscal pressure and some of whom - Sweden, Italy and Belgium
being the salient examples - seem to be in close to a critical position.
When debtors are able to determine whether or not their debts are inflated
away, it is sensible to worry about what they will choose to do.
Inflations are always symptoms of distributional struggles. Such struggles
tend to be fiercest when income falls, which is why inflation peaks have
coincided with surges in prices of imported primary commodities,
particularly oil. The resulting deterioration in the external terms of trade
forces a pass-the-parcel process of redistributing the losses. It is
natural, therefore, to ask whether resurgent commodity prices might yet
derail the stately progress of non-inflationary growth.
Commodity prices have, in fact, recovered quite strongly. In the year to
September 1994, the Economist price index for all commodities has risen 37
per cent, for food commodities it has risen 43 per cent and for industrial
raw materials it has risen 31 per cent.
These seem significant increases, but they must be kept in context. In
nominal terms the Economist all-items index of commodity prices is still a
little below where it was in 1988. In real terms - deflated in this case by
the consumer price index of the OECD - the value of the all items Economist
index in June 1994 was 35 per cent below its level of six years before. Over
the same period, the corresponding declines were almost a fifth for the real
price of foodstuffs and almost a half for industrial raw materials.
In the early 1990s, real commodity prices fell to their lowest level of the
20th century. Even adjusted for the quality improvement in manufactures, the
real value of commodities has halved since the mid-1970s and is now lower
than at any time since the 1930s. The question is whether the
still-depressed prices of today are due for a sustained turn-around. This
matters because the relative decline in commodity prices, albeit disastrous
for many commodity-exporting developing countries, greatly assisted the
disinflation in OECD countries during the 1980s and 1990s.
In its 1994 Global Economic Prospects, the World Bank forecast an
improvement in the terms of trade of exporters of fuel, but only at an
annual rate of 1.6 per cent between 1994 and 2000 and of a mere 0.4 per cent
for exporters of non-fuel primary products. This is not much of an
improvement, although it certainly does contrast with deteriorations of 2.2
per cent a year between 1987 and 1993 for exporters of fuel and of 1.8 per
cent a year for exporters of non-fuel primary products.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Trade and the World
Economy (33): Prices swings raise doubts - Oil / Distortions have masked
robust growth in demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The influential role of oil prices in the world economy was vividly
illustrated last February, when the price of the benchmark Brent Blend fell
to a five-year low of about Dollars 13 a barrel.
In the US, the world's largest energy market, low crude oil prices were
quickly passed on to industry and consumers in the form of lower petrol and
diesel prices, thus helping to ensure that the rapid economic expansion
steamed ahead without inflationary worries.
But the economic effect of oil prices falling to their lowest real level
since 1973 was markedly different in many petroleum exporting countries.
They were forced to make sharp cuts in public expenditure as export revenues
plummetted.
At the same time some analysts predicted that oil prices could collapse to
single digits, a prospect that prompted speculation about possible civil
unrest in populous but poor members of the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, such as Nigeria and Iran.
Those price forecasts have since been proved wrong. Prices moved steadily
upwards, to reach a high for the year so far of about Dollars 19.40 a barrel
in early August, as the market reacted to fears that supplies from Nigeria
would be cut due to a politically-motivated strike.
But even a four-month price rally was not enough to bring Opec revenues back
to last year's levels. At the end of August the cumulative revenues of the
organisation's members were still about Dollars 15bn, or 18 per cent lower
than those recorded to the end of August 1993, according to the Petroleum
Finance Company, a consultancy based in Washington DC
The collapse of the Nigerian strike in early September caused prices to fall
back to their present level of Dollars 16-Dollars 17 a barrel. But
volatility on the scale seen this year has left oil producers and consumers
alike wondering about the direction of long-term price trends.
The conventional view is that both medium and long-term prices should
gradually increase as demand strengthens in line with economic recovery in
the main industrialised countries.
Although world oil demand fell by about 0.8 per cent in 1993, Peter Davies,
British Petroleum's chief economist, says the figure was distorted by the
unprecedented collapse of demand in the former Soviet Union, where
consumption fell by about a fifth. Oil demand in the rest of the world grew
by about 1.4 per cent, a 'robust' rate according to Mr Davies.
Most forecasts suggest that demand outside the former Soviet Union will
continue to rise. The Paris-based International Energy Agency says oil
demand in the industrialised countries of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development could increase to 45m barrels a day by 2010.
That represents an 18 per cent increase over 1991, but an annual growth rate
of just 0.8 per cent a year
Oil demand in the rest of the world, however, is expected to grow on average
by nearly 4 per cent a year. Growth will be especially buoyant in
fast-growing Asian economies, such as China, which BP economists expect will
overtake Russia some time this year as the world's second largest energy
market.
China has also become a net oil importer. That is a significant development
for future oil prices, given forecasts which show China importing more than
1m barrels a day by 2000.
The prospect of steady, strong demand for oil comes at a time of high
capacity utilisation among leading producers. World oil consumption is
running at about 65m barrels a day, but there is probably only about 2m-3m
b/d of surplus capacity, mostly in the big Opec producers of Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.
The lack of surplus capacity is one of the main reasons why Opec's
notoriously weak commitment to national production quotas has been
maintained this year. It also explains why world markets drove oil prices to
year-to-date highs in August when traders feared that strikes would stop
1.6m b/d of Nigerian exports from reaching international consumers.
Supply worries should help to underpin prices in the short term, as long as
Opec maintains reasonably strong production discipline and there is no early
return to the world markets of Iraqi crude oil, subject to a United Nations
embargo.
Saudi Arabia, the largest exporter, is keen to see prices move closer to the
Dollars 18-Dollars 22 a barrel level. That, Saudi officials say, would be a
high enough price range to satisfy Opec's need for greater oil revenues, but
low enough to avoid inflationary pressures in the industrialised world.
Such a range would also be in keeping with Saudi Arabia's long-term strategy
to keep oil competitive against alternative fuels. Such stable pricing
policies, however, are likely to draw opposition from more populous Opec
price hawks, such as Iran.
But although the world's dependence on Opec will grow towards the end of the
decade, there are a number of short-to-medium-term factors which could keep
oil prices in a relatively steady price range.
The end of the cold war and a wave of privatisations in many developing
countries have opened up an unprecedented number of opportunities for oil
companies, with oil-producing countries increasingly competing for foreign
investment and access to western technology.
Although many companies have experienced political problems in promising
areas such as Russia and other republics of the former Soviet Union, a
steady stream of new, large export-oriented fields in non-Opec countries is
expected to be developed in coming years.
The surge in non-Opec production will eventually tail off. But oil companies
are proving to be particularly adept at developing new technology to extend
the productive life of existing reservoirs well beyond original estimates.
Some analysts believe such technological and market forces are strong enough
to keep prices within a relatively low band of Dollars 15-Dollars 20 a
barrel in real terms. But the growing importance of paper markets in setting
prices means that price swings could still be sudden and wide.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Trade and the World
Economy (30): A test of resolve - Trade / Guy de Jonquieres on the Morocco
agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When almost 120 governments signed the Uruguay Round agreement in Marrakesh,
Morocco, in April, they committed themselves to the most sweeping world
trade liberalisation in history. Now, the strength of their good intentions
is to be put to the test.
Their first task is to ratify the round in time to implement it on schedule
early next year, and simultaneously to establish the new World Trade
Organisation, the grander successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.
The biggest doubts about the timetable have long centred on the US Congress.
After months of wrangling and partisan strife ahead of November's
congressional elections, prospects for swift ratification have recently
brightened.
President Clinton has, however, been forced to pay a heavy price by dropping
his simultaneous request for 'fast track' authority for new trade
agreements. Without such authority, the administration will find it much
harder to negotiate planned free-trade deals with other countries, notably
in Latin America.
There are also uncertainties about the fate of the Uruguay Round in the
European Union, where ratification has become entangled in a jurisidictional
dispute between the Council of Ministers and the Brussels Commission, and in
Japan, where continuing political upheavals have disrupted the parliamentary
calendar.
These difficulties have not, however, deterred Gatt members from pressing
ahead with plans to set up the WTO in January and to select its first
leader.
The WTO will enjoy a number of advantages over the Gatt, which has operated
on a 'provisional' basis since it was formed in 1947. They include a formal
legal structure, stronger mechanisms for settling international trade
disputes and a much wider remit, spanning sectors such as agriculture,
services and intellectual property rights.
The WTO is intended to develop into a permanent negotiating forum, which
will replace omnibus trade rounds, and to play a prominent role alongside
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in fostering global
economic co-ordination.
But realising these ambitions will place heavy demands on the cohesion and
sense of purpose of the WTO and its members, at a time when rapidly
accelerating changes in the world economy are creating many new tensions.
The new WTO head is expected to play a crucial role in providing the
direction and leadership needed to keep the multilateral trade system moving
forward. Among the challenges ahead are:
Holding governments to their Uruguay Round pledges to liberalise
long-protected and politically sensitive sectors such as agriculture and
textiles.
Formulating new rules for trade in services and foreign investment, both
largely uncharted policy areas which involve delicate issues of sovereignty.
Coping with pressures, notably from the US, to involve the WTO in
politically contentious matters such as the links between trade, labour
standards and environmental policy.
Admitting about 20 further countries, including China and members of the
former Soviet Union.
These tasks have to be tackled against a background of confusing - and
sometimes conflicting - international economic trends.
The past decade has witnessed dramatic advances in global interdependence,
as national borders have crumbled under the impact of past trade
liberalisation, enhanced capital mobility and technological advances,
particularly in communications.
These trends have helped to stimulate rapid economic and exports growth in
much of the developing world, notably in Asia, steadily shifting the centre
of gravity of the world economy and international trade away from the
industrialised powers.
At the same time, however, intensified global competition threatens to
provoke negative reactions within countries, as governments come under
pressure to shelter vulnerable domestic constituencies from painful
adjustment to forces outside their control.
So far, the temptation to respond by erecting higher trade barriers across
the board has been resisted. In the US, it has been deflected into
aggressively unilateralist trade initiatives - notably towards Japan - and
more activist industrial and export promotion policies.
In the EU, the worst fears of a 'Fortress Europe' have not materialised. But
EU attitudes remain delicately balanced between the protectionist
inclinations of southern members, led by France, and the traditionally more
liberal northern countries. Furthermore, the EU is seen by many trading
partners as suffering from a myopic preoccupation with internal problems,
which has inhibited it from addressing decisively new global economic
opportunities and challenges.
Cutting across these trends, in both developing and industrialised
countries, is a proliferation of bilateral and sometimes overlapping
regional economic arrangements, exemplified by the North American Free Trade
Area, the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum, and the Latin American
Mercosur grouping.
These groupings are impelled by a variety of motives. As well as improving
access to export markets, these include the desire to 'lock in' domestic
economic reforms, efforts to forge regional solidarity, the quest for
increased influence over international economic policy and the simple fear
of being left out.
The stampede towards regional link-ups seems curiously at odds with the
accelerating pace of global economic integration and the strengthened
multilateral disciplines in the Uruguay Round.
However, advocates of regional blocs often argue that, rather than
fragmenting the world trading system they contribute to its long-term
development by promoting liberalisation between their members.
So far, regional trading arrangements do not appear to have led to higher
barriers against non-members. But the evidence is less clear on how far they
have stimulated increased trade flows or merely diverted existing ones.
A possibly greater threat could be posed to the integrity of the
multilateral system if members of bigger regional blocs use their collective
weight to try to pressure other countries into accepting their own rules and
regulations in return for improved market access.
That risk, however, is only likely to materialise if negotiations within
regional blocs prove a more effective way of achieving consensus on
liberalisation than is available through the WTO.
Nonetheless, persuading governments to treat regional trade deals as
building blocks towards - rather than alternatives to - truly global
liberalisation is likely to pose one of the stiffest tests of the WTO's
ability to establish its authority.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Trade and the World
Economy (29): World Trade Organisation leadership
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The three offical candidates for leadership of the new World Trade
Organisation, the grander and more powerful body which is due to succeed the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade at the beginning of next year.
They are: Carlos Salinas, president of Mexico; Renato Ruggiero, a former
Italian trade minister; and Kim Chul-su, South Korea's trade minister. A
decision is expected in late autumn on who should fill the post.
However, establishment of the WTO - and the starting date for implementing
the Uruguay Round - may have to be delayed if leading economic powers,
including the US, the EU and Japan, have not ratified the agreement by the
end of this year.
Unlike the Gatt, the WTO will be a formal legal entity, with stronger powers
to settle trade disputes and a wider remit, covering areas such as
agriculture, textiles and trade in services. However, it also faces many
challenges.
As well as holding countries to their Uruguay Round commitments, it must
seek to draft global rules in many new areas, at a time when accelerating
changes and tensions in the structure of the global economy are testing
consensus between Gatt members.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Industry (27): The
harsh effects of peace - Defence / Bernard Gray looks at the global squeeze
on military budgets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While it lasted the cold war was certainly a boon for the world's arms
makers. By the mid-1980s, some 85 per cent of all arms purchases were made
by members of Nato or the Warsaw Pact. Small wonder then that the ending of
the biggest armed confrontation in history has had a dramatic impact on the
arms industry world-wide.
Since the fall of the Berlin wall the pressure for a 'peace dividend'
reduction in arms spending, combined with economic hardship in the west and
the former Soviet Union have put a heavy squeeze on industrialised
countries' defence budgets. At the same time the world recession has also
put pressure on third world spending, the Gulf War spent much of the funds
that were available to middle eastern states and low oil prices since then
have put a cap on that normally buoyant market. Times are tough for the
world's arms manufacturers.
Most have responded to the cuts, but some have moved faster than others. In
the US weapons procurement, the part of the military budget which most
affects arms manufacturers, has fallen by almost two-thirds in real terms in
the last decade, and companies have moved quickly to meet the challenge.
Workforces have been cut heavily - employment in the US defence industry has
fallen from 1.35m in 1989 to 800,000 five years later. Manufacturers have
also rationalised their chains of suppliers and adopted many lean
manufacturing techniques now that they can no longer rely on long production
runs to offset the fearful one-off costs of weapons development.
More recently, US companies have merged or sold operations to cut overheads.
Large companies which were only peripherally involved in defence, such as
Ford, IBM and General Electric, have sold their defence arms to defence
specialists such as Martin Marietta and Loral. General Dynamics, once one of
the largest defence companies, has sold much of its business to competitors
who can consolidate the industry and returned much of the money to
shareholders.
Now the industry is moving into what Norman Augustine, chief executive of
Martin Marietta, calls the fourth and ultimate phase, where large and
dissimilar defence companies merge to reduce central costs. Earlier this
year, Northrop took over Grumman, and at the end of August the largest deal
so far was struck when Martin Marietta and Lockheed announced plans to
merge.
This is not 'vertical integration' in the conventional sense, where the
manufacturers of components merge with those who assemble them to create
giants which run all the way from raw materials to finished products.
Neither Northrop nor Grumman makes many components for the other, and while
Martin does make electronics systems, comparatively few find their way into
Lockheed aircraft.
Rather, this latest round of mergers cuts corporate overheads such as head
office costs and duplicated research and development, while at the same time
spreading risk over a larger number of weapons systems. This risk spreading
means that if one large weapons system is cancelled in the US, it is not
life-threatening for the company. For example, the deputy defence secretary,
John Deutch, recently queried the need for the 12 most expensive US
programmes. Martin Marietta is heavily involved in developing one programme,
the Comanche scout helicopter, while Lockheed is involved in another even
larger project, the Dollars 71bn F-22 stealth fighter. Delay or cancellation
of either programme would be serious for each company separately but much
easier for the combined group to weather.
As well as consolidating rapidly in their own free market, US companies are
also being much more aggressive about seeking export opportunities, and a
more relaxed Congressional attitude to overseas arms sales is helping the
cause. Yet even here the market is becoming increasingly competitive as
third world and European defence budgets fall. Historically, most arms
buyers have been interested in the performance of a weapon and buy from
their political allies or develop home-grown solutions. Now the pressure to
get value for money means many European countries are being forced to
consider cheaper off-the-shelf US weapons, to the detriment of their
indigenous arms makers, and third world buyers are running beauty parades
where western arms makers have to compete on price.
This gives the US manufacturers an advantage. While their arms have often
been more expensive, both because they were more sophisticated and because
the US has been less concerned about price, now the consolidation of
companies and the introduction of lean manufacturing techniques is closing
the gap. European manufacturers know they must respond, but are hampered by
the unwieldly structure of their market.
Natural suspicions between the ancient nation states of Europe makes them
reluctant to rely on one another for weapons supplies. Besides, several of
the large continental companies, such as Aerospatiale of France, are still
state-owned, making mergers difficult. Because cross-border consolidation is
hard many large European projects have been managed as a kind of half-way
house where there is joint development of the weapon, for example in the
Eurofighter 2000 between Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain.
While such methods save some money, much is wasted on duplication of effort
and poor co-ordination between the partners. Equally, work in development
and production is parcelled out on the basis of national commitments to a
project rather than on the basis of the most competitive bids. As a result,
the cost base of the European arms industry is higher than it need be, and
Europe gets a less effective set of weapons at a higher price than it would
get if the industry were consolidated.
The pressures that this generates were obvious at the Farnborough air show
held at the beginning of September. Serge Dassault, head of the French
Dassault fighter maker, criticised those European governments which chose to
buy US products when an acceptable European alternative was available. There
was much muttering behind the scenes about how, if at all, Europe needed to
respond to the US challenge. Some apparently thought that provided Europe
bought domestically it need take no action. Others, such as Noel Forgeard of
Matra Defence, argued that a response was necessary.
There are some signs of movement and Matra is one of the companies leading
the charge. It has been in negotiations for 18 months to merge its missile
business with British Aerospace Dynamics. It has already formed a joint
venture with GEC's space subsidiary to create Matra-Marconi space and this
recently bought BAe's space business. BAe is also at an early stage of talks
about merging its Royal Ordnance subsidiary with munitions-maker Giat of
France. Aerospatiale and Deutsche Aerospace are also discussing pooling
their missiles interests.
Yet the progress is painfully slow, and neither Europe's arms makers, nor
the politicians they supply, have a clear vision of how to mould their
ambitions to the size and shape of industry they can afford.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Industry (28): A
powerhouse of revenue - Tourism / Developing countries are cottoning on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GORDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At a recent tourism conference, held on a Thames river boat in London,
Stephen Dorrell, the UK heritage secretary, told a group of tourism leaders
that Britain needs to regain its declining share of the growing global
tourism market. At that moment, a London red bus, emblazoned with a sign
inviting Londoners to 'Visit Korea in 1994', thundered overhead on Vauxhall
Bridge.
The problem for Britain, and other traditional tourist destinations, is that
the rest of the world has cottoned on to tourism. As the biggest growth
industry, employer and source of revenue around the world, many developing
countries have realised a quicker way to buy into first world affluence is
by boosting their tourism potential rather then by selling tractors, bananas
and rice.
Global tourism, according to the World Travel &amp; Tourism Council, will double
in size between 1990 and 2005. The market has been growing by 5 per cent a
year in real terms since 1970. In 1993, the global tourism industry
generated USDollars 3,400bn in gross output, produced 10.1 per cent of GDP,
and accounted for 10.5 per cent of all jobs.
The Council says governments cannot afford to ignore the industry's role as
an economic powerhouse and should make it a strategic development priority.
The sheer size of the global industry has awakened many multinational
companies to the possibilities of global brands and market dominance. As
airlines form international networks and alliances, so, too, travel agents,
hotel brands and car hire firms are banding together.
Several companies have already made the first moves towards serving the
global tourism marketplace. The US travel agent Carlson, together with its
European counterpart Wagonlit, is now the world's largest travel agent, with
4,000 units. Carlson also wants to be the world's largest hotel brand using
its Radisson name. American Express is about to buy a large chunk of Thomas
Cook's travel agency business in North America, the largest tourism market
The only areas not targeted by the global brands are the Middle East and
Asia, where international arrivals in East Asia and the Pacific grew four
times faster than the world average in 1993, reaching a record of 69m
visitors. While arrivals were up by 12.6 per cent, revenue grew by 15.2 per
cent to USDollars 52.6bn. The World Tourism Organisation forecasts 101m
arrivals in East Asia and the Pacific by 2000, and 190m by 2010.
However, this growth may be constrained by a shortage of human resources,
the health and safety of tourists, environmental concerns, under-developed
infrastructure and local residents' unease over the number of tourists.
But global tourism growth makes it clear why the UK annual tourism revenue
growth of 5.7 per cent has caused a great deal of hand wringing within
certain UK tourism industry circles.
Robert Peel, chairman and chief executive of UK hotel company Mount
Charlotte Investments, says the world tourism market is all about value for
money.
'There is a distinct relationship between prices and volume in world
tourism. To get more tourists to the UK we have to make it worth their while
to come here. The foreign exchange rate is a big factor in the equation. The
UK is now 20 per cent better value for foreign tourists than two years ago.'
But the UK is facing tough competition in the international marketplace. For
example, Mexico, Australia and the Caribbean island of Aruba each spend more
on tourism promotion in the US than the UK does. The biggest expense of any
tourism destination is advertising and promotion. In 1993, national
governments spent USDollars 1.4bn selling themselves to the tourists.
Apart from advertising, other factors such as investment in tourism
infrastructure, new airline routes and political stability influence the
international tourists' holiday decision.
One of the most important issues impacting the MIddle East is the present
peace negotiations between Israel, the PLO, Jordan and Syria. The lack of
peace in the region has been a principal reason for the limited number of
tourist arrivals. As a whole, the Middle East in its best year of 1992
attracted only 2 per cent of the world's tourist arrivals or 9m visitors,
compared to Greece which also attracted 9m.
Israel stands to benefit the most in terms of tourism from the recent peace
process. Tourist arrivals in Israel reached a record level of 1.65m last
year. Lasting peace in the region would create a vast influx of business and
leisure tourists in Israel. Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria could also expect to
see a sizeable increase in tourism.
Vietnam is the latest fashionable destination for tourists. There has been
huge growth in tourism to Vietnam, but the figures are relatively small.
Most visitors are business people as tourist visas are hard to obtain.
Foreign investment in Vietnam in the first quarter of this year jumped by 58
per cent compared to the same period last year. Between 1988 and 1990, most
projects involving foreign money were in the hotel and oil sectors. The
total amount of foreign investment in 1994 is expected to reach USDollars
3.5bn, of which 70 per cent is in joint ventures.
The emergence and acceptability of Vietnam was confirmed recently when
British Airways announced that it is negotiating to operate two flights per
week from London to Ho Chi Minh City.
Robert Burns, chairman of the World Travel &amp; Tourism Council, believes
Shanghai will emerge in 10 years as the most important Asian city. A new
airport, which could handle 150 landings an hour, is being built. Hotels in
Shanghai are operating at near capacity and room rates are rocketing.
As Mr Burns pointed out, Japan now has a policy, the result of a balance of
trade problem, that 20 per cent of its population should travel abroad by
2010. If China ever had just two 2 per cent of its population travelling
overseas, the rest of the world would be inundated with Chinese tourists.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Industry (26): Bitter
medicine for producers - Pharmaceuticals / Paul Abrahams discusses the
attacks on drugs bills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Worldwide recession and falling tax receipts have focused attention on
escalating healthcare costs. Last year the US spent almost Dollars 1,000bn
on healthcare, equivalent to 14 per cent of the country's GNP. That is more
than two and a half times the proportion it was spending 30 years ago. The
US is not alone. In Japan over the same period the proportion of GNP spent
on health more than doubled from 2.9 per cent to 6.6 per cent, while in
France it also doubled to 9.1 per cent.
The cause of the increase is ever more expensive and advanced technologies
and ageing populations. For some nations the ageing problem presents
appalling difficulties. Naturally, an elderly population consumes greater
healthcare resources than a young one. In Japan, the most affected country,
the proportion of those 65 and over will increase from 5.7 per cent of the
population in 1960 to 23.9 per cent in 2025. The trend is less pronounced in
most developed nations.
Faced with ever-greater healthcare costs, payers, ranging from governments
to insurers and businesses, have been targeting pharmaceuticals. In some
respects this is unfair. Except in Japan, drugs seldom consume a significant
proportion of healthcare spending. In the UK and US, for example, spending
on medicines represents 10 per cent and 7 per cent of all healthcare
spending.
However, politicians realise it is easier to slash spending on drugs than to
cut hospital beds or suppress medical posts. The industry, particularly in
the US, has not helped itself. In the late 1980s, many companies in the US
raised prices in a manner that some senior executives now admit was
scandalous. During six years in the late 1980s and early 1990s the price of
some drugs increased by more than 100 per cent, while the consumer price
index rose only 26.2 per cent. Subsequent arguments put forward by the
industry about the cost-effectiveness of using drugs were swept aside.
Attacks on medicine bills have hit every significant pharmaceuticals market
over the past 24 months. Last year, the German market collapsed by 9 per
cent after healthcare reforms. The US market also decelerated to only 5 per
cent growth, compared with double-digit growth in the late 1990s. This year
it has been the turn of the Japanese, French and Italian markets to
collapse, all registering static growth or falls. The UK, Spanish, Dutch and
Belgian markets have also recorded reduced growth rates.
The world pharmaceuticals market, which during the late 1980s was growing at
between 17 per cent and 20 per cent - including US price rises - slowed to
only 4 per cent last year, according to IMS International, the London-based
market research company. It is growing no faster this year. Brokers Lehman
Brothers estimate the world market will grow at no more than 5 per cent for
the rest of the decade.
The impact of this deceleration in growth on the pharmaceuticals industry
has been marked. Faced with falling volumes, the inability to raise prices
and, in the US, price competition, individual companies are suffering.
Brokers Goldman Sachs estimate Glaxo's sales growth will slow from 20 per
cent last year to 5.4 per cent next year and only 3 per cent in 1997.
That is one of the industry's success stories. The sales of Marion Merrell
Dow are, in contrast, in free fall. Down 16 per cent last year, the brokers
believe they will fall 12 per cent this year, 8 per cent next year and a
further 4 per cent in 1996. The drugs industry's reaction has been to
rationalise and consolidate. Job losses, particularly in the US, have
already begun. More are in prospect. Lehman brothers reckon up to 200,000
jobs could disappear worldwide before the end of the decade.
Cost-cutting is already affecting spending on research and development,
hitherto viewed as the industry's life-blood. Last year, five of the world's
top 45 drugs groups actually cut spending on research and development (R&amp;D).
Among the US's largest 12 companies, 11 moderated the growth of R&amp;D spending
in 1993. Pfizer was the only exception. In the UK, the speed of deceleration
has been spectacular. Glaxo increased its spending by 25 per cent two years
ago, 24 per cent last year, 16 per cent this year and expects to increase by
less than 5 per cent in 1995.
The deceleration in R&amp;D spending may not be a bad thing. According to the
UK-based Centre for Medicines Research, R&amp;D spending increased from Dollars
5.5bn in 1981 to Dollars 30bn last year. Lehman Brothers, which estimates
R&amp;D spending was Dollars 28bn last year, reckons that if companies want a
return on R&amp;D investment of 10 per cent, and the market grows only 5 per
cent a year, then the industry can support R&amp;D investment of only Dollars
11.8bn - an overspend of more than Dollars 16bn.
In spite of this overspend, some groups clearly do not invest enough to
sustain a regular flow of innovative medicines. Developing copy-cat drugs,
known as 'me-too' drugs, is no longer adequate for survival. Healthcare
payers will no longer fork out premiums for only slight medical
improvements. In addition, most drugs groups do not have the capability to
develop medicines on an international basis, in the world's three largest
markets: the US, Japan, and Europe. Unless companies have such a capability
they will not adequately recoup the cost of their R&amp;D investment.
Some drugs companies have attempted to boost their chances of developing
innovative drugs by forging links with biotechnology companies. Many of the
most exciting ideas in medicines are emanating from this source.
The failure to develop innovative drugs is causing a rationalisation of the
industry's structure. Syntex, the US group which failed to find replacement
products for its top-selling medicine after its US patents expired, was
forced to sell to Roche of Switzerland. American Home Products slipped from
being the world's biggest drugs company in the 1970s to number seven because
it failed to develop enough good quality drugs. Last month, it bought
American Cyanamid for Dollars 9.7bn.
Other companies are diversifying. Some, such as SmithKline Beecham, have
strengthened their non-prescription business because the over-the-counter
medicine market is growing faster than the prescription business, and
because although margins are lower, the revenue streams are more
predictable.
The drugs industry remains fragmented. Merck, the world's largest group,
controls just 5 per cent of the global market. In 1993, the top 10 companies
had a combined market share of only 29 per cent. The top 20 controlled just
50 per cent. It is clear the industry must consolidate even more.

Prescription for cuts is managed competition - Healthcare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The need to cut budget deficits is forcing most governments to look
critically at the cost of healthcare, one of the largest components of
public expenditure in advanced economies.
Spending on health as a proportion of national income has more than doubled
in the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development over the past 30 years.
This increase has been driven by a number of factors, including the
extension of healthcare to cover whole populations. Unit costs such as the
salaries of doctors and nurses have risen and new and more expensive types
of treatment have been devised. The ageing of populations has also had an
impact, since elderly people make greater use of health services.
Much of the burden has been borne by the public purse. With the notable
exception of the US, between 70 per cent and 90 per cent of health spending
in most advanced economies is financed publicly. Healthcare typically
accounts for between 12 per cent and 15 per cent of public expenditure.
The rate of growth of health budgets has eased in recent years. Some
countries such as Germany and Ireland have even managed to achieve cuts in
the share of GDP going to healthcare during the 1980s.
The slowdown has been achieved by a combination of measures that health
economists have dubbed 'managed competition', the use of market-type
incentives to raise efficiency and improve the quality of care. These
measures have been found to work in a wide range of countries with very
different health systems.
In some, for example, healthcare is paid for out of taxation. In others, it
is financed by compulsory insurance contributions paid either to private
insurers, public bodies or a mixture of both.
The extent to which patients are expected to contribute towards treatment
costs, the methods of reimbursing hospitals and doctors, and the role of the
private sector also vary considerably.
Yet despite these differences, a recent OECD study of health reforms in
seven European countries found a remarkable degree of convergence in the
policies adopted to curb rising costs. The common key was universal funding
under government direction - even where private insurers pay for health
services.
Only governments can provide the discipline on costs to bear down on
hospitals, surgeons and the pharmaceutical industry. And only governments
can insist on universal coverage, which allows medical care to be allocated
according to need, rather than ability to pay.
Without this universal cover, insurers select the healthier groups, leaving
the vulnerable and ageing with no cover or reliant on state-funded safety
nets. The result is that - as in the US - the middle classes pay twice: once
for their own health insurance and again through taxation for the safety
net.
The creation of a capped, universal budget does not, however, mean
socialised medicine delivered through a centralised bureaucracy. Managed
competition establishes quasi-markets in which hospitals, doctors and other
health organisations compete to provide health services. This provides
incentives to improve efficiency through, for example, less frequent use of
hospitals for simple operations and greater use of daycare.
Costs are also reduced by paying for healthcare by contracts for the
provision of services rather than through fees for each item of treatment
which encourages 'overtreatment'. When Ireland switched to an annual
'capitation fee', doctors' consultation rates fell by a fifth.
Several other policy changes can also help in reducing the gap between
healthcare demand and funding. These include 'co-payments' by patients,
which encourage them to behave more like consumers in balancing demand
against cost.
And competition between the organisations that fund healthcare can improve
the quality of services and provide further efficiency incentives. In the
Netherlands, ambitious reforms plan to offer a choice of insurance packages,
all offering a basic minimum but with different levels of service and
additional benefits.
The US is the one advanced economy that relies largely on voluntary private
insurance to provide its healthcare and has yet to adopt managed
competition. The result is that health spending is still rising and accounts
for 14 per cent of GDP (the OECD average is 8 per cent).
While much of the cost is borne privately, the burden of employer-financed
insurance cover weighs heavily on business. And the cost of the two
publicly-funded safety net schemes, Medicare and Medicaid, has spiralled, so
that health accounts for a higher proportion of public expenditure than in
some countries with health services entirely funded from the public purse.
The ambitious Clinton reform plan involves most of the elements of managed
competition, with universal coverage, budget capping and capitation
payments. It is in difficulty in Congress, and now seems unlikely to survive
intact. But the compromises and most of the alternative plans under
discussion would move in a similar direction - though perhaps less
radically. While the exact shape of the US healthcare system by the end of
the decade has yet to be finalised, it, too, is likely to join the
convergence in other OECD countries.
Successful though managed competition has been in slowing growth in health
spending, the pace of reform needs to develop and intensify to cope with the
continuing increase in demand for healthcare.
A recent survey of 10 OECD countries by National Economic Research
Associates, the economic consultants, found that on present trends, all
would face a shortfall in funding by 2000. The shortfalls ranged from 2 per
cent of GDP in the US to around 9 per cent in the Netherlands.
The gap is partly caused by demographic change. Increased life expectancy
may not mean more direct medical care: the extra cost of treating the very
elderly is likely to be offset to some extent by the decline of chronic
diseases among younger people. But there will be an increase in demand for
geriatric care and social services for the elderly, encouraged by the
decline of the extended family in which older people were cared for by
younger relatives.
But it is also caused by rising expectations about the quality and amount of
health services, fuelled by the arrival of new and more expensive forms of
treatment.
Healthcare is a 'merit good' in economists' terms: as people become better
off, they spend an increasing proportion of their income on health services.
The correlation between health expenditure per capita and overall income per
capita has become more pronounced in recent decades. This suggests that the
struggle to contain the burden of healthcare on public budgets will have to
continue into the future, using all the techniques in the armoury of managed
competition.

Comeback by US carmakers - Motor industry / Kevin Done explains why the
tables have been turned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The tables have been turned in the world motor industry. After several years
of intense pain and record losses the big three US carmakers had moved
strongly back to record profits by the second quarter this year.
Earnings at General Motors, Ford and Chrysler are continuing to rise
strongly, while several of their European and Japanese rivals are still
struggling to fight their way out of recession and away from the red ink,
that has washed over their operations.
Sales of cars and light trucks in the US are now in the third year of
recovery and are forecast to rise by 12 per cent this year to more than
15.5m. In Europe the tide also appears to have turned this year, while in
Japan the signs of a turnaround remain fragile, although the most recent
sales figures suggest that demand is no longer falling.
New car sales in western Europe fell by more than 15 per cent last year to
11.45m, the sharpest annual decline in the post-war period, while new car
sales in Japan have fallen for three years in succession.
The recession has bottomed out in western Europe with sales in the first
seven months rising by an estimated 6 per cent year-on-year to 7.42m, but
there are fears that the rate of improvement may weaken in the second half
of the year.
New car demand worldwide fell last year to the lowest level for six years,
but the recovery this year has ended three successive years of falling
sales, and the outlook for the medium term is promising.
The latest study by DRI/McGraw-Hill, the London-based automotive analysts,
forecasts that a sustained period of growth is in prospect with worldwide
new car sales rising gradually to reach record levels throughout the second
half of the 1990s. Sales worldwide are forecast to increase by 6.4 per cent
this year to 35.3m from the low point of 33.1m last year.
The recovery was driven first by the strong rise in demand in North America
and by continuing significant growth in the Asia/Pacific region (excluding
Japan).
'Global car sales could rise by 6 per cent or more this year as Europe pulls
itself out of recession, joining the expanding markets of North America,
Latin America and Asia/Pacific,' says the latest DRI report. 'There
nevertheless remain problem areas with Japan still in recession and the
economic crisis of Turkey producing something close to a collapse in the
market.'
The rate of growth will gather pace in 1995 as both the German and Italian
markets emerge from recession, and sales in western Europe are forecast to
rise by around 5 per cent a year in each of the four years from 1994 to
reach a record level of 13.7m in 1996 and 14.4m in 1997.
New car sales worldwide are forecast by DRI to rise by close to 30 per cent
to 42.6m in 1999 from 33.1m last year. However, much of this growth will
originate outside the traditional car consuming nations of western Europe,
North America and Japan. South Korea, China, Thailand, Latin America and
eastern Europe offer the best outlook for growth for the 1990s and beyond.
The world's leading carmakers are united in the view that the Asia/Pacific
region holds the brightest prospects, and automotive sales in Asia
(excluding Japan) are expected to triple during the next 15 years.
According to Alex Trotman, chairman and chief executive of Ford, the world's
second largest vehicle maker, around 80 per cent of the world's population
lives outside the traditional automotive markets of western Europe, North
America and Japan, but the number of cars and trucks sold in these regions
represents only about 8 per cent of the world's total.
The European industry is in the midst of hectic transition, as the European
Union moves to become an open car market by the end of the decade with the
removal of all quota restrictions on car and light commercial vehicle
exports from Japan at the end of 1999.
Several of the first wave of Japanese car plants in Europe - built by
Nissan, Toyota and Honda - are now in production and Mitsubishi Motors is
due to open its first European car plant next year in a joint venture with
Volvo.
Four of the big six volume car producers in western Europe, the Volkswagen
group of Germany, PSA Peugeot Citroen of France, the Fiat group of Italy and
Ford of Europe, were in loss last year, while profits declined steeply at
Renault of France and General Motors Europe (Opel in continental Europe and
Vauxhall in the UK). The pressure of recession and the need to rationalise
has forced all vehicle makers in Europe to reduce their workforces.
The deep recession in Europe and Japan has slowed the previously inexorable
advance by Japanese car producers into the world market.
Under heavy pressure from the rising value of the yen, Japanese carmakers
have been forced to raise their prices in the US and in Europe faster than
their American rivals, which has begun to bite into their market share
abroad.
At home Japanese carmakers have suffered an unprecedented period of three
successive years of falling demand. Several producers have fallen into loss,
most notably Nissan, the country's second largest vehicle producer, and
Mazda.
The Japanese industry is being forced to restructure at a time when it is
burdened by high fixed costs and high depreciation following recent years of
heavy capital expenditure and the building of new assembly capacity in
Japan. It no longer enjoys the advantages of earlier years of an undervalued
yen and cheap money.
In contrast to the dramatic proliferation of new products at the end of the
1980s, Japanese carmakers are now having to cut the number of model variants
and types of options offered, which have 'proliferated excessively' in
recent years, according to Yoshifumi Tsuji, president of Nissan.
Difficult times have called for some drastic re-thinking of corporate
strategies.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Industry (24): Farmers
are waiting for ratification - Agriculture / Alan Swinbank examines the
effects of the Uruguay Round agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN SWINBANK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Throughout the post-war period, while western governments progressively
liberalised world trade for industrial goods, most countries protected their
domestic farm sectors. As a result world markets for agricultural and food
products suffered from depressed and destabilised prices.
In large part, this stemmed from deviations from the normal rules of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which had been obtained by the US in
the 1950s. These provisions allowed import controls and export subsidies to
be used in conjunction with domestic farm policies when such trade measures
would have been unacceptable for manufactured goods.
Subsequently, with the formation of the European Economic Community, the
forerunner of today's European Union, and the development of the Common
Agricultural Policy (CAP), the EU's intransigent defence of the CAP has been
a significant disruptive force.
As the world's largest importer, and second largest exporter of agricultural
products, the EU's policy stance was bound to have important ramifications
for world agricultural trade.
In the Uruguay Round of Gatt negotiations, agricultural protectionism was
seriously addressed. Assuming that the agreement of December 1993 is
ratified later this year, the Gatt contracting parties will start to
dismantle their protectionist farm policies next year.
The agreement is complex, but in essence all existing import controls must
be converted into conventional import tariffs, a process known as
tariffication. The developed countries of the world then have six years to
reduce tariffs by 36 per cent on average. Export subsidies must also be
reduced by 36 per cent, the volume of subsidised exports by 21 per cent, and
the overall level of farm support by 20 per cent. Certain policy measures
deemed to have no impact upon production levels are exempt from control.
Some observers believe that this agreement will sweep aside the livelihoods
of European and Japanese farmers, leaving the countryside depopulated, the
environment despoiled, and citizens dependent upon imported supplies.
Greater malnutrition and starvation may occur in low-income countries unable
to afford the increased import bill for food supplies. Others suggest that
the agreement will not have these dire consequences, but will result in some
improvement in agricultural trade.
It is expected that world prices will rise, but these increases will be much
less than the efficient agricultural exporters such as Australia might hope
for, and the low-income food importing countries might fear.
An Australian study of the agreement suggests that, once the full impact of
the changes is felt, well into the next century, world wheat prices might be
8 per cent higher then they would otherwise be, those for dairy products 4
(butter) to 20 (cheese) per cent higher, with meats increasing by 3 to 7 per
cent.
Even these modest estimates may be too high. While sticking strictly to the
letter of the agreement, countries have the right to minimise its impact on
their own farm policies; and it is expected that most of them  - certainly
the EU - will do so. Furthermore, in many instances tariffication has
produced highly protective import barriers which, even when reduced by 36
per cent, will result in little import penetration.
Developing countries dependent upon imported cereal supplies will see an
increase in the cost of imports. However, many development economists have
argued that the microeconomic incentives that this world price increase will
bring to bear on governments to change their policies, and farmers to
increase supply, will outweigh the macroeconomic burdens borne by the
economy. Fears that food aid will be more difficult to obtain are probably
misplaced, because intervention stocks in the subsidised exporting regions
of the world are likely to increase as a consequence of the Gatt limits on
subsidised exports.
When currencies are non-convertible, foreign exchange in short supply, and
distribution systems poorly developed, then food supplies are heavily
dependent upon the productive capacity of local farmers.
While this is undoubtedly true of many regions of the world, such a
situation does not prevail in western Europe, where international
buying-power and modern distribution systems mean that a cornucopia of food
products can be delivered to food stores.
The CAP indisputably affects the price, quality and origins of the food
Europeans eat, but it is a fallacy to believe that they are dependent upon
the CAP for food supplies. Short of a calamitous disruption to the world
food system, European food stores will remain full even if the GATT deal
does result in a significant fall in EU farm production. But the output of
European agriculture is unlikely to collapse; first, because of the
continuing productivity growth, which will result in ever-increasing yields
despite the yield-reducing effects of price cuts; and second, because the
land and labour, on which European agriculture depends, will be encouraged
to remain in the sector, so that it can benefit from the continued payment
of Gatt-exempt taxpayer-funded subsidies.
Yet, while the overall impact, for good or ill, of the Gatt agreement is
unlikely to be dramatic, it would be wrong to dismiss it as being of little
relevance. It took many years, and several Gatt deals, to reduce
significantly trade barriers on manufactured goods, and it would naive to
presume that faster progress could be achieved in the more heavily protected
agricultural arena.
The Uruguay Round is a success in that it extends Gatt disciplines to
agricultural trade, and increases the transparency of the support mechanisms
in place. In accordance with the agreement, new negotiations are to be
embarked upon before the end of the decade with the express intent of
securing further substantial reductions in farm support. This timescale will
allow farm and other rural businesses to undertake gradual adjustment, and
governments to pursue policies which facilitate global food security and
environmental protection.
The danger is that governments will attempt to backslide from their recent
commitments to reduce agricultural protectionism, and in the pursuit of
unsustainable policies generate greater uncertainty for agricultural trade.
If the EU, for example, falters in its resolve to reform the CAP, a new
budgetary crisis could result in the abrupt abolition of farm support,
resulting in a mass of bankruptcies in farming and related industries, and a
destabilising shock to world agricultural prices.

management at the University of Reading.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Industry (21): Boxes
and pipes are the stuff of a revolution - Telecommunications, computer and
media industries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Old hands in the communications business have been experiencing a sharp
sense of deja vu over the past few months.
Telecommunications, computer and media companies have been striking deals
and forming alliances suggesting that the long-anticipated phenomenon of
convergence may be at hand.
Convergence implies the coming together of communications channels and data
processing capabilities to provide services ranging from information to
entertainment and shopping, to the office and the home.
At the heart of the business is the fact that information of every kind  -
text, moving pictures, sound and graphics - can be converted to binary
digits, transmitted over telecommunications lines and manipulated by
computer.
These days people are using the term multimedia to describe convergence but
some would argue that nothing seems to have changed since the 1970s when
online information services for the mass market were pioneered with no great
success. Examples include home banking in the US and viewdata in the UK.
What is different today? Costs have come down appreciably, technologies have
improved and matured and the regulatory environment favours the introduction
of innovative services in the US and, increasingly, Europe and the rest of
the world.
The components of the multimedia revolution are the 'boxes', the computers
which process the data, the 'pipes', the telecommunications channels into
the home and office, and the 'stuff', the media content.
While most attention has so far been focused on expensive deals involving
content providers, most leading computer hardware and software companies
have been experimenting with elements of multimedia.
Oracle Corporation, for example, the world's third largest software company
with revenues of Dollars 1.3bn in 1993, announced an alliance with Bell
Atlantic, a US regional television company, to offer commercial interactive
television services in the US.
Oracle is a specialist in database management; this year it announced the
Oracle Media Server, a technology that expands Oracle's management of
information to audio, video, text and images. The plan is to use this
software to manage thousands of films for 'video-on-demand' as well as home
shopping and information services. The software can be run on a variety of
computers. For the Bell Atlantic collaboration, a supercomputer, a massively
parallel system developed by the Californian company nCube will be used.
Other companies have taken somewhat similar approaches. International
Business Machines, Digital Equipment, and Hewlett Packard have all developed
systems which are being used in interactive television trials. IBM, for
example, is working with Andersen Consulting and Ameritech, one of the seven
US regional Bell telecoms operators, on a trial in Chicago which will offer
home shopping, electronic magazines and training. The system is based around
one of IBM's largest mainframes.
The US computer giant has one of the longest lists of industrial partners in
multimedia. It includes Sony for mini-disk titles, PictureTel and British
Telcom for desktop videoconferencing systems, Muze for multimedia kiosks and
Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation for digital entertainments.
Microsoft, the world's largest software company, has a distinctly different
approach. It launched in May this year software it calls 'Tiger'. Tiger is
the result of collaboration with Compaq, the personal computer maker, and
Intel, the semiconductor manufacturer.
The essence of Tiger, according to Microsoft, is that it can provide
multimedia suppliers with the 'boxes' at a fraction of the cost of systems
from other developers. The Tiger software runs on inexpensive microcomputers
such as Intel's top-of-the-line Pentium microprocessor. Microsoft has
alliances with TCI, the US cable television company, and NTT, the Japanese
telecommunications group, for multimedia trials in the US planned for the
end of this year.
However, it is important to get the pace of convergence in perspective. A
brief glance at the telecoms sector shows that most recent corporate
activity - and expenditure on alliances and joint ventures - has been
expended on promoting or defending against competition in core telecoms
services.
In the US, most of the successful big alliances of the past year have been
of this kind. The Dollars 13bn take-over of McCaw Cellular Communications by
AT&amp;T, for instance, amounts to the swallowing-up of one phone company by
another. In this case the 'convergence' at stake is within the industry - ie
the coming together of fixed-wire and cellular telephony services.
By contrast, several large cross-media deals have collapsed in the past year
 -once the partners got to know more about each other's business. In April,
Southwestern Bell, a Baby Bell, abandoned plans to form a Dollars 4.9bn
cable television partnership with Cox Enterprises, the privately-owned media
group. That came shortly after the spectacular collapse of the Dollars 22bn
proposed merger of Tele-Communications Inc, the largest cable company, and
Bell Atlantic, the Philadelphia-based Baby Bell.
There is a growing belief among analysts that tie-ups between the telecoms
and cable/entertainment/computing industries are going to proceed much more
slowly than envisaged a year ago.
Even successful cross-media alliances are not always all that they seem. The
decision by US West, another Baby Bell telecoms company, to take a 25.5 per
cent stake in Time Warner Entertainment, for instance, was motivated by its
desire to offer telephony services over Time Warner's cable networks. Says
Mr Chuck Lillis, US West's chief planning officer: 'The Time Warner deal is
essentially about giving us more networks. Of course, they've also got the
best studios in the country, and the longer you go out in time, the more it
is about having access to their programming and products.'
The building of fibre-optic superhighways opens up the market for
interactive multimedia services as never before. Analysts debate the
timescale, but the destination is now increasingly clear. The key question
is whether telecoms companies become providers of services, or simply
utility-style managers of networks.
The telecoms companies dearly want to be providers, perceiving utility
network management to be a low margin, unexciting business. Their problem is
that they know little about the new types of services, and have difficulty
justifying mega-alliances on present revenue projections.
Sir Iain Vallance, chairman of British Telecommunications, frankly confesses
that BT has 'serious thinking' to do in this area. BT decided to steer clear
of home banking - 'a close call' - and has left banks themselves to provide
home telephone banking services, such as First Direct, without itself
competing in the market.
The next few years are set to pose a series of close calls, the outcome of
which will determine whether convergence predominantly involves technologies
and services, or comes to herald massive industrial restructuring.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Industry (22): Hype
obscures real needs - Convergence / Andrew Adonis on the information
superhighway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It used to be simple. Telephone calls mostly travelled across copper wires,
and mobile phones, using cellular technology, were expensive yuppie toys
used only by thrusting professionals.
In fact, most of the world never had - and still does not have - telephone
connections of any kind. The challenge for the telecoms industry is to meet
basic telecommunications needs in the developing world, while the developed
world races ahead to the 'information superhighway' that will turn the
conventional telephony into one of several services provided via a
multimedia 'terminal' which, in all likelihood, will turn out to be the
personal computer.
The race to the 'superhighways' has generated an industry of writers vying
with each other to paint the most plausible and/or exciting picture of the
multimedia world as the computing, telecoms, and entertainment industries
converge. The FT's front page recently featured a US company planning to
offer virtual reality weddings - in heaven, if requested - and its business
pages are taken up, day by day, with proposed multibillion-dollar mergers or
alliances between companies in the different sectors.
However, it is important not to soar away on hype, which too easily results
from a failure to grasp three key facts about the future of
telecommunications:
First, the priority for the developing world is not virtual reality, but
basic telephone lines. The need is to vastly increase network coverage
within a few years. China, for instance, wants to boost its number of basic
telephone lines from about 30m to 120m by 2000, an increase equivalent to
three times the existing network of British Telecommunications. Barely two
in 100 Chinese have a telephone line, compared with 49 per 100 in
neighbouring Hong Kong.
'We used to think it was new roads that mattered; now we realise that
telecoms links are more important - and a crucial agent for growth,' a
senior Chinese official puts it. OECD studies chart a direct relationship
between growth in telephone line density and economic growth: the precise
projections are debatable, but no one denies that for developing countries
there is a close connection.
Second, in the free world buyers, not sellers, sustain markets. The
multimedia industry has got to come up with saleable products - and they are
mostly still in their infancy. Even such obvious products as home shopping
and video-on-demand are making slow, faltering progress.
Third, convergence within industries can be as important as convergence
between industries, even if it is less exciting to observe.
This last point is particularly relevant for today's telecoms industry,
where potentially the most significant technological development is the
convergence of 'fixed' and 'cellular' systems.
In the developed world, 'fixed' phones are becoming increasingly mobile,
with the introduction of 'intelligent networks' which enable, for instance,
personal numbering systems to track subscribers down to their location via a
single number. As Torbjorn Nilsson, strategic planning director at Ericsson
radio systems, the Swedish supplier, puts it: 'People want to call people,
not places.'
Meanwhile, the falling cost and increasing versatility of cellular systems
is rapidly turning the mobile phone into a consumer good. It is only a
matter of time before a single handset will be able to relate to both fixed
and mobile networks, with the user unaware of the means by which the call is
being transmitted.
However, the implications of fixed/cellular convergence are perhaps even
more profound for the developing world, with the development of 'fixed
cellular' systems which could slash the cost of installing infrastructure to
provide basic line connections. 'For us, fixed cellular is one of the most
significant things happening in the industry,' says Nagarajan Vittal,
chairman of India's telecommunications commission. He sees it playing a 'key
role' in lifting India's number of telephone lines from the present 8m.
Fixed cellular is still in its early stages, but developments in Mexico and
Indonesia may offer significant pointers to the future.
Indonesia boasts 16 telephone lines per 1,000 people - compared with 460 per
1,000 in the UK - putting it towards the bottom of the telephony league even
in the Asia-Pacific region. To help achieve rapid line growth the Indonesian
government has licensed a company to build a 'fixed cellular' network in
urban areas.
The network is for fixed telephones serviced by radio base stations.
Initially connection and call charges will be similar to those for
conventional fixed-line telephones, with a monthly rental higher to reflect
a shorter waiting period for connection. But in time fixed cellular charges
could be far cheaper.
Ratelindo, the new fixed cellular operator, is a joint venture between
Indonesia's state-owned telecoms operator and Bakrie Electronics, a private
company. It is licensed to provide 280,000 fixed cellular connections -
250,000 in Jakarta and 30,000 in West Java.
Its fixed cellular system - supplied by Hughes, a US manufacturer - is a
flexible overlay network based on the US TDMA digital system. Ratelindo
claims that it provides a voice quality equal to that of a fixed-wire
telephone.
Hardianto Kamarga, president-director of Ratelindo, hails the Hughes system
as a breakthrough, saying it is 'the most spectrum efficient digital
cellular technology commercially available today', with about three times
the capacity - that is subscribers per base station - of GSM, the digital
cellular mobile system used in Europe.
'The fixed cellular system has a subscriber capacity equal to between 10 and
20 per cent of the fixed network,' says Mr Kamarga. As for the cost: 'at the
moment landline telephones are less expensive than comparable wireless
systems for the same traffic capacity, but in the operating environment we
have in Indonesia the balance can swing in favour of wireless.' As fixed
cellular evolves, the balance in its favour is likely to shift dramatically
 -and with it the economics of telecoms modernisation in the developed
world.

Strategies build upon knowledge base - Globalisation / Stephanie Flanders
examines the explosion in cross-border investment flows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Contrary to popular belief, the globalisation of capital is nothing new. In
fact, relative to world output, cross-border investment flows are only now
approaching the level reached before the first world war. Foreign direct
investment represented 9 per cent of world output in 1913, according to some
estimates, compared to 8.5 per cent in 1991.
Historians, it seems, would be unimpressed with the explosion of
international investment flows described in the chart. Why is it that
pundits and policymakers are impressed?
One answer is that today's high degree of capital mobility contrasts sharply
with that of the more recent past. In the inter-war period, the world's
leading economies turned inwards, and international markets for goods and
capital largely collapsed. In a sense, recent trends have simply rebuilt
them.
But this more recent push towards economic integration also differs from the
earlier one in important respects, and it is the differences which most
concern governments. Technological change and deregulation have not only
opened up the world market; they are increasingly changing the global
production process itself. Individual countries worry that they can no
longer choose their role.
The first difference is that the production and sale of goods is
internationalised at a deeper level. This year's United Nations World
Investment Report states that as much as a third of world output is now
directly controlled by transnational corporations (TNCs); 'their indirect
influence is almost certainly much greater'.
As in the 19th century, a UK company, can set up a factory in Brazil, either
to meet home demand or to gain access to the Brazilian market. In 1993,
there were some 206,000 foreign affiliates of multinational companies
located worldwide: up from 3,500 in the early 1960s. Their combined sales in
1991 exceeded world exports by more than 20 per cent.
But that same multinational can also opt for making just one input at the
Brazilian plant, co-ordinating the process of making and selling the final
product across countless national borders. Indeed, more than a third of
world trade flows in 1989 were within companies, compared to one fifth in
the early 1970s. Economist David Levy calculates that the value of US
'intra-firm' exports rose by 70 per cent in the 1982-9 period alone.
The second difference lies in the nature of the goods themselves.
Information technology has enabled companies to co-ordinate their
traditional activities worldwide, as outlined earlier. But exploiting the
latest computer and communications technology to do so means that the
'knowledge' aspect of their operations is more important.
It is not surprising that financial organisations were among the first to
exploit the globalising potential of the 'information revolution'.
Communicating information efficiently has long been at the core of their
business. But even in old-fashioned sectors, such as automobile
manufacturing, companies are finding they must compete as much on their
ability to deploy knowledge as on their simple capacity to make cars.
In these global industries, 'the new barrier to entry is not volume or
price', argues Robert Reich, former Harvard academic and now US secretary of
labour. 'It is skill in finding the right fit between particular
technologies and particular markets. Core corporations no longer focus on
products as such: their business strategies increasingly centre upon
specialised knowledge.'
What does this imply for public policy? For one, governments will have to
get used to the fact that a significant part of the workforce works for a
company headquartered abroad. Mr Reich has argued that this makes
traditional industrial policy redundant: public aid for 'national champions'
may just as well end up creating jobs abroad.
Others claim nationality still dominates a company's outlook. Yet there is
now a more tenuous link between where a corporation is registered, and where
its workforce is located. According to the OECD, nearly two thirds as many
people are employed in the foreign affiliates of Dutch multinationals as
hold jobs in the manufacturing sector at home.
Statistics like that one raise the fear that internationalisation spells
fewer jobs in rich countries where labour is expensive. But international
league tables based on wages alone can be highly misleading. Even if a
company makes its location decisions solely on the basis of cheap labour
(which is rare), what matters will be the productivity of that labour, not
merely its price. Developed country workers can compete if they have the
skills and equipment to justify the higher price.
Nevertheless, rich country worries about employment relate to a broader
concern about the global power of TNCs. If communication and transport links
allow firms to operate where they like, the fear is that governments can
only aspire to keeping out of their way. Nations can no longer plot their
separate economic paths.
The authors of the World Investment Report, among others, dispute this
interpretation. Recent experience, they argue, shows that both 'governments
and geography still matter'; and only part of the policy recipe for national
success will be laisser-faire.
Admittedly, some of the diversity of that experience across countries comes
from misguided attempts to go it alone. Oppressive and insular regulations
and taxes can deter foreign direct investment and employment from a country,
just as wiser policies can encourage it. Fully three-quarters of all foreign
direct investment in developing countries in the 1980s went to 10 countries.
State-led liberalisation efforts were a key factor attracting outside
investors.
But countries will continue to differ for more positive reasons in a global
economy, all allowing a wide scope for government activism. For,
paradoxically, perhaps, a globalised strategy tends to make local networks
even more important to a firm's ability to 'add value', whether it is in
creative research and development, team-based 'just-in-time' production, or
locally tailored product marketing. The state has a crucial role in
providing the necessary environment for such networks to thrive: not least,
an educated and flexible workforce and sound public infrastructure. Thanks
to the globalisation of their appeal, the national rewards of doing so are
larger than ever.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Industry (19): Choice
between more jobs and good jobs - Unemployment / Economic recovery will not
on its own provide the answers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This has been the year for the jobless, not so much for helping them as for
talking about them. This is not surprising, since the level of measured
unemployment stands at 35m (8 1/2 per cent) in the members of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and 24m in the group
of seven leading industrial countries alone. The concern is also
appropriate, despite the fact that economic recovery has spread to most
industrial countries. Recovery will reduce unemployment. But it will not, on
its own, lower it to levels once deemed socially essential, especially in
Europe.
In fact, the year of the jobless started last December with the release of
the European Commission's White Paper on growth, competitiveness and
employment. This was followed, in March, by President Clinton's jobs summit
in Detroit. Then, in June, there appeared the OECD's long-awaited jobs
study.
Finally, at the G7 summit in Naples, the leaders endorsed a seven-point plan
to tackle this scourge. The plan called for: improved skills, through better
education and training; reduced labour rigidities, through lower indirect
employment costs and fewer regulations; active labour market policies, to
enhance incentives for the unemployed to seek work; assistance to promote
innovation and the spread of new technology, including an integrated
infrastructure for global communications; job creation in the leisure and
environmental protection industries, which are regarded as potential
high-growth areas; increased competition, through elimination of unnecessary
regulations; and programmes to enrol employers and trade unions in the
search for new jobs.
The approach is highly eclectic, for two reasons: first, because of
divergent views within the G7 about the relative weights to be given to
market forces and government intervention; and, second, because there is not
one employment problem, but the two distinct ones of jobs and pay.
On jobs, the North Americans have triumphed over the Europeans. During the
past 35 years, employment in North America has risen 80 per cent, while in
the European Union it has risen only 10 per cent. The unemployment rate has
shown little upward trend in North America, while in the EU it has risen,
cycle-by-cycle, from around 2 per cent in the mid-1960s to some 12 per cent
today. Moreover, since 1973, more than four-fifths of the employment growth
in North America has been in the private sector, while in the EU more than
half has been in the public sector.
The European failure has, as the OECD report shows, a host of unpleasant
ramifications:
The EU's male participation rate - the proportion of the working age
population in work - fell from more than 95 per cent in 1960 to below 80 per
cent in 1991, while in the US it declined from just over 90 per cent to
about 85 per cent.
The female participation rate in the EU, at 55 per cent in 1991, is far
below that in North America, where it is close to 70 per cent. The EU rate
has also risen by much less than the North American one since 1960, when the
two were much the same.
At 20.6 per cent in 1993, the EU's youth unemployment rate, was well above
the 13.8 per cent in North America.
And the long-term unemployed - those out of work for more than a year - made
up 42.2 per cent of total EU unemployment in 1992, compared with only 11.2
per cent in North America.
The performance of the EU does look dreadful - and so, indeed, it is. But
relative North American success came at a heavy price: poor performance of
real wages, along with greatly increased pay inequality. Between 1978 and
1993 average US real wages stagnated. But over the same period, German real
wages rose by 18 per cent, French ones rose by 26 per cent (between 1978 and
1992) and British ones rose by 31 per cent.
Not only have average real wages stagnated in the US, but inequality has
considerably increased. In fact, during the 1980s pay-differentials widened
in all the English-speaking industrial countries, while there was no
comparable rise in inequality within continental Europe.
Behind these contrasting developments lies a mixture - one whose precise
composition remains controversial - of two underlying causes: technological
change is the more important; international trade is the more controversial.
The latter consists of shifts in comparative advantage, as the growing
outward-orientation of developing countries generates a significant increase
in the global supply of labour-intensive manufactured products. These two
forces have generated a significant shift in demand from unskilled labour
and towards relatively skilled labour.
The OECD comments in its jobs study that, 'in most countries where relative
wages have been flexible (the United States, Canada, Australia), both the
relative employment and unemployment rates of the unskilled changed little
during the 1980s. In comparatively inflexible Europe, on the other hand,
both relative employment and unemployment rates deteriorated.' But in the
English-speaking countries, where employment has held up fairly well, the
price has been paid in declining relative wages of the unskilled.
The question then is not whether jobs can be created. Obviously, they can.
The challenge is to provide what President Clinton has promised the American
electorate, namely many more 'good jobs'.
Can that be done? Or are the citizens of advanced economies condemned to
choose between more jobs, which may pay less and less, or fewer, but
'better' jobs? Robert Reich, President Clinton's labour secretary, argued at
Detroit, that 'there is a third choice, and that third choice may be to
combine the kind of investments in education and training and apprenticeship
that we find in Europe, with the dynamic labour mobility and flexibility we
find in the US, all encased within macro-economic policies which encourage
growth and jobs'.
How far does such eclecticism - further elaborated (apart from the emphasis
on macro-economic expansion) in the Naples communique - provide the
solution? Improvements in the quality of labour must be important, although
high-quality basic education probably matters quite as much as training.
Improved economic dynamism must matter, too. Yet that depends not just on
deregulation and increased competition, but also on achieving far higher
rates of capital accumulation.
The most attractive example has, in fact, been provided by Japan, which has
historically come closest to secretary Reich's ideal. Japan's unemployment
rate, even after a recession, is only 3 per cent. Between 1978 and 1993,
Japanese real wages rose by 49 per cent. The question for the future is
whether the other industrial countries can manage to replicate some of the
Japanese labour market success - or whether Japan, already afflicted by a
long recession, catches the employment maladies of North America, of Europe,
or even of both.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Industry (18): US
research causes rethink on pay theory - Minimum wages / Edward Balls
examines three studies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once the bugbear of free-market analysts, minimum wages are finally seeking
intellectual respectability. Five years ago most economists would have
agreed with the proposition that minimum wages cost jobs. But in recent
years, a growing body of evidence has accumulated which, taken together,
provides a counter-blast to this conventional wisdom.
Not that conventional economic wisdom has a good track record. Not so long
ago most British economists would have sworn that a devaluation of the
currency would feed through into wage inflation. Even the most devout
advocates of monetary targets are a little more reticent these days in
pushing the predictive powers of their favourite measure.
Nor have policy-makers been inclined to accept the basic implications of
standard economic analysis, and minimum wages are no exception. The US
economy - closer to the classical economic textbook model then most
developed countries - has had a federal minimum wage for decades. And,
within Europe, only the UK has no minimum wage protection at either
national, regional, or sectoral level.
France, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Luxembourg have a statutory minimum
wage, while in Belgium and Greece a national minimum wage is set by
collective bargaining. In Germany, Italy and Denmark, pay minima for
individual sectors are set by binding collective agreements covering a large
proportion of the workforce while, in Ireland, legal minimum rates are set
for certain low-wage sectors such as hotels and catering.
But the minimum wage does appear to be one area where policy is leading
economic research. Anxious to investigate whether increases in minimum wages
really do reduce employment and therefore whether low-wage labour markets do
conform to the standard textbook theory, a distinguished group of US
economists has examined the effects of recent changes in state and federal
minimum wages. Their results have turned conventional wisdom upside down.
For these studies find that low-wage markets do not work like simple markets
on a Saturday morning. Setting a market-clearing price for strawberries is a
fairly straightforward process. If strawberries are plentiful then a
relatively high-price floor will lead to a glut. But the same logic does not
apply to labour markets - notions of fairness, commitment to particular jobs
and information about available alternatives make people a more complicated
commodity.
In fact, the classical assumptions about the labour market - that employers
can easily hire workers and that they can costlessly get all the information
they need about available jobs and wage rates - are almost never met in
practice. When turnover is rapid, and workers are young and inexperienced,
it is quite possible for different workers of the same age and with the same
skills to be paid very different wages, even in the same company. Under
these circumstances, the standard model does not apply.
The US studies, all published by the National Bureau of Economic Research in
Cambridge Massachusetts, are:
Card (1991). The increase in the US federal minimum wage in 1990, the first
for a decade, provided a good natural experiment to test the standard
economic theory. David Card, of Princeton University, examined the effect of
this increase in the federal minimum wage from Dollars 3.35 to Dollars 3.80
in 1990. He compared its impact on states with differing proportions of low
wage workers on the assumption that if the increase in the national minimum
wage reduced employment, then total employment should fall faster in
low-wage states such as Arkansas, compared to richer states such as
Massachusetts. In fact, Card found no significant differences in employment
growth in the following year while employment appeared to grow faster in the
low-wage states.
Katz &amp; Kreuger (1992). The federal minimum wage was again increased in 1991
 -from Dollars 3.80 to Dollars 4.25. Lawrence Katz, of Harvard University,
and Alan Kreuger, then at Princeton, conducted a survey of employment and
wages in 100 Burger King restaurants before and after the increase. Again
they found no evidence that employment fell. In fact, employment appeared to
rise and, more important, by a greater amount in those stores which
previously paid the lowest wages and therefore had to make up the biggest
increases.
Card and Kreuger (1993). The most compelling survey was conducted by
Kreuger, now chief economist at the US Labor Department, in conjunction with
Card. In April 1992, New Jersey increased its minimum wage from Dollars 4.25
to Dollars 5.05, giving it the highest state minimum wage in the US. Card
and Kreuger surveyed 410 fast-food restaurants before and after the change
both in New Jersey and in neighbouring eastern Pennsylvania where the
minimum wage had stayed at Dollars 4.25 an hour. The average starting wage
at fast-food restaurants in New Jersey increased by 10 per cent following
the rise in the minimum wage. By December 1992, full-time equivalent
employment had risen in New Jersey's fast-food restaurants, and fallen in
Pennsylvania. The biggest increases in employment occurred in those New
Jersey stores which were previously paying the lowest wages.
The US evidence is overwhelming: increasing minimum wages to a tolerable
level in low-wage labour markets does not cost jobs, and can even increase
employment. And a recent UK survey tells the same story about the UK wages
council rates. Until their abolition last year, the rates set for particular
wages councils declined steadily in real terms. But a study by Steve Machin
and Alan Manning of the London School of Economics found no evidence of
positive employment effects resulting from this decline. Instead, employment
declined in industries where wage council rates fell sharply.
One result of this growing evidence that minimum wages need not cost jobs
has been a softening of the attitude of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development. In its recent Unemployment report, the OECD
dropped its previous vigorous opposition to minimum wages, warning instead
that too high minimum rates will eventually bite into employment, and that
they cannot be the central plank of any anti-poverty strategy. Most families
living below the poverty line in developed countries are poor because of old
age, unemployment or children rather then low wages.
What is clear, in the modern labour markets, is that minimum wages can be an
effective part of a wider anti-poverty strategy to the extent that they make
the benefit systems work more effectively. The Clinton administration, still
reportedly considering an increase in the federal minimum, has placed more
stress on the Earned Income Tax Credit - a taxable credit to low-wage
working families with children. But, as this year's economic report of the
president argued, the minimum wage floor is necessary to prevent bad
employers from cutting wages and allowing the state to subsidise low pay.
In short, it does appear that a minimum wage can be an effective tool as
part of a broader anti-poverty strategy. Advocates of minimum wages are no
less vociferous than in the past.
But today they have more sophisticated arguments, and a wider body of
evidence, at their disposal.

(17): Customers back in favour - Foreign exchange / Philip Gawith assesses a
change in attitudes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Customers are back in fashion. That is the short message of foreign exchange
markets in 1994.
After a period of extraordinary profits in 1992/93, the focus has now swung
sharply back towards relationships and service. The customer has been
enthusiastically rediscovered, and his patronage is the subject of more keen
competition.
In 1992/93, it was proprietary traders - trading for banks' own account -
who were the hot property in the labour market. Now, the premium attaches to
corporate sales people who have a good set of client relationships.
The catalyst for this shift was the US Federal Reserve's decision to raise
interest rates on February 8. Until then, the foreign exchange markets were
riding the crest of a wave, driven by strong rallies in US and European bond
markets, and the extraordinary volatility surrounding the exchange rate
mechanism (ERM) crisis in Europe.
The downward trend in interest rates, and the one-way bets which the ERM
provided, gave banks and investors the confidence to take large leveraged
positions, and to make huge trading profits.
The decision in August 1993 of the European Union's finance ministers to
widen the ERM's fluctuation margins to 15 per cent around either side of the
system's bilateral rates, from 2.25 per cent, removed one of these trends.
Just as surely, the Fed removed the other when it signalled the turn in the
interest rate cycle. This unleashed fears of rising inflation, causing
enormous dislocation in world bond markets. Yields rose sharply and
investors with large leveraged positions suffered heavy losses. This
dramatic loss of liquidity spilled over into much more cautious
position-taking in the foreign exchange markets.
David Cocker, economist at Chemical Bank in London, comments: 'The lack of
ability of people to make money in the bond markets has meant that
institutional investors have pulled their horns in.'
They were not the only ones. Some of the hedge funds, who figured so
conspicuously in driving markets up, made large losses when they turned.
George Soros, for example, confirmed that funds under his management made a
Dollars 600m loss in a single day - February 14. The proprietary trading
desks at some banks also made large losses. The net effect was that these
investors reduced their exposure considerably. They shortened their trading
horizon, seeking more prices from an interbank market that was increasingly
nervous.
Turnover figures are not available to substantiate the extent to which
liquidity has been withdrawn, but the bulk of anecdotal evidence suggests
that overall volumes, if anything, are slightly lower than in 1993. While
customer business appears to have held up fairly well (as would be expected
 -volatile financial markets do not stop corporates from trading) the level
of discretionary activity - from hedge funds and the proprietary trading
desks of banks - has been much reduced.
The impact on the profits, though, is clear. Comparisons are tricky, because
some banks do not break down their trading income, to show a specific
foreign exchange component. What is evident is that those banks with a
strong customer base suffered less than those with a stronger trading
emphasis. This was especially so during the first quarter, when volatility
was highest. Subsequent trading conditions have been much calmer. Where
profits rose, they did so only by a small margin. Most were lucky to turn in
a flat performance.
If sharp rises in world bond yields provided foreign exchanges with an
unexpected banana skin, the dollar provided another. Indeed, the two fed off
each other. Only days after the Fed raised rates, the failure of President
Clinton and Morihiro Hosokawa, Japanese prime minister at the time, to
broker a trade accord, put the skids under the dollar. Many investors lost
large sums and this put a further liquidity squeeze on the market.
It was not supposed to be this way. At the turn of the year most observers
thought the US economy would outperform its trading rivals, forcing interest
rate differentials to move in its favour. Both trends, it was argued, would
support the dollar, and many pundits saw the dollar appreciating to
DM1.80-DM1.90 by the end of the year, and Y115-120, from DM1.7450 and
Y112.50 at the start of the year.
With the dollar at Y99 and DM1.55 in mid-September (having touched lows of
Y96.80 and DM1.5235 in July), however, those who were bearish on the dollar
had clearly won the day. These analysts stressed that the US's large trade
and current account surpluses, coupled with ongoing capital outflows, were
inimical to a stronger dollar.
Aggravating matters was the long-running trade dispute between Japan and the
US, with the Clinton administration seeking to cut its trade deficit with
Japan by obtaining improved market access. For a long time the
administration allowed the markets to believe that its policy towards the
dollar was at best benign neglect, at worst 'dollar debasement' - talking
the dollar down, the reasoning being that a cheaper dollar would improve US
penetration of Japanese markets.
By mid-year, the administration had changed its tune, and senior officials
were at pains to stress that the US needed a strong dollar. By this time,
however, markets were well and truly spooked by the spectre of rising
interest rates. This cast a pall over US asset markets, and so long as
foreign investors remained chary of buying US assets, fearing higher
interest rates, the dollar had little chance of recovering.
It was the misfortune of most investors and traders that they stood on the
wrong side of the one clear trend - dollar down, yen up. For the rest, the
complaint has been of range-bound, trendless trading. A good example
concerns dollar/sterling, or 'cable', as it is known. In past years the
average move has been 12-15 cents. In 1994, though, the currency has traded
in a 3 to 4 cent range most of the time.
In Europe, the widening of the ERM bands has, ironically, proven a great
success. The product of extreme volatility, it has had the desired effect -
at least from the perspective of governments and central banks - of
stabilising exchange rates. There have been no repeats of the speculative
frenzies which drove sterling and the lira out of the ERM.
One clear trend in European currencies has been for the market to focus on
high deficit countries. Accordingly, the Swedish krona and the Italian lira
have been two of the most volatile currencies. This trend was bolstered by
the re-emergence in September of the debate over a multi-speed Europe. The
fear that some countries might not make it into the mainstream, and hence
would be subject to less exacting financial discipline, caused investors to
resort to safety first habits.
Further afield, exotic currencies remained a growth area as corporates
continued to globalise their activities, and fund managers continued their
pursuit of emerging markets.
Investors, however, are more cautious following some chastening experiences.
Looking ahead, while most market participants are hoping that 1995 will
prove a more fruitful year than 1994, few are expecting a return to the
halcyon days of 1992/93.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Finance and Investment
(16): An economic think tank - OECD / Peter Norman expands on the
abbreviation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For years the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) has seemed to be the shrinking violet among the
international bodies set up after the second world war to manage the global
economy.
With its unmemorable name and awkward abbreviation, it has been easy to
dismiss the OECD as a mere talking shop, tucked away in one of the more
desirable residential areas of Paris.
But this grouping of 25 industrialised nations has acquired a new importance
since the end of the cold war marked the triumph of market-based economics
and gave a new spur to globalisation.
It may lack the financial resources of the World Bank or the tough
prescriptive mandate of the International Monetary Fund. Under the
leadership of Jean-Claude Paye, secretary-general since 1984, it has stayed
out of the public eye to an extent that has almost certainly damaged his
chances of reappointment. Other candidates for the top job have been Donald
Johnston, a Canadian politician, and the former UK chancellor Lord Lawson.
But this year's protracted tussle among member states to fill the post of
OECD secretary-general and the queue of applicant countries for membership
are signs that it has an important role to fill in an increasingly
interdependent world economy.
The OECD defies easy definition. It has often been described as the 'club'
of the industrialised nations. But the expression 'think-tank' gives a
better idea of its purpose. It is, in effect, a research institute serving
economic policy makers. More than 75 per cent of its FFr1.6bn (Dollars 290m)
annual budget is expenditure on personnel and pensions for its 1,900 staff.
About a third are professionals, most of whom are economists.
In a world where knowledge is increasingly seen as the key to economic
prosperity, the OECD has a unique role. Its work involves policy analysis,
gathering statistics and organising meetings. The flood of its publications
reflects only part of its endeavours.
The organisation facilitates the exchange and dissemination of knowledge
among policy-makers. Its secretariat provides non-partisan analysis on a
host of issues ranging from macroeconomic policy to trade, agriculture, the
environment, competition law, international investment, export credits,
education, tourism, taxation, migration, health and the impact of
technological change on society.
It is also one of the few places where officials from member countries can
exchange views without the risk of committing themselves or their
governments in negotiations. This helps clear up misunderstandings which
otherwise would bedevil international relations. OECD committees, meeting
away from the public gaze, have proves to be a good forum for stifling some
of the more stupid preoccupations of member governments that could otherwise
poison negotiations among states.
Its analysis has sometimes played an important part in clearing
international policy logjams. For example, its pioneering work on measuring
the cost of farm subsidies helped the agricultural part of the Uruguay Round
of multilateral trade negotiations to a successful conclusion.
Over the past year, the OECD has been in the headlines rather more than
usual. Mexico joined the organisation, the first new member for 20 years.
The way has been opened for separate negotiations on membership with the
Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. The statement issued after
this year's annual OECD ministerial meeting in June held out the prospect of
South Korea, which already participates in many of the OECD's committees and
activities, becoming a member by the end of 1996.
As a further indication of the organisation's increasingly outward-looking
nature, the OECD agreed in June to step up the flow of economic assistance
to Russia. In particular, it will help develop the legal and institutional
infrastructure that Russia needs for a functioning market economy. It will
offer advice on economic restructuring and reform of Russia's tax and
statistics system as well as carry out a survey of the economy.
The OECD also intends to explore possibilities for co-operation with China
and maintain its policy dialogue with the fast growing, newly
industrialising nations of Asia and Latin America.
Bulgaria, Romania and Slovenia have asked for policy advice and the
organisation may help the Baltic states. Indeed, the organisation's work on
eastern and central Europe has expanded to such an extent that it accounts
for 10 per cent of its activities, as measured by the budget, compared with
nothing four years ago.
These ties testify to the high value placed on the OECD's output. The
organisation's ability to produce high quality economic analysis of value to
its varied member states was further highlighted this year in its 'Jobs
Study'.
Commissioned by governments in 1992, this underscored how dangerous
unemployment is for the future welfare of industrialised societies. To
tackle the crisis of 35m unemployed in the industrialised world, it provided
a compendium of 60 detailed policy recommendations to help member states
cope with economic change.
However, applying the lessons of the 'Jobs Study' in individual member
states will, officials say, be a 'huge piece of work'. It will be a further
strain on already limited resources which are having to cover a wide-ranging
programme of work.

(14): The art of staying ahead is adaptation - Competitiveness / Frances
Williams takes a quizzical look at the IMD report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
'Damned if you do and damned if you don't' just about sums up the gloomy
message for the industrialised world of this year's World Competitiveness
Report issued by the Swiss-based International Institute for Management
Development (IMD) and the World Economic Forum.
Its theme is that countries as well as companies must accept the need for
constant change and adaptation to stay ahead of rivals in world markets, in
a never-ending quest for global competitiveness.
Many of those changes are going to be painful, especially for European
nations which are finding it increasingly difficult to support high living
standards and social benefits.
Prof Stephane Garelli, head of the World Competitiveness Project at IMD,
believes the west is in a bind. If a country loses competitiveness, it will
not be able to afford an affluent lifestyle.
But to compete effectively, it may have to jettison that lifestyle anyway.
Little wonder that a strong body of opinion in industrialised countries
holds that 'competitiveness is unfair'.
Prof Garelli's own view is that 'competitiveness is not unfair but it is
rough'. It is also inescapable; markets worldwide are being blasted open by
a series of legislative, technological and management revolutions, most
notably the Uruguay Round global trade agreements, developments in
communications and data transmission, and the spread of multinationals.
One consequence of the race for competitiveness will be a shift of jobs to
the third world, Prof Garelli says. 'The opening of world markets and the
harmonisation of international business rules, through agreements such as
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), puts enormous pressure on
business activities to relocate.'
In the past 10 years, a labour force of some 1,200m people has become
reachable in the developing countries, at an average cost of less than
Dollars 2 an hour.
The industrialised nations at present employ 350m people paid an average
hourly wage of Dollars 18.
'European labour costs are four times as high as in East Asia but European
workers are not four times as productive,' says Prof Garelli, pointing out
that freer trade and technological advances now permit companies to farm out
discrete bits of the production process to wherever seems most profitable.
'Today, an outflow of manufacturing operations from western economies seems
inevitable.'
Even more gloomily, Prof Garelli predicts a similar exodus of white-collar
jobs. There are already some straws in the wind. Swissair, Switzerland's
national airline, has transferred much of its accounts work to Bombay.
American banks use Ireland for processing financial data. India and the
Philippines have flourishing software industries.
Unemployment in industrialised countries will thus remain high, Prof Garelli
says. Moreover, he believes that the incomes of a good part of the workforce
may fall.
Over the past decade or so, European pay levels have risen at the expense of
jobs, while the US has created jobs at the cost of falling real wages. But
both paths have led to stagnation or even declines in the purchasing power
of lower-income households.
Prof Garelli sees this trend extending to the middle classes, as Europe
follows the US in greater wage flexibility and governments in both the US
and Europe are forced to raise taxes to reduce ballooning budget deficits.
If so, 'we shall soon see the first generation since the war to have the
doubtful privilege of becoming poorer than their parents'.
Prof Garelli admits that some parts of the west's 'value system' actually
contribute to competitiveness - high education standards, for instance, or a
corporate culture that reinforces employee commitment to the company.
Indeed, the US - which regained top place in the competitiveness league
table this year after an eight-year reign by Japan - is warned that poor
secondary education and 'work attitudes' could if left untackled lead to
long-term decline.
But, he argues, the industrialised countries and especially Europe have a
value system that costs them more than their present levels of
competitiveness can support. As a result, most governments are running
unsustainably high budget deficits.
Fortunately, there are some indications that Prof Garelli's scenario may be
too pessimistic.
The World Competitiveness Report itself places 16 OECD members among the top
20 competitive nations. Germany and Switzerland, with the highest labour
costs in the world, come fifth and sixth.
This is because, as the report recognises, competitiveness is a complex
thing which does not depend simply on relative labour costs.
'Soft' factors such as a skilled labour force, high quality communications
and transport infrastructure, government policies, research capabilities and
so on all count for more and more as countries move up the development
ladder.
An analysis of the impact of multinationals on world employment by the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) seems to bear
this out. Its recent World Investment Report argued that, while
multinationals were ever more active, relatively few jobs are switched from
the West to developing countries.
Most overseas investment, it says, is designed to exploit natural resources
and new markets rather than labour-cost differentials (though there are
important exceptions such as electronics).
In this context, companies are increasingly placing emphasis on an educated,
committed workforce and good infrastructure.
The World Competitiveness Report also defines competitiveness in a way
designed to produce winners and losers: 'World competi-tiveness is the
ability of a country or a company to, proportionally, generate more wealth
than its competitors in world markets.' If some countries move up the table,
others must move down.
The OECD, by contrast, defines competitiveness in a way that allows everyone
to win: 'Competitiveness is the degree to which a country can, under free
and fair market conditions, produce goods and services which meet the test
of international markets, while simultaneously maintaining and expanding the
real incomes of its people over the long term.'
Post-war experience suggests the OECD's definition may be nearer the mark.
Japan and the newly industrialising countries of East Asia have emerged as
world-class competitors at the same time as the west has grown richer. The
125 nations that participated in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks
certainly did so in the belief that expanding markets worldwide provide
opportunities for all.

(15): Popularity of MBAs wavers - Business schools, are their courses worth
it?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the toughest puzzles facing a business school student is whether it
is worth taking the course in the first place. The answer may well be no,
many have suggested; unfortunately the skills to work that out may be
acquired too late to shape the student's decision.
The popularity of the MBA qualification soared in the US, UK and continental
Europe in the second half of the 1980s. But in the past few years,
prospective students and employers have increasingly questioned whether an
MBA is worth acquiring. Schools report that growth in applications in the
past three years has slowed sharply, or in some cases fallen, although the
range of types of courses and starting dates prevents precise comparison of
figures.
The change in attitude has occurred partly because the theories of corporate
strategy promoted by many of the schools, such as globalisation, have
themselves come under scrutiny.
At the same time, businesses have taken a closer look at whether it is worth
their while hiring outside management consultants. Consultants have
traditionally been among the keenest sponsors of students - paying the
course fees of selected staff members - and among the keenest recruiters of
business school graduates. European business schools now suggest that the
increasing pressures on consultancy groups' margins have undermined their
willingness to back students.
But much of the criticism of the courses has been prompted by their cost.
The classic two-year full-time MBA course in a US business school can easily
run to Dollars 100,000, taking loss of salary into account. In an analysis
of US courses published this summer, Professor Ronald Yeaple, from the US's
University of Rochester business school, argues that unless students
attended one of the top two dozen schools, the investment would probably not
pay off.
That is because recession has diminished the immediate returns on the
investment, while increasing the risk of surrendering a salaried job.
According to Roger McCormick of the UK's Association of MBAs (AMBA), 'salary
enhancement for doing an MBA has fallen'. Instead of expecting to double
their salaries on leaving business school, MBAs should think in terms of
better long-term prospects for promotion, he says.
In response to those concerns, many business schools have moved fast to
offer a wider range of courses. In particular, they offer more courses which
will allow someone to keep paid employment. According to Mr McCormick 'the
image of the job-hopping MBA, if it ever was true, has subsided'.
Precise UK figures are hard to establish, but AMBA reckons that in the
1993-4 academic year full-time MBAs make up a third of the 9,800 new places
and part-time MBAs 31 per cent. The balance - 36 per cent - is made up by
the increasingly popular 'distance learning', where students are sent books
and other materials by the school, and send back their completed work. These
courses, which can take up to seven years to complete, 'have assumed
extraordinary prominence', AMBA says.
At the same time as this evolution in the courses' structure, the range of
subjects offered has broadened. To reflect the growing complexity of
business life, schools have added more advanced lessons in corporate finance
and accountancy, as well as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Topics such as leadership and communication skills, for example, have also
become popular, as have ethics, environment and business ethics.
That broadening, however, has given schools a new problem: how to maintain
depth and academic rigour, while covering all the topics students expect to
learn. The solution many have adopted is to allow students to specialise,
picking their own portfolio of subjects. But employers sifting through job
applications now fear that it may become harder to know what expertise is
implied by the MBA qualification.
However, the increased flexibility of courses has allowed a wider range of
students to apply for MBAs, schools in many countries suggest. The heavy
representation from financial services and management consultancy, which was
marked in the 1980s, has diminished, many report. In the UK, interest from
those sectors is concentrated in London and southern England. Increasingly,
however, schools are receiving applications from the public services; many
from the National Health Service and, occasionally, some from the police
force.
By broadening their appeal, and finding ways of reducing the cost to
students of taking these courses, business schools may well have found a way
of stemming the threats to their appeal. They may also persuade students
that the qualification represents a good return on investment.
But it is not just students who have become averse to risk; the recession,
and unhappy experiences with acquisitions in the 1980s, have made many
company executives cautious about expansion. The business schools may then
also have to make changes to some of the theories of corporate strategy
taught in their courses to sustain the long-term demand for their graduates'
services.

(13): Golden rules are difficult to apply - Business ethics / The subject
has blossomed in the wake of corporate scandals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the most flourishing minor industries of the world is known as
business ethics. The subject has blossomed since the mid-1980s in the wake
of a number of corporate scandals. Some 500 business ethics courses are said
to be available in the US and the subject is taught in 90 per cent of US
business schools. Europe's first business ethics publication was, no one
should be surprised, in Italian. The spirit of the subject is captured by an
Economist headline 'How to be Ethical, and Still Come Top'.
John Kay, himself a professor of business economics, has remarked: 'If
Aristotle, John Stuart Mill and GE Moore could not sort out ethical problems
once and for all, it is unlikely that today's business gurus can solve them
with a few trite phrases. But untroubled by these concerns, they go on
earning more for a single lecture than Aristotle, Mill and Moore were paid
in their entire lifetime.'
In the last resort, however, business ethics is not a real subject, as
distinct from ethics generally. Some philosophers make a distinction between
morality itself, which concerns how we should behave, and ethics, which they
see as a more abstract analysis of the language of moral discourse. In
ordinary language ethics is used to cover both aspects.
In this sense there is only ethics and its application to different spheres.
Business, medicine, politics and law all throw up their special problems;
but whatever our basic morality, it should apply to all these fields as well
as personal behaviour.
Business ethics has become popular because the complexity of modern business
makes it difficult to rely on just a few well-cherished rules. For instance,
is the use of insider information a 'victimless crime', or does it do real
harm to the interests of others? The problems arise in the economic analysis
of consequences. Where there are, however, genuine clashes between different
values, no course in business ethics will solve the resulting dilemmas.
A frequent business conundrum concerns bribery. A business executive may be
strongly opposed to the practice; but if he disdains a bribe from some
overseas government official, his competitors may obtain a lucrative order.
This dilemma is but a particular instance of the difficulty of applying the
golden rule 'Do unto others as you would have them do unto you' when others
do not observe it. In this case the practice which you would like to see
observed is: don't give or take bribes. But what do you do if others will
not follow? Become a martyr; or do as others do, even though you are
endorsing a pernicious practice?
Those who are genuinely interested in moral reasoning rather than striking
attitudes will not stop there. The maxim against bribery is a lower level
rule of everyday morality, not a final principle. We think that human
welfare would be greater in a world without bribery.
But either to say 'Never take bribes though the heavens fall' or 'Grow up
and do what others do' is equally an evasion. Circumstances need to be
examined, including the validity of the maxim itself. In the would-be
command Soviet economy the only way of matching supplies to requirements was
by a series of side payments and unofficial deals between officials in state
enterprises. In these conditions it may have been a duty to encourage such
payments to help Soviet citizens lead a slightly less impoverished life.
The problems are as great in post-Communist Russia. The journal Business
Ethics cites in its January 1994 issue an explanation of why young people
are in great professional demand in Russia today: 'Older people have an
ethics problem. By that, I mean they have ethics. To survive, I can break a
law if I need to and if the risks aren't too large. Older people wouldn't
even think in such a way.'
Consequentialist philosophers, who believe that rules should be judged by
their effect on human or other valued concerns, would be less inclined to
condemn this young man out of hand than deontologists, who believe that
rules should be observed though the heavens fall. It must be said, however,
that most published codes of business ethics are banal in the extreme and
give little guide either way.
One of the few books on business ethics which has something to say is Just
Business by Elaine Sternberg published this year (Little, Brown, Dollars
20). The author was a lecturer in philosophy at the London School of
Economics before spending 14 years as an investment banker and is now
running her own consultancy.
Dr Sternberg has two theses. First, the sole task of business is to maximise
the long-term value of the owners' stake by selling goods and services. It
is not to exercise 'social responsibility' for crime prevention, urban
decay, the education of the young or the provision of managerial advice to
government. Thus she has no time for fashionable ideas such as 'stakeholder
theory' in which workers, customers and suppliers count equally with
shareholders.
Nevertheless, her attitude is far removed from the 'devil take the hindmost,
anything goes' attitude. For her second main thesis is to insist that
everyone in business has a duty to behave ethically. The ethics show
themselves in the means used to achieve business objectives, and not in
deviating from them for supposedly worthwhile goals.
Ethical methods involve 'ordinary decency', which she divides into honesty,
fairness, refraining from coercion and physical violence, and respecting the
law. By fairness she has in mind, for instance, not deliberately misleading
people or building up false expectations.
The main problem with the book relates to philosophical foundations on which
human beings will always differ. Dr Sternberg believes that ethics is an
objective discipline, as knowable as physics, and the same for everyone,
everywhere. She has no time for any degree of relativism or subjectivism.
This is linked with her belief - following Aristotle - that all activities
and objects have essential natures revealed by careful definition.
These theoretical matters affect the business practitioner. To take one
example: Dr Sternberg's objection to 'social responsibility' is that it
misunderstands the nature of business. Her view of business is the
mainstream Anglo-American one in which someone who wants to use corporate
assets for the benefit of people other than shareholders is guilty of
misappropriation, unless a clear prior warning is given.
But suppose that law and practice are different? In Japan and parts of
Europe corporate directors may be in part responsible to other
'stakeholders'; and there are non-profit making corporations in all
countries. The author's response is that such corporations are not true
businesses. The question at issue, however, is whether human needs are
better served by maximising equity value or by some variant of the
stakeholder approach. This is a matter of political economy, not
definitions.
Behind the arguments of business ethics is the age-old debate about whether
or not a businessman benefits his followers most by maximising profits. The
English 18th century evangelist and non-conformist, John Wesley, had three
maxims: Gain all you can (honestly, of course), Save all you can, Give all
you can.
A clever undergraduate can show that these maxims are imperfect. But are
they as good as we are likely to get in an imperfect world or can we improve
them without platitude or self-defeating complication?
A businessman absorbed by this question would have to spend so long studying
philosophy, political economy, history and (above all) human nature that he
would have no time for his proper metier. I have previously suggested that
the best short cut might be the study of role models, that is of how
specific admired and successful individuals coped with the problems. This
would have to be done in a modern idiom, not just copying Samuel Smiles. Who
will rise to the challenge?
Samuel Brittan considers these matters in much greater depth in his book
Capitalism with A Human Face, Edward Elgar (forthcoming).

(12): Professionals wrong-footed by the Fed - Bond markets / Many traders
erroneously expected the bull run to continue into 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The embarrassing admission last month by HSBC, the international banking
group which owns Midland Bank, that it lost Pounds 123m on bond and interest
rate-related trading in the first half of 1994 shows just how wrong the
professionals have been about the direction of bond markets this year.
After raking in huge profits during last year's phenomenal bull run, many
traders clearly expected their luck to continue into 1994. But they were
wrong-footed by the US Federal Reserve's decision in February to nip
inflation in the bud by raising short-term interest rates.
The Fed has underlined its determination to keep inflation in check by
raising interest rates several times since then. By mid-August, the federal
funds rate, which banks charge each other on overnight balances, had risen
to 4.75 per cent from around 3 per cent at the start of the year.
Despite the Fed's pre-emptive strikes, the market still believes that
further rate rises are necessary to effectively cap inflation in the US and
to bring about the required slowing of economic growth. For example, J P
Morgan expects the federal funds' rate to peak at 7 per cent next year, up
from a previous forecast of 6 per cent, three percentage points above its
projected 4 per cent inflation rate for 1995.
Having got the direction of the US market wrong, many investors had hoped to
make up for those losses by buying European government bonds in the belief
that a further fall in continental interest rates was likely. But the
so-called 'decoupling' theory, whereby European interest rates would fall
independently of the rise in US rates, has not come true.
Although inflation has hit the lowest level for a quarter of a century in
several European countries, higher commodity prices and
stronger-than-expected economic growth have hampered hopes of a further fall
in interest rates this year. As a result, many European government bond
markets have failed to live up to the expectations which analysts held at
the start of the year.
According to the J P Morgan government bond index, the UK government bond
market recorded a negative return of 8.7 per cent in local currency terms
from January to August, while Germany saw a negative return of 3 per cent.
The worst performer was Sweden with a negative return of 9.5 per cent.
The depth of the fall in European bond markets this year has been compounded
by the severe erosion of the traditionally dominant position of long-term
institutional investors by previously-unknown US and off-shore hedge funds -
leveraged pools of private money which were highly geared in the futures
markets. The hedge funds, along with the proprietary traders at leading
banks, bought heavily into European bond markets at the end of last year and
the beginning of this year but when it became clear that their bets were
going badly wrong, they had no option but to sell their holdings quickly
because of their highly-borrowed positions.
'Institutional investors do not have any influence over the direction of
bond markets any more, they are dominated by the short-term movements of
traders,' said David Shaw, director of strategy at Legal &amp; General
Investment Management.
The sidelining of the institutions, baffled by the free fall in the markets
which appeared to have nothing to do with economic fundamentals, has caused
market liquidity to contract sharply. In such trading conditions, even the
lightest of sell orders can send prices into a tailspin.
August was a particularly gruelling month for European bond markets as the
seasonal drop in trading volume further reduced the markets' capacity to
cope with nasty surprises. For example, when Sweden and Italy unexpectedly
raised their interest rates on August 12, the thin volume in the cash and
futures market caused the impact on European markets to be far more severe
than was justified.
Although the Swedish and Italian central banks' actions were widely
interpreted to have been motivated by domestic concerns - primarily to
galvanise their governments into tackling their large budget deficits and to
defend their respective currencies - they inevitably raised fears that
continental interest rates had reached their trough and were now heading
upwards.
Attention has inevitably turned to Germany, where many analysts had expected
the Bundesbank to cut the discount rate at least once more this year. But
the plentiful signs that the German economy has been growing strongly in
recent months and that the downward trend in inflation is slowing have
prompted forecasters to increase their projections.
For example, both Deutsche Bank and Swiss Bank Corporation revised their
12-month forecasts upwards on 10-year bund yields, by 30 basis points to 7
per cent and by 50 basis points to 6.25 per cent respectively.
Because of the extreme nervousness of the market, the Bundesbank decided not
to be precipitate on the interest rate front when it met in August after its
four-week summer break. It left leading interest rates alone and extended
its fixed rate of 4.85 per cent for the next two repurchase agreements. The
market is very sensitive to changes in these so-called repos which they see
as indicators of the Bundesbank's intentions towards leading interest rates.
But given the heavy issuance programme ahead of the Bundesbank, and the
approach of the federal elections in October, it will soon have to come off
the fence.
One market about which analysts are becoming increasingly optimistic is the
UK government bond (gilts) market. As many expected the Bank of England in
mid-September raised the base rate by half a percentage point to 5 3/4 per
cent, to keep the lid on inflation. However, they still believe that gilts
have the ability to outperform their US and German counterparts from now
until the end of the year.
Simon Briscoe at SG Warburg believes that the recent release of
second-quarter GDP numbers, which show no inflation, weaker consumer demand
and a shift to exports, are just about the perfect set of data for the
market. The better-than-expected inflation and wage data have prompted
Kleinwort Benson to cut its end-year 10-year gilt yield projection from 9.25
per cent to 8.5 per cent.

In the past 10 years, innovation in the field of derivatives trading has
transformed the nature of the world's financial markets. But in recent years
the potential dangers associated with derivatives have attracted the glare
of regulatory attention and the threat of restrictive legislation.
Worrying political news in Tokyo now affects instantly financial markets
around the world, and traders and institutional investors adjust their
portfolios accordingly in a matter of moments. Their ability to do so
results at least in part from the creation of a range of complex and
not-so-complex financial instruments known as derivatives (because they
derive their value from the underlying markets on which they are based).
A number of other developments have facilitated the financial revolution
which has brought the derivatives markets to the fore. First, the impact of
the derivatives markets was exaggerated by the wave of deregulation which
characterised the 1980s.
As the barriers between markets, which had effectively forced investors to
focus largely on their limited domestic sectors, were removed, large
institutions began to focus increasingly on the investment opportunities
available in new, overseas markets. The result was the creation of a far
more international market place. This was also facilitated by technological
developments, which gave dealers access to powerful personal computers on
which they could learn of the latest economic data, calculate exposure,
execute trades, and so on.
But international investors quickly became wary of the pitfalls of entering
new markets, the most important of which was lack of liquidity. Investors
found that while they might be able to buy stock easily enough, it could
prove harder to sell it, if the market turned around.
Futures markets had already existed for some time in the US, but it was the
foundation of Liffe (the London International Financial Futures &amp; Options
Exchange) in 1982 which marked the start of European futures trading. Liffe
and other European exchanges now offer a broad array of financial futures
and options contracts based on Europe's main short-term interest rates,
bonds and stock indices. These allow traders and investors to switch their
exposure from one market to another in a matter of moments.
In most of the world's securities markets, the liquidity of the futures
market now substantially exceeds the liquidity of the underlying market. For
example, volume in FT-SE 100 index futures on Liffe is two and a half times
the stock market's turnover.
This, however, has led to concern among market supervisors that derivatives
are destabilising financial markets - in other words, that the tail is
wagging the dog. Although accusations flew in the wake of the 1987 stock
market crash and also during the turmoil in the bond markets after the US
authorities raised interest rates in February, there is little in the way of
concrete evidence.
In fact, most studies have shown the opposite. For example, a study in
December by Gary Robinson of the Bank of England on the effect of
derivatives on the London stock market concluded that 'futures trading has
been associated with a significant reduction in volatility - around 17 per
cent'.
In addition to the futures and options contracts traded on the world's
futures exchanges, an over-the-counter (OTC) market in derivative
instruments such as swaps has grown up. According to the International Swaps
and Derivatives Association, the notional amount of OTC swaps outstanding
stood at Dollars 8,500bn, at the end of 1993.
It is the OTC market which has been the forum for the greatest innovation,
developing exotic products such as knock-out options, which reduce the cost
to the end user. Such instruments are now widely used by companies to manage
risk on their treasury side, but they are not without danger.
There has been a list of casualties, such as Allied-Lyons, which lost around
Pounds 150m several years ago, when currency options positions went awry,
and Germany's Metallgesellschaft, which had to be rescued by its banks when
a trading subsidiary incurred estimated losses of Dollars 1bn on oil
derivatives.
Meanwhile, Procter &amp; Gamble recently threatened legal action against Bankers
Trust, after it lost Dollars 100m on swaps sold by Bankers Trust. Although
the threat has so far come to nothing, the notion that banks may be
marketing swaps and other tools in an irresponsible manner could prove a
damaging one.
These blotches of red ink have attracted considerable scrutiny from
regulators, many of whom have expressed concern about the potential knock-on
effects of problems in derivatives on other markets, or on the integrity of
the financial system as a whole.
Although a number of recent reports by regulatory authorities such as the
Bank of England have adopted a fairly conciliatory tone, there are still
calls for regulators to tighten up on derivatives use, or to force greater
disclosure.
Moves towards a tougher legislative environment in the US, where derivatives
have become something of a political issue, are causing some nervousness
within the industry.
The industry itself has made some effort to put its house in order, by
tightening standards of internal control. A report by the Group of Thirty, a
financial think-tank, on derivatives in 1993 set strict guidelines. Further,
US banks such as Citibank have led the way in giving fuller details of their
derivatives exposure.
The latest signs, though, are that restrictive legislation or regulation is
likely to be averted. First, regulators are developing a greater
understanding of the techniques involved in derivatives, and appear to be
adapting their approach accordingly. Although the playing field is far from
even, efforts are being made to move towards more consistent regulatory
treatment.
'People are coming to realise that (derivatives trading techniques) are very
well founded in some very sensible theory,' said Charles Taylor, executive
director of the Group of Thirty, whereas banking practice has grown up
around certain assumptions and has often proved rather unsatisfactory.

(10): Bretton Woods twins rethink their roles - World Bank and International
Monetary Fund / After 50 years, changes are afoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Strolling past the downtown Washington offices of the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund, the casual passer-by might be forgiven for
thinking that both institutions had succumbed to an assault from the '50
Years Is Enough' campaign, a coalition of environmental and development
groups lobbying for radical changes in the structures set up at the Bretton
Woods meetings half a century ago.
But although activists from Greenpeace, the environmental group, abseiled
down the side of the World Bank building to unfurl a protest banner, the
gaping holes in front of each building are self-inflicted: the World Bank
has knocked down one of the oldest of its cluster of offices to build new
premises, while the Fund has at last bought out and destroyed the small
church that nestled in its shadow for years.
Although the vocal campaigners of '50 Years Is Enough' have made little dent
on the objects of their attack, the two institutions have been rethinking
and reworking their roles and their structures as they approach the 50th
anniversary of their founding.
At the World Bank, much of the re-orientation springs from the Wapenhans
report, a 1992 study headed by a former Bank vice-president, which found an
alarming deterioration in the quality of the loan portfolio, and suggested
changes to the institutional culture to shift the focus away from making new
loans and towards making sure that projects were properly followed through.
A series of measures has been adopted with the aim of putting the stress on
better implementation: reviews of the entire portfolio of projects within
each borrowing country have been instituted; greater efforts have been made
to improve the 'quality at entry' of projects by involving people with a
stake in the outcome from the very start of loan discussions; and the
message has been passed down to bank staff that they must spend more of
their energies on supervising the projects they have worked on.
Lower level managers say that there has been a change in the kind of
projects that win favour: projects to be carried out largely by long-term
expatriates have almost disappeared, and each project must demonstrate that
it does something to build the capacity of the borrower country to do things
on its own.
Large infrastructure loans such as dams and ports have also dwindled -
though those that remain take up a disproportionate amount of Bank staff
time, because of the opposition they invariably arouse from
environmentalists - and more loans are now targeted on social programmes
such as education, health and the advancement of women.
At the same time, the 50th anniversary, although a somewhat artificial
watershed, has provided a useful occasion for rethinking the Bank's
purposes.
One clear outcome of this reflection is a new emphasis on the private
sector. The private sector's importance in economic development has been an
article of faith for some years now, but the World Bank, headed by Lewis
Preston, is in a difficult position. It has a subsidiary, the International
Finance Corporation, engaged in private sector projects, but is not itself
allowed to lend to anything but a government institution. This means that
the World Bank may encourage a country to privatise its railways or its
banks, but once the country does so, the Bank can no longer lend to them.
Nevertheless, senior Bank staff have over the years rethought what they can
do to help provide the right conditions for the private sector to flourish
in developing countries.
'The Bank, being dominated by economists, has tended to think you can create
an enabling environment for the private sector by simply changing the
policies. It turns out not to be that simple,' says Joseph Wood,
vice-president of the south Asia division, pointing to the need for
structures such as an adequate legal system.
The IMF, on the other hand, has faced the criticism that it is trying to do
the work of its sister institution by taking on more of a development role.
'The Commission believes that the IMF should focus on the international
monetary system and macroeconomic adjustment issues, and avoid duplicating
functions of the World Bank Group,' was the conclusion of an influential
Bretton Woods commission convened by Paul Volcker, former chairman of the US
Federal Reserve Board.
The Fund no longer has to lend to the western industrialised countries - as
it once had to do to bail out the UK - and it has in recent years adapted
its loan facilities to make money more readily available not only to the
poorest countries of the developing world but also to the countries of
eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union in their transition from central
planning to a market economy.
The IMF this year won new money for its Enhanced Structural Adjustment
Facility (ESAF), which lends money at nominal interest rates to the very
poorest countries, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa.
And last year, the Fund created the Systemic Transformation Facility,
designed to make money available to Russia and other economies in transition
before they were able to qualify for the more strictly conditional financing
of a traditional IMF standby loan.
Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, strongly defends his
institution's role in these areas.
'We shall not get out of the aid business because we are not in it. But we
shall continue to give confidence to members by making the general resources
of the Fund temporarily available to them under adequate safeguards,' he
said in a speech to Mr Volcker's Bretton Woods Commission, pointing out that
this was one of the purposes set out in the IMF's founding articles.
Mr Camdessus would welcome a chance to follow the Commission's advice that
the Fund should play a central role in stronger co-ordination of economic
policies around the world. He recognises, however, that the willingness of
the leading industrial countries to co-operate in placing themselves under
more rigorous surveillance by the Fund is 'still somewhat embryonic'.
But although both the Fund and the Bank have made efforts to evolve and
adapt themselves to new circumstances, both remain, in a variety of trifling
and not so trifling respects, islands of self-absorption in Washington.
Both have cut back to some extent on their lavish lifestyles. First class
air travel is now largely banned, though business class is still the norm,
and officials do now at least consider the cost when examining a new
proposal. One senior IMF official even proposed profiting from the building
demolition work by renting out the wrecking ball to critical
environmentalist groups.
But cost-consciousness is still less deeply ingrained than some spending
habits. When one IMF circular suggested departments could save money by
using an airline's offer to upgrade passengers with full-fare economy class
tickets to business class, the staff association protested vigorously.
Frank Potter, a Canadian who served until recently as an executive director
on the World Bank's board, says that 'a long history of orchestrated
increments to the benefits package, never egregious but always at the limit
of tolerance, has led to a structure in which no single benefit is
outrageous but which in the aggregate amounts to a cost burden which no
private institution I know of could afford.
'A Bretton Woods secretary can earn more than ministers in most Bretton
Woods countries, yet despite such high salaries there is subsidised parking,
subsidised language training, subsidised day care, subsidised spousal travel
on missions (never in economy class), subsidised home leave for the family,
subsidised private schools for the children (but only to age 25), and so on
and so on.'
Some of this reflects serious disagreements between member countries over
the need for such benefits. Many executive directors from Latin America and
Africa argue that benefits such as first-class air travel are absolutely
necessary to attract talented staff from their countries.
'There is an inverse relationship between per capita income and the need to
be seen to be consuming conspicuously,' retorts a western executive
director.
Although the failings of the World Bank and the IMF in these respects pale
into insignificance against the shortcomings of some of the regional
development banks, notably the African Development Bank, there is a danger
in being inadequately responsive to the concerns of the shareholder
countries which provide the money for the Fund's ESAF or the World Bank's
International Development Association, which also provides concessional
finance to the poorest countries. Aid budgets in all these donor countries
are under pressure, and individual aid ministries have a growing incentive
to keep money for their own bilateral operations. The Bank and the Fund,
therefore, face increasing pressure to prove that they are, in fact, a
bargain for their shareholders.

(8): Billion-dollar man the money markets fear - Profile / George Soros
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
George Soros is variously known as 'the man who broke the Bank of England',
'the JP Morgan of our time', and 'the world's highest paid businessman'
(last year, he reportedly earned more than Dollars 1bn).
Yet, whatever the sobriquet, the 64-year-old, Hungarian-born financier is
indisputably the most prominent professional investor of the late 20th
century. He is also one of this century's most successful.
His Quantum Group of hedge funds controls about Dollars 12bn, which Mr Soros
and his money managers invest in a wide array of markets, currencies and
securities. In the past 10 years, the funds, and their founder, have made an
enormous amount of money. At the same time, Mr Soros has forged a reputation
as an extraordinary philanthropist, donating hundreds of millions of dollars
of his own money to a variety of causes, most notably the rebuilding of
eastern Europe's shattered economies.
Mr Soros's best-known triumph is probably the Dollars 1bn profit he made in
a few weeks in 1992 by successfully anticipating a massive devaluation in
sterling. It was his short-selling of the pound which helped contribute
toward a huge plunge in the value of the UK currency, and its eventual
withdrawal from the European exchange rate mechanism. His funds also enjoyed
substantial gains last year after Quantum made more correct bets on world
bond and currency markets, bets that enabled the funds to report a near-70
per cent return to investors in 1993, the best year in an extended period in
which Mr Soros has earned for his investors average annual returns of around
40 per cent.
Some of those gains, however, have since been eroded by losses incurred this
year, due mostly to the rapid rise in international interest rates, and the
sharp deterioration in the value of the US dollar against the Japanese yen.
Losses on yen positions in February alone cost Quantum Dollars 600m.
While the recent losses do not match Mr Soros's most fabled setback - the
Dollars 800m he lost during the October 1987 stock market crash - they did
bring to an end a long run of successes, and demonstrated that even the most
experienced and astute of investors can be caught out by seismic shifts in
global financial markets.
That does not mean, however, that the influence of Mr Soros, and his funds,
has been waning. Quantum still commands a vast amount of capital which, if
invested heavily in one place, can have a dramatic effect upon the price of
a particular currency or market. Many investors still hang on his every
word, and central bankers know to fear the power of Mr Soros's huge, often
aggressive, funds.
Last year, for example, Quantum made a series of investments that made it
clear Mr Soros was betting on a rally in the price of gold. The
pronouncement was enough on its own to trigger a surge in the gold price.
Similarly, when he unveiled plans to invest in the stricken British property
market, the value of property shares on the London stock market jumped by 6
per cent, prompting some observers to call the end of the slump in British
property prices.
Although Mr Soros courts publicity when it comes to his charitable work in
eastern Europe and elsewhere, details about his funds' trading strategies
have traditionally been scarce. However, this April, after Mr Soros appeared
before a Congressional hearing on hedge funds, one of his associates
revealed that typically about 60 per cent of the Quantum funds are invested
in individual stocks, another 20 per cent is used to make big trading bets
on the direction of global interest rates and currencies, and the final 20
per cent is kept in highly conservative instruments, such as US government
securities and bank deposits.
It is the 20 per cent employed in 'macro' trading strategies that earns Mr
Soros and Quantum all the attention: partly because the funds borrow heavily
against the value of their assets to leverage billions of dollars into even
greater billions, and partly because the strategies the funds employ often
involve huge gambles on short-term movements in currencies and interest
rates, gambles that can sometimes - as in September 1992 - embroil financial
markets and leave central banks and economic policy-makers nursing bruises.
Yet, Mr Soros increasingly appears to be distancing himself from the
day-to-day running of the Quantum funds, which he leaves to money managers
such as his number two, Stanley Druckenmiller. Mr Soros prefers, instead, to
devote more of his time to philanthropic activities.
Whether his absence will substantially affect the performance of the Quantum
group remains to be seen, but Mr Soros knows that his ability to engage in
good works depends upon his ability to make money, so it is unlikely that he
will stray too far from the business of hedge fund management.

(6): Poised to stay the course - Emerging markets are heading for another
important year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If 1993 was the crucial year when emerging markets finally broke through
into the big-time global investment scene, 1994 could prove to be another
important year in which they will consolidate their position in much more
difficult circumstances, and show they have staying power.
Last year's huge net flows into emerging equity markets - some Dollars 55bn
according to Baring Securities - are unlikely to be repeated this time,
still less the average rate of return of some 70 per cent. But according to
Barings a still very substantial Dollars 30bn-plus (the second-largest
annual total) is likely to flow into the emerging markets this year.
And after setbacks early in 1994 for many individual country markets the
global emerging markets indices have recently moved back into positive
territory. Earlier this month, for instance, the International Finance
Corporation's Composite Index was showing a gain of some 2 per cent on the
year so far, while Baring's World Index was up 10 per cent (expressed in
dollars in both cases).
Thus emerging market equities were rather less volatile than bonds, which
have proved to be highly vulnerable to the jump in US Treasury bond yields.
Last year US institutions were chasing so-called Brady bonds - paper
resulting from country debt restructurings - to improve on the low yields on
US Treasuries. This year, not only have Brady yields risen but the spreads
over Treasuries have widened sharply. Hence the negative return of 15 per
cent or so for the year to date, although there has been a modest recovery
during the summer.
Even in equities the picture has been variable, as is only to be expected in
a risky area. For instance, the Turkish market has been very weak and China
is going through a difficult time. But there have been profits to be made in
parts of Latin America - notably Brazil, at least until the resignation of
the finance minister earlier this month - and in India and Korea.
In any case, definitions of emerging markets vary. Hong Kong is now an
advanced economy but in some respects it serves as a proxy for China. Mexico
is becoming progressively integrated into the north American economy. The
real pioneers are looking further afield, to countries such as Morocco,
Bangladesh and Vietnam.
A search for higher returns lies behind the surge in investor interest in
developing countries. The attitude of US investors has been pivotal. In the
past they have been largely stay-at-homes but by 1993 Wall Street appeared
to have reached rather high (and therefore unattractive levels) given the
modest long-term economic growth prospects of the US economy.
Coincidentally, political shifts altered the attitudes of many developing
countries, including the former Soviet block. Privatisation programmes were
introduced, often involving the sale of important state corporations
including telephone and oil companies. Cross-border investment restrictions
were relaxed.
Bodies such as the Washington-based IFC, an equity-oriented affiliate of the
World Bank, began to get much more involved in development programmes. New
stock exch-anges were set up in many countries, including Russia.
In 1993, according to the IFC, some 2,000 enterprises in the 25 emerging
markets it regularly tracks raised some Dollars 38bn in new equity issues.
These emerging markets have grown to represent 12 per cent of world equity
market capitalisation on IFC definitions.
In fact, the emerging markets, taken as a group, now add up in
capitalisation terms to the world's third-biggest market, after the US and
Japan. Often, indeed, investors regard them as forming a distinct asset
class, offering high but risky returns.
The high returns are based upon rapid economic growth. Whereas the G7
advanced countries have slowed down to average longer-term growth rates of
perhaps between 2 and 3 per cent the developing countries are capable of 6
per cent or more. For several years China, for example, has grown at 13 or
14 per cent, and it still has vast potential, although it is now slowing
down after signs of overheating (including a rise in the inflation rate to
about 25 per cent).
US investors have suddenly latched on to the potential of the emerging
markets. Last year around Dollars 20bn flowed into US mutual funds
specialising in emerging markets, and further large sums were channelled
through more general global funds. US pension funds are also planning to
raise their exposures to emerging markets substantially (from only about 0.5
per cent of their portfolios at present).
Michael Howell, global strategist at Baring Securities, says in the five
years since the dismantling of the Berlin Wall, which symbolised the
political changes, flows of capital to emerging markets have jumped by 15
times.
He reckons that emerging stock markets will account for some 40 per cent of
the global market capitalisation by 2010. Already the markets are becoming
broad enough for some investors to concentrate on particular sectors such as
communications, infrastructure and the media. 'There's more interest outside
the country angle and focused on industries,' he says.
This flow of capital into less developed countries is now on a large enough
scale to have important implications for the future shape of the global
economy. Indeed, the scare over capital shortages earlier this year owed
something to the fear that the draining of financial resources out of the US
and Europe was forcing up the real cost of capital.
If there is to continue to be a large-scale shift of investment capital to
the emerging markets then western governments must accept at least two
consequences. They must reduce their own borrowing levels, or rates of
return will indeed be forced up. And the advanced economies must run current
account surpluses to offset their deficits on capital account.
Plainly, countries such as Germany and Japan, which are benefiting heavily
from the capital investment boom in developing countries, will find it
easier to fit into this framework than the US and the UK. The latter states
have become big importers of consumer goods - but it is impossible for very
long to combine high consumption with heavy investment.
The main short-term risk for the emerging markets is therefore that US
interest rates will rise substantially further to rebalance the US economy,
and in the process the flow of investment dollars will be choked off.
For the time being, however, buoyant exports and rising commodity prices are
boosting activity in many third world economies. These are strongly positive
trends, and serve to explain why share prices in many of the emerging
markets have rallied strongly since the wave of profit-taking in the spring.

(6): Disinterested protectors of the public good - Central banks /
Independence is the fashionable nostrum of the day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The reputation of central bankers as a professional caste has seen a
renaissance over the past 15 years. Once regarded as hard-faced proponents
of financial orthodoxy - a not wholly undeserved reputation in the light of
their performance in the 1930s - they are now increasingly seen as
disinterested protectors of the public good. Such is the trust in these new
Platonic guardians that elected politicians have been prepared to delegate
to them the conduct of monetary policy, sometimes within a framework of
minimal accountability. Central banking independence, in whatever form, is
the fashionable economic nostrum of the day.
This remarkable turnround owes as much to the dismal experience of monetary
policy under the management of politicians as it does to the central
bankers' own recent record. The great disinflationary successes of the 1980s
and 1990s were, after all, achieved at considerable cost. Paul Volcker's
experiment with money supply targetry at the US Federal Reserve caused havoc
in the economies of primary producers, while draining the developed world of
liquidity. The first world survived and prospered, largely thanks to the
Reagan administration's global exercise in fiscal expansionism; but it took
a huge and protracted joint effort with the International Monetary Fund to
put Latin America back together again.
Meanwhile, the Bundesbank's heroic efforts to preserve monetary stability in
the face of the fiscal strains arising from reunification look as though
they may shortly be successful. Yet the victory will have been won at the
cost of a painful shock to the rest of Europe, where countries that linked
their fortunes and currencies to the D-Mark experienced a severe loss of
output.
Yet, the real villains of the piece in the first three decades of the
post-war period were arguably not the politicians but the economists. It was
they who claimed that there was a trade-off between inflation and
employment, and that it was possible to attain full employment by expanding
demand. As people's expectations began to adjust to the inflationary
consequences, the longer term trade-off between inflation and employment
disappeared. Politicians still had an incentive to reflate for electoral
advantage since this continued to have a short-term, if waning, impact on
output. But the long run impact on anything other than inflation was
negligible.
As well as destroying the political legacy of Keynes, this perception, which
became the conventional wisdom after the oil shock of the mid-1970s, changed
the objectives of monetary policy. If the expansionary escape route from
unemployment no longer existed, economists were forced to conclude that the
most that demand management could achieve was to stabilise the price level.
The attempt to lower the natural rate of unemployment was left to fiscal
policy and to supply side measures which sought to change the structure of
markets.
At much the same time central bankers were struggling to come to terms with
the technicalities of monetary control in the post-Bretton Woods world of
fluctuating exchange rates. They sought a mechanistic alternative to the
discretionary manipulation of short term interest rates; an alternative,
moreover, which would help ward off the political pressures which ensured
that interest were invariably raised too little, too late. There followed a
series of experiments in money supply targetry which foundered in the 1980s
on the rock of an increasingly unpredictable velocity of circulation.
Today, the central bankers have been forced back on to discretionary changes
in interest rates in their tireless pursuit of price stability. Yet the
discretion is tempered by changes in the structure of the relationship
between central banks and governments, which include numerous moves towards
independence. Technical problems remain because of the long time lags
involved in monetary policy. Interest rate changes are being made in
response to forecasts of inflation in 18 months to two years' time. The
question is whether this approach will prove any more effective than what
went before.
Academic research suggests that independent central banks do preside over
lower rates of inflation, though there is little difference in growth and
employment when compared with less independent systems. Equally important,
central banks tend to be granted independence in those countries where there
is a powerful constituency for stable prices. Does such a constituency exist
across the whole of the developed world?
Tightening policy in the midst of an expansion hurts debtors. It also hurts
those who invest in expectation of future growth and inflation, as well as
primary producers and the economically weak. The beneficiaries are
creditors, those manufacturers who need longer-term stability in order to
plan and the economically strong. That suggests a political divide between
the small business people, the farmers and the poor on one side, and the
rich, the elderly and big business on the other.
Yet the evidence does not point to a predictable left-right alignment on
independent central banking. In New Zealand it was introduced under a Labour
government. The new South African government, which carries residual baggage
from the failed communist experiment, has opted for an independent central
bank. Even in the UK there are advocates of independence in the Labour
ranks. The reason is that left-leaning governments stand to gain most from
such a move because they have the greater problem of credibility with
markets.
That said, demography points to a strengthening of the independence movement
in Europe where populations are ageing, because approaching retirement makes
people more anxious to preserve the value of financial assets. The European
Monetary Institute may in due course satisfy that aspiration.
The risk in all this is that expectations will be pitched too high, or that
there will be a re-run of the 1930s. Where independent central bankers have
no mandate or instinctive inclination to address problems of deflation they
may be slow to respond to a sustained contraction in demand. US Fed chairman
Alan Greenspan has admittedly emerged superbly from just such a challenge.
Whether his successor, or his opposite number in some future European
monetary union, will prove half as good on either inflation or deflation is
another matter.

(7): Curing deficit hangovers - Fiscal problems / Stephanie Flanders on debt
crisis fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS

<TEXT>
It has been a long time since the risk of a rich nation defaulting on its
debt seemed worth considering. Yet in some countries, the financial markets
seem to be taking it very seriously indeed. By and large, investors are not
simply punishing governments for the high level of their debt, but showing
doubts about their political will to reduce it.
Most of the world's industrialised nations emerged from the recession with
hefty bills to pay. On average, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development calculates that member governments' budget balances
deteriorated by 3 per cent of GDP over the period. For some countries, as
much as half of the budget deficit was 'structural', which meant that it
could only be cured by taking additional measures to raise revenues and/or
cut spending.
By the start of this year, many had put such measures in place. As the graph
shows, the effect of both fiscal tightening and continued economic growth
should start to stabilise the level of gross government debt in the OECD
area by 2001 at around 70-75 per cent of combined GDP. But that compares
with an average of around 40 per cent at the end of the 1970s. A larger
proportion of public spending, currently around 7 per cent, on average, must
now be used to pay debt interest, compared to 3 1/2 per cent in 1979.
When debt levels are high, there is little scope for governments to make
mistakes about future economic growth, or the path of government spending.
For a country with a debt ratio of 100 per cent, for example, every 1 per
cent increase in the gap between the nominal interest rate on the debt and
the rate of nominal GDP growth adds a further 1 per cent of GDP to the
interest burden.
Indeed, if the interest rate on the debt also exceeds GDP growth in real
terms, a country must run a primary budget surplus - a surplus of revenues
over spending, excluding interest payments - just to keep the debt/GDP ratio
constant. That puts tremendous pressure on elected governments. Raising
taxes to pay off debt is even less popular than raising money for higher
public spending.
Though several face this task, the financial markets seem to have decided
that Sweden, Italy and Canada are the most likely to fail. In at least two
of these, this is because there is an especially large gap between what
politicians need to do and what they seem able to do.
Sweden clearly faces the toughest battle. Having suffered the deepest
recession since the 1930s, the country had a budget deficit of close to 14
per cent of GDP in 1993, compared to a surplus of 5.4 per cent of GDP in
1989. The debt/GDP ratio, only 44 per cent of GDP at the start of the
decade, is now 93 per cent, and rising.
Since Swedish tax revenues already consume some 57 per cent of GDP, the bulk
of debt reduction must be achieved through lower spending. The last
government took some steps towards this, but their defeat in the recent
election showed that the public was in no mood for further austerity. With
unemployment at around 15 per cent of the labour force, the new
administration is unlikely to find it much easier to make the sweeping
reforms required.
There are similar worries about Italy, although the situation there is less
dramatic. The country has a long history of running up debt. But measures
passed last year have already gone some way towards stabilising the gross
debt/GDP ratio, currently over 125 per cent. Indeed, Italy was the only
country in the OECD (except Japan) to boast a primary budget surplus last
year.
Yet the heavy burden of interest payments - which consume over a fifth of
public spending - and recent over-spending mean that the country's debt
ratio will continue to rise, unless the Berlusconi government makes deeper
cuts. The fragility of his coalition has so far put this in doubt.
Political uncertainty also clouds the picture for Canada, possibly the least
worrisome of the three. The country's budget deficit will be around 5 1/2
per cent of GDP in 1994, while the the debt/GDP ratio is now 95 per cent.
However, much of the Canadian deficit was caused by the recession. As long
as the country continues to recover, William Dudley, economist at Goldman
Sachs investment bank, thinks that Canadian debt should stabilise without
further fiscal tightening. In the wake of the recent Quebec elections, the
worry about Canada does not seem to be that the debt itself will reach
unsustainable levels, but, rather, that the possible separation of the
country will cast doubt over who is responsible for it.
As the chart shows, investors' doubts have pushed up long-term interest
rates in all three countries. Their currencies have also suffered,
depreciating about 5 per cent against the D-Mark in the case of the Italian
lira and Swedish krona, and by a similar amount against the US unit in the
Canadian dollar's case.
As far as these countries' governments are concerned, the bitter irony about
the markets' concern for their financial well-being is that it makes their
situation dramatically worse. Rising long-term rates make for even higher
debt interest payments. Countries could, in theory, keep short-term interest
rates low, and reschedule the debt towards short-term bonds. But pressure on
the currency tends to mean official interest rates have to rise, not fall,
to defend its value, possibly further weakening the economy in the process.
Of course, signs of a debt-interest spiral of this kind only make investors
worry more, since the government must take even stricter measures to avert a
crisis. But the mere threat of one is supposed to be enough to force
governments to act sooner rather than later.
In most cases, the chances are that they will. In a world of highly
integrated capital markets, a good international credit rating is simply too
important for a country to throw away with a default on its debt.
In that regard, today's problem countries might well look wistfully to the
past. Many emerged from the second world war with even greater debt burdens:
US national debt was 125 per cent of GDP, in the UK the debt ratio was
closer to 200 per cent. Due, however, to the disintegration of the
international capital market between the wars, the bulk of that debt was
held by a country's own citizens. And tight capital controls prevented them
from taking their money out.
Neither condition holds today. As Sweden and others are painfully learning,
this ensures that their 'local difficulties', even relatively small ones, do
not remain that way for long.

(5): Wall Street's knight to quit - Profile / Sir Dennis Weatherstone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Back in 1988, an internal memorandum at J P Morgan outlined the ambition:
within five years, the prestigious but somewhat staid US commercial bank
would earn Dollars 200m-Dollars 300m a year before tax from the securities
business.
It proved a massive under-assessment. Due in large part to the most benign
bond markets in memory, earnings in 1993 from the securities markets soared.
Revenues from trading topped Dollars 2bn (more than twice the level of the
year before.)
It was a powerful endorsement for the strategy pursued by Sir Dennis
Weatherstone, the bank's chairman and chief executive since the beginning of
1990. A Briton by birth, Sir Dennis (he was knighted in 1990) had risen
through the ranks at J P Morgan over 47 years (48 by the time he retires at
the end of this year.)
Taking over from long-time chairman Lewis Preston, Sir Dennis inherited a
plan first outlined at the bank in the late 1970s.
A secular decline in the lending business and the growth of capital markets
threatened Morgan's long-standing and influential relationships with some of
the US's most powerful corporations. The answer, the bank decided, was to
extend its reach into the underwriting and trading of securities, becoming a
US version of the universal banks which bestride the commercial and
investment banking businesses in continental Europe (though at the time, US
regulation required a strict separation between the two.)
Under Sir Dennis, Morgan has made greater headway in implementing that plan
than anyone expected. Given powers to underwrite and trade corporate bonds
in the US in 1989 and, a year later, to enter the equity market, Morgan has
made rapid strides in the capital markets business - last year, it ranked
seventh in the US league table of debt and equity underwriters. Also, aided
by the triple-A credit rating that makes it an attractive counterparty in
the swaps markets, the bank has become one of the big Wall Street trading
houses.
Earlier this month, Sir Dennis announced his intention to retire at the end
of the year, shortly after reaching the age of 64. He collected Dollars 6.6m
in compensation in 1993 for his efforts and the plaudits of US banking
analysts.
Yet for all that, the British-born chairman leaves the bank with nagging
questions hanging over it. Wall Street remains sceptical about Morgan's
earnings prospects: having reached a high of close to Dollars 80 a year ago,
the bank's share price has slipped to a little over Dollars 60 now. At a
multiple of around nine times estimated 1994 earnings, the market is
indicating it has yet to be convinced of the consistency of the new Morgan's
performance.
It is the bank's greater involvement in the trading business, which fuelled
1993 earnings, that lies behind the concern. With the turn in US interest
rates and the end of the bull market in bonds around the world early this
year, Morgan's trading revenues have sagged. Compared with average quarterly
earnings from trading of more than Dollars 500m in 1993, the first two
quarters of this year produced an average of Dollars 292m. Are the new
Morgan's earnings as volatile as any other investment bank, soaring and
plunging with the markets?
Sir Dennis has been close to the financial markets for much of his life.
Starting out at the age of 16 as a clerk in the foreign exchange department
of the London office of Guaranty Trust (which later merged with J P Morgan,)
he rose to become head of foreign exchange. With his north London, working
class background he was made an unlikely chairman of the US's most
prestigious corporate bank.
Sir Dennis refuses to be drawn into a discussion about how the stockmarket
values Morgan. 'No chairman is ever happy with his share price,' he muses.
However, he defends Morgan against charges that its profits are now prey to
the vagaries of the financial markets.
For a start, the bank's trading revenues suffered less than many of its
investment banking rivals during the turbulent first half of the year.
'Trading in difficult markets, we've done very, very well,' he says.
Also, he argues, Morgan has a strong core of earnings from trading with
corporate and institutional customers, and does not rely on profits from
dealing for its own account. It is a familiar argument, but one which the
market continues to treat with some caution.
While the volatility of earnings remains the biggest concern, there are two
other big questions which Sir Dennis's successor, Douglas Warner, will have
to face.
First, for all its successes, Morgan has yet to break into the so-called
'Bulge Bracket' of banks which dominate the underwriting business in the US
 -Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Salomon, Morgan Stanley and
CS First Boston. Although the leading underwriter outside this pack, its
market share last year was less than half that of its next biggest rival, CS
First Boston. And while it made a quick mark in the bond business, climbing
rapidly up the underwriting league tables, the equity market is proving more
difficult.
Sir Dennis cautions against paying too much attention to league tables.
Morgan's plan has involved building on its existing corporate relationships,
he says. The trick is to keep expanding the range of services it performs
for those customers, rather than to rush out to buy market share.
Second, Morgan will have to tread the fine line between exerting a more
aggressive stance on behalf of its customers, while protecting its own
high-quality reputation. It is a balance that the bank has struck well so
far - though paradoxically, that very success throws into sharp relief any
errors of judgment.
That became clear earlier this year, with the upheaval at Banesto, a Spanish
bank in which a Morgan-organised investment partnership had invested Dollars
160m.
'With the benefit of hindsight, it doesn't look too good,' says Sir Dennis.
'I don't think it was our glorious moment . . . But we're not going to go
through our business and not make any mistakes, anywhere.'

(3): Healthy again but more cautious - Banks / In Europe, many are moving
into an acquisitive phase

The world's banks are in very good health. If that seems an odd view in a
year when Japanese banks are still struggling to recover from the 1980s,
when bank shares fell sharply after US monetary policy tightened, and two
large European banks went through severe financial crises, consider this:
In the US, which sets a pattern for banks in industrialised countries, high
interest margins and profits from securities trading have rescued banks
spectacularly from the trough of 1989-90. Retained earnings have let them
build up capital to the point where many bought back shares this year.
In the UK, the European economy which has recovered fastest from recession,
banks' provisions against bad debts halved in the first six months of the
year. Banks' return on equity rose to about 20 per cent, provoking protests
from consumers and staff unions that they were making excessive profits.
In Hong Kong, the financial centre which has benefited strongly from the
boom in trade and capital flows among the emerging Asia-Pacific economies,
banks have reaped huge gains. HSBC Holdings gained 63 per cent of its
profits from the UK colony although only 29 per cent of its assets are
there.
The banks' state of health in most large economies is such that many have
started to worry about being over-capitalised. In contrast to the crisis in
the US at the turn of the decade when banks such as Citicorp were highly
leveraged, financial ratios have started to look excessively prudent.
It has also led to a renewed spate of consolidation in the US, where banks
have competed to buy each other. Banks are being bought at more than twice
their book value, compared with share trading levels of between 30 and 40
per cent of book value for the worst affected banks four years ago.
Worry over capital is less intense in Europe, where capital ratios are
lower. But moves such as Lloyds Bank's Pounds 1.8bn bid for Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester Building Society, and Swiss Bank Corporation's Dollars 750m
purchase of the US asset manager Brinson Partners, show banks moving into an
acquisitive phase.
The recovery of world banks stems from three factors:
Steady falls in short-term interest rates in the US until February
established a sharply sloped yield curve which let banks make large and
stable securities trading profits. This pattern was followed in Europe until
the rise in bond prices which took most banks by surprise in February.
The large bad debt provisions made at the turn of the decade and in the
early 1980s first against problem country debt, and then against lending in
OECD countries have dropped sharply. The release of problem country
provisions following debt re-scheduling has contributed to banks' profits.
The shock of low profits - and some losses - led to banks re-pricing assets
and imposing higher fees and commissions. This has raised operating income
and return on assets to well in excess of the late 1980s. Net interest
margins for US regional banks stood at 4.8 per cent during 1993.
Such factors have helped banks in industrialised countries which were badly
affected by real estate problems to recover faster than expected. In
Scandinavian countries, where banks were given public support in 1991, banks
are preparing for privatisation after half-year results showing a strong
recovery.
World banking has not been without its crises in 1994. In Spain, there was
the near-collapse of Banco Espanol de Credito after over-rapid expansion. In
France, Credit Lyonnais also faced a large crisis leading to the imposition
of a new management after years of aggressive growth.
In addition, the universal banking system of continental Europe has come
under increased scrutiny. The Schneider affair has damaged the reputation of
Deutsche Bank, the monolith of German banking. It has also raised questions
about whether banks are fit holders of equity stakes in companies.
The process of bank privatisation in Europe, combined with the growing
influence of institutional investors, is likely to lead to a divestment of
industrial holdings. The shake-up of Banco Portugues do Atlantico as a
result of a hostile bid by Banco Comercial Portugal is one example.
The biggest crisis has been in Venezuela, which defied the trend for Latin
American banks to attract increasing interest from overseas investors. The
government has provided more than Dollars 7bn of aid to some of the best
known banks following the failure in January of Banco Latino and runs on
other banks.
Venezuela is the exception in a generally sunny picture for the world's
banks. But there are already signs that the rest of the decade may not prove
as clement as the first half for banks. Although operating profits are
strong, they are under pressure in a variety of ways in OECD countries.
One problem is that the traditional growth in loan demand seen in economic
recovery has been late in coming, and weak where it has emerged. Growth has
resumed in the US, but banks remain cautious about taking on assets related
to property, and balance sheets are not expanding fast.
A second difficulty is that windfall profits last year from trading ended
abruptly following a rise in US interest rates. This led to sharp falls in
operating profits at banks with big trading books. Operating profits before
provisions fell by 45 per cent in the first half at Swiss Bank Corporation.
Finally, banks face an uncertain regulatory climate. The Basle committee of
international banking supervisors is now working on new rules for capital to
be applied to securities and currency trading. This could lead to higher
charges, even if banks are allowed to use their internal risk models.
The IMF/World Bank meeting is an opportunity for banks to remind themselves
how much better times are than in the days of the problem country debt
crisis and the OECD recession of the late 1980s. For now, they have a lot of
capital at their disposal; it remains to be seen how long it will last.

(4): Clouds gather as tide begins to turn - Investment banks / In the US,
they have been forced to tighten their belts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The impact of the steady rise in US interest rates engineered by the Federal
Reserve this year has been felt around the world in stock, bond and currency
markets. The value of financial assets has not only suffered, but clouds
have been cast over the outlook for industrialised economies.
Yet, nowhere has the impact of the Fed's actions been more keenly felt than
on Wall Street. After three years of unprecedented prosperity, the fortunes
of US investment banks have deteriorated in the past two quarters, and many
firms - both big and small - have begun to lay off staff in an attempt to
rein in costs.
The downturn in earnings among the leading investment banks this year has
been dramatic. Every one of the big Wall Street firms posted lower earnings
in the second quarter. Morgan Stanley's profits fell 46 per cent, Bear
Stearns' profits tumbled 74 per cent, Lehman Brothers' revenues slid 22 per
cent, J P Morgan's trading revenues were more than halved, and Salomon
Brothers incurred a loss of Dollars 410m.
Even Merrill Lynch, which as an 'integrated' securities firm is partially
protected from a declining investment banking business by its hefty presence
in broking and asset management, saw its profits fall 37 per cent.
Although the declines are not as disturbing as they may seem at first glance
 -earnings were falling from the record highs that were achieved during 1993
 -there is little doubt that the investment banking cycle has turned a
corner. From 1990 to the end of 1993, US interest rates tumbled to their
lowest levels for more than 30 years, sparking a boom in securities trading
and underwriting the like of which had never been seen before on Wall
Street.
However, since the Fed decided to slow down the pace of economic growth and
stave off inflation by sanctioning an interest rate rise in early February,
the tide has turned. By mid-August, there had been five monetary policy
tightenings which pushed short-term interest rates up from 3 per cent to
4.75 per cent and long-term interest rates up from just over 6 per cent to
7.5 per cent.
Investment banks have been hard hit by the rise in interest rates because
rising rates have had a negative impact upon their business in three
distinctly different ways.
First, higher rates have depressed bond and stock prices in the US and
overseas. Lower securities prices have shown up on investment banks' books
in the form of lower trading profits as traders' short-term strategies -
many of them based on an outlook of low and stable interest rates -
unravelled. Some banks' problems have been exacerbated by their use of
derivative instruments, which can exaggerate the negative impact on
securities prices of rising interest rates.
Equally as damaging, banks started to run up huge paper losses on their
securities inventories, because they were buying stocks and bonds from
distressed customers that they could not sell on again. It was a sharp drop
in the value of its inventories that was the chief factor behind Salomon's
huge loss in the second quarter. Also, the rise in rates has contributed to
unsettled global foreign exchange markets, which has left big investment
banks nursing large currency trading losses.
Second, higher rates have led to a slowdown in securities underwriting,
traditionally one of the most profitable businesses for investment banks.
When rates are low, companies rush to borrow money on the capital markets,
mostly by issuing debt. Banks reap the rewards as underwriters and traders
of that debt. But since interest rates began to rise in February, demand for
banks' debt underwriting services from corporations has steadily fallen. At
first, underwriting volumes held up quite well, but as it became clear that
rates were going higher, volumes plunged. In the second quarter this year,
companies issued debt in the US worth Dollars 161bn, down 42 per cent from a
year earlier.
Underwriting activity in the equity market has also eased, mostly because
the fall in share prices has created a climate unfavourable to new stock
issues. Over the first half of the year, the issuance of new shares by
companies in the US fell 21 per cent to Dollars 37.6bn.
Third, higher interest rates have had a direct impact upon investment banks'
finances. The industry's earnings between 1990-1993 were so strong because
the slope of the yield curve - which tracks the relationship between the
yield on a security and its maturity - was unusually steep. This allowed
banks to take out short-term loans at around 2 per cent to 3 per cent, and
invest the proceeds in longer-term securities paying out interest rates of
between 5 per cent and 7 per cent.
Since the Fed began tightening monetary policy, short-term interest rates
have risen faster than long-term interest rates, thus flattening the slope
of the yield curve and reducing the banks' ability to reap large profits on
their interest earnings.
As investment banks' profits have fallen, so management across Wall Street
has been forced to tighten their belts. For the first time since early 1990,
a group of big firms have announced sizeable lay-offs. In August, Merrill
Lynch, the industry leader, cut 90 people from its fixed-income department.
That came a week after PaineWebber, another 'integrated' firm, trimmed its
bond department payroll.
More recently, Smith Barney dismissed 15 investment bankers, including
several managing directors.
The lay-offs, however, are a precautionary, rather than a panic, move. In
spite of the difficulties of 1994, investment bankers are not unduly
pessimistic about the longer-term outlook.
However, the interest rate outlook is unclear. Analysts remain to be
convinced that this year's tightening by the Fed is having the desired
effect of slowing the economy and keeping inflation under control.
Also, amid the gloom about falling bond prices, and declining trading
profits and underwriting revenues, there is one bright spot in investment
banking - the continued revival in the mergers and acquisitions business.
This year, M&amp;A activity has been strong, with a series of huge deals in the
telecommunications, entertainment, health care and defence industries
keeping investment bankers busy.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance (1): Although the

impossible to look to the future with unqualified optimism. Worries, such as
inflation and unemployment, still abound

The good news is that the global economy is growing well. But except in the
newly industrialising countries of east Asia, few people seem to feel it.
Although world output this year is likely to grow faster than at any time
since 1989, the recovery from the slow growth and recession of the early
1990s is fraught with uncertainty.
Fast and far-reaching changes are everywhere - in international relations,
domestic politics, economics and business - unsettling policymakers,
entrepreneurs and employees in developed and developing countries alike.
A year ago, few commentators in the industrialised world would have bet on
there now being a robust upturn in the United States, a well-established
recovery in the UK, a strong bounce back from recession in Germany and the
first signs of Japan pulling out of its worst economic downturn since the
second world war.
Outside the industrialised world - defined as the 25 member countries of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development - the overall picture
is even better.
A number of developing nations have emerged as the engines of global growth
in this decade. The International Monetary Fund has forecast that the
developing economies as a group should grow at about twice the rate of the
industrialised countries this year and next.
New economic powers are emerging that should give the world economy an added
boost as it heads into the next millenium. Latin America, although not
without problems, has largely pulled free of the debt crisis that made the
1980s that region's 'lost decade'. China may be struggling to control
inflation and runaway growth. But it is likely future historians will
declare that country's emergence as one of the world's economic power houses
to be the economic event of this decade.
Economically, the world still stands to reap some benefits from the end of
the cold war. One consequence - peace and a democratically-elected
government in South Africa - could, with luck and good judgment, open up new
vistas of prosperity for that country and the continent as a whole. Events
over the past 12 months have made it possible to think of peace and economic
co-operation among the countries of the Middle East for the first time since
the second world war.
But it is impossible to look to the future with unqualified optimism. The
collapse of communism has brought problems as well as promise. Worries
abound. The present global upswing is proving anything but comfortable.
Inflation is a case in point. It appears broadly under control, in spite of
a surge in commodity prices. Subdued inflation holds out the hope that
growth can be sustained. Yet financial markets are sceptical and thrown into
turmoil at the slightest hint of rising prices.
While 'tiger' economies such as Singapore, Thailand and Taiwan continue to
attract foreign investment and climb up the league tables of international
competitiveness, other developing countries continue to be plagued by
corruption, famine and civil war.
There is the still unresolved problem of unemployment - a tragedy for some
35m people in the industrial countries and countless millions elsewhere.
For many in work, there is constant and unsettling change at the workplace
as companies restructure and strive to become more efficient.
This turmoil in the world of work reflects two forces over which governments
and individuals have very little control: globalisation and technological
change.
The world is shrinking daily as the costs of computing power and
telecommunications fall. The multimedia revolution, harnessing the computer,
telephone and television, is generating new products and services such as
the Internet, which may be the precursor of the much-trumpeted global
information superhighways. Multimedia could prove to be as significant in
the development of mankind as the harnessing of steam and the development of
the railways in the 19th century or the exploitation and spread of electric
power in the early years of this century.
But new competitors are emerging at a bewildering speed to challenge
established companies and ways of conducting business. In a world where
knowledge is increasingly perceived as the key to prosperity, giant
industrial and commercial corporations can quickly become dinosaurs. The
decline of IBM, once a synonym for the world computer industry, is
symptomatic of the acceleration of change. In today's world, problem
industries are just as likely to be high-tech as they are to be smokestack.
Symbolising and promoting the frenetic development of the global economy are
the financial markets. The liberalisation of capital markets around the
globe and the falling cost of telecommunications have greatly increased
their turnover and volatility and their capacity to sway events.
A few years ago, an article such as this would have focused almost
immediately on the role of governments and economic policymakers as
initiators of change. Today, policymakers are lucky if they can avoid being
overwhelmed by events. Technological and geopolitical changes have turned
many of them into bit players on the world economic stage.
Take the case of Alan Greenspan, the powerful chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board. True, he caught financial markets on the hop with his
decision to nudge short-term US interest rates upwards by a quarter
percentage point in February. But what was supposed to be a prudent,
well-signalled pre-emptive move that would demonstrate that the US monetary
authorities were well in control of the domestic economy had unforeseen
consequences.
It ushered in months of market instability as bond investors and
marketmakers jostled to restructure their holdings with as little loss as
possible. The upshot has been an upwards movement of long-term interest
rates of far greater significance for the world economy than Mr Greenspan's
initial and subsequent monetary tightenings.
Because they process the many billions of dollars worth of investments
flowing across national borders each day, the markets have become the
police, judge and jury of the world economy - a worrying thought given that
they tend to view events and policies through the distorting lenses of fear
and greed.
The collapse of communism - symbolised by the fall of the Berlin Wall five
years ago - was hailed by many as marking the victory of free market
liberalism. For Francis Fukuyama, a US academic, it even signified the end
of history. Today we know better. Instead of ending history, the end of
communism and the cold war merely opened a new chapter, giving rise to new
tensions as well as new opportunities.
This summer's migration of boat people from Cuba to the US in search of a
better life was an example of the forces unleashed by the ending of the old
balance of power.
The trade dispute pursued with such zeal by the Clinton administration
against Japan over Japan's supposedly excessive trade surplus shows how
friends can fall out when the common enemy has disappeared.
The end of the cold war may yet exacerbate rivalries between the established
and newly-industrialing countries by adding a new dimension to the process
of globalisation.
Globalisation has been one of the more significant developments in the
industrialised world over the past 15 years. Driven by the desire of
companies to produce and sell goods and services in more markets, it has led
to the spread of corporate operations across borders through international
investment, trade and collaboration for purposes such as product
development, production, sourcing and marketing.
According to the OECD, globalisation has entailed 'a turbulent process of
birth and death of firms, the rise and fall of whole sectors of activity and
the re-allocation of production within, as well as between, regions and
countries'. As many as one in 10 jobs a year have been destroyed by this
process. But it has also created employment on a similar scale.
It is because globalisation has so far taken place mainly within the group
of industrialised countries that the destruction and creation of jobs on
this scale has been socially and politically acceptable. According to this
year's World Investment Report from the United Nations Conference on Trade
and Development (Unctad), multinational companies employ nearly 10 per cent
of paid non-farm jobs worldwide. But nearly a fifth of non-farm jobs in the
industrialised countries are provided by multinationals.
This may not be the case in the future. The fax machine, for example,
already allows professionals in India to do routine architectural or audit
work for clients in Britain at a fraction of the cost of UK-based companies.
Prof Fritz Scharpf of Germany's Max Planck Institute has pointed out that
the end of the Soviet Empire and the disappearance of the rival ideology to
capitalism has made it safer for companies to invest in low-cost countries
without fear of expropriation.
Only a small number of developing states have so far emerged to challenge
the industrialised economies. According to International Economy, a US
magazine, Clinton administration officials have identified a 'big 10'
particularly promising developing countries that are growing about twice as
fast as the rest of the world. In about five years, South Korea, greater
China (including Hong Kong and Taiwan), Indonesia, India, South Africa,
Turkey, Poland, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina will together account for about
the same share of world imports as either Japan or the European Union, they
believe.
If true, that should be good news for the industrial countries. It should
mean more opportunities for their exporters.
But, relative to the rest of the world, such changes would reinforce the
slow but steady diminution of the industrialised countries' economic
strength that has underpinned their status and influence: and this despite
their undisputed domination of certain key areas of production such as
computers, aircraft and - still - automobiles.
IMF figures show that growth in the developing countries (excluding former
communist states making the difficult transition to market-based economies)
has only once fallen below 4 per cent in the past eight years. Growth in the
industrial world has only once risen above 4 per cent in the same period.
In June, the OECD upgraded its growth forecasts for its member countries to
2.6 per cent this year and 2.9 per cent in 1995. Although such growth would
be a marked improvement on performance in the early 1990s, it will be
insufficient on its own to deal with the OECD countries' economic problems
and especially with unemployment.
At the OECD's annual ministerial meeting in June and at July's Group of
Seven summit in Naples, the industrialised countries resolved to embrace
innovation and adapt. They agreed to reject protection, encourage
enterprise, pursue deregulation and make their labour markets more flexible.
As evidence of their determination to tackle unemployment, the OECD
countries this summer adopted a report with about 60 specific
recommendations to expand job opportunities. These will be used by OECD
member states to fashion tailor-made policy programmes with the help of the
Paris-based organisation.
But the last decade of the 20th century is proving a difficult time for
democratically-elected governments in the developed world. No class or group
of workers is escaping the effects of structural change. The swollen budget
deficits that are the legacy of recession and too many years of rewarding
political support with social largesse remain to be tackled. In managing
change, ministers and officials have to take unpopular decisions.
For that reason, governments often agree to change and then have
difficulties implementing it. One example is the Uruguay Round of trade
liberalising measures which, after having been signed with great fanfare in
Marrakesh, Morocco, in April, still awaits full ratification.
For years the developed countries have promised to cut farm subsidies,
recognising correctly that they hurt their own taxpayers and consumers and
rob poorer developing nations of a comparative advantage. Yet in its latest
annual review of farm policies and trade, the OECD estimated that combined
transfers to agriculture from consumers and tax payers in its member
countries fell by less than 1 per cent to just over USDollars 335bn last
year compared with 1992.
However, it would be wrong to paint too gloomy a picture of the
industrialised world's prospects. The sharp drop of 376,000 in Britain's
unemployment since December 1992 could be a sign that labour market reforms,
along the lines advocated by the OECD, can be effective. The fall in UK
joblessness has been unusually early in the cycle.
Germany's stronger than expected upturn this year has confounded those
critics who argued that its industries were inflexible and its working
practices sclerotic. For the past 30 years, the US has shown itself to be an
engine of job creation with the result that unemployment stands at about 6
per cent compared with around 11 per cent in the European Union. But the US
surge in employment has not been matched by growth in wages. Between 1978
and 1993 average US real wages stagnated.
As the US labour market shows, the economy of the industrialised world is a
complex mix of good and bad. The same is true of the developing world where
conditions vary greatly from country to country.
There are the successes of the rapidly growing east Asian and Latin American
economies which have embraced market-based economic policies - often more
enthusiastically than the big industrialised economies. On the other hand,
resource-rich Russia and the Ukraine are still struggling with the cultural,
political and administrative problems of moving from command economy systems
to market-based economies.
The tribal slaughter in Rwanda, the boat people trying to leave Cuba and
Haiti and the conflicts that have brought untold misery in former Soviet
republics such as Georgia and Tajikistan are just examples from the many
parts of the world which lack the most basic conditions for creating
economic well being.
Such regional crises are a reminder of how far we are from a 'new world
order'. There are also plenty of global problems that governments have been
slow to address. This month's UN conference on population and development in
Cairo was the first to tackle the subject for a decade. Economic
policymakers have yet to consider an international approach to migration
although economic factors are usually the cause of people moving from their
homes.
Often, it seems, the first response of the industrialised countries to the
complexities of the global economy has been regional.
It was easier for the US administration to negotiate and win Congressional
approval for the North American Free Trade Area with Mexico and Canada than
it has been to negotiate and obtain backing for the Uruguay Round.
Hopes of regional integration continue to cast their spell in the European
Union. The 12 months of calm in the European exchange rate mechanism,
following its crises of 1992 and 1993 have revived the prospects for
Economic and Monetary Union.
Nonetheless, in this, the 50th anniversary year of the Bretton Woods
agreements setting up the IMF and World Bank, policymakers have realised
that they cannot ignore the interdepence of their countries or the
international institutions that helped shape the world economy since the
second world war.
The leaders of the G7 countries have agreed that next year's economic summit
in Halifax, Nova Scotia, should review the institutions of global
co-operation as a first step towards making global economic management fit
better with the realities of the post-cold war world. This, said President
Clinton, was 'a commitment to discuss in Halifax what we want the world to
look like 20 years from now'.
This is a potentially bold move. It may lead to nothing given the strength
of national interests. But in view of the doubts surrounding the present
economic recovery, world leaders would stand charged with gross neglect if
they did not strive to improve the outlook for growth by strengthening
economic co-operation.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance (2): World population
growth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The next 30 years will see another 3.5bn people added to the world's
population, according to projections by the United Nations Population Fund.
What is more, those startling estimates assume that fertility rates - the
average number of children borne by a woman - continue to fall in most
developing countries.
Even though family sizes have been falling as economic and social
development occurs, and as contraception becomes widely available,
developing countries have also seen life expectancy soar in the past 40
years from 41 to 61 years.
As a result, industrialised countries can expect their share of the world's
population to shrink given their slow rates of population growth: at present
about 1 per cent a year in North America, 0.5 per cent a year in the former
Soviet Union and 0.3 per cent a year in western Europe. Meanwhile, their
populations are ageing: the UN expects the proportion of people aged 65 and
over in industrialised countries to rise from the present 12.7 per cent to
18.4 per cent by 2025.
The UN warns that population growth will put huge strains on the supply of
natural resources such as forests, fish and clean air. Industralised
countries should also brace themselves for increased migratory pressures.
But it dismisses fears of a global food shortage, pointing out that over the
past 10 years, the world's food production has increased by 24 per cent,
faster than population growth.

FT  30 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Losses extended towards the close of
dealing - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What had begun as a gloomy session in the UK stock market turned distinctly
more sinister yesterday afternoon when markets across Europe reacted
strongly to US data suggesting accelerated economic recovery. A Pounds 250m
sell programme from a leading US investment bank fell on a market where
trading books have been mostly squared off ahead of tonight's close to
trading for the third quarter of the year.
Marketmaking firms, which were still tidying up after selling programmes
earlier in the week, hastily cut share quotations yesterday afternoon but
were believed to have suffered heavy losses none the less.
The FT-SE 100 Index was around 24 points down in mid-afternoon and quickly
plunged through the 3,000 mark as Wall Street reacted to news of a revised
gain of 4.1 per cent in US second-quarter GDP and a 9.7 per cent leap in
August new home sales. The Dow Jones Industrial Average showed a fall of 22
points in UK trading hours and weakness in Federal bonds fuelled worries
over prospects for rate tightening in the US.
At the close, the FT-SE 100-share Index was 46.2 off at 2,992.5, having
steadied after touching 2,991.6. With only one more trading day left, the
Footsie index is showing a small loss over the 1994 third quarter. Brokerage
sources believe that some fund managers are improving the appearance of
portfolios by selling equities this week, even though returns on cash are
not attractive.
The stock market was under pressure from the opening as it faced weakness
from other European bourses and a batch of developments in the domestic
utility sector. British Gas weakened after the much-heralded early morning
meeting with institutional investors in the City of London failed to inspire
support. Confirmation of the UK government's intentions to sell its 40 per
cent stakes in National Power and PowerGen helped the sector, since the
investment funds will hasten to increase weightings; but the prospect of a
further, and substantial, cash drain was not helpful for the equity market
as a whole.
The sudden renewal of the bear rush badly caught out marketmakers who had
bought stock during the upswing of the previous session. Yesterday's sell
programme was believed to have been taken aboard by the US bank on Wednesday
when the Footsie was some 40 points higher than at last night's close.
Weakness across the range of equities was also reflected in a fall of 29.8
in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which closed at 3,504. But overall, trading
volume was not high. The day's Seaq total of 586.5m shares compared with
577.5m in the previous session. Retail business was worth Pounds 1.57bn on
Wednesday, a hopeful return to the higher end of this year's daily averages
and therefore a sign of a healthier market.
Strategists sounded unsure of the significance of the renewed shakeout in
equities. On the one hand, it is clear technical factors surrounding the end
of the quarter were affecting markets yesterday; but on the other, some
analysts expressed concern over the strong data on the US economy.
These statistics revived fears that the Federal Reserve may feel forced to
act on US interest rates, and this tended to counter-balance yesterday's
decision by the Bundesbank to leave key rates unchanged. The UK is regarded
as the European market most likely to be immediately affected if US rates
rise.
Next week brings a full calendar of US economic statistics, including
construction spending and factory orders and - most importantly - the latest
payroll and unemployment figures. Arriving in the wake of yesterday's strong
GDP and housing numbers, these statistics are likely to unsettle equity and
bond markets.

FT  30 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: BA falls sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO, JEFFREY BROWN and GEORGE HORSINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Airways, beset by air fare competition, received a further jolt
yesterday with the news that a major US trade investment was deferring a
quarterly dividend.
The culprit is USAir, 25 per cent owned by BA, which is passing a quarterly
convertible preference payment at a cost to BA of Pounds 16m. BA slid 16 to
344p in 7.7m volume.
The fear among traders is that USAir's dividend announcement is the prelude
to what could, conceivably, prove to be even more dramatic news given the
parlous condition of the North American airlines business.
The suspicion is growing that BA's supposed springboard into the US market
could shortly involve the UK airline in heavy write-offs of its Dollars 400m
investment.
Hotels group Forte was one of a handful of stocks that managed to resist the
market slide, as dealers celebrated a better than expected set of interim
figures.
The shares closed 3 1/2 ahead at 222p after the group reported a profits
rise to Pounds 60m, from Pounds 37m a year earlier. There was heavy trading
in the stock and volume jumped to 11m. UBS, the company's broker, was said
to have been an aggressive buyer of the shares. Relief at the lack of a
pred-icted rights issue also boosted sentiment.
Several brokers raised full-year profits expectations by a modest amount.
Kleinwort Benson, which increased its full-year estimate by Pounds 6m to
Pounds 135m, called the figures 'encouraging'. Analysts at BZW lifted their
forecast by Pounds 4m to Pounds 126m, but they remain sellers of the stock
because 'the cash flow recovery will not be as strong as earnings recovery,
thus dividend growth is likely to be constrained'.
Redland blew hot and cold, initially racing up to 529p after the better than
expected interim figures but then going into reverse and closing a net 29
off at 493p as analysts emerged from the post-results meeting with news of
higher tax charges, resulting from higher German corporate taxes and
exhaustion of capital allowances.
SG Warburg shares suffered on two counts, with worries about possible losses
in international bond and equity markets affecting sentiment and Merrill
Lynch, the US brokerage, said to have been heavily involved in the stock via
an OTC option. Warburg settled 19 1/2 lower at 681p.

Nuclear submarine contractor VSEL soared 225 to 1,228p after its admission
that it had received a takeover approach. Traders pinpointed British
Aerospace and GEC as the bid frontrunners, and the talk in the market
suggested that a full blown auction could well be in the offing.
If the consensus among analysts is any guide, any possible opening bid could
be an all-share offer of around 1,350p a share. Both potential bidders found
ready sellers, with BAe tumbling 15 to 449p and GEC dipping 4 to 289p.
Vosper Thornycroft, another maritime defence contractor, shared in the
excitement, moving up 23 to 720p.

FT  30 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: ICI upgraded
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICI shares put on a resolute performance in the face of the sharp market
slide, finishing only 7 cheaper at 828 1/2 p. The stock attracted keen
institutional support, triggered by a series of profits upgrades and
recommendations as the company has embarked on a series of meetings with
leading broking houses.
Hoare Govett raised its earnings forecast for the current year from Pounds
450m to Pounds 495m and that for 1995 from Pounds 600m to Pounds 650m, and
moved the shares from 'undervalued' to 'buy' after a strong showing in the
third quarter. 'Current momentum is suggesting a share price move to 900p
over the coming quarter,' said Mr Martin Evans, chemicals analyst at Hoare.
NatWest Securities also hoisted its earnings expectations, by 11 per cent to
Pounds 500m for the current year and by 3 per cent to Pounds 670m for 1995.

FT  30 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Active trade in utilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO, JEFFREY BROWN and GEORGE HORSINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British Gas strategy meeting, details of the Offer review of the
Scottish power companies, and confirmation that the government is to sell
its remaining 40 per cent stakes in the two English generators, triggered
exceptionally heavy trading in the utilities areas of the market.
The water sector provided one of the FT-SE 100's best performers in Severn
Trent, which advanced 9 to 551p after more switching from the regional
electricity companies (recs), while the two Scottish generator groups
plunged, with Scottish Power easily the FT-SE 100's worst performer.
Utilities analysts said the Offer review was broadly as expected but that
the stocks were hit for a number of reasons. These included the market's
overall poor performance, over-optimistic expectations of real dividend
growth which some of the bulls said could be in the region of 8 to 10 per
cent, the underperformance of the English generator companies, and worries
about Scottish Hydro-Electric taking its case to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
Three of the market's heavyweight broking firms, BZW, SG Warburg and
Kleinwort Benson, were said to have adopted a bearish view of the regulatory
review and been partly responsible for driving Scottish Power down 31 to
349p in 15m shares traded and Hydro-Electric 45 lower to 327p on 8.5m.
National Power outperformed the market and lost only 3 1/2 at 450 1/2 p and
PowerGen managed a marginal gain at 514 1/2 p, with dealers expect-ing the
big institutions to chase both stocks ahead of the share sales.
There were no real shocks in British Gas's strategy presentation; the stock
receded 9 1/2 to 290p on turnover of 28m. Some analysts were disturbed by
the apparent inconsistency on dividend policy, but others professed
satisfaction with the company's performance at the meeting and especially
that of Mr Giordano, the non-executive chairman.
Ms Irene Himono at Strauss Turnbull increased her current year dividend
forecast from 14.5p tp 14.75p and that for next year to 15.5p. Mr Steve
Turner at Nomura moved his dividend estimates up to 14.8p and 15.5p and
labelled British Gas a 'trading buy'. He added: 'It was a very positive
presentation, with the management committed to delivering real dividend
growth.'

FT  30 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures fell steeply yesterday, blighted partly by heavy selling
from a number of US houses, and premiums to the cash market narrowed
dramatically.
In relatively heavy trading volume, the FT-SE 100 December contract retraced
all of the previous session's gain, closing a full 60 points down at 2,996.
At this level the premium to the cash market is 3.5 points - in market
contrast to Wednesday's occasional 20 points-plus - with the fair value
premium at around 19.
Most of the morning and early afternoon was characterised by modest
activity. But some US houses, notably Citicorp and Goldman Sachs, weighed in
heavily with selling orders after 3pm.
The December contract bounced back above 3,000 after the official close, but
traders said the level of last-minute support had been tentative at best.
At the 4:10pm official close, trading volume was 14,021 contracts, broadly
in line with the previous day, rising to 16,321 by the end of the day.
Traded option turnover edged lower to 28,981 lots from the 30,859 of the
previous session. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE volume totalled 9,305 contracts.
Ladbroke was the most actively traded stock option at 2,413 lots, followed
by Argyll Group at 2,068 contracts and Forte at 1,563.

FT  30 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Mexico further weakens
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Equities fell a further 1.7 per cent yesterday as nervous investors
continued to take profits on the back of Wednesday's political
assassination.
Traders said the Mexican Stock Exchange suffered another declining session
as no concrete motive for the killing of Mr Francisco Ruiz Massieu,
secretary-general of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party, came to
light. Selling of Mexican blue chip ADRs on Wall Street also drove the
market down. The IPC index closed 47.31 points lower at 2,717.51, but volume
dropped to a moderate 90.3m shares, valued at 1.12bn new pesos.
Brazil
Sao Paulo rallied 3.1 per cent as domestic and foreign investors returned to
the market on bullish sentiment ahead of Brazil's presidential election on
Monday. The Bovespa index finished 1,655 ahead at 54,426.

FT  30 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow runs into losses again as
bonds retreat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks lost ground yesterday as the bond market retreated in the face of
more evidence of an accelerating economy, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 23.55 lower at 3,854.63, while the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 dipped 2.61 to 462.24. But secondary indices were
little changed: the Nasdaq composite eased just 0.66 to 759.35. Volume on
the NYSE remained heavy, with 302m shares traded by the close.
With equity investors braced for another boost in short-term interest rates,
yesterday brought more evidence to support an imminent move by the Federal
Reserve to tighten credit. The Commerce Department reported that sales of
new homes last month had climbed 9.7 per cent to an annual rate of 703,000
units, against a revised July rate of 644,000. It also issued an upward
revision of its estimate of second-quarter growth to 4.1 per cent, from 3.8
per cent.
The stronger than expected readings sent bond prices sliding and briefly
pushed the yield on the benchmark 30-year government issue to its highest
point of the year.
With the prospect of a further rise in rates looming larger, concern over
the outcome of US-Japanese trade negotiations was also growing. The collapse
of the talks could lead the Clinton administration to follow through on a
threat to impose sanctions on Tokyo.
Against this backdrop, blue chips opened weaker and were quickly showing
solid declines. Alcoa, which has outperformed the market in recent sessions,
shed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 85 3/4 , while General Motors receded Dollars
1 to Dollars 46 3/4 . But Goodyear Tire improved Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 33
3/4 on an upgrading by PaineWebber.
Alcatel Alsthom made an appearance at the top of the NYSE's most active list
during the morning. ADRs in the diversified French group fell a further
Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 18 1/2 after Wednesday's initial reaction to
interim results well below expectations.
In the technology sector, IBM was Dollars 1 ahead at Dollars 69 1/2 . Compaq
managed to close Dollars  1/8 up at Dollars 32 3/8: earlier in the session,
SG Warburg had announced that it was lowering its 1994 earnings estimate for
the company, and the stock retreated in heavy trading.
Storage Technology dropped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 28 3/4 after disclosing
that EMC had filed a patent infringement lawsuit against the company.
USAir's common shares lost 25 per cent of their value, plummeting Dollars 1
to Dollars 4. The decline followed the airline's announcement that it would
defer dividends on its series A preferred stock because of heavy operating
losses.
Canada
Worries about the outlook for US inflation after the latest spate of
economic data, combined with uncertainty ahead of today's deadline for a US
trade deal with Japan, unhinged bond markets and produced slightly lower
stock prices on the Toronto market.
The TSE 300 composite index ended 10.43 points off at 4,362.05, with
declines outnumbering rises by 412 to 299 after volume of 57.1m shares.
Overall, 10 of the 14 sub-group indices were down, with consumer products,
transportation and mining stocks posting the biggest falls, and
merchandising and pipelines showing the best advances.

FT  30 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Alcatel leaves trail of damage
across Continent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alcatel-Alsthom's half-year results, coming in well below expectations on
Wednesday evening, left a trail of damage across Europe yesterday, writes
Our Markets Staff.
The French group's shares fell 7.1 per cent in New York overnight, and were
suspended limit down in Paris before falling FFr78.30 or 13.8 per cent to a
new 1994 closing low of FFr489, after FFr472.
This totally undermined confidence in the French stock market, said Mr John
Blackley of James Capel, and in the electronics sector across Europe. In the
afternoon, selling from the US in thin trading conditions broadened to
encompass whole markets, and most of the Continent.
Alcatel's troubles in Germany were reflected in the share price of Siemens,
DM25.50 or 3.9 per cent lower at DM629.50 after a painful afternoon in the
Frankfurt market. In Zurich, Brown Boveri fell SFr41 or 3.5 per cent to
SFr1,124 and, in Stockholm, Asea gave up SKr20 or 3.6 per cent to SKr541
amid worries that they could be hit by similar profit pressures.
FRANKFURT, initially, put in a conventional response to the Alcatel news,
the Dax index falling 24.53 or 1.2 per cent to 2,043.58 on the session, with
Volkswagen and BMW joining Siemens as big underperformers. Turnover picked
up from DM5.3bn to DM6.7bn, reflecting the size of the names involved.
However, the afternoon saw a more extended version of the weakness that hit
Paris for a while on Wednesday, and the Ibis indicated Dax hit 2,010.75
before closing 54.28 or 2.6 per cent lower at 2,016.08.
Traders saw hedge funds offloading stock, and straight investment selling
from the US. BMW finished DM40 or 5.2 per cent down at DM734, and VW at
DM426.50, off DM24.70 or 5.5 per cent.
The afternoon weakness took in a wide range of stocks, including Deutsche
Bank, MAN (in trucks and automotive equipment), Degussa and Henkel (in
specialty chemicals), Kaufhof (in retailing), and engineers and utilities.
PARIS ended 1.5 per cent down, the CAC-40 index losing 28.77 at 1,876.18.
Turnover rose from FFr3.19bn to FFr5.6bn, with Alcatel accounting for
FFr1.9bn of the total.
Reaction to the Alcatel figures was neither as widespread, nor as acute, as
in Frankfurt, but French brokers compensated by worrying about the morning
slide on Wall Street, US interest rates and inflation worries in general.
Once again results, or the anticipation of them, produced movement. Saint
Louis, the sugar and paper group, rose FFr14 to FFr1,400 ahead of a 59 per
cent jump in first-half net attributable profits.
In financials, BNP rose FFr3.10 to FFr239.8 ahead of its own half-year
figures, but Paribas, in a similar situation, lost FFr7.80 at FFr312.2.
ZURICH fell 1.2 per cent as Wall Street weakened and the SMI index finished
32.0 lower at 2,558.0.
Trading in UBS shares was unusually heavy as the market buzzed with rumours.
A key story was that UBS wanted to reduce the influence of BK Vision, the
investment company controlled by Mr Martin Ebner's BZ banking group, which
owns 18 per cent of UBS's registered shares and 3 per cent of its bearers.
In the event, news that UBS planned to seek shareholder approval for a
single category of bearer share at an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on
November 22 came after the market had closed. The bank said its intention
was to prevent single shareholders of registered shares from having
'excessive influence'.
The SFr100 bearer shares rose SFr10 to SFr1,205 while the SFr20 registered
shares fell SFr6 to SFr324. BK Vision fell by SFr50 to SFr1,450.
MILAN encountered some profit-taking after the strong run of recent sessions
as budget optimism faded into the background and investors reflected on the
poor half-year figures from the banking sector, which came late on
Wednesday.
The Comit index fell 2.58 to 690.97. BCI dropped L121 to L3,960 while
Credito Italiano, which is also launching a capital increase, shed L96 to
2,150. The results of both were hit by losses on bond portfolios.
Telecom Italia, L53 lower at L4,496, lost out to Stet, L58 ahead at L4,970,
after the government said that the latter was its preferred privatisation
candidate.
Fiat gave up L97 to L6,731 as the market awaited its interim results after
the market closed. Analysts said later that, at first sight, the figures
were sharply better than had been expected.
AMSTERDAM closed at lunchtime to reroute telephone and computer cables for
today's launch of a new, computerised trading system.
The AEX Index closed 1.20 lower at 403.91, depressed by a weaker London
market and lower state bonds.
BolsWessanen eased 0.30 cents to Fl 34.70: the food and drinks group had
climbed Fl 1.70 on Wednesday on news it would take a stake of at least 33
per cent in Italy's Campari.
Among mixed blue chips, DSM, the chemicals group, fell Fl 2.30 to Fl 152.30
after Wednesday's strong gain.
Oce-van der Grinten rose Fl 1.30 to Fl 72.30, boosted by Wednesday's news of
a distribution deal in the US.
STOCKHOLM was weaker, tracking bonds and Wall Street. The Affarsvarlden
index lost 15.8 to 1,416.4. MoDo B closed SFr4 higher at SKr344, following
the company's announcement of a rise in fine paper prices.

FT  30 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei ahead as Taipei
rises 1% to four-year high
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tokyo
Buying by public pension and insurance funds, as well as investment trusts,
lifted Tokyo stocks, and the 225-share Nikkei average extended its recovery
with a rise of 107.52 to 19,615.12, agencies report.
The market ended off earlier highs after dealers adjusted their positions in
the late afternoon. Before that the Nikkei 225 had hit an intraday peak of
19,732.25, up from a low for the session of 19,559.01.
Volume declined from 287m shares to 263m. Advances outpaced falls by 647 to
322, with 208 issues unchanged. The Nikkei 300 put on 1.50 at 288.69 and the
Topix index of all first section stocks gained 6.68 at 1,576.27. The second
section index, which lost 12.00 on Wednesday, rallied 11.20 to 2,230.63. In
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 3.86 to 1,294.17.
Professionals said the Nikkei 225's failure to break through 19,800, and
caution ahead of today's deadline for the Japan-US trade talks, triggered
the dealers' adjustments.
Many investors doubted that the rise could continue for long. 'Share prices
rise only when public funds step into the market to buy. This is an
unhealthy market,' said a broker at a second-tier securities house.
However, other brokers said buying will continue today, as books are closed
at the half-year stage. Public funds, they added, will aim to keep the
Nikkei and the Topix above their closing levels on March 31, the annual book
closing day for many houses.
On March 31 this year the Nikkei 225 ended at 19,111.92 and the Topix at
1,563.21.
Among the sectors, steels and electricals saw the major gains, while the key
declines were in electric power, railway/bus, non-ferrous metal, real estate
and warehousing.
Steels enjoyed buying by public funds, Nippon Steel adding Y7 at Y392,
Kawasaki Y9 at Y447, NKK Y4 at Y292 and Sumitomo Metal Industries Y7 at
Y350. There was some speculation that South Korea's Pohang Iron and Steel
Co's output could be affected by an accident at its main plant on Tuesday,
although a Posco spokesman said operations were now running completely
normal.
Electricals reflected the yen's overnight drop against the dollar, prompted
by growing optimism among some dealers over the outcome of the US-Japan
trade talks. Toshiba put on Y5 at Y753, Mitsubishi Electric Y6 at Y706, NEC
Y20 at Y1,200 and Fujitsu Y10 at Y1,050.
On the second section, the newly listed Japan Telecom rallied to Y4.01m,
after a new low of Y3.95m on Wednesday.
Roundup
Many of the Pacific Rim markets were under pressure.
TAIPEI, however, moved ahead 1.0 per cent to close at a four-year high on
demand for financials and lower-priced blue chips by institutions. The
weighted index rose 72.03 to 7,101.13 in moderate turnover of TDollars
68.88bn.
Financials, rebounding from Tuesday's fall, had ICBC surging TDollars 6 or
6.3 per cent to TDollars 102.
SYDNEY was initially unsettled by bond weakness and worse than expected
current account data before prices bounced back later in the day, leaving
the All Ordinaries index a net 16.4 up at 2,030.6.
The banks sub-group index gained 1.1 per cent, while the oil and gas sector
advanced 3.6 per cent, mainly due to a strong performance by Woodside
Petroleum. Shares in the oil explorer jumped 33 cents or 7.3 per cent to
ADollars 4.87 amid speculation that the company would announce positive
testing results at its 50 per cent-owned exploration well in the Timor Sea
offshore Northern Australia.
Broken Hill Proprietary, which holds a 25 per cent stake in the oil well,
finished 14 cents stronger at ADollars 19.70.
SINGAPORE rose on active foreign buying of blue chips as overseas
institutions returned to the market. The Straits Times Industrial index
gained 18.21 at 2,348.90 in volume of 310m shares. Sembawang added 60 cents
at SDollars 12.10 and Keppel rose 30 cents to SDollars 12.20.
MANILA rebounded in a technical rally on the strength of a 2.8 per cent rise
in Philippine Long Distance Telephone.
The composite index moved up 14.27 to 2,897.96 as PLDT appreciated 40 pesos
to 1,460 pesos.
HONG KONG finished flat after an early, futures related buying spree ran out
of steam. The Hang Seng index closed just 6.72 firmer at 9,700.21 after a
high of 9,817.51. Volume improved to HKDollars 3.67bn from Wednesday's
HKDollars 2.98bn.
Index heavyweights dominated trade, with HSBC unchanged at HKDollars 88
after touching HKDollars 89.25 and Hong Kong Telecom flat at HKDollars
15.70, off a high of HKDollars 15.95.
Sino Land, which will join the index in February, climbed 30 cents to
HKDollars 9.025 on expectations of a good earnings statement later in the
day.
SEOUL edged lower as a continued consolidation of blue chips outweighed
gains by selective issues with good earnings prospects.
The composite index ended 2.24 off at 1,037.55 in volume that dropped to
42.9m shares from the previous day's 53.17m.
Analysts noted that institutional investors, whose fiscal year ends in
March, had sold heavily over the past two days to book profits before the
fiscal half-year finishes at the end of this month.
BANGKOK saw selling accelerate as the SET index dipped below the 1,480
support level in morning trade, before prices stabilised. The index picked
up from the day's low of 1,473.11 to finish a net 11.55 down at 1,482.12 in
turnover of Bt6.7bn.
Sitca Finance and Securities fell Bt10 to Bt95 on news that it was not
granted a full brokerage licence.
KUALA LUMPUR extended losses as profit-taking weighed on prices throughout
the day and the composite index slipped 7.15 to 1,133.68, tak-ing the week's
decline to date to 36.64.
Brokers said they expected further technical selling after the recent strong
run-up, adding that sentiment was also dented by continuing rumours of an
impending increase in local interest rates.
SHANGHAI's A share index dropped 77.90 or 8.3 per cent to 865.33 as
investors registered disappointment at the lack of market stimulating news
from the Communist Party meeting in Beijing. The index of B shares,
available to foreign investors, dipped 0.59 to 81.53.
The Shenzhen A index weakened 21.94 or 9.4 per cent to 211.38 and the B
index was 2.49 or 2.0 per cent down at 119.89.
BOMBAY saw a continuation of selling pressure amid concerns about the spread
of plague and its impact on foreign investment, and a fall in India's
overseas listed shares. The BSE 30-share index closed 50.19 lower at
4,358.30.
WELLINGTON was modestly firmer on improved turnover, with attention
remaining on leading stocks, while smaller issues faded into the background.
The NZSE-40 Capital index edged forward 3.95 to 2,972.55.

FT  30 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Gold puts cap on S Africa
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Johannesburg finished mixed in mostly light trade as a softer bullion price
slowed recovery attempts after heavy losses earlier this week.
Currency factors were also seen plaguing sentiment, with uncertainty about
the future of the financial rand keep-ing some investors out of the market.
However, other investors were seen picking up export-related stocks in
anticipation of the scrapping of the financial rand, since the expected
resultant weakness in the commercial rand rate would boost earnings of those
companies.
The overall index lost 1 at 5,638 after initially slipping to 5,623. Golds
ended 37 or 1.5 per cent off at 2,427 and industrials added 21 at 6,270.
De Beers was flat at R100, but Anglos slipped R1.50 to R235.50 in line with
its gold exposure. Gencor moved up 25 cents to R14.75 and SAB put on 50
cents at R83.50.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Markets Report: Trade talk nervousness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong US economic statistics and the Bundesbank's decision to leave
interest rates unchanged failed to lift the foreign exchange markets out of
their pre-weekend torpor yesterday, writes Philip Coggan.
Trade was thin ahead of the weekend's expected announcement on US-Japan
trade talks and the meeting of G7 finance ministers.
The US has set today as the deadline for a trade deal, after which it will
impose sanctions. A failure of the talks is expected to be bad news for the
dollar. But even a success-ful outcome may not necessarily prove a boost for
the US currency.
Mr Julian Simmons, managing director, foreign exchange and money markets
(Europe) at Citibank, said: 'My personal view is that whatever is agreed
will be seen as a compromise and I do not expect the dollar to rally too
much. I think the upside for the dollar against the yen is really quite
limited.'
Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS, commented: 'The US
and Japan have to convince the market that the issue is now dead. If they do
not do that, the dollar is going to be vul-nerable.'
Analysts did not expect the markets to show signs of life until the result
of the US-Japan talks was known. 'No-one wants to take a position ahead of
the outcome,' said one trader.
Mr Rob Hayward, economic adviser at Bank of America, said the meeting of G7
finance ministers this weekend had created the background fear that the
authorities might try to help the dollar. 'But I do not think that is a
credible idea,' he added.
The dollar closed in London at Y98.505, down slightly from Y98.720 on
Wednesday, and also finished lower at DM1.5458 from Wednesday's DM1.5467. It
ended New York trading at Y98.600 and DM1.5487.
A series of statistics indicating that US economic growth continued to be
strong had an adverse effect on the bond market, but appeared to have little
impact on the dollar.
US second-quarter gross domestic product growth was revised upwards from 3.8
per cent to 4.1 per cent. The main cause of upward revision was the largest
rise in inventories in 6 1/2 years. However, this figure is now largely a
matter of historical interest and the key number will be the rate of
third-quarter growth.
More significant may have been the announcement that jobless claims in the
week to September 24 were 310,000, the lowest figure this year and down from
a revised 321,000 in the previous week.
Mr Cunningham said the 'further decline in initial claims figures may cause
some to revise upwards their forecasts of non-farm payrolls', which will be
announced a week from today. A strong payroll number will put pressure on
the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, which it declined to do earlier
this week.
Further signs of US economic strength were shown when August homes sales
were reported to have risen by 9.7 per cent.
The Bundesbank kept official rates unchanged yesterday and announced another
two fixed rate repos at 4.85 per cent. The German bank's inaction did not
come as a surprise to foreign exchange markets.
'The Bundesbank is attempting to paint a picture of stab-ility ahead of the
election,' said UBS's Mr Cunningham. But analysts fear that the D-Mark could
suffer in the run-up to the October elections, with doubts about the
electoral prospects of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition partner, the FDP.
Three-month German interest rates are now below those in the US, having
started the year with a gap of more than 250 basis points in the D-Mark's
favour, but this shift has done little for the health of the dollar.
The Italian lira gained slightly on the back of a statement from Mr Umberto
Bossi, the leader of the Northern League party, who described the 1995
Budget as 'fair and strong', thereby increasing the chance of its passage
through parliament. The lira closed in London at L1,005/DM, from L1,007 on
Wednesday.
Sterling was on the sidelines for most of the day but ended marginally ahead
against both the D-Mark and dollar. Against the German currency, its close
of DM2.4443 led analysts to hope that it could make an attempt on the DM2.45
level. Against the dollar it edged up to Dollars 1.5810 from Dollars 1.5784.
South Africa's Reserve Bank governor Mr Chris Stals said in an interview
that market conditions had become more favourable for the abolition of the
financial rand.
In London, the financial rand finished at R4.22/Dollars , compared with
R4.225 on Wednesday, while the commercial rand fell back to R3.5673/Dollars
from Wednesday's R3.5548.
In the UK money markets, the Bank of England said it provided help in two
tranches of Pounds 20m and Pounds 440m. That compared with a forecast
shortage of Pounds 500m, revised down from earlier estimates of Pounds 600m
and Pounds 700m. Overnight rates moved within a range of 6 1/4 per cent to 4
7/8 per cent.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian uranium mining curbs
to stay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
There will be no immediate relaxation of Australia's constraints on uranium
mining, and the issue has been referred to the ruling Australian Labour
Party's national executive for consideration in three years' time.
The sidestep, which was agreed yesterday at the ALP's national conference in
Hobart, follows a week of uncertainly as advocates of a more liberal uranium
policy sought to secure support for the opening of new mines.
The ALP has a long-standing policy of restricting uranium mining to three
sites. However, one of these mines is now worked out, and a second is
approaching exhaustion. This situation, coupled with the desire of some
Aborigine representatives to see uranium mining expanded in the Northern
Territory, led to serious speculation that a change in policy could be
agreed.
Throughout the week, it had been touch-and-go whether pro-mining supporters
could raise enough votes from delegates to the conference. On Wednesday
night, many political commentators thought they had achieved the objective,
although any new mine would have been bound to employ union labour - a
condition designed to penalise CRA, the Australian mining group, which has
been seeking to employ workers on individual staff contracts.
Yesterday morning, however, a number of Victorian and Queensland delegates
shifted in favour of the status quo. Last night, Mr Brian Ede, the Northern
Territory opposition leader who had pushing hard for a change, estimated
that - had the matter gone to a vote - 48 delegates would have been in
favour of a change, compared with 54 against.
Australia is reckoned to have about 30 per cent of the western world's
low-cost uranium reserves but produces only about 10 per cent of the western
world's supply. The two projects that are operating under the three-mines
policy are Olympic Dam, owned by Western Mining Corporation, and Ranger,
belonging to Energy Resources of Australia.
Had policy been relaxed, projects most likely to go ahead would have
included Koongarra and North Ranger/Jabiluka, both in Northern Territory.
However, given the current low level of uranium prices, analysts believed
that most mining companies would have been in no rush to open up new mines,
although they added that there was a fair chance that additional projects
would have come on stream over the next decade.
Last night, ERA said it was extremely disappointed at the ALP's decision to
retain the status quo. It said that, in conjunction with Aborigine owners,
it would approach the government between conferences and continue to push
for the development of new ore bodies.
'In the interim, ERA will continue to develop its existing deposits on the
Ranger lease as the market recovers. However, this may mean that we will
have to supplement our production with overseas purchases if we experience
production limits in a buoyant market,' it commented.

FT  30 SEP 94 / World Commodities Prices: Copper support level breached -
Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Technical selling of COPPER was triggered at the London Metal Exchange after
the breaching of support at Dollars 2,550 a tonne for three months delivery
and a short-term trend line at Dollars 2,540. By the close of afternoon ring
trading the price had reached Dollars 2,530.75, down Dollars 37.75 on the
day, but some of the loss was recovered in after hours activity.
'The break below Dollars 2,550 sparked stop-loss selling and long
liquidation before some covering and bargain hunting emerged to halt the
decline,' one dealer said.
Other LME metals came off the boil in line with copper but appeared to be
finding some underlying support.
The GOLD price ended 50 cents down at Dollars 395 a troy ounce at the London
bullion market after bouncing off solid support at Dollars 394.
Russia's state Precious Metals Committee yesterday disowned Wednesday's
statement by one of its senior officials that the country planned to stop
exporting gold. But the statement, which initially prompted a sharp fall in
the price, had already been largely discounted in the market.
'Russia's presence on world gold markets has a long tradition and it is very
stable,' said Mr Leonid Gurevich, a deputy chairman of the committee.
London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures ended down but off day lows after
roaster buying helped cushion the effects of arbitrage selling linked to a
slide in New York.
The November position closed at Dollars 3,891 a tonne, down Dollars 90,
after touching Dollars 3,880 at one point.
'There has been good arbitrage selling all day and yet the market has held
up really well,' one trader commented. The Brazilian weather factor had
moved into the background for the time being, others said.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian organisation seeks role
in aluminium revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Vami Institute, the St Petersburg-based organisation that designed all
the former Soviet Union's aluminium smelters, is making a determined attempt
to play an important role in the coming revolution in the Russian aluminium
industry.
Several western aluminium companies are jockeying for positions in the
Russian industry, which needs to replace or substantially refurbish its
smelters. It seems possible that some western money will be available for
this purpose following the recent trade agreement between the European Union
and five big aluminium-producing countries which involved Russia agreeing to
cut output. The Russian smelters are also expected to develop downstream
fabricating activities so that Russia will consume more of the aluminium it
produces.
Vami, privatised in 1992, has appointed a new director, Mr Valery Lankin,
and he has set his sights on establishing long-term arrangements with
western groups. To this end, Vami is shortly to set up offices in New York
and London.
Mr Igor Platonov, Vami's foreign affairs director, said: 'All the CIS
smelters were built to our designs and all western companies need to consult
with us if they intend to do work at the smelters.' Vami had already been
invited to take part in smelter refurbishment schemes by two US companies,
Kaiser Aluminum and Reynolds Metals and been contacted by Pechiney of
France.
As the sole aluminium technical establishment in the former Soviet Union,
Vami has some of the most up-to-date equipment in the world. Mr Platonov
said it intends to offer some of its new technology to western companies -
including that for composite materials, aluminium powders, very high purity
aluminium, the production of alumina from very low quality bauxite and the
production of magnesium from different sources.
Vami now has just over 1,000 employees, down from 2,200 four years ago.
Employees now own 31 per cent of the institute and the central government
intends soon to sell its remaining 20 per cent by auction.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: CAP report sends tremors
through Brussels - Lionel Barber examines a controversial proposal for
wholesale farm policy reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A minor earthquake erupted in Brussels yesterday. The European Commission
released an independent study which recommends wholesale reform of the
Common Agricultural Policy, including scrapping farm production quotas and
set-aside payments to farmers.
The commission's decision to publish and be damned breaks a Brussels taboo
on talking about further CAP reform. Not everyone, it seems, is satisfied
with the present step-by-step changes in the policy, which consumes half of
the EU's Ecu70bn (Pounds 55bn) annual budget.
The question is whether the 200-page report - called EC Agricultural Policy
for the 21st Century and drawn up by a group of independent agricultural
experts from Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Sweden and the UK -
is destined to gather dust on an academic shelf; or whether it signals the
start of a fresh debate about the future of the CAP, which many believe is
inevitable if the EU is serious about enlargement to the farm-intensive
economies of central Europe.
This week, the commission made clear that it does not endorse the report's
conclusions. Mr Bruno Dethomas, chief spokesmen, noted that the EU was still
digesting the 1992 McSharry reforms, which moved the CAP away from price
support to direct income support for farmers as an incentive to reduce
rampant overproduction. To embark on reforms every 18 months would
'masochistic', he said.
This echoes the standard line from DG6, the agriculture directorate, which
has held an iron grip on the CAP since its inception. What is now clear is
that officials in DG2 - the economics and financial directorate - used the
device of commissioning an independent study as a means of breaking this
grip and stimulating debate.
The report's authors - who include Mr Arne Larson, a former chef de cabinet
to Mr Finn Gundelach, a celebrated Danish vice president of the European
Commission in the 1970s - are careful to avoid repeating the familiar
Anglo-Saxon criticism of the CAP as an expensive racket designed to coddle
Europe's farmers, coupled with ritual calls for EU prices to fall to world
levels.
Though the report is merciless in exposing the inefficiencies of the present
system, its new element turns on the application of 'subsidiarity' - the
principle of devolving decision-making to the lowest appropriate national
and regional level, which is enshrined in the Maastricht treaty - to
agricultural policy.
Thus, the authors recommend that EU farm subsidies should be phased into
national budgets over seven to ten years. Member states - not Brussels -
would assume responsibility for direct income supports, a move that the
authors argue is a logical extension of the McSharry reforms.
Second, those countries suffering heavy penalties through loss of EU
financial aid could be compensated through increased contributions from the
regional, social and 'cohesion' funds, which are set up to assist poorer
areas.
The most serious objection is that 'renationalisation' of agriculture would
encourage even more cheating by member states and ultimately destroy the
single market. But the authors' have an answer: a reinforced competition
policy to monitor state aids.
Their idea is to create a new 'common organisation' that would involve
member states producing multi-annual plans for direct income support to
farmers, to be discussed and approved in the Council of Ministers - a little
like the present arrangements for monitoring the use of structural funds or
regional aid.
The time-bomb ticking here, of course, is that the new mechanism would
signal a further diminution of the European Commission as supra-national
authority. But again the authors propose a sweetener:
'For a CAP reform proposal to be adopted, it is important that the
distribution of costs and benefits between member states does not
dramatically change as a result of its implementation, and that it is
perceived in each member state not to do so.'
Second, member states would 'in general' be free to provide compensation
based on historical levels of production because such payments do not
provide an incentive to increased production, according to the report.
Third, the report acknowledges that certain rural communities are still
highly dependent and vulnerable, and therefore should receive aid on the
same basis as other sectors in remote areas or countryside.
Despite these reassurances, the report can expect rough handling from
Europe's farm lobby, particularly in France. Moreover, member states could
expect to contribute hefty amounts of money from their national budgets in
the initial phase of the reforms because of the need to support market
prices.
However, the report predicts that price developments over the next few years
will lead to cereal prices approaching world prices quite closely, so that
no set-aside may be needed to comply with the Gatt Uruguay Round - a
prediction widely voiced by CAP reformers in 1992.
Perhaps the most telling message in the report is the need for the EU to
prepare for the next round of enlargement to central and eastern Europe.
'The CAP in its present form is not only a complication to the development
of free trade with eastern Europe, it would also be a source of great
difficulty to any eventual attempt by the EU to honour its commitment to
take the Czech republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland into membership.'
So far, the commission has approached the relation between the CAP and
enlargement with great care. Earlier this year, another independent study
chaired by Mr Henri Nallet, a former French farm minister, and Mr Adrian van
Stolk, a Dutch authority on trade and agriculture, proposed setting up a new
system to help support stable farm prices in eastern Europe at near world
price levels. It warned that falling prices would lead to a dangerous lack
of investment and access to credit.
Some officials and diplomats in Brussels believe that the approach of the
CAP's extension eastwards is merely postponing the hard decisions and
storing up political trouble. Hence the need for what one eastern European
diplomat calls a 'Copernican revolution' - a radical rethink of the
principles and operation of the policy.
This week's report will appear in the next issue of European Economy, the
commission's economics journal.
Whatever its future, it has at least started the ball rolling.

The price decline continued at this week's Australian and New Zealand sales,
and has now wiped out many of the grains made earlier in the season. The
market indicators in Australia registered average falls of 37 and 38 cents
on Tuesday, the largest so far. By today, however, merino values appeared to
be stabilising, offering hope of a new price basis. The bigger offerings in
Australia tested the market thoroughly, and no more than 70 per cent was
sold in some cases. At Wednesday's sale in Bradford British wools were five
per cent cheaper and the clearance was only 65 per cent. The Bradford market
is very quiet and quotations for tops have been reduced

FT  30 SEP 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries fall on further signs of
economic strength
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury bonds fell sharply again yesterday as traders reacted to further
signs of economic strength.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  5/16 lower
at 96 1/32 , with the yield rising to 7.839 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was down  1/8 at 99 27/32 , to yield 6.568 per cent.
The downturn followed the release of another set of data which could bring
forward the next increase in short-term interest rates.
With the Federal Reserve believed to be poised to tighten monetary policy
again, the Commerce Department reported that new home sales had jumped by
9.7 per cent last month to an annual rate of 703,000, against an adjusted
July pace of 641,000. Separately, it revised its estimate of second-quarter
gross domestic product up to 4.1 per cent, from 3.8 per cent.
The readings bode poorly for the next round of first-tier reports, which may
confirm that the economy is still accelerating.
The market is also growing anxious about the dollar, as the deadline for
completing US-Japanese trade negotiations draws closer. Bond traders were
disturbed after hearing of comments by Mr Fred Bergsten, director of the
Institute of International Economics.
Mr Bergsten said the dollar could fall sharply against the yen if the talks
collapse and the Clinton administration follows through on threats to impose
retaliatory sanctions.
Meanwhile, a weaker dollar could aggravate inflation by making imports more
expensive. That trend was evident in yesterday's news that import prices
climbed 0.6 per cent in August, while export prices were up 0.2 per cent.
Amid these concerns, the yield on the long bond touched its highest level of
the year at 7.87 per cent, but later it receded as the price climbed off the
session low.
European government bond markets dipped yesterday, pulled down by the US
Treasury market. The Bundesbank council's decision yesterday to leave key
German interest rates unaltered was widely expected.
UK gilt prices slipped slightly in slow trading. Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK
economist at Midland Global Markets, said: 'It is a very quiet day - there
is no news to move the market.'
One feature which prompted some comment was the price at which a tranche of
stock was removed from the market.
The tranche, Pounds 150m of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked bonds due 2016, was
sold at 137 1/8 . Some analysts pointed out that this was  1/16 points above
the price in the market.
Another Pounds 100m tranche of 2 per cent index-linked stock due 2006 was
sold around the market price of 167 1/16 . The tranches were announced on
August 25.
This week's 8 1/2 per cent due 2005 auction stock fell from around 97 5/8 to
around 97 17/32 , to yield 8.83 per cent, a rise in yield of around 3 basis
points.
German bunds drifted through the morning and followed US Treasuries down in
the afternoon, with the December bund future around 89.22 in late trading,
down 0.35 points.
According to Mr Christoph Anhamm, a bond analyst at Union Bank of
Switzerland in Frankfurt: 'The market is likely to continue in range-bound
trading. Investors are waiting for the result of the election on October 16.
Until then, sentiment will be very fragile.'
Mr Anhamm pointed out that, while around a week ago the yield on the 10-year
German bund was about 30 basis points above that of the comparable US
Treasury, by yesterday it had moved to about 20 basis points below.
'Investors may have realised that the central banks are going in different
directions,' he added.

The eurobond market saw a flurry of new issues in a variety of currencies
yesterday, despite falls in government bond prices.
Korea Development Bank launched a Dollars 500m global offering of 10-year
bonds amid volatile conditions in the dollar sector. The bonds, which were
priced to yield 80 basis points over US Treasuries, were widely distributed,
with Europe and the US each accounting for 40 per cent of sales and Asia for
the remainder, lead manager CS First Boston said.
'There was some buying of the bonds by UK accounts and by Far Eastern
investors looking to swap back into fixed-rate yen, for example,' said one
syndicate manager. 'But the dollar sector is lethargic at the moment, with
spreads widening across all maturities, and some investors were put off by
the Korean political risk.'
Most syndicate managers thought the bonds were fairly priced, although some
said that some US accounts had been looking for extra yield for an issue of
this size, which is small for a global offering.
In the D-Mark sector, the European Investment Bank launched a DM1bn offering
of eight-year bonds fungible with an existing tranche of bonds issued in
October 1992.
The issue, priced to yield 15 basis points over German bunds, was sold
mainly to European institutional investors, lead manager Westdeutsche
Landesbank said.
An official at the EIB said: 'We expect this issue to be enough for us not
to go back to the D-Mark market this year but it is very difficult to
predict.' The proceeds from the offering were not swapped out of D-Marks, he
said.
Syndicate managers said demand for the bonds was slow. 'The D-Mark sector is
reviving but it is still difficult to push long-dated issues, especially
after the recent pick up in supply,' said one syndicate official.
The Kingdom of Belgium and the African Development Bank tapped the D-Mark
sector earlier this week, and the World Bank is expected to launch a global
D-Mark offering next week.
In the French franc sector, the Kingdom of Sweden launched a FFr2bn offering
of fixed-rate two-year bonds, priced to yield 18 basis points over
government bonds.
Lead manager Banque Paribas said 70 per cent of the bonds were sold to
institutions and fund managers outside of France. 'They bought them on an
asset-swap basis, swapping the bonds into floating-rate French francs,' it
said.
The Republic of Iceland is expected to launch its debut euroyen offering
soon, market sources said. The Y5bn to Y6bn offering will be of five-year
bonds, they said.
Statkraft, the Norwegian state-owned electricity generator, is set to launch
its debut eurobond offering over the coming weeks. The issue is likely to be
a fixed rate D-Mark offering, of around DM300m, of five or 10-year bonds,
lead manager Deutsche Bank said.

FT  30 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Invesco plans Dalian fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Invesco, the international fund management group, is planning to launch a
fund investing in Dalian, the port and industrial zone in north-east China.
Dalian established an economic and technical development zone 10 years ago,
and has attracted more than 3,000 foreign enterprises. Last year it
processed imports and exports worth more than Dollars 4.3bn.
Invesco Asia has signed a memorandum of understanding with the municipal
government of Dalian to set up and manage a fund investing in about 25
unlisted companies in the region. Fund managers have so far narrowed a
potential pool of 120 companies down to a short-list of 50.
The fund is mostly likely to take the form of a closed-end vehicle, possibly
listed in Hong Kong, but that will depend on tax considerations.

FT  30 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Trading reformed on Amsterdam
SE
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Amsterdam Stock Exchange is scheduled to open an hour later than normal
today to allow brokers, banks and jobbers to cope with wide-ranging reforms
to the bourse's trading system.
When trading begins at 10:30am, the exchange will be split into retail and
wholesale sectors for the first time, forcing the jobbers, known as
'hoekmen' in Dutch, to adjust to a new role as market specialists along the
lines of their counterparts on the New York Stock Exchange.
The stock exchange closed at noon yesterday, 4 1/2 hours ahead of its normal
closing time, to enable workmen to re-route telephone lines and also to give
brokerage houses and jobbers the time to reprogramme their computer screens.
The Amsterdam reforms, introduced after years of debate and controversy, are
designed to help the Dutch capital recapture trading in Dutch equities that
has seeped over the years to London.
'We need and want to confirm our role as the price leader in Dutch
equities,' the exchange's chairman, Baron Boudewijn van Ittersum, said.
The changes will allow Amsterdam to retain its trading floor for retail
orders, where transactions are based on matching supply and demand through a
central auction system.
However, at the same time it will be trying to compete with Seaq
International in London by introducing two screen-based systems for the new
quote-driven wholesale market.
One of the screen systems will enable market-makers to advertise bid prices,
the other will allow them to trade directly on screen. The new-style
'hoekman' will be expected to act as an arbitrageur between the two systems
and, effectively, link them together.
Mr van Ittersum said Amsterdam chose to launch the new system on a Friday so
it could iron out any problems that developed over the weekend in time for
Monday.
Eventually, once regulatory and other issues are resolved, foreign brokers
and banks will be able to trade on the Amsterdam exchange from their bases
in London or from other financial centres.

FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: Restructuring at Alitalia starts
to bear fruit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Alitalia, Italy's state controlled airline, recorded a first-half loss of
L242bn (Dollars 155m) amid the first signs that a tough restructuring
programme is bearing fruit.
Although Alitalia made a L214bn loss during the same period in 1993, the
figure was distorted by an exceptional revenues of L112bn from assets sales,
mainly aircraft. Part of this year's loss referred to L45bn covering staff
redundancies.
Staff numbers fell 3 per cent to 18,113 and the process of rationalisation
is expected to lead to a further substantial pruning of the workforce,
especially ground staff. The company has also begun to persuade cabin crew
to adopt more flexible work practices; also allowing for more efficient use
of existing aircraft.
The number of passengers rose 11 per cent to 6.56m, compared to the average
increase of 9.1 per cent among the Association of European Airlines. The
load factor rose by 4.8 points to 66.9 per cent.
'Operating results have improved thanks to a significant increase in traffic
carried, generating a higher load factor, coupled with a visible reduction
of costs and expenses,' said Mr Roberto Schisano, managing director.
'Sales revenue increased by 12.7 per cent while costs and expenses increased
by 6.6 per cent, ' added Mr Schisano, who was brought in earlier this year
to be chief executive.
Gross operating margins almost doubled to L115bn. Investments during the
period totalled L830bn while debt rose marginally to L2,388bn.

FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: Bankers urge risk disclosure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banks and brokers should publish the findings of internal studies into their
exposures to swings in financial markets, according to a paper from a group
of central bankers released yesterday.
The report, from the so-called Group of 10 leading central banks, argues
that the gap between the banks' and brokers' understanding of the risks they
are running, and that of the market, has grown in recent years as complex
derivative markets have expanded and risk management practices have moved
on.
The call from the central bankers, though couched in the form of a
'discussion paper', will add to pressure on financial firms in the leading
financial centres to increase disclosure about their risk profiles.
At present, securities and accounting regulators in a number of countries
are developing rules which would call for greater disclosure in this area.
But the G10 paper argues that financial intermediaries should not wait for
specific regulations but should act immediately to disclose more
information.
'During episodes of market stress, (the current) lack of transparency can
contribute to an environment in which rumours alone can cause a firm's
market access and funding to be impaired,' the paper warns.
The central bankers appear to have been prompted in part by the sort of
instability that threatened the financial markets earlier this year, when
institutions like Bankers Trust were forced to issue public denials as
rumours spread that they were facing bankruptcy.
The discussion paper, Public Disclosure of Market and Credit Risks by
Financial Intermediaries, could also be used as a basis for disclosure by
other companies which have active treasury departments, the G10 group adds.
The paper calls for disclosure, in summary form, of the market risks in an
institution's portfolio of securities and its success in managing these
risks. It also recommends disclosure of the scale of counterparty credit
risk arising from trading and risk management activities.

FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: US banks 'in lending frenzy' -
FT Conferences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A warning that US banks are in a 'feeding frenzy' to lend to large
companies, and have started to sacrifice credit standards in exchange for
short-term earnings, was given yesterday by Mr Richard Boyle, vice-chairman
of Chase Manhattan Bank.
Mr Boyle told a Financial Times conference on international banking in
Madrid that high levels of capital and liquidity had sharpened competition
in syndicated lending.
A 'lemming mentality' had returned and benchmarks of proper risk and reward
'have been replaced by the spectre of what the competition is doing', said
Mr Boyle, who is in charge of credit policy at Chase.
He said regulation was encouraging excess capacity. 'There has been far too
little deregulation than is really needed to ensure the healthy banking
environment that regulators should espouse.'
Mr Michael Foley, a senior analyst at Moody's Investor Services, said that
despite worries about syndicated loans, improvements in risk and portfolio
management had lessened US banks' risks from credit defaults.
Mr Foley said that although interest margins were likely to narrow in the
long-term in the US, banks had maintained strong margins in the first half
of the year despite the rise in US short-term interest rates.
Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank, said that banks in
mature economies 'where there is high capacity in the market and a strong
consumerist lobby' would have have to seek international growth.
Lesser-developed countries, 'some of which are developing extremely
speedily, may offer more dramatic prospects of new and profitable business
but with great risk of high inflation and economic volatility'.
Lord Alexander said banks were 'like chameleons: they are coloured by
changing economic environments'. When the next downturn occurred, the
successful banks would be those that anticipated it and adapted themselves.
Derivatives losses such as those suffered by Metallgesellschaft suggested
that 'a corporate treasury function would be well served by the advice of an
expert banker when dealing in complex financial instruments'.
Mr Emilio Botin, chairman of Banco Santander, suggested that banks could
help banking regulators by jointly developing methods of measuring the
impact of interest rate risks on the whole of balance sheets.
Mr Botin said he could see 'no more than half a dozen' banks that could
aspire to being truly global, but other banks could diversify their risks
and find new businesses through internationalisation.
He said that banks could develop links with telecommunications companies to
create new banking products, as well as linking with insurance companies to
provide 'bancassurance' products through branches.
Mr Gerrit Tammes, a member of the executive board of Internationale
Nederlanden Groep, said that in most European countries, banks were rapidly
increasing their share of the life insurance market.
There was a trend towards 'one-stop shopping' for financial services from a
single provider, but many consumers had 'lost their way in the labyrinth of
products, services, rules and regulations'.
He said that banks' best chance of success in 'bancassurance' was in asset
management.
Members of ageing populations were seeking investments with higher long-term
returns to substitute for state pensions.
Mr Horst Kohler, president of the German Savings Banks Association, argued
that the 1,500 savings banks, with 63,000 branches in Europe, were essential
to maintain both competition and local distribution of capital.
Many countries had discovered that large companies 'are not guarantors for
either jobs or tax revenues in local regions' and savings banks provided
local support to small and medium-sized enterprises.
He said the local role of savings banks' made them less likely to 'seek
opportunities solely in a highly detached financial sphere'.
Commercial banks were at risk of 'over-concentration on pure financial
business'.

<TEXT>
Mr Alfredo Saenz, chairman of Spain's Banesto, said yesterday that he was
prepared to be flexible about his bank's disputed shareholding in Portugal's
profitable Banco Totta &amp; Acores group, but that Banesto insisted on
maintaining management control of Totta.
Banesto owns 24.9 per cent of Totta and it has an indirect stake of 25 per
cent, placed with Portuguese portfolio companies, which is held in loans
with purchase options.
The Portuguese government has contested the Spanish bank's indirect holding
and the disputed equity is now the object of a parliamentary investigation
in Lisbon.
'We are legally in the clear for what we hold directly, there is nothing
illegal about the indirect equity and our position in Totta is backed by
European Union legislation,' Mr Saenz said.
He added that there was no question of Banesto relinquishing management
control of the Portuguese bank.
'We have control, we want to have it and we are not going to lose the
business.'
But Banesto's chairman conceded that the issue had become intensely
politicised and that it was 'uncomfortable' to be in confrontation with the
Portuguese authorities. 'We are therefore disposed to be flexible,' he said.
Under the guidelines of Totta's privatisation in 1989, no foreign
institution may own more than 25 per cent of the bank. The Portuguese
government holds 14.5 per cent.

Belgium's second largest holding company, Groupe Bruxelles Lambert,
announced a 6 per cent increase in consolidated profits from BFr4.2bn
(USDollars 132m) in the six months to June compared with BFr3.9bn in the
same period a year earlier.
Net earnings per share rose to BFr180 against BFr175 for the diversified
holding, which has interests in oil, the media, utilities, insurance and
banking.
Barring unforeseen events, the group should report an increased profit for
the whole year, which would allow it to pay an unchanged dividend.
The group has 21.8 per cent in Petrofina, the petrochemicals company, 20.3
per cent in Tractebel, the energy group, 13.1 per cent of Royal Belge, the
insurance company, 59.2 per cent of CLT, and 12.4 per cent of BBL, the
retail bank.
In June GBL announced an increase in its holding of Audiofina from 52.5 per
cent to 55.3 per cent as part of a restructuring of its majority
shareholding together with French media group Havas. GBL's investments have
reached BFr12bn since the beginning of the year.
Royale Belge announced that consolidated turnover amounted to BFr55.5bn, a
3.4 per cent increase on the same period a year ago.

<TEXT>
Denway Investments, which indirectly controls a 46 per cent interest in
Peugeot's car manufacturing business in Guangzhou, has reported a 90 per
cent drop in first-half net earnings, down to HKDollars 19m (USDollars
2.46m) from HKDollars 201m.
This is just a fraction of the HKDollars 132.9m earned in interest income
from its massively popular public offering last February. Setting a new
record in a market renowned for excess, Denway's issue was 657 times
oversubscribed pulling in HKDollars 240bn - or around one-third of Hong
Kong's GDP - for HKDollars 402m worth of stock.
Even stripping out last year's one-off interest income, profits were still
down by 68 per cent, which the group attributed to changing market
conditions in China. However, car sales fell only 17 per cent.
Earnings per share tumbled 92 per cent to 1.45 cents from 19.24 cents.
Directors are recommending an interim dividend of 0.5 cents.

FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: Russia's RNGS to sell shares

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in the Russian company JSC Rosneftegazstroy (RNGS), the legal
successor to the former Soviet ministry for oil and gas construction, are to
be offered to international institutional investors through a series of
private placements.
RNGS, advised by Geneva-based Rhone Finance, expects to raise up to Dollars
25.5m through the sale of 3.7 per cent of the company's shares. It has
permission to sell up to 10 per cent of the company.
Under the terms of the initial placement the shares will carry a fixed
dividend of 8 per cent, payable half-yearly - in US dollars - and will be
redeemable up to December 31, 2000. Funds from the private placements will
be used partly for real estate development in Moscow.
RNGS is a general contractor on oil and gas construction, municipal and
commercial construction and infrastructure development in Russia. It has
200,000 employees and has management control over 37 oil and gas companies
under a co-operation agreement with the ministry of fuel and energy.
Meanwhile, senior managers from five Russian self-styled 'blue chip'
companies yesterday presented details of recent performance and outlined
their companies' prospects to investors in London.

There were no fire crackers at yesterday's launch of Chinatrust
International Securities, the first Taiwanese investment bank to open for
business in the City of London. But that there was going to be plenty of
other razzmatazz was clear even before the official ceremony began.
Dr Jeffrey Koo, chairman of the new bank's parent in Taipei, picked his way
from room to room past a myriad of bright paper decorations and extravagant
floral displays while a brown and white police spaniel checked the premises
for bombs ahead of the arrival of his honoured guest - Lady Thatcher, the
former UK prime minister.
It was not a bad show for a group whose total banking assets are still only
Dollars 18bn, but then Chinatrust, which aims to become a global business
with a position in the ranks of the world's top 100 banks, is strikingly
long on ambition.
Founded with capital of just Dollars 2m in 1966, the parent bank only
acquired a Taiwanese commercial banking licence two years ago and is already
spreading its wings across Asia. It helps that Chinatrust is the flagship
financial vehicle of the Koo family, reckoned to be the second richest
family in Taiwan, whose industrial interests range from cement to
petrochemicals, hotels and cable television.
The ebullient Dr Koo, who is a senior adviser to Taiwan's prime minister and
says he met Lady Thatcher over dinner when she visited Taipei, obviously
knows how to cultivate connections. These will doubtless be put to good use
in the UK. The new investment bank aims to help Taiwanese companies raise
capital abroad through the issue of convertible bonds, to channel portfolio
investment into the Taiwanese market as well as to manage Taiwanese
investments in Europe.
It is a daunting task because, unlike the foreign securities companies which
are now established in Taipei, Chinatrust lacks securities distribution
capacity in Europe.
But Dr Koo says distribution will always be a problem for new entrants to
the market. London is a good place to start because about 30 to 40 per cent
of foreign investment in Taiwanese equities originates in the City.
Chinatrust believes it can sell its services on the basis of the quality of
its research. 'We can offer good advice to UK investors,' he says.
The limit on foreign investment in the Taiwanese market, set presently at
Dollars 7.5bn, should not be a problem. There is room for another Dollars
2bn in investments and the limit will be increased when the ceiling is
reached, he says confidently. It is simply that the pace has to be
controlled. 'When Japan started to liberalise it took them 10 years. We are
doing it at a very fast pace.'
Perhaps, however, Chinatrust will make its main initial mark in the bond
market. Dr Koo believes the interest of Taiwanese companies in issuing
convertible eurobonds is large and growing. While the Taiwanese government
controls the country's Dollars 90bn in foreign reserves, it is relatively
hard for private sector companies to raise foreign currency from domestic
banks.
The risk is that Taiwanese companies will set out on an issuing spree
similar to that undertaken by Japanese companies in the 1980s. As they
latched on to the low cost of borrowing in this way, the market became
saturated with paper which eventually proved a poor investment as the stock
market slid.
Yet Dr Koo believes there is a difference. Whereas Taiwanese companies tend
to raise funds for specific projects, many Japanese issuers were simply
following the herd. 'When the bubble economy burst, they still had to bear
the cost no matter how cheap the money.
'The Taiwanese will never do that. They are more pragmatic. They will never
raise funds just to feel comfortable.'

FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: Earnings jump at Sino Land
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sino Land, the property development and investment company which is to
become a constituent of the Hang Seng Index in February, yesterday reported
a 64 per cent surge in net profits to HKDollars 1.48bn (USDollars 191.7m)
for the year to June 30, compared with HKDollars 900.59m in 1992-93.
Shareholders are to receive a one-for-10 bonus share issue in addition to a
final dividend of 16 cents. The dividend may be taken in new shares or cash.
Earnings per share, on a fully diluted basis, rose 47 per cent to 63.8 cents
from 43.3 cents.
Sino Land, traditionally one of Hong Kong's most aggressive property
developers, bought eight sites with a potential gross floor area of around
1.3m sq ft in the year. It now has a land bank of some 12.7m sq ft, of which
seven projects are to come on stream in 1994-95.
The group is stepping up its investment in industrial properties and is
planning to modify some of its better located sites into industrial/office
developments to meet growing demand.
Around one-third of the land bank is made up of investment properties, and
gross rental income last year rose 15 per cent to HKDollars 758.7m.
The total value of the group's investment properties stood at HKDollars
25.4bn at the end of the financial year, an increase of 70 per cent.
Mr Robert Ng, chairman, expects rental income to play an increasingly
important part in group profitability.
Sino Land plans to spin off its hotel interests in a separate listing, and
yesterday submitted a formal application for the listing of the new
hospitality arm, Newco.
Mr Ng noted that while steps to cool the property market - taken by both the
government and the banks, which lend up to a maximum 70 per cent of property
values - had proved to be effective, the fundamentals of sound economic
growth, rising real incomes and a shortage of land mean properties remain an
attractive investment.

FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: Kenya to allow foreign bids in
Firestone public share offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NAIROBI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Central Bank of Kenya is to allow foreign institutional investors to bid
for shares in the public flotation of a Kenyan company for the first time in
the history of the Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE).
The owners of Firestone East Africa (1969), the only tyre manufacturer in
Kenya, are offering 20 per cent of the company's shares for sale in the
biggest initial public offering in Kenya to date.
If the offer for sale is fully subscribed, it will raise Ks1.4bn (Dollars
27.9m) for Bridgestone/Firestone Inc of the US and Sameer Investments of
Kenya, which own 19 per cent and 81 per cent of the local tyre manufacturer
respectively.
The offer has been priced at 10 times 1993 earnings, which is comparable
with other manufacturing companies listed on the NSE.
The Kenyan stock market is still officially closed to foreign participation
regulations but Firestone East Africa obtained a special exemption due to
the size of the share offer.
'We believe the government is using Firestone as a test case to assess the
interest and the impact of overseas investors in our stock market,' said Mr
Issa Timamy, group company secretary at Sameer Investments. With at least
two local banks planning flotations before the end of the year, Mr Timamy
believes the central bank will gradually relax the rules of foreign
participation.
The restrictions on foreign portfolio investment are virtually the last
foreign exchange controls to remain following a year of steady deregulation.
The Kenya shilling is fully convertible for all current account
transactions. Exporters can retain proceeds in foreign currency and
multinationals can remit profits and dividends.
Nevertheless, the central bank is proceeding cautiously. Only 8m shares  -
one-fifth of the offer - will be available to overseas bidders, who must be
institutional investors. Underlying central bank concern is possible
disruption caused by large flows of foreign funds on a small, illiquid stock
market.
Daily turnover on the NSE rarely exceeds Ks21m and the NSE index, although
volatile, is up by 50 per cent since the beginning of the year. Nairobi
stock brokers believe Firestone's issue will be of interest to overseas
investors wishing to obtain a toe-hold in one of Africa's emerging markets.

standards

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Companies listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange will be forced to meet more
stringent disclosure requirements from tomorrow with the introduction of
sweeping reforms aimed at increasing transparency and internationalising
standards in the colony.
The changes, which embrace China companies listed in Hong Kong, will require
directors to disclose their fees, perks, pension scheme contributions,
bonuses and any golden handshakes or pay-offs, and force directors and
senior managers to detail their relationships with one another.
Mr Herbert Hui, executive director and head of listing, said: 'The changes
will increase the transparency of listed companies and will bring accounts
disclosures to a level compatible with Hong Kong's position as a major
international financial centre.'
Companies will be obliged to provide details of the principal pension
schemes, including the charge to the profit and loss account for
contributions, and to furnish shareholders with revaluations of properties
and other tangible assets. Investment properties and certain properties held
by property companies may be exempted from the latter requirement.
Major customers and suppliers will also have to be listed, and the exchange
is making an attempt to increase companies' low levels of analysis.
A discussion of the results for the year is to be included in the annual
accounts and a new guidance note is being brought in for comment on
liquidity, financial resources, investments, potential acquisitions and
disposals, and elaboration of segment information given in the directors'
report.
Mr Hui has also written to all listed companies urging them to circulate
their results to as many newspapers as early as possible 'to ensure a wider
press coverage for the listed companies' financial information which the
public should know'.

FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: Pasminco calls off Korea Zinc
joint venture
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pasminco, the Australian zinc producer, has called off its proposed joint
venture agreement with Korea Zinc, the zinc smelting group, over the Elura
zinc-lead mine near Cobar, in New South Wales.
The proposed deal, announced in March, envisaged that Korea Zinc would pay
around ADollars 40m (USDollars 29.4m) for a 40 per cent interest in the mine
 -ADollars 27m up front, and the remainder when the mine was upgraded.
Pasminco would then have taken about 60 per cent of the output to supply its
Australian smelters.
Yesterday, however, Pasminco said that the subsequent due diligence process
had thrown up 'a number of commercial issues with implications for the
purchase price'.
'The parties were unable to resolve these issues and they have agreed not to
proceed with the . . . joint venture,' it added.

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The State Bank of New South Wales, the fifth largest bank in Australia, is
to be sold to Colonial Mutual, the Melbourne-based insurance group, for
ADollars 576.5m (USDollars 426.75m).
The sale was formally announced yesterday by the New South Wales government,
which first released plans to privatise the bank by way of a trade sale last
year.
The identity of the buyer, however, comes as no surprise as all the
potential bidders withdrew except Colonial Mutual.
When the sale process was initiated last November, NSW Treasury estimates
put the price at between ADollars 400m and ADollars 700m, although some
analysts suggested figures closer to ADollars 1bn.
Yesterday, the NSW Treasury denied that it had received a fire-sale price
for the bank, saying that the sum 'reflects the future prospects of the
bank'.
It also said that Colonial Mutual had undertaken to make a capital injection
of ADollars 350m into the bank at the end of four years.
The deal also includes a restriction that the bank cannot be sold to any of
Australia's four big banking groups within three years. In addition, it is
required that the bank's headquarters remain in Sydney for at least five
years, while the number of branches - currently 293 - cannot fall below 260
for three years.
Colonial Mutual must pay ADollars 526.5m by January, with the remainder due
over a three-year period.
Shortly after the sale was announced, Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating
agency, placed its AA- claims paying rating of Colonial Mutual on
creditwatch, with negative implications. It said that the acquisition was
not expected to substantially weaken the insurer's financial profile, but
that the creditwatch reflected the fact that funding and ownership structure
had yet to be finalised.
S&amp;P affirmed SBNSW's ratings, on the basis of the new state guarantee
covering all funding liabilities and associated off-balance sheet
liabilities for not less than three years.

AlliedSignal, the US automotive components and aerospace multinational, is
to challenge Robert Bosch, Champion, Japan's NGK and other rivals in the
European market for vehicle spark plugs.
It has reached an agreement in principle to acquire, for an undisclosed sum,
Ford's only remaining spark plug manufacturing operations worldwide, at
Treforest in Wales.
Initially the plant, which employs 330 people, will continue to be the
source of Ford's only spark plug supplies in Europe. However, it will
quickly seek other European customers, Mr Ralph Reins, president of
AlliedSignal Automotive, said yesterday.
AlliedSignal, whose automotive operations include Bendix braking systems and
Garrett, is already the sole supplier of spark plugs to Ford in North
America.

Shareholders in Blockbuster Entertainment, the US video rental group,
yesterday narrowly voted to merge with Viacom, the entertainment group, a
deal which appeared to be on the rocks only weeks ago.
The deal was approved by holders of 57.7 per cent of Blockbuster's shares.
An agreement, valuing the company at Dollars 7.5bn at yesterday's market
price, was an important element in Viacom's financial strategy after it bid
Dollars 10bn for Paramount. Blockbuster's strong cashflow was to be used by
Viacom to help service the substantial debt taken on with the acquisition.
The deal was thrown into doubt, however, by a steep fall in Viacom's share
price earlier this year. The non-voting B shares tumbled from Dollars 45 at
the start of the year to Dollars 21 3/4 , eroding the value of the all-share
transaction for Blockbuster's shareholders.

Toshiba of Japan, a leading manufacturer of notebook personal computers, has
licensed microprocessor chip technology from International Business Machines
in a breakthrough agreement in IBM's efforts to establish its PowerPC chip
as a new standard for the personal computer industry.
Under the agreement, Toshiba will purchase PowerPC chips from IBM for use in
future products. It also gains rights to develop derivative PowerPC chips
and to manufacture these chips for use in its own products.
The agreement is also understood to include 'very significant' monitory
elements. Toshiba has also licensed IBM's AIX computer operating system
software.
'Toshiba and IBM consider this PowerPC alliance an important strategic step
toward next-generation computer development,' said Mr Kunika Mizushima,
executive vice-president of Toshiba.
Intel, the world's largest chip maker, dominates the market for
microprocessors used in PCs. About 90 per cent of all PCs sold contain
either Intel microprocessors or chips designed to emulate Intel's
technology.
IBM, together with Motorola and Apple Computer, are, however, attempting to
establish their jointly-developed PowerPC chips as a new industry standard.
Apple introduced its first PowerPC products earlier this year. IBM said
recently it had delayed introduction of PowerPC PCs until next year,
although the company already sells work-stations and multiprocessor
computers based on PowerPC chips.
Toshiba is the first of the world's leading PC manufacturers outside the
original PowerPC alliance to adopt PowerPC for use in future products,
making it a valuable ally for IBM.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Guber is stepping down as chairman of Sony Pictures, the
Hollywood-based movie studio owned by the giant Japanese electronics group.
Although Mr Guber will retain ties with Sony through a new, unspecified,
entertainment venture which the Japanese company will help finance, his
departure is almost certainly linked to the poor recent performance of films
produced by Sony's two main units, Columbia Pictures and TriStar Pictures.
Under Mr Guber - renowned in Hollywood for spending vast sums of money on
the studio and big-budget films - Sony in 1993 lost money on its US movie
business for the first time in four years.
Expensive box-office flops, such as the Arnold Schwarzenegger action movie
Last Action Hero, were to blame. The studio has fared little better this
year, registering several big disappointments such as City Slickers 2 and
the Jack Nicholson werewolf film Wolf. By the start of this month, Sony
Pictures' share of the US box office had dropped to 11 per cent from 17.5
per cent in 1993.
Mr Guber's resignation will come as no surprise to Hollywood insiders.
Speculation that he would lose his job because of Sony Pictures' poor recent
track record began to build late last month, when Sony appointed Mr Jeff
Sagansky, the former head of programming at the CBS television network, as
head of its US film, music and electronic publishing divisions. Mr Sagansky
was instrumental in reviving the fortunes of CBS's prime-time programming
during the early 1990s, and he ran TriStar Pictures before moving to the
network in 1989.
Yet, in spite of his Hollywood experience, Mr Sagansky is not stepping into
Mr Guber's shoes. Sony said yesterday Mr Alan Levine, Sony Pictures'
president and chief operating officer, would run the studio.

Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation has taken its first step into home
shopping through a 50-50 joint venture with Warnaco, a US manufacturer of
up-market underwear. Warnaco products will be marketed in Asia through Mr
Murdoch's Star television network.
Mr Murdoch said the venture would start by transmitting advertisements and
short programmes in Mandarin and Hindi. 'We have a dozen channels in Asia at
present, and a lot of unsold advertising time,' he said. 'We'll experiment
with five-minute shows, two-minute shows and one-minute commercials.'
The venture is also the first foray into home shopping by Warnaco, a
fast-growing manufacturer of men's and women's underwear, shirts, sweaters
and ties under such brand names as Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein and Fruit of
the Loom. Sales last year were Dollars 625m.
Mr Murdoch and Mrs Linda Wachner, head of Warnaco, said they were looking at
further joint ventures in Europe, Mexico and Latin America. Mrs Wachner
said: 'We need to look at how successful we are in Asia before going
further.'

to challenge Robert Bosch, Champion, Japan's NGK and other rivals in the
European market for vehicle spark plugs.
It has reached an agreement in principle under which it will acquire, for an
undisclosed sum, Ford's only remaining spark plug manufacturing operations
worldwide, at Treforest in Wales.
Initially the plant, which employs 330 people, will continue to be the
source of Ford's only spark plug supplies in Europe. However, it will
quickly seek other European customers, Mr Ralph Reins, president of
AlliedSignal Automotive, said yesterday.
AlliedSignal, which employs more than 100,000 people worldwide and whose
automotive operations include Bendix braking systems, Garrett and other
motor component names, is already the sole supplier of spark plugs to Ford
in North America, where it manufactures around 250m plugs annually.
The Treforest facility makes 30m spark plugs a year, used by Ford as
original equipment and sold in the after-market under the Motocraft brand
name. However, such production volume is regarded by Ford as uneconomic in a
European markets which absorbs about 1bn spark plugs a year. In common with
the 'outsourcing' policies of other car makers, it is steadily disposing of
what it regards as non-core manufacturing activities.
The agreement should be finalised in time for the Treforest facility to
become part of AlliedSignal's filters and spark plugs division on January 1.
The division employs 3,800 and had sales of over Dollars 400m in 1993. The
plugs will use Motocraft and Autolite brand names.
AlliedSignal already has almost 1,600 employees in the UK, based mainly in
Carlisle and Skelmersdale, manufacturing seat belt systems and
turbochargers.

alliance

Toshiba of Japan and the US's International Business Machines yesterday
raised the stakes in the so-called 'microprocessor wars' by announcing an
alliance through which Toshiba will adopt IBM technology for some of its key
computer products.
The companies said Toshiba would license IBM's PowerPC microprocessor design
and the AIX operating system. The microprocessor is the heart of a modern
computer system, determining the power of the computer and the kind of
software it can use.
A fierce struggle is raging between semiconductor manufacturers anxious to
establish their microprocessors as the industry standard, and so reap the
lion's share of royalties from computer manufacturers.
Intel of the US is the undisputed leader. Its microprocessors are used in
about 90 per cent of the world's personal computers. PowerPC, however, is a
new kind of microprocessor known as 'risc', which offers significantly
higher performance. Developed by IBM in conjunction with Apple Computer and
Motorola, both of the US, it is being used by companies including Canon,
Groupe Bull, Hitachi, Tadpole Technology and Thomson-CSF.
The chances of a company establishing its microprocessor as the standard
increase with the number of licensees. Toshiba, which has a commanding
position in portable computers worldwide, is a valuable ally for IBM.
Mr Patrick Toole, an IBM vice-president, said: 'This announcement
strengthens and extends our alliance with Toshiba while helping establish
market acceptance of the PowerPC as the industry-leading risc
microprocessor.' The two companies are already working together on advanced
liquid crystal displays and semiconductor technologies.
Competitors for IBM's PowerPC include Digital Equipment with the Alpha chip,
Sun Microsystems with the Sparc chip, and Intel which is working with
Hewlett-Packard.

FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: Digesting the bad news at
Alcatel - A look at why the French group's shares have weakened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Alcatel Alsthom, one of France's largest industrial groups, yesterday
was the darkest day in a harrowing year. The telecoms, transport and
engineering group watched almost 14 per cent of its market capitalisation
disappear in a sell-off on the Paris bourse.
The immediate cause of the rout was a warning late on Wednesday that profits
for the year would fall much more sharply than the 10 to 20 per cent decline
forecast in January. Mr Pierre Suard, chairman, predicted a net result of
about FFr4bn (Dollars 758m) this year, some 40 per cent below the FFr7.06bn
recorded in 1993.
Alcatel said a fall in the share price was to be expected following its
profits forecast. But it said the decline was excessive, and emphasised that
the company remained one of France's most profitable business groups.
For some observers, however, the scale of the sell-off reflected a
succession of setbacks which had surprised investors and raised questions
about the group's prospects.
As well as the profits warnings - the first since 1987 when rapid expansion
elevated the company to the ranks of the country's most profitable
industrial groups - investors have also been unsettled by a legal case
involving Mr Suard. In July, the Alcatel chairman was placed under
investigation by a prosecuting magistrate in Versailles, accused of
irregularities relating to payments at his Paris properties. He strongly
rejected the allegations.
'There have been a number of incidents which have worried investors. But
Wednesday's announcement was the really nasty surprise,' said one
telecommunications analyst at a Paris merchant bank. 'It raises some
important questions,' he said.
Among the most important are why has this year's performance deteriorated so
sharply? More broadly, does the decline reflect deeper problems at the group
and in the international telecoms equipment industry?
For Mr Suard, the questions are a cause for concern, but not alarm.
Announcing his forecast on Wednesday, he described 1994 as a difficult year,
blighted by specific problems. But he said it would mark 'the low point in
the group's fortunes', and that next year would bring improved results.
The specific problems referred to concern the company's telecoms operations.
Its engineering activities, which include the construction of power stations
and manufacture of the high-speed Train a Grande Vitesse with its UK partner
GEC, performed largely in line with expectations and with last year's
results. In telecoms, however, the group was badly derailed.
In Brazil and Turkey, government austerity programmes and a consequent
tightening of budgets for telecommunications equipment prompted a fall in
sales and the freezing of contracts. The effect will be exceptional losses
of about FFr300m in each country this year.
The biggest problem, however, is Germany. The decline in investment in
eastern Germany, and the shift by Deutsche Telekom, the state telecoms
operator, to increase competition for supply contracts, are blamed for a
sharp fall in demand and prices. For the full year, Mr Suard expects
revenues at SEL, Alcatel's German subsidiary, to decline by about 20 per
cent. Losses relating to the operation are expected to total about Ecu200m
(Dollars 161.8m) for the year.
Alcatel had warned of its German difficulties in January, but resolving the
problems proved harder than expected. One reason, according to Alcatel, was
that the necessary restructuring measures at the company's German plants had
been delayed by the system of co-management with workers.
Cost-cutting measures are now under way. By the end of next year, the
company will have reduced by about 20 per cent its 20,000-strong workforce,
says Mr Suard.
For some observers, however, this provides limited reassurance. 'The most
worrying aspect is that the scale of the problems in Germany was lost on the
management,' said one analyst.
Another concern is that developments in Germany reflect a deeper structural
challenge for Alcatel. Deutsche Telekom's shift to a more open system for
awarding supply contracts shows the pressures confronting many international
telecoms operators in an increasingly competitive sector. With the
liberalisation of the European telecoms market, scheduled for 1998, and with
several large operators, including Deutsche Telekom, heading for
privatisation, the pressure to reduce costs and prices paid to suppliers is
sure to increase.
Mr Suard accepts the trend is under way. He draws a parallel with the
deregulation of the airline industry in the US, which prompted a period of
turbulence and fierce competition. However, he believes that much of the
fall in prices facing equipment suppliers has already happened. More
important, he claims, is that Alcatel's problems are outweighed by its
strength in new technology and new markets.
He mentions the company's success in winning more than 40 per cent of the
contracts to supply fibre optic networks for Germany. In the US, Alcatel
Network Systems has become the biggest supplier of SDH digital transmission
systems, and has established a strong position in broadband telecoms
switching equipment.
As well as the new technology, which will play a central role in the
development of multimedia and information superhighways, the company has
continued its aggressive expansion into international markets. In China, for
example, a stream of contracts from central and regional governments this
year has reinforced Alcatel's position as the dominant player in the world's
fastest-growing telecoms market.
The problem for Alcatel, however, is that demand for multimedia equipment
will take time to become a substantial profit centre. In its markets such as
China, competition is intensifying. 'The group has some attractive
prospects. But the problems they face are more immediate,' says one analyst.
Closer to home, there is another important contract on the horizon. The
French government is set to announce the winner in the fiercely contested
competition for France's third mobile telephones licence. With the country's
mobile phone market now rapidly, if belatedly, expanding, the licence is
regarded as a lucrative source of business by the three contenders: Alcatel,
Lyonnaise des Eaux, the utilities group, and Bouygues, the construction
group.
A victory for Alcatel would provide a badly needed boost after all the bad
news. However, after the shocks of the past nine months, it will take more
to assuage investors' concerns.

an initial Dollars 20m in a car assembly plant at Varna on the Black Sea.
Rover Bulgaria has taken a 51 per cent stake in the joint venture with the
Bulgarian private company, which is the official BMW distributor and also
holds equity stakes in several other private Bulgarian companies, including
the bank for agricultural credit and the Vitosha insurance company.
The new joint venture will initially assemble up to 10,000 Maestro models
annually from completely knocked down kits shipped from Rover's plant at

FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: Credito Italiano shares hit by
fund-raising plans
</HEADLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Credito Italiano, the recently privatised Italian bank, fell
nearly 5 per cent yesterday after it announced plans to issue new shares and
warrants to raise up to L1,520bn (Dollars 975.6m) for acquisitions.
The decision to raise more capital - announced late on Wednesday - comes
four months after Banca Commerciale Italiana, also privatised earlier this
year, decided to raise L1,575bn with a similar discounted share issue.
The BCI issue was fully subscribed when it closed last week, but investors
in both cases have demonstrated their disappointment that the banks want to
raise capital so soon after privatisation.
Credito Italiano's issue will be priced at L1,500 a share, compared with
Wednesday's closing price of L2,246. Yesterday the shares fell to L2,140.
BCI shares also slipped yesterday, from L4,081 to L3,950, as the market
absorbed news that Consob, Italy's stock exchange watchdog, would not call
for a formal bid to be launched by corporate investors who bought stakes in
the two banks after privatisation.
Critics of the sell-off claimed that allies of Mediobanca, the Milan
merchant bank, had taken effective control of Credito Italiano and BCI.
However, Consob said on Wednesday there was not enough evidence of a secret
pact between the company's large shareholders to prompt an obligatory bid.
Credito Italiano also announced a fall in the parent company's net profits,
to L83.5bn for the first half of 1994 from L133.5bn in the same period last
year, after incurring paper losses on its share and bond portfolio.
Financial operations reported a loss of L215bn in the first half, compared
with a profit of L176bn in the first half of 1993.
As well as the issue of new shares and warrants - on the basis of two new
shares for every five held - Credito Italiano is to issue one new bond with
warrants attached for every five shares held, raising a further L1,120bn.
Separately, Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, the state-controlled Italian bank,
has announced a rise in parent company net profits to L40bn from L27bn in
the first half of 1994, although the poor banking climate meant pre-tax
profits were lower than in the equivalent period.
The first-half results of Banca di Roma, another of Italy's biggest banks,
have also been affected by difficult trading. Gross operating profit fell 20
per cent to L788bn, after write-offs and provisions of L571bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Paribas, one of the leading French banking groups, yesterday reported group
profits up 13 per cent to FFr1.27bn (Dollars 241m) in the first half of
1994.
The rise stood in sharp contrast to the difficulties experienced by some of
its competitors. Paribas was also able to announce provisions down 9 per
cent to FFr4.32bn, compared with the first half of last year.
However, there was a 64 per cent growth in provisions for Credit du Nord,
the group's wholly-owned subsidiary, which reported first-half losses of
FFr191m. That compared with losses of FFr460m in the first half of 1993.
Paribas said the results reflected a notable reduction in market-related
activities, offset by growth in commercial banking activities and a
reduction in provisions.
Mr Michel Francois Poncet, chairman of the supervisory board, said: 'We will
continue to navigate in a changing and difficult market.'
Global revenues rose 1.4 per cent to FFr17.49bn, with operating profits down
3.9 per cent to FFr7.49bn in the first half of the year. Depreciation
charges rose 5.8 per cent to FFr10bn.
Mr Andre Levy Lang, director of the group's management board, said: 'Our aim
is to be an international group with a French base. These results are a step
in the right direction.'
Loans to clients dropped 4.8 per cent to FFr395bn and deposits rose 1.9 per
cent to FFr210bn, with the balance sheet total jumping 1.1 per cent to
FFr1,371bn.

FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: Blockbuster cleared for Viacom
merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders in Blockbuster, the US video retailing group, yesterday
narrowly voted to merge with Viacom, the entertainment group. The vote
ushers through a deal which appeared to be on the rocks only a matter of
weeks ago.
The deal was approved by holders of 57.7 per cent of Blockbuster's shares.
An agreement, valuing the company at Dollars 7.6bn at yesterday's market
price, was an important element in Viacom's financial strategy after it bid
Dollars 10bn for Paramount. Blockbuster's strong cashflow was to be used by
Viacom to help service the substantial debt taken on to acquire the US
entertainment group.
The deal was thrown into doubt, however, by a steep fall in Viacom's share
price earlier this year. The non-voting B shares, the main currency for the
deal, tumbled from Dollars 45 at the start of the year to Dollars 21 3/4 ,
eroding the value of the all-share transaction for Blockbuster's
shareholders and prompting several big institutions to oppose the merger.
Viacom's shares have staged a recovery in recent weeks, aided by the success
of several big Paramount movies and the rapid disposal of a number of
Paramount assets to raise cash. This, in turn, prompted optimism among
Viacom shareholders that the Blockbuster merger would be consummated, in
turn lifting Viacom's share price further. At midday yesterday, Viacom B
shares were trading at Dollars 39, up Dollars  3/8 on the day.
Despite the recovery in the shares, resistance to the transaction continued
up until the last minute. However, with 23 per cent of the shares in the
hands of the Blockbuster management and a handful of supportive
institutions, the likelihood that it would succeed had been growing in
recent weeks.
The merger agreement with Blockbuster, negotiated in January, had been due
to expire at the end of this week.

FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: UBS claims Ebner seeks control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Union Bank of Switzerland, the country's largest bank, last night said it
had strong reason to believe that a concert party was being formed to
acquire control of the bank on the cheap. That is why the bank earlier
yesterday proposed the conversion of all its registered shares into bearer
shares, thereby diluting their voting power.
UBS made clear that it believed Mr Martin Ebner's BZ banking group was
behind the effort to gain control. BK Vision, an investment company
controlled by BZ, is UBS's largest shareholder, and has built up an 18 per
cent stake in the registered shares worth about SFr1.2bn (Dollars 930m). The
UBS move would considerably dilute the voting power of this class of shares.
The registered shares have a par value of SFr20. In effect, they have five
times the voting power of SFr100 bearer shares.
Mr Ulrich Grete, UBS deputy chief executive, said officials of BK Vision had
met bank directors recently and indicated they wanted to win enough support
from shareholders to make significant alterations to the board of the
directors and orient the bank's strategy to maximise return on equity.
The bank said the registered shares were created in 1975 to prevent foreign
control of the bank. At the time, money from the Middle East was pouring
into Swiss securities. 'It is evident that the registered shares with
restricted transferability are today used by some shareholders to get an
influence on UBS's strategy which is far beyond their financial
involvement'.
It said the spread between the recent prices of the registered shares and
bearer shares had 'resulted in complaints by large private and institutional
investors'. Mr Ebner said the UBS move to dilute registered shareholders'
voting rights appeared to be a serious attack on Swiss securities law. He
was confident it would not succeed.
At yesterday's closing prices, the registered shares were at a 34 per cent
premium to the bearer shares.
BK Vision has had several skirmishes with UBS in the past two years. Last
week, the Zurich commercial court ruled in favour of a BK suit claiming that
UBS had illegally violated shareholder rights by creating pools of capital
that could be used at the board's discretion for acquisitions or convertible
bond issues.
Earlier this year, a BK motion to the UBS annual meeting proposing a cut in
board membership from 22 to a maximum of nine attracted about 40 per cent of
the votes.
A year ago, BK complained about the bank's decision to sack Mr Christoph
Blocher, a BK ally, from the board.
Two weeks ago it criticised the bank for becoming too dependent on volatile
securities trading activity for its profits.

<TEXT>
Sandvik, the Swedish engineering group, has abandoned plans to buy the
cemented carbide activities of Germany's Krupp Widia after objections from
the German cartel authorities.
Its move came after the Bundeskartellamt, the German anti-trust authority,
said Sandvik would gain too strong a position in certain products in Germany
if the acquisition went ahead. It said Sandvik's market share would be more
than 30 per cent in segments such as inserts for lathes.
Sandvik believes the authority was looking too narrowly at specific market
segments rather than at the wider market for metal cutting tools when it
reached its decision.
The purchase, which would have lifted Sandvik's turnover by SKr1.6bn a year
from its current SKr22bn (Dollars 2.8bn) was agreed in February as part of
the company's plans to develop its operations in Germany, its second biggest
market. The purchase price was not disclosed.
Sandvik said Krupp Widia would have been run independently so that
competition would not have been affected.

The financial troubles of USAir, the loss-making US airline in which British
Airways owns a 24.6 per cent stake, deepened yesterday with the announcement
that it would pass the quarterly dividend on two classes of its preference
stock.
The decision would cost BA about Dollars 25m in a full year. It would cost
Mr Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway investment group, another large
investor, about Dollars 33m.
The move sent BA shares tumbling in London yesterday with the shares losing
16p, more than 4 per cent, to close at 348p. BA shares have fallen by just
over 6 per cent during the last two days.
The announcement, which raises further concern about the financial health of
USAir, prompted fears that BA would have to carry out its threat to write
off all or part of its Dollars 400.7m investment in the troubled US carrier.
Earlier this month, it suffered its fifth fatal accident in five years with
the crash of a passenger airliner outside Pittsburgh, killing 132 people.
However, BA remains confident its partnership with USAir will this year
achieve Pounds 70m-worth (Dollars 110.6m) in gains from added revenues and
savings from its combined operations with the US carrier. BA said it had
this year received half the annual Dollars 25m in dividends due on its
preferred shares.
However, Mr Chris Avery, the London-based aviation analyst at Paribas, said
the announcement 'is more evidence of the very deep difficulties facing
USAir'. An increasing number of City analysts expect the US carrier to file
for US Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, although the airline is not facing
an immediate liquidity crisis.
The decision is seen as a signal of USAir's willingness to share sacrifices
with its unions, from which it is seeking wage concessions.
USAir's shares dropped Dollars 1 to close at Dollars 4.

FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: UAP buys Provincial Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the insurance group privatised earlier
this year, yesterday announced the purchase of Provincial Insurance in the
UK as part of its plan to develop its network across the newly-unified
European insurance market.
The move with Provincial, the privately-held group which is the UK's 15th
largest general insurance company, had long been mooted.
UAP would not disclose the purchase price of Provincial, but indicated that
it was 'notably less' than Pounds 300m (Dollars 474m).
It said the final cost would be influenced by stock-market conditions at the
time the deal is completed in November. Payment is entirely in cash.
Mr Jacques-Henri Gougenheim, general controller of UAP, who co-ordinated the
purchase agreement signed yesterday, said there were no plans to lay off
staff or to remove the highly respected Provincial name.
He said one of the reasons that UAP was attracted to Provincial was its
telephone insurance company called Prospero, one of a growing number of
companies offering motor and home insurance by telephone direct to the
public, cutting out the industry's traditional intermediary, the broker.
Provincial reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 31.8m last year.
The deal signals a possible speed-up in cross-border deals by European
insurers following the unification of the insurance market over the summer.
In June, Commercial Union, the UK's biggest insurer, bought Victoire,
France's fifth largest life insurance company, for some Pounds 1.5bn.

FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: Fiat bounces back into black in
first six months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Fiat, the Italian industrial and automotive group, yesterday said it had put
last year's heavy losses behind it, and announced a return to profit of
L727bn (Dollars 453m) before tax in the first half of 1994.
The company confirmed it was on course for a full-year net profit, bouncing
back from the record loss of L1,783bn in 1993, and that 1994 sales should
rise to L63,000bn, up 15 per cent on 1993. Fiat's share price has risen
strongly in recent weeks, and the results were in line with most analysts'
expectations.
The company said it would continue to improve efficiency and develop new
products 'with unvaried determination', but sounded a note of caution about
the depth of the recovery, particularly in the 'very weak' Italian car
market, which accounts for 40 per cent of sales made by the group's
principal subsidiary, Fiat Auto.
When it released interim figures a year ago, Fiat heralded the blackest year
in its 95-year history by announcing a pre-tax loss of L982bn, and a complex
restructuring and capital-raising exercise.
Since then, improved trading conditions in most of Europe outside Italy, the
successful launch of the group's new small car, the Fiat Punto, and pressure
to reduce costs has helped to reverse the group's sudden slump into the red.
In the first half, Fiat's net consolidated sales rose to L31,363bn from
L27,153bn, restated to account for the sale of La Rinascente, the retailer,
last year.
As a proportion of turnover, the group has managed to cut overheads from
16.4 per cent in the first half of last year, to 13.6 per cent in the first
six months of 1994. Net debt has been reduced to L3,447bn - 15 per cent of
net equity - compared with L6,983bn on June 30, 1993, and L5,247bn at the
end of last year.
Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, director-general of the group, said: 'We're obviously
satisfied by the results we have achieved, both because the speed of the
recovery is good, and because it's better than our long-term forecasts.'
Mr Garuzzo warned that the market, particularly in the automotive sector,
had still not entirely emerged from recession. In the first half, car
deliveries in Europe rose an average of 6.6 per cent, while figures from
Italian automotive associations indicate that deliveries of all makes in
Italy have slipped by an average of 2.6 per cent.

FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: Finmeccanica cuts first-half
loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Finmeccanica, Italy's state-controlled engineering group, managed to cut its
first half loss to L146bn (Dollars 59.32m) from L160bn, but warned yesterday
that the second half would be 'demanding'.
The company said it had not felt the full impact of gradual economic
recovery because it operated in sectors like space and defence, which depend
on large public investment projects, although it added that certain
subsidiaries - such as the automation operations - had reported much better
results.
Overall turnover grew to L4,827bn from L4,696bn in the equivalent period,
and the operating profit nearly doubled to L110bn from L57bn. The company
attributed the increase to the benefits of continuing rationalisation.
Net debt fell to L5,882bn at June 30, compared with L6,311bn a year earlier,
and financial charges were cut to L152bn (L190bn).
Parmalat, the Italian dairy products group, increased consolidated pre-tax
profits in the first half of this year to L75bn, from L55bn in the first six
months of 1993.

FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais goes to the
people
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Credit Lyonnais, the embattled French banking group, is pleading directly
with its customers and staff in an effort win back their support after
months of negative publicity.
The bank, which reported losses of FFr4.5bn (Dollars 850m) earlier this
week, yesterday launched a strongly-worded campaign with advertisements in
all 66 regional French papers and most of the national press.
The full-page advertisements describe the company's position and prospects
at length, with the first one headlined: 'Here are the bad results that
everyone has been waiting for'. A further four will follow over the next few
days.
In an even more unusual move, Credit Lyonnais's final advert next Tuesday
will announce operation 'open-door evening' next month, when its 2,200
French branches will open until 9pm to answer questions about its financial
state from anxious customers.
Asked whether it could justify spending the FFr15m-FFr20m that the campaign
is costing on top of the large losses, it said: 'People had been hearing
about Credit Lyonnais for some months. We felt it was necessary to do
something rather strong rather than keeping silent.'
The bank admitted that the campaign was focused as much on its own 38,000
embattled employees as on the roughly 6m account holders with the bank. They
have been questioning their commitment to the bank after the FFr6.9bn losses
reported in March and a scathing parliamentary inquiry published over the
summer.
'Demoralisation would not be a good word, but it is clear that there has
been pressure on the network since March which is hard for everyone,' it
said. However, the bank claimed that it had not experienced any loss of
depositors since news of its troubles began to emerge.
'The message is that we don't want clients to forget that we are
professionals, that we have nothing to hide and that there are many things
we can still be proud of,' the bank said.

FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: Sandvik abandons German deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sandvik, the Swedish engineering group, has abandoned plans to buy the
cemented carbide activities of Germany's Krupp Widia after objections from
the German cartel authorities.
Its move came after the Bundeskartellamt, the German anti-trust authority,
said Sandvik would gain too strong a position in certain products in Germany
if the acquisition went ahead. It said Sandvik's market share would be more
than 30 per cent in segments such as inserts for lathes.
Sandvik believes the authority was looking too narrowly at specific market
segments rather than at the wider market for metal cutting tools when it
reached its decision.
The purchase, which would have lifted Sandvik's turnover by SKr1.6bn a year
from its current SKr22bn (Dollars 2.8bn) was agreed in February as part of
the company's plans to develop its operations in Germany, its second biggest
market. The purchase price was not disclosed.
Sandvik said Krupp Widia would have been run independently so that
competition would not have been affected. There would have been scope for
technology exchange and common purchase of raw materials, it noted.
Mr Clas Ake Hedstrom, Sandvik chief executive, said: 'We are convinced the
transaction would have provided benefits for several parties, particularly
Widia and the German engineering industry.'
Sandvik stressed that its broader expansion plans had not been derailed.

FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: UBS acts to curb Ebner's voting
power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Union Bank of Switzerland, the country's largest bank, is proposing to
convert all its registered shares into bearer shares in a thinly disguised
attack on Mr Martin Ebner's BZ banking group.
BK Vision, an investment company controlled by BZ, is UBS's largest
shareholder, and has built up an 18 per cent stake in the registered shares
worth about SFr1.2bn (Dollars 930m). The UBS move will considerably dilute
the voting power of this class of shares.
The registered shares have a par value of SFr20, thus giving an investment
in them five times the voting power of the same investment in the SFr100
bearer shares. The bank said its move was to prevent single holders of
registered shares, representing a minority of the share capital, from
getting 'excessive influence'.
UBS is proposing to reduce both classes of shares to a common SFr10 par
value, thereby equalising their voting power, and to eliminate restrictions
on foreigners voting.
The bank said the registered shares were created in 1975 to prevent foreign
control of the bank. It said the spread between the recent prices of the
registered shares and bearer shares had 'resulted in complaints by large
private and institutional investors'.
Mr Ebner said yesterday that the UBS move to dilute registered shareholders'
voting rights appeared to be a serious attack on Swiss securities law. He
was confident it would not succeed.
At yesterday's closing prices, the registered were at a 34 per cent premium
to the bearers.
BK Vision has had several skirmishes with UBS. Last week, the Zurich
commercial court ruled in favour of BK's claim that UBS had illegally
violated shareholder rights by creating pools of capital that could be used
at the board's discretion for acquisitions or convertible bond issues.

Higher interest income and an absence of credit losses enabled Nordic
Investment Bank, jointly owned by the five Nordic countries, to double
profits in the first eight months to Ecu66m (Dollars 81.84m) from Ecu32m,
writes Christopher Brown-Humes.
The Helsinki-based bank said the outlook remained positive, and it expected
full-year profits to be about 50 per cent higher than last year's Ecu64m.
The bank said it did not suffer any loan losses during the period.

FT  30 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Forte leaps 62% to Pounds 60m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forte yesterday announced interim pre-tax profits ahead 62 per cent from
Pounds 37m to Pounds 60m and issued its most optimistic assessment of future
prospects in years.
Mr Rocco Forte, the hotel and restaurant group's chairman, said profits so
far in the second half were well ahead of last year.
Mr Forte warned, however, that UK consumer confidence was still fragile and
that there was little sign of a 'feelgood factor'. Much of the group's
profit improvement was the result of an increase in corporate spending.
Forte's increase in half-year profits, which were above City expectations,
comes at the end of a highly successful month.
In the past fortnight Forte has defeated its French rival Accor to win
control of Meridien, the international hotel chain owned by Air France. It
has also been granted a formal say in the management of the Savoy group, in
which it holds a majority of shares but a minority of votes.
Sales from continuing operations were up 7 per cent to Pounds 859m in the
six months to July 31. The interim dividend was 2.75p, the same as last
year, on earnings per share up 75 per cent to 4.9p. Dividend cover was 1.7,
compared with 1 a year ago.
Mr Forte said, however, it was right to maintain the dividend at the halfway
stage. He said: 'We are in a recovery situation. Our dividend cover is not
where it should be.'
Profits from the worldwide hotels business rose 47 per cent to Pounds 66m
(Pounds 45m) on sales up 8 per cent to Pounds 494m (Pounds 457m).
London hotels performed particularly strongly, with occupancies up 8
percentage points on last year. Achieved average room rates - the amount
actually paid by guests rather than the hotels' official rates - rose 6 per
cent.
Provincial hotels in the UK enjoyed a 6 point rise in occupancy, although
average achieved room rate fell 1 per cent. In continental Europe
occupancies rose 7 points but achieved room rates fell 4 per cent.
Forte's restaurants saw profits rise 13 per cent to Pounds 35m (Pounds 31m)
on sales up 3 per cent to Pounds 322m (Pounds 313m).
The number of meals served at Little Chef, Happy Eater and Welcome Break
fell slightly because of the weakness of leisure spending, the hot summer
and disruption from roadworks. Average amounts spent rose, however.
Improvements to the Relais restaurant chain in France resulted in an
increase in profits despite a fall in traffic on French autoroutes.

FT  30 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Cowie expands bus fleet with Pounds 30m
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cowie Group, the car leasing and motor trading company, yesterday announced
a big expansion of its bus operations with the Pounds 29.9m acquisition of
Leaside Bus Company, the subsidiary of London Regional Transport (LRT).
The deal, involving a Pounds 25.5m cash payment and Pounds 4.4m to settle
intra-group loans, will enlarge Cowie's bus fleet from 128 vehicles to more
than 600 and is expected to lead to a fourfold sales increase.
'We paid slightly more than we wanted to, but it was worth it for the
enormous growth that it promises,' said Mr Gordon Hodgson, chief executive.
The acquisition follows four months of talks between LRT and Cowie, which
has been seeking a larger stake in the London bus network for more than two
years.
At present, the group's bus and coach operations are dominated by Grey-Green
 -acquired 14 years ago - which serves 13 bus routes in London and employs
450 drivers. Leaside, by comparison, has a workforce of about 1,800 and
operates 28 routes.
Mr Hodgson, who is meeting Leaside managers today, said he was determined to
introduce private sector efficiency to the business, which last year made
profits of just Pounds 607,000 on turnover of Pounds 43m. In the same
period, Grey-Green made profits of Pounds 1.6m on sales of Pounds 14.4m.
Cowie shares fell 3 1/2 p to 218 1/2 p yesterday - a new low for the year.

FT  30 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Sherwood cuts losses to Pounds 88,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sherwood Computer Services made a loss of Pounds 88,000 in the first half of
the year after redundancy costs of Pounds 412,000 and a contribution of
Pounds 300,000 from an investment which has now been disposed of.
The results were in line with the board's and market expectations. The share
price was down 4p at 101p.
The company made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 541,000 for the same period in
1993 but was Pounds 2m in the red at the year-end. It has restructured
significantly over the past year, concentrating on software and services for
the London insurance market, life assurance and pensions and investment
services. With the sale of Consort Data, it has withdrawn from the
investment management software market.
Turnover was Pounds 11.9m compared with Pounds 11.8m in the first half last
year. Net debt has been reduced to Pounds 1.9m compared with Pounds 3.4m at
December 31. Fully diluted earnings per share came in at 1.5p compared with
3.4p. The dividend is passed (1.75p).
Mr David O'Brien, chairman, said results from the life and pensions venture
Sherwood International had been disappointing as many companies had yet to
decide on their future systems. City Deal Services, however, offering an
execution only stockbroking service, had 40,000 customers and was proving
successful.
He said the restructuring was complete and the directors were confident of
further recovery, adding that Sherwood would be dependent on increased sales
towards the end of the year to meet its targets.

A fall in operating costs helped Pochin's, the building and civil

FT  30 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Helical Bar jumps to Pounds 4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rents from properties acquired during 1993 enabled Helical Bar, the property
investment and development company, to increase pre-tax profits from Pounds
2.22m to Pounds 4.02m in the half year to July 31.
Turnover advanced to Pounds 21.6m (Pounds 10.9m), with most of the increase
coming from acquisitions. Mr Michael Slade, managing director, said Helical
had bought little investment property during the period and had been
concentrating on development projects.
Administrative expenses increased to Pounds 1.24m (Pounds 943,000) and net
interest costs were Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 2.6m), including Pounds 590,000 of
interest capitalised on development projects.
After tax of Pounds 835,000, earnings per share were 10.83p (10.89p) basic
and 10.93p fully diluted. The interim dividend is increased from 2.5p to
2.75p.
During the first half Helical put in place Pounds 100m of new banking
facilities, including an Pounds 85m 10-year borrowing facility. Since July,
the company has agreed a further Pounds 20m seven-year facility at a fixed
interest rate of 8.625 per cent.
Mr Slade said Helical now had Pounds 21m of cash and Pounds 45m undrawn
banking facilities at its disposal to fund acquisitions of investment
property and developments.
The company has agreed funding with investment institutions for five office
and industrial developments, which should have a value of about Pounds 35m
on completion.
A further three developments are planned, at Camberley in Surrey, Edinburgh
and the City of London. Institutional funding for these schemes is being
sought.
Earlier this week Helical formed a joint venture with former employees of
retail group Sears.

FT  30 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Hopkinsons in red but interim held
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopkinsons Group, the industrial abrasives and engineering concern,
yesterday reported a first half pre-tax loss of Pounds 749,000, but is
maintaining its interim dividend of 0.5p per share.
The loss for the six months to July 31 compared with profits of Pounds
722,000 a year earlier and reflected exceptional items of Pounds 1.36m.
Reorganisation of the bonded abrasives business produced a Pounds 1.5m
charge, offset partly by a profit on the disposal of the drinks equipment
business.
Before exceptional items, pre-tax profits fell by 15 per cent to Pounds
611,000. Operating profit overall declined by 9 per cent to Pounds 1.02m
(Pounds 1.12m), but rose 37 per cent to Pounds 697,000 for continuing
operations.
Sales rose from Pounds 51.7m to Pounds 53.8m.
Mr Bill Goodall, chairman, said progress had been made in implementing the
company's strategic review. The sale of the drinks equipment subsidiary had
realised cash proceeds of Pounds 5.1m and the reorganisation of the
abrasives operations in Germany and the UK would be 'well on the way to
completion' by the end of the year.
After a tax credit of Pounds 401,000, there was a net loss of Pounds 348,000
(profit of Pounds 722,000). Losses per share were 0.45p (earnings of 0.91p).
On the outlook for abrasives, Hopkinsons said the German market was showing
signs of recovery, albeit somewhat unevenly, while the UK market was
improving steadily.
In the Bryan Donkin engineering business, South America and the Far East
offered good prospects for growth in sales of gas controls and machinery.

FT  30 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Bus market recovery helps Trinity rise 32%
to Pounds 6.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong recovery in the UK bus market and firm demand from overseas
operators helped Trinity Holdings, the specialist vehicle manufacturer, to
increase first half pre-tax profits by 32 per cent to Pounds 6.25m (Pounds
4.76m).
The company said UK bus registrations, which have increased by 15 per cent
in each of the last two years, rose more sharply in the first six months and
were currently 25 per cent ahead of last year.
Trinity, which has 40 per cent of the new bus market, was helped by Pounds
33m of orders from Badgerline and Stagecoach.
Mr Geoff Hollyhead, chairman, said the average age of buses in the UK was 14
years, against nine years before the deregulation of the industry.
Consequently there was plenty of scope for growth as operators renewed their
fleets.
Mr Hollyhead added that with export demand also strong, the company was 'on
target to increase group output by 15 per cent this year and aim to continue
that rate for the foreseeable future.'
Significant orders had been received from the far east and forays had been
made into the African market. A Malaysian joint venture was proving
promising. Mr Hollyhead was confident that the overseas market would account
for about 40 per cent of group turnover. 'The developing countries want to
build transport systems as good as in the west, the potential for expansion
is enormous.'
Turnover in the first half, increased by 14 per cent to Pounds 71.6m (Pounds
62.7m). Earnings advanced to 8.1p (6.2p) and the dividend was 2.25p (2.0p).
Trinity's order book for buses, refuse trucks, fire engines and airport
maintenance vehicles, was up 15 per cent on the year at about Pounds 85m. Mr
Hollyhead said the planned investment to increase production capacity would
be met out of the Pounds 9m cash surplus.
COMMENT
The premium rating attached to Trinity's shares after barely two years in
the market would appear to be justified. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 7m in
1993 are likely to be nearly doubled in 1995. Earnings per share are
forecast to grow from 10.7p to 16.9p in that time - the latter representing
a p/e of 19.5. With the UK bus market recovering and overseas markets
growing strongly, the management's forecast of 15 per cent organic growth
per annum in the next few years is plausible. While this should help to
guard against any downside, the shares may find it hard to maintain
momentum.

rise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The chairman of Bracken-bridge, the USM-quoted bridal and formal wear
company has, resigned after less than six months following disagreements
over its future direction. The departure of Mr George Wardale, who took up
the post on May 23, was 'amicable', the company said.
Pre-tax losses for the year to March 31 soared from Pounds 1.57m to Pounds
6.39m. Almost Pounds 4m of the deficit was in respect of writedowns and
provisions as part of its reorganisation earlier this year. Turnover slipped
12 per cent from Pounds 16.3m to Pounds 14.3m, including Pounds 2.46m
(Pounds 3.05m). Losses per share more were 35.3p (10.1p).
Mr Simon Raynaud, the new chairman, said it was now accounting for retail
turnover on a cash received basis rather than on business booked. Net assets
had reduced substantially as a result.

FT  30 SEP 94 / UK Company News: S African leak in ConsGold bid run-up - DTI
says majority of dealings in call options were 'wholly abnormal'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leaked information from South Africa led to insider trading in options on
Consolidated Gold Fields shares ahead of the Pounds 2.9bn bid from Minorco
in 1988.
That is one of the main conclusions of the Department of Trade and Industry
report on the ownership of Consolidated Gold Fields, published yesterday.
The report, which runs to more than 600 pages before hitting lengthy
appendices, and weighs almost 2 kilogrammes, finds nothing wrong with
dealings in the shares. But it says that 'the majority of dealings in
ConsGold call options were wholly abnormal' in the run-up to the fiercely
resisted bid from Minorco, 60 per cent owned by Mr Harry Oppenheimer's Anglo
American Corporation-De Beers group.
By September 21, 1988, when the bid was launched, 81 per cent of the
effective long position in call options was held by five investor groups.
The inspectors - Philip Heslop QC and Richard Lewis, chartered accountant -
'are in no doubt' that a leak about the bid took place in South Africa in
mid-June at the latest.
Dealings on the London traded options market followed, first from
Johannesburg, and then from London itself and elsewhere.
The five investor groups made profits of Pounds 11m on an initial outlay of
about Pounds 5.5m. By far the biggest group, with 56 per cent of the call
options in question, is known in the report as The Foundations.
This group operated via a Liechtenstein bank which placed its business
through Savory Milln, a subsidiary of Swiss Bank Corporation - the lead
financier to Minorco's bid. It made Pounds 4.26m from the options dealings,
which were described by one expert as 'kamikaze trading.'
After inquiries which ranged round the world, including offshore banking
centres such as the Cayman and Channel Islands, the inspectors were unable
to identify the owners of The Foundations. But they are convinced that South
African interests were closely involved.
'We consider that the South African authorities are best placed and perhaps
the only people who can identify the beneficiaries of The Foundations'
traded options deals,' they conclude.
However, the report finds no evidence to suggest that the original leak was
deliberate so far as Minorco, Anglo American, De Beers or the interests of
the Oppenheimer family were concerned.
Minorco, which already owned 29.9 per cent of ConsGold ahead of the bid, is
also found not to have had any undisclosed interests in its target. Neither
was it under any obligation to make any disclosure under company law.
The inspectors assert that they have probably been able to ascertain more
about the Oppenheimer family's interests, which they describe as
historically 'shrouded in mystery,' than any previous inquiry.
While they were unable to verify the full extent of the interests, there was
no evidence of any build up in ConsGold shares between December 1987 and May
1989, nor of 'any destabilisation of ConsGold's share register which could
be attributed directly or in-directly to the Oppenheimer interests.'
The inquiry was originally prompted by ConsGold's public statement that the
possible outcome of the bid had been crucially affected by the
destabilisation of its share register, a month ahead of the bid.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whitbread, the brewing, retailing and leisure group, yesterday folded the
'Whitbread umbrella,' its 40-year-old portfolio of stocks in regional
brewers designed to protect them from takeover. The remaining shares in the
portfolio were sold to a new investment trust for Pounds 27m.
The purchase by Lazard Brewers Investment Trust, launched yesterday by
Lazard Brothers, attracted criticism, however, from some analysts. Instead
of buying the shares at a discount typical in such transactions, the trust
bought them at the market mid-price.
'Lazard is paying a very full price,' one analyst said. If Whitbread had
tried to sell the stake in each brewer in the market it would have probably
received a lower price, he added. 'A conventional placing would have got
them less.'
Mr Peter Rintoul, director of investment trusts at Lazard, said buying at
the mid-point between the bid and ask prices was appropriate.
'As a long-term investor, we viewed the package in the round. The portfolio
is well diversified by product and geography.' Moreover, some of the stocks
were not publicly traded.
If the trust had tried to buy the shares in the market, prices would have
risen, he added. The portfolio bought yesterday includes shares in HP
Bulmer, the cider maker and brewers WH Brakspear, Hardys and Hansons and
Joseph Holt.
Whitbread had sold the bulk of its regional brewing shares in March for
Pounds 225m in a 'bought deal' with BZW. The shares sold yesterday had been
omitted from that transaction because they were deemed to be harder to sell.
'The existence of the trust has been useful,' Whitbread said yesterday.
Lazard is offering 125m ordinary shares at 25p and 25m warrants in units of
five ordinary shares and one warrant at Pounds 5 a unit.
The trust will be managed by Mr Billy Whitbread, for the past five years
investment manager of Whitbread Investment Company. Subscriptions close on
October 22.
Mr Alan Perelman, Whitbread's finance director, said the sale would release
capital for organic expansion.
'We continue to have excellent trading relationships with all the companies
involved.'

FT  30 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Construction side holds back Higgs and Hill
to Pounds 0.65m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tough trading conditions in the construction market restricted Higgs and
Hill to a first-half pre-tax profit rise of just Pounds 125,000 to Pounds
650,000.
Turnover declined by 4 per cent to Pounds 120.2m (Pounds 125.5m).
Mr John Theakston, chief executive, said the company's strategy, which
involved a Pounds 22.1m rights issue last May in order to bolster its
building programme, would not benefit earnings until next year.
'We have moved from a retrenchment phase to a reinvestment phase in the
company's development which will see the benefit in the years to come,' he
said.
While the construction order book rose by Pounds 30m to Pounds 200m compared
with a year ago, margin pressure remained intense, with both subcontractor
and supplier prices rising.
However, Mr Theakston said the company would retain its construction
capacity: 'We are a three-core business and intend to remain so. We need to
have a good balance to the group's revenue stream.'
He added that any future investment in the short term would be aimed at the
property and housing businesses. These both saw a modest increase in
activity in the first half, the latter boosted by the acquisition of 15 new
sites, 10 bought from English China Clays.
The land bank increased by about 20 per cent to 2,000 plots with planning
permission.
Earnings per share advanced 28 per cent to 0.9p (0.7p). The interim dividend
is maintained at 1p.

FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: High milk prices leave Waterford
Foods lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MCMANUS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Waterford Foods, Ireland's second-largest co-operative, reported a 16 per
cent slip in interim pre-tax profits from IPounds 11.4m to IPounds 9.6m
(Pounds 9.5m) because of high Irish milk prices and pressure on prices for
cheese, Waterford's main product.
The strength of the punt, which has been near parity with sterling, also
posed problems for the group, cutting into export margins.
Operating margins fell from 5.9 to 4.3 per cent while turnover was up 7.4
per cent to IPounds 363m, with increased sales in all three operating
divisions.
However, the group says it is confident of a better performance for the full
year and has embarked on a rationalisation programme, aimed at cutting costs
by IPounds 12m, which analysts expect to result in a significant year-end
provision.
As part of the restructuring Waterford is to close its dairy plant Didsbury
and transfer production to its main plant at Hyde in Manchester with the
loss of about 100 jobs.
Turnover in dairy products, including cheese, was up 4 per cent at IPounds
171m. The consumer products division, including liquid milk and fresh
products, reported a 10 per cent rise in turnover to IPounds 145m.
Earnings per share dipped 25 per cent to 3.87p but the group is raising the
interim dividend 5 per cent to 1.25p. Waterford shares closed 5p down at
80p.
Analysts are expected to trim full-year profits forecasts from IPounds 28m
to IPounds 22m taking account of the restructuring provision.

FT  30 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Watchdog fails to join Yorshire Water board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
City institutions yesterday overturned a victory by small shareholders of
Yorkshire Water, who had overwhelmingly supported a proposal that Mrs Diana
Scott, a former consumer watchdog, should join the board of directors.
Mrs Scott, former chairman of the Ofwat Yorkshire Region Customer Service
Committee, contended that she had relevant experience to deal with the
strident environmental and customer complaints expressed at yesterday's
annual meeting.
She won support from a big majority of individual shareholders on a show of
hands at a raucous meeting in Pudsey, West Yorkshire, attended by about 600
people.
However Sir Gordon Jones, Yorkshire Water's chairman, called for a poll, and
institutions swung the vote, supporting the management decision to block Mrs
Scott by a ratio of nearly 4:1. The votes cast against her election
represented 62.3m shares versus 16.5m in favour.
Pensions and Investment Research Consultants, a pension fund consultancy,
had backed the appointment of Mrs Scott because of concerns over Yorkshire's
environmental record and the number of customer complaints. The local
authority pension funds of North, South and West Yorkshire, as well as
Humberside, are all understood to have voted in favour of Mrs Scott.
Mr Stuart Bell, research director at PIRC, said: 'It represents a clear
moral victory. Given the overlap between shareholders and customers, this
can also be taken as a reflection of customers' views.'
Sir Gordon defended his company's record, saying: 'Yorkshire's rivers have
not been cleaner since the industrial revolution,' claiming that half of the
company's substantial investment programme was being spent on reversing
decades of government neglect.
The number of complaints had fallen by 30 per cent in period between March
and July, compared with a year earlier, although for 1993 as a whole
complaints had bucked the downward national trend by rising 12 per cent.
He also stated that a Pounds 75,000 fine, over a burst sewage pipe, had been
reduced to Pounds 15,000, which meant that Yorkshire was in the middle ranks
for fines on polluting water companies instead of at the top, as stated by
PIRC.
All the proxy cards sent to shareholders had 'not recommended by the
directors' stamped against Mrs Scott.
Sir Gordon claimed that 'if we were looking for another non-executive
director, we would want someone with international and big company
experience.' Mrs Scott's riposte was that the show of discontent had
'demonstrated how important it is to have someone on the board with my
expierience'.

FT  30 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Flextech Pounds 9m in loss after 'eventful'
half year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Flextech, the new media group which has expanded rapidly as a provider and
manager of cable and satellite television channels, announced a pre-tax loss
of Pounds 9m for the six months to June 30.
Turnover at the USM-quoted former oil services company amounted to Pounds
7m. The Pounds 9m loss - including start-up costs of new satellite channels
 -compares with a Pounds 3.2m deficit, although since then the company has
changed beyond recognition.
The main developments have included:
A majority stake has been taken by TCI of Denver, the largest US cable
operator.
The programming assets of United Artists European Holdings, a subsidiary of
TCI, have been integrated with Flextech's.
A 20 per cent stake has been bought in HTV, the ITV company for Wales and
the west of England.
Flextech has a 30 per cent stake in the Dow Jones plan to launch The
European Business Channel early next year.
With a touch of understatement, Mr Stanislas Yassukovich, chairman, said
that the first half of 1994 had continued to be eventful.
The company said yesterday that when The Learning Channel joined the Sky
Multi-Channels package on October 1 Flextech would contribute 'eight out of
16 channels marketed as the Sky Multi-Channels Package'.
Losses per share amounted to 11.81p (6.68p). The retained loss totalled
Pounds 9.6m.

FT  30 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Ruberoid up 3% to Pounds 2.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ruberoid, the roofing company spun off by Tarmac last year, yesterday
announced a 3 per cent increase in interim profits, in spite of a sluggish
UK construction market.
Mr David Watson, finance director, said the wettest spring in more than a
century had delayed the completion of many contracts. In addition the
long-awaited recovery in the UK construction market had been slow to
materialise.
Cost-cutting and lower interest charges helped produce pre-tax profits for
the six months to June 30 of Pounds 2.23m (Pounds 2.16m). Sales fell to
Pounds 108m (Pounds 114m).
Mr Watson said Ruberoid was on track to meet full-year expectations, helped
by the acquisition of a US business and the outstanding interest in a UK
joint venture.
In the first half, Ruberoid cut some Pounds 500,000 from on-going costs and
expects a further Pounds 500,000 in savings during the latter part of the
year. A Pounds 300,000 charge was taken to pay for the rationalisation.
The dividend, Ruberoid's first interim payout since flotation, was 1.8p.
Earnings were unchanged at 3.2p.

FT  30 SEP 94 / UK Company News: French Connection lifted to Pounds 3.07m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Improvements on the wholesale side and in the US and Hong Kong operations
underpinned a 53 per cent pre-tax profits increase at French Connection in
the six months to July 31.
The fashion clothing company, 75 per cent owned by Mr Stephen Marks, its
chief executive, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.07m (Pounds 2m) on
turnover up 14 per cent at Pounds 34.7m (Pounds 30.6m). Shares eased 5p to
250p.
There will again be no dividend. Mr Nicholas Mather, finance director, said
the holding company's balance sheet was still in deficit - Pounds 3.2m at
January 31 - but he hoped the group would restart payments 'sometime in
1995/96'.
UK retail sales rose to Pounds 8.7m (Pounds 8m) from four concessions and 24
shops, up three on last time. Mr Mather thought it a 'good performance
compared to some competitors', adding that it had been a 'tough summer on
the high street'. Margins were lower than last time.
Export sales to Europe, where the company had gone the wholesale rather than
the retail route, had increased. In France, sales were flat at Pounds 1.4m
but losses were reduced. In the US, sales were largely unchanged at Pounds
10.9m, but margins improved significantly.
Sales in the Far East of products sourced from Hong Kong rose to Pounds 2.6m
(Pounds 1.6m).
Gross margins for the group improved 1.4 percentage points. Mr Mather
pointed to careful risk management, especially on the buying side, and the
benefits of forward cover on currencies, especially the Hong Kong dollar.
Operating profits climbed 39 per cent to Pounds 3.2m. Earnings grew to 10.6p
(4.4p) per share.

Pre-tax profits at Garton Engineering, the components and special fasteners
maker, slipped from Pounds 197,000 to Pounds 170,000 in the first half of
1994.
The result included the gain on land surplus to requirements following the
fire in December 1990.
Turnover improved from Pounds 10.2m to Pounds 12.2m. The interim dividend is
lifted to 1.25p (1.125p), payable from earnings of 2.99p (3.41p) per share.

FT  30 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Carlton Comms in Dollars 21m sale
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Carlton Communications is selling Immix to Scitex Corporation for Dollars
21m (Pounds 13m). Immix, which supplies video editing equipment, reported
operating losses of Dollars 1.7m on sales of Dollars 7.3m in the six months
to March 31.
Immix was a start up company within Carlton's video and sound division set
up to develop the editing technology aimed at the smaller end of the market
including in house corporate videos and independent production companies.
Scitex, the Israel-based company which makes electronic pre-press systems,
approached Carlton as it wanted to get into the market. The price, which
Carlton said offered a fair profit on its investment, was thought acceptable
for a company which was considered to be on the edge of the division's
activities.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Prudent banking or blind panic?: Second-guessing
Metallgesellschaft's woes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Were Metallgesellschaft's creditor banks, led by Deutsche, struck by blind
panic when, at the turn of the year, they forced the liquidation of the
group's US oil futures positions and effectively precipitated its
near-collapse?
Is it possible, as has been suggested by professors, that the banks did not
properly understand the niceties of derivatives trading and caused far
heavier losses than necessary? Was the affair a costly, avoidable blunder?
Is it even possible that Deutsche deliberately turned paper or potential oil
futures losses into a real deficit - regardless of cost - to seize control
of Metallgesellschaft and supplant its adventurous management with its own
team?
The underlying questions in the debate over Metallgesellschaft's misfortunes
reappeared this week in a flurry which sparked a crash in the group's stock
price.
However, by last night, after falling by almost a third to around DM100, the
shares were back where they started the week at DM145.
Deutsche has stood throughout by its claim that it adhered to the first
principle of banking prudence and refused to throw good money after the bad
it had dispatched into the New York oil futures market by MG Refining &amp;
Marketing.
Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, a Deutsche director, and the power behind Mr Kajo
Neukirchen, MG chairman, rejected criticisms from the US - most notably from
Mr Merton Miller, Nobel prize winner - of misguided crisis management and
over-reaction. Mr Miller's reconstruction of events was based on false
assumptions about MG's oil futures business and factual errors.
Mr Schmitz dismissed as 'groundless' complaints, reportedly filed with
German state prosecutors by an anonymous 'committee' claiming to represent
employees of MG and people 'damaged' by Deutsche's handling of the affair,
that Deutsche Bank was responsible for driving the group to the brink of
bankruptcy - to the benefit of his own employer - and broke the law in the
process.
Perhaps the most telling factor behind the share price rebound was a
reminder from Mr Neukirchen of his promise that MG would show an operating
profit of more than DM100m (Dollars 64.9m) in the new financial year, which
starts tomorrow.
Mr Neukirchen and his all-new board have been beavering away at polishing
the group's balance sheet and profit-and-loss account for the launch into
the new year.
Among the trickier manoeuvres successfully negotiated this week, the board
managed to off-load a handful of shares in MG's loss-ridden environmental
services subsidiary, BUS Berzelius, into the hands of unnamed, but clearly
sympathetic institutional investors.
As a result, its stake in BUS has fallen below 50 per cent, and analysts
expect that this year's losses will not have to be consolidated in the group
result for the 1993-94 year.
Meanwhile, urgent negotiations were continuing yesterday to sell off the
last of the so-called 'family silver' - the group's headquarters building in
the middle of Frankfurt. A private sale is possible, but failing that,
creditor banks have agreed to buy the building.
Although the scale of the asset disposals has far exceeded earlier
expectations, and deprived MG of rock-solid profit earners such as the
Buderus heating equipment group, it now appears that the bulk of the
sell-off is over and restructuring of the remnants can proceed.
But the questions and accusations which surfaced this week are likely to
return. They are scheduled to be aired in a Baltimore court room on October
14. There Mr Arthur Benson, a former senior executive at MG Marketing &amp;
Refining in New York, is due to claim Dollars 1bn compensation for the
damage to his reputation caused by his highly publicised sacking in the wake
of the oil futures debacle.
The US legal authorities, investigating associated events, are understood to
be especially interested in whether Deutsche Bank played any direct, active
role in unwinding the oil futures business, and thereby infringing strict US
regulations on banks' involvement in commodities contracts.
At the same time, it is unlikely that the last has been heard of complaints
from the anonymous 'committee'. This week's well-timed and well-publicised
arrival of its accusations in the state prosecutor's hands has roused
speculation that standing behind the shield of anonymity is a vengeful Mr
Heinz Schimmelbusch, MG's sacked and disgraced former chairman.

FT  30 SEP 94 / British Gas strategic review upbeat about dividend rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas yesterday predicted that a strong underlying performance in its
main UK businesses would enable it to increase future dividends. In a rare
public review of the company's strategy, senior executives told analysts in
London that a progressive dividend policy could be maintained as long there
were no more 'regulatory shocks'.
Its shares, however, closed 9 1/2 p lower yesterday at 290p.
The upbeat assessment of financial prospects contrasted sharply with two
dividend warnings British Gas issued earlier this year. Analysts said those
warnings were part of the company's negotiating tactics with the government
and Ofgas, its regulator, over the planned liberalisation of the domestic
gas market beginning in 1996.
Mr Richard Giordano, chairman, said the 'dense regulatory fog' which had
enveloped the company and resulted in a 'strategic paralysis' was beginning
to lift. British Gas was now confident enough to lay out a coherent way
forward for the rest of the decade.
This was in spite of the fact that the government has yet to decide whether
to bring forward legislation this year to open the domestic market.
The short-term financial performance would be underpinned by expected
improvements in the UK gas business, where Pounds 600m of costs would be
removed by 1998 through a radical restructuring in which 25,000 jobs would
go.
The reforms were running ahead of schedule, according to Mr Cedric Brown,
chief executive, who emphasised there were no 'sacred cows' within British
Gas, and that business units which failed to return adequate shareholder
value could be sold.
A sharp rise in natural gas production from existing offshore reserves in
the UK would account for most of the expected growth of cash flow to the
year 2000, he said.
UK businesses were also expected to receive the lion's share of Pounds 10bn
of capital expenditure planned over the next five years. TransCo, the gas
transportation and storage business, will absorb 35 per cent to 40 per cent
of the total, while the UK exploration and production business would receive
about 25 per cent.
But the maturity of the UK continental shelf and the domestic gas market
meant that long-term earnings growth would have to come from British Gas's
international ventures. These would account for 25 per cent to 30 per cent
of capital spending to 1999, but they would remain cash negative until the
next decade.
Mr Brown said the international strategy would be focused on regions where
there was growing demand for gas, such as Latin America, Southeast Asia and
Europe. It would also be 'market driven,' and would involve British Gas
forming a number of associate companies with strong local partners.
That change in structure was one of the main reasons for the announcement
yesterday that British Gas was replacing its earnings-based dividend policy
with one based on cash flows.
Over the next few years, profits from associated companies are likely to be
re-invested, rather than returned in dividends. 'To take full credit for
those profits in setting financial policy seems imprudent,' said Mr Philip
Rogerson, finance director. The cash-based system would ensure that only
actual cash receipts are taken into account. 'It will more accurately
reflect the changing shape and risk profile of British Gas and remove any
accounting distortions,' he added.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Attwoods claims evasion in BFI battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Attwoods, the UK waste services group, yesterday sought to throw off balance
the hostile Pounds 364m bid from Browning Ferris Industries of the US by
claiming the predator had evaded questions over possession of confidential
information.
The move was aimed at complicating preparations for the publication of BFI's
offer document, which is expected next week.
The UK company claimed that its major shareholder Laidlaw of Canada, was
selling to BFI at a cut price under pressure from its own shareholders.
Laidlaw agreed to sell its 29.8 per cent stake in Attwoods at 109p a share
nine days ago.
Attwoods said late yesterday evening that it was concerned that sensitive
price competitive information could have been passed to BFI by Laidlaw.
Three Laidlaw directors, including the chief executive Mr Jim Bullock who
negotiated the deal with BFI, sit on the Attwoods board.
Attwoods said they had received 'evasive answers' from both BFI and Laidlaw
about the bidder's information.
But BFI's corporate development director, Mr Greg Muldoon said: 'If they
believed we had anything price sensitive, they would be in court.'
The US company said the Laidlaw directors had provided geographical
background and historical information dating from 1991 and 1992. This was
not material and would not have to be disclosed in the offer document. BFI
said Attwoods was running scared from its offer. 'You have to ask what they
are so concerned that Laidlaw has, which should not be disclosed to
shareholders,' the company said.
Attwoods said it feared BFI would be able to use such information to its
advantage competitively if the bid failed. However, if BFI did not have
price sensitive information, 'it gives the lie to last week's whispers that
BFI bid at such a ludicrously low price because it knew something other
shareholders did not', said Mr Ken Foreman, chief executive.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Private investors to get discount in power sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday laid the ground for what could be its last
multi-billion pound disposal when it outlined plans to sell its remaining 40
per cent stakes in electricity generators National Power and PowerGen in
February. The sale is expected to raise about Pounds 4bn in three tranches,
between Pounds 1.2bn and Pounds 1.6bn of it in the current financial year.
At least two-fifths of the shares will be offered to private investors at
discount prices.
Rather than set up a share information office, the government will give
'share shops' of banks, building societies, stockbrokers and other financial
intermediaries an exclusive role in collecting registrations for the public
offer. Ministers argue that this will make investors more familiar with
share trading than if they dealt through an information office which would
be disbanded on the sale's completion.
Proceeds from the sale will dwarf those from any other privatisations before
the next general election, including a potential sale of 51 per cent of the
Post Office. Of industries remaining in the public sector, only Railtrack
could raise anything approaching Pounds 4bn but there are doubts both about
its value and the potential to sell it.
At yesterday's share prices, National Power had a market value of Pounds
5.8bn and PowerGen one of Pounds 4bn, valuing the government's respective
holdings at Pounds 2.3bn and Pounds 1.6bn.
The government said it expected to begin marketing the sale in January in
preparation for pricing the shares and offering them the following month.
Payments will be in three instalments, each of them in a different tax year.
The first is likely to be 30 to 40 per cent of the total.
The prices will be determined following bids from institutional investors in
two separate open-priced international tenders. The international offer will
include a retail tender to enable individuals to bid for shares in either or
both companies on similar terms to institutions.
Small investors in the UK will only be able to buy a package of shares in
both companies, with a pre-determined ratio, possibly three of National
Power to two of PowerGen.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd and Kleinwort Benson, advising the government, said
that if retail demand was strong, the 40 per cent allocation of shares to
the public could increase.
Discounts to the public will be reflected in a lower first instalment.
Existing shareholders will need to register with share shops to be eligible
for incentives and preferences in allocation over other applicants.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Redland to list in Frankfurt after strong German result
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Redland, the large British building materials group, is to seek a listing on
the Frankfurt stock exchange after announcing a 40 per cent rise in German
profits in the first half of this year.
Germany accounted for half of operating profits of Pounds 157m and 26 per
cent of turnover of Pounds 1.27bn. Redland's share price, however, fell 5
per cent yesterday in spite of a 36 per cent rise in group pre-tax profits
to Pounds 147.4m.
The 29p decline in the share price, to 493p, came after Redland revealed
that a higher than expected tax charge of 33.3 per cent in the first half
could climb to 35 per cent next year with higher German taxes.
Mr Robert Napier, chief executive, said the planned listing would let German
shareholders invest in Redland more efficiently. Shares acquired in
Frankfurt would be accompanied by profit participation certificates enabling
dividends to be paid out of German earnings. Under German tax arrangements,
local shareholders would receive 25 per cent more on average from dividends
paid in this way, after deductions, than under present arrangements, Mr
Napier said.
Redland is paying a maintained interim dividend of 8.25p on first-half
earnings per share up from 11p to 12.9p.
So far, there has been no easing in demand from the German housing market
where sales have been boosted by repairs to east German homes and
accommodation demands from large numbers of immigrants.
Housing permits, one of the best guides to future prospects, increased by 18
per cent in western Germany and 77 per cent in eastern Germany in the first
half of this year, said Redland.
The company owns 51 per cent of Braas, Germany's largest roof tile
manufacturer, which generates a fifth of its sales in eastern Germany. The
UK, which increased operating profits by 36 per cent to Pounds 19.2m,
accounted for 12 per cent of group profits and 21 per cent of turnover in
the first half. The UK figures were helped by higher sales and prices for
many building materials.
Overseas profits rose by a quarter from Pounds 95.2m to Pounds 119.7m
assisted by an improvement in continental European housing markets. French
profits recovered from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 6.6m. The contribution from
other continental European countries rose from Pounds 21.3m to Pounds 26.5m.
US profits, however, fell from Pounds 19m to Pounds 16.1m because of poor
winter weather in Maryland, and a reduced contribution from Florida where
roofing sales last year had risen sharply after Hurricane Andrew.

FT  30 SEP 94 / IMF offers Dollars 360m to support Ukraine reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The International Monetary Fund agreed yesterday to provide Ukraine with
Dollars 360m (Pounds 227.8m) in financial support and held out the prospect
of further funding, as long as the Kiev government introduces economic
reforms.
Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, said the loan, from the
IMF's systemic transformation facility to help former communist countries,
had 'all the potential to be the long awaited breakthrough' in bringing
order to Ukraine's economy.
But for it to succeed, Kiev would have to implement a 'strong package of
measures upfront' to restructure the economy and would need substantial
international financial support.
The IMF managing director said the agreement with Ukraine was a 'strong
first step' in the direction of economic reform. It involved a comprehensive
programme including price and exchange-rate stabilisation, a 'major effort'
to reduce the budget deficit, continuation of a tight monetary policy, a
pick-up in privatisation and restructuring of Ukraine's welfare system to
protect the most vulnerable groups.
The Dollars 360m will be handed to Ukraine once the programme has been
approved by the IMF board, probably next month. Mr Camdessus said
'considerably more assistance' would be available from the IMF in 1995 with
the Fund expecting to negotiate a stand-by credit agreement with Kiev early
next year.
However, IMF support would not be enough, Mr Camdessus said. He called on
other countries to pledge support to Ukraine during next week's annual
meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Madrid. This was an 'opportunity not
to be missed', he said.
But it is unclear how far other countries will take up Mr Camdessus's
suggestion. A Ukraine official said that Kiev is hoping for Dollars 1.5bn
from the industrialised countries as part of Dollars 4bn in support over two
years that was discussed by the Group of Seven leading industrial countries
at the July economic summit.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Insurers and watchdog at odds over pension sales
compensation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The City's chief regulator and the life insurance industry are deadlocked
over how to compensate people who could lose money from the mis-selling of
personal pensions.
The discord is a sign of the gulf between the Securities and Investments
Board and the life industry, which has become increasingly defensive after
public criticism of its practices.
The industry is refusing to set up a voluntary scheme to deal with
compensation claims for pension transfers - which some regulators now
believe could total Pounds 500m. Instead, cases will be handled within
existing compensation arrangements.
Details of how life companies should identify and compensate those who may
lose out because they took poor advice to opt or transfer out of an
occupational scheme will be published in an SIB report next month.
The report is also expected to confirm findings from a pilot study last
year, suggesting that up to a third of the 500,000 or more total pension
transfers since 1988 could have been based on poor advice.
The existing Investors Compensation Scheme, operated by the SIB together
with the industry, acts as a safety net for those entitled to redress who
find that the adviser responsible for their plight has ceased to trade.
The government and the regulator wanted separate arrangements for pension
transfers, to avoid the risk that they would swamp the current scheme.
Compensation claims in a pension transfer case go first to the life company
or independent financial adviser which mis-sold the pension. The ombudsman
for the Personal Investment Authority, the new regulator to protect the
private investor, will probably intervene in any dispute.
For the life industry, the most sensitive compensation issue is paying
claims against independent advisers who have gone out of business. Such
cases will now be handled by the ICS. A special unit is be set up within the
PIA to deal with inquiries from customers of such firms.
The scale of potential mis-selling indicated in next month's report is
likely to be a cause fresh of conflict between the SIB and the life
companies. Many life companies dismissed the pilot study, as it was based
entirely on files rather than talking to sales agents and customers. They
said the problem was one of record-keeping rather than of poor advice.

FT  30 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Fiat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fiat's management should be congratulated for extricating the company so
rapidly from the most wretched period in its history. The battered car maker
is back in the black far quicker than expected, partly because of the
market, but in no small measure, thanks to timely self-help. The lira's
devaluation also assisted, aiding exports and making competitors' products
more expensive in Italy. The Brazilian experience also augurs well for
international sales. The 34 per cent fall in net debt was a pleasant
surprise. A further recovery can be expected when the Italian market,
representing more than 40 per cent of automotive sales, finally recovers.
The management's determined cost cutting has been particularly impressive.
In only 12 months, overheads as a percentage of sales have been slashed 2.8
percentage points to 13.6 per cent. Production costs have also been sharply
reduced. A new engine plant, and two new assembly plants in southern Italy
where Fiat can take advantage of lower wage costs, are both making their
mark.
Such rationalisation was necessary for Fiat's survival, but the group's
success is by no means assured. Fiat must continue to prepare for 1999 when
the Japanese will enter the Italian market without hindrance. Everything
will depend on the group's new products, an area in which Fiat lacks
credibility. The recently-launched Punto may have been a hit, but the jury
is out on other models. Fiat cannot afford another Dollars 32bn of
rationalisation and investment. This is an all or nothing throw of the dice.

FT  30 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Forte
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At last life is starting to look up for Forte. It has clinched the deal to
buy Meridien from Air France and seen new management installed at the Savoy.
Room rates are finally rising at its London hotels. Group first-half profits
are up more than 62 per cent. Disposals have helped reduce gearing to 44 per
cent, giving Forte flexibility in deciding how to finance its Meridien
purchase. With such a long list of achievements, it is curious that Forte's
dividend is unchanged.
Perhaps the company does not want to get too carried away with its own
recovery story. Competitive pressure remains strong in the UK provinces
where higher occupancy has been bought at the expense of lower room rates.
That will be slow to improve given surplus capacity in the market. Even the
high returns from the expanding Travelodge chain are unlikely to last for
ever as other operators flood the market.
But the broader reason for caution is that cash flow is not rising in line
with profits. First-half free cash flow of Pounds 31m looks unsatisfactory
in the context of an annual dividend cost of Pounds 64m. Part of the reason
is that Forte is still weighed down by its debts. Interest cover, though
rising, is only 2.4 times even without counting off-balance sheet lease
charges. Now the recession is over, Forte is also stepping up its
refurbishment spending. It seems hotels eat up cash as soon as it flows in.
Sceptics always wondered where Forte's cash would come from after it sold
its contract catering businesses. It has yet to prove their concern
unfounded.

FT  30 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Redland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong growth in the UK, France and Germany prompted the City to raise its
profit estimates for Redland yesterday. But the shares still fell 5 per cent
on the group's disclosure that its tax rate is set to rise towards 35 per
cent next year, after 30.5 per cent in 1993. The full upturn in pre-tax
profits will thus not feed through to earnings.
There are good explanations why Redland's tax charge should be rising
sharply when that of RMC, which also derives the largest share of its
profits from Germany, is not. One is that Redland's investment programme in
the east of Germany is coming to an end, and capital allowances are petering
out as a result. But the surprise nevertheless rekindles scepticism about
Redland's dividends policy. The tax bill would not be so high now if the
group had not maintained a barely covered dividend throughout the trough of
the UK recession. Coupled with the near doubling of shares in issue over the
past three years, this policy has increased the burden of unrelieved Advance
Corporation Tax.
Ironically, this makes it impossible for Redland to raise its dividend now,
when the underlying operating performance might justify it. While a yield of
over 6 per cent offers some support, the contrast with RMC is stark. This
more conservatively managed company increased its interim dividend by 6.1
per cent last week. Redland will not easily correct its under-performance of
more than a fifth against RMC in the past year.

British Gas mouthed all the right words at its strategy presentation
yesterday. After years of moaning that unfair treatment by its regulator was
undermining its business, Gas set out a plan to increase earnings and cash
flow. Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive, said the group was at the start of a
'complete and radical transformation'. He also promised an 'aggressive'
dividend policy, reversing earlier threats to cut the pay-out.
Nevertheless, Gas's shares fell by over 3 per cent. Investors appear to like
the change in language but are waiting to see whether Gas can deliver the
goods. There can be no guarantee. Gas is looking to exploration in the UK
continental shelf and overseas investments as the source of profits growth.
But it has yet to prove it has the skills to succeed in these markets. The
group's exploration and development costs of Pounds 5 per barrel of oil
equivalent are higher than those of world leaders.
There are also doubts over what Gas brings to overseas investments. The
group claims its competitive advantage comes from experience in all parts of
the gas chain - from the 'drill bit right the way through to the burner
tip'. But one wonders how well managers who have grown up in a monopoly
culture will cope in free-wheeling third world markets. Mr Richard Giordano,
Gas's relatively new chairman, was candid enough to admit that 'our
commercial skills are limited' and promised to recruit two new executive
directors from outside the group. Investing in Gas is now largely a bet on
how successful he will be in changing its culture.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Pay policy fails to curb earnings in public sector: Rises
average 2.5 per cent in spite of Treasury limits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's policy of pay restraint in the public sector is failing to
contain market pressures for higher earnings, according to an official
survey published yesterday.
Rises in the public sector averaged 2.5 per cent in the 12 months to April,
the annual New Earnings Survey revealed, and came in spite of a 1.5 per cent
pay norm imposed by the Treasury and a three-year public sector pay bill
freeze.
The government's own employees enjoyed an average 3.9 per cent earnings
rise, with substantial increases of 7.5 per cent for women secretaries and
typists in the civil service and 6.8 per cent for staff in scientific and
professional grades.
Senior and middle-ranking male civil servants enjoyed 3.7 per cent average
earnings increases, twice the size of the government's pay target.
'This provides clear evidence that governments can no longer control pay
from the centre. The Treasury's policy is not working out as it was
intended. Politicians can no longer run incomes policies like they did 30
years ago,' said Mr Chris Trinder, research director of the independent
Public Finance Foundation.
For the first time since 1990, private sector increases, which averaged 2.8
per cent, moved ahead of public sector rises.
The annual survey published by the Department of Employment provides a
comprehensive picture of pre-tax earnings for full-time employees. It is
based on information from employers and the sample covers 1 per cent of
workers employed over the pay period which included early April. It excludes
part-timers and the self-employed.
Other key findings in this year's survey show:
The average pre-tax weekly earnings for all full-time employees were Pounds
325.70 in April with a median figure of Pounds 282 a week. The level of pay
rises was greater for women (3.5 per cent) than for men (2.4 per cent),
while white-collar employees had an average 2.9 per cent increase compared
with 2.4 per cent for manual workers.
The level of female earnings relative to those of men has narrowed to 79.5
per cent - its smallest since the survey began in 1970. This reflects the
continuing decline in male full-time employment and increase in the size of
the female full-time workforce.
There has been a slight narrowing in the spread of earnings rises this year,
with a 3.5 per cent rise in the weekly earnings of the bottom 10 per cent of
the employed workforce while the earnings of the top 10 per cent increased
by 2.9 per cent.
The bottom 10 per cent earned less than Pounds 158 a week, 44 per cent below
the median, while the top 10 per cent of employees earned over Pounds 525 a
week, 86 per cent above the median.
Young workers' earnings rose more slowly than any other age group with an
actual drop of 0.1 per cent for male manual workers under the age of 18 and
a rise of only 1.5 per cent for those between 18 and 20. Women aged 18 to 20
secured a 0.7 per cent earnings rise with a decline of 0.2 per cent for
female non-manual workers.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Defying the cruel sea
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ferries are among the safest vessels afloat. But, as the tragic sinking of
the Estonia with the loss of more than 800 lives demonstrates, when they do
go down the toll in human life can be high.
As ferries increase in size, so the numbers on board at risk from mechanical
failure or a crew error go up. The move to roll-on roll-off ferries with
vehicle decks which run the entire length of the vessel has increased the
risk that, once the sea penetrates the hold through the bow doors or a gash
in the ship's side, it can lead to the vessel capsizing.
The United Nations International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and its
members, the ship-owning nations, have devoted much thought over the past
two decades to ship safety. But the sinking of the Estonia should lead to a
new review of ferry safety. Particularly worrying are the eyewitness reports
which suggest that water penetrated the bow doors in a manner reminiscent of
the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise in 1987. Unlike the Herald, the
Estonia appears to have had its doors closed, but ro-ros are undoubtedly
very vulnerable to water penetration.
Any review of ferry safety should focus on three main issues. First the
subject of ferry design should be reconsidered. Additional stability could
be provided by the addition of sponsons, stabilising bulges which project
from the ship's side just above the water line. Greater resistance to an
influx of water could be obtained by installing moveable barriers or
bulkheads to break up the large car decks. These proposals were looked at by
the British government in the wake of the sinking of the Herald of Free
Enterprise. It calculated that it would cost between Pounds 70m and Pounds
85m to improve standards on the 57 vessels in the UK ferry fleet, with a
further Pounds 22m in extra annual running costs.
Higher costs would inevitably lead to higher fares - unwelcome to ferry
operators when, on the short cross-Channel routes, they face competition
from the Channel tunnel. But the difficulty of pushing through fare rises
would be nothing like as damaging to the ferry companies as another
disaster.
Second, the IMO and national governments must look closely at how to improve
enforcement of existing regulations. The IMO has been trying to move
enforcement up its agenda, but it depends on the good will and
professionalism of governments and shipowners. Third, the IMO should be
given support by national governments in its campaign, launched yesterday,
to improve crew training. Much of the regulation in recent years has
concentrated on improving the ship and its equipment.
Above all, if new regulation does turn out to be necessary, it must be
introduced speedily. As things stand, it can take years before changes are
ratified by enough governments to give them force. The European Union, which
Sweden and Finland are getting ready to join, could take a lead in speeding
up the process.
Ship safety is not, of course, just an issue for the ferry sector. Five
(small) ferries were lost last year, according to Lloyd's Register. But this
figure pales into insignificance compared with the 96 general cargo ships
and 12 tankers which also went down.
When a cargo vessel with a third-world crew goes down in a distant ocean,
very little attention is paid. If the loss of a relatively modern passenger
vessel in European waters can make shipping safety a higher priority for
governments and the public, this will be some small compensation for the
loss of life from the Estonia.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Can anyone really believe themselves a failure after knocking up 2,066 runs
in an English county cricket season?
But Brian Lara reckons he let down his county club, Warwickshire, at certain
crucial moments. In his latest newspaper column in his native Trinidad and
Tobago, he singles out his score of 81 runs - a good one-day knock by
anyone's standards - in the NatWest one-day final, which Worcestershire went
on to win. Warwickshire, already having won the County Championship, and the
Benson and Hedges Cup were thus prevented from cleaning up all the major
titles.
'People praised my innings and said it was my biggest one-day score, but I
felt guilty that I got out at the wrong time,' says Lara.
However, one man who is happy that Lara got out when he did is Richard
Flavell, a director of Lombard Risk Systems. Flavell, a maths wizard, came
closest to guessing the difference between the number of first-class runs
scored by Lara and the Footsie close on Monday September 19 - the final day
of the English cricket season. Although Lara has nearly doubled his runs
since the contest started in June and the index has only added 79 points,
the Gifted One was still trailing by 1,013 points when the game ended.
A Methuselah of Veuve Cliquot - courtesy of Simon Rostron, the City PR man
who suggested the challenge - will be on its way shortly.

Two consortia bid to build an underground railway in Thessaloniki in
northern Greece. One is Greek-led, the other a Franco-Canadian combine. So
which does the government back? Well, it's not the home team.
Despite the fact that Macedonian Metro - led by the country's biggest
construction company Mechaniki - came up with the lower bid of Dr120bn
(Dollars 500m), it now seems to be out of the running. The committee set up
by the public works ministry to evaluate the project did not bother to meet
the consortium partners and simply rejected their financing arrangements as
'insecure'.
This prompted an apopletic Prodromos Emfietzoglou, Mechaniki's founder
chairman, to attack the government. He has been waving around copies of
letters from the European Investment Bank offering to finance half the cost
of the project, another from Germany's state-owned development aid bank
Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KFW) for another 40 per cent, and a third
from Citibank and others offering a further 15 per cent.
To add insult to injury, Emfietzoglou knows the committee's chairman,
Kyriakos Anastasiades - they were classmates at engineering school. Their
paths have subsequently diverged, however. The former has risen to the very
top of Mechaniki, while Anastasiades remains a poorly paid professor of
civil engineering at the country's Thessaloniki University.
Tut tut. Not a touch of professional jealousy, surely?

Good for Credit Lyonnais, which has not forgotten how to have a giggle even

It has been placing full-page advertisements in the French press this week
under the banner: 'Here are the bad results that everyone was waiting for.'
Which British bank would have the chutzpah to conceive of any such thing?
Then again, no British bank is underwritten by the state, thankfully.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Observer: Manek's City challenge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Forget Lenny Licht, the former Mercury Asset Management investment star who
was lured away to Jupiter Tyndall with a Pounds 1m-plus golden hello.
Wembley's Jayesh Manek, 38, who runs a small chain of chemists shops and
dabbles in the stock market, sounds as if he could slaughter go-go fund
managers like Licht at their own game.
People in the City are starting to talk about Manek, a 38-year-old Ugandan
Asian, because he keeps on winning The Sunday Times's weekly Fantasy Fund
Manager competition.
True it's only a game and since Manek's money is not on the line he can
afford to take much bigger risks than any normal fund manager. Even so the
consistency of his winning and the size of his gains is starting to be
noticed.
Since the competition started at the end of May, the FT-SE 100 has risen by
less than 30 points, yet Manek's JP Growth fund has grown from Pounds 10m to
Pounds 92.6m. More than 40,000 people are playing the game, yet 10 of
Manek's funds appear in the top 50 performers. He has been helped by picking
small highly-speculative stocks such as Middlesex Holdings, United Breweries
and Anglo United. However, he is not playing the options markets.
Manek spends three to four hours a week plotting his investment strategy.
His one luxury is a computer technical analysis programme, but he gets most
of his information from the Financial Times and the Investors Chronicle.
He has not yet had a City headhunter knocking on his door. But if his
winning streak continues much longer, he may well get an offer he might find
hard to refuse.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Cost of ignorance: Robert Rice explains the power that the
shadowy body of the European Court has over businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's employers face costs of billions of pounds in extending pension
rights to part-time workers, after rulings this week by the European Court
of Justice on sex discrimination in pensions.
They have reacted with particular anger to the ruling that part-timers could
claim pensions retrospectively if they had been excluded from company
schemes after a 1976 judgment by the same court.
To many businesses, Wednesday's judgment giving part-time workers pension
rights stretching back 18 years seems neither fair nor reasonable.
The court's answer was that it had been clear since 1976 that the equal
treatment rules of the Rome treaty have direct effect and that they cover
the right to join occupational pension schemes. If employers had bothered to
examine the case law, they would have known the court was going to reach
that decision.
Mr David Vaughan QC, a European law expert, agrees: 'No one who had been
following developments could have been very surprised. Companies must have
known this was on the way. If they had asked, they would have been told. But
they didn't. They hoped it would go away.'
There remains widespread ignorance about the power of European institutions
over national laws. Most Europeans know and accept that Brussels makes rules
and regulations which as citizens of the European Union they are bound by.
What they know much less about is the role that the European Court of
Justice plays in shaping those rules and regulations.
The court is one of the four institutions of the EU - the others are the
European Commission, the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.
The court interprets the growing body of laws governing the EU and the wider
European marketplace.
It ensures the even-handed implementation of Brussels legislation by the
member states of the Union. It also acts as a check on the growing power of
Brussels on behalf of the member states, individuals and companies. And the
court goads the Commission and Council into action where they have neglected
their obligations under the Treaty of Rome.
Its role is central, yet it remains for the most part in the shadows. As a
result, it is regularly confused with the European Court of Human Rights in
Strasbourg, which is responsible for enforcing the European Convention on
Human Rights. It is the ECHR, for example, which will decide whether Mr
Ernest Saunders, the former Guinness chairman, was denied a fair trial in
1989.
The court's judges are drawn from the judiciaries and legal professions of
the member states. They are 13 in number, assisted by six advocates general
who act as advisers.
There is no nationality requirement, but at present the court has one judge
from each member state. They are appointed by 'common accord' of the
governments of member states - in effect, they are nominated by their own
administrations. Their appointment is for a renewable term of six years.
Every three years there is a partial replacement of the court, with seven
and six judges replaced alternately.
Although the judges are effectively political nominees, they are
constitutionally independent.
'The critical thing is that they aren't accountable,' says Mr Vaughan. 'If
they were, they would always be at the beck and call of their governments.'
He accepts that in the past some judges have modified their behaviour when
their time for reappointment drew close. But in general the court has stood
up well to pressure and abuse from governments when it has done things they
did not like, Mr Vaughan says.
To offer the judges additional protection from political interference, the
court's deliberations are kept secret and all its judgments are unanimous.
Dissenting judgments are not allowed. 'That's why some judgments look like a
fudge,' says European barrister Mr Fergus Randolph. 'They are a fudge.'
Lord Slynn, a Law Lord and former British judge at the court, is in favour
of introducing some way of enabling judges to register dissent so that the
differing views can be properly reflected. He believes this would aid
understanding of the European legal process.
But others are against this, believing that it would increase political
pressure on the judges. 'The British government would probably be tolerant
if its judges kept voting against it, but I'm not sure all the other
countries would,' says Mr Vaughan.
If member states feel that the court has gone badly wrong on an issue, they
can - as a last resort - refer the judgment to the next intergovernmental
conference when the Rome treaty is revised. This happened at Maastricht
where a protocol was added to the treaty limiting the effect of the 1990
Barber judgment on equal pensions to rights accrued after the May 1990 date
of the ruling.
However, the issue of retrospective pension rights for part-time workers is
unlikely to feature at the next intergovernmental conference in 1996. Given
the history of court judgments on equal treatment since 1976, there is
unlikely to be political support for reopening the issue.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Poised for the political pay-off: Brazil's rosy economic
outlook is likely to carry Fernando Cardoso to victory in Monday's election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazilians vote for a new president on Monday hoping that nearly a decade of
high inflation and bad government is over and a new cycle of economic growth
can begin.
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the former academic turned social democratic
politician, is now clear favourite to win the election. If he succeeds, his
popularity and the improving health of the economy will put him in a strong
position to modernise Brazil's economy and political system.
'He could change the country completely and we would go back to growing at 7
per cent a year,' according to Mr Fernando de Hollanda Barbosa, a Rio de
Janeiro-based economist.
Optimism about the country's outlook has been spreading since the
introduction in July of a new currency, the Real, which led to a fall in the
inflation rate from 50 per cent in June to less than 2 per cent this month.
The Real's success ignited the election campaign of Mr Cardoso who, as
finance minister, planned the currency before resigning to run for
president.
Brazil has seen false dawns before, most recently when optimism following
the 1989 election of former president Fernando Collor turned to despair
after he resigned amid corruption charges.
And the country's social problems, including one of the biggest gaps between
rich and poor in the world, will require more than one successful
presidential term to solve. So Mr Cardoso's advisers are anxious that their
candidate should win in the first round of voting to give him the 'flying
start' needed to allow him to force urgent measures through Congress during
the first three months of his presidency.
In order to win on Monday, Mr Cardoso needs to poll more votes than all his
competitors combined. He looks likely to do so. If not, the top two
candidates contest a run-off in November. Opinion polls suggest Mr Cardoso
has about 44 per cent support, well ahead of his nearest rival, the
leftwinger Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva who has about 22 per cent. If Mr da
Silva can force a run-off, polls suggest Mr Cardoso would win easily.
The measures at the top of Mr Cardoso's priority list are those needed to
consolidate the Real and keep inflation low. The new currency succeeded in
reducing inflation partly because the government managed to keep this year's
budget balanced. However, this was achieved only by emergency spending cuts
and higher than expected tax revenues. Budget problems are set to return and
worsen next year.
Mr Cardoso is therefore likely to call for a sweeping fiscal reform to try
and solve the budget difficulties. According to advisers, his priorities
will be to increase the overall tax burden from the present level of 25 per
cent of gross domestic product. He also wants to reduce constitutionally
imposed limits which force the federal government to spend more than 70 per
cent of its revenues on wage bills and transfers to states and
municipalities. Increasing tax revenues will be difficult because many
Brazilians have become adept at evading tax. Persuading state governments to
cut spending targets will also be tricky, especially since several state
governors, who also face elections on Monday, are likely to be opponents of
Mr Cardoso.
Urgent reform is also needed for Brazil's social security system, the bill
for which has risen from Dollars 7.8bn in 1988 to Dollars 24bn this year,
partly because of generous retirement provisions. The government has paid
the bill by transferring money from the health service, which has declined
rapidly as a result.
These reforms have been discussed for some time, and were meant to have been
agreed during a recent constitutional revision in Congress. But the process
failed because Congressmen were not prepared to support unpopular measures
such as cutting social spending in an election year.
Mr Cardoso has a better chance of pushing changes through the new Congress,
which will not face the same election pressures for another four years.
In Congress he is supported by his small Social Democratic party (PSDB), the
larger, rightwing Liberal Front (PFL), as well as several smaller parties.
According to Mr Paulo Calmon, a political consultant, this should give him a
majority in Congress with about 60 per cent support. He is also likely to be
supported by the governors from some of Brazil's most important states,
including Sao Paulo.
But political ties in Brazil owe more to personal links than to party
allegiance, and this could lead to problems for Mr Cardoso.
The alliance between the PSDB and the PFL, for example, was a reaction to
the threat of the leftwing Mr da Silva. The two parties share little common
ideology.
Many PFL members worked with Brazil's military governments which ruled
between 1964 and 1985, leaving their democratic credentials in doubt. Others
are linked with the nepotism and corruption common in Brazil's backward
north-east.
Mr Cardoso and other PSDB leaders, meanwhile, campaigned against the
military and corruption and come from the country's south.
Mr Cardoso's advisers say the alliance agrees on the main task for his
presidency: the reform of the Brazilian state. Brazil's state-led
development model, which was responsible for what its supporters call the
'economic miracle' of high growth in the 1970s, has since suffered from
years of bad management while inflation almost bankrupted the government.
'We need a new model of development with social justice,' Mr Cardoso says.
His comments on social justice are welcomed by most analysts, especially
since social divisions have worsened with Brazil's economic problems. The
richest 1 per cent now earn more than the poorest 50 per cent. Years of
inflation and spending cuts led to under-investment in education and
healthcare which will take time and money to redress.
Mr Cardoso's opponents say his plans to reduce the size of the state are
worrying. They say that the state provides crucial support for many poorer
people in Brazil, where 20 per cent of workers earn less than Dollars 70 a
month. 'Any attempt to reduce government costs will certainly worsen social
problems and hurt millions of people,' says to Mr Antonio Correa do Prado, a
Sao Paulo-based economist.
Mr Cardoso says he wants better, rather than less, government spending and
that total government investment in his four-year term would reach Dollars
100bn. About half this total is expected to come from foreign investment and
the private sector - the latter including Dollars 15bn from privatisation,
more than double the amount raised in the last four years.
If inflation remains low, foreign investors' interest in Brazil could grow.
Enthusiasm about Mr Cardoso's election chances has already led to record
inflows of foreign capital. Last month there was a net inflow of Dollars
1.51bn. Most went into the stock exchange, which has risen 45 per cent since
the Real's launch.
Direct investment has also grown, although less rapidly. Investors are
attracted by Brazil's market of 157m people and its private sector, which
analysts agree is Latin America's most dynamic. Companies have restructured
since 1990 as import protections fell and exports rose 24 per cent between
1990 and 1993 to reach Dollars 38.8bn. Sao Paulo state now exports more than
Argentina.
This growing economic strength, and the success so far of the Real, could
give Mr Cardoso the best chance for many years to attack Brazil's problems.
But progress will be slow because of the scale of what remains to be done,
and the fact that reforms were neglected when inflation was high.
'You cannot expect to solve Brazil's problems with a few miracle measures in
the first few months of a presidency,' Mr Cardoso says. 'But we do now have
the conditions to confront our problems and resume economic growth.'

FT  30 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Italy's fight
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's fiscal policymakers appear to have pulled off another high-wire
escape act. In reality, however, the performance has only just begun. The
government of Mr Silvio Berlusconi this week agreed spending cuts and
revenue increases intended to keep next year's budget deficit to 8 per cent
of gross domestic product.
The measures fall short of a totally convincing demonstration of Italy's
will to put its finances in order. Yet by starting a reform of the country's
over-generous health and pensions systems, the Berlusconi government is at
last showing signs of the resolve necessary to tackle its most intractable
fiscal problems. Mr Berlusconi now has to maintain that effort without
provoking further strains on the international financial markets or
political and social disruption at home.
The fractious Rome coalition has shown unusual unity in reaching a budget
accord closely in line with advice from the Italian Treasury. However, the
risks have been underlined by the trade unions' call for a one-day general
strike next month against cuts in pension entitlements. Unions' quiescence
on wages in the past two years has contributed to Italy's much-improved
competitiveness. If they now make a determined effort to scupper the
pensions reform, the coalition's mettle will be sorely tested.
An additional cause for anxiety is that some official assumptions behind the
budgetary arithmetic look optimistic. This year's 3 percentage point rise in
real interest rates on Italian bonds, now yielding roughly 8 per cent over
the inflation rate, reflects investors' nervousness about the high level of
Italian debt as well as scepticism about repeated official promises to bring
it under control.
Italian bond-holders may shudder to recall that only two years ago, when
Italy left the European exchange rate mechanism, the previous Ciampi
government presented a medium-term plan to reduce the deficit to 4.7 per
cent of GDP by 1995. If long-term Italian interest rates stay at the level
to which they have risen since the summer, high debt service costs will cast
doubt on the government's ability to meet next year's much less ambitious
deficit target.
Mr Berlusconi owed his March election victory to broad agreement in Italy
that the country needed a radical break with past political and economic
practices. But the advantage he enjoyed in appearing to offer a fresh start
has withered during a summer of inaction, while the danger of a financial
crisis has grown.
In truth, the Berlusconi government has no option but to tackle fiscal
reform - not piecemeal but root and branch. In spite of a level of taxation
already well above the OECD average, Italy cannot escape further cuts in
government spending and benefits, as well as a significant increase in tax
revenues - from improved collection or higher taxes. The recent experience
of Ireland or even the UK shows that it is not impossible to achieve a
substantial adjustment to a country's fiscal position in a relatively short
time.
Mr Berlusconi's task is first to convince the electorate that such
adjustment is necessary, and then to carry it out in a manner that spreads
the pain as equitably as possible. He has taken the first steps in what will
be a long and difficult journey. In the meantime, the 4 percentage point
differential between yields on lira and D-Mark bonds underlines the gap
between the scale of the challenge and the government's perceived ability to
master it. Having decided to proceed with the budget, the prime minister
must move quickly to bridge that gap.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Ratifying Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Uruguay Round is apparently never safe. Now the problem is ratification,
which is supposed to be finished this year. But difficulties are arising,
not least in the US.
Mr Clinton can be criticised on many counts, but on trade - with the major
exception of his administration's narrow-minded approach to Japan  - he has
been largely right. He did succeed in ratifying the North American Free
Trade Agreement and completing the Uruguay Round negotiations. He is right
now to insist that the Senate should stay in session until the round is
ratified.
Time has run short, partly because Mr Clinton delayed too long in trying to
gain acceptance of a new 'fast track' negotiating authority that covered
labour standards and the environment. By introducing the bill only last
Tuesday, the president gave the initiative to the protectionist chairman of
the Senate commerce committee, Ernest Hollings, who has the power to hold
hearings for 45 days. That would take the vote beyond the planned date of
adjournment, next week.
Mr Clinton is asking the Senate to return after a recess for the
congressional elections. There should then be enough time to complete
ratification before the newly elected Senate replaces the present one next
year. Otherwise, the bill would lapse and might prove difficult to revive.
The issue must be understood. It is not whether Mr Clinton, the Democrats or
the Republicans 'win'. It is whether the US will take a big step in the
direction it has pursued for half a century, or turn its back on its
achievements and the world's hopes.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Personal View: Ukraine's blueprint - President Leonid Kuchma
outlines the case for further aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By President LEONID KUCHMA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Ukraine became an independent country in 1991, it was poorly prepared.
The state lacked el-ementary na-tional institutions, and our terms of trade
deteriorated sharply, as Russia raised its energy prices in 1992, leading to
a severe structural balance of payments deficit.
During the past couple of years, Ukraine has also been the victim of
misconceived economic policies. As a result, it was hit by hyperinflation of
10,155 per cent in 1993, as well as a drastic fall in production, a sharp
decline in the standard of living, and corruption. But to its credit,
Ukraine enjoyed democratic presidential elections and a smooth transfer of
power this summer.
By 1994, the economy was in a terrible state, with two overwhelming problems
facing the country. First, the budget deficit was projected at 20 per cent
of gross domestic product for this year. Second, our trade deficit was
running at Dollars 3bn a year. I have made the solution of these two
challenges my political priority, because if they are not brought under
control, the very survival of Ukraine could be endangered.
To make my priorities clear to the international community, I invited Mr
Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, as
my first official foreign guest after being elected president of Ukraine in
July. Two months later, Ukraine concluded its first agreement with the IMF,
on a Systemic Transformation Facility (STF), finally signed yesterday.
We are initiating comprehensive economic reforms in Ukraine, drawing on the
successful experiences of other countries in transition from administrative
command economies to a market economy.
We have been successful in maintaining our budgetary revenue at about 40 per
cent of gross domestic product. But our first step will be to bring down the
budget deficit for this year to 10 per cent of GDP.
To accomplish this, we have decided to undertake some important reforms. We
shall unify our exchange rate and abolish all import subsidies, although
that will bring about substantial price increases of imported oil and
natural gas. Similarly, to reduce large subsidies for coal, we shall allow
the domestic price of coal to rise. Certain agricultural prices will also
have to rise, and rents will be gradually increased to reduce housing
subsidies, but compensation will be given to the disadvantaged and a social
safety net will be developed.
The National Bank of Ukraine is already pursuing a responsible monetary
policy. It has brought inflation down to 2.5 per cent a month in both July
and August of this year, though certain parliamentary decisions in August
have led to a number of agricultural credits that have boosted inflation in
September and depressed the free market exchange rate.
The second step will be taken at the beginning of next year. It is my
intention that Ukraine shall conclude a fully-fledged 'stand-by' agreement
with the IMF this year. I then want my government to implement a
macro-economic stabilisation programme. The budget deficit must not be
larger than can be financed - at about 5 per cent of GDP.
Prices will be further liberalised and domestic trade completely so. All
remaining export restrictions can then be abolished. In parallel, I intend
to activate small-scale privatisation and initiate a mass privatisation
before the end of this year.
Our present tax system is a shambles, with far too many loopholes and tax
rebates. I have instructed my administration to put the system into order
before December. Draft legislation has already been drawn up, cutting tax
rebates to reasonable levels by international standards.
The short-term symbol of success will be the stabilisation of the national
currency, the hryvnia, in terms of both domestic prices and the exchange
rate. Therefore, I want to peg the exchange rate of our currency from the
beginning of 1995 and exchange our provisional coupon currency for our
national currency. Its stability will symbolise Ukraine's maturing
statehood.
The people of Ukraine have decided to put the economy right and we are
prepared to bear the costs of adjustment. However, our economic situation is
difficult, and our imports have already been reduced to a bare minimum.
Further reductions would cause more suffering than I can justify to my
people.
I am appealing to the international community to provide Ukraine with
serious financial support now that Ukraine has become serious about
reforming its economy. We are already working closely with the IMF, the
World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, but we
shall need bilateral financing from the Group of Seven and other western
countries, as well as Russia, which is de facto our main creditor.
The G7 promised Ukraine financial support of Dollars 4bn at its Naples
summit in July. This should now be forthcoming.
Ukraine's need for international financing is quite obvious. Even after
severe cuts in our imports, the current account is likely to amount to
Dollars 3bn next year. Essentially, the whole deficit is being caused by
imports of oil and natural gas from Russia. Therefore, international
financing needs to be made available for our energy payments to Russia.
Our international reserves are run down and they need to be replenished by
at least Dollars 1bn. In order to introduce the hryvnia, Ukraine will need a
stabilisation fund of Dollars 1.5bn, so that a stable exchange rate can be
defended. Altogether our financial needs for 1995 amount to Dollars 5.5bn,
and the IMF has assessed our balance of payments need for the rest of this
year at almost Dollars 1bn.
A first tranche of the STF will provide us with Dollars 360m, but that will
not be enough. We have proposed to the US that Dollars 200m of unused
technical assistance grants be transformed into balance of payments grants.
For the rest, we hope for matching funds from other countries.
One of Ukraine's many advantages is that its foreign debt is actually
limited, at about Dollars 7bn, including the arrears on energy deliveries
from Russia and Turkmenistan, while we estimate that our total export of
goods and services will amount to Dollars 15bn this year. A large part of
our current debt consists of arrears that need to be regulated and
rescheduled so that we can repay them.
As our economy becomes more open, we also hope to attract substantial
foreign investment. With an excellent geographical location and a highly
educated labour force, Ukraine is well placed to achieve high economic
growth in the future.
But our chances of success will be greater if we receive appropriate
international financial support to facilitate our transition until private
investments start flowing in.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Bank loan would open door to a
pension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GEOFF ARNOLD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with some interest the comments from Roger Key, partner at
consulting actuaries, R Watson, concerning retrospective pension accrual for
part-time workers ('The European pensions ruling', September 29).
Mr Key is reported as saying that, in the context of contributory schemes,
part-time workers were unlikely to have the sums necessary to buy
retrospective benefits.
In order to protect the financial interests of such employees, I feel that
it is important to take issue with this view. Consider the simplified
example of a part-time worker who is one month from normal retirement date
with back-service to 1976.
A short-term bank loan could be taken to pay for past employee
contributions. In principle, one month later such a loan can be repaid in
full from tax-free cash arising from the pension benefits. The pensioner
would then be free to enjoy the residual pension in return for a nil net
outlay.
A little creative thought will also produce solutions for less convenient
cases (eg, exploiting any early retirement provisions or exploring the
practicalities of waiting until retirement date before claiming past pension
rights).

Sir, I share Barry Riley's optimism in his article on accounting frameworks
('Prudence and pragmatism in German reporting', September 28) that good
financial statements will eventually drive out the bad. I wonder, however,
whether Europe can or should wait that long?
Faced with a requirement for new capital, it will be increasingly tempting
for companies to look to the integrated capital market of the US, where the
financial reporting rules, although onerous, are coherent. The implications
for the fragmented equity markets of Europe are clear.
European accounting standards setters, governmental or private sector, must
work fast to provide a financial reporting framework that truly matches the
concept of the single market.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: IFC record shows that it still has a
role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARK CONSTANTINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'Frontier finance' (September 21), questions whether the
International Finance Corporation (IFC) still has a useful role to play in
promoting private sector development. Based on our record performance during
the 1994 financial year - almost Dollars 2.5bn approved for 231 projects in
65 countries - this question is, to say the least, rather surprising. In
fact, IFC's rapid growth over the past few years demonstrates that our role,
far from being undermined, is broader than ever.
IFC welcomes the increase in private investment into developing countries,
where we have been building local capital markets for 25 years. To cite just
one example, IFC introduced the country fund as an investment vehicle. We
like to think we helped develop today's emerging market industry.
Even in countries that have access to the international capital markets, IFC
can play a very important role. For example, we invest directly in the
second-tier companies that typically have difficulty raising long-term
finance, and provide credit lines to local financial institutions for
lending on to small- and medium-sized companies.
Moreover, despite the current interest in emerging markets, more than 75 per
cent of foreign direct investment in developing countries remains
concentrated in only 10 nations. In the many developing countries that are
still unable to attract substantial foreign capital, IFC plays a vital role
as a 'gateway' for the private investment crucial to fledgling private
sectors. More than half our projects involve international commercial
lenders for which IFC's presence is a critical factor in their decision to
lend.
IFC has been investing in developing countries since 1956. While we cannot
claim all of the credit for the good things that have happened in the
developing world in recent years, we do feel that we have made some
significant contributions. We are in it for the long haul, and look forward
to working with governments and investors in continuing to promote
investment in the developing world.
By the way, we were flattered by your reference to IFC as the Starship
Enterprise of the developing world. We think Captain Kirk would agree that
it is not yet time to mothball the Enterprise.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Employers seem to glorify youth when
seeking staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr OSMAN STREATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your 'Survey of business locations in Europe' (September 27) you
published a thoughtful article by Eva Kaluzynska about how the ageing
population of Europe and the 'baby bust' or decline in the birth rate meant
that 'canny employers' should understand that their current emphasis on
youth was soon going to start damaging them.
However, recruitment advertisements on September 28 reveal the familiar
picture. 'Ideally aged 27-35', 'mid 20s to early 30s', 'individuals aged
23-35'. Scant evidence that employers have received the message from the
team leader of Eurostat's project on demography, quoted by Ms Kaluzynska,
that 'this will stop'.
This glorification of youth as the essential qualification becomes
particularly offputting when it is applied to jobs managing other people's
money. One pension fund apparently thinks that 10 years' experience is
adequate to be the person in charge of a Pounds 2bn pension fund. I am glad
to say that my pension fund is not with them. A private client stockbroker
is looking for candidates 'likely to be aged 22-26', and with a 'minimum of
two years' front office stockbroking experience', to discuss their
investments with clients. I am likewise relieved that they are not my
private client stockbrokers. Am I mad, or are they?

<TEXT>
The Labour conference in Blackpool next week will be dominated by the
party's new leader. The Conservative conference in Bournemouth, which
follows a week later, will show us how in thrall the Tory leader is to his
party. By noting to what degree those expectations are met we will have a
truer measure of the state of British politics than any opinion poll can
offer, however 'adjusted' the figures.
Labour's conclave will be an occasion for revering the memory of the late Mr
John Smith, and an opportunity for advertising two propositions. The first
is that the people's party has cast aside the characteristics that have lost
it four successive elections since 1979; the second that Labour is possessed
of a coherent idea of the different brand of management it proposes to apply
to the market economy. The Tory assembly, which looks to be a dolorous
midterm affair, will serve the government best if it passes us quietly by.
The party will damage itself if it offers any new nostrums, like, say, 'back
to basics'.
When we recall, briefly for it is painful, the recent meeting of the Liberal
Democrats in Brighton, we can see how well-placed the people's party is. Mr
Paddy Ashdown, the Lib Dem leader, expressed a longing to serve Labour in
any capacity with which it might graciously choose to honour him. Mr Tony
Blair, Labour's leader, can only have concluded that when the time comes he
will have Paddy for breakfast. Meanwhile, Mr Blair need not show his teeth
other than in smiles. The Lib Dem disarray has simplified his task for next
week, which is to project himself as the undisputed leader of all
non-Conservative voters.
Nothing could be easier. The picnic lies before him. Who is there to upset
it? Aneurin Bevan is long dead, his ghost banished. Labour nearly fell apart
at Blackpool in 1959, when Mr Hugh Gaitskell, then leader, sought to
persuade a special conference to embrace the mixed economy. Mr Bevan, then
deputy leader, loyally demurred. 'The problem is one of education, not of
surrender]' he said, in what turned out to be his last speech, the text of
which is to be found in Mr Michael Foot's biography. 'This so-called
affluent society is an ugly society,' the great socialist orator went on.
'It is a vulgar society. It is a meretricious society. It is a society in
which priorities have gone all wrong . . .'
Later, in an article for the leftwing paper, Tribune, he talked of the
division between 'fundamentalists' and 'pragmatists'. Today the latter are
termed 'modernisers'; as to the former, they took the view, Mr Bevan wrote,
that if the Labour party was to abandon its main thesis of public ownership,
the only conflict with the Tories would be 'about nuances, about semitones
and half-tints . . .' He could not be faulted for that. The triumph of
socialism, which he regarded as inevitable, did not come to pass. The
triumph of capitalism will be celebrated under the Labour banner, in that
same Blackpool in which Mr Bevan thundered 35 years ago.
Mr Blair may use contemporary language, referring to renewal, community, the
connection between strong social support and the strength of individuals and
the like. He will doubtless remain true to the ethical foundations of his
beliefs. The meretricious elements of free-for-all capitalism will rightly
be rejected. But set against the exchange of ideological passions during
most of this century, what Labour has to offer next week can only be better
nuances, more attractive semitones, more appealing half-tints.
Thus constrained, it could be difficult for Mr Blair, who was six years old
when Bevan delivered that speech, to arouse the sense of idealism that
motivated young Labour activists during the glory days. Social and economic
changes have made it doubly difficult. In No Turning Back, a report* by Ms
Helen Wilkinson, 29, it is suggested that people aged between 18 and 34 are
driven by values starkly different from those that move the older
generation. The young are not 'sustenance-driven', which I think means they
are at ease in the welfare state, are content when hopping from job to
training to job, and comfortable with part-time employment. They take
equality between men and women for granted. They seek excitement. This is a
picture of optimistic youth, partly based on market research abstractions
that Mr Ashdown was wont to quote some years ago.
Some of it, such as the remarkable finding that the young are interested in
sex, will bring a nostalgic smile to the faces of those of us who will never
see 34 again except on a door. The central perception, which is that today's
young women are better educated, less obsessed than were their grandmothers
with marriage and childbearing, determined to work, self-motivated, and
assertive is if not exactly brand new, helpfully expressed. With the
changing roles of the genders on their minds, it is not surprising that many
of them are cool about traditional party politics.
Mr John Major, 51, is unlikely to enthuse them. When the prime minister
addresses the Conservative conference a fortnight from today, he will
presumably boast of his government's performance. He can hardly trumpet the
record on crime, with the home secretary tied in knots. He should give
honourable mention to his new education secretary, an excellent choice, and
his chancellor. The Tories are presiding over a period of growth and low
inflation. The part played in achieving that miracle by the ejection of
sterling from the exchange rate mechanism of the European monetary system
will not be stressed. Mr Major always promises lower taxes, but may not
dwell on who increased taxation in the first place.
He should seek to allay the anxieties of an electorate that has endured a
long recession and lost confidence in the durability of any job. He could,
with justification, point proudly to his role in establishing peace in
Northern Ireland. He usually wraps himself in the Union Jack, and may be
expected to sound a trifle more anti-European than the last time he
ratcheted towards the sceptics. He will have done well if a speech like that
crowns a conference in which gaffes are kept to a minimum, ministers refrain
from making coded attacks on their colleagues, and delegates are sent home
whistling Dixie.

<TEXT>
Sir, The trouble with the chancellor Kenneth Clarke's otherwise excellent
proposal to use International Monetary Fund gold to reduce third-world debt
is that it leaves damaging structural adjustment programmes (SAPs) intact
('Clarke proposes IMF gold sale to help poor nations', September 26). Nor
may sales of 10 per cent of the IMF's gold be quite enough.
At least the chancellor's proposal is a recognition that multilateral debt,
owed to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, is itself a
problem. But his initiative requires an expansion of the enhanced structural
adjustment facility (ESAF).
The experience of Christian Aid and other agencies is that structural
adjustment (promoted by ESAF) is damaging the poorest people in
debt-burdened developing countries. Not for nothing are SAPs said to stand
for 'Suffering African People'. For the poor, SAPs mean cuts in spending on
schools, health centres and on government jobs. Currency devaluation forces
up the prices of everything from imported medicines to bus fares, which
depend on imported fuel.
Ten per cent of the IMF's gold will be needed to wipe out the debts to the
IMF of Africa alone. If the price of reducing debts is even more structural
adjustment, it may be a price the poor are unable to pay.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Arts: The maestro of Oslo - Andrew Clark discusses the
burgeoning talent of Mariss Jansons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You would never have known that most of those taking part in last weekend's
performances of Gurrelieder at the Oslo Concert Hall were playing it for the
first time. But that is entirely characteristic of the Oslo Philharmonic
Orchestra and its chief conductor, Mariss Jansons. They are always setting
new challenges, and meeting them in bracing style.
Schoenberg's spectacular cantata, with its sumptuous sonorities and
Scandinavian legends, was an appropriate work with which to celebrate the
orchestra's 75th anniversary. Despite an underpowered men's chorus and a
tricky acoustic, the performance combined momentum, depth and splendour. The
soloists - including Jane Eaglen, Ben Heppner, Anne Sofie von Otter and, as
the Narrator, Klaus Maria Brandauer - could hardly have been bettered. At an
anniversary dinner the next day, the players' spokeswoman, Elisabeth
Sonstevold, gave a hard-hitting speech to the effect that, despite coming
from little Norway, with its scant recognition of musical achievement, the
Oslo Philharmonic had won worldwide acclaim.
This was reason enough to celebrate. But anniversaries are also a time for
stock-taking. Hovering over the festivities were two questions which have
increasingly preoccupied the musicians and their admirers in recent months.
How long can Mariss Jansons afford to stay in Oslo? And how much longer can
the Oslo Philharmonic hold on to him?
Jansons' qualities are such that he has an open invitation to guest-conduct
the world's leading orchestras, some of which - notably the London
Philharmonic and the Philharmonia - are looking for a new chief conductor.
Many in the music business feel it is time Jansons loosened his links with
Oslo and moved on. They say that however good the Oslo Philharmonic becomes,
it will never rank in status with heavyweight orchestras in London, Berlin
and the US. 'Oslo will always seem provincial by comparison,' said one
record company executive attending the anniversary celebrations. But
Jansons' modesty and dedication, together with his loyalty to Oslo, prevent
him taking the quick route to the top.
Jansons' love affair with the Oslo Philharmonic is the stuff of fairy tales.
When the two joined forces in 1979, both were relatively unknown.
Latvian-born but Russian by nationality, Jansons was still in the shadow of
his mentor, the great St Petersburg conductor Yevgeny Mravinsky. He needed
to broaden his repertoire and find an orchestra of his own. The Oslo
Philharmonic offered the ideal opportunity - one to which Jansons' Soviet
masters could hardly object. It was a mediocre orchestra, in a country on
the musical fringe of Europe.
Today, Jansons and the Oslo Philharmonic are part of the world's musical
elite. Their tours and recordings are eagerly anticipated, as much by the
wider concert-going public as by cognoscenti. Thanks largely to Jansons'
tutelage, the orchestra has become renowned for its clean sound, its lyrical
intensity and youthful exuberance. Although 15 years is a long relationship
by current musical standards, neither side shows any sign of tiring of each
other. But both have begun to ponder their future.
Jansons finds himself in much the same position as Simon Rattle in
Birmingham: the pressures to move elsewhere are great. He knows that sooner
or later, the time will come when he and the Oslo Philharmonic have
exhausted the possibilities for mutual development. The lure of taking
charge of a crack orchestra in one of the world's musical capitals is bound
to assert itself. Such a move would serve the strategic interests of the two
music-industry giants who coordinate his work, EMI Classics and the IMG
artist agency. Jansons' dilemma is that he may never be able to repeat the
conditions and chemistry he enjoys in Oslo.
For their part, the Oslo musicians are afraid they will lose their cachet on
the world stage if Jansons leaves. He is feted no matter which orchestra he
conducts, but the Oslo Philharmonic has yet to develop an independent
reputation. Its lucrative EMI contract, which runs till 1997, is linked
exclusively to Jansons. The orchestra knows that although Jansons will
always retain some form of link with Oslo, it cannot hold on to such a
talent for ever. It has begun to adjust its sights accordingly. A UK tour
with Paavo Berglund next autumn will test its independent appeal. It has
also begun to take a longer look at its guest conductors.
For the time being, Oslo can rest assured that there is no other chief
conductor's post available which would appeal to Jansons. The Royal
Concertgebouw, for example, has just signed a new contract with Riccardo
Chailly. Philadelphia, with its strong EMI connection, is the most likely
American orchestra, but Wolfgang Sawallisch is still only settling in there
 -and extended periods in the US would probably be too much of a culture
shock for a low-key personality like Jansons.
A full-time return to the St Petersburg Philharmonic is equally unlikely -
even if Yuri Temirkanov resigned - because the orchestra is beset by
financial problems, and the last thing Jansons wants is to be typecast as
Russian. It is no secret that the LSO is the London orchestra he most
admires, not just for its consistently high playing quality, but because it
has a sharper identity, a stronger management and sounder financial base
than its competitors. But the LSO has signed up Colin Davis. Jansons' work
in London for the foreseeable future will be with the LPO.
A grandfather at 51 but still remarkably boyish-looking, Jansons contradicts
the image of the modern maestro: his prime concern is neither money nor
power, but simply to continue developing as a musician. 'Once Mariss decides
on something, he's totally committed,' says Trond Okkelmo, the Oslo
Philharmonic's manager. 'He can travel the world, but he always wants to
come back to Oslo. He feels safe here, he knows he's loved. It gives him
room to experiment and be adventurous.'
There are other reasons why Jansons has stayed - chief among them the Oslo
Philharmonic's capacity for hard work and devotion to self-improvement. It
also has the immeasurable advantages of a committed management, a full
subscription audience and a strong touring programme. In November and
December it accompanies Jansons to the US. Next summer they revisit the
Salzburg Festival and the London Proms, followed by Japan in the autumn. In
1997 they will undertake a residency at the Vienna Musikverein, a rare
accolade for a foreign orchestra.
Thanks to its continually expanding horizons, the Oslo Philharmonic has
developed a reputation beyond the Russian and Scandinavian repertoire with
which it initially made its name. Today, tour audiences are just as likely
to hear Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner and Mahler. Jansons also wants to
develop its skills in the classical repertoire: there is talk of splitting
the orchestra into two for short periods to focus on Haydn and Mozart. All
this still leaves him plenty of scope to pursue outside interests. Having
neglected opera since his youth, he will conduct Carmen next year at the
Kirov in St Petersburg (with Olga Borodina), and La boheme for Welsh
National Opera in 1996.
What lies beyond 1997 is anyone's guess. Jansons himself insists he will not
calculate his next step. 'I will wait for what life brings. If I am to move
to a 'great orchestra', I must be sure it gives me the same joy as I have in
Oslo. If your sole motive is to make your name bigger, you're choosing it
only for the sake of career. What is the price? Should you give up artistic
satisfaction and joy just to be in a big city? That is a question I would
raise, without giving an answer. Each must choose. I have my own orchestra,
and great joy. I am lucky to conduct other good orchestras. I have what I
need.'

FT  30 SEP 94 / Arts: The Caribbean comes to theatre-land
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royalty has been over-thrown. London's most desolate theatre has been
transformed into the Island. More than that it is a Caribbean Wonderland.
The place is stiff with atmosphere, from the charming staff and a tableau of
old timers playing dominoes on the stairs, to the spicy snacks, rum
cocktails and ethnic market.
This is one theatre where you are positively encouraged to dawdle and make a
night of it. Stoll-Moss, owners of the old Royalty, have thrown everything,
including over Pounds 500,000 of real money, in an attempt to prove that
just because it is sited east of Holborn, in the favourite haunt of
vagabonds and bag ladies, the Island can still be a success.
Of course all the name changes and trimmings would be futile if the Island
does not produce a hit, and with Once in this Island it reckons that it has
got a banker.
The connection between the two is everywhere; indeed half the auditorium is
consumed by the set, with a tropical trellis creeping towards the circle. By
the time you take your seat, with its bright new white covering, you are in
the mood for yet another 'feel-good' show.
And that is exactly what you get. Once in this Island is a musical set in
the Caribbean, which has been a huge success on Broadway. A fine balance is
maintained between carefree escapism and social comment. Sure, there are
plenty of happy black peasants lauding the simple life and their affinity
with the gods, singing their hearts out and shaking their beefy bits.
But this cliche is subverted by the plot, an embroidery on Hans Christian
Anderson's The Little Mermaid, with the young girl offering her life to the
underworld in place of the man she loves. There is also some topical tension
in that the island seems to be Haiti, divided between poor villagers, who
provide the heroine Ti Moune, and rich mulatto Beauxhommes, who spawn her
faithless lover, Armand.
Lynn Ahrens wrote the book and lyrics and Stephen Flaherty conjures up music
which borrows heavily from Caribbean rhythms. You hardly leave the theatre
singing but it all fits wonderfully as a piece. Director David Toguri has
concentrated the action into 90 minutes without interval, which builds to a
compelling intensity, with the set contributing some exciting storms.
The cast play so well as an ensemble that individuals lose out, but Lorna
Brown is enchanting as the orphan Ti Moune and Clive Rowe makes a character
out of her adoptive dad. The fairy tale ending is affecting, and you would
have to be a sad old curmudgeon not to leave Once in this Island without a
warm glow.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Arts: The Constant Wife - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Somerset Maugham's The Constant Wife had an unfortunate first night in
London in 1927. The theatre management messed up the ticket sales, put the
rope barrier separating the the pit from the stalls in the wrong place and,
as the curtain was about to go up, the audience was quarrelling loudly about
who should be sitting where. The house manager was obliged to appeal for
calm.
That may have unnerved the players, including Fay Compton in the wonderful
part of Constance. At the end she thanked the 'civil members' of the
audience for their behaviour, only to be greeted by cat-calls.
It may also have unnerved the critics. The play was not well received and
ran for only 70 performances. Earlier it had fared much better in the US.
Constance was Ethel Barrymore, an actress with a tendency to forget her
lines. 'Darling,' she told Maugham after the first night, 'I've ruined your
play, but don't worry, it'll run for two years.' She wasn't far out.
So it is good to have a British revival now. Constance, here played by Fiona
Fullerton, remains as sparkling a part as ever, though perhaps less
surprising in the 1990s.
Happily enough married to a high-earning Harley Street surgeon who has a
girl-friend on the side, Constance (constant to what and to whom?) realises
that a woman, too, can break bounds provided that she has economic freedom.
Thus she goes into interior decorating with a female business friend and
makes money on her own. The demonstration of financial independence and the
fact that a woman can behave just like a man stuns her husband.
Some writers about Maugham say that this was very radical at the time and
too much for an English audience to accept. I wonder. Feminist independence,
toughness and wit had already surfaced in the plays of Shaw, Granville
Barker and Githa Sowerby, let alone Shakespeare.
The particular distinction of The Constant Wife lies in its ambiguity. The
play suggests that there was a turning point when women could go into
business. Constance was not unduly out of sorts with a husband whom she knew
to be errant, even when her family thought that she was ignorant. She knew
that she was provided for and had a good lawyer in the event of a mishap.
She may have gone into business, and into an affair with an old admirer,
just to teach her husband a lesson. At the end we are not quite sure whether
she will come back to her husband or whether the husband will learn the
lesson. The answer to the first question is probably yes; the answer to the
second is doubtful. Indeed one of the delights of the piece is that
practically every line is full of irony and double meaning.
After a slowish start, Ms Fullerton plays Constance with mounting dominance.
She catches both the period nature of the play and its modernity.
There are other stars. Terence Wilton as the surgeon shows how boorishly
insensitive an otherwise accomplished Englishman can be. Nigel Davenport has
a marvellous bit part as the injured, not quite pukka husband who makes his
money in the City. Sheila Allen plays the mother with the deliberate
recognition that in the mid-1920s you could not have quite the authority of
Lady Bracknell.
It is not a perfect play, but it is immensely worth seeing. Directed by
Peter James under the banner of Pericles Productions, it is at Richmond this
week before moving on to Barnstaple, Canterbury and other venues. At
Richmond there is a novel piece of sponsorship. The Petersham Hotel is
sponsoring the entire Richmond autumn season and the theatre has picked up
matching funds from the government's Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme.

Scientists and technicians working for the British Antarctic Survey will
spend the winter in the first mobile house on skis.
The building will house 30 people studying ice, the upper atmosphere and the
climate at the Halley Research Station, the BAS's most remote Antarctic
base. Every year, the ski-borne house will be moved by bulldozers to pull it
free of snow and ice. The skis, which are 19.5m long, are fitted with air
bags which are blown up to crack any ice that accumulates underneath them.
The pre-fabricated house, which was built by VM Fabrications,
Huddersfield-based engineers and Bennett Associates, designers, will replace
tent-style accommodation.

Electronic databases can usually retrieve either pictures or text but not
both. Although scanned representations of pages can be stored by databases,
they cannot be manipulated.
Cascade Systems, an Ipswich-based software company, has overcome this
problem in an electronic library system that allows users to work with whole
pages of text and pictures which are presented in the same layout with which
they were published.
The Cascade system also allows users to extract information from the
database using a request couched in ordinary language, rather than by
requesting specific keywords. It depends on a probabilistic search
mechanism, which works by weighting each word in the request according to
its frequency in the database.

<TEXT>
A natural method of contraception, which depends on monitoring hormone
levels, has been developed by Unipath, a diagnostic kit manufacturer.
The kit uses a urine test to track the level of luteinising hormone and
estrone-3-glucuronide. It is used with a hand-held monitor, which calculates
a woman's fertile period using information about her menstrual cycle.
Early trials indicate 98 per cent effectiveness, which is roughly equivalent
to barrier methods of contraception. The product is expected to be launched
at the end of next year.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Technology: Defence against an alien attack - A look at
medicine based on the immune system in the latest of a series on drug
discoveries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Medical magic bullets come and go. From cancer cures to obesity treatments,
precisely targeted drugs regularly show early promise which fades during
clinical trials. Medicine based on the immune system aims to be different.
It uses the natural mechanisms that can defend the human body against almost
any microscopic invader. The promise is that, while drug companies spend
billions of pounds developing synthetic chemicals to fight disease, the
body's defensive arsenal is in place waiting to do the job. The right
trigger could release a new generation of successful treatments.
The idea is one of the oldest in medicine. In 1796, Edward Jenner conferred
immunity against smallpox by infecting healthy people with a milder disease
called cowpox. In effect, he taught the immune system how to tackle an enemy
it had not yet encountered. Since then, vaccination has all but eradicated
former killers such as tuberculosis, typhoid and cholera.
New vaccines continue to be developed. SmithKline Beecham's Havrix for
hepatitis A is today's world best seller with revenues of about Dollars 500m
(Pounds 330m) a year.
As well as being boosted, the immune system can be suppressed. For 30 years
this has helped transplant patients receive donated organs which would
normally be rejected.
With the power of immune system manipulation already demonstrated,
researchers promise more to come. The body's natural defences could be
directed to kill cancer cells or the Aids virus HIV. Diseases in which the
defence mechanisms have gone wrong, such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid
arthritis and psoriasis, could one day be brought under control.
Unfortunately, the immune system is resistant to exploitation because of its
staggering complexity. It has virtually uncountable numbers of mechanisms
and components. Those discovered so far are grouped into categories with
names such as scavenger cells, natural killer cells, eosinophils, T-cells,
B-cells and immunoglobulins. Each can work in small numbers or be mass
produced, function independently or together, influencing each other in the
war against invaders.
Ian Hutchinson, professor of immunology at Manchester University, points out
that there are 100,000bn different kinds of T-cell alone. Each one is
pre-formed in the body and designed to attack a different invader. It is as
if every man, woman and child were a crack shot with 20m types of firearm,
each distinct from the next and each capable of killing just one kind of
attacker. If an alien invader landed, a search would have to be mounted for
the one gun that was effective. It would have to be mass produced and
shipped to the landing site.
Progress in the medical version of firearm production has been slow. Some
individual components of the immune system have been isolated, but this is a
long way from finding the right one to cure a disease.
David Barry, director of research and development at UK drug company
Wellcome, says: 'There are literally hundreds of molecules that are said to
stimulate the immune system. In theory, and sometimes in animal models, they
work. In real life diseases, it is very difficult to prove anything.'
He says that biology has not yet analysed the fine detail of how immunity
works. For example, Aids patients, whose immune systems have been damaged,
tend to suffer from some types of cancer and not others. Yet the exact
relationship between cancer and the immune system remains unclear.
However, plenty of work is going on that could lead to new therapies within
two or three years. Cancer is frequently the target, largely for the
commercial reason that effective therapies are not yet available. The immune
system could be harnessed in the fight against cancer if only cancer cells
could be distinguished better from normal cells.
The work of New York biotechnology company Imclone Systems is typical. It
has a drug called Vaccine 105AD7 which mimics a material on the surface of
colon cancer cells in a way that triggers production of large numbers of
killer cells able to attack the cancer. Clinical trial results published in
April showed that patients receiving the drug survived for 12 months,
compared with an average of three months for those not receiving it.
Cancer vaccines are being developed by several biotechnology companies.
Products from Therion Biologics of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Somatix of
Alameda, California, are already in clinical trials.
Other companies are trying to use the power of immune system cells to bind
to specific targets such as cancer cells to carry poisons directly to
targets. But all of these products are still at a relatively early stage of
development.
Closer to the market are the latest advances in suppressing, rather than
stimulating, the immune system. The idea is not new. Earlier this century,
doctors noticed that children with measles sometimes suffered a recurrence
of tuberculosis. Measles had depressed the immune system enough for dormant
TB bacteria to become active.
Similar immune suppression was observed in the 1960s as a side effect of
potential cancer drugs. The first proper immunosuppressive drug, launched in
1964, was Wellcome's Imuran, a failed cancer therapy.
Immune suppression is now big business. There are almost 3,000 organ
transplants a year in the UK alone, mostly of kidneys. Transplant patients
take immunosuppressants for the rest of their lives.
The most widely used drug is Sandimmun from Switzerland's Sandoz. It had
sales of almost Dollars 1bn in 1993, making it about the world's 30th best
selling drug.
Compared with immunostimulants, Sandimmun is not very specific. This is just
as well because a transplanted organ stimulates the production of up to
1,000bn different kinds of T-cells. Sandimmun is poisonous, limiting the
dosage, and it depresses too much of the immune system. Patients have to be
given antibiotics to prevent infection.
There are several drugs, which promise fewer side effects, being launched or
close to the market. FK-506 from the Japanese company Fujisawa has over the
past year received approval from many countries to go on sale. The price of
about Dollars 12,000 for the first year's supply has not stopped it winning
sales from Sandimmun.
In theory, immune suppression should be able to help in conditions where the
immune system is over active. In the case of multiple sclerosis, parts of
nerve cells are mistaken for invaders and attacked. In rheumatoid arthritis
material in the joints is damaged. Even allergy is thought to result from an
over-enthusiastic immune response.
Here the goal is to understand the mechanism of action and block it. Several
biotechnology companies are close to marketing treatments.
Immulogic of Massachusetts has developed a way to immobilise the T-cells
that respond to cat fur and trigger cat allergy in millions of people. This
spring, clinical trials indicated the company's lead product, Allervax Cat,
reduced allergic symptoms in 70 per cent of patients.
Drugs for MS and rheumatoid arthritis are proving harder to find. Earlier
this month Wellcome abandoned research on its drug Campath 1-H, which once
promised to be a breakthrough in RA.
Such failures are commonplace in immune system drug research. The field is
vast and the interlinking of biochemical processes so complex that some
promising routes will inevitably prove to be blind alleys. But the immune
system is pervasive and on a good day so effective that immunology is likely
to prove a popular area for drug research for many years to come.
The series continues next month with a look at drugs for coughs and colds.
Articles over the last six months have looked at pharmaceutical
advances in the following areas:
Fungi                  25 August
Stroke                   29 July
Painkillers              30 June

FT  30 SEP 94 / People: Earl Peel to be adviser on Duchy of Cornwall
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Earl Peel, 46, the great-great-grandson of Sir Robert the founder of
Britain's police force, is to take over from Lord Ashburton, chairman of BP,
as Lord Warden of the Stanneries, an ancient title which means that he will
be the senior adviser to the Prince of Wales in running the Duchy of
Cornwall.
The Duchy, a mainly agricultural estate of 130,000 acres spread across 23
counties, was set up in 1337 to provide an income for the British heir to
the throne. Its activities range from letting farms, to conservation, inner
city regeneration and organic farming. Last year the Duchy increased its
surplus by 20 per cent to Pounds 4m and its capital grew by 15 per cent to
Pounds 87.7m.
The Prince of Wales, as chairman of The Prince's Council which advises on
the running of the estate, operates it in accordance with his own strongly
held environmental and social principles. Lord Peel, vice chairman of the
Game Conservancy and a close friend of the Prince, is in the process of
selling his family's 26,485 acre Gunnerside estate in North Yorkshire. He is
well regarded for having transformed one of Britain's most run down estates
into a fine grouse moor.
Lord Peel only joined the Prince's Council last year and has a very
different business background to that of Lord Ashburton, a member of the
Barings banking family. Lord Ashburton, had acted as the Receiver General -
the Duchy's financial adviser - for seventeen years before taking over as
Lord Warden in 1990. Lord Cairns, chief executive of S G Warburg, took over
as the Receiver General and continues to hold that post.
Lord Peel takes up his new part-time post on November 1. Meanwhile, Jeremy
Sullivan, 49, a lawyer with particular interest in architectural and
planning matters, is taking over as the Attorney General to the Prince of
Wales. He succeeds Robert Carnwath, 49, who has been appointed a High Court
judge. James Furber, 40, who joined Farrer &amp; Co in 1976, has been appointed
solicitor to the Duchy succeeding Henry Boyd-Carpenter, 54, another Farrer's
solicitor, who is taking over from Sir Matthew Farrer as the private
solicitor to the Queen.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Property: Independent Property Databank monthly index
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The return on the Independent Property Databank monthly index continues to
decelerate, recording 0.6 per cent in August.
Both rental and capital value growth have shown signs of changes in
direction over the month, with the rental value index displaying a
negligible increase from 136.44 in July to 136.45 in August. Capital values
fell by 0.02 per cent, the first decline in values since May 1993. Yields
remain firm with the initial and equivalent yields holding at 7.8 per cent
and 8.1 per cent respectively for the third consecutive month.
For the calender year to date, the all-property rate of return stands at
13.5 per cent, just over half the 24.8 per cent recorded for the year to
August. Due to the recent stability of valuation yields, longer-term rates
of capital growth continue to slow, recording 14.9 per cent for the year to
August compared with 15.3 per cent for the year to July.
Industrials and retails continue to switch positions as best-performing
sector; industrials regained the lead with a return of 0.8 per cent in
August, followed by retails at 0.7 per cent. Offices returned 0.4 per cent
and continued to lag behind. In the longer term, the sectors' relative
positions remain unchanged with retails returning 26.1 per cent for the year
to August, followed by industrials with 25.5 per cent and offices with 22.3
per cent.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Property: The worst of all worlds - Property cannot escape
the pull of bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest monthly bulletin from the Investment Property Databank contains
good news and bad news, but not in equal measure.
The fractional increase in all-property rental values - the first since 1990
 -provides some cheer. But more evidence of rental growth will be required
if property prices are to resume their upward march. After 14 months of
rising capital values, the all-property index has registered a tiny decline.
The fall in capital values will not come as a shock to those at the coalface
of the property market. Less inclusive indices than that produced by IPD
suggest that capital values stalled in early summer.
Surveyor Richard Ellis's index, based on properties totalling Pounds 1bn
managed by the firm, showed capital values running out of steam as early as
May.
Yet a fall in the more broadly-based IPD monthly index adds weight to the
argument that the market is facing a widespread downswing rather than
isolated local problems.
How long this correction lasts probably depends on events in other financial
markets. Thanks to the overhang of over-rented properties, the gravitational
pull of gilts is especially strong.
IPD data suggests that about 44 per cent of all commercial property is
currently over-rented. The problem is worse than in previous cycles because
nominal rents have fallen so far since the peak in 1990. Even in the dark
days of the 1970s, nominal rents in retail and industrial property continued
to rise thanks to high inflation.
The City of London is the worst afflicted, where 57 per cent of tenants are
paying rents above market levels. The degree of over-renting is also
greatest in the City. Average rents paid by tenants are more than 50 per
cent above levels now being achieved.
On these figures, owners of many over-rented buildings can not expect to see
income growth from their investment until the end of the decade. In the
meantime they have to be content with a fixed income, which makes
over-rented property something akin to a corporate bond.
Just like a corporate bond, over-rented buildings are priced at yield
premium to gilts - to reflect the risk that the tenant will go bust, and the
relative lack of liquidity. When gilt prices fall, over-rented property is
sure to follow.
Moreover, the lag between bond yields starting to rise and property values
falling - between four and six months depending on which property index is
taken as evidence - suggests that the last quarter of the year could take
the edge off returns achieved so far.
For property to escape the pull of the bond market, investors have to
believe that buildings are something more than fixed-income assets. The
latest IPD data on rental values therefore points the way ahead.
Again, anecdotal evidence from the market started to show the early signs of
rental recovery some time ago. Recent London lettings suggest that rents are
already rising - or, at least, incentives are falling - for better-quality
office space.
Brixton Estate accompanied its interim results this week with a comment that
demand for industrial space, in particular, had picked up since the end of
the summer.
If the pattern of previous cycles is repeated, rents will surely respond
across the market before long.
'If the economy continues to grow as it is now, we should have an
established pattern of rental growth by this time next year,' said Mr Angus
McIntosh, head of research consultancy at Richard Ellis. In the same vein,
surveyor Jones Lang Wootton is forecasting 5 per cent rental growth for 1995
and 1996.
The lingering worry is that after five years of scaling down, companies are
likely to consume less space even during recovery. They will also be more
demanding about the kind of space they occupy.
Big, old office blocks are likely to remain empty or find tenants only at
rents which landlords find bitterly disappointing.
Moreover, there is no reason why property should be immune from the
deflationary pressures elsewhere in the economy. Companies which are having
their margins squeezed in industrial and consumer markets will be loathe to
pay more than strictly necessary for space.
These are good reasons to believe that rental growth will be subdued for
some months yet, and that the bond market will continue to be a decisive
influence. Of course, it is possible that the bond yields will fall through
the rest of this year and next as investors come to realise that fears about
inflation are overdone. Alternatively, bond market investors could be proved
right by a resurgence of inflation, which would help solve the problem of
over-renting.
For the moment, though, the market will have to live with the worst of all
possible worlds: rising bond yields and no sign of inflationary growth.

FT  30 SEP 94 / People: Hodkinson in surprise move
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jim Hodkinson is making a surprise return to the Kingfisher retailing group
to head its do-it-yourself business B&amp;Q, only two months after leaving the
company for Home Depot, the US DIY giant.
This time he moves on to an expanded main board, as does Philippe Frances.
Frances had run Darty, the French company acquired by Kingfisher last year,
and is now chief executive of the entire electrical retailing sector,
including both Comet and Darty.
Hodkinson, 50, was taken on by Home Depot in July as a consultant to examine
expansion opportunities for the US group in Europe.
'This is a remarkable move,' commented on City analyst. 'How many other FTSE
companies have lost an executive in July and reappointed him as a board
director in September?'
Kingfisher said that after an extensive search for a new head for its DIY
business, it had concluded Hodkinson was the best man for the job. This
coincided with Hodkinson's decision to return to the UK from Home Depot's
base in Atlanta because he was unhappy about being separated from his wife
and children, who remained in Bournemouth.
Hodkinson joined B&amp;Q as a store manager in 1972, and became operations and
personnel director in the 1980s before becoming chief executive and deputy
chairman. He was responsible for launching the DIY price war of 1992, with a
series of promotional weekends offering huge savings. He moved on to the
post of director of international development in June 1992, amid apparent
disagreements between him and the chairman, Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, over
strategy.
His return to B&amp;Q suggests those differences have been patched up, and may
presage a renewed international push for B&amp;Q. However, the priority is
likely to be improving the performance of the UK operations in a difficult
market, and opening more of the large-format B&amp;Q Warehouse stores.
Kingfisher's said its appointment of Frances, 48, to the main board was a
further indication that it now sees itself as a 'Franco-British business'.
The two new directors will strengthen the depth of retail experience on a
board dominated by non-career retailers, analysts commented.
'We wanted to make sure the same emphasis was put on retail skills as on
strategic skills,' Kingfisher said.

FT  30 SEP 94 / People: Jackson to quit Field Group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Barry Jackson, 48, is quitting Field Group, the carton-maker which was
floated on the stock market a year ago, following a management
reorganisation which has brought in Chris Simpson, 44, to oversee part of
the business Jackson had been running.
The company says that Jackson, who has been with the group for five years
and ran its Thatcham plant, is leaving 'to pursue a broader challenge
elsewhere'. Simpson, an economist who has spent ten years in the packaging
industry, will be responsible for the collective performance of the group's
Newcastle and Thatcham factories. It is expected that he will be appointed
to the board. He has been given the new title of director designate of the
food and household division, Field's second biggest business.
Keith Gilchrist, Field's chief executive, describes Simpson's appointment as
an 'important step' in developing a 'market-led divisional structure which
can also maximise benefits of scale'. Simpson's packaging industry
experience includes stints with Elopak and Abbey Corrugated, part of the
David S. Smith Group.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Management: Calling all those budding writers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A challenge to budding essayists is issued today by the Financial Times and
the UK's Management Consultancies Association.
It comes in the form of a jointly sponsored award aimed at encouraging
managers and management consultants to write a stimulating, original and
non-technical essay on a subject of current business interest.
Inspired by the government's white paper in May, the chosen topic for this
year's competition is 'Competitiveness - the key to success'.
The winning essay, say the sponsors, 'will be the one that is judged to add
focus to the debate by suggesting means, structural and substantial rather
than tactical and cosmetic, by which organisations can ensure greater
competitiveness through appropriate management of operations'.
Entries, which have to be submitted by December 1, must be between 2,000 and
3,000 words and written in English.
The winning author will receive a Pounds 3,000 cash prize and, with other
suitable essays, his or her work will appear in a booklet to be published by
the MCA in early 1995. The winning article will be considered for
publication in the FT.
For conditions of entry and an entry form contact FT-MCA Management Essay
Award, c/o Management Consultancies Association, 11 West Halkin Street,
London SW1X 8JL.
 ------------------------
The MCA has announced the second year of its sponsorship of a prize to
recognise and reward writers of management books.
The main prize of Pounds 5,000 is open to British writers of all ages, while
a special commendation (worth up to Pounds 2,000) will be made to the best
entry written by an author under 35.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Management: Master minds - How the GMAT test has been
changed to give a better picture of would-be MBAs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE BICKERSTAFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In two weeks' time about 60,000 ambitious young people will sit down in
around 700 centres in more than 100 countries to take the same exam. The
results will gain little publicity and few people will be aware that such a
single international test is taking place. Yet the examination is a key part
of the quest for would-be MBAs (Masters of Business Administration).
The exam is the Graduate Management Admissions Test, or GMAT, the only
common international indicator of the quality of student applicants for MBA
programmes. All but a few leading schools, notably Harvard, require it. It
is increasingly controversial on several grounds - including whether some
applicants have been cheating.
GMAT-takers in October face a more than usually daunting prospect. For the
first time in a decade a significant change is being introduced to the test.
Candidates will have to write complex essays as well as answer the
traditional multiple-choice questions.
The GMAT is sponsored and directed by the Graduate Management Admissions
Council (GMAC), an influential association of over 100 leading American
business schools. Its administration is undertaken by the Educational
Testing Service in Princeton, New Jersey, in the USA. The test takes place
four times a year in January, March, June and October.
'The GMAT allows us to reduce 600 applicants for 80 places to manageable
proportions,' says Kamran Kashani, MBA programme director at IMO in
Lausanne, Switzerland.
Kashani believes it is a reliable predictor of academic success, especially
in the quantitative area. 'Those who don't do well on the 'quantitative'
part of the GMAT do seem to have trouble with subjects such as accounting
and finance,' he says.
'There is no doubt that the GMAT has validity.'
However, the test has come in for some criticism. A number of business
schools are refusing to quote average scores on the grounds that they are
'misleading'. Or they say the GMAT is an inadequate measurement in that it
does not provide a rounded picture of of a potential candidate.
Kathleen Kiehle Valentine is admissions director of the University of
Pittsburgh's Katz business school in the USA. She says that as business
schools in the US attempt to diversify their applicant pool and student
intake, it is no longer enough just to look at GMAT scores or academic
grades.
Bradford Management Centre, in the UK, runs its own tests for British
students, which it regards as a more accurate predictor than the GMAT. John
Sparkes, deputy director of the centre, says that 'the GMAT needs to be
re-invented. It is simply too easy for students to prepare and be coached to
succeed in it. I don't think that was the original intention.'
There is also some concern that in such a geographically dispersed test it
would appear to be relatively simple to have someone else take the test for
you. There is anecdotal evidence that this can happen in a related test used
by business schools and also administered from Princeton, the Test of
English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). Stories abound of students with good
TOEFL scores arriving on programmes with only minimal English.
Kashani accepts that there are examples of individuals who get others to
take the test for them. But he believes it is fairly rare and, like many
other academics, sees it as 'an acceptable risk'.
Bill Broesamle, president of GMAC, agrees that 'impersonation' is a
perennial problem but adds that there are many measures, including photo
identification, to gain entrance to the exam, to overcome it.
But Bradford's Sparkes warns of a potentially much more significant
drawback.
'There is little doubt that there is cultural bias in the GMAT,' he says.
'And that works to the particular disadvantage of the Japanese and other
nationals from the far east.'
The cultural bias of the GMAT is widely acknowledged. The test exists only
in English - and some say American English at that - and its multiple-choice
approach is strange to many cultures.
'There is a cultural bias but we take that into account,' says Kashani.
'We don't have a specific formula for discounting it but after a while you
get a knack of assessing it and getting it right.'
But because of these and other worries, the GMAT is being significantly
revised. In the test next month, for the first time candidates will face two
half-hour essay questions designed to test ability to analyse complex issues
and to argue a position.
Traditionally, the GMAT has aimed to measure understanding and reasoning
ability, both verbal and quantitative, through multiple choice questions.
The highly formal structure of GMAT has made preparation and coaching for
the undoubtedly tough test relatively straightforward.
Although the new-style GMAT retains the multiple-choice sections, both GMAT
administrators and schools hope that the introduction of essay questions,
which will be difficult to prepare in advance, will give a much truer
picture of candidates.
'Business schools and employers have asked us to include this type of essay
question,' says GMAC president Broesamle.
'They are interested in students' ability to address complex issues in
writing. This isn't just a test of writing skills. It's testing thinking
ability in a different format.'
Schools will continue to receive the traditional GMAT score but will also
get a separate essay mark and copies of the essays.
'The essay questions should help us a lot,' says the Katz school's
admissions chief Valentine. 'They will be a great improvement to the GMAT.'
The EFMD (European Foundation for Management Development) welcomes the new
essay questions particularly because they should allow non-American students
to demonstrate their abilities better.
Many academics believe the GMAT may be 10 years late in introducing essay
questions, welcome though they are.
But the belief that they will overcome the problems of excessive preparation
and coaching for the GMAT may be short-lived.
GMAC's Broesamle comments that the institutions that provide such training
are already gearing up to coach students in writing GMAT-style essays.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Management: Are you the uncertain type? - Adrian Furnham
seeks to identify those intolerant of ambiguity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FURNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is well known that we can be sure of only two things: death and taxes.
For the rest of life, the future is uncertain. Economic and political
predictions are ambiguous, mutually contradictory and frequently gloomy.
But it is not only the future that is unclear. All sorts of things in our
daily lives are uncertain and ambiguous: people's motives, competitor
strategies, the cause of certain illnesses.
There are those who seek out ambiguity. They like abstract art, poetry with
multiple meaning, wandering in unfamiliar countries. And there are those who
are made fearful and angry by it. They need order, clarity, structure and
strict demarcations between right and wrong.
A person with a low tolerance of ambiguity experiences stress, reacts
prematurely and avoids ambiguous stimuli, be they in art, literature,
politics or emotional experience. Those who dislike change can be seriously
out of kilter with the modern world. As companies become global and
multinational in terms of location, work-force and customers, these people
tend to be rather xenophobic and nationalistic.
But before we condemn those uncomfortable with uncertainty to a 'four-legs
good, two-legs bad' world, why not evaluate yourself:
1 An expert who doesn't come up with a definite answer probably doesn't know
a great deal. True or false?
2 A good job is one where what is to be done and how it is done are clearly
specified. T/F.
3 In the long run it is possible to get more done by tackling small, simple
problems rather than larger, complicated ones. T/F.
4 A person who leads an even, regular life in which few surprises or
unexpected happenings arise has a lot to be grateful for. T/F.
5 I like parties where I know most of the people more than ones where all or
most are complete strangers. T/F.
6 The sooner we all acquire similar values and ideas the better. T/F.
7 People who schedule their lives all the time probably miss most of the joy
of living. T/F.
8 It is more fun to tackle a complicated problem than to solve a simple one.
T/F.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Bucks voters back unitary option
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Buckinghamshire residents have opted for unitary authorities, according to
the results of an advisory referendum published yesterday by the Local
Government Commission.
It found that creating four all-purpose unitary authorities was favoured by
45 per cent of respondents, compared with 27 per cent for the commission's
favourite option of three, and 19 per cent for giving unitary status to
Milton Keynes and keep the two-tier system of county and districts for the
rest of Buckinghamshire.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Proposal on public sector accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The leading professional accountancy body for public services yesterday
called for a new body to set accounting standards in the public sector, Jim
Kelly writes.
Mr Martin Evans, technical director of the Chartered Institute of Public
Finance and Accountancy, said the new board could bring together public and
private practice.
He told the Government Accounting Service conference at the University of
Surrey that the last decade had seen a shift away from cash-based
public-sector accounting towards a more commercial system. Change in the
public sector had been prompted by compulsory competitive tendering, the
development of the internal market in the National Health Service and the
Next Steps programme for the civil service.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Tight price curb on Scots power groups: Shares fall on
regulator's move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Share prices in the two Scottish electricity companies fell sharply
yesterday after Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator,
announced price controls which he said would save consumers Pounds 300m over
the three years from next April.
If accepted by the companies, the controls would mean a saving of Pounds 91
over three years to a family with a Pounds 400-a-year ScottishPower bill.
Scottish Hydro-Electric household customers would save Pounds 74 on average.
The controls were tougher than some analysts had predicted, with
Hydro-Electric judged by most to have come off worst. At the close yesterday
Hydro-Electric shares were down 45p at 327p while ScottishPower was down 31p
at 349p. The review contrasted with Prof Littlechild's recent review of the
English and Welsh electricity companies which were criticised as being too
lax - and prompted significant rises in share prices.
Direct comparison is difficult because the Scots companies are generators,
suppliers and distributors while the controls south of the border were
applied only to distribution.
In distribution, the one area where comparison is possible, the Scottish
companies appeared to have been treated less harshly. ScottishPower must cut
distribution prices by 2 per cent a year in real terms in the next five
years and Hydro-Electric by 1 per cent.
The English and Welsh companies were required to make cuts of between 11 per
cent and 17 per cent in the first year and 2 per cent thereafter. The Scots
had argued that they were entitled to better treatment because price
controls for the first year of privatisation were tougher on them than on
English and Welsh companies. Hydro-Electric had pressed to be able to
increase its distribution charges in real terms to compensate for a formula
which will require it and ScottishPower to lower their generation charges in
stages to match those in England and Wales by 1998-99.
Prof Littlechild also proposes to tighten controls on the companies' supply
businesses which buy and sell electricity. He wants reductions of 2 per cent
in real terms for three years until the market is opened up to full
competition.
ScottishPower said the review was broadly in line with expectations and
'would not alter our stated aim of sustainable real dividend growth of 5 per
cent to 6 per cent a year.' Mr Roger Young, Hydro-Electric chief executive,
said the review document was extremely complicated. The board would decide
on 'acceptance or otherwise'.
Some analysts downgraded dividend growth forecasts although most consider 5
per cent achievable for the rest of the decade.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Kent to woo French shoppers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kent retailers are launching a campaign to attract French shoppers to the
county in an attempt to compensate for the thousands of British shoppers
crossing the English Channel in search of cheap alcohol.
The Kent Chamber of Commerce, together with retailers including Boots, BHS,
Debenhams, Mothercare, Tesco and Texas, ferry company Sealink, and French
coach operators, is organising shopping day trips for the French, called
'Passeport pour Canterbury'.
Shoppers will be collected from their home town, taken to Calais and across
the Channel to Canterbury and Whitfield. Participating stores are offering a
special discount to holders of the 'passeport'. The trip will cost just
FFr99 (Pounds 12).
The campaign will be backed by three weeks of TV advertising, which began
yesterday, will be able to take 35,000 shoppers in the first month. If the
scheme is successful it will be repeated.
Mr Martin Graham, chief executive of Kent Chamber of Commerce, said that
while alcoholic drinks and cigarettes were cheaper in France owing to lower
duty levels, goods such as food, clothes and DIY goods were cheaper in the
UK.
Prices have become more competitive since the devaluation of sterling in
1992, and children's clothes are particularly cheap, as they are not subject
to VAT in the UK.
'French tourists don't come here with shopping in mind,' Mr Graham said. 'A
lot of people come because they want to see Canterbury. Now we have a chance
to communicate the advantages of shopping in Kent and make it as easy as
possible for French shoppers to give it a try.'
The budget for the project is only Pounds 20,000, but Mr Graham said if the
full 35,000 French shoppers were to take up the offer it could raise several
million pounds in trade.
'It is partly a question of hurt national pride as everyone was going the
other way to shop, but few were coming here,' he added.
Mr Graham said most of the thousands of British shoppers who crossed the
Channel each day on the so-called 'booze run' do not come from Kent, but
from further afield.
However, he said Kent businesses had not yet taken advantage of the
opportunities to attract French shoppers to the UK.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Three ministries keep Treasury axe at bay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland offices appear to have beaten off
attempts by Treasury officials to reduce their budgets in this year's public
expenditure round.
Amid signs that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will announce big cuts in
public spending in his November Budget, the Treasury is understood to have
conducted an intense examination of the spending programmes of each of the
three territorial departments.
But senior officials at the departments said this week that they expected
their grants would be upgraded in line with inflation and that few
individual programmes would be scaled back. 'We now know that our grant will
not be radically different,' said a Scottish Office official, confirming
that the department had strongly resisted changes to a basic formula by
which it receives an allocation which is a proportion of relevant spending
in England.
An official at the Northern Ireland Office also claimed that Mr Jonathan
Aitken, the chief secretary to the Treasury, was unlikely to press ahead
with cuts in the department's budget during delicate negotiations over a
political settlement in the province.
'We reckon that Jonathan Aitken is very astute, and would recognise the
problems if the Treasury goes in too strong here and cuts areas that are
politically sensitive,' he said.
In the annual public spending round, total provision for each of the three
territorial departments is adjusted in line with the size of comparable
programmes in England, such as education, housing and health.
The population of each territory is also taken into account. Last year,
Scotland received 10.66 per cent of England's grant, Wales 6.02 per cent and
Northern Ireland 2.87 per cent.
As in previous years, Treasury officials are understood to have called for
changes in these percentages, but appear to have failed. 'The formula
arrangements as they apply to Scotland will continue,' said one official,
adding that it would be prone to marginal adjustments because of population
change.
Officials at the Northern Ireland office said this week that the Treasury
had again tried to run all three departments on a straight per capita basis,
ignoring the special circumstances created by the security situation in
Ulster.
It is understood that the cost of maintaining Northern Ireland's prisons and
paying compensation to victims of terrorist attacks have been regularly
examined in talks between the department and the Treasury.

FT  30 SEP 94 / ScottishPower signs deal with Caledonian Paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ScottishPower has signed a Pounds 40m four-year deal to supply electricity
to Caledonian Paper, the papermaker based at Irvine in Ayrshire, James
Buxton writes.
The companies have signed a partnership agreement aimed at co-operating to
achieve a 'fault-free' supply of electricity to the plant, which produces
200,000 tonnes of paper a year for magazines.
Caledonian Paper, part of Kymmene of Finland, has complained about the
quality of its electricity supply. Interruptions to the supply can halt
production, costing up to Pounds 100,000 a day in lost output.
ScottishPower has indicated that it will be able to supply power to
Caledonian Paper if the plant expands, as expected, in a few years.

Standards Board and other bodies. He said the government should become
involved and nominated 17 contributors to its costs - including the Treasury
and regulators such as the Housing Corporation.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Clarke's 1.5% solution dissolving fast: Robert Taylor
explains why it is proving hard to keep deals below the government's target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first results of the New Earnings Survey suggest it is increasingly
difficult for any government to control or even influence the level of pay
settlements in the economy.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, loses no opportunity in driving home his
message that he intends to enforce a stiff public-sector pay curb of 1.5 per
cent for the next three years. But the labour market is not the same as it
was in the 1960s and 1970s when successive governments ran incomes policies
from the centre with at least some success in ensuring pay restraint.
The demise of much national wage bargaining in the private sector in recent
years and the government's active encouragement of decentralisation and
efficiency-related pay in the public sector has ensured that an increasing
amount of wage bargaining is carried out at local level which is more
sensitive to market pressures.
'The survey this year shows there is an enormous amount of wage drift in the
economy,' said Mr Chris Trinder, research director of the independent Public
Finance Foundation.
It also suggests that those in work have been able to more than hold their
own in the relative level of their pay as they have benefited from survival
in a more flexible and insecure labour market where companies have cut
staffing levels.
Holding the line in the public sector is therefore going to be difficult as
the economic recovery gathers pace. Incomes Data Services, the independent
analyst, in its forecasts for 1995 believes most deals in the private sector
will range from between 3 per cent to 4.5 per cent.
'Higher levels of output and increased profitability will increase
employees' expectations in addition to whatever happens to inflation,' said
Mr Alistair Hatchett, editor of Incomes Data Report.
This could make it even harder for the government to keep the lid on
public-sector pay costs. Rises are still running almost neck and neck with
the private sector in spite of government policy and the first signs of
private-sector revival.
A number of public sector unions, particularly Unison with its large
membership in local government, will be able to draw arguments from the
earnings data to sustain their efforts to secure a substantial pay rise in
that sector.
Others may find it harder to whip up popular backing for their pay campaigns
 -not least the Royal College of Nursing, which is trying to convince the
review body covering nurses' earnings that they deserve a pay rise of at
least 8 per cent.
The survey evidence also looks set to fuel the debate inside the Labour
party on the introduction of a national minimum wage - there is likely to be
a fierce argument on this at its conference next week.
The Public Finance Foundation calculated yesterday that the lowest-paid 10
per cent of workers would need a minimum wage of Pounds 4.15 an hour to
ensure it is half the male median earnings, the target many in the Labour
party would like to set.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Public-sector rises exceed guidelines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many of those employed in Britain's public sector continue to enjoy pay
rises well above the government's own wage guidelines and the monthly pay
index.
This is the surprising but firm conclusion to be drawn from the detailed
evidence in the first instalment of this year's New Earnings Survey
published by the Department of Employment yesterday.
But the picture is highly diverse, with winners and losers in both the
public and private-sector pay league tables.
The biggest boost to pay in the public sector in the year to April was for
women employed full-time in the BBC - their average earnings climbed by 12.2
per cent to Pounds 500.80 for a 37-hour week. They were followed by
full-time women secretaries and typists in the civil service, with a 7.5 per
cent rise in earnings to Pounds 257.40 for a 37-hour week.
The highest percentage rises among full-time male employees in the public
sector were those employed as scientific officers in the civil service with
a 6.8 per cent increase to Pounds 451.30 for a 37.5-hour week.
They were followed by female nurses and midwives who had a 6.2 per cent rise
in average earnings to Pounds 305.40 for a 38-hour working week. Ambulance
workers were next with a 6.1 per cent rise to Pounds 313.20 for a massive
49.7-hour week, including 5.4 hours of overtime.
Male teachers in England and Wales secured 3.4 per cent rises to an average
Pounds 454.70 for a 30.4-hour working week while their female colleagues had
3.8 per cent rises to Pounds 395.30 for a 30.1-hour week.
Men employed in the higher and middle grades of the civil service had 3.7
per cent rises to Pounds 417.90 for a 38.9-hour working week but their
female colleagues secured 3.4 per cent in earnings to Pounds 344.30 for a
38.4-hour working week.
There have been some losers in the public sector. Male police had average
pay rises of only 0.3 per cent to Pounds 446.80 for a 42-hour week while
firefighters had 1.1 per cent, taking them to an average Pounds 344.60 for a
43.6-hour week. Both of those groups have their pay linked to the earnings
of others.
Male manual workers in local government in England and Wales had only a 1.8
per cent earnings rise to Pounds 241 for 47.3 hours a week while in Scotland
the comparable group secured a 1.2 per cent improvement to Pounds 248.30 for
a 50.1-hour working week. Low earnings increases were also recorded for
academics (up 1.2 per cent for men and 2.6 per cent for women).
In the private sector the picture is even more diverse, with some
substantial earnings increases in a number of industries and services.
The largest earnings boost was recorded among males in the managerial and
professional group at British Telecommunications, with a 22.6 per cent
increase taking their pre-tax pay to Pounds 702.00 for a 41.6-hour working
week.
Substantial improvements were also recorded for men in British Gas (10.1 per
cent), the car industry (13.0 per cent), ceramics (16.6 per cent) and
general printing in England and Wales.
The survey also reveals widespread regional pay differences.

FT  30 SEP 94 / ICL formalises link with Virgin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Virgin Group, which last year announced it was entering the personal
computer market, has formalised an agreement with ICL, the UK-based computer
company, to manufacture its range of desktop and notebook computers.
The deal, which includes joint marketing and distribution, is thought to be
worth about Pounds 5m to ICL in the first year and at least double that in
subsequent years.
The Virgin computers will be slanted towards the games and multimedia
markets and marketed through both Virgin and ICL channels. ICL will also
have the right to use the Virgin name on some equipment.
The UK company, in which Fujitsu of Japan has a majority stake, believes the
Virgin name may help it penetrate the home-office and small-office market in
mainland Europe.
ICL's own-brand computers are chiefly aimed at business markets.
ICL has been assembling up to 1,000 Virgin computers a month on an informal
basis since the leisure group entered the market. Virgin distributes its PC
products through its shops, mail catalogues and a small distribution
network.

FT  30 SEP 94 / NHS boss urges pay reform caution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Health Service's chief executive yesterday cast doubts over the
government's plans to get health service trusts to introduce local pay deals
next spring.
Ministers have been encouraging the independent pay review bodies covering
health workers in trusts, including community and ambulance services as well
as hospitals, not to recommend a national pay increase but to leave pay to
be determined by local trusts.
But Mr Alan Langlands, chief executive of the NHS, admitted yesterday that
the national pay framework would 'not disappear overnight'.
He said what was needed was a 'pragmatic' approach to introducing local pay.
He added that the new system needed to be introduced in a 'careful and
patient and determined way'.
Mr Langlands, speaking after the NHS Trust Federation's annual conference in
Brighton, said instructions given earlier this year were not so much an
order but a signal that the government meant business.
'We don't expect everyone to achieve everything to the timetable that was
set out then,' he said.
Mr Langlands' comments are in contrast to the line set out by the Department
of Health in its evidence to the pay review body. Doctors and nurses have
reacted angrily to the proposals and vowed to fight for a national pay
award.
Unison, the public service union, has signed formal recognition agreements
with more than half of the 419 NHS trusts. In virtually every other trust it
has secured de facto recognition and is working towards formal agreements.
Mr Alan Jinkinson, Unison's general secretary, speaking at his union's
health group conference in Bournemouth, said yesterday that it had been
predicted that the advent of trusts would result in massive derecognition of
unions.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Post Office watchdog raps sell-off plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government proposals to privatise the Post Office were roundly condemned
yesterday by the industry's leading user group, adding to a succession of
critical responses in recent weeks.
The Post Office Users' National Council, the industry's watchdog, said it
was concerned that the government's favoured option for privatisation
involved splitting up the postal service, threatening levels of service.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has yet to gain final
cabinet approval for legislation to sell 51 per cent of the state-owned
utility. But his favoured option is to proceed with privatisation of the
Royal Mail and Parcelforce, while hiving off the Post Office's counters
division - which is responsible for high street and village post offices -
into a separate organisation to remain in the public sector.
Mr John Hackney, the council's chairman, criticised Mr Heseltine for failing
to offer an option retaining all the Post Office's businesses in one
organisation, whatever its ownership.
He added that users were also concerned at the lack of detail in the green
paper, published this summer, as to the benefits likely to flow from
privatisation and on the possible nature of the delivery and counters
service.
In the green paper Mr Heseltine provided assurances that a privatised Royal
Mail would be obliged to retain a nationwide letters delivery service.
Hiving off the counters division was intended to reassure rural dwellers
that there would be no wholesale closures among the 20,000 village post
offices.
However, the opposition parties and postal unions have been raising fears
that existing post offices and levels of service would be jeopardised by
privatisation.
Several Conservative MPs have voiced similar concerns, putting the
government's small parliamentary majority in question if it decides to
proceed.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Rival to Exchange plans extra facility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tradepoint, the new electronic share-dealing system, says it has completed
the arrangement of settlement facilities which will enable a wider range of
clients to use it.
Tradepoint, which is seeking authorisation as a registered investment
exchange, will offer an 'order-matching' facility for institutions and
investment banks to buy and sell securities outside the London Stock
Exchange. The exchange sees competition from potential rivals such as
Tradepoint as one of its biggest challenges.
The only system available for the settlement of UK equities in London is the
Talisman system, which is owned and operated by the Stock Exchange.
The exchange's control of the settlement process has limited the growth of
competing exchanges.
Tradepoint's settlement will be done through the London Clearing House,
which clears trades for four London-based futures exchanges. It is owned by
the UK's six largest banks.
At the close of each day's trading, the Clearing House will calculate the
open settlement position of each participant and compare it with the price
at which the security was bought or sold. If the price of the purchased
securities has fallen, the participants will be asked for additional margin.
Tradepoint will be able to use the Crest settlement system, being developed
by the Bank of England, when it becomes fully operational.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Walker's QC accuses two 'evil directors'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr George Walker, the former chairman of the Brent Walker property and
leisure group who is accused of illegal profit-boosting, may have been taken
advantage of by two 'evil' directors of the company's film division, the Old
Bailey was told yesterday.
In his closing speech to the jury, Mr Colin Nicholls, QC for Mr Walker, said
he still denied prosecution claims that the company's profits had been
fraudulently inflated by Pounds 19m.
However, it was possible that Mr John Quested and Mr Donald Anderson, the
former managing director and finance director of the Brent Walker film
subsidiary, had 'taken advantage' of Mr Walker's trust and friendship for
their own purposes.
Mr Walker and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, a former Brent Walker finance director,
deny charges of theft, false accounting and conspiring to falsify the Brent
Walker accounts. Mr Quested and Mr Anderson have been named by the
prosecution as co-conspirators.
Mr Nicholls said that Mr Quested, the former managing director of the film
division, was 'well in evidence' at the time the fraud was supposed to have
taken place.
He was 'in the background, but you can do a lot in the background'. His
conduct was 'highly suspect', added Mr Nicholls. Mr Quested was a 'practised
forger' and the prosecution had accepted that some documents in the case
might have been forged by him.
It could be that in letting staff look after the detailed work of deals, Mr
Walker had trusted them too much. During the period when the fraud was
alleged to have occurred, 'these two evil men' had been left to do what they
wanted, Mr Nicholls suggested. 'Is the fault of Mr Walker that he trusted
his friends too much? That may be one of the reasons why he is here now,' Mr
Nicholls said. The trial continues today.

FT  30 SEP 94 / British film directors to buy Shepperton Studios
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two leading British film directors, Mr Ridley Scott and Mr Tony Scott, are
to buy Shepperton Studios, west of London, in a deal thought to be worth
about Pounds 10m, Michael Skapinker writes.
The two brothers say they want to develop the studios into one of the
world's leading film production facilities.
Mr Ridley Scott was the director of such films as Alien, Blade Runner and
Thelma and Louise. Mr Tony Scott directed Top Gun and Beverly Hills Cop II.
Mr Ridley Scott said yesterday that they would use their knowledge of the US
film industry to ensure an increase in the number of films produced at the
studios.
Shepperton Studios, founded in 1936, is owned by Lee International, a
private UK company. Recent productions include Four Weddings And A Funeral
and Frankenstein. A science fiction film starring Sylvester Stallone, Judge
Dredd, is being made there.
Mr Ridley Scott said the studios were in a healthy financial state, with
pre-tax profits last year of Pounds 1.3m and higher profits expected for
1994.
He said that one of their priorities would be to increase the studios' share
of post-production film business. Several directors who had made films at
the studios had in the past gone elsewhere for such services. He said
revenues from the post-production phase of film making were high.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Labour attacks cost of Welsh quangos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 10 largest quangos in Wales spend more than Pounds 26m a year on board
members and administration, the Labour party said yesterday.
Publishing a survey of quango costs, Labour claimed 'vast sums' were being
spent on their executive tier and on 'wasteful' overheads. It argued that
the amount would amply fund an elected Welsh assembly which, together with
local authorities, could take over control of their board functions.
Mr Ron Davies, shadow Welsh secretary, said in Cardiff: 'The existing quango
system is not only unaccountable but has become inefficient and in some
cases corrupt.' The survey, he said, 'demolishes comprehensively' the
Conservatives' argument for retaining quangos that a Welsh assembly would
cost too much.
While Mr Davies stressed his support for the work of many of the quangos,
including the Welsh Development Agency, he said: 'I am convinced that local
government and a Welsh assembly could do the job of quango boards cheaper
and more efficiently, not to mention with more accountability and probity.'
He added: 'We have in effect an extra tax in Wales to pay for the Tories'
political failure. They need quangos to find jobs for failed Tories because
they can't win elections.' The Conservatives hold only six of the 38
parliamentary seats in Wales.
The survey, based on replies to a questionnaire sent to 110 Welsh
non-departmental public bodies, or quangos, found that the 10 largest paid
their total of 89 board members an average of Pounds 10,495 a year each in
remuneration and expenses.
This compared with an average of under Pounds 3,000 in allowances and
expenses for Welsh councillors. Their administrative costs, including
buildings and expenses but excluding staff salaries, totalled Pounds 25.6m.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Tec to be warned over payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Thames Training and Enterprise Council is expected to be warned next
week that it is in breach of its contract and that it must take urgent
remedial action in its financial monitoring systems by the end of the year.
The action is the first taken by the Department of Employment against any of
the 82 Tecs which administer government training in England and Wales,
although it is understood that the department is in discussion with others
over similar problems.
Tecs receive about Pounds 2bn in public funds to deliver programmes
including Youth Training and Training for Work, a scheme for unemployed
adults.
The problem at South Thames concerns lack of adequate controls over payments
to providers of training. There is understood to be no question of
dishonesty involving anyone at the Tec.
In August the Tec's finance director resigned after its non-executive board
expressed concerns over accountancy matters. Mr Michael Hanson, the chief
executive, who was admired for his vision of training and enterprise in the
inner-city area, has also resigned.
It is understood that the Tec's auditors are awaiting details of the breach
notice before deciding whether to qualify its accounts.
Tecs have had problems in accounting fully for the money they spend with the
private and public-sector bodies with which they contract to provide
training.
Mr Tim Hoult, chairman of South Thames Tec, said yesterday: 'The breach
notice is not a surprise to us. We have a remedial action plan and I am
quietly confident that the action we are taking will result in the breach
notice being lifted.'

Sales of unit trusts rose last month to a net Pounds 773m from Pounds 646m
in July. However, the figure was below the net sales of Pounds 981m in
August last year.
The number of accounts was a record 6.04m. The figure has risen by a third
since January 1992, as private investors have turned to equity-related
products in the search for better returns against a background of low

FT  30 SEP 94 / Dealers warn on new-car figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The retail motor trade last night renewed its call for car manufacturers to
stop inflating the new-car market by pre-registering cars for which there
were no actual buyers, John Griffiths writes.
Mr Derek Lindop, president of the Retail Motor Industry Federation, said
that artificially boosting the market in order to keep production lines
flowing was continuing to send the 'wrong signals' to government about the
strength of the economic recovery.
He told the institute's annual dinner, attended by Mr Michael Heseltine, the
trade secretary, that the practice of pre-registration - in which cars are
later sold as 'used' but with only nominal mileage - was undermining the
viability of the 7,000 franchised dealers.
The year-on-year sales increase of nearly 10 per cent shown by the
statistics greatly overstated underlying growth. This was closer to 4 per
cent.

Hot and heavy dance bands can virtually forget it. But there will definitely
be a place for pop stars of a certain age - Tina Turner and Phil Collins or
bands such as U2 - on VH-1, the 24-hour satellite music station that

The channel, setting out to be a grown-up version of MTV, will be launched
by the pop star Prince at a party for 2,000 at one of the UK's most
nostalgic rock venues - the Roundhouse in London's Camden Town.
'Image-orientated brands' that have already signed up for the new channel -
part of British Sky Broadcasting's Multi-Channels package - range from JVC
and IBM to Calvin Klein and Levis.
'It's a testimony to VH-1's ability to reach a pure 25 to 49-year-old UK
demographic,' Mr Frank Brown, director of advertising sales for MTV Networks
Europe, said yesterday.
VH-1, which stands for Video Hits One, would be 'an aspirational channel'.
But it would not be 'a boys with guitars channel' according to Mr Brent
Hansen, creative director to MTV Networks Europe.
About 60 per cent of the output will have a current feel. There will be rock
and soul and some room for nostalgia.
From the vaults of BBC2, VH-1 will present the best of the seminal 1970s
series The Old Grey Whistle Test. In November Eric Idle will host a vintage
1970s edition of Saturday Night Live with Kate Bush as the musical guest.
The presenters have also been chosen more for their knowledge of music than
for their youth.
VH-1, like MTV and the children's channel Nickelodeon, is part of Viacom,
the US media group that recently took over Paramount.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Brown champions 'fair rewards': Conservatives branded as the
party of economic privilege and greed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, yesterday sought to flesh out
Labour's vision of a fair market economy by depicting the party as defender
of the 'decent majority' against Conservative privilege and greed.
Mr Brown's comments, which will set the tone for the economic debate at
Labour's conference in Blackpool on Monday, coincided with two opinion polls
confirming Labour's strong lead since Mr Tony Blair's election as leader in
July.
Officials said the contrast between Labour's commitment to fair rewards and
the Tories' sponsorship of the 'undeserving rich' would be a key part of Mr
Blair's first conference speech as leader, on Tuesday.
However, Mr Jeremy Hanley, the Conservative party chairman, accused Labour's
leaders of using 'jargon and gobbledegook' to cover up the party's
continuing attachment to taxation and spending. Launching a pamphlet called
Rhetoric and Reality, Mr Hanley said the Labour leader was 'a dedicated
follower of fashion' who had 'failed to stand up for his convictions' when
Labour was controlled by the left in the early 1980s.
Mr Brown told the Association of Metropolitan Authorities in Newcastle that
Labour would end the accumulation of unjustified privilege that had happened
under 15 years of Conservative government.
He said that deserving businessmen who generated ideas, jobs and wealth
should be properly rewarded as long as they paid their fair share of taxes.
'But there is an undeserving rich, the enemies of opportunity, the
something-for-nothing elite, who have let the country down,' he said.
Mr Brown accused the government of allowing a proliferation of patronage
through quangos, together with insider dealing and the misuse of executive
share options which allowed millionaires to avoid paying their fair share of
taxes.
A MORI poll in today's Times puts Labour 29 points ahead of the
Conservatives on 54 per cent of the vote, down from 56 per cent in late
August. The Tories are on 25 per cent (23) and the Liberal Democrats on 17
per cent (18).
A MORI poll for the Economist puts Labour on 52 per cent (47 per cent in
April) with the Conservatives on 25 per cent (26) and the Liberal Democrats
on 18 per cent (23).

FT  30 SEP 94 / MPs to probe capacity in steel industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An influential committee of MPs is to probe the British steel industry in a
move timed to coincide with the announcement of a package of capacity cuts
by European Union steel producers.
The Commons trade and industry committee will focus on the consequences of
the EU initiative for domestic steel-makers. It aims to complete its report
by December.
Mr Richard Caborn, committee chairman, said there was 'great concern across
the whole of the British steel industry' about the EU package. 'Yet again we
potentially have to take cuts in our steel industry when we have already
restructured and made Britain the most efficient steel producer in the
world,' he added.
He called for 'far better policing of capacity cuts and financial
restructurings than is in place at the moment'.
Non-subsidised steelmakers have been given until November to finalise a
package of cuts, which need to be agreed before the European Commission will
approve an Ecu240m (Pounds 189m) aid package. British Steel is not offering
any cuts.
The extended deadline for the cuts, agreed earlier this year between
industry chiefs and Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, averted a
collapse in relations between the commission and unsubsidised EU steel
producers.
These companies have been reluctant to offer the full amount of capacity
cuts required by the commission because they do not believe the commission
has taken a tough enough line on curbing subsidies to some producers, mainly
in Germany, Italy and Spain.
The European Court recently confirmed it was to investigate a complaint from
British Steel about subsidies received by Ilva of Italy and CSI of Spain.
The two companies received the lion's share of Ecu7bn of aid approved by EU
industry ministers in December and authorised by the commission in April.
Under the chairmanship of Mr Caborn, Labour MP for Sheffield Central, the
trade and industry committee has developed a reputation for delivering
timely and hard-hitting reports on controversial subjects, including the
coal industry, the Post Office and optical-fibre networks.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Universities plan business links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
University vice-chancellors announced yesterday that they would create a new
post of chief executive to help build links between higher education and the
private sector.
Dr Kenneth Edwards, chairman of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and
Principals, which ended its annual conference in Birmingham yesterday, said:
'Universities need to become more entrepreneurial than ever. They must find
more public and private investment to restructure and re-equip for new
teaching and learning techniques.'
He added that universities played 'a key role in supporting economic
regeneration', and that they were bound to become 'even more central to
civic life' as more people entered higher education.
The committee had previously resisted creating a chief executive in favour
of a more loose organisation.
Dr Edwards - the vice-chancellor of Leicester University - also claimed that
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, would need to introduce new
funding arrangements.
Mrs Shephard had told the committee: 'Universities have achieved
considerable success in the past decade or so. Now that we are in a period
of consolidation, we must not miss the chance to make sure our quality
systems are equally good.'
But the committee said: 'Those achievements will be short-lived if
government does not ensure that the system is adequately funded.'
Vice-chancellors said the system of subsidised loans to cover student living
costs should be reformed immediately. Repayments should be tied to the
National Insurance system, linking them closer to graduates' incomes and
reducing collection costs.
But the Department for Education ruled out any change to the loans system
until 1997 at the earliest.
The committee also agreed to review the admissions system to take into
account the wider range of entry qualifications now being offered such as
General National Vocational Qualifications.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Capital gains tax should be top priority in November budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A reform of capital gains tax should be the top business priority in the
November Budget, the Institute of Directors said yesterday, Gillian Tett
writes.
IoD director-general Tim Melville-Ross and policy unit head Ann Robinson
(above) also urged the government to reduce public spending significantly to
improve government finances and pave the way for tax cuts later.
The institute is calling for a package of carefully selected tax cuts of
about Pounds 1.25bn for the next financial year to boost business
investment, followed by Pounds 5bn tax cuts the following year, and a
further Pounds 10bn in the third year.
Capital gains tax should be abolished for all gains on disposals after more
than three years, the IoD says in its Budget submission. Tax on disposals
after two years should be 10 per cent and after one year 20 per cent.
Inheritance tax should be abolished and restrictions on reliefs for trading
losses and management expenses removed.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, has repeatedly indicated that he does not
intend introducing significant tax cuts in this year's Budget. However the
IoD argues that a reduction in government spending should enable a gradual
reduction in taxes, and proposes a reduction in public spending of Pounds
20bn to Pounds 30bn in the next two years.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Drop in business failures reported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business failures fell by 13.4 per cent in England and Wales in the first
nine months of this year, says Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information
group, Jim Kelly writes.
Figures released yesterday show that about 800 businesses failed each week
in that period, a total of 31,340. This compared with 36,203 in the same
period last year.
Mr Philip Mellor, senior analyst with the group, said that the figures
showed that the level of company liquidations was falling much faster - 17.7
per cent - than the level of bankruptcies - 10.5 per cent. He said: 'Larger
companies are in a much better position to take advantage of the recovery
while smaller businesses are less able to cope with the very competitive
business climate.'
Wales was the only area where failures increased, by 4 per cent, while the
west Midlands had the largest drop in England at 26.7 per cent.

FT  30 SEP 94 / IRA still recruiting, secret service tells PM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The IRA has continued to seek new recruits and to shadow police and army
patrols in Northern Ireland in spite of its declared end to violence last
month.
Evidence from British intelligence that the organisation has sustained a
capacity to resume military operations has reinforced Mr John Major's
cautious response to the ceasefire.
It coincides with growing anger in Belfast about a spate of 'punishment
shootings' by the IRA in nationalist areas since the ceasefire declaration.
The IRA has also continued actively to operate the criminal 'racketeering'
from which it derives much of its finance.
Taken alongside uncompromising comments from Mr Gerry Adams and Mr Martin
McGuinness, the leading figures in Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, the
intelligence has dampened hopes of an imminent breakthrough to pave the way
for direct talks between the London government and Sinn Fein.
Mr Adams warned this week on his high-profile tour of the US of a possible
resurgence of violence if progress towards a political settlement were to
reach deadlock. Mr McGuinness said he would never use the word 'permanent'
to describe the ceasefire.
Despite the two men's insistence they have no direct links with the IRA,
British ministers insist both are on the organisation's ruling Army Council.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, reported to the cabinet
yesterday on the latest developments in the province, but a substantive
review of Sinn Fein's position will not take place until after Mr Adams's US
tour.
In the meantime there is little prospect of any further gesture by the UK
government in the direction of Sinn Fein - such as the lifting of the
exclusion order which bars Mr Adams from mainland Britain.
Whitehall officials stress that they do not believe that the latest
developments necessarily mark a retreat by the IRA from last month's
announcement.
The socialist group in the European Parliament yesterday nominated Mr John
Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, for
the Nobel Peace Prize.
Dr John Alderdice, leader of the non-sectarian Alliance party yesterday had
a meeting with Mr Major, in which he urged the prime minister to open direct
contacts with the IRA if Sinn Fein leaders persisted in saying they could
not speak for the paramilitaries. The purpose of these contacts would be to
discuss the handover of IRA weapons.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Price competition prompts Nestle to cut 515 more jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A further 515 jobs are to be cut in the UK by Nestle following the Swiss
multinational's decision to end processing in the UK of all canned foods
other than its milk products.
The company said the decision had been prompted by price competition in
canned foods and the fact that its Crosse &amp; Blackwell brand had only a 2 per
cent share of that market sector.
Mr Graham Millar, managing director of Nestle Food Division, said the food
canning operations were 'unprofitable in the face of intense competition'.
Its baked beans, for example, had been selling for 29p a can two years ago,
but other processors' own-label beans for supermarkets were now selling for
as little as 7p a can.
Nestle added that the Crosse &amp; Blackwell brand, which it acquired more than
30 years ago, would be kept for products such as Branston Pickle and
low-calorie dressings.
The cuts, following the loss of 450 administrative jobs this summer, will
hit three factories. The plant at Milnthorpe, Cumbria, will close by next
August with the loss of 190 jobs.
The plant's tomato ketchup and standard salad cream lines will be withdrawn,
its fruit juice contracted out to a subsidiary of Coca-Cola and its
low-calorie dressings transferred to Nestle's plant in Peterhead,
Aberdeenshire.
The group's Staverton, Wiltshire, plant will lose 145 jobs when canning ends
next March, but its chilled food operations will be retained.
The Peterhead plant will lose 180 jobs when canning of soups, beans and
pasta ends next June - but it will become Nestle's 'centre of excellence'
for Branston Pickle.
Nestle UK employs 17,000 people. The prospect of widespread job losses was
raised earlier this year when it began a review of all UK operations to
improve competitiveness.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Fresh bid for EU opt-out will hit disabled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STRASBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The government is seeking to withdraw its support for a European Union
scheme to assist the disabled.
Money for the scheme was voted into next year's EU budget by the Council of
Ministers last July, but the Department of Health is now taking legal advice
as to whether it is bound by the decision.
The move comes hard on the heels of last month's decision by Mr Michael
Portillo, the employment minister, to withdraw government departments from
the priority suppliers scheme to help disabled workers.
Mr Portillo argued that EU rules on public procurement prohibited
discriminating in favour of the disabled in the award of government
contracts, although the European Commission in Brussels insists this is not
the intention of the law.
The latest instance, revealed yesterday by Mr Hugh McMahon, Labour spokesman
on social affairs at the European Parliament, concerns a scheme called
Handynet.
This is an EU-wide database providing information on equipment and services
intended to help the disabled live independently. It comes under the Helios
programme, which has been voted Ecu25m (Pounds 19.7m) from the EU budget for
the next three years, of which Handynet would get some Ecu4.2m.
But in a letter to disabled people's organisations, the Department of Health
on September 27 said that junior health minister Mr Gerry Malone 'has
advised officials that he remains to be convinced about the value of
Handynet and has requested information about how the DoH can withdraw its
support'.
The letter continues: 'Officials have asked solicitors for their view as to
whether under the terms of the original Council (of Ministers) decision, the
DoH can legally withdraw its support.'
Savings would amount to the Pounds 300,000 administrative costs of the
scheme, but the letter - signed by Ms Glynis Philips of the department's
health care administration - warns that 'any saving would not necessarily be
ploughed back into disabled people's projects'.
An official at the Department of Health last night confirmed that the review
was to have been completed by yesterday, ahead of a meeting of the social
affairs working group involving state officials in Brussels next week. He
said the department had 'great difficulty' finding anybody in the UK who
said Handynet was a good thing. But he added that 'if solicitors say we
can't withdraw, then that's the end of the matter'.
Mr McMahon said: 'We have established that yet another British opt-out would
not end the Europe-wide scheme at this stage, but simply deprive British
disabled people of its benefits.'

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eleventh-hour negotiations to prise open Japanese markets to US goods and
services resume in Washington today. Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's
international trade and industry minister, and Mr Yohei Kono, the Japanese
foreign minister, return to Washington after breaking off talks earlier in
the week because of urgent parliamentary business in Tokyo.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative said the ministers were 'very
aware' of the US resolve in the matter, which will culminate either in trade
peace, deadlock or partial deals and partial sanctions.
Firmly re-stating the US position on the framework negotiations, Mr Kantor
warned Japan that he will accept nothing less than 'real, substantial,
concrete, tangible agreements' to resolve the trans-Pacific trade imbalance.
Negotiations, which have stretched fruitlessly over the past 14 months
resume hours before the US deadline for new Japanese offers to open markets.
Whether or not such a deal emerges by midnight tonight - the US deadline for
sanctions if there is no agreement - Mr Kantor said he would make an
announcement on Japan trade tomorrow.
'We're dedicated to altering a situation in which our market is open to
their goods and their market is closed to our goods. That situation has to
be remedied,' Mr Kantor said. 'We are going to adhere strictly to the
dictates of the framework,' he added, referring to talks that have yielded
no results.
A US official said that Washington means business by the midnight deadline
and will not countenance any delays. 'Either way, this is finished
Saturday.'
Meanwhile lower-level officials will keep talking, with both sides aware
that a failure to find common ground this week could mark a dangerous
downturn in trans-Pacific ties. Four sectors are under negotiation: cars,
procurement, insurance and glass.
US officials have all but ruled out a deal on cars and scoffed at Japanese
suggestions Mr Hashimoto will present a new offer in the sector.
US retaliatory action, however, would be some months in coming. If the US
sends a list of market barriers to Congress under the Super 301 law, a
three-week period of consultations would follow. On October 21,
investigations would be initiated and it could take another year to 18
months before sanctions are imposed unilaterally.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
A DECADE OF DEADLINES
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
1986: Semi-conductors pact. US threatens heavy penalty duties on
Japanese chips unless Japan stops selling at below market prices in US
and allows US manufactuers larger share of Japanese market. US imposes
deadline for agreement but extends this several times as negotiators
struggle to find mechanism for increasing US share without setting
precise percentages or targets. Finally, stern midnight deadline
imposed; agreement reached minutes before it expires.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
1987: Legal services accord. US threatens to charge Japan with unfair
trading practices and impose tariffs or quotas. 'Japan has been
virtually closed to foreign lawyers for over 30 years,' says Clayton
Yeutter, US trade representative. Japan agrees to expand kinds of legal
matters US lawyers can deal with.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
1988: Beef and citrus fruit agreement. Japan agrees to remove
non-tariff barriers on range of products and reduce tariffs on others,
thereby avoiding US investigation of Japanese restrictions. US
withdraws complaint to Gatt. Yeutter hails agreement as 'a great day
for American agriculture, a great day for Japanese consumers.'
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
1989: Radio and cellular telephones. Another US deadline approaches,
this time for President Bush to make good threat to impose sanctions on
potential 50-item list of products including colour television
receivers, tape recorders and photocopiers. In more cliff-hanger
negotiations, Japan agrees to improve access to broadcast spectrum for
radio and cellular telephones and to provide comparable access to its
cellular telephone market. Japan names a cellular telephone operator to
install Motorola system; US claims that, by doing so, Japan assumes
responsibility to ensure that operator performs.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
1990: Wood products. Five days before deadline on which US will, for a
second year, target Japan as unfair trading partner under possible
Super 301 sanctions, Japan agrees to remove various barriers to sale of
US wood products. US removes Japan for trading-partners 'hit list'.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
1991: Public works. US threatens to bar Japanese companies from
federally funded construction projects and sets another deadline. This
extended by 13 hours to allow for overnight negotiating; Japan agrees
to double number of government-funded construction projects open to US
bidders and introduce more-open bidding system covering both material
and consulting services.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
1992: Paper products. US complains that Japan imports only 3.7 per cent
of paper and paperboard products, of which only 1.7 per cent come from
US. Agreement signed calling for Japanese authorities to encourage
important paper users to adopt written purchasing guidelines applicable
to both domestic and foreign suppliers.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
1994: Cellular telephones. US trade representative Mickey Kantor,
brandishing a Motorola telephone, accuses Japan of violating 1989
fair-access agreement, saying santicions would be announced within 30
days. At the last minute, Japanese authorities agree to monitor
progress in investment by private operator in Motorola's system, to
back low-interest loans from Japan Development Bank for that purpose,
and to allocate more radio frequency to Motorola system.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
1994: Public procurement of telecommunications, insurance, access to
car and car parts markets. US sets midnight, end-September deadline for
agreements, saying that without agreement US law would require
sanctions machinery to be put in train. Ryutaro Hashimoto,
international trade and industry minister, despatched to Washington at
last minute to try to resolve issues with Kantor. Further all-night
negotiating sessions are expected.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Senator George Mitchell, the Democratic majority leader in the US Senate,
said yesterday he would hold a rare post-election session of Congress 'if
necessary' to achieve US ratification of the Uruguay Round trade legislation
by the end of this year.
Senator Ernest Hollings, chairman of the senate commerce committee,
meanwhile showed no sign of backing down from his intention to delay the
legislation for 45 working days by holding 'a nationwide debate' over US
trade policy. This would keep the legislation off the senate floor until
after the congressional elections on November 8.
It has been expected that the House would vote next Wednesday to approve the
Uruguay Round deal. But members who have come under strong pressure from
Gatt opponents may prefer to delay a vote until after the election.
A delay in the House vote until November might also be beneficial in the
Senate, where Republicans such as Senator Robert Dole, minority leader, seem
tempted to use the issue for partisan advantage.
The Senate Finance Committee yesterday approved the legislation by a 19-0
vote. Senator Dole did not vote on the pact and has refused to say if he
will support it.
Senator Hollings, a longtime supporter of the textile industry, can delay
Senate action under special 'fast-track' rules, which require a Yes or No
vote on legislation implementing trade deals. Chairmen of committees that
have jurisdiction over the legislation have 45 days to hold hearings.
The American Textile Manufacturers' Institute yesterday said it was
surprised by the senator's move to delay the Senate vote. 'This legislation
includes some vitally important provisions for the US textile industry,' it
said. Damage done to textile producers by phasing out quotas would be offset
by inclusion of a rule of origin that prevents countries from circumventing
quota limits, it said.
Kept busy by healthcare, foreign policy and partisan attacks, President Bill
Clinton has had little opportunity to sell the benefits of the trade pact.
During the formal end-of-summit press conference with the Russian president,
Mr Boris Yeltsin, he took the opportunity to urge approval of the Gatt
agreement and advertise its merits.
'This is the biggest trade agreement in history,' he said. 'It will give us
300,000 to 500,000 new high-wage jobs in the next few years.'
The foes of the Gatt deal have taken up Senator Hollings as a hero. 'We're
impressed with Senator Hollings's courage on this issue,' said Mr Andrew
Wheat, spokesman for the Gatt Project. Ms Caroline Kazdin, legislative
director of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers' Union, said the
senator was doing the country 'a big service by bringing the substance of
this thing to the public eye'. Polls suggest most voters know nothing about
the Gatt deal, but when it is explained to them, they oppose it, she said.
Although even most of the opponents believe the legislation will ultimately
pass, they are by no means giving up their campaign against US ratification
of the trade treaty.

FT  30 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Eurocopter to develop new civil aircraft
in Russia

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Eurocopter, the Franco-German maker of helicopters, has created a joint
venture with Mil, the Russian aircraft design bureau, to study the
development of a large civil helicopter capable of carrying 30 passengers.
The deal is a significant advance in co-operation between western aerospace
companies and manufacturers in the former Soviet Union and breaks ground in
technical co-operation between old adversaries.
Mil, which also produces military helicopters, designed the heavily armed
Red Army gunships which would have fought Nato in a European war. Similarly,
Eurocopter is designing the Tiger anti-tank attack helicopter which should
be deployed with Nato forces by the year 2000.
Initially the venture will produce a relatively inexpensive feasibility
study but investment of up to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) could be required if
the helicopter is put into design and production.
Under the terms of the agreement, Eurocopter would provide the avionics,
cockpit and cabin layout with Mil controlling the overall design.
The engines for the heavy-lift helicopter will be produced by the
Kazan-based Klimov company. If it is built, the 14-tonne helicopter could
challenge the Anglo-Italian EH101 in the large passenger transport sector of
the market in 10 years. Sikorsky of the US is also considering production of
a large transport helicopter.
Most helicopters of this type are produced for military purposes, and the
civilian market has been limited to specialist applications such as
transporting oil workers offshore.
Eurocopter, itself a joint company between Aerospatiale of France and
Deutsche Aerospace, was aware of Mil's intention to build a heavy passenger
helicopter, and realised it could have a market in the west, with the
advantage of low costs. Eurocopter will be responsible for all sales outside
Russia.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Just a year after hitting the international campaign trail in his efforts to
secure a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round, Mr Peter Sutherland,
director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, is
globe-trotting once again, this time to lobby for quick ratification of the
deal, writes Frances Williams in Geneva.
Mr Sutherland told members of the Australia-New Zealand Business Council in
Auckland yesterday that next January's deadline for establishment of the
World Trade Organisation, Gatt's successor, was one nobody could afford to
miss.
The visit to Australasia follows trips earlier this month to Latin America
and to Brussels. Next week Mr Sutherland will be in Madrid for the IMF/World
Bank meeting where he is expected to buttonhole ministers to urge completion
of ratification procedures this year. He has also been in telephone contact
with Washington and some other key trading nations.
A special implementation conference to decide on the date the Uruguay Round
accords come into force has been scheduled for December in Geneva. But, with
the timing of ratification in the US and the European Union clouded by
uncertainty, most of Gatt's 123 members have taken a wait-and-see approach.
Only 26 have ratified so far and the number has not budged since the summer.
Still, a letter from Mr Sutherland to all trade ministers earlier this month
has elicited a 'very positive response', according to Gatt officials. The
majority have told Gatt they expect to complete ratification by the end of
the year.

FT  30 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Balkan oil pipeline will be boost for
Russians - The project will provide an alternative to shipping Moscow's
crude through the Bosporus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An agreement between the Greek and Bulgarian governments approving the
construction of a Dollars 700m pipeline to ship oil from the Black Sea to
the Mediterranean should open up a new outlet for Russian oil exports by the
end of the 1990s.
The protocol signed in Thessaloniki earlier this month gives the go-ahead
for TransBalkan Pipeline, a Greek-Russian consortium, to build a 350km
pipeline to carry crude oil from Burgas in Bulgaria to Alexandroupolis in
north-eastern Greece.
The project, proposed early this year by two private Greek enterprises, the
Latsis shipping and oil refining group, and the Copelouzos construction
group, has been received with enthusiasm both in Athens and Moscow, where a
Greek-Russian accord giving political backing for the pipeline was signed
earlier this month.
The pipeline, with capacity to carry 35m-40m tonnes of oil yearly, would
provide an alternative to shipping Russian oil through the Bosporus. The
Turkish government in July imposed restrictions on the passage of
supertankers, citing the need to improve safety and environmental controls
following the disastrous collision of two Greek-owned tankers in the straits
in March.
Moreover, the participation in TransBalkan Pipeline of Gazprom, the Russian
state-controlled energy supplier, with an equity stake of up to 50 per cent,
will ensure that the Russians maintain their grip on oil export routes from
the former Soviet Union. Gazprom is expected to invite several Russian oil
companies to take up part of its holding.
Latsis and Copelouzos will be the other main participants in the consortium,
together with Prometheus, a joint venture between Gazprom and the Copelouzos
group which was set up to carry out energy projects in Greece.
Gazprom is already involved in the construction of a 600km pipeline, due to
be completed next year, and bringing natural gas to Greece from Bulgaria.
The Bulgarian and Greek state oil companies will each be offered a small
equity stake in TransBalkan. For Bulgaria, which at present attracts little
international investment, the project also opens up broader long-term
opportunities.
Copelouzos, the group's chairman, said: 'Not only will the Bulgarians
benefit from pipeline tariffs, they would also be in a position to extend
the pipeline north and west, to the former Yugoslavia and perhaps Hungary,
at a later date.'
Moreover, there appear to be fewer political risks associated with the
project. Greece and Bulgaria have managed to avoid the kind of disputes over
minority issues that are poisoning Greek relations with both Albania and
Macedonia.
The Greek government welcomes the project for its potential contribution to
development in Thrace, one of the poorest regions in the European Union.
The pipeline will also go some way towards reducing the fears of Greek and
Cypriot shipowners, who are important carriers of Russian oil, that the new
Bosporus regulations will prove costly for their tanker operations.
The project calls for a chain of tankers to ship crude from the Russian port
of Novorossysk across the Black Sea for offloading at storage facilities in
Burgas. At the other end, oil from a tank farm at Alexandroupolis, with
capacity of some 700,000 tonnes, is to be shipped through an undersea pipe
for loading at a mooring station situated several kilometres offshore.
However, given the political tensions between Greece and Turkey, officials
involved with the project are careful to stress that the pipeline project is
not intended to replace the Bosporus route, or conflict with plans to ship
oil from the former Soviet republics by pipeline through Turkey to the
Mediterranean.
'It's not a question of wanting to monopolise Russian oil exports,' one
official said. 'With some 35m tonnes of oil moving through every year, the
Bosporus is already close to capacity.
When oil exports start from Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan new routes will be
needed.' A pre-feasibility study proposes two alternative routes for the
Bulgarian sector of the pipeline, running south-west from Burgas through the
Rodopi mountains to Thrace.
Construction is expected to start in late 1995 and would take about three
years to complete.
As the first important cross-border construction project in the Balkans, the
consortium partners sound confident that financing will not be difficult.
According to one estimate, up to 35 per cent of the cost could be covered
through EU grants, while the project would also qualify for soft loans from
the European Investment Bank. In addition, the London-based Latsis group has
ready access to financing through its network of private banks in western
Europe with equity capital that totals more than Dollars 500m.

FT  30 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Democrats attack in US Gatt row
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Senator George Mitchell, the Democratic majority leader in the US Senate,
yesterday said he would hold a rare post-election session of Congress in
order to win US ratification of the Uruguay Round trade legislation by the
end of this year.
Senator Ernest Hollings, chairman of the senate commerce committee,
yesterday showed no sign of backing down from his intention to delay the
legislation for 45 working days by holding 'a nationwide debate' over US
trade policy. This would keep the legislation off the senate floor until
after the congressional elections on November 8.
The House is expected to vote and approve the Uruguay Round deal next
Wednesday.
A key Senate aide said: 'If Hollings does not back down, we will have a lame
duck session. Gatt is not crucial to the elections, but it happens to be
crucial to the country.'
Senator Hollings, a longtime supporter of the textile industry, can delay
senate action under special 'fast-track' rules, which require a yes or no
vote on legislation implementing trade deals. Chairmen of committees that
have jurisdiction over the legislation have 45 days to hold hearings.
The American Textile Manufacturers' Institute yesterday said it was
surprised by the senator's move to delay the senate vote. 'This legislation
includes some vitally important provisions for the US textile industry,' it
said in a statement. 'We support these provisions enthusiastically.'
It said the damage done to textile producers by phasing out of quotas would
be offset by the inclusion of a rule of origin that prevents countries from
circumventing quotas limits. Between health care, foreign policy and
partisan attack, President Bill Clinton has had little opportunity to sell
the benefits of the trade pact. During the formal end-of-summit press
conference with the Russian president, Mr Boris Yeltsin, he took the
opportunity to urge approval of the Gatt agreement and advertise its merits.
'This is the biggest trade agreement in history,' he said. 'It will give us
300,000 to 500,000 new high-wage jobs in the next few years.'
The foes of the Gatt deal have taken up Senator Holllings as a hero. 'We're
impressed with Senator Hollings's courage on this issue,' said Mr Andrew
Wheat, spokesman for the Gatt Project. Ms Caroline Kazdin, legislative
director of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers' Union, said the
senator is doing the country 'a big service by bringing the substance of
this thing to the public eye'.
Polls suggest most voters know nothing about the Gatt deal, but when it is
explained to them, they oppose it, she said.
Although even most of the opponents believe the legislation will ultimately
pass, they are by no means giving up their campaign against US ratification
of the trade treaty. Mr Ralph Nader, the consumer activist who has joined
with right-wing protectionists in opposition, yesterday offered a Dollars
10,000 (Pounds 6,329) prize to the first senator or representative who
correctly answers 10 simple questions in person about the content of the
Gatt deal and signs an affidavit affirming the he has read the text of
Volume I of the three-Volume Gatt agreement.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Worlds apart on how to change world: The Bretton Woods
institutions and their persistent charity and interest group critics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They are concerned with the same issues, have offices in the same building,
but they are worlds apart.
The World Bank and to a lesser extent the International Monetary Fund are
under intense and persistent attack from a clutch of charities and interest
groups at this year's annual meeting of the two bodies in Madrid.
From a small suite of offices in the main meeting hall, household names such
as Oxfam, Greenpeace and Christian Aid are campaigning for the Bank to
change its policies. Smaller little-known organisations such as VLK, the
Slovak Forest Protection Group, are also represented, and seeking to stop
specific programmes.
The '50 years is enough campaign', a Washington-based lobby group, has
mounted a slick, well oiled crusade to cut the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund down in size.
It wants the International Development Association, the World Bank's soft
loan agency for helping the poorest developing nations, to be removed from
the Bank's control. It also is campaigning for a denial of future capital
requests to curb the Bank's ordinary lending operations and the IMF's loans
to the poorest countries through the Fund's Enhanced Structural Adjustment
Facility (ESAF).
Read the World Bank's annual report, with its account of lending operations
to promote development, and listen to the criticism from the 30-40
non-governmental organisations drawn to this year's annual meeting, and it
is difficult to believe that they have the same aims of improving the lot of
the poor of the planet.
Mr Lewis Preston, the World Bank president, yesterday declared that the two
Bretton Woods institutions had 'played a major role in co-ordinating and
financing' the development effort over the 50 years in which they have
existed.
Oxfam, by contrast, charged that the current IMF and World Bank policies
were 'actually jeopardising prospects for sustainable recovery and poverty
reduction'. Christian Aid has said that the structural adjustment programmes
of the IMF and World Bank 'are damaging the poorest people in debt burdened
developing countries'. It called for the phasing out of the IMF's enhanced
structural adjustment facility.
Greenpeace weighed in with a report saying that the World Bank was failing
to implement programmes to phase out ozone depleting substances in
developing countries and so hindering the restoration of the ozone layer.
Yet some non-government organisations also co-operate with the Fund and the
Bank. The Bank was involved in 114 projects with NGOs in its most recent
financial year to the end of June. According to Mr Preston, NGOs have some
involvement in 50 per cent of the Bank's lending activities in Africa.
Most NGO involvement is in the design, implementation and monitoring of
programmes. But they also helped finance 11 projects last year. This
involvement helps explain why critics of the Bretton Woods institutions
divide into a radical wing, such as the '50 years is enough campaign.'
They want to curtail the activities of the two organisations and more
moderate groups which hope to change their practices.
The influence of the NGOs has been increasingly apparent over the past
decade, with the Bank paying more regard to the environment and putting
greater emphasis on combating poverty.
On the evidence of this week's meeting in Madrid, their influence looks set
to grow as the IMF and the World Bank embark on their second half century.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Oxfam urges big change at World Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Big changes in the approach of the International Monetary Fund and World
Bank towards Latin America were urged by the British-based aid organisation
Oxfam in Madrid yesterday.
After four successive years of economic growth, Latin America has come to be
regarded as a success story for the market-oriented policies urged by
Washington-based organisations. But, in yesterday's report, Oxfam said Latin
America's free-market revolution has only widened already extreme income
inequalities and worsened poverty.
Oxfam welcomes the World Bank's recent commitment to poverty reduction 'but
remains concerned that the strategy adopted is essentially a repackaging of
the IMF and World Bank's policies, with social investment and safety nets
added on'.
According to the charity, the new policies' main flaws are that they fail to
introduce policies for wealth distribution, and do nothing to protect what
it calls basic rights, a lack of which has resulted in low-wage precarious
jobs, unequal land distribution, restricted access to capital, and
inadequate health and education.
It says IMF stabilisation policies and World Bank insistence on market
deregulation, import liberalisation and export growth have undermined any
anti-poverty strategy. Growth was also based on the dismantling of workers'
rights and the erosion of wages, which would further worsen economic
insecurity.
Its central recommendation is for the two institutions to replace their
current single policy blueprint with a country-by-country reform strategy
based on dialogue with local civil organisations, governments and relevant
UN agencies.
It favours selective trade protection and 'carefully targeted' subsidies for
key industries, as well as low real interest rates. It also calls for social
clauses in international trade and investment agreements 'to reverse the
current trend towards low-wage export strategies'.
Land reform should be a central element of the World Bank's poverty
reduction strategy.
Further, it says foreign debt is still draining many Latin American
countries of resources. The Brady plan, though welcome, had been biased
towards big debtors, and had failed to restore their long-term financial
stability. Meanwhile debt to multilateral agencies such as the World Bank
has become an increasing part of the problem, rising from 5 per cent of the
regional debt stock in 1980 to 28 per cent in 1992.
It urges quick implementation of the British government's proposal to use
IMF gold stocks for debt relief for very poor countries, and says debt
relief should be separated from IMF reform packages. The World Bank, it
argues, should use its Dollars 17bn (Pounds 11.3bn) in reserves for
selective debt relief; efforts to reduce countries' commercial debts should
be renewed.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Ukraine agrees to far-reaching economic reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's preliminary agreement for the International Monetary Fund to
provide Ukraine with Dollars 360m of financing from its systemic
transformation facility (STF) is contingent on the Kiev government
implementing a potentially far reaching economic reform programme.
Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director said, it was a 'strong first
step' in the direction of macroeconomic stabilisation.
Considerably more financial assistance will be available next year, with the
IMF hoping to negotiate a stand-by credit early in 1995. But while Mr
Camdessus and Mr Oleh Havrylyshyn, Ukraine's alternate executive director at
the IMF, expressed the hope that western governments would provide bilateral
support for Ukraine, British officials indicated that there are no plans at
present for such a move.
Mr Havrylyshyn said Ukraine hopes to obtain the Dollars 360m before the end
of October after approval by the IMF board. It hopes to have the Dollars 4bn
of support envisaged at the Naples summit by the G7 leading industrial
countries by the end of 1995.
Although there is likely to be some increase in inflation over the rest of
this year as a result of financing arrangements for the farm sector, Ukraine
has promised to have its monthly inflation in single digits for the rest of
this year and 'low single digits' for the whole of 1995, Mr Havrylyshyn
said.
He said Ukraine also promised to keep its budget deficit down to 10.5 per
cent of gross domestic product in the third and fourth quarters. Without
action to cut spending, the deficit would rise to 20 per cent from around 10
per cent in the first half of the year because of the commitments to finance
agriculture. The aim is to bring the deficit substantially below 10 per cent
next year.
The government will make some cuts in social spending that will hit the
middle classes. It also plans subsidy cuts.
It plans to start privatising state-run companies, starting on a small scale
early in 1995.
An important part of the plan will be the liberalisation of foreign exchange
arrangements, creating a genuine foreign exchange market around the end of
this year. The Kiev government hopes this will stabilise the Ukraine coupon
currency, which is currently worth around 75,000 to the dollar.
He said Kiev expects the IMF should provide about Dollars 1.5bn through its
STF and stand-by arrangements. The World Bank is expected to provide Dollars
400m while the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is
also expected to provide funds. That would leave about Dollars 1.5bn to be
provided by other lenders, such as western governments, Mr Havrylyshyn said.
However, senior UK Treasury officials disputed this breakdown. They said the
Dollars 4bn discussed at Naples would be supplied by the international
financial institutions.
If so illustrative G7 figures suggested Ukraine could hope to draw around
Dollars 1.2bn from the STF, Dollars 1.4bn through an IMF stand-by, about
Dollars 1.2bn from the Bank and Dollars 300m from EBRD.

<TEXT>
The plan of Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor of the exchequer, to sell some
of the International Monetary Fund's gold to help ease some poor developing
nations' debt burden had a cool reception from Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF
managing director, yesterday.
He did not reject the idea but said all other instruments should be
considered before disposing of the Fund's 'family jewels'. The IMF's 103.4m
fine ounces of gold, worth Dollars 40bn, was being put to good use by the
Fund, he declared.
It was used to guarantee the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF)
which had provided support to 26 poor developing countries on concessional
terms. The IMF had also pledged 3m oz in support of a programme to help
countries in arrears with the IMF regain the ability to borrow from the
fund. Peru and Sierra Leone were among countries that had benefited.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Kono is all tact after UN talk: Jurek Martin tries to pin
down Japanese foreign minister's agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are two ways to read the speech that Mr Yohei Kono, Japan's foreign
minister, delivered to the United Nations general assembly on the subject of
his country's membership of an enlarged Security Council.
The first is to conclude that Japan is putting the world on notice that it
expects its contributions to the UN finally to be recognised with a Security
Council seat by the end of next year at the latest. The second is that
Japan's time-frame is nothing like as tight.
Interviewed by a small group of correspondents from western newspapers in
the offices of the Japanese mission to the UN, Mr Kono made no threats, but
exuded a quiet insistence that the time had come. 'I think it is inevitable
the time is needed for any agreement in an organisation with so large a
membership,' he said.
'My speech reflected Japanese mentality,' he added about the address on
Tuesday. 'It is more convenient, better, to think in round figures, like 50
or 100.' Next year is the 50th anniversary of the UN, thus it was 'a logical
objective'. However, he declared, there was no setting of a firm deadline.
He was not specific about how big an expanded Security Council might be,
settling, vaguely, at 'around 20 countries', and declined to identify who
they might be.
He also ducked the obvious question as to whether the power of veto should
be extended beyond that possessed by the current permanent five - the US,
Russia, Britain, France and China. 'That will require a lot of discussion.'
But he then made the argument that possession of nuclear weapons should not
be the only criterion. 'It is important to have countries with a non-nuclear
frame of mind' on the Council, for the simple reason that international
security could no longer be defined exclusively in military terms.
'Today, the UN is expected to play all sorts of roles,' he argued, listing
the environment, development, refugees, disaster relief and nuclear
non-proliferation. Permanent members 'should have experience and other
capabilities' on which the existing five members do not have a monopoly.
Mr Kono agreed that the change in government in Tokyo had altered Japan's
approach to membership, with the clear divisions that marked the coalition
headed by Mr Morohiro Hosokawa now replaced by a consistent view.
There might still be reservations in the Social Democratic and Buddhist
parties, he said, 'but within the cabinet there is agreement behind this new
push'.
The foreign minister also diplomatically declined an invitation to say
whether Japan would support a second term for Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the
UN secretary-general. It was 'too early' to assess his performance or
contemplate the succession. But, clearly aware that the secretary-general
will be an important player in UN reform, Mr Kono noted how hard Mr Boutros
Ghali had worked to improve relations between the UN and Japan, and with
Asia in general.
Mr Kono was careful not to give the impression that Japan was consciously
leading an Asian movement for greater influence in the UN. Asian growth had
been 'breathtaking', with many nations now 'more confident' and ready to
speak out on a wide variety of issues. But some were 'still mired in
poverty'.
But with Japan contributing 12 per cent of the UN budget, and with the
world's largest development aid budget, Mr Kono thinks his country's case
for membership now stands on its own merit.

US negotiators admitted last night that little progress had been made in the
latest round of high-level talks with North Korea on Pyongyang's suspect
nuclear programme, writes Frances Williams in Geneva.
Mr Robert Gallucci, chief US negotiator, and Mr Kang Sok-ju, North Korea's
first deputy foreign minister, plan to meet again on Tuesday, according to
North Korean officials. Mr Gallucci said only that he would meet Mr Kang
again next week.
Technical experts will stay in Geneva to continue the week-long talks, which
centre on a US offer to help North Korea switch from graphite-moderated to
light-water reactors, which produce less plutonium. Among the sticking
points are a North Korean demand for hefty compensation to abandon its
current reactor programme.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Industry output bounces back in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's industrial output bounced back a higher-than-expected 3.6 per cent
from July to August, confirming that production is settling into a gently
rising trend.
The turn-round, from a 1.7 per cent decline in July, means output is set to
rise by a 1.9 per cent from the second to the third quarters of this year,
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry forecast.
That would be the third consecutive quarter-on-quarter rise of this
important measure of economic activity, representing nearly a third of
Japan's GNP.
Miti expects output, often volatile, to fall in the next two months, as
manufacturers hold back after an unusually strong August.
But the trend of average production in the first nine months of this year is
0.5 per cent above the same period of 1993, Mr Bick Beason, senior economist
at James Capel Pacific estimated.
Stocks of unsold goods were flat last month, by comparison with July, but
fell 7.1 per cent over the year, prompting Miti to predict that inventory
adjustments would soon be completed.
Evidence that some industrial sectors are gearing up for a recovery in
demand came yesterday with a survey showing that producers of machinery will
increase their capital spending by 3.2 per cent in the year to next March,
the first rise for three years.
This is led by semiconductor and liquid crystal display producers, which
plan a 16.6 per cent rise in investment this year, responding to the growth
in demand for personal computers, the Japan Machinery Federation said.
Carmakers expect the second biggest sector rise in machinery spending, 2.4
per cent this year, according to a federation survey of its members.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Refugees carry plague across India: New Delhi shuts schools
and cinemas as cases soar to 1,800
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The authorities in New Delhi yesterday closed schools and cinemas as plague
claimed more victims in the city and northern, western and eastern India.
The closures were the most serious precaution taken so far outside the
epicentres of the disease in the western city of Surat, where pneumonic
plague broke out last month, and in rural eastern Maharashtra, which was hit
by bubonic plague last month.
The Delhi authorities' action indicates the gravity with which Indian
officials are treating the outbreak, even as they are trying to calm fears
in the country and abroad. Mr Madan Lal Khurana, the city's chief minister,
said the measures were a precaution and there was no need to panic.
Schools are to close until October 15, and cinemas indefinitely.
The number of suspected cases increased by about 400 yesterday to just under
1,800, mostly in and around Surat and in eastern Maharashtra, according to
the government's National Institute of Communicable Diseases.
The plague has also been spread to other places by a flood of people who
fled Surat last week.
Delhi yesterday reported 61 suspected cases, an increase of 30, and Bombay,
the commercial capital, 69, up from 51. Officials are puzzled by the
relatively low figure for Bombay, which lies close to Surat and where many
of those fleeing Surat sought refuge.
A handful of cases have also been reported in the tourist state of
Rajasthan. In Calcutta, about 50 suspected plague victims were found to have
been suffering from other diseases. The death toll remained unchanged at a
revised figure of 46.
Except in Surat, where the exodus of 300,000-plus people has left many
streets, shops and factories deserted, life in the big cities continues as
normal. Apart from sweeping antibiotics off chemist shop shelves, people
have shown no signs of panic. Municipal councils have increased efforts to
clean away rubbish.
Meanwhile, foreign countries - notably India's neighbours - increased their
precautions.
Pakistan sealed all air, land and rail routes to India. The Gulf states,
which had earlier banned flights, yesterday closed their ports to ships from
India. Bangladesh is cancelling flights from India from today.
European states and the US are screening travellers arriving from India. In
the strictest travel warning issued by a western country, France has advised
its nationals not to go to India unless necessary.
Mitsui, the Japanese trading company, is repatriating the families of its
India-based executives. Indian health officials insisted the plague was
under control and accused some foreign countries, especially the Gulf
states, of over-reacting.
The government in Delhi called a meeting tomorrow of health officials from
all state administrations to work out a comprehensive anti-plague strategy.
Dr N K Shah, the World Health Organisation's representative in India, said
India should be free of the epidemic in two or three weeks.
Travel industry executives expressed concern that the plague was starting to
affect trade, particularly package tours. However, hotels said very few
business travellers were cancelling trips.
India attracted 1.86m foreign tourists in the year ending March 1994, and
expected 2.2m this year.

FT  30 SEP 94 / OECD in race against time to fill top job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The clock ran out last night on the tenure of Mr Jean-Claude Paye as
secretary general of the 25-nation Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD) without member countries' ambassadors being able to
agree that either he or a rival US-backed Canadian candidate should be named
to a full new term.
After eight hours of talks yesterday and on Wednesday failed to break the
deadlock - essentially between France and the US - OECD envoys headed into a
further late-night meeting, aimed simply at agreeing on a caretaker head of
the organisation.
Mr Paye, whose second five-year term came to an end at midnight, has two
deputies - one American and one Swede - who could fill that caretaker role,
until such time as the international economic think-tank chooses to restart
the competition for its top job.
But France has been determined to keep Mr Paye on, even on an interim basis,
on the ground that the French incumbent had majority support within the
organisation's 25 members, who are mainly European.
Late yesterday, however, the US was still adamant that it would not accept
Mr Paye staying on, even as a temporary caretaker, arguing that 10 years was
enough and that it was time for the organisation to have a non-European
head.
It has strongly backed Mr Donald Johnston, a former Canadian minister, who
also has the support of his own government and some other non-European
countries such as Australia and New Zealand.
Short of a major climb-down by Paris or Washington, it is increasingly
likely that both Mr Paye and Mr Johnston will have to withdraw, having
effectively cancelled each other out. This would leave Lord Lawson, former
UK chancellor of the exchequer, as the only declared candidate left in the
field. But since his support was largely confined to the UK government,
others would probably throw their hats into the ring.
Meanwhile, one side-effect of the OECD impasse was that the Paris-based
International Energy Agency yesterday named a new director, but only on an
acting basis.
Mr John Ferriter is to take over as interim executive director of the IEA
from Ms Helga Steeg, who is retiring after 10 years at the agency. The IEA
seeks to co-ordinate energy policy among member countries, which largely
overlap with the OECD. Some of them, notably France and the US, appear to be
using the definitive choice of an IEA director as a weapon in the battle
over the secretary-generalship of the older and more prestigious OECD.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Australian deficit leaps to ADollars 2.1bn

<TEXT>
Australia's current account deficit, seasonally adjusted, surged to ADollars
2.14bn (Pounds 1bn) in August, the largest figure since the beginning of
1990 and far in excess of market forecasts, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney.
The revised July deficit figure stood at ADollars 1.81bn, and most analysts
had been predicting a similar figure for the following month. Although many
of Australia's economic indicators have looked healthy in recent months,
there has been persistent concern that the country could experience a
'blowout' on the balance of payments front.
Merchandise exports rose by 2 per cent, or ADollars 123m, although non-rural
exports were below the level recorded in 10 of 12 months of the 1993/4
fiscal year. This rise, however, was more than outweighed by a 7 per cent
increase, amounting to ADollars 412m, in merchandise imports.
Government ministers played down the figures' significance. Mr Kim Beazley,
finance minister, said 'monthly volatility in the data should be treated
with caution'. Mr Paul Keating, prime minister, admitted the deficit was
'higher than we would like', but also warned about reading too much into one
month's statistics. Both denied the balance of payments figures would put
pressure on the federal budget, or immediately influence monetary policy.
However, the Australian dollar came under selling pressure, and closed at
Dollars 0.73825, compared with the previous close of Dollars 0.73985. The
long bond yield hit a three-year peak, but steadied later.
Meanwhile, Mr Alexander Downer, leader of the coalition opposition, warned
the effects of drought could compound a surge in capital investment-related
imports.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Host of constraints hinder Egypt: World Bank study seeks
agenda for regenerating the private sector - A report urging the creation of
5m jobs by 2000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A host of embedded legal, regulatory, tax, financial, bureaucratic and
judicial constraints are impeding the growth of Egypt's private sector,
despite 'remarkable results' in the country's macro-economic reform
programmes, an exhaustive World Bank study* designed to create a sweeping
agenda for private-sector regeneration says.
The report, the most detailed to be prepared on Egypt's private sector, is
an attempt to explain why private investment has failed to respond to almost
three years of largely successful International Monetary Fund and World
Bank-guided stabilisation policies.
It underlines the urgency of the task by estimating that the private sector
must create 5m jobs by the year 2000 even to halve the present 20 per cent
unemployment rate, given present population growth of more than 2 per cent.
Even moderate GDP growth of about 3.5 per cent a year would require a real
doubling in levels of private investment between now and 2000, the report
says.
The bulk of prospective new jobs would most likely come from small private
companies employing fewer than nine workers, which comprise 99 per cent of
the country's non-agricultural private-sector enterprises.
But these lack access to credit, physical space and markets, are largely
ignored by economic policy-makers and often prefer to remain small to avoid
contact with cumbersome tax, legal and other bureaucratic restraints.
The 'rigid regulatory environment' of the socialist 1960s under President
Gamal Nasser 'pushed a large sector of private enterprise into informality
and engendered reluctance to graduate out of it,' while government
incentives have been heavily biased towards big domestic and international
investors.
'The result was a private sector with distinct polarity and weak linkages.'
The report identifies a raft of constraints on the private sector as a whole
including:
Lack of clarity and open information on progress in liberalising the
economy, breeding uncertainty among prospective investors;
Complex and restrictive labour laws, along with a lack of adequate
anti-trust, consumer protection and trade legislation;
Complex and prohibitive regulations on corporate approval and licensing;
Generally inefficient and poor-calibre public institutions.
Time-consuming and expensive commercial judicial practices dating from 'a
planned socialist economy where private commercial disputes were not the
norm';
Inadequate sources of credit for small and medium-sized businesses and a
scarcity of adequately educated workers, particularly of management calibre;
cumbersome and time-consuming tax administration.
These constraints are 'closely inter-related and crucial in toto,' adding
that piecemeal efforts to relax them might still not bring about a
flourishing private sector. 'The real overall constraint to Egypt's private
sector is the lack of an appropriate business environment.'
To all this, the report adds the need for the government to expand and
accelerate its privatisation programme, noting that 'in the two years since
the privatisation programme started, no actual transfer of controlling
ownership has taken place,' while more aggressively seeking foreign
investment and stimulating private manufacturing exports.
On the latter, it states that non-oil merchandise exports have been
declining continuously for a decade and are at just a third of their level
in 1983 at current dollar values.
Such exports would have to more than double between now and the year 2000 to
keep the balance-of-payments deficit to below 5 per cent of GDP.
Given its wide-ranging findings, the report states perhaps with
understatement that 'more than three decades of central planning call for a
good degree of realism in the setting of Egypt's market-driven development
targets', calling private-sector development a formidable task.
The authors hope the report will concentrate government and Egyptian
business minds on the topic, which they say is of paramount importance in
securing real gains from the reform programme.
The document is to be the centrepiece of a two-day conference in Cairo next
week, gathering the bank, the government and leading Egyptian businessmen in
an attempt to create an 'agenda for action'.

Five members of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's Labour party
yesterday put a timebomb under his plans for a peace accord with Syria, by
tabling a bill that, if passed, would require him to win an almost
impossible parliamentary majority for withdrawal from the Golan Heights.
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said the five were making 'a fatal mistake'
that could cause the collapse of the peace process.
Mr Rabin had warned on Wednesday that, if the bill were passed, 'I would
have no choice but to tell the Americans it is impossible to pursue
negotiations with Syria.'

Australia's current account deficit, seasonally adjusted, surged to ADollars
2.14bn (Pounds 1bn) in August, the largest figure since the beginning of
1990 and way in excess of market forecasts.
The revised July deficit figure stood at ADollars 1.81bn, and most analysts

Government ministers immediately played down the significance of yesterday's

in imports of a few very costly unusual items that occured in August.
However, Mr Paul Keating, prime minister, admitted the deficit was 'higher

Meanwhile, Mr Alexander Downer, leader of the coalition opposition, warned
that the effects of the severe drought, which has hit key east coast
agricultural areas and is expected to hinder rural exports, had yet to be
felt, and could compound a surge in capital investment-related imports.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Paris-based International Energy Agency yesterday named a new director,
but only on an acting basis partly because of the continued deadlock over a
new head for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
Mr John Ferriter is to take over as interim executive director of the IEA
from Ms Helga Steeg, retiring after 10 years at the agency which seeks to
co-ordinate energy policy among some 23 industrialised, oil-consuming
countries. These countries all belong to the OECD, and some, notably France
and the US, appear to be using the final choice of IEA director as a weapon
in their battle for the secretary-generalship of the older and more
prestigious OECD.
Ambassadors of the OECD countries, which group IEA members plus Mexico and
Iceland, were yesterday holding another crisis meeting, apparently to try to
arrange a temporary manager of the institution after the term of Mr
Jean-Claude Paye, the current French secretary general ends tomorrow
In four hours of talks on Wednesday, they failed to reach a decision between
the rival candidacies of Mr Paye, supported by France and a number of
European countries, of Mr Donald Johnston, a former Canadian minister
strongly backed by the US and some non-European members of OECD, and of Lord
Lawson, former UK chancellor, whose backing lies mainly with his own
country.
Mr Paye's supporters claim majority support for their man who has held the
OECD post for the past 10 years - though not apparently the Netherlands -
behind him the Frenchman deservers to continue in the post he had held for
10 years.
But the US and Canada are effectively vetoing Mr Paye on the grounds the
OECD should have a non-European head for the first time in its history. Such
is the deadlock it is possible both Mr Paye and Mr Johnston may have to
withdraw.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Campaigning for Brazil's presidential elections closes today, with polls
suggesting Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, former finance minister, will win
Monday's first round and avoid a run off, writes Angus Foster in Sao Paulo.
According to a Datafolha poll published yesterday, Mr Cardoso has 47 per
cent of support, unchanged on a week ago. This compared to 23 per cent for
his nearest rival, Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Other candidates had a
combined vote of 16 per cent. Mr Cardoso will win outright if he polls more
votes than his competitors combined. If not, there is a run off in November.
Yesterday's poll also showed Mr Cardoso's support among poorer voters is
continuing to grow. This largely stems from an anti-inflation plan he
launched when finance minister, which brought monthly inflation rates of
nearly 50 per cent down to 1.51 per cent for the four weeks to
mid-September, according to the government's official index.

FT  30 SEP 94 / CIA chief rebuts allegations over 'mole': Woolsey's handling
of spy scandal raises doubts over his leadership
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr James Woolsey, head of the CIA, yesterday rebutted charges that
disciplinary action he had taken in the wake of the Aldrich Ames affair was
grossly inadequate, writes Jurek Martin in Washington.
Ames is a confessed 'mole' for the former Soviet Union whose action, a CIA
report has confirmed, undermined at least 55, and possibly more, US covert
operations in the mid-1980s. Ten US agents - all citizens of the Soviet
Union - were executed.
In a sharp TV exchange with Senator Dennis DeConcini, the Republican from
Arizona and a leading critic of the CIA, Mr Woolsey said letters of
reprimand sent to 11 present and former officials did not constitute
'business as usual'.
Mr DeConcini conceded there was little Mr Woolsey could do about the seven
retired CIA employees found negligent in their supervision of Ames.
But, the senator went on, 'some of them are still there, running (espionage)
operat-ions. And what do they get? They get a letter. Now I don't want
somebody's scalp or something. What I want is change out there.'
Mr Woolsey testified later to a secret session of the Senate intelligence
committee. But, in several interviews, he was adamant he had gone through
each case 'individually and fairly, acting somewhat like a judge'. He had no
apologies for retaining Mr Hugh 'Ted' Price as deputy director of
operations, even though he was one of the serving officers receiving a
letter of reprimand. Mr Woolsey said Mr Price had only been tangentially
involved for a short period and was critical to efforts to reform the
agency.
But he also said a junior CIA official who had tried unsuccessfully to bring
Ames's activities to the attention of superiors was being commended and
promoted to serve as his own special assistant.
Even though Ames did his damage before Mr Woolsey took over the CIA with the
onset of the Clinton administration, his handling of the matter has raised
questions in Washington about his own position. In an interview on Wednesday
he said he had no intention of stepping down, merely observing that 'some
days are longer than others'.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Stability an imperative after Mexican assassination:
Bringing killers to justice will test new president's resolve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TED BARDACKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The scene at the headquarters of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary
party (PRI) was sadly familiar. President-elect Ernesto Zedillo, dressed in
a black suit, stood next to the coffin of a slain party leader while the
crowd that had gathered to mourn chanted 'justice, justice, justice'.
Six months ago it was the body of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, a presidential
candidate, that lay in state. Justice in his assassination has not yet been
served, nor is it likely to be. On Wednesday the assassination victim was Mr
Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the PRI secretary-general. Bringing his killers
to justice will be one of the first tests of Mr Zedillo's promise of
profound reform of Mexico's political and judicial system when he becomes
president on December 1.
Although Mr Ruiz was a central player in Mr Zedillo's still ambiguous
proposal for political reform, it was clear he was taking orders from the
president-elect rather than giving them. The Mexican political system has a
great reserve of talent and although Mr Ruiz had a flair that will be
difficult to replace, he will be replaced nonetheless.
Investors seem to believe this and are showing a combination of political
understanding and blind faith. After falling nearly 3 per cent on news of
the killing, the stock market rebounded, as did the Mexican peso, the latter
with apparent heavy central bank help. 'The market is going to shake this
off. The foreigners are showing remarkable restraint,' said Mr Timothy
Heyman of Baring Securities.
But if confidence is to remain high and economic growth to take off, the
country cannot afford to hold funeral wakes at PRI headquarters every six
months. The morning after the killing, the nation's papers were full of
editorials warning that if violence becomes the way of resolving political
disputes then the country is in for tough times.
Mr Zedillo's advisers say that he understands something must be done to halt
the killings, adding that the trauma it produced shows that Mexicans are not
yet prepared to take politically motivated violence as the norm.
'If anything, this makes him more committed to reform,' said one party
insider at Wednesday evening's memorial ceremony. But he added: 'Zedillo is
a tough man, but I'm not sure how many more of these things he can take
before his nerves start to fray.'
Indeed, the temptation to crack down on, rather than open up, the system may
become hard to resist. Most observers believe the PRI was re-elected because
voters wanted stability more than change. Some within the ruling party are
sure to argue that further reform will only expose the country and the
president to more political shocks.
If Mr Ruiz's killing was designed to send a message about the dangers of
reform - as many are already suggesting - it could be a very effective
message.
Others, including government officials, are suggesting a different motive
for the assassination: drugs. Mr Ruiz's brother, Mr Mario Ruiz Massieu, is
Mexico's assistant attorney-general in charge of the anti-drug fight.
In recent months Mario has presided over several high-profile crackdowns on
the country's two most powerful drug cartels. Two other brothers of
Francisco and Mario were killed in an unsolved attack in Guerrero state,
where Francisco was governor, a number of years ago.
Police arrested a man from Guerrero, named as Hector Resendiz, close to the
scene on Wednesday. Government officials said the assailant appeared to be a
hit-man as he was carrying an Uzi sub-machinegun.
The drug cartels have shown a shocking capacity to undermine and destabilise
the country when politicians get in their way. The three most highly
publicised, and unresolved, killings of political figures in the past 18
months - of Cardinal Juan Posadas Ocampo in Guadalajara, Mr Colosio and
police chief Jose Benitez in Tijuana - have been either officially or
unofficially attributed to drug traffickers.
Finding the traffickers responsible for the assassination and taking strong
action against them would be a convenient way to justify some repression
without derailing overall political reform. But it also carries political
risks, as well as the threat of more violence. It would mean taking on the
drug monster that has penetrated most aspects of Mexican society, including
the political system.
There is a widespread belief in Mexican society that taking on the drug
cartels would also involve taking on certain parts of the PRI and the
government. Opening up that Pandora's box would also mean having to
improvise political reform. Mr Zedillo has pledged to change the country,
but he also wants to stay in control.
When the Mexican government announced last week that it would follow a
restrictive economic policy during the first year of the Zedillo
administration, many took it as a sign that initially the new president was
going to concentrate on restoring stability through political reform rather
than economic growth.
Now stability appears even more imperative. As one foreign observer said:
'If you don't have growth and you don't have stability, then you don't have
anything.'

FT  30 SEP 94 / Grenade attack kills four Haitians
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A grenade attack on a pro-democracy march in Port-au-Prince yesterday -
which left at least four dead and up to 40 injured - threatened to
destabilise the Haitian capital on the eve of a huge demonstration expected
today.
It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the attack, the most
violent incident since US troops arrived in the country. It came after US
and Haitian authorities staged the symbolic return of elected mayor Evans
Paul to the Port-au-Prince town hall.
Mr Paul had been in hiding for nearly a year. People gathered in the
streets, chanting slogans demanding the arrest of Haiti's military leaders
and calling for the return of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who
is still in the US.
The celebration was thrown into chaos when the grenade was tossed into the
crowd. The incident, which was followed by another reported attack, this
time a shooting, set off a wave of looting.
The US army immediately stepped up its deployment, sending in Sheraton tanks
and Bradley armoured vehicles. Troops shot their way into a warehouse in an
attempt to secure the area.
Mr William Swing, US ambassador in Haiti, said that 'brutal acts of violence
are not totally unexpected. . . because the enemies of democracy will resort
to any ends and means to stop the democratic change process.'
Even before the attacks, tension was expected today as thousands of Haitians
are due to march through the streets of Port-au-Prince to show support for
Mr Aristide on the third anniversary of the coup that ousted him from
office.
The United Nations Security Council voted last night to lift fuel, trade and
arms sanctions against Haiti, beginning the morning after President Aristide
returns from exile. The vote was 13-0, with Russia and Brazil abstaining.

FT  30 SEP 94 / US telecoms groups puzzle over the future: Accusations fly
as legislation to overhaul the industry collapses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Telecommunications executives and regulators alike are puzzling over what
will happen to their industry now that efforts to pass the first substantial
overhaul of US telecommunications law in 60 years have been declared dead
for the year, write Tony Jackson and George Graham.
Legislation died in Congress last week when Senator Fritz Hollings, who as
chairman of the Senate commerce committee holds sway over the measure,
announced he had given up trying to bring the bill to a vote.
Senator Hollings blamed the 'Baby Bells,' the regional telephone companies
created by the court-ordered break-up of the old AT&amp;T telephone monopoly 10
years ago, for their hostility to the bill, despite a string of concessions
to their demands.
Industry and stock market reaction to the collapse of the bill, likewise,
accused the Bell companies of short-sightedness; anxious to protect their
local monopolies, they have obstructed change and denied themselves growth
opportunities in long-distance and equipment manufacture. The long-distance
telephone companies such as AT&amp;T and MCI, are seen as the winners, as the
Baby Bells and other regional companies now will not be allowed into the
long-distance market.
The Bells meanwhile hotly deny responsibility, pointing the finger at
Senator Robert Dole, the Republican minority leader, who has done his utmost
to block a series of bills that might give the Clinton administration some
claim of legislative accomplishment.
In fact, a number of Bell chief executives were in Senator Dole's office in
an attempt to persuade him to soften his demands at the moment that Senator
Hollings announced his withdrawal of the bill.
Even if the Senate had passed Senator Hollings's bill, it would not have
been easy to reconcile it with the very different philosophy of the bills
already passed by the House of Representatives - which set up a framework
but leave much more of the detail to be worked out in regulatory decisions
by the Federal Communications Commission.
In many ways, however, the reshaping of the US telecoms industry goes on
regardless of events on Capitol Hill. Industry analysts claim the whole
industry's investment plans will be put on hold. The Clinton
administration's grandiose vision of a national information infrastructure,
or superhighway, depends heavily on private sector finance. Without the
agreed regulatory framework promised by the bill, the private sector may
prove reluctant to risk the money.
But some of this seems exaggerated. 'The technology, the plant and the
software for the digital superhighway are years away anyway,' argues Mr
George Dellinger of NatWest Washington Analysis. 'This is not a particular
setback to the level of investment.'
This seems borne out by the recent behaviour of the companies themselves,
whose investment plans seem more concerned with acquisitions and strategic
alliances.
As for the theory that the long-distance companies profit from the bill's
collapse, it is worth recalling that the long-distance companies supported
the bill while the Bells opposed it. For the long-distance operators, the
bill's attraction lay in requiring the Bell companies to relax their local
monopolies.
Since a huge chunk of the long-distance companies' revenues are consumed in
access fees to the local networks, the promise of competition and lower fees
at the local level evidently outweighed the threat of competition in their
own markets.
The bill would have allowed the Bell companies into three key areas -
long-distance telephony, equipment manufacture and cable TV. But it would
have weakened their local monopolies in return: and with their cash flow in
that business - by one industry estimate - equal to 42 per cent of turnover,
the long-term opportunity was outweighed by the short-term cost.
Instead, the regional companies are looking to the courts, in the hope of
getting what they want on easier terms. In one important court case they are
seeking jointly to overturn the provisions of the original AT&amp;T break-up, on
the grounds that they are anti-competitive and out of date. If successful -
and the case could take 18 months to be resolved - this would allow them
into long-distance telephony and equipment manufacture. At the same time
almost all the Bells have suits under way in local courts seeking to
overturn the separate legislation which excludes telephone companies from
cable TV.
Meanwhile, the mobile telephone revolution continues apace. Last week's
final clearance of the AT&amp;T/McCaw merger is widely seen as reinstating -
under competitive conditions - the old nationwide telephone system broken up
a decade ago. By using McCaw's local cellular networks, AT&amp;T can, to an
extent, simply bypass the local telephone system and provide its customers
with a combined local and long-distance service.
All the while the battle over regional telephone monopolies goes on. On
Tuesday the New York telephone company Nynex put forward a proposal to
freeze its residential call rates for five years, provided it is allowed to
make as much profit as it can in return.
This provoked a storm of criticism from the long-distance and cable
companies. The proposal, said AT&amp;T, was 'Nynex's Trojan horse strategy for
strengthening monopoly control'. It was, said the Cable Television
Association of New York, 'so one-sided in favour of Nynex that it would
deter any investment in New York state by other companies'.
The industry will undoubtedly continue to transform itself, but all sides
agree it would be quicker and cleaner to try again to produce comprehensive
legislation when a new Congress meets next year.
That may not be easy. Some of the deals that have been struck to ease the
passage of legislation this year might survive, but compromises on
long-distance telephone service and cable television will have to be worked
out again from scratch.

FT  30 SEP 94 / UN asked to rethink sanctions on Haiti
</HEADLINE>

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Secretary of State Warren Christopher yesterday asked the United Nations
Security Council to lift all remaining sanctions against Haiti as soon as
ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide has returned to his country.
Mr Christopher voiced 'cautious optimism' over the political developments in
Haiti since a US force landed two weeks ago.
Although other Security Council members have shown some reluctance to lift
the UN sanctions until Haiti's military leaders step down, US officials said
the council might vote on the resolution as early as yesterday afternoon.
In Port-au-Prince, the US military began taking over responsibility for
civilian utilities and infrastructure. The lights were expected to come on
in a number of districts last night as the US brought two of the city's
thermal electricity plants back into operation.
US officials yesterday also predicted that the multinational operation in
Haiti would look to rejuvenate water supply, trunk roads and
telecommunications.
Until yesterday, the city had only 13MW of electricity after dark, and 26MW
during the day. But the US army has provided engineers to restore the
Carrefour and Varreuf petrol-fired plant, shut down as a result of the fuel
embargo. This should bring the energy supply to over 50MW.
Although army officers were celebrating the achievements yesterday, they
insisted that US support was temporary.
Officials would not say how long the US would provide fuel and technical
assistance, nor how the programme would be financed. They expressed hope,
however, that Haiti would resume responsibiliy for the grid as soon as
possible.
Mr Evans Paul, the mayor who was forced into hiding, was reinstalled in the
town hall yesterday.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Berlusconi decides to go for broke: After failing to placate
the unions, Italy's prime minister has opted for a more austere budget.
Business leaders can hardly believe it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Confindustria, the Italian industrialists' confederation, held back for a
day in judging the Berlusconi government's 1995 budget for fear of appearing
over-enthusiastic.
But yesterday all reserve was removed. 'I scarcely believe that this
government has dared do what no one else has dared to do - structural cuts
in the pensions and health systems,' commented Mr Stefano Micossi, head of
research at Confindustria.
In stark contrast the unions have called a general strike for October 14 to
protest against the budget's 'unfair and unacceptable' attack on pensions
and health benefits. Already localised stoppages have been staged in major
cities.
The difference between these two positions is not surprising. On Tuesday in
the final stages of preparing the budget the right-wing coalition changed
tactics. Sensing the unions could not be placated, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the
prime minister, accepted the tough line advocated by the treasury. As a
result the austerity measures acquired more teeth and the structural
adjustments affecting Italy's chronic budget deficits became more
significant.
The government is committed to finding L29,000bn (Pounds 11.8bn) through
spending cuts and extra revenues, so reducing the budget deficit by almost 2
percentage points to 8 per cent of GDP. The increase in public spending is
being held to the projected inflation rate of 2.5 per cent a year.
The burden of these adjustments will not fall evenly, and future pensioners,
especially in the public sector, will lose out. At the same time the core of
the fiscal measures pander directly to Mr Berlusconi's electorate -
rewarding those who have built property without proper planning permission
and those with tax assessment disputes. Last week the government made the
terms of the building amnesty even more attractive to encourage people to
register their properties (and hence provide registration revenue).
In the case of tax assessments, a backlog of over 1m disputed cases can now
be eliminated with the payment of often less than 10 per cent of the amount
in dispute. This is an effective tax amnesty. These two 'amnesties' are due
to raise two thirds of extra fiscal receipts. Other revenues will come from
reducing the tax privileges of co-operatives; tightening tax evasion and
imposing a minimum tax on shelf companies.
The government could not duck the generous pay-as-you-go state pensions
system. If unchecked the treasury funding of the pensions deficit would have
risen 11 per cent to L94,000bn in 1995. The measures in the budget will
reduce the rise in pensions transfers to 3.5 per cent. This will be achieved
by accelerating the pace at which the retirement age is raised from 56 to 60
for women and 61 to 65 for men; by harmonising the rate at which pensions
accrue annually at 2 per cent next year and lowering this to 1.75 per cent
thereafter; and by penalising early retirement. Also all pension requests
will be blocked for four months and throughout 1995 indexation payments will
be frozen.
The bulk of the other cuts come from the health system with the closure or
sale of small hospitals, further reductions in the availability of free
prescriptions, and a hefty cut in procurement contracts. The budget
encourages privatisation of healthcare as well as increased use of private
pension funds.
The government's axe will be felt in every ministry, not least defence where
the L1,000bn pruning risks seriously impairing Italy's pretentions to
upgrade its military hardware to play a more active international role. In
the civil service new hiring has been frozen and productivity pay bonuses
are being introduced. But it is not clear whether enough funds have been
earmarked to satisfy pending wage claims from the 3.6m civil servants, who
have called a strike on October 13.
Taken together these various measures underline the government's desire to
balance austerity with a business friendly budget that builds upon the
strong economic recovery now in evidence. The financial markets have reacted
positively largely because the budget is tougher than anticipated. But the
markets are still cautious because the government has done little more than
the minimum necessary to tackle the deficit. The 1996 budget will have to
find similar sums to hold down spending needs and the deficit will still be
far from complying with Maastricht criteria.
The extra cost of debt service resulting from the half percentage rise in
the discount rate in August is not included in the budget. Other doubts also
exist: on the yield from the two tax amnesties which are measures that have
a notoriously unreliable record; on the ability of an inefficient civil
service, now threatened by reform, to carry out the necessary cuts; on the
natural tendency of Italian governments to understate spending needs; on the
optimistic 2.5 per cent inflation target for 1995.
Such doubts mean the Bank of Italy will not be easily persuaded to lower
interest rates which are four points higher than in Germany. Unfortunately,
the bank's view is also likely to be coloured by the five-month stand-off
with the government over appointing a new director-general to succeed Mr
Lamberto Dini, who became treasury minister.
