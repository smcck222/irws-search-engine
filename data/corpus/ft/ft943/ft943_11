FT  14 SEP 94 / Public sector workers face third year of pay squeeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is preparing to impose for the third
consecutive year a squeeze on the pay of 5m public sector workers.
In evidence to be delivered tomorrow to the independent public-sector pay
review bodies, the Treasury will insist that there can be no automatic
presumption of a pay rise next year for central government and local
authority workers. The move implies another freeze in the government's pay
bill, with any increases in wages for particular groups of workers dependent
on efficiency savings.
Mr Clarke will accept that, as this year when most received an additional
2.7 per cent, workers covered by the review bodies will be eligible for
modest pay awards when justified by productivity.
He will insist that the promise of permanently low inflation means that the
annual public-sector pay round can no longer be seen as an automatic
entitlement.
The pay review bodies, whose recommendations will be published early next
year, cover 1.4m nurses, doctors, teachers, members of the armed forces and
senior government employees.
But the freeze on the pay bill will apply also to the much larger number of
workers in central and local government.
The expectation in Whitehall is that the 3.5m workers outside the review
bodies will face a still tougher squeeze. The Treasury has identified
local-authority spending as a particular target for further cuts.
Mr Clarke's decision follows a warning to his cabinet colleagues that the
windfall savings expected in spending from faster growth and lower inflation
must be used to cut the government's borrowing requirement.
He is concerned to damp expectations that it will be easy to repeat in the
November Budget his success last year in cutting Pounds 10bn from the
government's spending targets.
Several special factors - including unusually small contributions to the
European Union budget and low local-authority borrowing - that helped the
Treasury to cut spending this year will be reversed in 1995.
Mr Clarke is determined that savings on the government's 'cyclical
expenditure' - notably unemployment benefit - is not simply transferred to
fund 'structural' spending by Whitehall departments.
He has told cabinet colleagues that the overall spending figures set out in
his Budget last November represented 'ceilings' rather than targets.
The Treasury set a global Whitehall figure of Pounds 263bn for 1995-96 and
Pounds 272bn for 1996-97, representing increases in real terms of less than
1 per cent each year.

FT  14 SEP 94 / French government to sell 28% of Renault car group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES

<DATELINE>
   PARIS, STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government yesterday announced plans for a partial privatisation
of Renault, the state-owned motor group which is one of the most attractive
assets in the country's public sector and a former bastion of union power.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said that the government would
sell a 28 per cent stake in the company by the end of the year and that the
flotation would be accompanied by a FFr2bn (Pounds 240m) capital increase.
Industry analysts value the group at between FFr42bn and FFr46bn.
The planned flotation follows an agreement with Volvo, the Swedish motor
group, which is to reduce its 20 per cent stake in Renault to 12 per cent
immediately with the option of selling a further 4 per cent at the time of
the share issue. The two companies have been unravelling a complex system of
cross-shareholdings since the collapse of merger plans in December last
year.
Yesterday's announcement follows months of speculation about the sale, which
has been complicated by opposition from trade unions and opposition
political parties. They claim that privatisation will lead to job losses and
that the car company is a national asset which should not be sold. The
Confederation Generale du Travail, the communist-led union, said it will
take action against the planned share issue.
Prime minister Edouard Balladur has sought to defuse union opposition by
insisting that Renault will remain in French hands and that the government's
stake will remain above 50 per cent. The shares would be offered principally
to French investors and Renault employees.
Mr Louis Schweitzer, the Renault chairman, welcomed the move. 'We are an
increasingly competitive company and it seems to me that what has been
decided gives us an additional trump,' he said. The capital increase would
give Renault valuable development funds, he added.
Industry analysts said they expected strong demand for shares in the
automobile company. Renault is one of the most profitable European car
manufacturers and is one of the few international car groups to have
remained in profit through the industry recession of the past few years.
Earlier this month it reported first half net profits of FFr1.7bn, more than
double the figure for the same period in 1993.
'The issue will be attractive to the French public because it is regarded as
a strong company and because it is a familiar brand,' said one analyst at a
Paris securities company.
International investors may, however, be frustrated in attempts to buy
Renault shares. 'It seems that the amount of stock available will be
limited,' one British stockbroker said.
Mr Alphandery said that French industrial and financial groups would take
part in the partial privatisation. Probable candidates include Elf
Aquitaine, the oil group, Banque Nationale de Paris and Groupe Lagardere,
the media to missiles company.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Unions scoff at tax breaks for servants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
French prime minister Mr Edouard Balladur's latest job-creation measures
drew a mixed reaction yesterday. The opposition and unions welcomed the
proposed government subsidy to companies hiring the long-term unemployed,
but scoffed at increased tax incentives to encourage the middle class to
hire more servants.
In his Sunday night television interview, Mr Balladur also proposed, as 'a
collective commitment' for all his countrymen rather than an electoral
promise, that the 3.3m jobless total should be reduced by 1m 'over several
years'.
The Socialist opposition party yesterday criticised the prime minister's
plan to quadruple the amount individuals can deduct from their own tax bill
in social charges and pay for employees. 'This will help maids in posh
areas, but hardly make a big impact on slum unemployment,' said the
Socialist spokesman.
Mr Balladur's other job plan is to give subsidies to companies hiring those
unemployed who have qualified for so-called RMI welfare payments for at
least two years, and who are at the bottom of the heap of French society.
France's Patronat employers' federation said yesterday it was launching its
own inquiry into corporate ethics and relations with the law and politics,
following a series of corruption allegations against the heads of leading
companies.
The Patronat move follows Mr Balladur's announcement that he would appoint a
three-man committee composed of a former Patronat president, a former union
leader and a senior magistrate to report on issues raised by the scandals.
Mr Francois Perigot, the Patronat president, said his inquiry 'would
question everyone concerned by this dysfunctioning of the system'.

FT  13 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Kingfisher unsettled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JEFFREY BROWN, STEVE THOMPSON and RAMRAJ GOGNA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stores group Kingfisher saw an early gain clipped back as worrying stories
of executive changes moved through the market ahead of the company's interim
figures, due today.
The Woolworths and B&amp;Q parent has suffered from what many in the market see
as an unsuccessful sales policy known as 'Every Day Low Pricing', and
concern over the competition in the DIY market from Home Depot, of the US.
Full-year forecasts have edged down and the share price has tumbled from
almost 780p at the peak in December.
There was talk yesterday that Mr James Kerr-Muir, the finance director who
replaced current Asda chairman Archie Norman, could be under pressure. But
there is also thought to be little love lost between chairman Sir Geoffrey
Mulcahy and Mr Alan Smith, the chief executive. Kingfisher had been up 6 but
ended the day only 2 better at 490p.
Banks and insurances were among the market's best performing areas, with the
former given a strong push by the move to higher interest rates in the UK,
which dealers said would help boost margins for the banks.
Barclays was the star turn, racing up 10 more to 595p, helped by recent
broker buy recommendations; turnover was 6.6m shares.
The sharp slide on the Hong Kong market, ahead of the visit by Mr Douglas
Hurd, the UK home secretary, later this week, upset HSBC Holdings, which
fell 11 to 737p and put pressure on Standard Chartered, 4 cheaper at 267p.
Composite insurances attracted solid support and were not badly affected by
reports of an earth tremor in the US. Guardian Royal Exchange moved up 6 to
193p, Royal 7 to 281p and General Accident 10 to 564p.
Prudential was the pick of the life assurances, closing 4 1/2 firmer at 315
1/2 p at the start of an important week which brings interims from
Prudential, Legal &amp; General and United Friendly.
Clothes retailer Country Casuals fell 32 to 120p after warning that
full-year profits would be below expectations.
Meanwhile, Liberty dropped 33 to 355p after announcing losses of Pounds
301,000 in the six months to July, against profits of Pounds 601,000
previously.
There was more news of share buy-backs in the utilities areas of the market.
PowerGen settled 2 easier at 569p after buying a block of 2.5m shares at
573p.
In the regional electricity stocks, Seeboard purchased 1m shares at 434p;
its shares eased 6 to 434p.
Transport shares came under pressure on the back of a reappraisal of debt
worries following the rise in bank base rates.
Eurotunnel tumbled 9 to 270p and British Airways, another heavy borrower,
ended 5 lower at 397p. Ahead of tomorrow's half-year statement, Associated
British Ports fell 13 to 269p, not helped by bearish comment in the weekend
press.
British Aerospace ended a penny off at 496p in the wake of denials of a deal
with Germany's corporate monolith Daimler-Benz. Weekend press comment to the
effect that BAe was discussing the sale of its business interests in Airbus
Industrie was flatly denied by the company, with BAe declaring itself
'absolutely committed to Airbus'.
Fairey, the defence electronics group, jumped 16 to 399p following a surge
in profits.
Circulation figures for August led to cautionary reading for News
International, the Murdoch group which sparked off the newspaper price war.
SG Warburg pointed out to clients that while Sun sales rose 0.2 per cent,
the sales of its chief rivals, the Mirror and Daily record, rose a combined
2.1 per cent. At the other end of the spectrum, sales of Mr Murdoch's Times
were down 0.3 per cent, while the Telegraph had rebounded 1.9 per cent. News
International fell 11 to 239p and Mirror Group was steady at 137p. The
Telegraph slipped 5 to 349p.

FT  13 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: SmithKline firm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JEFFREY BROWN, STEVE THOMPSON and RAMRAJ GOGNA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The market decided that SmithKline Beecham had secured a good price for the
US over-the-counter arm of its recently acquired Sterling Health business.
The shares shrugged off interest rate concern to move up 7 1/2 before
closing 4 ahead at 425 1/2 p.
SmithKline sold the business to Bayer, of Germany, which some analysts
believed had been prepared to pay a premium for the emotional content of the
acquisition. The company, which invented aspirin, lost title in the US after
the First World War as a result of allied reparation demands.
Mr Robin Gilbert of Panmure Gordon had factored in between Dollars 600m and
Dollars 700m for the disposal and was surprised that it had achieved Dollars
1bn. He said the move would go a considerable way to dispersing the gloom
over SmithKline's gearing, which had leapt to a very high level following
the Dollars 2.7bn acquisition of the entire Sterling Health business.

FT  13 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Building sector upset
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JEFFREY BROWN, STEVE THOMPSON and RAMRAJ GOGNA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News of the 1/2 percentage point increase in UK interest rates shocked the
building and property sectors of the market and caused marketmakers to lower
share prices in those groups to head off any selling pressure.
In the event there was no heavyweight selling in either sector. Shares
embarked on a modest rally later in the session, although they closed well
down on the day.
One leading marketmaker in building stocks said the sector had been under
substantial pressure last week when serious talk of possible interest rate
rises first began to circulate. 'Most of the selling was done then; if
anything, the rate rise has cleared the air,' he added.
Building sector analysts took the view that the market had mostly factored
in rate rises. Mr Simon Brown, building analyst at SGST Securities,
commented: 'The impact on the housebuilders will be more psychological than
actual. If anything it could tip prospective buyers over the edge. If they
think interest rates are going up they will want to move quickly to close
their mortgage arrangements.'
Analysts said the rate rise would have little impact on the big building
materials groups, which derive much of their earnings from overseas.
In the housebuilders, Barratt Developments plummeted to 191p before
steadying to close a net 14 off at 214p; the company reports interim figures
next Wednesday. Wilson Connolly dipped 8 to 203p and Wilson Bowden 11 to

FT  13 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities stand up well after base
rate news - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The  1/2 percentage point rise in the Bank of England's key lending rate
failed to upset the UK stock market to any significant degree. Market
strategists applauded Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer,
for his courage in making a pre-emptive strike on base rates, without
waiting for inflationary pressures to reach threatening proportions. The
rate increase was thought unlikely to check significantly the recovery in
the UK economy, or in company profits and dividends.
By the close of trading the FT-SE 100-share Index had recovered more than
half of its initial fall, with the final reading of 3,128.8 showing a net
loss of only 10.5 points - by no means a serious setback. The equity market
took its lead from the UK government bond market, where long-dated issues
closed very firmly. At least one leading securities house raised its
forecasts for both the UK economy and the Footsie index, while at the same
time predicting that interest rates could reach 8 per cent by the end of
next year.
The timing of the Bank's move caught out some traders who had relaxed their
interest rate caution after last week's meeting between the chancellor and
the Governor of the Bank of England had appeared to pass off without drama.
But the disclosure yesterday morning that UK producer output prices had
risen by an unexpected 0.3 per cent in August halted an initial improvement
in share prices and gave the market 20 minutes warning of a possible move on
interest rates.
Shares quickly plunged when the news came, driven by determined selling of
stock index futures by the locals, or independent, futures traders.
Within an hour, the Footsie had transformed a 1.9-point gain to a loss of
25.3. However, the 3,114 mark proved to be the day's low and most of the
gain had been recovered as London waited for Wall Street to reopen after its
uncomfortable session on Friday.
In the event, Wall Street was only 3 Dow points off in UK hours, but sudden
weakness in the US dollar hit the blue chip international stocks in the UK
market and pushed the Footsie down again.
The focus also fell on interest-related stocks. Store and retail issues
performed fairly well, with the leaders showing either very modest losses
or, in some cases, holding steady. There were casualties among the
housebuilding companies, which faced two adverse factors; higher base rates
hit their costs and the danger of a rise in mortgage rates - some building
societies said yesterday they would raise rates - threatens the still
fragile recovery in the housing market.
The second line stocks, having joined in the general shakeout in the market,
were slower than the blue chips to respond to the improvement in bonds. The
FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed 22.7 down at 3,713.3.
But trading volumes were moderate, with the Seaq-reported total of 484.6m
some 25 per cent down from Friday's figure. Retail business on Friday was
worth Pounds 1.28bn.
By the close, the market's attention was switching to prospects for today's
US consumer prices data, which could renew the pressures on the Federal
Reserve caused by the producer price figures announced before the weekend.
There was also uncertainty ahead of the Bundesbank policy meeting on
Thursday, with some analysts suggesting that German rates could still be
reduced.
On the domestic front, the market faces the retail price index for August,
due tomorrow. Although any sting in these figures appears to have been drawn
by the pre-emptive move on base rates, some traders warned that any sharp
rise in RPI could still upset the stock market.

FT  13 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures ran into some heavy selling following the announcement
of higher UK interest rates, but staged a good rally later when trading
volume died down.
At the close the September contract on the FT-SE 100 Index, which expires at
the end of the week, stood at 3,112, a discount of 16 to the underlying cash
market, with the fair value premium adjusted to around 3 points to allow for
the rise in interest rates on carrying costs.
The selling came mostly from the locals, or independent, traders, with one
source hitting the contract hard. In the hectic period following the Bank of
England's announcement, the contract dropped to a low of 3,101, only to
recover strongly and reach a high for the day of 3,140 in mid-afternoon.
Trading volume of just under 18,000 September contracts was high but not by
any means dramatic, and included a significant proportion of roll-over deals
into the December contract. Traders believe that most of these deals have
now been completed, opening the way for a smooth expiry operation on Friday.
Volume in traded options increased to 42,477 contracts, from under 41,000 on
Friday, but the Footsie option saw reduced activity of 12,872 lots. Among
individual stock options, Hanson was the most active with 2,647 dealt.

FT  13 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow slips as takeover news
holds attention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices receded yesterday in a mostly lacklustre session highlighted
by takeover news in the food, insurance and health care sectors, writes
Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 14.47 lower at 3,860.34, while the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 shed 1.97 to 466.21. In the
secondary markets, the American SE composite was up a scant 0.52 at 455.06
but the Nasdaq composite receded 3.72 to 760.01.
For the most part it was a day of waiting on Wall Street. Many investors
were quietly adjusting their positions ahead of the release this morning of
the August consumer price index. As a result, volume was light, with 245m
shares traded on the Big Board by the close.
Before a sharp increase in producer prices was revealed last week, analysts
were forecasting a 0.4 per cent increase in the CPI. If the data came in
higher, as some observers feared yesterday, stocks could tumble along with
bond prices, as they had done on Friday.
In the meantime, an uneasy calm prevailed, although the Dow industrials were
hurt by a Dollars 1 1/4 decline in Caterpillar's share price to Dollars 54
1/4 . The company, which relies heavily on export markets, appeared
vulnerable after reports suggesting that Congress might not ratify the Gatt
world trade agreement this year. International Paper lost Dollars 1 3/8 at
Dollars 73 1/8 .
Elsewhere, blue chips languished in sluggish activity.
In spite of the overall lack of direction, a fresh batch of takeovers and a
wave of speculation on deals in the works inspired brisk trading in some
individual issues.
The day's most significant development was the announcement that Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts would offer RJR Nabisco stock for all of Borden's common
shares, in a deal valued at Dollars 2bn. Borden's share price, which had
been hovering near its 52-week low, climbed Dollars 2 to Dollars 13 5/8 ,
while RJR retreated Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 6 3/4 .
In health care, GenCare Health Systems jumped Dollars 6 1/2 to Dollars 46
after agreeing to be acquired by United Healthcare for Dollars 520m in cash.
United was marked down Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 53.
By contrast, investors were cool to the news that two life insurers were
merging. USLICO retreated Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 20 3/8 and NWNL fell
Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 29 7/8 after announcing a Dollars 237m unification
pact.
Woolworth added Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 17 3/4 on a published report that
raised the possibility of a leveraged buyout of the retailer for Dollars
2.3bn, or Dollars 25 a share.
In pharmaceuticals, takeover speculation continued to swirl around
Warner-Lambert, sending it down Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 81 1/2 . SmithKline
Beecham was marked up Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 30 1/8 after agreeing to sell
the North American over-the-counter drugs business of its Sterling Winthrop
unit to Bayer's Miles Laboratories.
Canada
After a sharp morning fall, share prices in Toronto staged an afternoon
recovery to close little changed. Some analysts believed that the relative
stability of the market suggested that investors had already discounted an
expected victory by the separatist Parti Quebecois in yesterday's Quebec
provincial election.
The TSE 300 index was finally up 0.73 of a point at 4,329.87 as losing
issues outnumbered rises by 418 to 309 after volume of 72.2m shares.

FT  13 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa ends broadly lower
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Johannesburg ended broadly lower as initial losses in golds and other mining
shares spread to the broader market amid a lack of fresh direction and
limited buying support.
The overall index, after edging higher at the start, finished 63 down at
5,892, while golds lost 45 at 2,419 and industrials dipped 22 to 6,595.
Traders said short term equity index futures, which close out on Thursday,
were calling golds slightly better but were discounting a fall in the
industrial and overall indices.
The newly listed Nasionale Pers added R2 at R21 - sharply above expectations
which were as low as R17 - in heavy volume of R115m.
Iscor lost 12 cents at R4.58 as profits continued to be taken after recent
gains.

FT  13 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Equity markets feels sting in tail
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's equity markets were broadly lower over a week which brought a
sting in its tail. On Friday, Wall Street and leading European markets
finished in retreat in reaction to US figures showing an unexpectedly sharp
rise in wholesale prices during August, which raised the spectre of rising
inflation and interest rates. Italy was the week's biggest loser, weighed
down by worries about cabinet splits and vacillation, and doubts about the
government's ability to take decisive action on the 1995 budget. Last week's
focus was on government plans to cut at least L8,000bn from pensions,
prompting trade union threats of a 'hot autumn' of conflict if the proposals
were not rewritten. Today, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, meets
the unions to discuss the issue in what is being seen as the first real test
of his stated resolve to take firm, but fair, measures on the economy.

FT  13 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei gains ground for
the first time in six sessions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Equities rose for the first time in six trading days, but concern about
oversupply weighed on activity, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average was up 19.40 at 19,917.28 after a day's high of
19,973.39 and low of 19,882.58. Institutional investors and public funds
supported share prices, but the upside was limited by small-lot sales and
arbitrage unwinding. Volume was only 194m shares, against Friday's 581m.
Investor confidence remained depressed as Japan Telecom, the long distance
telecommunications operator listed on the second section last week, lost
further ground. Friday's Wall Street decline also weighed on sentiment.
Traders said worries over the listing of Japan Tobacco next week prevailed.
'The sentiment indicators like the ratio of put and call options show that
people are more bearish than the same time last year,' said Mr Alan Livsey
at Kleinwort Benson.
Investors are also wary of Matsushita Electric Industrial's planned Y200bn
convertible bonds issuance early next month.
The Topix index of all first section stocks eased 0.43 to 1,586.17 and the
Nikkei 300 edged up 0.16 to 289.04. Falls led rises by 488 to 464, with 229
issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 0.89 to 1,291.39.
Japan Telecom posted a new low of Y4.27m, falling Y13,000. Other
telecommunication stocks were also lower, with DDI down Y9,000 to Y898,000
and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Y1,000 to Y884,000.
Steels were firm on selling and buying back activity by investors who wanted
to realise profits ahead of the September book closing. Nippon Steel rose Y5
to Y375.
Some banks, which were down last week on profit-taking, rallied. Bank of
Tokyo put on Y20 at Y1,510.
Matsushita Electric Industrial receded Y30 to Y1,620 on fears of oversupply
caused by its expected convertible bond issue. Sumitomo Bakelite dropped Y26
to Y691 due to the weakness of its convertible bonds floated last week.
Daito Trust Construction fell by its daily limit of Y400 to Y1,620 following
reports of sharply lower pre-tax profits projections for the current
business year to next March.
In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 21.80 to 22,228.12 in volume of 42m
shares. Rohm, a semiconductor device maker, rose Y80 to Y4,260 on a higher
pre-tax profits forecast.
Roundup
The region's markets reflected the fall on Wall Street on Friday, and fears
of an interest rate rise.
HONG KONG slid 2.5 per cent, with Chinese-incorporated issues the hardest
hit after a recent rally, followed by the interest rate-sensitive property
sector. The Hang Seng index shed 254.65 to 9,890.37, not far above the day's
low of 9,856.11. Turnover was a provisional HKDollars 5.08bn, down from
Friday's HKDollars 7.28bn.
The H share index of China incorporated companies fell 46.67, or 3.2 per
cent, to 1,431.42. Among H shares, Shanghai Petrochemical declined 8 cents
to HKDollars 2.74, Maanshan Iron and Steel also 8 cents to HKDollars 2.71
and Donfang Electric 42 cents to HKDollars 4.10.
Property companies, highly sensitive to interest rate moves, were heavily
sold: Sun Hung Kai Properties fell HKDollars 1.75 to HKDollars 58 and Cheung
Kong HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 39.20.
Elsewhere, Guoco Group retreated HKDollars 1.30 to HKDollars 37.70, having
made ground recently on speculation that it would be chosen to replace the
Jardine companies in the Hang Seng index following the latter's delisting.
SYDNEY retreated further after Friday's decline. The All Ordinaries index
lost 37.7, or 1.8 per cent, at 2,032.9, while the All Industrials index fell
61.1 to 2,881.9 and All Resources 19.7 to 1,403.4.
News Corp dropped 38 cents to ADollars 8.32 and John Fairfax was down 13
cents at ADollars 2.67.
KUALA LUMPUR fell back on selling of blue chips which knocked 1 per cent off
the market's benchmark index. The composite index shed 12.61 to 1,169.05.
Brokers said the index showed resilience at lower levels and they expected
strong support at the 1,150 level. Volume was 343m shares and losers led
gainers by 301 to 141.
Golden Plus gained 80 cents at MDollars 14.90 on reports that the the
company would announce a major project this week.
MANILA was depressed by losses in the major stocks. The composite index fell
62.14 to 2,919.31, with PLDT sliding 1.3 per cent to 1,545 pesos and San
Miguel 'A' 1.5 per cent to 98 pesos.
TAIPEI slipped under the 7,000 mark in a volatile session. The weighted
index dipped 32.34 to 6,967.48, after reaching an intraday high of 7,042.07.
Turnover was thin at TDollars 57bn.
Recently listed Taiwan Semiconductor climbed by the daily 7 per cent limit
for the seventh straight sesion, adding TDollars 9 at TDollars 142.50 on
volume of 3.8m shares.
Textiles made headway, Carnival Textile climbing TDollars 1.60 to TDollars
28.60 and Reward Wool 90 cents to TDollars 48.70.
SEOUL extended early gains in spite of selling intervention by the stock
market stabilisation fund. The composite stock index rose 9.18 to 995.70.
Advances exceeded declines by 483 to 325, with 175 going limit up. Samsung
Electronics staged a rebound, rising the day's limit of Won3,000 to
Won138,700.
SINGAPORE was broadly lower in thin trade. The Straits Times Industrial
index slipped 19.57 to 2,280.39, with an estimated 170m shares traded.
BOMBAY climbed to a record high on continued speculative buying. The BSE
index closed at a provisional 4,643.31, up 92.36 or 2 per cent. Brokers said
better half-year results helped the rally.
The BSE index has shown a steady upward movement throughout the year and is
now 34 per cent higher than its year's opening of 3,465.86.
Brokers attributed the speculative interest to strong hopes that the
Securities and Exchange Board of India would approve a recent BSE proposal
for the introduction of a 90-day futures contract.
BANGKOK declined on fears of a possible interest rate rise. The SET index
closed 18.44, or 1.2 per cent, lower at 1,490.41. Turnover was Bt7.4bn.
Stocks fell across the board, led by banks which lost 2.2 per cent.
WELLINGTON followed the region's trend, losing 2.2 per cent. The NZSE-40
capital index fell 47.63 to 2,111.09 in light NZDollars 40.4m turnover.

FT  13 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Rise in UK base rates
unsettles the Continent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a day of contrasts among the Continent's markets yesterday.
FRANKFURT fell back sharply during an active session. The Dax index sank
30.54 to 2,154.61, moving within a range of 2,140.66 and 2,154.66 during the
day. In the post-bourse the Ibis-indicated index gained slightly to
2,155.99.
Of the 30 DAX stocks, declining issues outnumbered advances by 26 to 4.
Turnover amounted to DM5bn.
Lufthansa was actively traded on news, within market expectations, that it
was to offer 7.64m new ordinary shares to existing shareholders at a price
of DM160. Shareholders would be able to buy one new share for every four
held. The airline's shares improved DM3 to DM200. The government is not
taking part in the rights issue, so reducing its stake from 51.4 per cent to
about 41 per cent. The 3.9m shares which the government will take up will be
sold to investors at home and abroad, excluding the US, via a syndicate of
international banks led by Dresdner Bank.
Bayer dropped DM6.50 to DM368.50 on news that it had paid Dollars 1bn for
the right to acquire the North American over-the-counter pharmaceuticals
activities of Sterling-Winthrop from SmithKline Beecham. The acquisition
includes the right to use the Bayer name in North America, lost some 75
years ago.
PARIS overcame a weak opening, following the rise in UK interest rates, on
an improvement in the bond market. The CAC-40 index added 17.96 at 1,966.79.
Turnover was light at FFr2.5bn.
There was further negative news for Saint-Gobain with reports that an
executive of a subsidiary was to be questioned by magistrates. However, the
shares made ground on expectations of good first-half results being reported
on Thursday, firming FFr4 to FFr640.
MILAN was lower, awaiting today's meeting between Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the
prime minister, and the trades unions over pension reform, and depressed by
the UK's move on interest rates. The Comit index weakened 13.70, or 2.1 per
cent, to 648.83.
Goldman Sachs, which is keeping its rolling 12-month Comit index target
unchanged at 800, said it continued to expect the strong earnings momentum
and slightly more attractive valuation to support a 17 to 20 per cent total
annual return for equities, even though the short term prospects were
suffering from a high level of uncertainty over the government's fiscal
policy.
Olivetti, L52 or 2.6 per cent lower at L1,954, continued to be pressured by
worries that first-half results might disappoint the market, and the
investigation into the awards of state contracts.
Cir, the industrial holding company, gave up a further L47, or 2.4 per cent,
to L1,936.
Against the trend, Ciga, the luxury hotels group, rose L12 to L1,088. At the
weekend, ITT-Sheraton fixed its public buy offer for 367m shares at L1,102 a
share. The offer begins next Monday and if successful would leave Sheraton
with 70 per cent of Ciga.
ZURICH was closed for a local holiday, but prices overcame early weakness in
active Basle trading after Wall Street's firm opening. The SMI index, down
17.6 early in the day, finished 0.9 higher at 2,643.0.
Banks led the uptrend, with CS Holding putting on SFr7 at SFr563 after the
group said it was withdrawing its offer for Austria's
Creditanstalt-Bankverein. UBS bearers were SFr4 higher at SFr1,209. Insurers
and industrial shares mostly closed with marginal losses. Registered shares
in Sandoz fell SFr5 to SFr670.
AMSTERDAM was broadly lower, although some gains were seen during the
session, particularly from Heineken, up Fl 3.60 at Fl 248.10, following the
strong performance on Friday.
The AEX index finished 1.38 down at 411.81.
MADRID, returning from a long holiday weekend, dipped 2.1 per cent as it
caught up with Friday's losses in other European markets. The general index
fell 6.46 to 298.72 in slim volume of below Pta20bn as the market awaited
today's Spanish and US inflation data.
Among heavily hit banks, Santander and Argentaria each fell Pta100 to
Pta5,120 and Pta5,210 respectively.
DUBLIN drifted lower in thin volume and the ISEQ overall index closed 10.76
easier at 1,909.34. One analyst commented that the Irish central bank had no
need to follow the interest rate lead from London on economic grounds, and
would, indeed, be anxious to demonstrate its autonomy.
STOCKHOLM advanced strongly, with heavy demand seen for Astra. The
Affarsvarlden general index gained 9.4 at 1,450.3. Good demand for Swedish
bonds and a firmer krona led to a decline in interest rates and provided
support for the bourse.
Astra saw turnover of SKr800m, or some 28 per cent of the day's total of
SKr2.9bn, and the 'A' shares rose SKr3 to SKr186 while the 'B' finished SKr4
up at SKr185.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Markets Report: UK rate rise lifts sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling made good gains yesterday after the Bank of England's unexpected
decision to lift the minimum lending rate by 50 basis points to 5.75 per
cent, writes Philip Gawith.
The pound rose some two pfennigs, and more than a cent, on the news before
levelling out to close in London at DM2.4117 and Dollars 1.5626, from
DM2.3914 and Dollars 1.5509 on Friday. The trade weighted index finished at
79.1 from 78.6.
Analysts, however, stopped short of saying that sterling had managed to
detach itself from the downtow of the dollar. The rate move appears to have
put a floor under the currency, rather than to have necessarily given it any
significant upside momentum.
Sterling futures lost a lot of ground, the September contract trading 38,000
lots to close 40 points lower, at 94.07 from 94.47. The December contract
saw nearly 88,000 lots dealt and ended at 93.30, down 37 basis points from
Friday's close.
The rise in UK rates overshadowed activities in Europe, where most
currencies had a generally quieter day.
The dollar was slightly firmer against the D-Mark but weaker in terms of the
yen, ahead of today's release of the August US consumer price index. The
release will be closely watched following the dollar's two-pfennig drop last
Friday, on news that the August PPI rose 0.6 per cent.
The US currency finished in London at DM1.5435 from DM1.5419 and at Y98.985
from Y99.265. It ended in New York at DM1.5433 and Y99.15.
The decision to raise rates was widely, though not universally, welcomed.
Most saw it as a timely pre-emptive strike against inflation.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, boosted his credibility through his
apparent willingness to place the economy above party politics.
The Bank of England's reputation was also enhanced, in the eyes of some. Mr
Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist in London at Bank of America, said: 'The
clear message is that the Bank of England has much more independence in
setting monetary policy than it has had in its history.' He added that this
had to be a plus factor for sterling, in the long term.
Although the decision to lift rates caught most offside, it did not come
entirely out of the blue. Mr Philip Shaw, economist at Union Discount, noted
that three-month sterling LIBOR had been above base rates since July. The
Bank had made no effort to protest, which suggested it was happy to leave
markets with the impression that rates would rise.
The handling, and timing, of the move was criticised by some money market
practitioners. Some felt that the Bank had misled the market by, in its
daily operations last Thursday, offering a repurchase agreement which gave
assistance at the established (lower) rate. Many took this as a clear signal
that rates were on hold.
But others supported the Bank on this count. Mr Nick Parsons, treasury
economist at CIBC, said: 'There have been several occasions in the past when
we have had a rate move with a repo outstanding.'
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, also warned: 'My
experience in the money markets has been: never say never.'
Both, however, were critical of the handling of the move. 'The Bank has used
its discretion over the precise timing of a rate change in a way which
unsettles investors, destabilises traders and maximises uncertainty about
future changes,' added Mr Parsons.
Mr MacKinnon said it was easier to read the intentions of the Fed and
Bundesbank. 'With the Bank of England we still live in Smiley's world of
secrecy.' He said the fact that some highly respected economists had been
wrong-footed 'shows how the Bank has made confusing and misleading signals
to the market'.
Some money market operators were also critical that the Bank could have set
a 5.19688 per cent interest rate, on a Pounds 4.5bn floating rate gilt
issue, last Friday. Official sources pointed out, however, that the
quarterly date for changing the interest rate was inflexible, and set months
in advance.
The D-Mark finished weaker against most currencies. Analysts said markets
were beginning to worry whether Chancellor Kohl's governing coalition would
win an outright majority in the national elections in October. The German
unit closed at SKr4.853, from SKr4.902. Against the French franc it stood at
FFr3.425 from FFr3.427.
The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 180m late
assistance. Earlier it had supplied Pounds 624m liquidity at the new rate of
5 5/8 per cent, up from 5 1/8 per cent. Overnight money traded between 4 3/4
and 7 per cent.
Cash market rates moved up in line with the higher base rate. Three-month
LIBOR ended at 5 7/8 per cent from Friday's 5 7/16 . One-year LIBOR closed
at 7 1/8 per cent from 6 13/16 .
Analysts said the sharp move in short sterling was an over-reaction,
reflecting the extent to which the market had assumed rates would not be
moving. One source argued that if the Bank had moved on Thursday, losses
would have been much reduced.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: France seeks lower rate of land
set-aside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France believes that, if the European Union does not substantially reduce
the share of arable land set aside from production next year, the EU may
have to decrease exports or increase imports, officials in Paris said
yesterday.
Last week the French government sent the European Commission a long-promised
memorandum containing the reforms on which Paris would like to see progress
during the French presidency of the EU in the first half of 1995.
In particular, France said it wanted to see the current 15 per cent average
rate of 'set-aside' in the EU reduced 'substantially'. Otherwise, the French
calculate, EU cereal stocks could fall to close to zero next year after the
fall from 20m to 10m tonnes this year. 'Such a level would not be
manageable,' said an agriculture ministry official.
By French calculations, this year's harvest of 158m-162m tonnes, plus 5m
tonnes of imports, would amount to some 10m tonnes less than the total of
anticipated consumption of 140m-145m tonnes plus around 32m tonnes of
exports. If stocks dropped to near zero 'either we would not be able to
export as much as permitted by the Gatt or we would have to increase
imports', said the official.
Another French aim is to improve the competitiveness of EU agriculture to
avoid Gatt-required cuts in subsidised exports.
The limits to subsidising exports were illustrated in the past few days when
France failed to firm up a preliminary contract to sell China up to 1m
tonnes of wheat because a Brussels offer of a subsidy of Ecus 5 a tonne
proved insufficient to bring the price low enough.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Crop fears
lift potato prices - Market jitters mean good news for beleaguered British
growers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is nothing like the suspicion of a shortage to stir up the markets -
and the effect this has had on potato prices has put smiles back on the
faces of Britain's 15,000 growers.
Paradoxically, prices are rising mainly because the crops growers are
harvesting are producing below budgeted yields. Twelve months ago, when last
year's potatoes were being lifted, prices paid to farmers were around Pounds
60 per tonne. Excess supply kept the average ex-farm price around the same
level until June this year.
It was a barely break-even return for even the most efficient growers and
resulted in substantial losses. This year has been different - and looks
like continuing that way. There are three main reasons for this.
First, last year's losses led to a slight under-planting against quotas in
spring 1994 by growers who were feeling insecure. Not only had they made
inadequate returns on their 1993 potatoes, they had also been forced to lift
them during the wettest autumn for years.
Second, they were aware that the future of the Potato Marketing Board, on
which they had relied since the 1930s to support the market, was under
threat from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.
Third, the spring was wet, cold and late. This meant that most potatoes were
planted several weeks later than optimum, and soil temperatures were too low
to promote normal growth.
Early growth and maximum leaf cover before the heat of the summer are
crucial to high yields, and in many cases this year that cover was not
achieved in time - a problem made much worse by the July heatwave. This
combination was potentially lethal for the potato crop, and 20 years ago
would have led to a truly disastrous shortage.
Fortunately about 60 per cent of UK potato growers are now able to irrigate
their crops, saving a great many potatoes from being virtually burned in the
soil. As a result domestic supplies, although reduced, should be adequate -
with a little luck.
That luck will be needed during the next few weeks as the so-called maincrop
potato harvest gets under way. Provided there is not too much rain, the
remaining acreage should be gathered safely, guaranteeing supplies until
next spring. It is the possibility that the weather could turn wet again -
and that this could cause losses when supplies are tight - that is
presumably behind the feverish futures market and the high spot prices.
Most farmers are being paid at least Pounds 100 per tonne - and in some
cases Pounds 150 per tonne - more for potatoes this year than last. The
futures price for next May went up last week to Pounds 240 per tonne.
Given that this year's anticipated tonnage is 5.5m-5.6m tonnes, compared
with about 6.2m tonnes last year, it may appear difficult to understand why
prices should be so much higher.
One reason may be that there is a shortage of alternative supplies in
Europe. In Amsterdam and Lille, for instance, potato futures markets are
said to be even more excited than London's.
The same weather that reduced UK potato yields has affected crops in Holland
and France, and those countries which can usually be relied on as sources of
cheap surpluses are unlikely to be able to oblige this year.
There will be plenty of happy faces at this week's potato harvesting
demonstration near York, for there are few farm crops which respond to the
suspicion of a shortage more dramatically than potatoes.
This buoyancy has led to headlines in the tabloid press saying that retail
potato prices will double or more during the coming winter. The sources of
these stories can only be guessed at, but are they justified?
Consider these figures: the current ex-farm price for top quality King
Edward potatoes is Pounds 200 per tonne, or 20p per kg. The wholesale price
for the same grade and the same variety is 24p per kg.
But last weekend the retail price for King Edwards, packed in plastic bags
of 2.5kg at my local supermarket, was 66p per kg - or Pounds 660 per tonne.
I am well aware that packing, transporting and displaying potatoes on
shelves costs money. But I would have thought there was a sufficient margin
between the wholesale price and retail price for a fair proportion of the
kind of ex-farm increases I have described to be absorbed without
significantly affecting profitability.
Retailers often say that consumers prefer price stability. No doubt that is
why they hold prices higher than they need to be when wholesale levels fall.
Many farmers believe that policy has governed the retail price of potatoes
over a number of years. The coming winter will be an ideal opportunity for
those retailers to demonstrate that they really do believe in price
stability - even when the market goes modestly against them.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Lack of attention to
customers' says Tesco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK potato industry pays too little attention to its customers, Tesco,
the supermarket group, said yesterday.
Mr Andrew Batty, Tesco's fresh produce trading manager, told the World
Potato Congress in Harrogate, Yorkshire, that consumers wanted quality,
value and reassurance that the food they bought was health-giving and
produced with the minimum of chemicals. They were also spoilt for choice.
Yet he said: 'One of the things that continues to amaze me about our
industry is how much emphasis we put on the growing side of the business and
how little we put into understanding what the customer wants.'
Mr Batty told the Congress, attended by delegates from about 50 countries,
that the supply chain had to become more efficient if growers, processors
and supermarkets were to make enough money to survive and re-invest.
Tesco has just commissioned research from Adas, the government's farm
advisory service, into the feasibility of supply contracts between the group
and growers.
Mr Batty acknowledged that growers faced an uncertain future with the
abolition of the statutory Potato Marketing Board in 1997.
'In periods of uncertainty it's always best to concentrate on what one does
best. It is up to us to get on with the business of selling potatoes, as a
team clearly focused on providing what the customer wants.'

FT  13 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium market bullish
despite increase in stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A bigger-than-expected rise in producer stocks reported yesterday took the
aluminium market by surprise. But, once the initial impact was absorbed, the
news made scarcely a dent on the market's bullish sentiment and the
aluminium price seemed determined to keep heading towards USDollars 1,600 a
tonne.
Many analysts had been predicting that the International Primary Aluminium
Institute (IPAI) would report producer stocks virtually unchanged.
However, the organisation said total stocks, which had fallen every month
since February, rose by 80,000 tonnes in July to 3.614m tonnes.
Some traders pointed out that July marked the start of shut-downs for the
northern hemisphere summer holidays in many aluminium consuming industries.
Also, a fall in London Metal Exchange warehouse stocks in July - by a record
104,000 tonnes - more than compensated for the rise in producer stocks.
They suggested that aluminium would go on to test Dollars 1,600 a tonne,
which analysts say is the next important technical resistance point.
There were words of caution from some observers, however. Mr Angus
MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, said the aluminium
price was getting ahead of itself.
'There are still huge stocks overhanding the market - about 14 weeks of
consumption - and eventually the market will realise this and settle down to
sideways trading. Things are often overdone in the early stages of a
recovery and the first-quarter rise in (aluminium) prices is not sustainable
to the year-end.'
The output cuts made by aluminium producers so far this year were 'having an
impact beyond their wildest dreams'. As long as the producers stuck to their
guns, there would be a supply deficit of about 400,000 tonnes this year and
one of 1m tonnes in 1995, he said.
Consequently, Mr MacMillan is forecasting aluminium prices averaging 65
cents a lb this year (Dollars 1,433 a tonne) and 75 cents (Dollars 1,653) in
1995. Aluminium for delivery in three months on the LME closed last night up
Dollars 5.25 a tonne at Dollars 1,592.

Market report

<TEXT>
Technical and speculative buying saw nickel's price rise strongly on the
London Metal Exchange, and by the close traders were suggesting that the
metal was 'seriously overbought'.
Successive waves of buy-stops were triggered when the price moved through
Dollars 6,500 and Dollars 6,600 a tonne, putting prices on course for a
run-up to the year's highs above Dollars 6,900 again, traders said. Nickel
ended at Dollars 6,635 a tonne, up Dollars 215 from Friday's kerb (after
hours) trading.
Coffee futures ended a thin session firmer as the market kept a nervous eye
on the weather in Brazil. The November position was up Dollars 29 at Dollars
3,984 after peaking at Dollars 4,010 in the morning. Weather Services
Corporation said dry weather would lead to more losses.

The good general demand continued, reports the Tea Brokers' Association.
Quality and good medium Assams sold well at around last levels, but medium
types were easier. Brightest east Africans were fully firm, with mediums and
coloury central Africans often dearer. Low mediums remained steady. Ceylons
sold readily at dearer levels, with the brighter lines 5-8p dearer. Good
demand at firm rates. The few Assams on offer were unsold. Quotations: best

FT  13 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Record soyabean harvest
expected

<TEXT>
The US Department of Agriculture boosted its estimate of this year's
soyabean harvest yesterday, saying it would be the largest ever.
The revised forecast of 2.316bn bushels was up from an August estimate of
2.282bn. The previous record was 2.261bn bushels in 1979.
The USDA also raised its prediction for the US maize crop to 9.257bn
bushels. It had previously forecast 9.214bn bushels.
Mr William Biedermann, an market analyst for the advisory firm Allendale,
Inc., said that projections for US maize production were likely to rise as
the harvest continued. 'Big crops get bigger,' he said.
Although the forecast for record production weighed on soyabean futures
prices at the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday, maize prices were higher at
mid-session. 'The USDA expanded its figures for domestic and export use for
corn, so carry-over stocks don't rise,' said Mr Jerry Gidel, grain analyst
with Dean Witter Reynolds in Chicago.
Wheat prices also rallied as the USDA dropped its world carry-over figure to
119.4m tonnes, supporting traders' belief that the Australian wheat crop
would continue to deteriorate. As wheat prices rise, it becomes less
competitive with corn for animal feed.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Survey of Sao Paulo (7): Cost of growth on the environment -
Social conditions may be about to improve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sao Paulo city is an ill-fitting muddle of the developed and developing
world. While all but the poorest houses have electricity and running water,
less than half the city's domestic sewage is treated. Infant mortality and
illiteracy are among the lowest in Brazil, but levels of violence and air
pollution are among the highest. While the city's population growth has
slowed considerably, at least 1m people still live in shanty towns, known as
favelas, which dot the city's outskirts.
This dichotomy has its roots in Sao Paulo's rapid growth over the past 50
years. Until the second world war, the city was a provincial centre grown
rich on coffee profits. As industrialisation gathered pace, it attracted
immigrants from poorer parts of Brazil, especially the north-east. Between
1940 and 1970 the city grew at about 5 per cent a year, from a population of
1.3m to 5.9m.
Growth started to slow only in the 1980s, but not before the population had
nearly doubled, reaching 9.5m in 1991. Industrial suburbs that were once
separated from the city by green belts have merged into a single urban
sprawl. If these suburbs are included, the population of the greater Sao
Paulo metropolitan area is over 15m, making it the largest urban centre in
South America.
Sao Paulo's attraction has always been its economy. Until the beginning of
the 1980s, industrial employment grew steadily and offered even semi-skilled
immigrants the chance of relative prosperity. As Brazil's economic crisis
struck in the 1980s, Sao Paulo's informal economy - ranging from armies of
street sellers to gambling networks - provided a cushion against rising
unemployment.
Families have continued to arrive in the city over the past 10 years,
although in much smaller numbers. Many still regard a poorly-paid job with a
one-room apartment in Sao Paulo as preferable to staying in Brazil's rural
areas. In the city, they have access to better services and opportunities
for their children.
Sao Paulo's rapid growth extracted a very high price from the city's
environment. Urban growth was so rapid it overlooked the desirability of
keeping 'buffer' areas undeveloped to improve leisure options and air
quality. Extreme reliance on automobiles means air quality is usually poor.
The city's main river, the Tiete, has become overburdened. Every day, it has
to digest more than 1,000 tonnes of organic waste and about three tonnes of
untreated inorganic waste, including chemicals and heavy metals; however, a
state government clean-up is under way.
There has also been a heavy social cost. The need to accelerate government
spending on infrastructure and education has left other sectors underfunded.
In the southern municipality of Diadema, which grew rapidly from the 1960s
because it is close to Sao Paulo's car manufacturers, health centres are
only now being installed.
The public transport system has also failed to keep pace. Despite the city's
size, its underground railway system is still restricted to three lines. In
satellite cities around Sao Paulo, workers have to rely on buses and poor
traffic conditions. Father Antonio Carlos Frizzo, of Guarulhos, near Sao
Paulo's international airport, says that his parishioners spend three hours
a day on buses getting to and from the city.
The heavy strains imposed by such conditions are one reason for the growth
of radical protestant churches. Social strains have also led to growing
violence. In some poorer suburban regions, the murder rate is 90 per 10,000
inhabitants. However, there are areas of low violence, mainly in the centre.
The city's overall murder rate is only slightly higher than New York's.
Col Hermes Bittencourt Cruz, of the Sao Paulo police, links violence and
other crime to the continuing process of urbanisation, poor education and
one of the world's highest income disparities. 'Violence is a perverse
result of disorganised development,' he says.
Mr Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, of the centre for the study of violence at the
University of Sao Paulo, complains of a lack of resources and skills in the
judicial and police systems. In Sao Paulo there is one judge per 20,000
people, compared to one per 5,000 in Europe.
Despite these challenges, Sao Paulo's rapid fall in population growth will
allow better planning of infrastructure and services in the years ahead.
Along with the rest of Brazil, Sao Paulo is also developing some
institutions that are common to industrialised economies - from health and
education networks in the shanty towns to environmental pressure groups. 'We
have grave institutional problems, but our civil society has changed
tremendously in the last 30 years,' Mr Pinheiro says.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Survey of Sao Paulo (6): Instability holds back the markets
 -Patrick McCurry on the progress of Latin America's financial capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While decades of high inflation have turned Brazilians into some of the
world's most creative financial managers, this instability has also held
back the development of the capital markets and its principal financial
centre, Sao Paulo.
But things are changing. A more open economy, increasing foreign portfolio
investment and the prospect of an end to high inflation could turn Sao Paulo
into Latin America's chief financial capital.
During the last decade Sao Paulo has consolidated its position as the heart
of Brazil's financial system. Its stock market has a capitalisation of over
Dollars 130bn, making it the biggest in South America. It has the developing
world's largest futures market and is home to most of the national and
international banks based in Brazil.
Already this year many foreign investment banks and funds have opened
offices in Sao Paulo, betting on an explosion in business as Brazil's big
companies, most of which are based in the state, seek to finance expansion.
'Except for a handful of Brazilian banks still in Rio de Janeiro, all the
big players have moved to Sao Paulo,' says Mr Jose Monforte, Citibank's
director of capital markets in Brazil.
This move began in the 1970s when Rio de Janeiro began to lose its position
as the dominant financial centre. Sao Paulo's industrial strength, combined
with aggressive targeting of new companies coming to market by the Sao Paulo
stock exchange (Bovespa) were the main reasons for the change. Today, the
Bovespa represents 90 per cent of the trading volume of Brazil's nine
exchanges.
It is hoping that, with stabilisation, it will recover its position as Latin
America's biggest stock market from Mexico City.
However, the Bovespa is a highly volatile market, lacking liquidity. Trading
is concentrated in only a few shares and one company, the
government-controlled telecom giant Telebras, accounts for about half the
trading volume.
Mr Alvaro Augusto Vidigal, Bovespa chairman, admits: 'We have an
underdeveloped market.' Largely due to Brazil's economic problems, such as
inflation of 2,500 per cent last year, there has been a fall in the number
of listed companies and few capital issues in recent years.
But a more stable economy combined with rising share values should increase
the attraction of the stock market for firms seeking investment capital, Mr
Vidigal believes.
The concentration of trading in a handful of shares has been partly
responsible for the volatility, according to Mr Julius Buchenrode, director
of investments at Chase Manhattan in Sao Paulo. Investors have generally
done well in the 1990s. The main Bovespa index more than doubled last year
after falling slightly in 1992. The bullish trend looks likely to continue
if the markets' preferred candidate, Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, wins
presidential elections this year.
Much of the index appreciation has been due to the opening of the market to
foreign institutional investors in 1991. They now account for about 20 per
cent of average daily trading volume, which has soared from Dollars 34m in
1991 to Dollars 278m in the first half of this year and approached Dollars
500m in August. According to Mr Vidigal, volume could reach Dollars 700m to
Dollars 800m if economic reforms continue.
While equities have grown in importance due to foreign investment, Sao
Paulo's local bond market has mostly stagnated. Brazil's problems have made
raising capital through local debt issues extremely expensive for companies,
which must pay interest rates of 25-30 per cent in real terms. Analysts say
this market is likely to remain undeveloped in the short term as companies
seek finance through equity issues.
Stabilisation reforms could also boost Sao Paulo's futures and commodities
exchange, which has grown to become the fifth largest in the world with a
daily average of 350,000 contracts, although this growth is partly due to
Brazil's economic instability.
'The market's growth is obviously related to companies trying to protect
themselves against Brazil's inflation,' says Mr Marcos Eugenio da Silva, a
University of Sao Paulo economist, referring to the fact that 60 per cent of
the exchange's volume is in one-day interest rate futures. But a more stable
economy with sustained growth would increase the exchange's business and
lead to a lengthening of contract terms, he says.
Mr Manoel Pires da Costa, the exchange chairman, says future development
will depend on the ending of government restrictions on foreign exchange
transactions, which make it difficult to increase links with foreign futures
exchanges.
As Brazil is one of the world's biggest exporters of coffee, soya and orange
juice, Mr da Costa believes there is potential for attracting some of the
trading in agricultural futures from exchanges in Chicago.
But, according to Mr da Silva, such integration is 'wishful thinking' as it
presupposes a stable and convertible currency, something Brazil still lacks.
A traditionally weak currency has, however, allowed Brazil's commercial
banks to make large profits. With inflation eroding the daily value of
Brazil's currency, banks have been able to invest their clients' money that
is held in current accounts, or the values of cheques being cleared, in the
high-yielding money markets.
Sao Paulo dominates the country's banking system. Twelve of the top 15
private sector banks, measured in terms of deposits, have their head offices
there and the city's banks hold about half of all deposits in Brazil. The
future for the banking system in a low-inflation environment is uncertain,
especially for the less efficient state-owned banks. However, private sector
banks will be able to expand on the back of increased banking charges and
long-term consumer credit. Some larger state banks, including Sao Paulo's
Banespa, will be able to rely on their asset bases and wide branch network.
For foreign investment banks Sao Paulo has become a magnet. After the 1980s
debt crisis, Brazilian companies have gradually returned to the
international debt and equities markets and the country finally sealed its
Brady plan debt deal earlier this year. Commissions and fees from companies
issuing securities abroad, local issues and mergers and acquisitions could
soon total Dollars 1bn a year, say market analysts.
Longer term, optimists believe that Sao Paulo's role as Brazil's financial
powerhouse will be extended with the growth of regional integration,
particularly the Mercosul common market due to come into force at the
beginning of next year.
'We are likely to see close links between Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires,
including dual listings and the creation of a regional financial market,'
says Mr Monforte of Citibank.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Survey of Sao Paulo (3): Costs are cut as jobs are lost -
Angus Foster looks at how industry has coped with economic crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
According to the doomsters, Sao Paulo's industry is on a knife edge. After
years of suffering from Brazil's economic crisis, companies have
underinvested in technology and skills. They must catch up now, while the
country's economy looks to be strengthening, or face rapid extinction from
foreign competition.
The situation is probably slightly more rosy, and certainly less simple,
than the pessimists' predictions. Industry unquestionably has been damaged
by the years of recession and economic 'shock' plans. Manufacturing industry
averaged a 1.3 per cent annual decline in output in the seven years to 1992
and investment rates have fallen 10 percentage points to 15 per cent since
the start of the last decade.
But some sectors, including food processing, auto parts and wood products,
have responded well. Industry as a whole has been forced to reduce its
traditional reliance on government and look abroad for new export markets.
Levels of productivity have risen sharply, although they will have to
improve much further to match developed countries with which Brazil will
increasingly have to compete.
Mr Antonio Correa do Prado, economist at Sao Paulo's Dieese Institute, says
the state's industry bears the scars of the last few years. Employment in
industry is below 1986 levels. Companies laid off 500,000 workers during the
1990-1992 recession alone.
'Sao Paulo's industry has performed in a typically defensive way in order to
survive rather than expand,' he says.
Investment and new technology have been limited, and have mainly been used
to improve management and planning processes. The use of computer technology
in production, for example in design, has so far been limited probably
because of cost, according to Mr Prado.
Rather than invest, companies have spent the last few years trying to cut
costs. The partial opening of Brazil's economy to imports in 1990, and the
realisation of increased future competition, has forced many companies to
restructure radically.
The most visible result has been the drop in industrial employment. But most
companies have improved efficiency in other areas too. It is a common
refrain among businessmen that they are this year likely to produce more
than in 1990 with only half the workforce.
Duratex, a maker of hardboard and bathroom fixtures with eight factories in
Sao Paulo, has reduced its headcount from 14,500 to 7,300 since 1990. It has
also moved its head office into two buildings instead of seven and cut the
delay on delivering orders to the US from 65 to 10 days. 'We realised we had
to be competitive otherwise we would not survive,' says Mr Plinio Pinheiro,
executive director.
The rapid decline in industrial employment in Sao Paulo was seen as
inevitable by companies' managements. But it has been fiercely criticised by
union leaders. They say laid-off workers are being forced into service
sector jobs which are often part-time and lower paid.
Mr Vincente Paulo da Silva, president of Brazil's main trade union grouping
CUT, says that unions agree Brazil has to integrate with the world economy
and develop high technology industries. 'But this can only happen if workers
participate. It cannot happen by throwing workers out onto the street,' he
says.
There have been some important agreements to retain labour in return for
lower wage claims, such as the 1992 pact in the car industry. But industrial
employment is likely to continue to fall in coming years, although at a
reduced rate. New investment will be directed at technology, suggesting the
state's economy will face a growing unemployment problem.
There is greater consensus between management and labour on the speed of
further opening to the world economy. Average tariffs have fallen from 30 to
14 per cent since 1990. Both sides believe further cuts should be cautious
and that industry needs more time to prepare for foreign competition.
Recent hints from the federal Ministry of Finance that import tariffs would
be lowered in a bid to stimulate competition and lower domestic prices, have
been broadly criticised.
Mr Carlos Eduardo Moreira Ferreira, president of the Federation of Sao Paulo
Industries, believes the threats are bluff. 'You cannot just junk our
industries, we cannot accept a total opening yet. No minister of finance can
unilaterally open our markets by abolishing tariffs. For a start, our
industrialists are very strong politically,' he says.
The financial problems of the federal and state governments have accelerated
the state's withdrawal from economic decisions, a process which is set to
continue. Government remains an important client for many industrial
sectors, but the time of cosy relationships is over. 'We are no longer
waiting for the government, we have learned to survive without them,' says
Mr Moreira Ferreira.
One area where businessmen do want government action is the port of Santos
in the south of Sao Paulo state. This is Brazil's most important, but has
become expensive because of inefficient union practices. Mr Pinheiro says
Duratex finds it cheaper to send its export products 1,000km by road to the
state of Parana rather than use Santos. Unfortunately for the businessmen,
Mr Mario Covas, Sao Paulo's probable next governor, has strong backing among
the Santos port workers, and may not be ready to listen to the complaints.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Survey of Sao Paulo (5): All the delights of the big city
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sometimes dubbed 'South America's New York' because of its dynamism,
skyscrapers and mix of cultures, Sao Paulo is a monster of a city. While its
sheer size and confusing layout often overwhelm, an energetic and friendly
population combine with a lively nightlife to compensate, writes Patrick
McCurry.
There are nearly 10m people in the city and about 15m in the metropolitan
region, making it one of the biggest cities in the world. It is also one of
the most cosmopolitan, thanks to the influx of millions of immigrants
earlier this century.
There are descendants of Italians, Portuguese, East Europeans, Arabs and
Jews and the largest Japanese population outside Japan. Recent decades have
seen a big inflow of Brazilians in search of work, either from the state's
interior or often from the poor north-east. Many of these ended up swelling
the favela shanty towns dotted around the city.
Orientation is a problem, both for newcomers and Paulistanos, as the city's
inhabitants are known. Because of its rapid and unplanned growth, the lack
of natural landmarks and a confusing road system, even locals get lost.
Fortunately for foreigners there are plenty of taxis at all times of day. In
addition, work and social life is often concentrated in relatively few
areas. These include Avenida Paulista, which is the main financial centre,
Jardins and Itaim Bibi. These are the districts where imported luxury cars
are almost as common as locally made Fiat Unos and VW Golfs and where the
flats are protected by 24-hour security guards.
Some visitors find these areas a bit characterless but they are a symbol of
Paulistanos' American-style obsession with modernity. Because the city grew
so quickly during the state's post-war industrialisation old buildings,
including the mansions of coffee barons, were torn down to make way for
office and apartment blocks. Today, blocks of flats built in the 1950s are
considered historic.
The city's old centre, known as 'centro', gradually lost importance in the
1960s and 1970s as businesses moved out to areas like Paulista and later to
suburbs like Santo Amaro in the south. Today the centre retains its
character and liveliness but is avoided by many middle-class residents
because of parking problems and worries about crime.
Many Paulistanos like to contrast Sao Paulo with its rival Rio de Janeiro.
Unlike Rio, they say, Sao Paulo is a 'serious' city where hard work is
rewarded. Cariocas, as Rio residents are known, dismiss Paulistanos as
uptight workaholics too busy to enjoy the simple pleasures of life.
Nevertheless, foreign visitors frequently find that Paulistanos, like most
Brazilians, are genuinely friendly and helpful.
In many ways Sao Paulo is trying to be an American city, or at least that
seems to be the aspiration of many middle- class Paulistanos. A frequently
unsatisfactory public transport system, worries about crime and the city's
size have created a strong car culture.
For example, instead of taking a taxi or public transport many wealthy (and
not-so-wealthy) Paulistanos would rather drive to the busy Rua Franz
Schubert, a chic back street housing some of the most ritzy night spots, and
queue for 45 minutes to park. When they leave, they will wait another 45
minutes while the parking valet finds and recovers their car.
Likewise, a popular evening out for middle-class families and adolescents is
to drive to one of the city's shopping malls to eat, window shop, go to the
cinema or just hang out.
For many living in the enormous industrial suburbs outside the wealthy
pockets of the city and for the million or so favela residents, however,
entertainment is more likely to be centred on the local bar.
Going out is one of the city's big attractions. Sao Paulo has a wide variety
of restaurants thanks to its history of immigration, notably in the Japanese
district of Liberdade and the nearby Italian neighbourhood of Bixiga.
Paulistanos like to socialise late, often eating at 10pm, and then
frequently carry on to a bar or jazz club until the early hours of the
morning.
The city is a leading South American centre for theatre, concerts and
exhibitions. Many of Brazil's outstanding musicians regularly perform in Sao
Paulo while international performers and orchestras put on shows at the
city's opera house, the Olympia venue or open air concerts in Ibirapuera
park.
Top class football is another of Sao Paulo's leisure attractions. Despite
losing many of their world cup stars to European teams, Sao Paulo FC,
Palmeiras and Corinthians football clubs put on some of the best footballing
shows in the world at city stadiums Morumbi and Pacaembu.
To escape the pollution and stress of the city, residents need no
encouragement to head for the coast, about two hours away. The main resorts
are Guaruja, Ubatuba and Ilhabela. These are packed in the summer months,
particularly at new year and Carnival. In the winter, many make tracks for
the weekend retreat of Campos do Jordao in the mountains three hours away
from the city.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Survey of Sao Paulo (4): State looks to private sector stake
in projects - Big changes in infrastructure planning may be needed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Attempts by the financially-troubled state of Sao Paulo to privatise or
contract out public services have met with delays, legal constraints and
opposition by the state government and its companies.
But supporters of privatisation believe economic necessity will still force
a radical change in infrastructure planning. They regard the state as ripe
for development by private companies, sometimes in partnership with the
public sector, and predict billions of dollars of private investment in
projects over the coming decade.
The belief stems from Sao Paulo's attraction as the wealthiest and most
industrialised Brazilian state and the fact that the squeeze on public
finances makes building new motorways, power plants and other infrastructure
projects increasingly difficult for the state, which has a total debt of
around Dollars 31bn and a budget deficit this year of 25 per cent.
'We are seeing a shift in the balance between public and private sector,
with private companies being given more space,' says Mr Carlos Roberto
Silvestrin, executive director of the Tiete-Parana Development Agency (ADTP)
and a former commercial manager at Cesp, the state-controlled power
generation company.
The ADTP represents around 100 private and public sector companies
interested in projects in the Tiete-Parana region. This includes six
Brazilian states plus Paraguay and Bolivia, although projects are
concentrated in the key market of Sao Paulo. The ADTP envisages development
projects totalling Dollars 20bn by the end of the century, particularly in
energy but also in motorways, railways and public sanitation.
Much of the development is linked to plans for a gas pipeline between
Bolivia and Sao Paulo. The pipeline plan foresees delivery of an initial 8m
cubic metres of natural gas a day by 1997 to the Brazilian market,
particularly Sao Paulo. But financing and final feasibility studies have
still not been defined, although both sides hope to reach agreement by the
middle of next year.
Another important project is the opening to navigation of the Tiete and
Parana rivers. Cesp, which draws hydro-electric power from both rivers, says
it will complete the construction of locks along the waterway by the end of
the year, making it navigable from the heart of Sao Paulo to the border with
Paraguay and up to the Brazilian state of Goias. The ADTP believes the
waterway will become a catalyst for development of light industry and will
be helped by the Mercosul common market that starts on January 1.
Private sector involvement will be especially important in energy projects,
since Sao Paulo may encounter an 'energy deficit' by the end of the decade.
Cesp estimates that it will need to increase its installed capacity, now
about 10,000MW, by about 600MW a year to the end of the decade to cope with
demand. 'It will be impossible for the public sector to pay for this
expansion and the only alternative is to attract private investment,' says
Mr Antonio Jose Zagatto, Cesp's planning and development manager.
Although state-owned companies such as Cesp and the sanitation company
Sabesp are involved in the ADTP venture, the state government's record in
linking infrastructure projects to private investment has so far been
disappointing, according to Mr Venilton Tadini, executive director of the
Paulista Development Company.
This was created in 1992 by Sao Paulo businessmen, with the support of the
state government, to produce viability studies for public sector
concessions. At the same time the state government passed a law allowing
such concessions.
'We have worked on reports including prison privatisation and highway
concessions but often very little has happened once we have sent them to the
state,' says Mr Tadini, who blames opposition to privatisation among state
officials and politicians.
Mr Luiz Antonio Fleury, the state governor who leaves office at the end of
the year, also blames internal opposition as well as the lack of a federal
law on concessions.
The only important result of Sao Paulo's 1992 law has been the beginning of
tender processes for the concession of three stretches of motorway. Under
these, private companies will be offered toll revenues for 20 or 25 years in
return for maintaining the roads and building new stretches.
As well as resistance to change among old guard officials, other factors
that have so far restricted private involvement in infrastructure projects
include Brazil's economic instability and high inflation, which last year
hit 2,500 per cent, and the lack of a federal framework in areas such as
private energy production.
A federal government decree authorising independent power production (IPP)
has been expected for months but so far not been issued. This measure is
likely to allow private companies to build and operate power plants, selling
the electricity to state-controlled distributors and, in special cases,
directly to customers.
Mr Joao Magalhaes president of the Brazilian subsidiary of US engineering
company Bechtel, has been working on plans for an electricity station in
Paulinia, Sao Paulo, for eight months, but says that uncertainties still
include the lack of legislation and potential project finance problems.
Brazil's lack of experience in non-recourse project finance, also known as
'stand alone' schemes, under which those undertaking to build a plant are
not held liable by banks for delays or cost overruns, could prevent private
and foreign companies taking on IPP schemes, says Mr Magalhaes.
Under non-recourse financing, which was used for US independent power
plants, banks make sure projects are watertight before giving loans. In
Brazil projects often run into problems because loans are made for badly
planned projects since the banks know they can recover their money from the
building consortium whatever happens to the development of the project, he
says.
But in spite of the uncertainties Mr Magalhaes is convinced that sooner or
later Sao Paulo will have to embrace private infrastructure projects such as
IPP: 'The market is there, the big question is when it will all start
happening. I just hope they don't wait until there's an energy crisis before
taking action.'
Mr Silvestrin, while accepting that progress in developing projects could
have been quicker, argues a big change is occurring in Sao Paulo and Brazil
as a whole. The country's current economic stabilisation plan and the
probable election as president of Mr Cardoso, as well as the increasing
interest being shown by private and foreign companies projects, are all
evidence of this, he says.
'We have even signed a memorandum of understanding between the ADTP and Mr
Ron Brown, the US secretary of commerce, which shows the interest in Sao
Paulo's potential,' he says.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Survey of Sao Paulo (2): A shift in the centre of gravity -
The economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sao Paulo state remains the capitalist heart of Brazil. But its centre of
gravity is gradually shifting from a traditional industrial base towards a
diverse service economy responding to companies and consumers in what is
easily the country's biggest market.
The state's 32m people, about a fifth of Brazil's population, produce 37 per
cent of national wealth and a third of the country's exports.
Its industrial dominance was built on the state's coffee boom of the last
century, which spurred a large influx of mainly European immigrants.
Agricultural wealth combined with a growing and dynamic population fuelled
industrialisation. This accelerated in the 1950s and 1960s with the arrival
of multinational car, chemical and manufacturing companies, attracted by
government attempts to spur Brazil's industrial growth.
But today, like a heavyweight boxer who has spent too much time in the ring,
Sao Paulo's industrial punch is gradually losing its power.
Between 1980 and 1991 its economy averaged an annual growth rate of just 0.6
per cent compared to 1.4 per cent for Brazil as a whole, according to Seade,
the state's research centre. Sao Paulo's share of national wealth in GDP
terms fell from 41 to 37 per cent during the period.
The state finance ministry puts Sao Paulo's gross domestic product at
Dollars 215bn last year. But Brazil's economic statistics are often
unreliable, and output was probably lower.
The growth slowdown has been caused because other parts of Brazil,
particularly Minas Gerais and Parana in the south-east, are catching up with
Sao Paulo and attracting new industrial companies with cheap land, tax
incentives and weaker unions.
Many Paulistas, as the state's inhabitants are known, welcome the move from
the often polluting industrial companies to a more services-based economy.
Services increased their share of state domestic product from 50 to 58 per
cent between 1980 and 1991 while industry fell from 47 to 38 per cent,
according to Seade.
Agriculture has also lost importance. From a dominant position in the 1940s,
it now accounts for 3-4 per cent of domestic product, though the figure is
higher if related industries such as food processing are included.
Unemployment has increased from an average annual rate of 8 per cent during
1985-1989 to 12-15 per cent since 1990, according to non-government
statistics which include underemployment. The official estimate of
unemployment at 5.9 per cent in June is widely agreed to be too low.
Job cuts are largely due to a general restructuring in Brazilian industry
following the opening of the economy to international competition at the
beginning of the decade.
For example, the jewel in Sao Paulo's economic crown is the car industry,
which accounts for nearly 20 per cent of industrial production. Last year
Sao Paulo produced more than two-thirds of Brazil's 1.4m vehicles but with
fewer workers than in 1990 when around 900,000 vehicles were made.
Meanwhile, General Motors' Brazilian subsidiary is expected to build a new
plant for 100,000 vehicles a year outside the state, possibly in
neighbouring Minas Gerais. The company decided not to expand its plant in
Sao Jose dos Campos, Sao Paulo, because of poor labour relations, though
some industry observers believe the financial incentives offered outside Sao
Paulo were perhaps more important.
Mr Carlos Azzoni, an economist at the University of Sao Paulo and a former
planning official in the state government, says: 'Part of the problem has
been that the state government has not been as aggressive as others in
trying to attract companies.'
However, the state government has been preoccupied with financial problems,
which have made it difficult to find money to improve the state's
infrastructure, traditionally one of Sao Paulo's biggest attractions for
companies. Partnerships with the private sector are on the agenda but have
so far made limited progress. Some large projects, such as an extension to
the city's underground rail network and a clean-up of the river Tiete, are
receiving support from multinational agencies.
Mr Azzoni argues that improved transport and communications infrastructure
in other states has allowed companies to move production out of Sao Paulo,
but still retain access to its consumer market. '(Companies) will continue
to keep their head offices in Sao Paulo but open new plants where it's
cheaper,' he says.
The move from industry to services has led to Sao Paulo evolving towards a
'qualitative not a quantitative importance,' says Mr Azzoni. Nowhere in
Brazil is there such a concentration of universities, research centres and
high tech companies. About 80 per cent of Brazil's scientific and
technological research is carried out in Sao Paulo, according to Mr Pedro
Paulo Branco, director of Seade.
The success of Brazil's current stabilisation plan would give a big boost to
Sao Paulo, according to Mr Branco, who says that because of its diverse
economy, good infrastructure and well-trained workforce it can recover far
more quickly than the national economy.
Others believe stabilisation will provide only a short-term industrial
turnaround and that Brazil's economic centre of gravity is inevitably
dispersing to other regions. Similar doubts exist over the importance of the
Mercosul free trade area for the state. Some believe Mercosul will mainly
benefit states to the south of Sao Paulo, while others point to the
development of a powerful economic axis linking South America's two biggest
consumer markets: Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires.
Whatever happens, Sao Paulo will still remain in the middle of a hugely
important consumer market and industrial region, including Rio de Janeiro
and Minas Gerais to its north and developed states like Parana and Rio
Grande do Sul to its south.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Survey of Sao Paulo (1): The priority now must be to spread
wealth - Angus Foster considers the challenges and opportunities facing
Brazil's economic heartland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is sometimes tempting to imagine, sitting amid the opulence and
consumerism of central Sao Paulo, that Brazil is a developed country. The
city's rich are among Latin America's wealthiest and dine nightly at
expensive European-style restaurants. Sao Paulo's companies make satellites,
fighter aircraft and family saloon cars and are run by overseas-educated
managers. In the city's commercial areas, portable telephones and computers
are commonplace.
So it may at times be hard to understand, amid the poverty and hardship of
the city's many shanty towns, how such vicious contrasts in wealth and
opportunity can exist so close to each other. In the shanty towns, some
families go weeks without meat, spend half their monthly wages on transport
to and from work, and have to save up to telephone relatives in other
states.
But these contrasts, the result of rapid urbanisation and one of the world's
worst income disparities, are so common in Brazil that it is easy to become
immune to their implications. For Sao Paulo, which has spent the last 50
years establishing itself as the country's economic and commercial centre,
the urgent priority is to spread the wealth it is generating to a greater
number of people.
Sao Paulo state is about the size of the UK. It is home to 31m people, of
which roughly half live in and around Sao Paulo city. The state accounts for
just under 40 per cent of Brazil's output, suggesting Sao Paulo's economy is
slightly larger than Turkey's but slightly smaller than Belgium's.
Its companies are among the most dynamic in Latin America and nearly half
Brazil's biggest 50 private companies have their head offices in the state.
Its financial system has developed rapidly into the most important in South
America. Sao Paulo is home to four of Brazil's five biggest private banks,
and its stock exchange accounts for more than 90 per cent of trading in
Brazilian shares. Together, Sao Paulo companies exported more than Dollars
13bn of goods and services in 1992, more than Argentina.
Despite these impressive numbers, Sao Paulo has had a tough few years as
Brazil's overall economic crisis mounted. Deep recession from 1990 to 1992
squeezed domestic sales. Falling import tariffs opened some sectors of the
economy to foreign competition. Industry laid off more than 500,000 people
during the period as companies tried to improve productivity and adjust to
an economy slowly opening to the outside world.
The improvement in the economy last year - Brazil saw real growth of 5 per
cent - was significantly due to the car industry, one of Sao Paulo's most
important. Helped by tax cuts and pent-up demand, the car industry reported
its best year since the 1970s and production increased 30 per cent to 1.39m
units.
Industry also gained from an improvement in retail sales, and evidence that
companies were starting to invest in expanding capacity. Both trends have
accelerated this year following the launch in July of Brazil's new currency,
the Real. This has led to a sharp drop in inflation from about 50 per cent a
month to less than 5 per cent.
If Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the former finance minister who has the
support of most businessmen, wins next month's presidential elections as
expected, there is likely to be a further sharp increase in business
confidence. His main opponent, the left-winger Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva,
is opposed by business groups because of his union links and radical plans
in areas like land reform.
Whoever wins the election, the Real is the first rather than the final step
in a programme to modernise Brazil's economy. The country's creaking tax and
social security systems also need thorough reform. With the federal
government facing a mounting budget deficit from next year, and claiming it
cannot cut spending further, economic forecasting for even the short term is
difficult.
For Sao Paulo's state government, the situation is equally troubled. While
net debt has risen to Dollars 31bn, of which part was inherited from the
previous regime, the state's main source of income, state value added tax,
has fallen from Dollars 11bn in 1989 to Dollars 9bn because of economic
recession and companies moving to other states.
These financial problems have seriously undermined the capability of the
present government, under Mr Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho. They are also likely
to hamper his successor, who is due to take office in January following
elections next month. The winner is expected to be Mr Mario Covas, a former
senator for Sao Paulo and a close ally of Mr Cardoso.
Mr Carlos Eduardo Moreira Ferreira, president of the Sao Paulo Federation of
Industries, says Mr Covas will 'suffer a lot. He will have to spend the
first one and a half years recovering the government's finances. That's his
priority,' he adds.
But plenty of other priorities will land on Mr Covas's desk. Mr Vincent
Paulo da Silva, president of the CUT union congress, says: 'State
governments only act in the case of emergencies or for electoral reasons.
What we need, instead, is a government which does much more in terms of
building infrastructure and providing education.'
Mr Pedro Jacobi, who studies urban problems at the private Cedec institute
in Sao Paulo, says his research shows that people's biggest concerns are air
quality, violence and the lack of health centres. 'What is worrying is that
nearly 70 per cent of people said they expected the state to solve these
problems, even though we are being told the state must shrink and is without
the money,' he says.
Given the speed of Sao Paulo city's growth as industrialisation gathers
pace, taking the urban population from 1.3m in 1940 to 9.5m today, some of
its achievements are impressive. Illiteracy, which in the 1950s extended to
half the state's population, has fallen sharply to under 10 per cent of
persons aged 10 or more. Sao Paulo is also one of only a few states in
Brazil to have enough school places for all its children, although there are
complaints about the quality and wages of its teachers.
But the challenges now are in areas more associated with developed economies
as well. Sao Paulo needs to create secure and well-paid jobs rather than
continue to rely on an expanding informal economy. Environmental concerns
are only starting to be addressed.
Meanwhile, about 1m people still live in shanty towns, usually without
adequate sewerage, and watch as the gap between rich and poor continues to
widen. The poorest 50 per cent of Brazilians saw their share of national
income fall from 15 to 12 per cent over last decade. They now earn less than
the country's richest 1 per cent.
'What you see clearly is a level of social disintegration. It's a result of
the lack of jobs, the effects of drugs in the slums and the extent of the
social problems, and these have been increasing rapidly,' says Mr Jacobi.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Government Bonds: Gilts rise sharply on news of higher base
rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BRICE and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The surprise move by the UK chancellor Mr Kenneth Clarke to raise UK base
rates for the first time in almost five years prompted a rise of almost one
point at the long end of the UK gilt market yesterday.
The market had been falling on news of a higher than expected rise in August
factory gate prices but changed tack following the news of the half-point
rise in the base rate to 5 3/4 per cent. The change in sentiment caused
gilts to outperform other European government bond markets.
'The gilt market loved it, especially given the firm comments on tax,' said
Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg. 'There had been some
uncertainty about policy here and the market finds this very reassuring. I
would be surprised if the market didn't move ahead in the next few days.'
Mr John Shepperd at Yamaichi said: 'If we continue to get tight monetary and
tight fiscal policy, this will leave the gilt market very well placed to
outperform other European bond markets.'
He added, however, that there was still the possibility of a further
interest rate rise at the time of the November budget.
Mr Michael Saunders at Salomon Brothers said the UK economy was likely to
continue to accelerate, despite the rate rise, and forecast that the
chancellor would increase rates by another 50 basis points within the next
few months. 'This has strengthened his position in the markets,' he said.
The yield spread between gilts and bunds narrowed from around 145 basis
points on Friday to about 135 basis points yesterday.
On Liffe, the December long gilt future rose to 100 1/32 in late trading, up
 27/32 points on the day.
The timing of the rise in UK base rates caused some nervousness in
continental European bond markets because it came so hard on the heels of
Friday's publication of US wholesale prices.
The sharp increase in the August data had revived fears that the Federal
Reserve would have to raise rates again soon to curb inflation.
Most analysts said the UK move was another strong signal that no further
interest rate cuts in Europe were likely. 'The UK rate rise confirms that
the interest rate cycle has turned in Europe,' said Mr Andrew Bevan,
international bond economist at Goldman Sachs.
Immediately after the UK rate rise, the market started speculating that
Denmark would be the next country to tighten, which prompted the Danish
central bank to make an official denial that it was considering such a move.
Mr Julian Jessop, international economist at Midland Global Markets, still
believed that Germany would cut rates by a half-point before the end of the
year.
'There is no reason for the Bundesbank to raise rates until the end of next
year,' he said. He added that there was no history of the Bundesbank using
rate rises as pre-emptive strikes against inflation.
The Bundesbank is due to hold its regular meeting on Thursday but is not
expected to announce interest rate changes. It is also likely to stick with
a fixed-rate repo. 'The Bundesbank wants to give a clear indication that
things are on hold,' said Mr Bevan.
On Liffe, the December bund future rose 0.25 points to 88.96 in moderate
trading.
US Treasury bond prices dipped yesterday as traders braced themselves for
today's reading on consumer price inflation.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 3/32 at
97 1/2 , with the yield rising to 7.708 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was off  1/32 at 99 13/16 , to yield 6.334 per cent.
In the early hours of trading an uneasy calm prevailed as dealers squared up
their positions before the release of the August consumer price index this
morning.
Despite a generally negative tone, prices on the long end of the yield curve
started out a little firmer, in a corrective move that followed Friday's
huge sell-off.
However, the session was dominated by fears of inflation, which surfaced
last Friday on news of a 0.6 per cent jump in August producer prices,
compared with expectations of a 0.4 per cent rise, and bonds across the
board soon succumbed to the pessimism.
The market was concerned that the CPI would replicate the inflationary trend
in producer prices. Before the release of the PPI, a 0.4 per cent gain in
August consumer prices was forecast.
Analysts said it is likely that the intermediate and long-dated segments of
the maturity range will tumble again if the figure exceeds that level,
though a weaker than expected result could bring temporary relief.
Any improvement might prove short-lived, however. The market is facing a
barrage of economic reports later in the week, including data on retail
sales figures, industrial production and capacity utilisation.
Most observers still believe the Federal Reserve will delay its next move to
tighter credit conditions until November, despite the bad news on inflation,
but there are signs that confidence in that scenario is eroding. This week's
data should either confirm the consensus view or undermine it.

The Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES) plans to boost trading of foreign
currency-denominated stocks by allowing overseas brokers to trade the shares
directly, said finance minister Richard Hu, Reuter reports from Singapore.
The exchange will also give priority to regional stockbrokers who want to
take an equity interest in local firms, or who want to set up in Singapore
as an international member of the exchange, Mr Hu said at the Asian
Securities Analysts Council annual conference.
Mr Hu told the conference the Singapore government wanted the SES to develop
as a centre for regional securities trading, and these measures would
increase liquidity as well as improve the exchange's competitiveness.
'The SES will allow foreign brokers, who are not members of the exchange,
but which are licensed by the MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore), to
become subscribers to the trading terminals provided by the SES to deal in
stocks quoted in foreign currencies,' Mr Hu said.
Foreign brokerages will no longer have to put such transactions through an
SES member broker.

FT  13 SEP 94 / International Bonds: World Bank delays global offering until
next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The World Bank has delayed its much-anticipated Dollars 1.5bn global
offering until next week due to current market volatility and holidays in
Japan and the US, joint lead manager UBS said yesterday.
Syndicate managers were expecting the Bank to tap the five to 10-year area
of the dollar sector this week.
'They are looking at the long end of the market and with current market
volatility this is an awkward time to do it,' said one syndicate manager.
Strong US producer price figures released on Friday have increased bond
market nervousness about US consumer price data due today, UBS said. 'With
less data next week, we will get the focus of the market,' said one UBS
official.
Elsewhere in the eurobond market, activity remained subdued, with investors
nervous following the rise in UK base rates and ahead of the key US CPI data
today.
The Dollars 500m offering by Metropolis of Tokyo of 10-year eurobonds
suffered from weakness in the dollar sector, syndicate managers said.
'Markets are nervous and investors are holding back their purchases,' said
one syndicate manager. 'As a result, the offering has suffered a bit.'
The bonds, priced to yield 32 basis points over US government bonds, were
targeted mainly at Japanese institutional investors, lead manager IBJ said.
Syndicate managers described the pricing as tight; the spread widened to 35
basis points after the bonds had broken syndicate.
'The spread should have been wider but most of the paper will clear at the
34-35 level,' said one manager.
Market sources said the proceeds from the offering were swapped back into
yen.
France Telecom launched its first eurobond outside the French and Swiss
franc sectors with a L150bn issue of three-year bonds.
Lead manager Swiss Bank Corporation reported strong demand from retail
investors in the Swiss and Benelux areas and some French institutional
interest. 'The lira market is currently very retail-driven and offers
tremendous arbitrage,' said one manager.
Dresdner Bank launched a FFr2bn offering of four-year bonds, priced to yield
18 basis points over French government bonds.

FT  13 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Lufthansa shares priced at
DM160
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lufthansa, the German national airline, yesterday set a subscription price
of DM160 each for its 7.64m new ordinary shares, in line with market
expectations. Lufthansa's shares closed at DM200 yesterday, up DM3 from
Friday.
The airline will raise around DM1.2bn by offering shareholders one new share
for every four held. The new shares will be provided with full dividend
rights for the 1994 business year.
Last month Lufthansa said it expected to make an operating profit this year
and confirmed earlier suggestions that it would resume dividend payments for
the first time since 1989.
The German government will not be participating in the rights issue, thereby
reducing its stake in Lufthansa from 51.4 per cent to about 41 per cent.
The 3.9m shares which the government will not be taking up will be sold to
investors at home and abroad, excluding the US, via a syndicate of
international banks led by Dresdner Bank.
If demand is sufficiently buoyant, the government also intends to sell 2.1m
existing shares which would further reduce its stake to around 36 per cent.
The price of these shares will be set on September 29. They are expected to
be priced at a small discount to the prevailing market price.
The subscription period for the new shares will run from September 20 to
October 4. As a result of the rights issue, the airline's ordinary share
capital will increase by a nominal DM382m to DM1.9bn.
At the annual meeting in July, Lufthansa's shareholders authorised the
executive board to increase the company's capital by a nominal DM515m.
'With the consent of the supervisory board, the executive board has now made
partial use of this authorisation,' Lufthansa said. Another rights issue is
expected to take place next year.

FT  13 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Europe faces Ecu225m bank
charge - The cost may be only one of many disruptions caused by a move to
monetary union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The possibility that a move to European monetary union (Emu) could cost
large European banks up to Ecu225m (Dollars 278m) each is the most daunting
conclusion of research carried out by the Ecu Banking Association. But the
cost is only one of many disruptions faced by banks moving to Emu.
As the study points out, the effect on banks of moving to monetary union is
comparable to large scale deregulation. It will involve massive technical
changes, elimination of some markets and the growth of others, and large
changes to banks' funding methods and strategy for European operations.
Furthermore, banks in the core group of European countries that move to
monetary union by the turn of the century may be in a better position than
those outside. Exclusion from Emu could raise funding costs, lower credit
ratings and form a large hurdle to operating efficiency.
Given this large list of obstacles, it appears surprising at first that
bankers involved in the study group should have emphasised their enthusiasm
for the idea yesterday. But the report concludes that banks could gain
comparative advantage by embracing the idea quickly and comprehensively.
A move to monetary union could challenge traditional methods of banking in
Europe in a number of ways:
Foreign exchange trading among different European countries will disappear,
wiping out an important source of income not only from cash markets but also
sales of financial derivatives to hedge currency risks. In their place will
be put a larger market for exchange of Ecu with dollars and yen.
Correspondent banking - in which banks have partners in other countries to
perform payment transactions in local currency - will be replaced by
bilateral or multilateral payment arrangements in Ecu. This could affect
traditional profits from fees, and 'float' income on cash sums.
Local money markets, bond markets and credit markets, which are supported by
local payment and settlement services will be replaced by an Emu-sized
market, bound by one currency. This will change the scale at which many
banks operate, forcing them to re-define operations.
Retail banks will have to re-state historical data on customer accounts in
Ecu after monetary union, as well as altering technology and producing new
transfer forms and cheque books. They will also have to make big changes to
comply with alterations in clearing systems.
The transition costs will be higher if governments avoid a 'big bang'
approach in which currencies within monetary union disappear - perhaps over
a weekend. If they choose to allow a 'dual currency' system with local
currencies running alongside the Ecu for a time, costs would be higher.
Bankers yesterday pointed out that costs of transition could vary
considerably depending on the legislative approach. For example, if European
legislation allows all outstanding loans to be re-stated in Ecu rather than
being individually re-negotiated, it avoids large one-off costs.
Yet the banks within monetary union will at least be able to comfort
themselves that most costs are transitional, and that they may be able to
exert a competitive advantage on outsiders after union. The most worrying
fate faces banks whose currency is excluded from the union.
A study of the impact on banks in countries outside Emu, prepared by Mr Jaun
Moro of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, argues that such banks will suffer competitive
disadvantage in lacking a stable Ecu funding base. This will compress their
margins if they lend at similar spreads to Emu-based banks.
Mr Moro argued that banks from non-integrated countries risk being
downgraded by credit rating agencies because they are exposed to 'second
tier currencies'. They will also have to use 'massive amounts of hard
currency' as an alternative to their domestic currency, so raising their
costs.
This could have considerable implications for large banks in countries such
as the UK, Ireland and Denmark which could be left behind in the initial
move to monetary union. UK banks with large cross-border businesses, such as
NatWest and Barclays, could be severely affected.
Mr Olivier Mas, chairman of the association, emphasised that banks are
likely to be impelled to start thinking of the Ecu area as their domestic
market. This is likely to lead to a re-consideration of cross-border
partnerships, particularly on payment systems.
As Mr Mas said, London is the leading centre for Ecu clearing in Europe
despite the UK government's attitude to monetary union. Yet UK banks could
face difficulties in maintaining their grip on Ecu clearing and financial
markets if they were operating sterling as a dual currency.
This could lead to Emu changing the balance of power among banks that want
to be forces in Europe. Those from non-Emu countries would have to fight
harder against those which would gain funding advantages, and the backing of
the hardest currency.

FT  13 SEP 94 / International Company News: Hoyts sells cinema side to
US-led consortium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT and Agencies
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A consortium led by Hellmann &amp; Friedman Capital Partners, a US investment
banking firm, is to buy the cinema interests of the privately-owned Hoyts
entertainments company, which has theatres in Australia, New Zealand and the
US.
No purchase price for the Australian group, owned by the Melbourne-based
Fink family, has been revealed, although a spokesman for the US firm
suggested it might be as high as ADollars 500m (USDollars 372m).
The sale supersedes plans to float the Hoyts business on the stock market.
These were announced in June, when Hoyts indicated that it was hoping to
raise about ADollars 400m.
At the time, Mr David Clarke, the company's chairman, suggested that the
group might consider expansion into south-east Asia, particularly China.
South America, and the Mexican market in particular, could also offer new
opportunities, he added.
In a statement yesterday, Hellmann &amp; Friedman indicated that it supported
this assessment: 'A well-capitalised Hoyts has exciting expansion
opportunities in its existing markets as well as in Asia and Latin America,'
it said.
Hoyts claims to be the 10th largest US cinema operator, with 79 cinemas  -
mainly on the east coast - and 519 screens. In Australia, it is the third
largest operator, taking about a quarter of the country's box-office
receipts.
The Fink family has owned Hoyts since 1985, and had planned to retain a
small interest. At the time of the flotation announcement, Hoyts' pre-tax
earnings were forecast at some ADollars 63m in the 1994 financial year.

APN bid

<TEXT>
Australian Provincial Newspapers, the chain of regional newspapers
controlled by Mr Tony O'Reilly, the Irish businessman, has launched a
ADollars 106m (USDollars 79m) cash bid for Wesgo, the radio company which
operates stations in eastern and South Australia.
APN picked up a 14.8 per cent stake in Wesgo on Sunday, following talks
between the companies, and Wesgo immediately recommended the ADollars 1.90 a
share offer when it was announced yesterday.
The radio company had been facing a rival bid from Sunshine Broadcasting
Network, which valued it at about ADollars 90m. By yesterday afternoon,
however, Sunshine had sold its stake in Wesgo to APN.
Amcor, the Melbourne-based packaging, paper and pulp group, has announced
its first move into Indonesia. It will take a 55 per cent stake in Indopack
Pratama, which is owned by Pakerin, a private paper and packaging group.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
General Motors' GM Hughes Electronics unit has announced that a
consolidation of its defence-related business will result in the loss of
about 4,400 jobs by 1995, and the closure of its facilities in Fullerton,
California. The company said that no restructuring charges are planned.
GM Hughes, which announced in March that it was preparing to combine its
electronics and defence operations in a newly-formed Hughes Aerospace and
Electronics subsidiary, said the cuts were essential in the face of
declining defence spending.
'Today, the Department of Defense and our foreign customers are even more
cost-driven and Hughes must change to meet those new priorities,' said Mr
Michael Armstrong, chairman and chief executive of GM Hughes Electronics.
The aerospace and defence, missile systems and systems sectors of Hughes
Aircraft, which currently has 51,000 employees, will be combined with the
Delco Systems operations of the Delco Electronics unit of GM Hughes. Last
year these businesses together accounted for nearly Dollars 7bn of GMHE's
Dollars 13.5bn revenues.
The new company will have its headquarters in Washington, DC. The plan calls
for about 3m sq ft of office and manufacturing space to be vacated in the
next 18 months, with Hughes phasing out its 286-acre complex in Fullerton
and offering the property for sale. Operations will transfer to other
facilities and the systems sector activities in Fullerton will be
consolidated in local leased facilities.
'We intend to make this new company a growth company through prudent
acquisitions, intelligent investment in new product development and changes
in our cost structure and approach to business,' Mr Michael Smith, who has
been named chairman of Hughes Aerospace and Electronics, said.

FT  13 SEP 94 / International Company News: Coles Myers denies buy-out hitch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coles Myers, one of Australia's largest retailers, has moved quickly in an
attempt to quash suggestions that its planned buy-out of the 21.45 per stake
in its equity currently held by Kmart, the US stores group, was running into
shareholder opposition.
In a statement to the stock exchange yesterday, Coles said it had received
almost 12,000 proxies, covering more than one-fifth of its shares. It said
these were overwhelmingly in favour of the deal.
Coles, which is due to release its profit figures today, added that 'the
company's chairman and chief executive officer have recently visited many of
the major institutional shareholders . . . and the response to the proposed
transaction . . . has been consistently and overwhelmingly supportive and
affirmative'.
The deal comprises a direct buy-back and cancellation of just under half the
Kmart stake, and the possible purchase of a Kmart subsidiary which holds the
remaining 11.45 per cent, with the method of disposal for these shares yet
to be decided. A meeting to approve the deal has been called for September
19.
However, Coles' task of persuading shareholders to back the deal has not
been made easier by its falling share price, which closed down another 12
cents at ADollars 3.98 yesterday, compared with the ADollars 4.55 at which
the Kmart interests would be bought in.
Conversely, the fact that directors and associates own or control around 28
per cent of the equity could be to Coles' advantage.

1.7bn

<TEXT>
Telstra, the state-owned Australian telecommunications group which is known
as Telecom in its own country, made a profit of ADollars 1.7bn (USDollars
1.3bn) in the year to end-June, a sharp increase on the ADollars 904.8m of
the previous 12 months, and a record for any Australian corporation.
Revenues were 5.6 per cent higher at ADollars 13.4bn.
Part of the improvement was due to a reduction in abnormal items - down to
ADollars 277.4m from almost ADollars 500m, and a fall in interest charges to
ADollars 748m from ADollars 921m a year ago.
However, Telstra also said that earnings before interest and tax had
increased by 13.2 per cent, in spite of increasing competition as the
Australian telecommunications market is opened up and Telstra's monopoly
dismantled.
The return on equity, before abnormals, was 18.3 per cent, 'in line with
other successful world telecommunications companies'.
In spite of the figures, Mr Frank Blount, Telstra's American chief
executive, made clear that he expected competition to intensify and
indicated that the group - much criticised in the past for its poor service
levels - had further to go in reaching the highest international standards.
'We are not there yet, and we cannot afford to relax for a moment,' he said.
He declined to be drawn on the debate about the possible privatisation of
Telstra.
'It's a matter for the shareholder,' he said, noting that the federal
government has said that such a move 'is not on the agenda in the term of
this government'.
However, Mr Blount said he welcomed last week's final break-up of the 'PMT'
consortium - the alliance of Telecom, Mr Rupert Murdoch and Mr Kerry Packer
 -which was formed to pursue pay-TV opportunities in Australia.
This freed Telstra to pursue other alliances, he indicated. 'We're talking
to other programming and content people and services providers. We have
discussions going with at two or three parties in Australia and some that
are not in Australia,' he said.

<TEXT>
Dominion Mining, the Perth-based miner which earlier this year saw off a bid
from Gold Mines of Australia, yesterday reported a ADollars 52.7m (USDollars
39.2m) loss after abnormals in the year to end-June, compared with a deficit
of ADollars 127.1m in the previous year, writes Nikki Tait.
There was a small operating profit before abnormals and tax of ADollars
4.29m, down from ADollars 15.1m previously.
Dominion was loss-making in the second half, which the company said was due
to 'insufficient operating margins' at the Cosmo Howley and Bannockburn gold
mines, and high amortisation charges here, reflecting short mine lives.
The bottom-line loss for the year also reflects a ADollars 56.9m abnormal
charge, which includes a ADollars 29.3m write-down of gold operations and a
ADollars 17.8m write-off of capitalisation exploration expenditure.
GIO Australia, which was privatised by the New South Wales government and is
one of Australia's largest general insurers, reported after-tax profits of
ADollars 126.1m for the year to end-June, up by 22.3 per cent, writes Nikki
Tait.
The result, however, was aided by a reduced tax charge, and operating profit
before tax rose more modestly from ADollars 157.1m to ADollars 163.2m.
Berjaya, one of Malaysia's biggest conglomerates, intends to sell its 20.5
per cent stake in Star Publications, publishers of The Star, one of
Malaysia's leading English-language daily newspapers, writes Kieran Cooke in
Kuala Lumpur.
Star Publications also has a wide range of magazines.
Berjaya said that its stake in Star Publications would be sold for a total
of MDollars 60m (USDollars 23.4m).
Mr Vincent Tan, head of the Berjaya group, has recently launched The Sun, an
English-language daily, in Malaysia.

FT  13 SEP 94 / International Company News: Divided family set to vote on
McCain's future

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sparks are certain to fly at a shareholders' meeting, scheduled for today,
of McCain Foods, at which members of New Brunswick's feuding McCain family
are due to take important decisions on the future of the multinational
frozen foods maker.
Family members are expected to vote on a proposal to oust Mr Wallace McCain
as joint chief executive, leaving his older brother Harrison as sole chief
executive pending the appointment of an outsider to head the company. The
two brothers would continue as non-executive chairman and deputy chairman.
Wallace has strongly resisted the move. He has proposed that the McCain
family should instead spin off part of the company to the public, and that
he and Harrison should step down at the same time.
Wallace yesterday asked a New Brunswick court to endorse his strategy. The
outcome of the shareholders' meeting depends on these court proceedings.
Although McCain is a private company, members of the family have
increasingly vented their anger through public court documents, press
releases and leaked letters. Wallace alleged in an affidavit submitted to
yesterday's court hearing that none of the second-generation family members
who comprise the board of McCain Foods holding company has 'the character,
ability, business experience, judgment or acumen to direct and manage (its)
affairs.'
He alleged that McCain's extensive UK and European activities, which are
under Harrison's control, are performing poorly, compared to the North
American and Australasian operations, which are under his own control.
According to the affidavit, the European businesses suffered a loss in July
'for the first time in many years'.
One leaked document has revealed that McCain posted profits of CDollars
84.3m (USDollars 61.6m) last year on worldwide sales of CDollars 2.7bn. But
Mr Harrison McCain said in a memo to employees last week that 'all the
shareholders, except Wallace's family, think that Wallace and I . . . should
make way for a new, independent CEO who will run the company
professionally.'
Wallace, Harrison and their respective families each own one third of McCain
Foods, with the remaining third split between the children of their two
deceased brothers. One issue that has arisen in the search for an outside
chief executive is whether the newcomer will be willing to keep McCain's
head office in the picturesque hamlet of Florenceville, New Brunswick, where
Harrison and Wallace McCain built their first potato processing plant in
1956.
Harrison McCain stressed the importance of finding the best candidates, 'not
just the ones who agree with restrictions imposed on them beforehand'. He
indicated that his opposition to taking the company public was partly based
on a fear that control might eventually pass to faraway institutional
shareholders with little interest in maintaining links with Florenceville.

Banco Santander, the Spanish bank, has accepted the resignation of Mr
Rodrigo Echenique, the chief executive, as part of wider management changes
at the bank, AFX reports from Madrid.
The bank said Mr Echenique, who also headed its brokerage arm Banco
Santander de Negocios, would remain on the bank's board. It offered no
reason for his resignation.
Santander said Ms Ana Patricia Botin will replace Mr Echenique as chief
executive of its brokerage arm and will also become a general director of
the bank. It did not refer to the vacant post of chief executive.
The bank has named Mr Juan Rodriguez Inciarte as its director responsible
for finance, which includes management of the group's treasury, capital
markets and investment fund operations.
Dealers said the changes at the bank's treasury and capital markets were
widely expected after these divisions posted large first-half losses.
Santander said it had appointed Mr Matias Rodriguez Inciarte as its second
vice-president, responsible for retail banking, human resources and
planning.
Mr Casto de la Mora Mata has been appointed director responsible for retail
banking division, while Mr Jose Antonio Villasante del Cerro will replace
him as head of Santander's Madrid operations.

FT  13 SEP 94 / International Company News: Blocked bank bid leaves bruises
all round - Few emerge with credit from BCP's unsuccessful attempt to win
BPA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No one has emerged from the battle for Banco Portugues do Atlantico with a
convincing victory. Banco Comercial Portugues, whose hostile bid for
Portugal's second largest bank has been vetoed by the government, is the
most prominent loser.
But little glory has attached to the other main forces in the struggle.
BCP, which has earned a reputation for almost flawless management since it
was founded in 1985, will suffer for its political misjudgement.
The government has sullied its pro-market credentials. BPA's management is
under fire for lacking direction and the soundness of the relationship
between core shareholders and the bank has been called into question.
As for the securities exchange commission (CMVM), it has been exposed as
slow-moving and hampered by bureaucratic regulations.
Portugal's capital markets will not benefit from the badly-needed boost
expected from BCP's Es132bn (Dollars 838m) offer for 40 per cent of BPA.
In addition, traders fear the international image of the Lisbon market may
have been damaged by the six-week process that culminated with a government
decision to block the bid.
BPA shareholders have been the first to suffer. Shares fell to Es2,260 at
the close yesterday, the first day of trading since they were suspended by
the CMVM on August 10. After BCP announced its offer of Es3,000 a share on
July 26, the shares had climbed 31.8 per cent to Es2,650 before they were
suspended out of concern that a disorderly market could develop. BCP shares
also closed at Es2,260 yesterday, down 1.74 points from Friday.
Lisbon dealers said the CMVM's long suspension of BPA shares had prevented
small shareholders from taking advantage of their first opportunity for
making gains since the bank began to be privatised in 1990. They fear the
bid has shown Portugal's capital markets to be burdened with an overly
bureaucratic regulatory framework that could deter foreign investors.
BCP was putting on a brave face yesterday. Mr Jorge Jardim Goncalves,
chairman, said the bank's determination to expand remained unaltered. But it
is not clear where he will look next.
The government decision has left BCP, Portugal's fifth largest bank, still
straining at the leash. Unable to build a market share consonant with its
strong capital accumulation through organic growth alone, it has been trying
to expand by acquisition. But the finance ministry has so far blocked its
every move.
In January, the government rejected BCP's bid for Banco Pinto e Sotto Mayor,
the sixth-ranked bank, as too low. A second attempt to privatise BPSM will
be made later this year. But Mr Jardim Goncalves said yesterday BCP was no
longer interested.
BCP control of BPA would have increased its market share from 9.5 per cent
to 24 per cent in a single blow. BCP will now have to resign itself to more
gradual expansion, either by redirecting its sights on smaller takeover
targets or by starting a new banking operation, its eighth, from scratch.
The expansion envisaged by BCP is of the kind often promoted by the
centre-right government of prime minister Anbal Cavaco Silva, who regularly
expresses support for the building of strong Portuguese companies able to
compete at a European level.
The government's decision that a BCP takeover of BPA could destabilise the
financial system has drawn strong criticism from a majority of Lisbon
analysts and opposition parties. They say the veto is an unwelcome
interference in the free operation of the market and a brake on the capacity
of Portuguese banks to gain critical mass.
The government's other main argument is that BCP's planned acquisition would
have perturbed the privatisation strategy mapped out for BPA. The state
still owns 24.5 per cent. BPA's core shareholders, a group of 13 Portuguese
companies that owns 28.7 per cent, say the government has made an unwritten
commitment to keep them in control after the final stage of privatisation,
for which no date has been set.
Praise may be due to the government for keeping faith with the core
shareholders and sticking to a pledge to disperse BPA's capital widely among
small investors. But BCP's bid has indicated the uncertainties to which the
protracted privatisation of BPA and other banks has exposed Portugal's
financial system. Rival bids from BCP and BPA's main shareholders for the
remaining state holding would also have almost certainly increased the value
of the stake.
BPA's management has the most reasons to toast the government decision. It
has survived - but far from unscathed. BCP's offer has shown the management
team of Mr Joao Oliveira, chairman, to have been slow in implementing a
strategic restructuring of the bank.
BCP supporters claim the core shareholders tolerated relatively passive
management in return for favourable treatment. Whether or not this is true,
the core shareholders will now press hard for more aggressive management.
They are expected to nominate eight non-executive board members at an
extraordinary meeting on October 6, when the board will be expanded from
seven to 15 members. The core shareholders are not currently represented.

expansion plan with Dollars 520m cash acquisition

<TEXT>
United Healthcare, one of the largest managed healthcare companies in the
US, announced a Dollars 520m cash deal yesterday, the latest in a series of
acquisitions aimed at expanding into new markets across the country.
United has agreed to buy GenCare Health Systems, which operates in St Louis,
Missouri, with revenues last year of Dollars 197m.
The purchase is being made with part of the Dollars 2.3bn United received
from the sale of its pharmacy benefit management company, Diversified
Pharmaceutical Services, to SmithKline Beecham earlier this year.
The company made clear at the time that it planned to use the money to
continue buying regional healthcare companies.
At the end of June, United had Dollars 2.6bn of cash and securities, giving
it the resources to accelerate its acquisition programme. Earlier this year
it made two all-stock acquisitions, worth around Dollars 900m at yesterday's
market price.
GenCare operates managed healthcare programmes in St Louis, including health
maintenance organisations, with 194,000 members; preferred provider
organisations, with 98,000 members; a workers' compensation plan covering
41,000 people; and a dental programme with 31,400.
The consolidation of the managed care industry is rapidly throwing up a
small number of big companies with the power to negotiate lower prices from
hospital groups, drugs companies and other healthcare providers.
GenCare's shares closed up Dollars 6 1/2 at Dollars 46, while United
Healthcare's shares slipped by Dollars 3/4 to Dollars 53.

Kimberly-Clark, the US paper group best known for its branded tissue
products, plans to dispose of its pulp and newsprint businesses. Analysts
said the potential sale or spin-off of the commodity operations could raise
as much as Dollars 700m.
The company is evaluating the options for divesting a pulp mill in Terrace
Bay, Ontario, and its pulp and newsprint mill in Coosa Pines, Alabama. It
said it was considering both a sale and an initial public stock offering.
Kimberly-Clark's pulp and paper operations supply the company with its raw
paper materials. They have been sluggish performers during a prolonged
recession in pulp and paper prices, but the pulp and newsprint markets have
seen a sharp price rebound.
The sale of the Coosa and Terrace Bay operations would enable Kimberly-Clark
to focus on global expansion of its consumer products businesses. It is a
strong competitor to Procter &amp; Gamble for branded personal paper products in
the US, but has a smaller overseas presence.
Last year the company formed new subsidiaries or joint ventures to
manufacture and market consumer products in Argentina, Venezuela, China,
Indonesia, India and the Middle East.

FT  13 SEP 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney's Saudi rescuer may
enlarge 9.65% holding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Prince Al-Waleed, the Saudi financier who earlier this year rode to the
rescue of the ailing Euro Disney leisure group in its emergency financial
restructuring, has emerged with a 9.65 per cent stake in the company.
The prince is expected to augment this holding, which is owned by United
Saudi Commercial Bank (USCB), one of his main investment vehicles, by
triggering agreements to buy additional Euro Disney shares from Walt Disney,
its US parent, and Caisse des Depots et Consignations, the state-controlled
French financial institution.
Prince Al-Waleed, a member of the Saudi royal family and one of the Middle
East's most aggressive investors, stunned the stock market in early June by
unveiling plans to acquire up to 24.63 per cent of Euro Disney.
He undertook to buy any shares left on the market after the FFr6bn (Dollars
1.1bn) rights issue which was a vital component of the restructuring.
Ironically, the prince's arrival boosted investor confidence and the rights
issue was more heavily subscribed than many observers had expected. As a
result, Prince Al-Waleed is likely to raise his stake through his agreements
to buy additional shares from Walt Disney and the Caisse.
He can acquire up to 5.22 per cent of Euro Disney from the Caisse at the
rights issue price of FFr10.00 per share, and is also able to buy more
shares from Walt Disney, to take the USCB stake up to its 24.63 per cent
ceiling.
Euro Disney is struggling to improve its performance, and there has been
speculation that attendance levels at the EuroDisneyland theme park have
been poor in the current financial year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Castle Energy group of companies has completed the first of two steps in
its settlement with Germany's troubled Metallgesellschaft group in a complex
series of contracts between them, Reuter reports from Radnor, Pennsylvania.
The US group said Metallgesellschaft had transferred 3.6m of its Castle
Energy shares to Castle Energy, leaving it with about 1m shares (of about
7.6m shares issued and outstanding). In payment for the shares, Castle
Energy has transferred to Metallgesellschaft certain participations it holds
in debt to Metallgesellschaft.
In the second step, Metallgesellschaft will cancel some Castle Energy debt
obligations and assume some of its third party debt, together totalling
about Dollars 375m.
Metallgesellschaft will also transfer its remaining 1m Castle Energy shares,
a Dollars 5.5m debenture convertible into 500,000 shares, and Castle Energy
warrants that it holds.
Castle Energy will retain its natural gas business, free of any interests of
Metallgesellschaft. Finally, Metallgesellschaft will issue to Castle Energy
a Dollars l0m interest-bearing note payable in three years.
Castle Energy will also cancel Metallgesellschaft obligations under
agreements effective from February 1995. Metallgesellschaft will continue to
provide working capital to Castle Energy for the operation of its two oil
refineries until March 31 1995.
The first step of the restructuring was consented to by Metallgesellschaft's
banks. The second step remains subject to the banks' approval, as well as
certain other conditions, the company said.

FT  13 SEP 94 / International Company News: Bekaert posts sharp advance at
six months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Consolidated profits at Bekaert, the Belgian wire and steel cord producer,
leapt to BFr5.1bn (Dollars 157m) in the first six months of the year,
compared with BFr951m in the same period a year ago.
The result was inflated by a capital gain of BFr3.7bn from the sale of 12.1m
shares in BMA-Bridgestone Metalpha Corporation, formerly BSB. Without this,
consolidated profits were BFr1.4bn, 48 per cent up over the same period in
1993.
Bekaert said the rise, excluding the capital gain, was partly due to
improved economic conditions - particularly in the US - but more to 'the
continued internal efforts started in previous years', particularly the
group's total quality management programme.
Consolidated turnover increased by 12.8 per cent to BFr31.4bn in the period,
while cash flow reached BFr7.2bn, including the capital gain from the share
sale. Without it, cash flow was BFr3.58bn.
Combined sales volume for the consolidated and associated companies
increased by 7.9 per cent compared with the first half of 1993, but growth
came entirely from the consolidated companies which lifted sales by 10.5 per
cent.
Sales volume of associated companies was flat due to poor economic
conditions in some Latin American countries, in particular Brazil and
Venezuela. The contribution of the associated companies fell 25 per cent.
Capital spending for the consolidated companies was BFr2bn in the first half
of the year, little changed from the BFr1.9bn in the same period of 1993.
An interim dividend before withholding tax of BFr134.68 per share will be
paid. For the ordinary shares this represents a net dividend of BFr100 per
share.

FT  13 SEP 94 / International Company News: Digital seeks to ease fears over
its future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE

   BARCELONA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Digital Equipment, the troubled US computer manufacturer, plans to announce
a comprehensive new technology strategy within two months.
The aim is to reassure customers and financial analysts concerned about the
group's future in the light of four consecutive years of losses.
For the fiscal year to end-June 1994, the company reported net losses of
Dollars 2.16bn after restructuring charges, against a fiscal 1993 loss of
Dollars 251m, and revenues of Dollars 13.4m, down 6 per cent on 1993.
The plan will complement the restructuring strategy put in place earlier
this year by Mr Robert Palmer, chief executive, which is expect-ed to lead
to some 20,000 job losses, reducing the workforce to less than 60,000
people.
Mr Enrico Pesatori, head of the computer systems division which is the
largest part of Digital's operations, said that the new strategy would be
made public by the middle of November.
The chief element is expected to centre on Digital's new technology, a
family of microprocessors called Alpha, generally recognised as one of the
world's most powerful microprocessors. Digital has tied its future largely
to the success of Alpha, but so far the chip has failed to dominate the
market in the way the company had expected.
Alpha is based on reduced instruction set computing (Risc) technology and
competes with similar devices from IBM, Sun Microsystems and Silicon
Graphics, as well as with microprocessors sold by Intel, the leading
semiconductor manufacturer.
Digital's top management agrees that the next two years will be critical for
Alpha, which they accept has proved to be ahead of its time. Their worry is
that their lead with Alpha will be lost as Intel improves its Cisc
processors.
Last week Digital unveiled the latest Alpha processor, the first capable of
carrying out 1bn instructions a second and up to five times faster than
competing microprocessors.
Critics argue that the company has been rash to place so much reliance on a
single technology. Mr Pesatori said, however, that sales of Alpha technology
reached Dollars 1bn last year and were growing at a rate of 100 per cent a
year.
Acceptance of Alpha in the market remains the main problem. Digital's recent
decision to sell its stake in Olivetti has been attributed partly to the
Italian company's failure to sell more Alpha-based systems.
Mr Pesatori said the company's investment in Alpha designs would carry it
through to the first years of the next century while its investment in
manufacturing facilities for the chip could be defrayed by alliances with
other manufacturers anxious to make use of the latest process technology.
He said there had been a significant improvement in Digital's financial
performance. Revenues for the current quarter were ahead of the recovery
plan and he expected to break even by the end of the year. The company would
be profitable by the end of the second quarter next year.

Oppenheimer &amp; Co, the New York investment bank, and Nikko Securities
International are expected next week to launch an investment fund to invest
mainly in companies in the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic Fund, which will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange
and the Osaka Securities Exchange, plans to raise at least Dollars 45m,
though the final figure could be higher depending on investor demand.
The fund will have a minimum of 65 per cent of its assets invested in Czech
securities, with the balance in other central European countries, including
Austria, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland. The objective is long-term capital
appreciation.
Shares in the fund, priced at Dollars 15 each, are expected to be offered to
investors on September 26 in the US, Japan and internationally.
Quest for Value Advisors and Advantage Advisers, both part of Oppenheimer,
have been appointed investment adviser and investment manager respectively
to the fund. The fund's regional adviser is BAI Fondsberatung, a subsidiary
of Bank Austria Investment Bank.
The Czech Republic is the main focus of investment funds targeted at
emerging central European markets. Last week, the Robert Fleming-managed
Czech and Slovak Investment Corporation said it was raising up to Dollars
25m dollars in additional capital for investment mainly in Czech securities.
The country is the only post-communist country to win an investment grade
rating from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.

Swire Pacific, the Hong Kong conglomerate, has acquired a 39.2 per cent
stake in Carlsberg Brewery Hong Kong, formerly a joint venture between
Carlsberg, the Danish brewery group, and the East Asiatic Company, the
Danish-based trading group with interests in the Asia-Pacific region.
The Hong Kong brewer has also signed a memorandum of understanding to
acquire a 99 per cent share in Huizhou Brewing Company, in China's Guangdong
province.
'The new agreements, and not least the co-operation with the Swire Group,
will contribute to our prospects of continued growth, especially in China,'
said Mr Poul Svanholm, Carlsberg's chief executive.
'The China potential is considerable, but it is also a very demanding task
which initially requires quite substantial investments, inter alia in
marketing and distribution. Satisfactory levels of profitability can hardly
be expected in the immediate future,' he added.
The East Asiatic Company, which is restructuring after suffering heavy
losses in recent years, will reduce its half share in the Hong Kong brewery
to 20 per cent, with Carlsberg owning 40.8 per cent and Swire 39.2 per cent.
The financial details of this deal and the acquisition of Huizhou Brewery
were not released.
The Carlsberg parent has turnover of about DKr16bn (Dollars 250m) and beer
sales total about 27m hectolitres, of which 22m are sold outside Denmark.
Production by the Hong Kong brewery is about 48m litres, sold mainly in Hong
Kong and Singapore, with Carlsberg claiming an 18 per cent share of both
these markets.
The Huizhou Brewery, which was founded by the Australian Bond Group and has
been bought from Tomson Group, listed in Hong Kong, has production capacity
of about 60m litres.

<TEXT>
American Express will continue to seek large acquisitions in the business
travel market following the purchase of parts of the Thomas Cook travel
agency business for Dollars 375m.
'There are obviously large acquisition candidates out there,' said Mr Roger
Ballou, head of American Express's Travel Services group. 'We're not ruling
(anyone) out. We remain committed to building the business worldwide.'
Yesterday's deal brings to American Express Thomas Cook's international
business travel agency operations, which had revenues of Dollars 1.1bn last
year, and the combined business and leisure travel agency operations in the
US, with revenues of Dollars 1.9bn.
The bulk of the US revenues come from the business side, Mr Ballou said. The
US business is being acquired from Mr David Paresky, who has operated it
under licence from Thomas Cook.
The acquisition in the US will add to American Express's leading market
share there, while the non-US Thomas Cook operations give it a strong market
position, particularly in Canada, Australia, Germany and the UK.
Although Mr Ballou would not comment on which countries American Express
would look to next for acquisitions, the financial services group is widely
expected to target the Far East.
American Express added that it had begun to contact Thomas Cook's biggest
corporate customers over the weekend and had received a positive response to
the acquisition from all the companies it had spoken to.
It is almost certain to lose the account of rival plastic card company
MasterCard, however.
Thomas Cook will retain all rights to its brand name and will invest its
share of the Dollars 375m in expanding its existing travellers cheque,
foreign exchange and leisure travel businesses, according to Mr Christopher
Rodrigues, the company's chief executive.
Mr Rodrigues refused to comment on whether Thomas Cook would re-enter the US
leisure travel market through another licensing agreement.

FT  13 SEP 94 / International Company News: CS cancels Creditanstalt stake
bid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CS Holding, the international financial services group built around Credit
Suisse, has withdrawn its offer to acquire a large minority stake in
Creditanstalt, Austria's second largest bank.
CS said it had become increasingly difficult to discuss the merits of its
proposal objectively in Austria. 'Other aspects, predominantly of a
political nature, have prevailed,' it said.
Austria is in the midst of a national election campaign, and the future of
Creditanstalt has become a divisive issue between the Conservative and
Social Democratic parties, the governing coalition partners.
CS's withdrawal comes only a week after the Austrian government engaged JP
Morgan, the New York investment bank, to review bids for part of its 70 per
cent voting stake in Creditanstalt.
JP Morgan is a main rival of First Boston, a subsidiary of CS, in global
investment banking markets.
Mr Ferdinand Lacina, the Austrian finance minister who had initially been a
strong supporter of the CS bid, has recently appeared to distance himself
from it, falling in line with other Social Democratic party leaders who say
that Austrian influence in Creditanstalt must be maintained.
Mr Lacina said he regretted the withdrawal of CS. The Swiss group's offer
would have provided a sensible international solution for Creditanstalt. But
CS's move was understandable in the light of the opposition of Austrian
Conservative party forces, he said.
This opposition crystalised in June when Mr Rainer Gut, the CS chairman,
said CS would like ultimately to own 100 per cent of Creditanstalt.
The CS withdrawal leaves the future of Creditanstalt uncertain. A large
consortium formed mainly from Austrian Conservative party business circles
to counter CS's bid last spring could well fall apart now the threat of a
foreign takeover has disappeared.
If so, the finance minister would be left with no concrete bids to consider.
Allianz, the German insurance group, has indicated an interest but would
probably face similar opposition to that faced by CS if it made a formal
offer.
The government has been committed to sell its remaining stake in
Creditanstalt for several years.
In the early 1990s, the bank's poor performance dampened interest from
potential strategic partners and institutional investors.
Last year, Mr Lacina rejected a merger bid from the Raiffaisen group of
rural banking co-operatives as ill-founded, and refused an offer from an
investment banking syndicate to place the shares widely in international
equity markets.

FT  13 SEP 94 / International Company News: Flag still flies over Austrian
bank - CS did not expect such a strong nationalistic reaction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The leading trend in banking may be globalisation, but nationalistic
sentiment still counts for a lot, even in advanced industrialised countries.
That is probably the main message from the aborted attempt by CS Holding,
the international financial services group built around Credit Suisse, to
take over Creditanstalt, Austria's second largest bank.
The Swiss knew they were sticking their noses into a political quagmire when
they ventured into Austria, but did not expect such a strong nationalistic
reaction.
The tone was set in mid-May shortly after Mr Rainer Gut, CS chairman, had
made known that the Swiss group was interested in a large part of the
Austrian government's 70 per cent voting stake in the bank.
'We would be the only leading commercial bank in the developed world that
would be controlled from abroad,' moaned Mr Guido Schmidt-Chiari, chief
executive of Creditanstalt. In response, Mr Gut could only point to the
Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's control of Midland Bank of the UK.
In the subsequent three months, no one in Austria or anywhere else has made
any serious criticism of the commercial logic of CS taking over
Creditanstalt. Mr Gut said CS would have maintained the bank's Austrian
identity and it would have brought better access to global financial
markets.
However, even at the highest levels of Austria's business community, the
idea of Creditanstalt, the bank that financed the industrial development of
the Austro-Hungarian empire, being taken over by a foreigner, stuck in the
throat. When Mr Gut said CS wanted ultimately to control 100 per cent of
Creditanstalt, Mrs Maria Schaumayer, president of the Austrian National
Bank, declared solemnly: 'Creditanstalt must fly under the Austrian and not
the Swiss flag.' A week later, an unlikely combination of Austrian, German
and Italian banks and companies put together a counter-bid.
The Austrians do resent the Swiss, finding it difficult to accept that their
Alpine neighbours, so similar in many ways, are so much more successful in
international business. But Austrian bankers admit that a bid from a big UK
or German bank would have had the same reception.
Initially, this nationalistic response was camouflaged by the workings of
partisan politics in Austrian banking. Because the country has long been run
by a coalition of Conservatives and Social Democrats, the leading financial
institutions of each tendency share in government and government-influenced
business.
Creditanstalt is the flag bearer for Austria's Conservative party banks. But
if it were sold to CS, it would be out of the loop, and most of the
government's largesse could be directed to arch-rival Bank Austria, the
Socialists' bank. Therefore, the initial opposition to the CS bid came from
Conservatives.
Although it was aware of this possibility, CS argued privately that the
government could not consistently resist putting business Creditanstalt's
way if, under CS direction, it made increasingly competitive and attractive
offers. It was also widely thought that Mr Lacina, who was initially
enthusiastic in his support for the CS bid, shared this view. Indeed, he
probably saw it as a way to begin depoliticising the banking sector.
Nationalistic currents soon infected the Socialist party as well. In late
June, Mr Helmut Zilk, the mayor of Vienna, said: 'Any other solution would
be better than CS'.
Mr Lacina, who originally said he would make a decision before summer,
announced in July that he would appoint a consultant to review the bids.
It was widely understood that this meant nothing would be decided until
after national elections due in October. But supporters of the CS cause took
comfort from the thought that the Conservatives would likely lose a lot of
ground in the election, making it easier for the Social Democrats to sell
Creditanstalt to CS.
Then last month, Mr Kurt Heindl, the powerful trade spokesman for the Social
Democrats, said the government must maintain a golden share or some other
means of domestic control over Creditanstalt. More recently, Mr Viktor
Klima, the Socialist transport minister, said it was important to have
privatised banks controlled within Austria.
Mr Lacina, suddenly alone, began to backtrack, saying two weeks ago that an
Austrian influence in the bank had to be guaranteed. Then, a month later
than planned, he appointed a consultant to assess the bids.
CS said yesterday the appointment of JP Morgan did not have much to do with
its decision. 'We always knew someone would be appointed, and it pretty well
had to be a competitor,' CS said.
CS said the group had no regrets about making clear its desire ultimately to
buy 100 per cent of Creditanstalt. 'It was honest,' it said.

FT  13 SEP 94 / International Company News: Hermes rises 56% to FFr85.1m

<TEXT>
Hermes, one of France's leading luxury goods groups, yesterday announced a
56 per cent increase in interim net profits to FFr85.1m (Dollars 15.87m) in
the first six months of 1994 from FFr54.6m in the same period of last year.
The news of healthy first-half profits growth from Hermes, which last year
ended decades of family dominance by floating on the French secondary
market, continues the positive trend in the luxury goods sector. The
industry was hit by the economic recession of the early 1990s but has staged
a sharp resurgence since last autumn.
LVMH, another famous name in French luxury goods, last week reported strong
profits growth of 35 per cent to FFr1.26bn during the first half of this
year. The only negative note among the large luxury groups was struck on
Friday by Asprey, the London-based business specialising in super-rich
clients, which issued a profits warning because customers have spent less.
Hermes, which has a broader customer base at the upper end of the luxury
market, was relatively resilient to the recession.
Sales rose 24.3 per cent to FFr1.53bn during the interim period from
FFr1.23bn at the same time last year. Operating profits increased 47.8 per
cent to FFr220m from FFr148.8m. The group said it anticipated continued
growth in sales and profits for the full year.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hong Kong's Allied group, controlled by the controversial tycoon Mr Lee
Ming-tee, has increased its stake in Aitken Hume International to 60.9 per
cent, and launched a bid for the remainder at 55p a share. The offer values
the company at Pounds 29.6m.
Allied, which was the subject last year of a Hong Kong government
investigation into alleged corporate fraud, already owned 30.2 per cent of
Aitken Hume, but is purchasing a further 30.7 per cent from Said
International.
Aitken Hume is the banking group set up by Mr Jonathan Aitken MP, but the
company sold its operating businesses in the past 18 months and was left as
a cash shell. The offer values it at Pounds 29.6m, marginally above its
stated net asset value.
The Stock Exchange was due to remove the company's listing by October 29,
unless it could develop an operating finance business.
While the offer matches Aitken Hume's valuation as at March 31, a there is
potential hidden value for its buyer.
Aitken Hume is owed Pounds 7.5m from its sale of National Securities
Research Corp.

FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Jupiter Tyndall climbs 63% at interim stage
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jupiter Tyndall, the UK-based fund mangement group, reported a 63 per cent
rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 5.89m for the six months to June 30, up
from Pounds 3.61m.
Earnings per share rose from 8.2p to 13.2p.
Mr John Duffield, chairman, said the rise reflected fee income on new
accounts which did not come to Jupiter Tyndall until the second half of
1993. During the six month period, net new cash under management has
totalled a further Pounds 350m, largely from mandates to manage UK
specialist equity investments for US and UK pension funds.
With the acquisition of Queen Anne's Gate Asset Management, assets under
management totalled Pounds 4.15bn at the end of the period. The company had
earlier announced the sale of its banking assets, which, for the interim
period, earned profits of about Pounds 1.3m.
Jupiter Tyndall announced an increased interim cash dividend of 6p (4p).

FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: All-round growth behind Fairey's rise to
Pounds 12.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fairey Group, the industrial electronics and specialist engineering concern,
boosted first-half pre-tax profits by 26 per cent from Pounds 10.2m to
Pounds 12.9m, and is raising the interim dividend from 1.9p to 2.25p per
share.
Sales rose 15 per cent from Pounds 63.8m to Pounds 73.7m.
Mr John Poulter, chief executive, said excellent growth from the main
electronics sector - in spite of some weakness in the insulators business,
continuing enhanced margins at aerospace and defence, and improved volume in
filtration had combined to produce a 'very encouraging' result.
All three business sectors showed improved profits. The electronics and
electrical power business lifted operating profit from Pounds 7.18m to
Pounds 8.76m, as turnover rose from Pounds 39.2m to Pounds 47.8m.
Filtration and specialised ceramics increased operating profit from Pounds
1.58m to Pounds 1.8m on sales up slightly from Pounds 13.3m to Pounds 13.9m.
Aerospace and defence had profit of Pounds 2.03m (Pounds 1.33m) on sales of
Pounds 11.9m (Pounds 11.3m).
Overall, said Mr Poulter, there had been an improvement in demand for
Fairey's products in most geographic areas and all except one of its main
companies was ahead of last year.
The exception was the insulators business, which is facing reduced domestic
demand. Its factory at Stafford is being rationalised to reduce its cost
base in line with likely future requirements.
In spite of this, however, and some seasonality in Fairey's business which
favours the first half, Mr Poulter said 'we face the future with
considerable confidence'.
Net cash at July 2 was Pounds 19.1m, up from Pounds 10.2m at the end of
1993. The rise partly reflects Pounds 2.5m from a property disposal in
Tamworth.
Late last month, though, Fairey announced the Pounds 9.3m acquisition of
Massachusetts-based Imaging Technology, which makes specialised modular
computer boards for industrial image processing systems. This will be paid
for out of existing resources.
First-half earnings per share rose from 9.2p to 11.2p. Both these and the
dividends for last year have been restated to reflect the 1-for-1
capitalisation issue this June.

FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Perkins' Japanese venture to build compact
diesels in UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Perkins, the Peter-borough-based diesel engine producer, is to create a
joint venture with Japan's Ishikawajima-Shibaura Machinery (ISM) to develop
and build compact low-emission diesel engines in the UK.
The joint venture company, in which Perkins will be the majority
shareholder, will build up to 50,000 compact diesel engines a year by 2000.
Additional jobs will be created at Peterborough for a dedicated facility due
to begin production in early 1996. It will, said Perkins, combine the best
in European and Japanese technology.
Perkins has been distributing ISM's engines worldwide since 1987, but
believes that a joint venture will help it sharply increase its share of the
market for compact engines, where demand is rising.
Both companies believe a European manufacturing base will enable delivery
times to be reduced significantly. ISM hopes to keep the effect of the
production shift on its Matsumoto plant to a minimum by increasing other
business.
The 5-50 bhp engines from the venture will be the smallest ever produced by
Perkins. The deal will complement the strategic alliance announced earlier
this year by Perkins and Iseki, another Japanese company, to build a range
of 50-75 bhp engines at Peterborough, starting in 1995.

FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Singer &amp; Friedlander advances 12% to Pounds
13m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Singer &amp; Friedlander, the diversified merchant banking group, reported a 12
per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 11.7m to Pounds
13.1m, boosted by significant growth in its investment banking operations.
The performance was distorted by share sales during 1993, and profits before
exceptional items for the six months to June rose by 22 per cent to Pounds
11.1m, up from Pounds 9.13m.
Growing competition in the corporate lending market restricted growth in its
core banking business, and loans to customers increased only marginally,
from Pounds 274.3m to Pounds 282m. Bad debt provisions fell from Pounds
825,000 to Pounds 33,000.
Profits from merchant banking and investment management rose to Pounds 6.92m
(Pounds 5.77m). Corporate finance activity increased, and advisory deals for
Embassy Property, Enviromed, and more recently Wellman, should ensure an
increased contribution for 1994. Funds under management, primarily for
private clients, rose to more than Pounds 1bn.
Collins Stewart, the 51 per cent owned broker, saw a sharp decline in market
making profits, and Singer's dealing profits fell from Pounds 2.19m to
Pounds 415,000. It was also hit by the impact of falling bond markets on its
debt trading portfolio.
Singer's property portfolio, now valued at about Pounds 85m, contributed
Pounds 2.49m (Pounds 1.89m), helped by trading profits. Interest and
investment income rose to Pounds 1.7m (Pounds 1.47m), reflecting increased
cash from recent share sales.
Singer made Pounds 3.9m of provisions against property values last year, and
it wrote back Pounds 2m of this at the interim stage, almost off-setting a
Pounds 2.57m profit from the sale of its Burford stake in 1993.
During the half year Singer increased its stake in Associated Nursing
Services to 22.6 per cent, and it now owns 60 per cent of Edgar Hamilton,
the Lloyd's broker.
It also has a 21 per cent stake in the highly profitable People's Phone, an
independent provider of mobile phone services. Brokers estimate it could
make about Pounds 20m profit from the sale of this stake.
Mr John Hodson, chief executive, said Singer was looking to make further
investments in teams and businesses within its core area of financial
services.
It has recently set up unit trust fund management and structured finance
teams, and is thought to be negotiating the purchase of Carnegie
International, the European securities business.
House broker Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities forecasts full-year profits
of Pounds 26m.
The interim dividend is lifted to 1.4p (1.25p). Earnings per share rose from
4.63p to 5.16p.

FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Measure for market measure - Peter Martin
considers the gap between analysts' and FT-SE figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why, stock market analysts have been asking, have their calculations of the
overall valuation of the market diverged so much from the official
price/earnings ratio for the FT-SE Actuaries All-Share index published every
day in the Financial Times?
Some small difference is normal. But since the beginning of 1993, the gap
has widened sharply.
In August, for example, the FT-SE figure had the All-Share selling at a
ratio of 19.9. The average broker calculated the figure at 16.2.
There is more than just statistical amour-propre at stake. The overall p/e
ratio is used for assessing whether British equities are fairly priced in
relation to those overseas, and whether any individual share is expensive or
cheap relative to the market as a whole.
The FT-SE version of the other important market indicator, gross dividend
yield for the All-Share, has also been showing a marked gap with analysts'
calculations.
In August, the official FT-SE figure showed that equities, overall, were
yielding 3.74 per cent. Analysts put the figure at 4.07 per cent.
Over the summer, a working party of the FT-SE Actuaries UK indices
committee, under the chairmanship of Mr Peter Jones of M&amp;G, has been looking
at the issue.
The burden of the work fell on Mr Paul Walton and his colleagues in the
research department of James Capel, supplied with data by the FT's
statisticians.
After studying the earnings and dividend figures of the companies in the
FT-SE Actuaries 350 index, Mr Walton's conclusion was that three main
factors explained almost all the gap:
Timing. FT Statistics calculates the index's earnings figure by adding
together each company's two most recent half-years. As soon as a company's
interim results are issued, the earnings included in the index figures
become those for the latest six months and the second half of the previous
financial year. At a company's year end, the figures are its full-year
earnings. Brokers, by contrast, use their analysts' estimates of each
company's earnings for the current calendar year.
The FT-SE Actuaries numbers are objective, in the sense that they are based
on official company data, but they will inevitably always lag behind
brokers' estimates. Normally, this generates only a slight difference
between the two series, but when earnings are swinging sharply - as when a
company moves from loss to profit or from recession to growth - a gap opens.
The recent recession produced a sharp swing in companies' results. In
particular, a number of big losses from large companies last year are still
in the All-Share earnings figure, but have now dropped out of the brokers'.
Mr Walton's study says that the timing effect is responsible for 1.8
percentage points of the 3 point gap between Capel's p/e estimate and the
official All-Share figure. (Capel's p/e estimate is roughly in line with
that of other brokers.)
Unrelieved ACT. The problem of how to treat Advance Corporation Tax arises
in acute form for those companies that fail to generate enough UK earnings
to offset the ACT they must pay on their dividends. The FT and the brokers
adopt different approaches to tackling this problem. However, it is unlikely
to be a significant factor in distorting either side's figures; at most it
may be responsible for half a percentage point of the three point gap.
Interpretation. The likelihood that individual companies' results will be
treated differently by different compilers has been heightened by the new
FRS 3 accounting standard, because more judgment is needed to estimate a
company's underlying earnings figure.
FT Statistics, which calculates the index earnings figures, adheres to the
definition of headline earnings proposed by the Institute of Investment
Management and Research, but this does not always provide unambiguous
answers. So differences of opinion will persist.
They tend to cancel each other out, however, and contribute only another
half a percentage point to the three point gap.
Overall, therefore, only 0.2 percentage points of the gap are left
unexplained by Mr Walton's study, a negligible amount. The gap itself can be
expected to close over the next few months, as the 'bad' earnings figures
drop out of the official series.
There are two lessons from this. The sharpness of the swing in earnings
during this recession is perhaps partly a reflection of the growing
enthusiasm among companies for managing their earnings, a trend which FRS 3
has slowed rather than reversed. There is a great temptation for finance
directors, faced with a bad year or half-year, to throw as much bad news in
as possible, starting next year with a clean sheet. This exaggerates the
timing differences inherent in the two approaches to calculating market
earnings.
In addition a market p/e ratio or yield is not a single, monolithic figure
suitable for all purposes. The official versions calculated for the indices,
which appear each day in the FT, are 'objective' numbers, intended to
provide the best yardstick of historical performance. Individual brokers,
with different objectives, will produce figures which inevitably differ.
Such differences are to be welcomed as a sign of diversity of approach, not
feared as a weakness of the credibility of the market statistics.
An exposure draft explaining in detail the methods used to calculate the
earnings and dividend figures for the FT-SE Actuaries series of indices will
shortly be available. Copies may be obtained, when published, from the
Indices Unit, London Stock Exchange, London EC2N 1HP and from FT Statistics,

FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: UB pays Pounds 21m for Dutch snacks
business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
United Biscuits said yesterday it will become the savoury snack market
leader in Benelux countries with its purchase of Dalgety's Dutch snacks
business for Pounds 21m.
The purchase will give UB about 33 per cent of the market and push Snack
Ventures Europe, a joint venture between PepsiCo and General Mills of the
US, down to a close number two.
Dalgety said it was selling the business because it was the only savoury
snacks company it had in continental Europe. It would focus on the UK where
it had strong brands including Golden Wonder crisps.
In continental Europe, Dalgety will concentrate on food ingredients and pet
foods.
In the Netherlands, Dalgety has about 14 per cent of the extruded snacks
market and nine per cent of crisps through its NIBB-IT brand and private
label products.
The business, which reported profits of Pounds 1.5m on turnover of Pounds
25.8m in the year ended June, will expand UB's Benelux snack sales by about
25 per cent.
'We've been relatively weak in the Netherlands and Belgium in savoury snack
but not crisps,' said Mr John Warren, UB's finance director. Currently, UB
is supplying the Netherlands from a plant in Belgium which is operating near
capacity.
The Dutch operation, which exports about 45 per cent of its output, will
also give UB another route into Germany, the main European market in which
it is under-represented. UB has one plant in southern Germany but most of
its output goes to Italy.

Biotrace International, the maker of microbiological testing systems which
came to the market last November, announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 225,000
for the seven and a half months to end-June after an exceptional Pounds

For the year to July 31 1993 there were pre-tax losses of Pounds 113,000.
Turnover amounted to Pounds 1.95m and losses per share came through at 0.7p.
Mr Brian Levett, chief executive, said the company continued to trade ahead

FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: UK Safety tops Pounds 1m at midway
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UK Safety, the specialist footwear manufacturer, reported pre-tax profits of
Pounds 1.02m on turnover of Pounds 15.3m for the six months to July 2.
The outcome compared with a profit of Pounds 302,000 on turnover of Pounds
5.02m for the 1992 first half. Last year's interim figures however consist
of only two months' trading of the group in its present form.
The company came to the market in May last year through the reverse takeover
of TSW, the former independent television contractor for the south-west of
England.
Mr Colin Dunmore, chairman, said the outcome had been achieved against a
background of uneven demand and a competitive marketplace.
The figures had also been depressed by higher net interest costs of Pounds
464,000, against positive income of Pounds 81,000 received on the large TSW
cash balances last time, Mr Dunmore said.
In addition, the first phase of the group's restructuring plans had led to
an exceptional cost of Pounds 215,000, although this had been more than
offset by a Pounds 730,000 profit on the disposal of its investment in Socit
Europenne des Satellites, he added.
Earnings per share emerged at 1.78p (1.96p) and the interim dividend is
being maintained at 1.04p.

FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Retailing losses take toll on Liberty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Liberty fell by 33p to 355p yesterday, as the retailing and
textile group tumbled into the red in the six months to July 30, following
sharply increased losses on the retailing side.
Pre-tax losses emerged at Pounds 305,000, against profits of Pounds 602,000
previously, as trading losses in the retailing division grew to Pounds 1.36m
(Pounds 561,000).
Mr Patrick Austen, chief executive, described the performance as
'dis-appointing', though he stressed that poor first halves were not
uncommon - Liberty's year is heavily weighted to the second half.
Having steered the group through full enfranchisement of its non-voting
shares since his arrival in May 1993, he has rejigged the divisional and
management structure - creating separate textile and brand products
divisions - and had 'bitten the bullet' and closed the store in New York's
5th Avenue.
This had been the flagship of a five-store US chain, but the other stores
were all closed by January 1992.
The US closure had staunched regular first-half losses of about Pounds
200,000, said Mr Austen, but had cost Pounds 606,000. This was included in
retailing's trading losses.
However other factors contributed to the decline. The group said that the
first day of the sale had coincided with a rail strike and that the
'extremely hot weather' had kept shoppers away.
There had also been several primary 'disruptions', when the London flagship
store - and Regent Street itself - was closed after a firebomb and other
bomb alerts.
Mr Austen said Liberty was trading 7 per cent up year-on-year until June,
but that in July it was 5 per cent down. However since the period-end the
group was back to a 5 per cent increase over last time.
Group turnover rose 2 per cent to Pounds 38.3m. The interim dividend is held
at 1.85p in spite of losses of 3.44p (earnings 0.25p) per share.

FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Dowding &amp; Mills achieves 33% growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dowding &amp; Mills, the electrical and mechanical services group, lifted
pre-tax profits by 33 per cent to Pounds 6.73m in the year to June 30 the
back of a 9 per cent rise in turnover.
Profits of Pounds 5.04m last time included exceptional costs of Pounds
628,000. Sales increased from Pounds 83.3m to Pounds 91m.
Mr Jim Cole, chief executive, said that excluding exceptionals, operating
profits were up 12.6 per cent at Pounds 7.2m, helped by a good performance
in the US.
Conditions in continental Europe continued to be difficult, although Germany
had performed well.
In the UK, which accounts for 60 per cent of turnover, the volume of
business throughout 1993-94 had levelled out after three years of decline.
The group had also been able to impose price rises in line with inflation.
'Since the end of July we have seen some improvement in the UK,' said Mr
Cole.
Mr Peter Hollings, the chairman, said in Australia recovery was well under
way but it would take time for the new Melbourne facility to contribute to
profits.
During the year the company shed 35 people at a cost of Pounds 148,000,
against 97 redundancies at a cost of Pounds 423,000.
Net interest payable fell from Pounds 732,000 to Pounds 479,000, and gearing
was reduced from 18.8 per cent to 15.3 per cent.
Earnings per share rose to 2.74p (2.04p). A final dividend of 1.62p (1.58p)
is proposed, taking the total to 2.56p (2.5p).
The group also announced the acquisition of The Surface Flatness Co, a
Manchester mechanical calibration business, for Pounds 370,000.

FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Dewhirst doubles to Pounds 7m and raises
pay-out by 63%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dewhirst Group, the supplier of clothing to Marks and Spencer, the high
street retailer, increased its interim pay-out to shareholders by 63 per
cent yesterday as it announced profits had doubled to Pounds 7m.
Mr Scott Beattie, finance director, said the profits growth was mainly the
result of higher volumes and better productivity. This had helped to
increase trading margins from 3.8 per cent to 6 per cent.
'Last year was a year of getting sales growth and this was a year of making
use of it,' he said. Sales for the 26 weeks to July 15 rose by 23 per cent
from Pounds 95.4m to Pounds 117m.
As a result of the substantially improved performance, the dividend was
increased from 0.4p to 0.65p. Earnings were almost doubled to 3.63p.
Both the ladies' wear and men's wear divisions had performed strongly during
the first half, said Mr Tim Dewhirst, chairman. Reorganisation of the
children's wear operation, which incurred losses last year, was now also
largely complete. This business was expected to break even in 1994.
Mr Dewhirst said prices were not expected to rise this year. There remained
some uncertainty, however, given the pressure of hardening cotton prices.
Mr Dewhirst said he was confident the company would continue to make
progress in 1994. In the past 12 months, Dewhirst had increased its market
share both on the high street and in Marks and Spencer, which accounts for
about 85 per cent of its sales.
'Our efforts are focused at improving operating margins,' he said. Dewhirst
has said it aims to get trading margins up to 7 per cent by 1996.
Higher profits and improved cashflow helped Dewhirst to reduce its net
interest payments from Pounds 156,000 to Pounds 121,000.

FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Pendragon helped by revived demand for new
upmarket cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A revival in demand for new upmarket cars lay behind a 32 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.06m at Pendragon, the executive and luxury car
dealer, in the six months to June.
Mr Trevor Finn, chief executive, explained that with used car values rising
towards the levels for new cars, people were more likely to buy new. New car
sales contributed Pounds 6.2m of gross profits, against Pounds 4.6m last
time.
He suggested that 'principals of industry' were giving signals that the
recession was now over and that they were making car purchases they had
previously postponed.
This, Mr Finn said, helped to explain why the group's total new
registrations grew by 20 per cent over last time, against a 14 per cent rise
in the whole car market.
Group turnover climbed 56 per cent from Pounds 119.6m to Pounds 186.9m,
including Pounds 2.46m from acquisitions. Growth in operating profits was
less dramatic at 39 per cent, from Pounds 3.57m to Pounds 4.94m, including
Pounds 68,000 from acquisitions.
Mr Ian Wheeler, finance director, said the margin slippage was due to the
addition of Ford, Peugeot and additional Rover franchises, which added
Pounds 25m turnover to last time's Pounds 5.5m in the group's EC volume car
sector. This greater turnover at smaller margin, he said, had a dilutive
effect across the group.
Gross profits from used car sales were flat at Pounds 2.2m, while after
sales business contributed Pounds 12.4 (Pounds 9.4m). Mr Finn said that
luxury cars owners were more likely to return to the seller than turn to
Kwik-Fit or the like. Contract hire chipped in Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 900,000),
illustrating the rise in values in the used car market.
Interest payable rose to Pounds 888,000 (Pounds 495,000) on borrowings up at
Pounds 13.4m (Pounds 8.2m at end-December).
The interim dividend is lifted to 2.7p (2.4p), payable from earnings up 20
per cent to 7.3p (6.1p) per share.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Midland Assets, which was created in May to acquire four nursing homes from
Northern Leisure, said yesterday that it was in talks that might lead to 'a
substantial acquisition.'
It is understood that the talks could end in a reverse takeover. An
announcement is expected by the end of next week.
Midland Assets is chaired by Mr Nicholas Oppenheim, also vice-chairman of
Northern Leisure. It paid Pounds 1.9m in cash for the RealCare nursing homes
business, which Northern had been trying to sell for two years.
The company, which raised Pounds 2.4m via an intermediaries offer of
ordinary shares, said at the time that it was looking for opportunities that
either had above average possibilit-ies for medium term growth, or were
likely to generate steady but increasing income.
Yesterday the shares closed at 21.5p, up 1p.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
British Polythene Industries, Europe's largest polythene film producer,
announced an average 15 per cent increase in industrial and retail product
prices yesterday in the wake of raw material price rises.
Mr Cameron McLatchie, chairman and chief executive, said the company was
raising sales prices to customers following a 25 per cent increase in
polymer prices to over Pounds 500 per tonne in August.
British Polythene increased pre-tax profits by 30 per cent from Pounds 6.61m
to Pounds 8.61m in the half-year to 30 June. Turnover rose by 20 per cent
from Pounds 96.6m to Pounds 116m with a Pounds 3m contribution from
acquisitions. Operating profits were ahead at Pounds 10.2m (Pounds 7.77m)
helped by Pounds 99,000 from acquisitions.
Fully diluted earnings per share rose from 12.29p to 14.82p. The share price
closed up 7p at 488p yesterday.
The raw material price increases reflected general upward pressure on prices
in the world plastics market and further increases are likely in the near
future, including a 10 per cent rise in October.
'In the short term these raw material cost increases present our customers
and ourselves with pricing problems,' he said.
However, in the absence of monthly rises in polythene prices, Mr McLatchie
anticipated that margins would begin to improve again once prices had
settled down.
In the medium term the raw material prices would not have a detrimental
effect on the business, particularly as prices were heading 'for the level
where our recycling will start to show good returns'. The company was able
to offer more competitive prices for its recycled material as virgin plastic
prices rose.
The directors said British Polythene continued its acquisitive strategy,
buying a further seven businesses this year with total pre-acquisition
turnover of Pounds 25m.
Gearing rose from 18 per cent last time to 28 per cent with net borrowings
of Pounds 23m.
Acquisitions included Nelson Packaging, a specialist carrier bag business,
the remaining UK polythene assets of Nyborg Plast and Megafilm.
An interim dividend of 4.5p (3.75p) was declared.
COMMENT
British Polythene demonstrated it is a credible business yesterday when its
shares closed up 7p despite its price increases and warnings of more. It is
a credit to the business that the market also believes price rises should
not be regarded as a major problem per se. If rises in raw material costs
can be passed on efficiently, the possibility remains that margins might
even improve. Acquisitions have blurred the company's results but a clearer
picture is beginning to emerge and organic growth of 4 to 5 per cent was
achieved this time. Forecasts put profits between Pounds 17m and Pounds
18.5m next year and Pounds 19m and Pounds 21m in 1995. The shares are
trading on a prospective p/e of 15 and look a safe bet for the the
medium-term investor.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Merivale Moore, the commercial property investment company, ended the year
to June 30 firmly in the black with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.11m.
The outcome, which compared with a loss of Pounds 939,000 last time, was

Merivale suffered losses in both 1992 and 1993 years, but returned to profit
in the first half of 1994.
After a tax charge of Pounds 289,000 (Pounds 2.71m refund) earnings per
share came out at 6p (12.9p) and the company is returning to the dividend
list with a proposed 2p pay-out for the year.
Since the year end Merivale has acquired a Pounds 6m portfolio of retail
properties from Warner Estate Holdings, part of the consideration for which
was the issue to Warner of 3.5m Merivale shares  - 20.5 per cent of the
enlarged equity.
In addition, 16 commercial properties were acquired from Sun Life for Pounds
12.4m cash.

<TEXT>
Despite an improved second half, FII Group, maker and distributor of
footwear and scientific and medical equipment, reported a fall in pre-tax
profits from Pounds 5.2m to Pounds 2.55m in the year ended May 31.
The result was after exceptional items of Pounds 1.32m (Pounds 550,000)
relating to product recall costs, losses on cancellation of a development
contract and rationalisation costs.
Turnover edged ahead to Pounds 83m (Pounds 82m) which Mr Monty Sumray, the
chairman, said was despite setbacks in the scientific and technical division
where sales fell to Pounds 8.45m (Pounds 11.3m). Rationalisation and
investment programmes were continuing in the division which reported losses
of Pounds 1.47m (Pounds 89,000).
In footwear, sales rose to a record Pounds 74.6m (Pounds 70.6m) although
operating profits slipped to Pounds 3.49m (Pounds 4.93m).
Earnings per share fell from 22.7p to 10.9p but the dividend is maintained
at 14.75p with an unchanged final of 8.75p.

FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Centre Re buys Sedgwick arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Centre Re, the Bermuda-based reinsurer, yesterday further strengthened its
connections with the Lloyd's of London insurance market when its CentreLine
subsidiary acquired Mendip, a Bermudan subsidiary of Sedgwick, the insurance
broker.
Like CentreLine, Mendip is an underwriter of 'time and distance' policies, a
form of specialist financial reinsurance used by Lloyd's syndicates to
manage their reserves more effectively.
CentreLine will pay up to Pounds 30m for Mendip, which will increase its
total time and distance assets under management to some Dollars 2bn (Pounds
1.2bn). The consideration is payable in cash on completion - which will take
place not later than September 30 - except for a deferred sum of Pounds
8.6m, payable in nine annual instalments to December 31 2002, with the
amounts varying between Pounds 600,000 and Pounds 1.3m.
Mendip's profits for 1993 were Pounds 1.7m and its net assets at that date
amounted to Pounds 18.2m. Its total assets and liabilities at last December
31 were Pounds 337.7m and Pounds 319.5m respectively. Sedgwick said the
proceeds would be used to reduce group borrowings but group profits would
not be materially affected.
Centre Re, now wholly owned by Zurich of Switzerland, has a number of other
connections with Lloyd's. It provides reinsurance for Integer, a stop loss
reinsurance scheme for individual Lloyd's Names. The company is also
involved as a reinsurer in a corporate capital scheme designed by Insurance
Indemnity Services which aims to provide some Pounds 80m in capacity for up
to 86 syndicates.

FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Boxes coming to market this month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boxes, a cardboard packaging producer, is planning to come to market through
a placing which is likely to value the company at more than Pounds 18m.
The family-owned company is expecting to raise up to Pounds 5m in new money
through the flotation at the end of this month, in order to fund
acquisitions. Boxes is estimated to have about 200 competitors in the
cardboard packaging market.
The Watford-based manufacturer specialises in the production of printed
folding cartons for the pharmaceutical, food and household markets.
Mr Yalkin Tanyar, chief executive of Boxes, said: 'We believe that a listing
on the London Stock Exchange will give Boxes greater flexibility to take
advantage of opportunities to develop the group, both organically and
through the selective acquisition of complementary businesses.
'The company also expects to benefit from a higher profile and greater
acceptance by customers as a result of being a listed company.'
Boxes, which also owns manufacturing operations in Great Harwood, near
Manchester, and Burnley, Lancashire, increased its turnover from Pounds
15.7m to Pounds 17.2m between 1992 and 1994.
Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 0.7m to Pounds 1.3m in the same
period, as the company increased its operating margin from 8.7 per cent to
12.8 per cent.
The company, which also owns businesses making cake decorations and small
rigid boxes, has a blue chip customer base including Smith &amp; Nephew, Reckitt
&amp; Colman and SmithKline Beecham.
The flotation will leave the bulk of the company in the hands of the family
of Mr Derek Gee, president of Boxes which currently owns 95 per cent of the
capital. The remainder is held by Mr Tanyar's family.
The issue is sponsored by Samuel Montagu and the stockbroker is James Capel.

Shares in Independent Parts Group (IPG) were yesterday priced at 112p in a
placing with institutional investors for a flotation capitalising the
vehicle components company at Pounds 20m.
Peel Hunt, the company's stockbroker, will place 7.15m shares, representing
about 44 per cent of the equity, raising Pounds 7.6m net of expenses.
IPG is the holding company for Tuberex, a manufacturer of automotive exhaust
systems, and Veco, a wholesale distributor of replacement vehicle
components. Turnover to end-March 1994 for the combined group was Pounds
13.5m, with pre-tax profits of just over Pounds 2m.
The placing receipts will be used to repay borrowings, which will leave the

FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Country Casuals shares fall on warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Country Casuals shares plunged by more than a fifth yesterday as the
clothing retailer warned profits would be hit by unexpected difficulties in
establishing its larger women's brand, Elvi.
The shares fell by 32p to 120p following the announcement. Analysts, who had
been expecting some costs as a result of the expansion of Elvi, marked their
forecasts for annual profits down from about Pounds 3m to Pounds 2m.
Mr John Shannon, chairman, said establishing Elvi as a retail chain had
taken longer than expected. The group had encountered difficulties in
opening shops and sales had been below budget.
Country Casuals was forced to discount higher levels of Elvi stock in the
summer sales as a result and gross margins were hit. Mr Shannon said the
group remained committed to developing a middle market niche in the larger
women's market. In the second half, Country Casuals would be supporting its
50 shops with national advertising.
Country Casuals also suffered delays in opening shops in its smaller Koto
business, which caters for the younger fashion market. Although sales were
10 per cent higher in the first half, margins were affected by discounting.
These factors meant that full year profits would be substantially below
market expectations, Mr Shannon said. He refused to quantify the extent of
the expected writedowns and provisions. More details would be given with the
interim results due in October, he said.
The Elvi management team has been strengthened with the appointment of Mr
Russ Hamer, formerly of Debenhams and Laura Ashley, as managing director.
The core Country Casuals chain improved margins by about two percentage
points. The division achieved sales of Pounds 15.1m in the first half, down
by 1 per cent.
Lerose Manufacturing enjoyed a strong first half, with sales up by 26 per
cent.

FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Steady growth for Forth Ports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forth Ports, the privatised Scotland-based ports operator, saw steady growth
in turnover and profits in the six months to June 26. Pre-tax profits rose
4.2 per cent to Pounds 5.73m (Pounds 5.49m). Turnover was up 2.5 per cent at
Pounds 16.2m, against Pounds 15.8m adjusted to exclude Pounds 1.3m relating
to offices being constructed at Victoria Quay, Leith, Edinburgh for the
Scottish Office, which have been sold forward.
None of the profit made on a property sale at Victoria Quay has been
incorporated. Part will be included in the full year results with the
balance next year.
The overall tonnage handled in the Forth estuary increased by 75 per cent to
20.1m as a result of a 90 per cent increase in piped cargo through BP's
Hound Point terminal. Dry cargo handled dropped by 250,000 tonnes to 1.3m
tonnes. Revenue per tonne of piped cargo is only about a twentieth of that
for dry cargo.
Mr William Thomson, chairman, said Forth Ports was encouraged by the recent
transformation of the area around the port of Leith which augured well for
future developments. Port business had been steady since the half year and
the company should report a satisfactory profit for the full year.
Earnings per share rose 6.7 per cent to 12.7p (11.9p) and the interim
dividend is up 20 per cent at 2.7p (2.25p).
The shares rose 20p to 475p yesterday. BZW, the company's broker, raised its
profits forecast for the full year from Pounds 12.3m to Pounds 13m,
including a Pounds 1.65m contribution from Victoria Quay. The forecast
implies earnings per share of 29p and a prospective multiple of about 16.

FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Output doubles but Pict Petrol drops to
Pounds 3.25m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Production from the Scott field helped Pict Petroleum, the oil and gas
exploration company, more than double its production from 2,413 barrels of
oil equivalent per day to 4,960 at the year-end and achieve record output of
1.8m barrels of oil equivalent against 881,000.
Net profits in the year to June 30 fell from Pounds 4.82m to Pounds 3.25m
after a tax charge of Pounds 71,000 (nil). Pre-tax profits dropped from
Pounds 4.82m to Pounds 3.32m. There was a foreign exchange loss of Pounds
329,000 this time, compared with a gain of Pounds 1.57m last time.
Turnover rose from Pounds 9.58m to Pounds 18m despite lower oil prices,
which averaged Pounds 9.87 per barrel compared with Pounds 11.10.
Earnings per share came out at 6.3p (9.34p).

FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Nestor-BNA in the red after disposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sale of its hospitals and nursing home division earlier this year pushed
Nestor-BNA, the healthcare and personnel group, into the red for the 24
weeks to June 17.
The pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.5m was struck after exceptional charges of
Pounds 4.2m, reflecting a loss of Pounds 4.5m on the sale of the division
offset by a gain of Pounds 290,000. The loss compares with profits of Pounds
2.01m.
Turnover rose from Pounds 49.3m to Pounds 56m, including Pounds 5.62m
(Pounds 5.01m) from discontinued operations.
Mr Mike Rogers, chief executive, said there had been strong growth in the UK
nursing agency business, which is the biggest in the country and accounts
for about half of turnover. Operating profits rose from Pounds 862,000 to
Pounds 1.2m.
However, the nursing agency business in the US had suffered in extremely
difficult markets and operating profits fell to Pounds 356,000 (Pounds
744,000).
The disposal reduced fixed assets from Pounds 18.4m at the end of last year
to Pounds 2.9m, and shareholders' funds from Pounds 5.66m to Pounds 2.42m.
Borrowings dropped from Pounds 18.3m to Pounds 5.54m, cutting gearing from
324 per cent to 229 per cent.
Losses per share were 4.11p (1.93p earnings). The interim dividend is
unchanged at 1.15p.
COMMENT
Getting out of hospitals looks like a good move, enabling the company to
concentrate on the growth area of flexible health care. The debt situation
is also clearer, with interest cover much improved. Stripping out the
exceptionals, earnings per share of about 4p can be expected for the full
year, so the dividend looks safe despite the disastrous foray into the US.
At the moment the yield of 8 per cent - almost double the market average -
is the only reason for any interest in the stock. The question is, how long
will the US albatross delay a dividend increase?

FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: EIS maintains growth with Pounds 8.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EIS Group, the acquisitive specialist engineering group, continued its
23-year run of uninterrupted profit growth with a 14 per cent increase in
pre - tax figures to Pounds 8.93m at the interim stage.
However, the company warned that margins remained under pressure, although
the situation was showing some signs of picking up. 'We've seen a glimmer of
improvement in recent weeks,' said Mr Peter Haslehurst, chief executive.
'We're feeling more optimistic than we have done in quite a while.'
Turnover to the end of June rose 25 per cent to Pounds 154.27m (Pounds
123.86m), including Pounds 2.78m from acquisitions. Earnings per share rose
from 13.1p to 13.3p, while the interim dividend was increased 3 per cent to
3.4p.
Mr Haslehurst said that there were strong performances from the technical
mouldings and flight spares businesses, although he declined to give a
breakdown of operations. Conversely, the aircraft and presision engineering
divisions were weak in the face of difficult market conditions. Process
equipment was 'patchy but improving.'
He added that the first half acquistions had all traded well. EIS bought C&amp;F
Miller, an aircraft maintenance equipment group, in April for Pounds
500,000, followed a month later by postal and defence equipment manufacturer
ABPH for Pounds 2.5m. ADE-HML Ltd, an aircraft equipment maker, followed in
July for Pounds 3.8m, with German coiling machinery group Henrich for Pounds
300,000 the next month.
With gearing down to 4 per cent, Mr Haslehurst said that further
acquisitions were a possibility. 'But we also have spare capacity available
to take up any significant upturn in demand.'

FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Bardon in the black with Pounds 2.1m at
midway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bardon Group, the international aggregates and ready mix concrete company,
yesterday announced details of a large new loan facility and management
reorganisation as it published its first profits for 2 1/2 years.
The company, which had net borrowings of Pounds 239m at the end of June,
representing gearing of 69 per cent, said that it had agreed a Dollars 350m
(Pounds 226m) four-year syndicated banking facility, stabilising its
finances. Most of Bardon's borrowings are in the US.
The company made pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.1m on turnover of Pounds 140m
in the first six months of this year, compared with a loss of Pounds 59.5m
from turnover of Pounds 160.5m in the first half of 1993, when it wrote down
by Pounds 60m the value of its UK sand and gravel dredging business.
Operating profits rose by 10 per cent in the first half to Pounds 10.1m,
thanks to a strong performance from its UK businesses which had increased
profits by a third to Pounds 8.4m.
Profits at the US arm, however, fell from Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 900,000 due
to bad winter weather which had restricted construction activity, and a
delay in approving finance for the Massachusetts road programme.
Bardon said that it had removed the divisional management structure of its
UK and US businesses to shorten reporting lines, improve efficiency and
reduce costs. These businesses would in future report direct to Mr Peter
Tom, the chief executive.
It had been agreed that Mr Stuart Lamb, previously US divisional chief
executive, would leave the group shortly.
The improvement in the group's finances meant that the pressure to sell
businesses to reduce borrowings had been removed, said Mr Tom. An attempt to
sell the UK aggregates dredging business - it is thought to Minorco - fell
through last year.
The UK businesses, including the dredging operations, were now benefiting
from increased sales volume and higher prices as UK construction activity
had risen. Prices also had risen in the US, but coated roadstone volumes in
Massachusetts were significantly lower.
Losses per share emerged at 0.1p (16.2p) and the interim dividend is held at
0.8p.
COMMENT
Massachusetts has tripped the group again, marring an otherwise good trading
performance. Bardon's finances may be stabilised, but it is difficult to see
how borrowings can be reduced to a manageable level from trading alone. A
sale may yet be needed, but this can be at a time and price more of Bardon's
choosing. A prospective yield of approaching 6 per cent on a maintained
final dividend and a net asset value of about 65p should underpin the share
price, which fell 2p to 43p yesterday. However, pre-tax profits of Pounds
20m this year and Pounds 28m next, putting Bardon on prospective multiples
of 21 and approaching 15, indicates that this rating is unlikely to improve
while borrowings remain high.

FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: British Biotech shares up 5% despite deeper
losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Biotech shares defied a falling pharmaceuticals sector yesterday and
jumped 5 per cent to 490p in spite of the company's announcement of deeper
losses in the first quarter.
The market ignored the 34 per cent rise in net losses to Pounds 5.6m and
chose to focus instead on British Biotech's upbeat comments on the progress
of its cancer and pancreatitis drug trials.
Dr Brian Richards, chairman, said the year had started well for the group.
'The successful completion of the Pounds 46m rights issue. . . together with
the encouraging results of our trials means we are now planning the final
stages of development for our leading drugs,' he said.
The comments were interpreted by the market as 'further confirmation that
things are on track,' said one analyst. The losses were also an improvement
on the performance in the final quarter of last year, when British Biotech
reported a deficit of Pounds 8m.
Turnover fell by 64 per cent to Pounds 767,000 due to the sale last year of
British Biotechnology Products. Sales of continuing operations rose by 64
per cent.
The company has set up a new subsidiary, Neures, to investigate
neuro-degenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis.
The loss per share deepened from 10.7p to 11.9p. There was no dividend.

FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Pressure points at the margins - The
ability to pass on price rises is limited
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Complaints about rising costs putting pressure on margins and warnings about
price increases to come have punctuated the current British company results
season.
Yesterday there was yet more evidence of inflationary pressure in the
system.
Dalgety, the food manufacturer, complained of very competitive margins and a
sharp rise in input prices for its consumer food businesses. British
Polythene said it expected raw material prices to rise 60 per cent in the
three months to October.
Last week BTR, the industrial conglomerate, saw its share price decline
nearly 12 per cent after warning that margins would remain under pressure,
largely because it was unable to pass price increases on to customers.
The impact of inflation has varied from sector to sector. In printing, paper
and packaging, for example, increases in raw material prices have been
largely passed on.
Mr Alain Soulas, chief executive of Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the
Franco-British paper company, which last week reported a 67 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits, said pulp prices had risen five times this year, resulting
in an increase of 45 per cent.
'The recovery in the world economy has turned the pulp market from a buyers'
one to a sellers' one,' he said, adding that the company's success in
passing on price rises was in part due to its strong position in the market.
Bowater, the packaging and printing group, has also been successful in
passing on price rises. Mr Michael Hartnall, finance director said: 'We
don't like doing it, but we have no choice. We have seen a substantial
upswing in our raw material costs since the start of the year.'
He expected inflationary pressure to peak by the year-end then level out. Mr
Soulas said the strong pressures could run on longer than that.
The competitive environment has prevented companies further down the
distribution chain, like food retailers, from pushing through price rises.
But the powerful market position of the top five food retailers, which
control almost half the UK grocery market, has enabled them to resist
suppliers price rises.
'Our prices will not increase,' said Mr Archie Norman, chief executive of
Asda, the UK's third largest supermarket group. 'This is both company policy
and a necessity. The marketplace just will not bear it.'
Mr Derek Pretty, finance director at Kwik Save, the discount supermarket
operator, added: 'We do detect more desire from suppliers for price
increases, but we are not able, or willing, to accept them.'
For food manufacturers, like Dalgety, the result has been constant pressure
on margins.
Another industry in a similar predicament is housebuilding. Reporting
results last week, both Wilson (Connolly) and Bellwinch complained of the
sharp rise in raw materials costs set against the dull housing market.
Mr Ian Black, managing director of Wilson (Connolly), said yesterday bricks
and bricklayer costs had risen 18 per cent during the first half of the
year, while concrete block prices had increased 20 per cent and timber
prices 15 per cent.
'House price inflation will be 3 per cent by the year end if we are lucky,'
he said. 'We are being squeezed from underneath in a market which cannot
bear any price increase.' He blamed the recession for reducing building
material manufacturing capacity and for forcing labourers abroad.

FT  13 SEP 94 / KKR to buy Borden food group for Dollars 2bn: Wall Street
takeover specialist uses RJR Nabisco shares in deal which may lead to
industrial links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the Wall Street buy-out firm best known for its
Dollars 26bn purchase of RJR Nabisco in 1989, is returning to the takeover
trail with the Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) acquisition of the struggling US
food group Borden.
The deal, which will involve Borden shareholders taking RJR stock in
exchange for their shares, may also involve a degree of industrial merger
between RJR and Borden.
Borden's loss of independence had been widely expected. Damaged by a series
of ill-judged acquisitions in the late 1980s, the company tried
unsuccessfully to sell itself off last year, with KKR and Hanson, the
Anglo-US conglomerate, among the rumoured candidates. In the absence of a
buyer, the share price then slumped from almost Dollars 20 to last Friday's
close of Dollars 11 5/8 . KKR's offer values the shares at Dollars 14 1/4 .
Founded in 1857, Borden grew to be the largest dairy company in the US and
the world's biggest maker of pasta. It reached crisis at the end of last
year with the sacking of its chairman, Mr Anthony D'Amato, and the halving
of its dividend.
The new management, headed by chairman Mr Frank Tasco, then proposed a
disposal programme, including the sale of North America's second biggest
snacks business. The plan was criticised by some analysts as inadequate and
remains largely incomplete.
The KKR deal, which is typically complex in its structure, involves the
disposal by KKR of half its remaining 35 per cent stake in RJR to pay for
the acquisition of Borden. At the same time, RJR is to issue Dollars 500m of
new shares to take a 20 per cent stake in Borden. RJR will also have the
option to buy a further 10 per cent of Borden, and will have representation
on the Borden board. KKR said the present Borden management team would
remain in place.
Analysts said there was considerable scope for merger between RJR and
Borden, particularly in the snacks market. RJR declined to comment
yesterday. However, the deal specifies that if RJR should buy any of
Borden's businesses in the future, it may use in payment the Borden stock it
stands to acquire through yesterday's transaction.
For KKR, the immediate problem is what to do with the loss-making parts of
Borden's business, including the dairy division, which makes up a quarter of
group sales. An adviser to KKR said no decisions would be made until a
definitive agreement was signed in two weeks' time. 'They've barely begun
thinking about it,' she said.
Analysts commented that the move partly represented a switch by KKR out of
RJR, where earnings have improved sharply in recent years, to a more highly
geared recovery play. Borden has made heavy losses in the past two years,
chiefly because of restructuring charges.
Mr Les Pugh of Salomon Brothers said 'it's a very, very smart deal. It's not
an industrial merger, but a wonderful piece of financial engineering.'

FT  13 SEP 94 / Soggy crisp prices and surfeit of pigs hold Dalgety to
Pounds 120m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lower UK crisp prices and an over-abundance of continental pigs limited
Dalgety, the food and agribusiness group, to a 7 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 120.1m for the year to June 30.
Without these setbacks, operating profits from continuing operations would
have risen about 10 per cent, Mr Richard Clothier, chief executive, said.
They fell 4 per cent to Pounds 124.9m, although acquisitions contributed a
further Pounds 9.6m to leave the group modestly ahead.
With both markets expected to show tentative signs of recovery this year,
however, Dalgety raised its final dividend from 12.65p to 13.15p a share.
Dalgety said it would seek more acquisitions in continental Europe, where it
was focusing on food ingredients and pet foods, while concentrating its
consumer foods efforts on the UK where it has strong brands such as Golden
Wonder Crisps.
In line with that strategy, it said yesterday it was selling the Dutch
savoury snack business to United Biscuits for Pounds 21m.
The UK crisp market enjoyed volume growth over the past year but wholesale
prices have fallen by at least 5 per cent, analysts estimate. Supermarkets
have exploited excess capacity, persuading manufacturers to produce
own-label snacks at low prices. Despite the pressures, Golden Wonder
products increased their market share to 18 per cent. Further cost cuts was
the key to improving profitability, Mr Clothier said.
Operating profits from foods fell 13 per cent to Pounds 57.4m despite good
performances from sauces and Spillers pet foods. The latter was boosted by
the acquisition of Paragon from British Petroleum.
Agribusiness operating profits rose 8 per cent to Pounds 34.8m. An animal
feed acquisition and a 24 per cent increase in US sales by Dalgety's Pig
Improvement Company offset low prices for its pigs in Europe. Food
ingredients lifted operating profits by 49 per cent to Pounds 57.4m thanks
to improved flour milling and acquisitions.
Food distribution in the US reported a 15 per cent rise in operating profits
to Pounds 16.4m, benefiting from higher sales to McDonald's and other
customers.
Group turnover rose 11 per cent from Pounds 4.47bn to Pounds 4.96bn. Pre-tax
profit of Pounds 120. lm was struck after a Pounds 2.8m charge for the
settlement of insurance claims. The 1992-93 figure of Pounds 112.2m included
a Pounds 9m provision for the same reason. Including the charges, earnings
per share were 36.7p against 35.7p. Acquisitions totalling Pounds 85m pushed
up net debt to Pounds 127m from Pounds 49m and gearing from 12 to 33 per
cent.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Bayer to pay Dollars 1bn to reclaim its name: German group
buys slice of over-the-counter drugs market in US from SmithKline Beecham
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Bayer is to pay Dollars 1bn (Pounds 649m) to buy back the right to use its
own brandname in the North American market more than 75 years after the US
government seized the German chemicals group's local assets during the first
world war.
The deal was announced yesterday, just two weeks after the Bayer
name-and-cross emblem changed hands in the sale of Sterling Health, Eastman
Kodak's over-the-counter drugs unit, to the Anglo-American group SmithKline
Beecham for Dollars 2.93bn.
The sale includes OTC products such as Bayer aspirin, Midol analgesics and
the Milk of Magnesia indigestion treatment. These will fill out Bayer's
existing US range built around Alka-Seltzer and One-A-Day and Flintstones
vitamins.
Mr Manfred Schneider, Bayer's chairman, said the group's US and Canadian
activities would switch to the Bayer name as soon as possible.
The purchase met two of his prime objectives: regaining the brand rights and
extending Bayer's reach in the world's largest OTC medicine market. 'This is
a memorable day in our corporate history,' he added.
The sale brings SmithKline Beecham down from the world's biggest OTC drugs
company, a position held for the past two weeks, to number three.
The sale proceeds will help cut SmithKline Beecham's debt to less than
Pounds 2.5bn. The company recently reported plans to cut debt through
disposal of 'non-strategic acquisitions'. 'This is a non-strategic asset in
that we already had the critical mass in the US,' it said.
Additions from Sterling, which last year earned Eastman Kodak Dollars 43m on
sales of Dollars 366m, will almost double Bayer's over-the-counter turnover
in the US.
The branded aspirin business alone is estimated to generate Dollars 150m
sales a year in the US, and was recently valued by analysts at about Dollars
500m. In the late 1890s, Bayer produced the first high quality
acetylsalicylic acid and registered aspirin as a trademark in Germany and
the US.
Bayer had focused its US interests in its Miles unit, which last year had
sales of Dollars 6.5bn.
Bayer originally made an offer for the whole of Sterling, but was outbid by
SmithKline in an auction.
After the sale, Bayer said it would seek 'clarification' from Sterling's new
owners of its intentions towards the trademark rights and parts of the
operating business.
Bayer extended its reach in the US market earlier this year when it paid
Dollars 310m for a minority stake in Schein Pharmaceutical, a
privately-owned generic drug specialist. Generics are one of the fastest
growing segments in pharmaceutical markets.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Forte expected to beat Accor for Meridien hotels chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Forte, the UK hotels and restaurants group, is favoured to win its
long-running battle with Accor of France to gain control of Meridien, the
luxury hotels chain owned by Air France. The state-owned airline is expected
to make an announcement on Wednesday.
Hotel industry observers in London, however, were cautioning yesterday
against excessive optimism on Forte's behalf. They note that Accor used its
political influence in France to postpone a Forte victory before.
Accor lobbyists are believed to have stepped up their activities over the
past few days, arguing for the chain to remain in French hands. 'We know
they're going like fury,' one UK industry observer said yesterday.
Air France declined to comment on the sale of a controlling stake in
Meridien ahead of Wednesday's board meeting. But officials confirmed that a
decision had been taken based on the size of the relative offers. Forte's
offer values the hotel chain chain at FFr1.9bn while Accor's offer is
thought to value the company at FFr1.7bn.
Both offers represent an increase of FFr100m since the bids were first
tabled in April. A decision on the bids was delayed, after Accor lobbied the
centre-right government of French prime minister Mr Edouard Balladur.
Finance for Accor's offer is being provided by Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talaal
of Saudi Arabia. It is understood that the eventual winner's bid would be
reduced if Meridien lost a significant number of hotel management contracts
as a result of a change of ownership.
Air France, which is seeking to reduce its debt burden is expected to sell
the majority of its 57 per cent stake in the hotels chain. The European
Commission has ordered the completion of the sale by the end of this year as
a condition for a French state capital injection of FFr20bn for the
lossmaking airline.
Meridien's management has expressed its preference for the bid from Forte.
But some unions at the hotel chain are opposed to the sale and are planning
a demonstration at Air France today in protest at the move.
The Meridien group, which comprises 58 hotels, fell into loss last year. The
company blamed the losses, which totalled FFr29.7m, on difficult market
conditions, particularly in its French operations.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Board forces Shepard to check out of Savoy: Ramon Pajares of
Four Seasons approached to become hotel group's managing director and
Fergusson likely to succeed Tuke as chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Giles Shepard yesterday resigned as managing director of the Savoy Hotel
group, saying he had been asked to go because he did not agree with
proposals for the future management of the company. His resignation was
widely expected, after rows last week with Sir Anthony Tuke, the Savoy
chairman, and Sir Michael Richardson, a Savoy director.
The board meets today to discuss a replacement. Mr Ramon Pajares, general
manager of London's Four Seasons hotel, has been approached to take the job.
Mr Shepard said yesterday: 'Over the past few months, discussions have taken
place between our major shareholders regarding the future of the company,
its management and its organisation. I have not found myself able to concur
with what is proposed. Accordingly, I have been asked to resign.
'Because of my love for the Savoy company and my immense admiration for the
staff, who have supported me so loyally during my 15 years as managing
director, and to avoid further damaging speculation in the press, I have
decided to follow this course of action.'
Mr Shepard has been under pressure for some time, largely because of the
poor financial performance of the group, which last year halved its
dividend.
His position became unsustainable last week when he issued a statement on
behalf of the Savoy board criticising a non-executive director for leaking a
document to the press. The statement, which was not authorised by the board,
was seen as a criticism of Sir Michael, who denied leaking the document. Sir
Michael was supported by Sir Anthony.
The Savoy board is expected to announce today that Sir Anthony, who wishes
to retire, is to be succeeded by Sir Ewen Fergusson, chairman of Coutts, the
private bank, and a Savoy director since July last year.
Directors caution, however, that Sir Ewen's appointment cannot be taken for
granted; previous widely-tipped candidates for the chairmanship have not won
board approval. If he is approved, his appointment is unlikely to be
temporary. Reports that Sir Ewen will be succeeded by a chairmanship
rotating between Savoy loyalists and representatives of the Forte group have
been dismissed by board members.
The board meeting is expected to give Forte, which has 68 per cent of
Savoy's shares but only 42 per cent of the vote, some form of participation
in management. However, plans to merge Forte luxury hotels with the Savoy's
properties - which include the Savoy, Claridge's and the Connaught - are
believed to have been dropped.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Quebec separatists sweep to victory in provincial elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The separatist Parti Quebecois swept to victory in provincial elections in
Quebec yesterday, setting the stage for a divisive referendum on the future
of Canada's only French-speaking province.
However, with a number of returns still to be declared, it appeared the PQ's
victory might not reach the landslide proportions suggested by recent
opinion polls. An hour after the polls closed last night, the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation said that PQ candidates were elected or leading in
80 of the 125 seats in the National Assembly.
The outgoing Liberals, who want Quebec to remain part of Canada and who had
won a clear majority in the 1989 election, were elected or leading in 45
constituencies. Opinion polls had projected PQ wins in 80 to 90 seats, with
no more than 40 seats for the Liberals.
Besides the Liberals' unexpectedly large number of seats, federalist forces
were encouraged by the early results, which suggested that the PQ would win
less than 50 per cent of the popular vote.
The PQ, led by former economics professor Mr Jacques Parizeau, has promised
to hold an independence referendum some time in 1995. But opinion polls have
consistently shown that a clear majority of Quebeckers is opposed to an
outright split from Canada. Political observers have concluded that many
voters turned to the PQ mainly to reflect their desire for a change in
government.
The PQ's last term in office, between 1976 and 1985, was marked by a
humiliating defeat in a 1980 referendum for a loose form of sovereignty. PQ
leaders have indicated that they plan to wage a much more vigorous
pro-independence campaign in the next referendum than they did 14 years ago.
One advantage they will have is the presence of a large group of separatist
MPs, belonging to the Bloc Quebecois, in the federal House of Commons in
Ottawa.
Mr Jean Chretien, Canada's prime minister and an avid federalist, was due to
make a statement on the election result late last night. In addition, the
premiers of the other nine provinces, who will play a crucial role in
shaping public opinion ahead of the referendum, are due to discuss their
strategy in a telephone conference call this morning.

FT  13 SEP 94 / UVF admits bombing Dublin railway station: Britain fears
loyalist violence could threaten ceasefire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN,  and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELFAST,, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of an early end to Irish political violence receded yesterday
as the outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force admitted bombing a Dublin railway
station.
The bombing was condemned as 'revolting' by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern
Ireland secretary, reflecting British concern that loyalist violence could
threaten the open-ended IRA ceasefire announced last month.
Mr Pat Doherty, a senior official of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing,
accused the UVF of trying to force the Dublin government to abandon direct
contacts with republicans. 'The loyalist hope is that fear of the conflict
being brought 'down here' will scupper the peace process,' he said.
Mr John Hume, leader of the moderate nationalist Social Democratic and
Labour party, said he was confident the IRA would not retaliate because Sinn
Fein's leadership was 'totally committed' to the peace process.
Mrs Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, the Irish justice minister, said the attack would
not deflect the Dublin government from its strategy of consolidating the
republican ceasefire by talking directly to Sinn Fein.
British officials believe the US is likely to grant a visa to Mr Gerry
Adams, Sinn Fein president, at the Irish government's request, as part of
the Irish strategy of drawing Sinn Fein into mainstream politics.
However, Downing Street believes President Clinton and administration
officials will avoid a direct meeting with Mr Adams for fear of weakening
unionist support for the peace process.
The Dublin bomb exploded as an express train from Belfast was pulling into
Connolly station in the city centre. Two women were slightly hurt. Irish
police said the explosion was caused by a detonator which failed to ignite a
2kg explosive charge, suggesting that casualties could have been higher.
The UVF, which bombed a Dublin pub three months ago, said it had planted
bombs in seven other locations in the city. None was found.
The bombing reflects loyalist suspicion of a deal between Britain and the
IRA, and confirms that Protestant terrorists are prepared to take their
campaign to the Irish Republic.
The Combined Loyalist Military Command, representing the UVF and the Ulster
Freedom Fighters said last week a loyalist ceasefire would depend on
assurances that no deal had been done. Loyalists are also concerned about
the implications of a 'framework' document for Northern Ireland's future
being drawn up by the British and Irish governments as part of the peace
process.

FT  13 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: SmithKline/Bayer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SmithKline Beecham's sale of Sterling's north American consumer healthcare
business to Bayer looks a smart move. SB never needed Sterling's operations
to strengthen its US over-the-counter businesses. The driving logic was to
fill geographical gaps elsewhere. Yesterday's deal rids the company of
embarrassing product overlap and reduces debt which had become sufficiently
burdensome to worry some investors. The only possible fly in the ointment
remains an as yet unquantified tax charge.
Whether Bayer has pulled off a masterstroke is more doubtful. On a romantic
level, for the first time in nearly 80 years, the German company enjoys the
right to use its own name and the Bayer Cross trademark in the US.
Strategically, the group justifies the purchase by arguing it now has strong
brand names in the three largest US OTC categories. By 1995, the group
expects hopes to have critical mass, with projected annual OTC sales in
north America of more than Dollars 700m.
Bayer can afford the acquisition, and has been helped by the strength of the
D-Mark against the dollar. But the question remains whether the deal is good
value. The speed with which it was concluded, and the poor negotiating
tactic of announcing interest within hours of SB's Sterling acquisition,
will not have reduced the price. At 23 times last year's earnings, the
business does not look cheap. Bayer will have to work hard at building
margins to avoid the criticism that a German chemicals company has yet again
overpaid for assets.

FT  13 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Dalgety
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dalgety is a minnow in a sea of food manufacturing whales, facing the
constant danger that profitable niche markets will prove vulnerable to
assault from larger competitors. It was this phenomenon - in the form of
intensifying competition in the UK crisps market - which helped drive
margins in the group's food division down from 11.2 to 8.8 per cent last
year. Recognising the difficulties, Dalgety yesterday signalled a subtle but
significant refinement of its strategy.
It is pinning its hopes on the Europe-wide pet foods and food ingredients
markets, two segments of the food manufacturing industry where Dalgety
reckons it can more than hold its own against giants such as Mars and
Unilever. The group will continue to defend its share of the crisps and
snacks market in the UK, but will withdraw from continental Europe - hence
the sale of its Dutch business in this sector to United Biscuits.
Whether this is a complete answer to the strategic issue is unclear. Pot
noodles and savoury snacks alone will not secure good returns for Golden
Wonder in the UK over the longer term. Ultimately it might make sense to
dispose of Golden Wonder so as to finance more rapid expansion in pet foods
and snacks. There are benefits in the pipeline from the restructuring
undertaken by the new management, but, until Dalgety takes final shape, the
main attraction will be its 5.5 per cent yield.

FT  13 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: KKR/Borden
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
KKR's Dollars 2bn bid for Borden looks like a triumph of financial
engineering. The leveraged buy-out group is not only acquiring a
pasta-to-wallpaper conglomerate which is ripe for a break-up. By paying with
shares in RJR Nabisco, KKR has also halved its exposure to the tobacco and
food manufacturer. RJR has not been the fabulous investment KKR initially
anticipated when it bought it for Dollars 26bn in 1989, mainly because of
the cigarette price wars launched on Marlboro Friday. KKR presumably thinks
the bulk of the gains from restructuring RJR have already been achieved - a
point other shareholders should note.
Meanwhile, the share swap between Borden and RJR is designed to facilitate
the transfer of some Borden assets to Nabisco. RJR would pay with its
Dollars 500m worth of Borden shares. Borden could then sell its RJR stake
and use the cash to pay off some of its debt mountain.
The deal, though, has industrial as well as financial logic. Borden, in
common with most food manufacturers, has seen its brands devalued as
retailers and consumers have driven harder bargains. The industry is now
aiming to regain some of its lost bargaining power by reshuffling assets and
concentrating on fewer product areas. United Biscuits' purchase yesterday of
Dalgety's Dutch snack business is another example of the trend. Though
Borden has few powerful brand names, its assets should prove more valuable
in other companies' hands.

The turn in interest rates in the UK has been received rather differently
from that in the US. When the Federal Reserve moved in February, bond and
equity markets tumbled. Yesterday UK equities dipped only slightly, while
gilts jumped by nearly a point at the long end. Of course, the markets have
had plenty of time to position themselves for a rise in base rates. But the
reaction suggests that the UK authorities may have managed a pre-emptive
strike which will enhance their anti-inflation credibility in the short
term. That does not mean, though, that they have also secured a soft
landing.
Recent data on housing, the retail trade and the motor industry suggest the
consumer side of the recovery may have already tapered off. But the economy
is still growing at close to 4 per cent, so the output gap is closing. That
alone might warrant some monetary action, even without yesterday's evidence
of rising wholesale prices. The markets would be deluding themselves,
however, if they thought that one half-point rate rise would be sufficient
to halt this trend. If they wish to appear consistent, the authorities must
tighten policy until the growth rate slows.
The implication for equities is not encouraging. Earnings are unlikely to
keep up this year's cracking pace in 1995, especially after a further
increase in taxes. Gilts ought, by contrast, to have room to advance. But
they remain at the mercy of sentiment in the international bond market. The
Bank of England has yet to announce an auction for September. It must hope
that the positive mood will last long enough to get a conventional sale
away. Now that base rates are rising, it could not sell any more floating
rate debt without serious loss of face.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Video on demand set for take-off
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A California company is planning to intensify competition for the world
in-flight entertainment market by taking video-on-demand above 30,000 ft for
the first time.
Micropolis Corporation, which specialises in video-on-demand technology, has
signed a deal which should lead to the introduction of the film of your
choice, when you want it, on Pacific flights from next year.
Showing films on long haul flights is routine but the Micropolis system
means that around 20 feature films will be instantly available to
passengers.
They will be able to choose a film when they are ready and can pause or play
back the screening as desired.
The system is sophisticated enough to serve all the first and club class
passengers simultaneously - typically around 96 people - even if everyone
choses the same film. A similar service will be available to economy class
passengers for a fee.
Mr Stu Mabon, chief executive of Micropolis, which has UK offices at
Reading, Berks, said yesterday he would announce the deal at the World
Aviation Entertainment Association's annual convention in Montreal next
month. He declined to say whom the deal was with but it is believed to be
with Matsushita, the Japanese consumer electronics group which has an
in-flight equipment division. The first airline to use the system is
expected to be Singapore Airlines.
The system, an airline version of the AV Server 100, will be demonstrated at
the IBC broadcasting convention in Amsterdam this month, Mr Mabon said.
Micropolis says the system has already gone live in seven hotels in the US
including the Omni Richardson and Grand Kempinski in Dallas, Texas in
partnership with SpectraVision, the hotel entertainment company.
Mr Mabon said it appeared that offering guests a wide choice of films when
they wanted them had nearly doubled film revenues in the hotels which have
the system.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Europe's top banks warned over costs of switch to Emu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Large European retail banks would have to spend up to Ecu225m (Pounds 177m)
each to adapt technology and operations for a single European currency,
according to unpublished research carried out for the Ecu Banking
Association.
The association's 90 members include most large banks in Europe. In a report
published yesterday, it warned that banks in countries that do not take part
in the European Monetary Union will face extra costs and competitive
burdens.
However, its own research estimates that large banks in Emu countries may
have to spend Ecu100m-Ecu150m each to adapt, and costs could be 50 per cent
higher if countries keep domestic currencies in parallel for a transitional
period.
A working paper says 'such raw figures could of course provoke an
unnecessarily alarmist reaction throughout the EU' if published. Association
leaders said yesterday they wanted to emphasise Emu's opportunities.
Mr Walter Damm, chairman of the EBA committee studying Emu, said it had
'wanted to avoid the impression that Emu is such a costly exercise that it
is not worth the candle'. Emu is due to start by 1999 under the Maastricht
treaty.
Mr Damm said banks in countries such as the UK and Denmark, which have
opt-out clauses from monetary union, could face disadvantages because they
would lack an Ecu funding base and would have to operate in parallel
currencies.
The published report warns banks to prepare for the costs of transition to
Emu, but says these could be 'marginal' if they are absorbed as part of
continuous development of information technology.
Banks' loss of revenue from foreign currency exchange, and related financial
derivatives, after monetary union could be balanced by a bigger market in
Ecu exchange with currencies such as the US dollar, it says. However, it
adds every European bank will have to redefine its geographical spread after
Emu.

How do you cure an 80-year-old headache? Open your wallet, take out Dollars
1bn, and buy a chunk of aspirin. That's what Bayer has just splashed out to
acquire Sterling Winthrop, thereby regaining its old Bayer Aspirin brand.
Bayer developed aspirin at the turn of the century. But during the first
world war the US Alien Property Custodian took control of Bayer's US
property and in December 1918 sold those assets to Sterling Drug for Dollars
5.31m. The German company has been smarting ever since; it lost not only its
brands, but also the use of its name in the US.
Mind you, the Kaiser always preferred paracetamol . . .

Times change - even at the Royal School of Needlework in Hampton Court.
The impeccably connected Giles Shepard, skilled embroiderer of some 30
years' standing, was recently replaced as chairman of the finance committee
of the Royal School by John Burke, chief executive of Bristol &amp; West
Building Society. The well-cushioned Burke, whose dexterity with a needle
doesn't quite stretch to fixing buttons on shirts, says that a friend on the
council had been keen to tap a wider pool of business knowhow.
Now that Shepard, who remains a council member, has checked out as managing
director of The Savoy, he will perhaps have more time once again to devote
to the school's most urgent task - raising funds to educate its apprentices.
But perhaps one of the other luminaries on the council might volunteer to
return with the begging bowl to Rocco Forte, who has apparently been known
to donate in the past.

with the six numbers correctly crossed and a forged letter from the lottery
organisation confirming he had won (a positively modest) DM2m. The bank
extended a DM30,000 loan. By the time it sniffed a swindle and caught the
man he had spent DM29,000 on trips to Paris, London and Leipzig.

What a relief to find even Goldman Sachs' Gavyn Davies, one of the
Treasury's wise men, makes the occasional boo boo. His column in yesterday's
Independent newspaper carried the immortal words 'Short of Eddie George
making an announcement by loudhailer from the middle of Threadneedle Street,
no
more conspicuous statement
of unchanged policy
could have been made.'
So what went wrong? Davies puts it down to equipment failure. He likens the
Bank of England's signalling to the money markets to the way that the Sea
Lords used to send messages to the fleet by a system of pulleys and wires
and semaphore flags. Davies's verdict is that 'a seagull sat on the line'.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Observer: Vladimir's welfare
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Some former communists are such excellent exponents of free market economics
that you wonder what on earth was going on inside their heads just a few
years back.
Take former Communist party member Vladimir Dlouhy, for instance, currently
the Czech Republic's most popular politician. In the five years since
Prague's velvet revolution, Dlouhy has become leader of the
liberal-conservative ODA party and also been taken on as minister for
industry and trade.
Dlouhy was in London yesterday, trying to drum up interest in investment
from the Confederation of British Industry. He drew a convincing picture of
an economy which has metamorphosed from Comecon dodo into lean, mean machine
of new-found liberalism. He also did a slash and burn job on west Europe's
welfare state practices, accusing them of being the root cause of damaging
anti-dumping measures taken against former communist states.
Dlouhy told the CBI that blaming low wages in Asia and eastern Europe for
western Europe's relatively poor economic performance was wide of the mark.
The true cause of European Union sluggishness is bloated social security
payments, pushing labour costs in Germany to levels as much as 15 times
higher than in the Czech Republic. So cut the welfare state nonsense and
introduce proper competition, to the benefit of all.
Where on earth did Dlouhy dream up such radical notions? Maybe he was
thinking of those countries where the state is so bankrupt as to be unable
to meet its pensions, healthcare and social security commitments  - such as
former communist regimes.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Mr Clarke buckles up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
And the sound that you heard was the sound of precedents breaking. The UK
chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, yesterday decided to raise interest rates,
before such a move was thought overdue, and only a month before the
Conservative party conference. What is more, the leader of the opposition
did not criticise the increase. Although a conclusive verdict will not be
possible for some time (if ever), the policy shift looks about right. The
breaks with tradition can be welcomed even less reservedly.
Over two years into economic recovery, the direction of yesterday's
half-point change - which took UK base rates to 5.75 per cent - was no
surprise. The shock was the timing, and to a lesser extent, the size of the
increase. On both, Mr Clarke has taken a smallish economic risk, and a
larger political one.
The economic gamble in yesterday's rise is that the recovery is strong
enough to take it. Pointing to last week's mixed batch of data, critics
might argue that this is far from certain. UK consumers may yet react more
negatively to this year's tax rises than many suppose. Moreover, a rise in
interest rates could, on this argument, snuff out any chance of a sustained
upturn in investment, which has sadly lagged behind in this recovery to
date.
It is in the nature of a 'pre-emptive' rate rise that these doubts will be
raised. But the recent experience of US monetary tightening indicates that
the authorities cannot afford to look reluctant to raise rates as the
economic cycle matures. The UK yield curve is unusually steep for this stage
in a recovery, while price pressures, though thankfully slight, are visible
nonetheless.
The yield curve offers a reward for plucky chancellors, in the form of lower
long-term rates. Judging by yesterday's market reaction, the decision to
tighten could deliver just such an effect. The gap between UK and German
government long-term bond rates - a good guide to differing inflation
expectations for each country - narrowed a little to close at about 1.35
percentage points.
As the continued size of that gap indicates, it will take more than a single
pre-conference pre-emption for Mr Clarke to convince many that the UK's
historic penchant for 'boom-bust' economics is gone for good. These fears
would revive, for example, if Tory backbenchers were successful in winning
tax cuts in the November Budget 'in return' for having swallowed yesterday's
rate increase.
It is crucial that the rationale for yesterday's increase be understood to
be a long-term one: delivering the government's own inflation target of 1-2
1/2 per cent before the end of the current parliament. Yesterday's move
seemed refreshingly novel: the good news is that with luck Mr Clarke will
not have to steel himself to do the same again for some time to come.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Personal View: How to flatten the cycle's ups and downs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY BLAIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We are barely out of the last recession and already the economic brakes are
being applied. Businesses and households across Britain have good reason to
feel worried.
But these concerns will go beyond the extra burden yesterday's rate rise
will place on family and investment budgets on top of this year's tax
increases. More fundamental still is what the increase reveals about the
long-term weaknesses of the British economy. It is here that the real
political debate will be joined, not over whether each rise is in itself
justified.
The fact is that the government has failed to create the conditions
necessary for sustained growth without accelerating inflation. These
conditions are a strong and dynamic economic base, with the industrial
capacity and skilled workforce necessary to cope with rising demand. Without
them, slow growth, rising insecurity at work, high unemployment and
increased social decay will persist.
Of course, it is a matter of acute economic judgment whether yesterday's
increase was necessary now in order to choke off inflationary pressures or
could have been postponed until later. Recent economic statistics tell
conflicting stories - weaknesses in the housing market but rising retail
sales; stable retail price inflation but accelerating producer prices.
What is clear, however, is that the Treasury and Bank of England, on the
basis of published statistics and privileged information available to them,
believe that rising inflationary pressures justify action now to slow the
recovery.
But why is inflation threatening to derail economic growth at such an early
stage of the recovery? When Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal
Reserve, raised US interest rates at the beginning of this year, the US
economy had been growing for three years and output had risen by 10 per
cent.
UK rates, already higher than in the US, Japan and Germany, have been forced
up only two years from the bottom of the recession with output up just 5 per
cent.
Part of the problem is credibility. It must be worrying for the government
that it has made so little progress over the past two years in persuading
the public and the financial markets that it can keep inflation under
control.
The implied City forecast in the index-linked bond market is an inflation
rate of more than 5 per cent by the end of the decade, a long way from the
government's pledge of 2.5 per cent by the end of the current parliament.
But the reason for this lack of credibility goes to the heart of Labour's
critique of the Conservatives' economic mismanagement over the past 15
years. For the reason why neither the financial markets nor the Bank of
England believe that the government will meet its inflation objectives is
not simply that it has failed before, but that it continues to treat
inflation as the disease, not the symptom, of a deeper economic malaise in
the British economy.
In short, the government's lack of credibility is not simply a question of
competence but of analysis and understanding. For the root cause of
Britain's economic failures is that our economic base is too small and
backward to deliver the employment opportunities and sustained,
non-inflationary growth we need - too few successful firms, not enough
skilled workers, too little research into the development and use of new
technologies.
Tackling inflation is not simply about prudent monetary policy, important
though that is. Instead, economic policymakers in Britain need to tackle
what CBI director-general Howard Davies recently identified as 'crucial
structural weakness' in the British economy - the deficiencies which mean we
have high unemployment alongside rising skill shortages, and a recovery
starved of new investment.
What Britain needs is a modern industrial policy to build up our economic
base - to encourage more long-term investment in industry, support small
businesses and encourage the use of private finance in public infrastructure
projects. It needs a tax system which encourages investment rather than tax
evasion and promotes employment rather than unfairness. And it needs to
boost the education and skills of British workers.
Only then will the UK economy be able to deliver rising living standards and
employment growth without running into an inflationary mire. No government
can avoid completely the ups and downs of the business cycle. Our aim must
be to minimise them and provide the conditions for stability and growth
which will make stop-go economics a thing of the past and remove the spectre
which now haunts this recovery.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Prevention rather than painful cure: The UK interest rate
rise shows the government sees political gain in controlling inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The scene was probably unique in Britain's post-war history.
Yesterday morning a supremely confident - some might say ebullient -
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke called the press into the Treasury to hear him
explain an increase in UK interest rates.
Under past Tory chancellors, such moves were usually made in response to
financial market crises and associated with policy failure. Mr Clarke was
unabashed in presenting it as a sensible step towards securing the economic
recovery and expanding employment.
Although some increase in UK borrowing costs had been widely expected for
some time, the significance of Mr Clarke's move should not be
underestimated. Yesterday's rise of half a percentage point in bank base
rates to 5.75 per cent is the first increase in officially inspired lending
rates for nearly five years.
As the last Tory chancellor to begin raising rates after a period of falling
borrowing costs - Mr Nigel (now Lord) Lawson) - was forced to keep
ratcheting rates upwards to 15 per cent, it would be unnatural if Mr
Clarke's decision did not stir troubling folk memories in the Conservative
party and the nation at large.
But the reason that Mr Clarke appeared so cheery as he fielded questions
yesterday was that he hopes and believes his move will spare him the agonies
suffered by Mr Lawson between May 1988 and October 1989 when base rates
soared from 7.5 per cent to 15 per cent. The smiles on the faces of Treasury
officials - and across town among senior Bank of England staff - show that
his advisers think he could be right.
To an important extent Mr Clarke has grabbed the policy initiative and
further defined his chancellorship. We knew that he always said he was
opposed to inflation. We knew that he was prepared to be tough on fiscal
policy, not hesitating to push up taxes last November. Yesterday, he
reinforced his reputation for fiscal prudence by explicitly ruling out tax
cuts in his forthcoming Budget on November 29.
But there were doubts about whether this self-styled son of the industrial
Midlands understood the need for timely and hard decisions on monetary
policy, not least because of his insistence last February on a base rate cut
when Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, and most of his
officials in the Treasury were opposed.
Yesterday, Mr Clarke showed he will take potentially unpopular action based
on a medium-term view of the economy when current indicators of inflation
are subdued. Underlying inflation, as measured by the retail prices index
excluding mortgage interest payments, was just 2.2 per cent in July. This
was its lowest level for 27 years - and in the lower half of the 1-4 per
cent target band, where the government is committed to having inflation by
the end of this parliament.
The strategy is not without risks. Mr Clarke admitted that the decision to
raise rates - taken finally at lunch time last Friday - was 'finely judged'.
When Mr Clarke and Mr George held the first of their monthly monetary
meetings after the summer break last Wednesday they agreed that the economy
was 'poised' for an interest rate increase, but still had some doubts over
whether to act straight away or after their next meeting at the end of this
month. The final decision came after a two-day pause for reflection.
While the two men agreed that inflation is currently very low, they noted
that some indicators - such as commodity prices, manufacturers' input prices
and CBI surveys of corporate pricing intentions - suggested that cost and
price pressures had begun to pick up. Monetary indicators were mixed,
although continued strong growth of M0, the narrow measure of notes and
coins in circulation, continued to be a worry.
Principal among the factors persuading the two to raise rates was evidence
of stronger than expected growth in the first half, when gross domestic
product rose at a year-on-year rate of 3.7 per cent. This was well above the
the 2.75 per cent growth rate forecast for this year by the Treasury in June
and the UK's estimated 'trend' growth of about 2.25 per cent at which the
economy can expand without stimulating inflationary pressures.
The decision was also influenced by last month's latest CBI survey of
industry pointing to a further acceleration of output and above average
capacity utilisation, as well as growing evidence of faster growth in
continental Europe and signs of recovery in Japan.
Core data about the economy published in August and relating to the first
half of this year appears to have weighed more with the chancellor and
governor than more recent indicators suggesting that consumer demand might
at last be slowing in response to tax increases that took effect in April.
The subdued state of the housing market, where estate agents have complained
of weak turnover and mortgage lenders have been scaling down their forecasts
of price rises this year, did not stand in the way of the rate rise. The
Bank's view in any case is that the housing market is 'steady' and not weak.
The decision shows how closely attuned Mr Clarke and Mr George now are. Mr
George did not have to mount a long campaign to persuade Mr Clarke to act.
True, in the summer the governor was the first to warn that rates would have
to rise. But it is understood that last Wednesday's meeting was the first at
which Mr George specifically recommended a rise in rates. By Friday at the
latest, the chancellor was on the same wave-length.
Yesterday Mr Clarke was sounding for all the world like the author of the
Bank of England's quarterly inflation reports, underlining the need to act
in a timely manner to influence inflation in 18 months to two years' time.
Quite what effect a 0.5 percentage point rise in rates will have on the
economy is open to question. Given the wide gap between the old base rate of
5.25 per cent and most mortgage rates, yesterday's prompt action by the
Nationwide Building Society and the Abbey National bank in raising mortgage
rates was probably not in the authorities' scenario for developments after
the rate increase. However, the hesitancy of other mortgage lenders to
follow suit could point to a patchier than usual response among mortgage
lenders.
While many business organisations were predictably critical of the move, the
higher rates may not have too great an impact on corporate borrowers because
market rates had already discounted such a step.
The chancellor's move was politically brave. With the Tory party conference
four weeks away, the absence so far of a 'feel good factor' in the recovery
and the party's lamentable performance in the opinion polls had argued
against any increase in rates before November.
Instead, Mr Clarke yesterday clothed himself in monetary statesmanship.
Using vocabulary suitable for a Bundesbank council meeting, Mr Clarke
stressed the importance of low inflation for strong and lasting growth. He
had taken action now to avoid more drastic action later. Businessmen would
welcome the move because it promised stability. He hoped it would reassure
home buyers of the government's counter-inflationary resolve and influence
wage bargainers.
Indeed, the chancellor made clear that he believes there is political
advantage to be gained from running the economy in a way that keeps
inflation under control. His vision is of a Britain that is 'one of
strongest European economies', that 'is firing on all cylinders' and which
no longer is brought grinding to a halt by the need to bring down inflation
from double-digit levels.
It is unclear whether yesterday's rise in interest rates will achieve this
goal or whether further increases are in store. One senior official
suggested that the November meeting of chancellor and governor will be time
for a stock taking of its effect on the economy.
What is clear, however, is that UK monetary policy has embarked on a new era
of anticipating problems rather than responding to disaster.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Leading Article: FDP on the ropes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's Free Democratic Party, the kingmaker in virtually every coalition
since the founding of the federal republic, suffered another pair of
devastating electoral defeats at the weekend in east Germany. For six
elections in a row, the party has now failed to win the 5 per cent of the
vote needed to gain seats in state, federal and European parliaments. In the
eastern state of Saxony, the FDP won just 1.8 per cent, compared with 5.3
per cent in 1990. In neighbouring Brandenburg it did only marginally better,
with 2.2 per cent, although that was a sharp drop from the 6.6 per cent it
won four years ago. The electoral writing would appear to be truly on the
wall for the FDP.
As far as east German electors are concerned, it seems to have little to
offer. Its policies of liberal market economics, deregulation, and free
trade, combined with a mistrust of state interference at all levels, and a
liberal attitude to immigration and race relations, have failed to find any
response from the newly-enfranchised east Germans. One factor is clearly
that there is no real middle class to appeal to in the east. But another is
the signal failure of the FDP to find policies of relevance.
The trouble for the party of Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister,
is that it is scarcely better off in west Germany. Most political analysts
still expect the FDP to scrape into the Bundestag in the general election in
October, but it may well not have enough seats to repeat the present
coalition with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, or to form an alternative with the
opposition Social Democrats. The most likely outcome would then be a 'grand
coalition' of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats, which neither of the
big parties really wants, leaving the liberals out in the cold.
The FDP has no one to blame but itself for its plight. The party has been
too long in power, and shows no inspiration except in its desire to hang on
to it. It wants to distance itself from Mr Kohl, but cannot do so for fear
of losing what little appeal it still has. Too many years of being all
things to all men have taken their toll. The loss of the real voice of
liberalism from the German political debate would be severe. But it may take
a period in opposition to give that voice back its authority.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Bosnian bravado
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are two ways that external powers can influence the outcome of the war
in Bosnia-Hercegovina, if they so choose. One is to treat it as a war of
aggression and come to the aid of the victim (Bosnia) against the aggressor
(Serbia). The other is to treat it as a civil war, in which the various
parties are essentially on the same moral plane, and nudge them towards a
compromise peace while bringing relief, and where possible protection, to
the civilian victims.
The first strategy was what Bosnians were led to expect when the US and the
EC recognised their state and government in April 1992. Had it been followed
at that time, the arms embargo applied to Yugoslavia the previous year would
never have been applied to Bosnia.
Weapons would have been rushed to Bosnia along with training missions to
help the new state organise its armed forces and push back the Serb militias
which were partly infiltrated from Serbia and almost entirely armed and
trained by the former Yugoslav army. The Bosnian armed forces could have
been provided with western air cover. In that event, if external ground
troops had been sent they would have gone not as supposedly impartial
peacekeepers but as an expeditionary force to protect Bosnians from 'ethnic
cleansing' and help liberate the territory that had been occupied.
But it was not followed. The Bush administration, which with some justice
held the EC responsible for precipitating the war in Bosnia by its premature
recognition of Croatia and Slovenia, allowed Europe to take the lead. Within
Europe the Germans, feeling themselves disqualified by history from any
military role in the Balkans, deferred to Britain and France, both of which
took the second approach. In early 1993 Bill Clinton made a half-hearted
attempt to persuade Europe to switch to the first strategy under the rubric
of 'lift and strike', but backed off when Britain and France claimed a veto
over any policy that might imperil their contingents on the ground.
In 1994 an awkward compromise emerged which is short on logic and clarity
but has had some results, mainly because the five most influential external
powers have acted in unison. Broadly it is still the second approach, but
with greater pressure applied to the Serbs in an attempt to compensate for
the weakness of the Bosnian government and to redress at least part of the
wrong done to Bosnian Moslems. The contact group peace plan is hardly a
model of justice, but it would at least give Bosnian Moslems and Croats
enough space to live in without fighting each other, as they are bound to do
if they remain confined to less than 30 per cent of the country between
them. Moreover the Contact Group has scored a significant victory in getting
President Milosevic of Serbia to endorse the plan and to disavow the Bosnian
Serbs' rejection of it.
The Bosnian Serbs have never been so isolated. Having got so far, the
Contact Group should insist that Serbia co-operate in making that isolation
watertight, and wait for its effects to sink in. The threat of lifting the
embargo should be kept in the background. Actually lifting it would make
sense only if there were agreement by all parties to switch to the first
strategy, of helping the Bosnian government in a war to 'liberate' its
entire territory.
The truth is that no party, not even the US, is prepared to do this. Some
American legislators may imagine they can help the Bosnian Moslems as they
once helped the Afghan Mujahidin. The analogy is flawed in many respects;
but Afghanistan today gives all too convincing an image of what Bosnia might
look like in a few years' time if the Congressional 'strategy' were applied.

<TEXT>
Sir, I read with surprise A C Grayling's book review 'Balancing Terry
Maher's books' (September 10/11). Is Mr Grayling certain that he looked at a
balance sheet on Terry Maher? Accounting convention suggests that he has
been looking at Terry Maher's profit and loss account or bank statements
instead.
The credit side of a balance sheet is normally associated with liabilities
and the debit side with assets, therefore I would expect the memorable
events of Terry Maher's life to date to be recorded as assets at net book
value on the debit side of his balance sheet and the less memorable events
as liabilities at face value on the credit side.

<TEXT>
The half-point rise in British interest rates may not help the government,
but it could be a good career move for Mr Kenneth Clarke. The chancellor is
not one to let such an opportunity pass him by. He popped up everywhere
yesterday, presenting himself as a prudent, decisive and visionary national
treasurer of steely resolve and delicate touch. We are invited to believe
that he knows which monetary string to fine-tune, and when. It appears that
he has found the magic formula that has hitherto eluded economists in the
known universe. Yes, the self-styled canny Ken has discovered how to drive
an economy to the very borders of Utopia without mishap.
Neither you nor I nor Mr Clarke can be certain that this is so. Between you
and me, I have my doubts. It is not even clear whether the rise in base rate
was decided upon by the chancellor in happy concurrence with the governor of
the Bank of England. Quite possibly, Mr Eddie George was quietly insistent.
Thanks to Mr Clarke, the minutes of the meetings between the two are
published. This gives the governor the powerful weapon of disclosure should
the chancellor take a view different from his own. Either way, it would have
been in character for Mr Clarke to conclude that, if unpalatable medicine is
called for, it had better be administered at once.
Thus obliged, the chancellor has put his name to an increase in rates that
many will regard as sensible. He has also intimated, in his customary
manner, that there will be no tax cuts before the November 1995 Budget. In
short, he has come across as competent, and, better yet, a beacon of
stability. This should be to his credit. In the kingdom of the maladroit, he
who is capable earns respect and admiration. In due course this will benefit
the chancellor, in spite of much wringing of Tory hands over the higher cost
of mortgages.
Did I say maladroit? Such a kind epithet. This is not a sign of
commentator's softness; it is just that the ability of this government to
pound its own face with custard pies of its own making is beyond parody. We
need merely note the weekend performances by the prime minister and the
chairman of the Conservative party. The latter, a Mr Jeremy Hanley, took
only 24 hours to make a nonsense of the former's effort to convince us that
the Conservatives are the party of law and order. The prime minister needed
to do this because the home secretary, who should, hasn't. So on Friday Mr
Major spoke of countering Britain's 'yob culture'. That was unwise, since it
invited, and got, the riposte that the government has been in office for 15
years and we are now up to our eyes in yobs. Could anyone make things worse?
Yes. On Sunday the party chairman depicted a clash of yobs at a prize-fight
as a spot of exuberance. Later he apologised and said he doubted his own
suitability for the job.
Mr Hanley is famous for being the child of entertainers. It was curious of
Mr Major to appoint him. Perhaps he was thinking, in this 50th anniversary
year, of the wartime comedian, Tommy Handley, he whose show Itma ('It's That
Man Again') gave us Mrs Mopp with 'Can I do yer now, sir?' and Mona Lott
with 'It's being so cheerful that keeps me going'. Yesterday Mr Hanley was
twittering chirpy nothings about the forthcoming party conference while Mr
Clarke was raising interest rates. If the chairman of the Conservatives
continues the slapstick he has started, we must all smile sweetly and say:
'It's That Man Again.'
None of this would matter were it not for the government's desperate need to
show that it is in control of its own conduct, that it is in a position to
take two or three steps at a time without falling flat. Before the summer
break I wondered aloud whether we could detect signs that Mr Major was
getting better at his job. Not quite yet perhaps, but if he was blessed with
a good - lucky - summer, his party would discover that he had re-established
'grip', leadership, an ability to convey the sense that he and his ministers
were in charge and knew what they were doing. Alas for them, the
Conservatives have not had a good July and August. The government has come
out of it more spectacularly unpopular than it was in the spring. The prime
minister, poor chap, runs and runs and stays in the same place.
Quite possibly one cause is that other man again. As he indicates on the
page opposite, Mr Tony Blair is claiming for the Labour party the image of
financial rectitude that has fallen from the Conservatives' grasp. If the
chancellor and the governor perceive a need for an increase in rates, he
suggests, they must be right. Of course the new Labour leader also argues
that a government under his prime ministership would not have started from
here. It would have invested in infrastructure, education and training and
thus be running an economy that could sustain low inflation at a higher rate
of growth than achieved under the Conservatives.
This is the argument put over the past year or so by the shadow chancellor.
Mr Gordon Brown was away yesterday. Mr Blair's presentation of Mr Brown's
thesis is of greater significance than is accounted for by a clash of
diaries. We can take or leave the bit about Labour having the better formula
for growth. The key point is Mr Blair's carefully implied commitment to low
inflation. This may be interpreted as yet another tug of the party towards
the centre of British politics. It is all of a piece with his tilt away from
a pro-Catholic stance in Northern Ireland, his refusal to support the
railway signallers' strike, and his outspoken statement that a married
heterosexual couple is the best unit for the upbringing of children.
Britain's silent majority, conservative at heart, will doubtless be
comforted by such sentiments. Mr Major seeks to project a similar message.
He has shown courage and consistency in dealing with Northern Ireland, but
for the rest he is hamstrung. Since it has been there so long, the
government gets the blame for everything that goes wrong. It is so out of
favour that it cannot make political capital out of a prolonged and
irritating railway strike. This casts a shadow over the chancellor's
expectations of promotion. For while Mr Clarke may one day win the
leadership of the Conservative party, conservatives are looking to Labour
for their salvation.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Rate rise a low-risk move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr STEPHEN POPHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan in his article of September 8 (Economic Viewpoint)
castigates Goldman Sachs for trying to guess the non-inflationary growth
rate of the UK in its advice that interest rates ought to rise. There is,
however, a more subtle argument for raising interest rates soon than one
that sees renewed inflation around every corner and that relates to the
relative risks run in making the wrong decision.
Not to raise rates and to find that inflation takes a hold again would mean
that the harsh anti-inflationary medicine that the economy swallowed in 1992
was all in vain. And it would reinforce the image that the sceptics have of
the British economy as one prone to inflation and boom/bust cycles.
To raise rates, however, runs very little risk indeed. With the output gap
falling, Europe emerging from recession and the rest of the world for the
most part growing strongly, there is every reason to invest. And because
raising rates would reinforce the determination on the part of the monetary
authorities to provide a stable low inflationary environment, it could even
be argued that that would be positive for investment] If consumer
expenditure does take a dive, then interest rates can easily be lowered with
no longer-term damage (and anyway since, if the authorities are seen to be
ahead of the game, longer-term interest rates will surely fall, the impact
on consumer expenditure is likely to be quite mild).

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms RUTH EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report, 'Gas industry and users step up call for legislation'
(September 8), implies that all consumer groups want the government to
introduce competition in the domestic gas market at the earliest
opportunity. This is not the case.
The National Consumer Council believes much more information needs to be
made available before domestic consumers can be confident that the changes
will be to their benefit.
The ordinary gas user is caught between British Gas warning of steep price
rises and independent companies promising cuts. How can consumers make up
their minds when there is no detailed information on the new industries'
obligations and no independent cost-benefit analysis?
While we believe competition benefits consumers when it increases choice, we
are concerned that any real choice in a domestic gas market might only be
available to more affluent consumers living in particular geographical
areas. It certainly seems unlikely that companies will fight over the custom
of low-income households using pre-payment meters.
Regulation of gas supply since privatisation has led to lower bills for
consumers in real terms. We do not want to see a successful system
dismantled before the advantages of an open market for all consumers have
been established.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: No measure of competitiveness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GUNNAR MUNT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I enjoyed Frances Williams's critical remarks on the Institute for
Management Development competitiveness report (World Trade News: 'Lean and
mean, but is it fair?', September 7). Judging nations on the basis of a
bunch of economic, political and cultural indicators as if they are
competing against each other on these terms is nonsense.
As Paul Krugman convincingly argued in a recent article (Competitiveness: a
Dangerous Obsession, Foreign Affairs, March/April 1994) on the obsession of
national politics with competitiveness, wealth creation of countries or
companies cannot solely be matched with success on world markets or
competition for foreign direct investment (FDI). Although it is obvious that
national income depends on a variety of different factors, single national
characteristics should not be judged as if nations are competing on these
characteristics. Taken together they shape the economic structure of nations
 -but is there a general formula behind their respective impact?
Even if we focus on economic indicators, it is by no means clear that world
trade or FDI rank first in determining national wealth in each country.
Think, for example, of the US, Japan and France, which have reached high
levels of per capita income with low export quotas - instead of highly
obvious differences in their respective trade balances.
If, however, the analysis is limited to world market success, one should
focus on the structural failures of foreign trade - that is, on single
products or product groups. This micro-economic approach reveals much about
existing strengths and weaknesses of different countries - the more so where
trade among high-tech countries is concerned. As a matter of fact, sectoral
productivity and product-based technological leads are more valuable in
offering an explanation of foreign trade structures and the impact on
national income than the IMD indicator, which neither serves national
governments in shaping economic policy nor the real-world businessman.

FT  13 SEP 94 / A black and white morality tale: Patti Waldmeir reflects on
her time in S Africa
</HEADLINE>

Like nowhere else that I have ever lived, South Africa has seared my soul.
The grinding agony and the transcendent joys of the past five years, during
which I have been Financial Times correspondent in Johannesburg, have
touched me in a way that (I suspect) no country will ever do again.
I am not a particularly emotional person - my friends say rather a cynic and
a pessimist - but South Africa has got under my skin. It is a land of huge,
empty beauty, whose people have taught me confusing lessons in the nature of
the human spirit: immensely generous and chillingly brutal by turns, they
are extraordinary. Apartheid brought out the best and worst in them: it left
little room for the mediocre.
They have lived one of the most dramatic moments in the history of the human
spirit, and I have lived it with them. The liberation of blacks and
emancipation of whites from the twin burdens of oppression and guilt must
rank as among man's greatest positive achievements this century. I can
hardly believe I was lucky enough to watch it happen.
From the first, I was fascinated by the political theatre which is South
Africa; for nearly a decade, I have made it my life. In 1985, I arrived for
my first visit bearing the certain knowledge of good and evil which was the
common baggage of most foreigners: the Afrikaner was demon and the African
saint; there were no mixed tones in the black and white morality of the
place.
That vision did not survive my first week. Though the police behaved
predictably, shooting at mourners at a township funeral, the same funeral
generated an incident which disturbed the simple plot: mourners used the
'necklace' - the South African method of death by means of straitjacketing
the body with a burning tyre - to attempt the murder of a man standing near
me. Archbishop Desmond Tutu intervened, and the episode ended without
bloodshed; still, I found it hard to grasp the primordial hatred that could
spur such a deed. I still do.
I visited South Africa several times in 1985-86, years of township revolt
and state repression which left me certain the place would never escape from
its vortex of madness. They were years when I wondered about my own sanity,
too: I remember watching from a distant bridge as vigilantes hacked each
other to death in the KTC squatter camp near Cape Town; afterwards, I
returned to a luxury hotel for a hamburger and a beer. As though nothing -
or nothing worth noting - had happened.
Over the years, I am ashamed to say, this incongruity ceased to bother me: I
would return from some township conflict, take off my bullet-proof vest,
relax in my fragrant garden with a chilled glass of Cape wine, and
experience nothing other than relief. Or worse yet, I would simply stay in
the garden and leave the deathwatch to others.
South Africa was designed for that: laid out physically to ensure that the
worst black misery was invisible to whites who did not detour to see it;
socially structured to permit white masters and black servants to live
within metres of one another, yet never cross the gulf of privilege between
them; politically constructed so that, with few exceptions, only blacks
feared police brutality, the necklace or political murder. Whites had only
crime to worry about.
But always, the generosity of spirit of many, many Africans, and not a few
Afrikaners and other South Africans, defied those divisions. In the time
that I have known it, this most divided of societies has made great strides
to heal itself.
No one - certainly not I - would have believed it possible: reason cannot
explain it, nor cynicism grasp it.
Today the South African flag, which used to fly only behind barbed wire and
sandbags at embattled police stations, flutters in the garden of my
neighbour's house in a white suburb. The local radio station provides
lessons to its listeners in how to sing the two sectarian hymns chosen to
unite this land as a national anthem: Nkosi sikelel i'Afrika (God bless
Africa), the liberation anthem, and Die Stem, the theme song of apartheid.
Blacks practise singing Die Stem and whites stumble along with the
unfamiliar African syllables of Nkosi sikelel i'Afrika. And cynic that I am,
my eyes fill with tears.
This is not to suggest that South Africa has overnight attained national
nirvana. Earlier this month, three men were 'necklaced' in Duduza, the same
township where Bishop Tutu prevented the necklacing in 1985. The killings
were not political - the three were suspected car hijackers - but they were
nonetheless chilling for that. Like many things, they are a hangover from
the old South Africa.
Whites still grumble about blacks and vice versa; many whites refuse to sing
Nkosi sikelel i'Afrika and the black labour federation, Cosatu, sang only
the black national anthem at its recent congress.
But in so many other ways, the racial divide is being bridged. Most
Afrikaners have somehow found ways to adjust to a fate they always believed
would be worse than death: rule by the black man.
And at least in urban areas, where white and black often share the
colour-blind camaraderie of the workplace, race relations have undoubtedly
improved. So far, blacks have been magnanimous in victory and whites
gracious in defeat. That may change when the real struggle begins - the
battle over the redistribution of wealth - but it is a good start.
The credit for that goes to all the South Africans who have eschewed the
bitterness which one might have thought inevitable under apartheid.
But overwhelmingly, it goes to Nelson Mandela, who has charmed even his most
committed enemies since the day in May when he stood on the steps of
parliament in Cape Town, and placed his hand over his heart in respect for
the singing of Die Stem, anthem of his oppression.
I wore sunglasses that day to hide my tears from my more professional
colleagues, as Mandela gave this extraordinary public signal of forgiveness,
while white sharpshooters protected him from roof tops. I have needed my
sunglasses often as this strange and wonderful tale of collective liberation
has drawn to its conclusion. South Africa will never be the same again - but
then, neither will I.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Crisis helps advance ideological
positions on population growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof JAGDISH BHAGWATI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Edward Mortimer's article ('False alarm in Cairo', September 7) on the
Cairo conference on population misses the point in arguing that the
delegates miss the point by focusing on ideology rather than on population
growth which, in any case, can be expected to become 'nearly stationary' on
current trends.
As it happens, the complacent and comforting population projections that
Mortimer accepts are as fragile as the alarmist ones, if past projections
are any guide, which is why it has become customary to work with alternative
scenarios. Nor is Mortimer well advised to rely on economists who dissociate
hunger and destitution from population explosion. These scourges occur
despite the per capita availability of enough food to avoid them since need
and demand are two different things, but it is a non sequitur to conclude
that therefore they cannot occur due to pressure of population: in a raft at
sea with the last bottle of fresh water, Robinson Crusoe would do well
without Man Friday, you bet.
Even if you do not believe the alarmist estimates, however, it may be
prudent to rely on the precautionary principle. But many go with the
estimates for a different reason. They seek to create and then use a sense
of crisis to advance ideological positions, exaggerating in turn the impact
of their preferred policies to advance them as cures to the crisis. Just as
John Stuart Mill shrewdly observed that 'a good cause seldom triumphs unless
someone's interest is tied up in it', the women's groups that properly seek
empowerment and abortion rights see political value in a sense of crisis (no
matter how weak its intellectual underpinnings) that creates ferment, fuels
urgency and fertilises the ground for their causes to take root.
In fact, even the suggestion that female education - and Mortimer may well
have added female participation in the workforce - rather than ideology aids
population control draws a false contrast. Female education has generally
advanced because of ideology, not because of a cost-benefit calculation by
us economists of its value for population control or growth rates. That we
can simultaneously argue, thanks to the research of economists such as
Robert Repetto, that it advances these other causes, while being a good in
itself, is splendid: it enables us to do well while doing good.
But we must not forget that a good society will address precisely these
ideological questions at every opportunity, seeking progress in the
well-being of women that, astonishingly, still eludes them in every part of
the world.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Arts: Renaissance reworked - The artistic quality of
paintings rather than the subject is what really matters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The present public debate on the merits of figurative as opposed to abstract
painting is based on an unsustainable prejudice: that figurative is
inherently good; and that abstract is too easy - a snare and a delusion.
Yet there is clearly no objection to abstraction of itself - or where would
music be, or architecture, or the great decorative traditions of Islam and
the east? And what about the strange acknowledged power of the single,
simple stone standing in the middle of the field, or the middle of Whitehall
for that matter?
But the general feeling is that because the visual arts, and painting
especially, possess the facility of direct representation, then that
facility must be exercised, come what may. Yet it is never the mere
reference that makes the art, or every Crucifixion or Annunciation would be
as good as any other. The distinctions to be drawn between them are as
abstract, formal and intuitively obvious as those between any Mozart and
Salieri.
It is only the quality of what the artist does that matters, of whatever
kind, and in London we have work pass through the galleries, often
coincidentally, to make the very point. Paul Storey, at 37, is still quite
young, but the scope of his work, as much in its scale and technical
application as in its subject-matter, bespeaks an ageless ambition.
Certainly he is rare in attempting, as he has done consistently since his
student days, the full-dress subjects of the Renaissance tradition, both
sacred and profane - the Virgin Mary or The Baptism of Christ on the one
hand, Agamemnon or The Rape of Helen on the other.
He has studied deeply the art of 15th century Italy, of Fra Angelico and
Piero della Francesca in particular, to which in costume and architecture
his reference is insistent. Yet the cocktail is more complex than that, for,
to add to the Italian serene, there is more than a pinch of the northern
grotesque and fantastical. And while again he stays with the 15th century,
and with Bosch, he also seems closer to our own times in this respect, to
Victorian fairy painters such as Richard Dadd, and to the great Edwardian
illustrator, Arthur Rackham.
But it is this grotesque aspect, always markedly characteristic of Storey's
work - and a most effective device besides by which to draw attention to a
young artist - which now seems increasingly forced and artificial. When
mannerism becomes affectation, it ceases to serve, and here too often we
have an histrionic distortion that attracts attention only to itself. The
encouraging thing is that Storey now makes the point himself in so many of
the smaller, less overtly ambitious works, the small, straight forward heads
especially, which are by far the best things shown. This is an accomplished
show which makes us look forward positively to the next.
Ellsworth Kelly's new paintings could hardly afford a greater contrast. Now
over 70, Kelly is an American painter and sculptor who came to prominence in
the 1950s and early '60s upon the wave of minimalist reaction to the
tuff-boot extravagance of abstract expressionism. And if anyone is to give
minimalism a good name, it is he. Yet the bare description of his work must
give any sceptic ammunition - a roomful of variations upon the simple
sector, either variously imposed upon a square white canvas as a blue,
green, red or yellow figure, or presented simply as a discrete red or white
panel: a pure white square canvas set askew upon a black, or a green upon a
blue; a large yellow equilateral triangle set on its side with a smaller
black right-angled triangle; an orange right-angled triangle and a grey
chord set together upon the mutual vertical.
And of course we all could do as well, given the same refinement of
sensibility and exquisite nicety of judgment. We worry too much about the
artist and the apparent simplicity of his work, and tend to forget that the
work, on its own terms, actually works. Kelly gives us now the subtlest
chromatic dissonance, now the gentlest of harmonies: the composition now
formal and monumental, now light and active, the contours sprung taut as a
bow. And it all acts upon the eye and the sympathetic imagination like a
drop of pure water falling into a clear pool.
Two floors above the Kelly, at Annely Juda, we have a last chance to see
Line + Movement, a small but magisterial show of work from the European
abstract constructivist tradition from which Kelly himself springs - indeed
it includes a work of his of 1959. It is a selection of very high quality,
from Fritz Glarner and Naum Gabo to Max Bill and Kenneth Martin. Best of all
it has a group of paintings from 1927 by Mondrian in his prime. Arrangements
of rectangular black lines on an off-white ground, selectively filled in
with blue and red and yellow, nothing more, and they sing like Lorenzo's
angels. You have until Saturday to hear them.
Paul Storey - New Paintings: Jason &amp; Rhodes, 4 New Burlington Place W1,
until October 15. Ellsworth Kelly - New Paintings: Anthony d'Offay Gallery,
21, 23 &amp; 24 Dering Street W1, until October 18. Line + Movement: Annely Juda

FT  13 SEP 94 / Arts: More guidance for 'Babies' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New plays by young and unknown authors seldom have the success enjoyed by
Jonathan Harvey's Beautiful Thing, which told the love story of two teenage
boys in a south-east London apartment block. New last year at the Bush, it
was taken up by the West Yorkshire Playhouse, and enjoyed a successful
season this spring at the Donmar Warehouse. Most of those who saw it loved
it, I think, and most of us who loved it found it unusually touching, funny,
and realistic. It had its faults - too sentimental an ending - but it was
the kind of play we wanted our friends to see and enjoy too.
Now the Royal Court is giving Harvey's latest play Babies - which was
originally developed and presented at the Royal National Theatre Studio. It,
too, is funny and touching and realistic; it, too, is set in south-east
London and concerns the sexual problems of teenagers and the adults in their
lives; and this time the sentimentality is less marked. But Babies is a
mess. Several of its scenes and characters and lines have you roaring with
laughter - and yet the play falls apart while you are watching it.
Some of the blame here must go not to Harvey but to his director, Polly
Teale. Beautiful Thing has the merit of an exceptionally truthful and
realistic staging by Hettie Macdonald; the south-east London created at the
Royal Court by Teale is rather obviously choreographed and safe and
audience-conscious. As you walk in, the kids are up there onstage, as if in
the school playground; and though it is just darling watching them - what
age are all these young performers? - nothing quite rings true.
And some of the blame must go to the Royal Court and/or the National Theatre
Studio. I have rarely been so aware of a play's need of editorial guidance
while I was watching it as here: especially in its second half. Joe, a
24-year-old teacher, is gay and has problems with his boyfriend Woody, who
has problems with drugs. He is, however, a good teacher, and goes so far as
to attend 14-year-old Tammy's birthday party. Not only does Tammy's
32-year-old widowed mother Viv set her cap at him, so does Viv's gay brother
Kenny. Guess which one is disappointed. All of this has plenty of potential.
Then, however, Kenny starts to rape Joe; and then a drag queen arrives,
dressed as the Queen, as the surprise guest for Tammy's birthday; and then
Viv gets into a massive fight with a neighbour; amid which Joe goes, only to
find that Woody has stayed off drugs tonight, and so the two of them are
happy and lovey-dovey. The rape scene is the most distasteful here, less
because it is graphic than because it is set up as mere farce frolic. But
the drag queen scene is just as awkward; like the rape, it sets up far more
questions than Harvey seems to realise. After these two crises, Joe's
happy-again homecoming is so safe as to be gruesomely escapist.
These problems tend to wipe away the memories of the really uproarious
comedy that Harvey does create in some scenes. The gay line 'You were so far
back in the closet you were in f***ing Narnia' deserves to be a classic. The
best touch in the play occurs, albeit too late, in the final scene, when
David, a 14-year-old, is bullied for having wanted to have sex with Tammy.
The ironies - he didn't, and so what anyway? especially after everything
else we've seen - are splendid. And, as David, Ricci Harnett gives the most
touching and convincing performance in the cast. Elsewhere, however, charm
and realism are marred by audience-consciousness.
At the Royal Court Theatre, SW1

<TEXT>
Today's current affairs offerings look more promising than anything in the
drama and light entertainment categories, though ITV's half-hour police
drama, The Bill, maintains a high standard (8.00). BBC2 reports on the
increasingly tough, and increasingly American, attitude towards student
grants in the UK in Taken For Granted. Demanding that people 'work their
way' through university is fine when there are jobs to be had, but more
problematical during periods of high unemployment. Even with government
loans to students we now seem perilously close to a system which provides
higher education mainly for those with rich parents (7.20). Dirty Money
opened last week with a racy account of the (pretty fruitless) attempt to
reduce cocaine dealing by confiscating the suppliers' funds. Today's
programme (10.25 BBC1) is about the rapid growth of 'gangster capitalism' in
Russia where there seems to be little legislation to say what you can and
cannot do. ITV ends its exhaustive investigation of 'acquaintance rape' in
Network First with the actual trial. (10.40).

FT  13 SEP 94 / Arts: Fine singers at the Wigmore - Music in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Wigmore Hall's International Festival of Song is bringing to London this
autumn some of the most exciting young voices around. Last week we heard
Dawn Upshaw, Olaf Bar and Barbara Bonney - all fine singers who did not,
however, fulfil every expectation.
Bonney's recital on Thursday seemed designed to show off her beautiful tone
 -at once light and lustrous - but it also revealed the limitations of her
instrument. A little variety in the mostly slow, all-Lieder programme might
have helped. Her opening group, Ruckert settings by both Robert and Clara
Schumann, afforded scope for ravishing singing: Robert's 'Mein schoner
Stern' (a wedding present to his wife) was infused with radiance, and Bonney
also caught the lilting beauty of Clara's 'Liebst du um Schonheit' - so
different from Mahler's version.
The American soprano (accompanied by Geoffrey Parsons with dull
professionalism) found a freshness in the Schubert songs (like 'Die
Forelle') so familiar that they are often overlooked, but some of her
Schubert was perhaps too slow and self-conscious. Bonney appeared
temperamentally better suited to the Mahler Knaben Wunderhorn selection we
heard after interval, even though she did not command enough variety of
colour to sustain interest in the long 'Wo die schonen Trompeten blasen'.
Berg's Seven Early Songs rounded off the evening effectively, drawing
together as they do influences of 19th-century Lieder and providing Bonney
with haunting lines to float very appealingly.
It was similarly difficult, in Tuesday's recital devoted to the 46 songs of
Wolf's Italian Songbook, always to know whether to blame performer or
composer for the limited range of expression in Dawn Upshaw's singing. Wolf
assigned most of the cycle's lighter songs to the soprano, leaving the more
serious ones to the male voice. Upshaw's tone is bright and fresh, and well
suited to the innocence of such songs as 'Auch kleine Dinge', but the
humorous and vengeful cameos were a little shallow.
She was overshadowed by the interpretative powers of her partner, Olaf Bar,
who found the dark drama of his songs in performances that sounded almost
sculpted. The baritone was totally at ease and it helps to have a native
German singing these words. He has reserves of operatic power, but was most
impressive in the stillness of 'Sterb ich, so hullt' and the serenity of
'Benedeit die sel'ge Mutter'. Helmut Deutsch was a colourful pianist who
brought each one of the miniatures to life with insightful musicianship.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Arts: Maazel and the Pittsburgh - Music in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most recent occasion that the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra attracted
attention in Britain was when a BBC documentary last year revealed the huge
sums paid out to secure the services of its music director, Lorin Maazel.
The good people of Pittsburgh put a high price on civic pride.
Although it is not one of the inner circle of great American orchestras, the
Pittsburgh Symphony is good enough to hold a place on the international
stage. Is it obviously American from the way it plays? Difficult to say: the
brass is dominant and there is a punchiness about the playing which is
certainly transatlantic, but those may just be dominating characteristics of
its music director.
Whatever his drawbacks, Maazel gets spick-and-span ensemble out of an
orchestra. The two concerts by the Pittsburgh Symphony in the last week of
the Proms followed on a series by some of the world's great orchestras and
although it does not compare with the rich and cultivated sounds made by
Berlin and Dresden respectively, it always knew what it was doing. The
playing was decisive and remarkably clear.
Maazel is less a conductor than a musical surgeon. In the first concert
Rakhmaninov's Third Symphony found him scalpel in hand. He analysed,
clarified and dissected the score, slowly laying out its bare bones before
him. The operation was performed with impressive precision, but only because
the heart was dead. This symphony has rarely seemed so cold: the slow
movement had no lyrical flow, the finale was never joyous.
More pleasure was afforded in this first programme from hearing the wealth
of detail in the 20th-century music after the interval. Maazel's ear
uncovered many precise timbres and rhythms in Ravel's Rapsodie espagnole and
Julian Rachlin was no less proficient a soloist, with a big tone for one so
young, in Prokofiev's First Violin Concerto.
The second concert was all Beethoven: the Eighth and Ninth Symphonies, the
latter a prerequisite for the Proms' penultimate night. Typically, Maazel
was at his best where the emotions get least involved, as in the
metronome-like tick-tock of the Eighth's second movement or the Ninth's
unrelenting scherzo. Outer movements were delivered with rigorous accents,
which became pedantic when Maazel decided to underline crucial
turning-points in the structure. In sum, the Eighth worked, thanks to its
energy and brilliance; the Ninth predictably offered no sense of the
spiritual and fell short.
The finale of the Ninth is a great Prom rabble-rouser, especially when it is
sung by a choir as large and well-rehearsed as the Philharmonia Chorus.
Gregg Baker led the 'Ode to Joy' superbly, the best of a big-voiced quartet,
including Nina Rautio, Linda Finnie and John Horton Murray.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Business and the Law: One victim to help another - More
careful control is needed of methods to trace assets missing in alleged
fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT HUNTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Much has been written about the explosion of fraud in recent years and the
dramatic growth of legal methods of locating and recovering the stolen
assets. These methods are vital weapons for victims of fraud who need to
know, often very quickly, what has become of the money taken from them.
Some of these remedies - for example the 'Mareva injunction' by which the
defendant's assets are frozen until trial - have worked extremely well and
are operated cautiously and fairly. There are, however, grounds for concern
over the way others can be misused.
Many of the problems arise from the fact that fraud actions frequently
involve reliance upon a 'proprietary claim' by the plaintiff. This is a
claim by the victim of the fraud that the proceeds of it still belong to him
although they have been transferred to third parties.
Proprietary claims are particularly important to plaintiffs who believe that
the defendant is likely to become insolvent. If the plaintiff has a
proprietary claim over the proceeds of the fraud, he will not have to share
them with other creditors if the fraudster becomes bankrupt. Proprietary
claims are also important where the defendant has 'given the money away' to
a spouse, friends or trustees, or passed them on to others who had reason to
believe that they were derived from a fraud. Such people, if the plaintiff
can identify them and prove that they have received the proceeds of the
fraud, can usually be made to repay what they have received.
If the plaintiff is able to persuade the court that he has an 'arguable'
proprietary claim over the proceeds of an alleged fraud, the court will
usually grant orders to help him to find out what has become of them. This
is so that he can find out who is holding them and, in appropriate cases,
sue those people for their return.
It is common sense that all of these people should be sued at the same time.
For this reason, the court will assist the plaintiff to ascertain where the
money is and who holds it (in the so-called tracing process) before it
requires him to prove at a trial that the money belongs to him.
In order to enable him to find where the money has gone and what it has been
used for, the court will grant a plaintiff who may have a good proprietary
claim tracing remedies and investigative powers which rival, and in some
respects exceed, those available to the police.
As a start to the tracing process the defendant will usually be ordered to
serve an affidavit saying what has become of the proceeds of the alleged
fraud. Providing this information can be a huge task. The money may have
been split up into numerous parts over many years. The ultimate destination
of each part will have to be revealed, and any documents relating to the use
of the money will have to be collated and disclosed to the plaintiff.
While this exercise is often time-consuming for the defendant, it is usually
justified if the only alternative is that the plaintiff would be unable to
locate money which might ultimately turn out to be his.
The problem is that the tracing process may not end with the affidavit. If
it is not absolutely clear where the proceeds have gone or what they have
been used for, this is frequently only the beginning of a series of further
applications made, as one judge put it, in 'the excitement of the chase'.
These might, for example, be designed to obtain further documents, to see
lawyers' papers (which are not 'privileged' when generated for the purpose
of fraud), to appoint a receiver over the proceeds of the fraud to
administer 'interrogatories' (written questions which must be answered on
oath), to cross-examine the defendant on his affidavit and so on. It is
possible for lawyers experienced in fraud claims to keep the tracing process
running almost indefinitely with applications of this nature.
It is sometimes too tempting to a plaintiff who does not wish to go to the
expense (and possibly the risk) of having his action tried to look for an
easier route to retrieve the money. The pressure created by these further
orders made in the name of the tracing exercise often appear to provide this
route.
Sometimes, the defendant may find it difficult to believe the plaintiff can
be entitled to inflict such inconvenience and expense upon him without the
issues having been somehow prejudged, and so he may become demoralised. In
other cases, these orders may give the litigation an additional 'nuisance
value' in settlement negotiations.
In the remainder, the result (whether achieved through settlement or trial)
will remain the same - only the cost and the time taken to achieve it will
be considerably greater.
The problem is not with the tracing process itself - for the victim of a
fraud it is frequently vital. It is that the courts are sometimes reluctant
to require plaintiffs to show the orders they seek are genuinely needed to
assist them.
When the court becomes too passive in supervising the tracing process
matters can get out of hand. Several large fraud cases have involved months
of these sorts of wrangles before trial as the parties become entangled in
time-consuming applications and counter-applications ostensibly as part of
the tracing process, but in reality seeking to inflict pressure or
inconvenience on one's opponent or searching for that elusive knock-out
blow.
The situation can sometimes resemble Charles Dickens' Jarndyce v Jarndyce,
where the parties have become so immersed in litigation that they have all
but forgotten its original purpose.
Nobody could sensibly object to the need for powerful remedies to assist
victims of fraud. So powerful are the remedies which have been developed
that control of them is needed to ensure that they do not give rise to
victims of their own.
The purpose of litigation procedures such as the tracing process should be
to ensure a quick and effective trial of the issues in dispute - not to
afford a means of imposing unnecessary pressure and expense to prevent one.

FT  13 SEP 94 / People: Deaner dives out of MSR chair
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Martyn Deaner, 49, the entrepreneur at the centre of one of the North Sea's
more spectacular financial disasters, has resigned as chairman of Midland &amp;
Scottish Resources, the loss-making company operating the Emerald oilfield
off the Scottish coast.
He is the biggest individual shareholder in MSR which was the stock market's
top performing share in 1989 when its shares nudged 200p. They are now
standing at 2 1/4 p. The company says Deaner 'felt his resignation was
appropriate in the light of claims for repayment made against him by lenders
from whom he has borrowed or guaranteed in support of his investment in
Midland &amp; Scottish Resources'.
Deaner, a former diver, was appointed chairman in May 1989 shortly after his
private company came to the stock market through a reverse takeover of
Jebsens Drilling, a loss-making offshore drilling company. His aim was to
create a business providing low-cost development systems for small oilfields
that might otherwise remain unexploited.
The idea was that MSR would use the money it earned from operating its first
project, the Emerald Field, to help pay for its floating production system
which could then be re-used as cheap production facilities for other small
oilfields. A year after Deaner took over as chairman, MSR launched a Pounds
149m rights issue.
However, the Emerald field project ran into financial problems because of
production delays, cost over-runs and the fact that there was less oil than
first thought. This compounded MSR's problems since it owned a big chunk of
the field. Over the past three years MSR has made pre-tax losses of Pounds
191m.
Jack Birks, 74, who retired as a managing director of BP in 1982, has taken
over as chairman. MSR says that Deaner's resignation will not affect the
day-to-day management of the company and his services will continue to be
available on a consultancy basis.

Supermarket group ASDA has appointed Michael Fleming, 33, as marketing
director. Fleming is currently marketing director of Somerfield, the
supermarket chain formerly known as Gateway.
Fleming fills the gap left by former marketing director Allan Leighton's
move last January to become Asda's retail director, overseeing store
operations and the programme of store refurbishments or 'renewals'.
He will be building on the work Leighton has done to reposition the UK's
fourth largest grocer as a retailer providing the weekly shopping needs of
'ordinary working people and their families'. This has involved lowering
prices, strengthening the Asda brand and reintroducing the 'Asda Price'
slogan and advertising campaign.
A graduate of Oxford and Insead, Fleming has previously worked for
Storehouse, the UK clothing retailer, and US investment bank Morgan Stanley.

FT  13 SEP 94 / People: Santacroce's pow wow with Aquascutum
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
George Santacroce, president and chief executive of the US and Canadian
operations of Aquascutum, the upmarket UK-based clothing retailer, has left
the company after a restructuring of management.
The North American businesses are now being run directly from London by
James Pow, managing director of Aquascutum group since last November. Pow
becomes group chief executive, the new title reflecting his wider
responsibilities.
Pow, formerly with the upmarket men's clothing retailer Hackett, part of
Dunhill group, has made it a priority to regain control of the Aquascutum
brand name. He felt it was being applied to many unsuitable products around
the world.
His first task was to centralise management, bringing the international
divisions in the US, Canada, Europe and east Asia under direct control of
London.
Many functions were centralised, ending the 'spider's web of overlapping
functions' that existed when Pow arrived.
The passing of control over the northern American operations to London last
month effectively left Santacroce without a role, but his departure was
described by the company as amicable.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Technology: The price of freedom - Why research science is
different in the private and public sectors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW DERRINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business and academia have drawn closer in recent years in the UK, but
cultural differences can still stand in the way of a fruitful relationship.
Oxford University's Department of Experimental Psychology, for example, has
carpet tiles that need to be stuck back into place whereas research
facilities in the private drugs sector are sparkling - Glaxo's new Pounds
670m complex at Stevenage, for instance, gives visitors overshoes to protect
the marble floors.
Such differences are often more to do with funding than with culture, but
represent one facet of a more profound gulf between academic and industrial
research. The two communities 'operate in entirely different ways', says Sue
Iversen, head of the Oxford department.
Iversen knows both disciplines from the inside. She was an academic at
Cambridge University until 11 years ago, when she moved to the drug company
Merck, Sharp &amp; Dohme. At the time, says Iversen, her research was 'on an
all-time high', but she was drawn by 'the challenge of having huge resources
to design a laboratory from the ground up'.
Although 'very satisfied with my time at Merck', Iversen felt ready for a
new challenge, and came back to academia after 10 years because 'the only
job I had not done was to run a major university department'.
Now at Oxford, Iversen carries out research on the brain's chemical
messenger systems and their relationship to anxiety, schizophrenia and
Parkinson's disease - an area of intense activity in both sectors. Academics
want to understand how these fundamental mechanisms of the brain control our
behaviour. Drug companies want to develop treatments for the disabling
illnesses that result from their malfunction.
It is the difference between these two goals, says Iversen, that leads
academics and industrialists to operate differently.
In the universities, neuroscientists set their own research agendas.
Independence and academic freedom are not only fundamental, but are taken
for granted.
But academics feel they pay dearly for their freedom. They can decide what
research they want to do, but there is no guarantee it will be funded. Less
than a quarter of the best projects are successful in the national
competition for research funds. A consequence of this can be that
second-rate academics succeed by being good at marketing their ideas.
In drug companies, wasting expensively trained human capital on
under-resourced research projects would be unthinkable. Research priorities
are set by the company's needs and goals.
This trade-off between resources and freedom figured heavily in Iversen's
decision to move to industry. The change in emphasis from trying to
understand the brain to seeking remedies for its malfunctions also excited
her, as she had been working in areas related to mental and neurological
illnesses.
The most exciting aspect of Iversen's time in industry sprang from the way
that drug discovery brings together scientists from different disciplines.
The opportunity to collaborate with chemists on drug design, using computers
to view the shapes of drug molecules and to investigate how molecular
structure could predict biological activity, was something she had never
dreamed of. This co-operation with chemists streamlined the hit-and-miss
process of selecting chemicals to be tested as potential drugs, says
Iversen.
Her worries before moving to Merck, Sharp &amp; Dohme focused on the management
of research. 'I wasn't attracted by going in with a big stick and bossing 20
scientists around, instead of leaving my research students to do brilliant
things on their own.'
In fact, managing research teams had more to do with distributing carrots
than wielding sticks. The most difficult part of the job was to maintain the
motivation of team members, 'especially those whose contribution wasn't by
being brilliant'.
Iversen says one advantage of working in the private sector is the ability
to motivate with bonuses. She believes performance-related pay is an
important tool for maintaining motivation in the long term. But in the short
term, or when all the money available for bonuses has been spent, 'the only
way is to give people an appreciation of how much their work contributes to
the project'.
Iversen says her time in the private sector was invaluable for her Oxford
job. Persuading independent-minded academics to adopt a team approach makes
administration much easier. But, she says, 'the most important aspect of the
head of department's role is in identifying potential high fliers and
protecting them from being overburdened by teaching and trivial
administrative duties.'
Iversen's ability to influence research funding inside her department is
minimal. Her staff must compete for outside funds. All she can do is
encourage them to write proposals, and try to maintain morale.
She has strong views on how meagre funds should be targeted - she sits on
two national science funding committees, the council of the Biotechnology
and Biological Sciences Research Council and the Wellcome Trust's
Neuroscience Committee.
'Universities must be the place where 'blue-skies' research is done,' she
says. 'We must jealously guard resources for long-shots, and to help
newcomers get started.
'The most important thing is to make more use of outcome measures in
allocating research funds,' she adds.
Her other main point is that funds should be concentrated: 'You have to put
the money in centres and individuals of excellence.' By concentrating funds
in this way the UK can hope to end up with a small number of world-class
academic research centres. 'Modern science will make it increasingly
difficult for one man and his dog to operate in isolation,' says Iversen.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Technology: Bird's eye view of the sun - Today's high point
for Ulysses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ulysses, the first spacecraft to break free from the plane of our solar
system, will reach the climax of a 3bn km voyage today when it flies above
the south pole of the Sun.
The Dollars 750m (Pounds 480m) Ulysses mission is a joint project of the US
and European space agencies, dedicated to exploring the heliosphere. This
region contains mainly ions (charged atoms) and electrons emanating from the
Sun - a bubble blown inside the extremely thin cold gas of interstellar
space by the Sun's hot breath, the solar wind. It encompasses the whole
solar system, except for the planets and their atmospheres.
Because the planets were formed from a disc of debris around the newborn Sun
about 5bn years ago, they all lie within one plane, known as the ecliptic,
which is tilted only slightly from the Sun's equatorial plane.
To explore the solar wind and magnetic field, free of the turbulence and
other complications caused by the planets, John Simpson of the University of
Chicago proposed in 1959 sending a space probe over the Sun's poles. The
idea became technically feasible in the 1970s, and in 1977 the European
Space Agency agreed to collaborate with Nasa on the Ulysses project.
No rocket is strong enough on its own to send a spacecraft out of the
ecliptic, because it has to cancel Earth's motion around the Sun of 30
km/sec and build up speed in a new direction. But Ulysses' designers
realised that they could use the gravitational pull of the giant planet
Jupiter to propel their car-sized probe into a new plane, like a slingshot
(see diagram).
All went well from 1977 until 1980, when the project began an odyssey of
setbacks and delays, caused mainly by technical and financial difficulties
at Nasa. Ulysses was eventually launched on a Space Shuttle in October 1990,
seven and a half years after the original target date.
Once in space, Ulysses performed perfectly. Project scientists took
advantage of its swing past Jupiter in February 1992 to make the first
detailed survey of the gigantic system of electrical currents, particles and
magnetic fields surrounding the planet.
On route to the Sun's south pole, the nine scientific instruments on Ulysses
have already made important discoveries about the heliosphere: shock waves
in the solar wind; electromagnetic waves with a very long period (more than
10 hours); regular bursts of energetic particles from the Sun; enormous
clouds of ionised gas; and unexpected patterns of cosmic radiation from
elsewhere in the galaxy. The investigators are still working out the
significance of these observations.
'This is our first ever 'bird's eye view' of the Sun's magnetic poles,' says
Roger Bonnet, Esa's science director. 'This new perspective will cast some
light on the origins of the solar wind and is going to improve our models of
the solar interior.
'It may also enable us to anticipate better the variations of solar activity
and forecast their effect on Earth,' he adds. For example, Ulysses may give
some clues about the impact of the 11-year sunspot cycle on terrestrial
climate.
Although the mission has taken so long to gestate and execute, some
old-timers are still involved. Willis Meeks, Nasa's Ulysses project manager,
has been working on it for 16 years. And Simpson, the 'father of Ulysses',
is in charge of the largest of the nine experiments, which looks at the
behaviour of cosmic rays in the solar wind. 'I have had plenty of
opportunities to fly experiments on other missions,' he says. 'But Ulysses
remains unique, as the first and only foreseeable mission to the polar
regions of the Sun's heliosphere.'
The spacecraft's new polar orbit will carry it over the Sun's north pole
next summer. Although current plans call for the mission to end in October
1995, Esa and Nasa are keen to continue observing until the end of 2001.
They say the modest extra cost, Dollars 50m, would pay large scientific
dividends because the current observations coincide with a quiet period on
the Sun, whereas 2000-2001 will be a period of maximum solar activity.
Whatever happens next, Ulysses has already paid off in Simpson's eyes. 'We
don't have to wonder any longer whether the results will justify the effort
and reward the long wait,' he says. 'We already know they do.'

FT  13 SEP 94 / Management (The Growing Business): When big is seen as
better - How Trinity Capital found a way to grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More consolidation within the UK venture capital industry will be announced
today. Trinity Capital, founded 10 years ago by John Walker and Ron Sheldon
with a brief to invest in high-technology growth companies, is to become
part of Advent International.
Walker will take over as managing director of Advent International's
European operations, replacing Doug Brown who becomes chairman of Advent
International Europe and worldwide chief investment officer.
The two groups say they will be combining Advent's European strength in
speciality chemicals, media companies, information technology and
communications with Trinity's expertise in the healthcare and environmental
sectors.
But the fundamental reason is that Trinity would not have been able to raise
a new fund to invest at the size it desired in growth companies. By finding
a home within Advent International, another specialist lender, which has
Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 909m) under management worldwide and has just raised
Dollars 315m to invest in western Europe, that is no longer an obstacle.
'This allows us to do the kind of investing that we could not do before,'
says Walker.
Trinity had wanted to move towards investing in companies at a later stage
of their development, when they would generally already be making profits
and require larger sums of development capital.
'Our experience was telling
us we needed larger deals,' Walker says. He needed to raise a Pounds 100m
fund and would not have been able to do that given the returns on Trinity's
existing funds.
Brown says the merger gives Advent two sectors in Europe where it has not
been very active and also more British directors. 'We are redeploying
Trinity's skills into that sector of the market that will be dominated by
larger deals,' he says.
'Trinity was really relegated to the smaller ranks by the size of the funds
they were managing.'
The market has known for some time that Trinity has been considering a
merger. Other groups talking to Trinity included Rothschild Ventures,
industry sources say.
The financial structure of the transaction is interesting. When Mercury
Asset Management bought Grosvenor Ventures in February in one of the most
significant consolidations in the industry, it paid Pounds 4.5m.
Walker says no money is changing hands in Trinity's merger with Advent
International; Trinity's partners will retain rights to any carried interest
in its four funds which have invested Pounds 75m. 'This is an investment in
the future and not in the past,' he says.
The consolidation is more proof that the ranks of early-stage development
capital financiers are thinning out.
Walker says Trinity's returns have been 'on the border line'. While its
venture capital returns would be competitive with other early-stage
investors, this return does not stack up against the returns achieved by
funds concentrating on management buy-outs, he says.
Trinity and Advent International have co-operated on deals over seven years,
and say they share a common style in trying to develop growing businesses.
Five of Trinity's active executives will join Advent, including Sheldon. Of
the other three, two will remain with responsibility for a 3i-backed
innovation fund and will be found a home by 3i, according to Walker.
The other partner, Philip Percival, who concentrates on IT and therefore
overlaps with an existing area of Advent expertise in Europe, will be
'pursuing other interests', Trinity says.
As Walker moves forward with a new partner and more power to underwrite
deals than he has had before, he has a word of advice for other smaller fund
managers.
'It is my view that those who sort their future out now have better options
than those who run out of money,' he says.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Breaking with tradition -
A look at how Japan's subcontractors are coping with customer demands and a
rising yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's army of subcontractors, the hidden muscle power of its industrial
economy, are learning the hard way that they must become more than mere foot
soldiers to survive.
Their famed ability to cut costs and increase efficiency is coming under
unprecedented strain as subcontractors' powerful customers demand another
round of price cuts, for a record fourth year running.
Just as Japan seems to be on the brink of coming out of recession,
subcontractors are being asked to shoulder their share - some complain even
more than their share - of the cost disadvantage inflicted by another rise
in the yen's value.
A look at the contrasting experiences of three subcontractors around Osaka,
the heartland of Japan's electronics industry, shows that the pressure on
costs has started to disturb - but not destroy - the formerly intimate bonds
between parent companies and their multiple domestic suppliers.
It also indicates that suppliers able to follow their clients to cheaper
locations overseas, especially in the rest of Asia, are most likely to
prosper.
Takizawa Precision Gear, a producer of machine-tool gears with 14 staff, has
taken a traditionally Japanese approach to a problem, by stepping up the
search for internal self-improvement.
Its neighbour, Meisei Metal Industries, a 140-person maker of metal dies for
the car industry, has joined forces with other subcontractors to seek
economies of scale. Showa Plastics, a producer of plastic casings with 2,200
employees, has behaved like a Japanese multinational. It has closed more
than half its domestic production and relocated next to its Japanese buyers'
new overseas plants.
The trio hold very different ranks in Japan's feudal-style industrial
structure, but they share one thing: the realisation that near total
dependence on a single large client is not the guarantee of survival it used
to be for most of Japan's post-1950s economic expansion.
Local bankruptcy figures are a grim illustration.
At the start of Japan's recession in 1991, bankruptcies in Osaka grew faster
than the number of new businesses for the first time. The sad trend has
stayed that way, says Moriyuki Tsuda, director of industrial research at
Osaka prefecture.
'Customers are less loyal than in old times,' says Kiyoshi Takizawa,
president of Takizawa Precision Gear.
'Sooner or later 20 per cent or 30 per cent of companies in our field will
go out of business,' says Yozo Ueda, vice-president of Meisei Metal
Industries.
'Toshiba, Hitachi and Sony are more willing to buy from me in Singapore than
in Tokyo. They won't even see me in Tokyo,' says Kenzo Nakagawa, president
of Showa Plastics.
Takizawa is at the bottom of a so-called 'co-prosperity' pyramid, headed by
Osaka-based Matsushita, Japan's largest consumer electronics group. The
upper echelons include about 500 prime contractors - closely bound to
Matsushita - while Takizawa is among the more than 6,000 smaller suppliers
which will also sell to several other large companies.
The parallel with the feudal system becomes visible on visiting Takizawa's
plant, part of an enormous industrial village and consisting of a dense
jumble of factories, rice fields and homes on the outskirts of Osaka.
Takizawa, whose father founded the business 44 years ago, devotes 40 per
cent of annual sales to his top three customers. This is a big enough
exposure to make it impossible for the company to resist their demands for
price cuts of between 5 per cent and 15 per cent every year for the past
four years.
Sales have shrunk from Y300m (Pounds 1.95m) to Y200m over the same period,
perilously close to Takizawa's Y180m break-even point.
Instead of sacking his tiny workforce, Takizawa has instead increased
spending on training, borrowed Y50m to re-equip with Swiss machine tools and
carried out an engineering cost analysis.
His strategy of investing through a recession was typical of Japanese
industry in the 1980s, but was widely abandoned in the recent downturn.
Takizawa justifies sticking to the old invest-or-die approach on the grounds
that the company has few foreign competitors, operating with the advantage
of cheaper local currencies. This allows him to market more on quality than
on price.
Takizawa admits, however, there is nothing they can do if the Japanese
market continues to shrink. His clients, he says, hold his business hostage.
'We only supply a small part of a big machine,' says Takizawa.
Meisei Metal is slightly higher up the feudal ladder than Takizawa, yet it
is even more vulnerable because its top three buyers account for 85 per cent
of sales.
It has had to accept price cuts of up to 30 per cent this year, and as a
result it made a loss of Y100m in the first six months of the year - its
first of the recession. The loss would have been larger if Meisei had not
turned away demands for 50 per cent price cuts from some buyers, says Ueda.
Like Takizawa, Meisei has few direct foreign competitors. But given the
domestic overcapacity in Japanese die-making, Meisei has had to find a way
of making itself more attractive than Japanese rivals. 'We believe
co-operative manufacturing is the key,' says Ueda.
He is referring to the formation two years ago of a joint company by Meisei
and three other subcontractors to service the needs of a single car company,
which Ueda prefers not to name.
The subcontracting group, called Must - after the initial letters of its
members - pools design, marketing and finance to save costs.
It also saves costs for the customer by reducing the number of suppliers the
buyer has to handle. Several of Meisei's competitors have adopted the same
strategy and the company may launch Must-type groups for other buyers.
Showa Plastics, while much bigger than Meisei and Takizawa, is more
sensitive to foreign competition because its products go straight to
assembly plants, where its consumer electronics industry patrons have led
the way in establishing low-cost operations in Europe and eastern Asia.
Showa, another member of Matsushita's co-prosperity pyramid, has shifted 60
per cent of its Y20bn turnover out of Japan, mainly into neighbouring Asian
countries, since the early 1980s.
It has been helped by the natural preference of its Japanese customers'
overseas subsidiaries to take a Japanese supplier, says Nakagawa, who is a
keen advocate of the borderless economy propounded by his fellow Osaka
resident Kenichi Ohmae. Where possible, he has used local funding and local
staff, so that nearly half of Showa's employees are now Chinese speakers.
In the past five years, Showa has closed four of its eight Japanese plants
and reduced its domestic workforce from 550 to 150.
This is unusually aggressive restructuring by the standards of Showa's
Japanese competitors, who pride themselves on not cutting jobs. 'We were
lucky, because 60 per cent of our Japanese workers were part-time, so we
just didn't renew their contracts. They easily transferred to other jobs,
mostly on higher pay. But we can't restructure on that scale again,' says
Nakagawa.
Showa's rapid foreign expansion has helped it to broaden its client base, so
that the top three now account for 40 per cent of sales, from 75 per cent in
the mid-1980s. But the most important benefit of moving production out of
Japan is, as its customers have found, to protect Showa from the yen's
inexorable rise, the main factor in the price pressure on Japan's
subcontractors.
Showa's prices have fallen by 30 per cent during the past four years.
Overall unit costs have also fallen, helped by the decline in foreign
currencies against the yen, far enough to allow Showa to increase its
profits throughout the downturn.
Many of Japan's subcontractors followed their big clients into the US and
Europe in the 1980s - indeed, Showa has a plant in the UK.
A second wave of suppliers is now moving into Asia, leaving their domestic
counterparts to struggle for market share in a Japanese economy that is
unlikely to return to the heady growth rates of the 1980s in this decade.

FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Economy: Blair signals strategy shift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, yesterday revealed a subtle but
significant shift in his party's strategy by avoiding the traditional reflex
condemnation of any rise in interest rates.
His reaction to the rise in base rates - spelt out in an article in today's
Financial Times - contrasted sharply with the more familiar attacks from
union leaders
Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, said Mr Kenneth Clarke was
exaggerating the inflationary pressures in the economy. Mr Alan Jinkinson,
general secretary of Unison, the public-sector union, called the move
disastrous.
But in the latest of a series of policy switches designed to mark out a
distinctive leadership style, Mr Blair avoided direct criticism of the
judgment made by Mr Kenneth Clarke and Mr Eddie George that action was
needed to head off a resurgence of inflation.
Instead of the more traditional 'soundbite' attack on any rise in borrowing
costs, the Labour leader focused his attack on the government's broader
economic management by stressing the underlying weakness of the economy
which had prompted the risk of higher inflation.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, took up the same theme,
describing the move as the price Britain had to pay for consistent
under-investment in the economy.
Writing in the FT, Mr Blair says that businesses and households have good
reason to feel worried by a rise in borrowing costs when the economy is
barely out of recession. But he stresses that the real political debate
should not be about whether a particular rise in interest rates was
justified. What counts is what the increase reveals about the long-term
weaknesses of the British economy.
It was a matter of 'acute economic judgment' whether the rise in interest
rates could have been postponed.
Mr Blair's decision to focus on the long-term problems facing the economy
rather than on more immediate point-scoring is designed to reinforce the
approach flagged earlier this year by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow
chancellor.
But it will further anger those on the left of the Labour party who believe
that the new party leader has been too ready to embrace fiscal and monetary
conservatism.
Reaction to the rise on the Tory back benches was relatively subdued. Some
said Mr Clarke had given in too easily to Bank pressures while others shared
the judgment of Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, that he had been
wise to act now rather than be forced into a larger increase later in the
year.

FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Economy: Chancellor and Treasury detail reasons for
1/2-point rise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The following statement was issued yesterday by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor:
After discussion with the governor of the Bank of England, I have decided to
increase interest rates by  1/2 per cent to ensure that, in the conditions
of strong economic growth that we are now experiencing, we take no risks
with inflation.
It is because the growth of our economy is becoming so strong so quickly
that I have made this move now. Output is growing at its fastest rate for
six years. Exports are at record levels and export volumes continue to grow.
Investment is rising, especially in manufacturing.
My overriding aim now is to make sure that this healthy growth can be
sustained to deliver higher living standards and more jobs. So often in the
past, accelerating inflation has prevented us from enjoying sustained
growth. I am determined this will not happen again.
Underlying inflation is currently 2.2 per cent, the lowest level for 27
years. To make sure it stays that way we need to act in good time to prevent
inflationary pressures taking hold - especially since changes in interest
rates affect inflation only after a considerable lag.
We are now enjoying accelerating growth with low inflation. This is a
healthy recovery and today's move will help to keep it healthy and lasting.
Permanently low inflation is the only way to deliver permanently rising
living standards.
The Treasury set out its detailed reasons for the rise:
Inflation is currently very low:
Underlying retail price inflation in July was 2.2 per cent, in the lower
half of the government's target range. In recent months some indicators have
suggested that cost and price pressures may start to pick up.
Sterling commodity prices are 10 per cent higher than a year ago, and this
is starting to be reflected in manufacturers' input prices which have risen
over the last year by around 3 per cent.
Recent CBI surveys have shown an increasing proportion of companies
expecting to raise their prices.
The main monetary indicators are mixed:
M4 growth is within its monitoring range and house prices are fairly stable
but the exchange rate has fallen slightly and M0 growth has been above its
0-4 per cent monitoring range since early 1993. Although in part this
reflects the expected result of previous interest rate reductions, the
persistence of M0 growth above its range is a cause for concern.
Activity has been strengthening since the beginning of the year:
The latest GDP figures show annual growth of 3.7 per cent (3.0 per cent
excluding oil). Revisions to GDP growth also mean that the level of GDP is
now over  1/2 percentage point higher than earlier estimates, and the level
of spare capacity has fallen. Manufacturing output expectations in the
August CBI Survey rose to their highest level since September 1988, pointing
to a further acceleration of output in the months ahead; and the CBI's
measure of capacity utilisation is now above its average level.
Activity in the major overseas economies has also continued to strengthen
somewhat faster than expected.
Against this background of a strong economy the chancellor is determined to
take no risks with inflation.

FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Economy: Factory-gate price growth is higher than
expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The price of goods leaving factory gates rose in most manufacturing sectors
last month, providing one of the first indications that companies have
started to pass the recent rises in the cost of raw materials to their
customers.
The Central Statistical Office yesterday said that output prices rose by 0.3
per cent in August compared with July - its biggest monthly increase for
four months.
Measured without the volatile food, drink, tobacco and petroleum sectors,
output prices rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.4 per cent, month on month,
and by 2.1 per cent in the year to August.
The rise was larger than City forecasts. It follows several months in which
output prices were relatively flat, although raw-material costs have been
rising steadily, fuelled by commodity price increases.
Since the start of the year input prices have risen by slightly more than 6
per cent, while output prices have risen by only 1.2 per cent.
Although most analysts have been predicting that commodity price increases
would eventually feed through to output prices, many had suspected that
companies would not be able to make price rises stick in the face of strong
customer resistance.
Mr Adrian Cooper, UK economist at brokers James Capel said: 'These figures
are obviously disappointing. You can't read too much into monthly figures
but they are the first sign that manufacturers are able to make price
increases stick and commodity price rises are feeding through.'
The rise in output prices was particularly noteworthy, analysts added,
because the pace of the rise in input prices had actually slowed in August.
The cost of raw materials and fuel purchased by the manufacturing sector
rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.4 per cent between July and August, and by
3.4 per cent in the year to August. This was considerably lower than earlier
this year, when input prices rose by 1.4 per cent, month on month, in June
and 0.6 per cent in July.
Without seasonal adjustment, input prices fell 0.6 per cent between July and
August, partly due to a seasonal fall in home-produced food manufacturing
input prices.
Another factor which reduced the seasonally adjusted input prices was a 0.9
per cent drop in fuel prices between July and August, and a 4 per cent fall
in crude oil prices. These falls were partly offset by rises in the price of
chemical inputs, imported food products and other imported goods. However,
the cost of metals also fell by 0.6 per cent in August compared with July,
reversing the pattern seen in recent months when rising commodity prices
have affected some metals sectors.
On the output side, the rise in prices was spread fairly evenly across most
sectors. The petroleum sector saw the fastest rise, with prices up 1.9 per
cent between July and August. The textile sector also saw a significant rise
of 0.7 per cent in the month.
Prices in the basic metals, chemicals and transport sectors rose by slightly
over 0.5 per cent, while rubber and plastics, pulp, paper and publishing
goods grew by 0.45 per cent.
The only price fall was in the wood and wood-products sector. The cost of
goods produced by food manufacturers, electrical and optical equipment
factories and other machinery sectors were flat.

FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Economy: Lift in rates increases Clarke's City stock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's personal stock among City analysts was one of
the clearest beneficiaries of yesterday's surprise base-rate rise. The
decision wrong-footed most of the market and provoked squeals from business
and industry but has lent credibility in the City to the government's
low-inflation creed.
Part of the reason for the favourable reception lies in the underlying
economics. With output growing fast and yesterday's producer price data
providing one of the first hints that inflationary pressures may be in the
pipeline, the government's argument that base rates must rise soon to avert
inflation has already been widely accepted in the City.
But the real reason for the positive verdict was more political than
statistical. In deciding to raise rates ahead of the Conservative party
conference, while most economic indicators suggest that consumer confidence
is fragile, Mr Clarke yesterday went part of the way towards convincing the
City that it is now economic factors, rather than short-term politics, that
are determining the timing of interest-rate rises.
Mr Geoffrey Dicks, UK economist with Natwest Markets said: 'It is a bold
move for the chancellor to go to the party conference with rates having
risen - indeed, to raise rates with inflation this low is probably
unprecedented.'
Mr David Mackie, UK economist at JP Morgan, said: 'To my mind this can only
improve the chancellor's reputation. This move suggests that although Norman
Lamont (the previous chancellor) outlined the inflation target as being 1
per cent to 4 per cent, the Bank of England and chancellor are now really
aiming for 1 per cent to 2.5 per cent.'
However, the verdict on the new system of monthly monetary meetings between
Mr Clarke and Mr Eddie George, the Bank governor, remains more mixed.
On the one hand, many analysts believe the greater openness leaves the Bank
with much of the credit for the rate rise. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief
economist in London at the Bank of America, said that the clear message of
yesterday's move is that the Bank 'has much more independence in setting
monetary policy than it has had in its history'.
On the other hand, the logistics of the move has prompted complaints that
the Bank's method for announcing a rise is unnecessarily opaque. The
complaints may partly reflect red faces in the City. After Bank money-market
operations last week - widely interpreted as confirming that interest rates
were unchanged - most economists were confident a rise had been postponed.
For some economists this pointed to an underlying weakness in the system.
One such was Mr Gavyn Davies, chief economist of Goldman Sachs who, like
many, predicted no rate change. He said: 'The fact that the decision was
delayed until Friday means that it is not being taken in the monetary
meeting and that is less credibility enhancing.'
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank, agreed. 'I don't see the
point of trying to catch the markets out,' he said.
Others say it highlights a broader change. Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist
with Salomon Brothers, said: 'The market has learnt that the process of
deciding a rate rise is not black and white . . . but from Mr Clarke's point
of view it helps to dampen the notion that interest-rate policy is still
politically driven.'

FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Economy: Industry disappointed but markets give thumbs-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, PHILIP GAWITH and ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Industry was yesterday united in expressing disappointment at the rise in
interest rates but views were mixed on whether it would have any material
impact on the recovery.
However, the markets gave a thumbs-up to the rise, with gilts and sterling
making sharp gains. The FT-SE 100 index finished 10.5 points down on the day
at 3128.8, but sentiment was generally positive.
Among the more strident critics of yesterday's decision was the British
Chambers of Commerce, which said the move could 'sabotage the recovery'. Mr
Richard Brown, deputy director, said it was premature and would have a
harmful effect on business and consumer confidence. 'Consumer demand is
fragile and capacity utilisation is low. This rise means companies'
profitability will be further eroded and there is a danger that some
companies could fold.'
Mr Tim Melville-Ross, director-general of the Institute of Directors, said
his members would be 'surprised and disappointed' as inflationary influences
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
described the move as 'unusual, since there is no strong market pressure for
an upward rise in rates'.
He continued: 'We had expected a small rise before the end of the year,
though in our judgment it would have been safe to wait a little longer since
inflationary pressures remain weak, as does the housing market.'
He added: 'This move, in itself, is unlikely to damage the healthy recovery
we are now seeing. But we would not like at this stage to see rates rise
much further.'
Mr Graham Mackenzie, director-general of the Engineering Employers
Federation, said: 'We are disappointed, especially in light of
better-than-expected trends in inflation. Low inflation is important, but
not at the risk of stifling the recovery.'
In the markets, analysts expressed mixed views about the implications for
sterling. Some thought it would benefit from the fact that the Bank of
England was clearly playing a greater role in monetary policy. The
willingness of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to take a difficult
decision was also seen as positive.
Others were more wary. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in
London, commented: 'I still think it's going nowhere fast. The rate rise
might give it some support, but it is still caught in the crossfire of the
big currencies.'
The gilt market was less ambiguous, helped by Mr Clarke's pledge to avoid
early tax cuts. 'The gilt market loved it, especially given the firm
comments on tax,' said Mr Simon Briscoe at SG Warburg.
He added: 'There had been some uncertainty about policy here and the market
finds this very reassuring. I would be surprised if the market didn't move
ahead in the next few days.'

FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Economy: Mortgage lenders prepare to follow suit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The announcements yesterday of rises in variable mortgage rates by
Nationwide Building Society and Abbey National seem certain to be the first
in a wave of statements from lenders over the next couple of weeks.
Northern Rock Building Society, the 11th largest, said it would be raising
rates from 7.74 per cent - probably to 8.10 per cent to 8.14 per cent. Most
if not all of that would also be passed on to savers.
National &amp; Provincial Building Society, the UK's eighth largest society, is
expected to announce new rates today. Other lenders, including Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester Building Society, the sixth largest, and Britannia Building
Society, the ninth largest, are expected to announce new rates next week.
Many high street banks are also waiting until they see what Halifax Building
Society, the UK's largest mortgage lender, says within the week.
But Barclays Bank announced increases in the range of 0.25 per cent to 0.75
per cent for some savings accounts. From today the start rate for the 90-day
savings account rises to 4.75 per cent gross. The bank's mortgage rates are
under review. Yorkshire Bank also increased some savings rates.
Alongside its 0.4 percentage point increase, taking the basic variable rate
to 8.14 per cent, Nationwide announced some increases - of up to 0.5
percentage points - in certain rates available in its CashBuilder instant
access account.
Abbey National said its 0.35 percentage point increase from early October
would mean a standard variable rate of 8.09 per cent for mortgages below
Pounds 60,000 and of less than 8 per cent for larger mortgages.
However, the rate rise is seen as an encouraging sign of the government's
determination to keep inflation down and this could lead to slightly lower
rates on longer-term fixed-rate mortgages, for which funds are raised on the
wholesale money markets.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Labour conference set for row over Irish unity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour is heading for a row at its annual conference this month over the
future of its 13-year-old commitment to campaign for Irish unity by consent.
The row threatens the future of Mr Kevin McNamara, shadow Northern Ireland
secretary, whose attachment to Irish nationalism is regarded as out of date
by party leaders.
The unity-by-consent policy - adopted in 1981 after a split over the Troops
Out movement - has been under severe strain since the IRA announced an
open-ended ceasefire last month.
Mr Tony Blair, the party leader, believes that Labour's commitment to
persuade Ulster unionists to agree to a united Ireland is outdated and could
damage the prospects for a permanent peace.
Mr Blair is believed to favour a move towards neutrality, which would allow
Labour to support Northern Ireland's right to remain in the UK for as long
as a majority of the population wished to.
However, Labour's conference agenda contains only hardline nationalist
resolutions, most of which reject any solution which would not guarantee a
united Ireland.
Such a resolution would be embarrassing to Mr Blair, who is said to be
determined to remove control of Irish policy from the party's nationalist
wing.
As a result, the leadership is likely to back one of several less
nationalist proposals being circulated by more moderate party pressure
groups, which could be tabled as emergency resolutions in Blackpool.
One potential compromise has been put forward by Independent Labour
Publications, a pressure group, which calls for a full policy review by the
ruling national executive committee.
The resolution calls on the NEC to report to the 1995 conference, giving Mr
Blair room to manoeuvre in response to developments in the UK-Irish peace
process.
A growing number of Labour MPs believe that Mr Mc-Namara could not credibly
present a more neutral policy because of his longstanding commitment to
Irish unity.
Mr McNamara is also deeply unpopular with unionist MPs who were angered by
proposals for joint UK-Irish sovereignty over Northern Ireland put forward
by his office last year.
Mr Blair has recently sought closer relations with the Ulster Unionist
party, and has had some success in persuading it that Labour intends to
modernise its Irish policy.
Mr McNamara has had little to say about the ceasefire, and there have been
repeated rumours in Labour circles that he has been told to refrain from
commenting by the leadership.
Tribune, the leftwing weekly, reported in its latest issue that Mr McNamara
was barred from giving an interview to the BBC by Labour party headquarters.
Mr Blair would have little difficulty in removing Mr McNamara from the
shadow cabinet because he is a co-opted member rather than an elected one.
However, no changes are likely until after the annual shadow cabinet
elections in November.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Upturn 'bringing workplace unrest'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than one in five of Britain's largest unionised companies have
experienced industrial unrest during the past 12 months, according to a
survey published yesterday by Dibb Lupton Broomhead, a firm of solicitors
specialising in employment law.
The survey of disputes, based on replies from about 100 unionised companies
among the top 500 UK companies, found that 22 per cent had experienced
industrial unrest in the past year and that 16.7 per cent expected unrest in
the next 12 months. Most of the cases were in the north of England's
manufacturing sector.
'Our survey suggests that there is considerably more industrial tension
bubbling beneath the surface than the simple 'days lost' government
statistics showing that in 1992 just over 0.5m working days were lost as
against 29m working days lost in 1979,' said DLB.,
Mr Paul Nicholls, lead employment partner, said recovery seemed to be
bringing back industrial unrest but was partly disguised by the fact that it
took forms other than the all-out withdrawal of labour.
'Employees are not yet sufficiently confident to forgo the whole of their
pay to support their claims and union coffers post-recession are not able to
meet strike pay liabilities,' said the firm. Employers' greater readiness to
use the law was another factor in restraining traditional industrial action.
The union-funded Labour Research Department found recently that there have
been 189 legal cases brought by employers against unions since 1985, most of
them in the form of injunctions over balloting or picketing.
The DLB survey said: 'As many as 95.6 per cent of employers said the option
of using legal action in disputes gave them a powerful bargaining weapon. As
many as 88.8 per cent of employers said they would be prepared to take
action against individual strikers by dismissing them.'
However, some union officials said privately that some of the legal changes
of the past decade had also helped to increase union leverage in the process
of industrial conflict. 'Strike ballots are often a very useful extra
pressure on employers,' said one official.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Clash on council reforms grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Local Government Commission yesterday intensified its opposition to the
government over local authority reform by proposing that the two-tier system
of districts and counties should remain unchanged in Gloucestershire.
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, rejected this proposal when it
was first made, and said he would prefer to create new unitary all-purpose
authorities, which combine the functions of districts and counties.
But the commission, chaired by Sir John Banham, said it had found 'no
substantial new evidence' to alter its views. It had received only 111
submissions since the second review for the county was announced, 'many of
which repeated earlier representations'.
Sir John had already retained his proposals to keep the status quo in Durham
and Derbyshire, the other two counties where Mr Gummer called for a further
review.
The commission now seems likely to leave the two-tier status quo intact in
most of England. It has attempted to strengthen its opposition to the
government's agenda by holding 'advisory referenda' - as Sir John describes
them - in which all households in the counties concerned have been sent a
leaflet laying out a range of options.
Sir John made clear when announcing the first referendum, in Leicestershire,
that the commission would not recommend change if it was not strongly
supported. 'If there is not a clear message, our duty is to recommend no
change,' he said. 'We are not in the business of changing for its own sake -
nor is parliament.'
Results from Leicestershire, published yesterday, showed that only 2.3 per
cent of residents returned leaflets to the commission. Of these, 35 per cent
supported the commission's favoured option, which would give unitary status
to Leicester and Rutland while leaving two tiers for the rest of the county
untouched. At the same time 34 per cent expressed a preference for the
status quo, even though this was not an option formally presented by the
commission.
However, 60 per cent of Rutland residents who responded supported unitary
status for their district, which was an independent county until the last
local government reorganisation in 1974. Results for 11 more counties will
follow in the next few weeks.
Under the legislation which set up the review, the government has the power
to reject Sir John's recommendations, but it cannot order a change in
structure unless it has first been proposed by the commission.
This means the commission can block a unitary structure in England, even
though such systems have already been imposed on Wales and Scotland.
The commission has now made provisional recommendations for all the 39
counties in shire England. In 14 its preferred option is the status quo,
while in another 13 it has proposed unitary options while presenting the
status quo as an option.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Howard accused on jail rule change
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Home Office told Whitemoor Prison, Cambridgeshire, not to body-search
visitors to IRA prisoners, the founder chairman of Whitemoor's Board of
Visitors claims today and she calls for the resignation of Mr Michael
Howard, the home secretary.
At the end of last week a prison guard at Whitemoor was shot when five
convicted IRA terrorists and an armed robber attempted to escape.
In letters published in several newspapers today Mrs Paddy Seligman says:
'The decision not to body-search visitors to IRA prisoners was made not
locally by management but at Home Office level. The implications resulting
from this decision are now obvious. If the resignation of anyone is called
for, it should be that of the home secretary.'
Mrs Seligman, who was a member of the board of visitors until March, said
the board had expressed concern about 'excessive privileges' given to
prisoners in dispersal prisons. 'Coupled with our concern about the sparsity
of searching of visitors to prisoners due to staffing level restrictions,
security is inevitably compromised.'
She says that custodial sentences must be available to protect the public in
certain cases but they are an expensive option which must be adequately
funded. Treasury economies must not preclude the protection of the public
and prison staff.
The escape attempt, after which two firearms were recovered, led to claims
by Ulster unionists that the IRA's ceasefire had broken down. However the
government made clear that it would have no effect on the peace process.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Ministers urged to maintain union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A list of motions submitted for debate at next month's Conservative party
conference in Bournemouth shows that activists are dissatisfied with a range
of government policies, including the peace initiative in Northern Ireland,
the party's internal organisation and the treatment of local councils.
The motions - only a handful of which have been selected for debate - reveal
that grassroots activists who are traditionally loyal to Mr John Major's
leadership have become angry as the party's popularity has slumped.
On Northern Ireland, nearly all 50 motions submitted warn ministers not to
surrender sovereignty over Ulster and to maintain the union.
All the motions were submitted before the IRA ceasefire at the end of last
month. But one calls for the Anglo-Irish agreement to be scrapped and
suggests that the prospect of negotiations with Sinn Fein will dismay some
delegates.
There is also concern about policy on local government following the Tories'
disastrous performance in the council elections in May. Many local
associations call for an end to the capping of council expenditure and for
the government to reverse its decision to set up unitary local authorities.
On Europe, nearly all the motions endorse the scepticism towards the
European Union which the prime minister expressed during the Euro-election
campaign.
In many cases the government is urged to hold a referendum on Britain's
future in Europe amid signs that - as one association puts it - 'too much is
being done too fast on European integration'.
Party managers remain confident of a good conference next month. They argue
that delegates will rally round government policies on fighting crime and
controlling public spending. As usual, the leadership has selected a series
of uncontroversial motions to anchor the main debates.
However, one minister warned yesterday that there was much discontent among
the party rank-and-file over the way Tory MPs had conducted themselves over
the past 12 months. 'There is a lot of pressure, not on the government but
on the party as a whole, to be more cohesive and not to argue in public.'

More than 100 companies are expected to be represented at a trade fair at
the end of September in Newry, Co Down. The fair, organised by chambers of
commerce in Northern Ireland and the Irish republic, is aimed at encouraging
business contacts between north and south.
It also aims to help companies grasp the opportunities which will develop
against the background of a lasting IRA ceasefire.
Mr John Stringer, director of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce,
said: 'The timing is particularly important. There could hardly be a better
time for a very practical initiative such as this.'
It will be the largest conference of its kind organised by the chamber of
commerce movement in Ireland.
The chamber is also due to represent Northern Ireland companies at an
exhibition in Dublin next month.

FT  13 SEP 94 / IRA tune fails to slow tempo of City beat: The Square Mile's
tough-minded new police chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The IRA ceasefire is unlikely to mean a relaxation in the near future of
tough security measures introduced to protect the City after last year's
bomb attack, according to the City's new police commissioner, Mr William
Taylor.
In his first interview since his appointment in April, Mr Taylor underlined
the dangers of rushing to ease counter-terrorist measures which include
high-profile policing, roadblocks, a restrictive traffic scheme and
increasing video surveillance.
'This is a time for politicians to be talking. The business of policing will
come later. At this stage law enforcement should not be getting ahead of the
political situation,' he said.
Mr Taylor refused to be drawn on the political situation in Northern
Ireland, but said he felt 'entirely satisfied' that the continuing security
measures were 'proportionate' to the perceived threat.
Mr Taylor's views are thought to reflect the cautious attitude within the
security forces to the IRA ceasefire. It is understood that security
assessments of IRA intentions remain confused.
As well as being responsible for an area covering many potential terrorist
targets, Mr Taylor chairs the Association of Chief Police Officers' crime
committee and is the association's adviser on terrorism.
Mr Taylor, speaking at the City force's headquarters in Old Jewry, was
anxious that complacency in some political quarters about the intentions of
the IRA should not undermine the City's improved security, which has
involved increased co-operation between police and business. 'Crime of all
sorts in the City has tumbled and that is a consequence of a very real
partnership between police and the business community.'
The crime rate in the City fell 10 per cent last year and a further 17 per
cent in the first quarter of this year according to police figures.
Mr Taylor conceded that efforts to arrest and bring to trial those
responsible for last year's IRA Bishopsgate bomb attack had so far failed
because of lack of sufficient evidence.
But he claimed the fight against terrorism had become more efficient over
the past five years, with growing co-operation between regional police
forces and acceptance of the primacy of MI5, the security agency, in
intelligence-gathering. 'There is now a willingness to follow a lead in a
way that perhaps has been absent in the past.'
He spoke of 'a successful level of co-ordination and co-operation' between
police and MI5, but said he was not in favour of the creation of a new
national anti-terrorist unit or the extention of MI5's powers.
'Any suggestion of change has to be looked at very carefully and I would
imagine there would have to be a wide-ranging debate,' he said.
By contrast, Mr Taylor backs reform of the Serious Fraud Office and wants
the police to have a much clearer lead role in investigating financial
crime.
He welcomed the recommendation that the SFO's powers which remove the right
to silence and compel witnesses to answer questions be extended to the
police. At present such powers can only be used by SFO lawyers and
accountants. The recommendation comes from Mr John Graham - a senior
Treasury official who has conducted an inquiry into the SFO on behalf of Sir
Nicholas Lyell QC, the attorney-general.
Mr Taylor said a multi-disciplinary approach was necessary in some very big
fraud cases, but there was a need to re-examine the relationship between
police, lawyers and accountants 'so that we are not all fishing out of the
same pool'.
Echoing the tensions between police and non-police personnel in the SFO over
the management of investigations, Mr Taylor said: 'Investigation and
prosecution of fraud has been rather more successful than has sometimes been
portrayed but we have to deal with people's negative perceptions.  The key
is to harness people's skills to the best advantage and I think we should be
leading the investigations.'
Mr Taylor, 47, is widely regarded as one of the brightest and most
opinionated of police chiefs.
Although his area of London has not been marked out by the prime minister
for his attacks on the nation's 'yob culture', Mr Taylor insisted yesterday
on contributing to the debate, claiming that aspects of the criminal-justice
system still favoured the offender at the expense of the victim, and calling
for increased police powers.
He urges more effective use of a national DNA database, and greater
limitations on the right to silence.

FT  13 SEP 94 / CBI hopes for Pounds 350m Ulster peace dividend
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Peace in Northern Ireland could release Pounds 350m a year from the security
budget within five years to help economic development in the province, the
Confederation of British Industry says today.
A report prepared by the CBI Northern Ireland over the past six months and
released two weeks into the IRA ceasefire says a permanent cessation of
violence and a political settlement could have a profound impact on the
local economy.
The CBI calls on the British government to develop a strategy which
maintains existing public-expenditure levels but gradually redirects
spending on law and order into a programme of wealth creation to offset job
losses among security-related activities.
The CBI warns that cuts in expenditure on security could mean substantial
job losses and a sharp reduction in the number of army personnel in the
province. Security spending in the province was almost Pounds 1bn last year,
nearly three times the per-capita level in the rest of Britain. The knock-on
effect could also mean extensive job losses.
But the CBI also estimates that any losses could be offset by the creation
of 29,000 jobs and up to 20,000 vocational training places by 1999. It says,
however, that significantly higher levels of employment growth might be
feasible given a revival of the province's declining manufacturing base.
The report suggests some jobs would come as a result of a rise in inward
investment. In the past 20 years external corporate investors have created
500 jobs a year in Ulster and the CBI says this could now rise within two or
three years to at least 2,000.
Other jobs, it says, should also emerge in the tourism industry, about 3,000
in the short term and up to 10,000 in the longer term.
Any rise in funding for education and training might add another 1,500 jobs
by 1999 and there would also be more in transport infrastructure, housing
improvement and health and environmental services.
Mr Doug Riley, chairman of CBI Northern Ireland, said that Ulster's business
community believed the province was 'entering a new era' which would have to
be built on co-operation.
The CBI says the government will have to develop clear, long-term policies
for public expenditure in full partnership with the private sector if it is
to reinforce the benefits of peace. Maintaining high public spending in the
province will be essential.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Team Lotus seeks help over debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Administrators were called in yesterday by Team Lotus, one of the most
famous British names in motor racing.
The team has run into financial difficulties as the result of a long period
of indifferent on-track performances leaving it with inadequate sponsorship.
A two-car grand prix team requires an operating budget of at least Pounds
10m a year, with front-running teams such as Williams-Renault spending at
least double that.
No details of the extent of the team's indebtedness were being given last
night by the joint administrators, Mr Neil Cooper and Mr Nigel Ruddock of
accountants Robson Rhodes.
There are no connections between Team Lotus and Group Lotus, the sports-car
concern also founded by the late Colin Chapman but now owned by Bugatti of
Italy.
While the administrators have about three months to respond to the team's
creditors, refinancing or the team's sale is expected in the next few weeks.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Call for body to probe Bar complaints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A complaints bureau to investigate allegations of unsatisfactory work by
barristers which could order compensation payments to clients of up to
Pounds 2,000 should be established, the Bar Standards Review Body
recommended yesterday.
The recommendation was one of a number made by the review body, set up by
the Bar Council after last year's royal commission on criminal justice drew
attention to the poor performance of some barristers and called for a
raising of standards.
The complaints bureau, the review body suggests, should be run by a
non-barrister. It should have the power to demand apologies, order
compensation and refer cases to the Bar disciplinary tribunal.
If the Bar agrees to the establishment of such a bureau it could be in
operation by the start of 1996. It would cost about Pounds 167,000 a year to
run, said Lord Alexander of Weedon QC, chairman of the review body.
However, he stressed yesterday that the review body's other recommendations
were aimed at improving the standards of barristers' work so that complaints
were less likely. 'Prevention is still better than cure,' he said.
The other recommendations include pre-trial conferences to improve early
preparation of cases, publication by barristers' chambers of their working
procedures and fees, and the compulsory continuation of education during the
first three years of practice on issues such as case management, time
manage-ment and racial aware-ness.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Farmers attack proposals on nitrate levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Livestock farmers could be forced out of business and overall production
dented by 'ill-conceived' government plans for compulsory restrictions to
cut nitrates in drinking water, the National Farmers' Union said yesterday.
The restrictions hit dairy farmers because the nitrates in the slurry and
manure from their animals leach out from fields into the water supply.
Mr Tony Pexton, NFU vice-president, said proposals for 72
'nitrate-vulnerable zones' covering 650,000 hectares in England and Wales
were based on arbitrary figures for maximum nitrate levels.
The government has proposed that the zones take effect by the end of 1999 to
comply with the European Commission's 1991 nitrate directive. This says that
nitrates in drinking water sources should not exceed 50mg per litre on any
single occasion.
Mr Pexton said this was over-rigorous because the World Health Organisation
and the government's Department of Health suggested a limit of 50mg per
litre as an average over a year, as opposed to a 50mg limit on any one
occasion. He said the UK's limit of 100mg per litre had 'no perceivable
effect on health'.
The commission is reviewing the 50mg limit. The NFU urged the government not
to begin implementing the policy until the review was complete.
Mr Pexton accused the National Rivers Authority of a series of errors in
drawing up the zones, which are mainly in East Anglia, the Midlands and the
north-east.
Up to half the land in some zones had been incorrectly defined, water
samples had not been taken often enough and they had produced widely
different results, he said.
Livestock farmers in the zones would be restricted in the timing and amount
of their applications of organic man-ure, with no compensation.
Mr Pexton said the NFU had received letters from livestock farmers who said
they could be forced out of business by the restrictions. Among the
estimated 10,000 farmers affected, the worst hit could be small dairy
producers who would be forced to run down their herds to uneconomic levels.
Land values could be affected.
He also cited a report by the US Department of Agriculture which said
'proper implementation of the directive will result in very significant
falls in output for some livestock products'. In the case of pigs and
poultry, this could turn the European Union from a net exporter to a net
importer.

The Russians have been pouring cold water on Salisbury Plain with a
demonstration of a giant water bomber aircraft designed to combat the
growing scourge of forest fires, Paul Betts writes.
The demonstration of the Ilyushin IL-76, capable of carrying more than 40
tonnes of payload, was staged for the US Forest Service. The service is
interested in strengthening its fire fighting resources after the
devastating Californian fires last year.
The IL-76 is normally used for military transport and civil cargo.
Variants of the aircraft have also been built as aerial tankers for
refuelling military aircraft and as flying radar stations.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Swans designers win a reprieve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership, was given a last
chance of survival yesterday when Price Waterhouse, the receivers, postponed
making the yard's design team redundant, Chris Tighe writes.
The remaining 103 team members were reprieved after more than two hours of
hard negotiation between the receivers and union officials.
Loss of the design team would have made it impossible for Swan Hunter to
tender for more work, in effect ensuring its demise by ending prospects of
its sale as a going concern.
Nearly all the 103 will now go on September 30 unless, against great odds, a
going-concern sale can be finalised.
The decision to defer the redundancies will mean an additional wage bill of
about Pounds 100,000.
Previous deadlines of August 31 and September 9 were waived because of
proposals, since withdrawn, for bids from Constructions Mecaniques de
Normandie.

FT  13 SEP 94 / BR freight revenue hit by dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The signal workers' strikes are causing more problems for British Rail than
for its industrial customers, many of which have found alternative ways to
transport bulk materials, it emerged yesterday.
But the stoppages are damaging customer confidence in rail as an alternative
to road transport at a time when the opening of the Channel tunnel should
provide positive images of rail transport.
'Freight customers are questioning whether they should continue to give
their business to the railways when we cannot deliver,' Mr John Welsby, BR
chief executive, says in the latest edition of Railnews, the staff
newspaper.
Mr Welsby put the weekly loss of freight revenues at Pounds 1m and said BR
had lost freight contracts worth a total of Pounds 3m.
BR estimated that it had been able to run only 10 per cent of trains
carrying bulk freight in the north-east of England on strike days and only
60 per cent in the south-east. Railfreight Distribution, which moves
container trains from the ports to inland terminals, had moved only 20 per
cent of its normal volumes.
Trainload Freight North East said the strikes were costing it Pounds 200,000
a day in extra overtime and other expenses, but the most serious damage was
being done to rail's reputation in the longer term.
Railfreight Distribution said it had been unable to develop Channel tunnel
business as it had hoped.
Bell Lines, a shipping company, said it was unable to make long-term
commitments to customers about its Channel tunnel service.
British Steel described the strikes as 'an inconvenience' but said it had
moved much of its transport to road after the 1984 miners' strike.
But ARC, the aggregates company, said difficulties in moving shipments from
its Mendips quarries to depots in the south-east meant some depots had
almost run out.
Meanwhile, on the eve of the next two consecutive days of disruption,
Railtrack again warned signal workers that they faced losing up to Pounds
1,700 a year of their pension entitlements from September 30 if agreement on
restructuring had not been reached.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Mercury charges for 'free' mobile phone calls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercury One-2-One, the mobile-telephone company that markets itself on its
offer of free local calls, has been charging customers for calls made in
'free' periods.
Oftel, the telecommunications watchdog, said it had received nearly 50
complaints from One-2-One customers who were aggrieved at charges for local
calls made in the evenings and at weekends when they are supposed to be
free.
'This is a significant number of complaints about a single issue, and we are
looking into it,' Oftel said.
The complaints concern One-2-One's incorrect billing and the company's
failure to guarantee compensation to users affected by it.
Mercury One-2-One said there was a 'problem' of incorrect charges for a
'minute proportion' of calls made in free periods. It said the charges were
caused by the 'vagaries of a radio-based system' when relating to the
standard call zones of British Telecommunications.
The company normally reimburses customers only when they complain for the
first time. 'We explain to them why this happens, and that in some cases
they also gain from the vagaries,' it said. It added that it had no plans to
change its policy of not reimbursing customers for subsequent complaints.
Mercury One-2-One, which was launched a year ago, covers a large part of the
south-east. The company trades heavily on lower prices as compensation for
narrower geographical coverage than the rival cellular networks operated by
Vodafone, Cellnet and Orange. It has about 130,000 subscribers out of a UK
cellular market of about 2.7m.
BT, the target of much of One-2-One's promotion, has begun attacking
One-2-One claims to be price-competitive with the fixed network.
Last week it dismissed as 'nonsense' claims that One-2-One's latest tariff
package for daytime business users calling from a single 'cell' worked out
cheaper than BT, once fixed rental and handset costs were taken into
account.
However, One-2-One appears to be significantly more successful than Orange,
which was launched in April. According to the FT's Mobile Communications
newsletter, One-2-One signed up 17,500 net new subscribers in August,
compared with only 6,000 for Orange, which has wider coverage.
Orange disputed the figures, but declined yesterday to release any of its
own.
The number of mobile-phone subscribers is growing at an annual rate of about
50 per cent and the two new operators are creating competition in the
market. However, they are anxious to avoid an all-out price war, which would
erode margins.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Remploy staff vote for strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unionised employees of Remploy, which was set up in 1945 to give work to
disabled people, have voted by a large majority for strike action over pay
for the first time in the company's history.
Remploy, which employs about 8,000 workers making army uniforms, furniture
and electrical goods, receives an Pounds 80m-plus annual government subsidy.
It was recently at the centre of an argument about the compatibility of its
status as a priority government supplier with European Union subsidy rules.
Mr Michael Portillo, employment secretary, ruled that the priority status
was contrary to European rules, but the European Commission has suggested
that companies employing disabled people are exempt.
A meeting on the issue held in Brussels yesterday had to be cancelled
because Mr Portillo is unwell.
The GMB general union, which represents about 4,000 of the 6,000 unionised
workers, said yesterday that more than 70 per cent of its members had voted
for strike action on a turnout of nearly 80 per cent.
The other unions are expected to report majorities in favour of action today
when all the unions meet. Industrial action could not begin before September
23.
The unions argue that a tougher management style emphasising efficiency
rather than welfare, introduced two years ago, is driving out the most
severely disabled workers.
Mr Phil Davies, GMB national officer, said this style was exemplified by a
new productivity scheme requiring workers to be able to work at least 40
minutes per hour rather than the present 28 minutes.
The union says that the company is making payment of a 2.5 per cent increase
on basic pay dependent on acceptance of the new productivity scheme and more
flexible working. The company says that it simply wants to talk about
productivity.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Walker denies 'bogus' film deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brent Walker's film division was never involved in bogus transactions, Mr
George Walker, the former chairman and chief executive of the property and
leisure company, said at the Old Bailey yesterday.
Beginning his second week in the witness box, Mr Walker strongly denied
prosecution allegations that he had helped inflate Brent Walker's profits by
illegally removing money from the company and then falsely declaring it as
income from sales of film rights.
Mr Walker and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, a former Brent Walker finance director,
both deny charges of theft, false accounting and conspiracy to falsify
accounts.
Cross-examined by Mr Peter Rook QC, Mr Walker agreed that until 1989, Brent
Walker had successively reported increased profits. However, he denied Mr
Rook's suggestion that, had the film division's accounts been properly
reported, this would have had a 'devastating effect'.
'If I had dropped dead, it would have had a devastating effect,' Mr Walker
replied.
Mr Rook then suggested that the reason some staff in the film division had
never heard of some of the transactions involving Universal Talent
Management, a company run by Mr John Quested, the managing director of the
film division, was because they were bogus. Mr Walker said the auditors
would have spotted bogus transactions.
Mr Walker did agree that he had signed documents related to some of the
transactions but denied he had detailed knowledge of the deals. He largely
relied upon Mr Quested to handle them, he said.
The trial continues today.

The site of British Steel's Ravenscraig complex at Motherwell in Lanarkshire
is intended to become an urban village built around an 80-acre lake,
according to a redevelopment plan announced yesterday.
The 1,000-acre site will be decontaminated and reclaimed at the cost of
about Pounds 30m in public money. The plan envisages private-sector
investment of Pounds 200m over 25 years to develop 350 acres of the site.
The urban village would include housing, shops, offices, leisure and
business facilities, and possibly a site for further education. Neighbouring
communities will expand to cover the remainder of the site with housing.
Mr Archie Bethel, chief executive of the Lanarkshire Development Agency,
said: 'What we are attempting to do is to replace the missing bit of
Motherwell which would have developed had the steelworks not been there.'
The strategy has been devised by a group involving the Lanarkshire
Development Agency, Scottish Enterprise, British Steel and local
authorities. British Steel expects to start demolition work and
decontamination next year at the plant, which closed in 1992.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Swans receivers reprieve designers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership, was given a last
chance of survival yesterday when Price Waterhouse, the receivers, postponed
making the yard's design team redundant, Chris Tighe writes.
The remaining 103 team members were reprieved after more than two hours of
hard negotiation between the receivers and union officials.
Loss of the design team would have made it impossible for Swan Hunter to
tender for more work, in effect ensuring its demise by ending prospects of
its sale as a going concern.
Nearly all the 103 will now go on September 30 unless, against great odds, a
going-concern sale can be finalised.
Mr Ed James, joint receiver, said: 'It's allowing a little bit more time for
these discussions to progress but not in a real expectation that a
successful conclusion will be reached.' Further redundancies, he warned,
seemed inevitable.
The decision to defer the redundancies means an additional wage bill of
around Pounds 100,000.
Previous deadlines of August 31 and September 9 were waived because of
proposals, since withdrawn, for bids from Constructions Mecaniques de
Normandie.
At a meeting tomorrow with Mr Roger Freeman, the defence procurement
minister, Mr Steve Byers, Labour MP for Wallsend, and Mr Nick Brown, Labour
MP for Newcastle East, will press the government to place design work with
the yard.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Sharp criticises suppliers' pricing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE

<TEXT>
British electronics expertise is increasingly in demand at Sharp, the
Japanese consumer electronics company, but it says that UK electronics
manufacturers are still failing to reach world standards of price and
performance.
Mr Haruo Tsuji, Sharp president, said yesterday that collaboration between
Sharp and UK software specialists on new word-processing systems had proved
so successful that all future software development on the systems would be
carried out in the UK.
However, he said that for many components UK manufacturers were not
competitive. Sharp buys in the UK about 35 per cent of the content of the
microwave ovens, videotape recorders and electronic typewriters it
manufactures at Wrexham, North Wales, but little of this is high-technology
components.
Sharp executives complain they are unable to buy supplies of even simple
components - such as resistors - at a competitive price.
Sharp has even installed metal-forming equipment to make cases for ovens and
video recorders because of a high level of faults experienced with local
components.
Asked if Sharp would help develop a technological infrastructure in the UK
to relieve the problem, Mr Tsuji said Sharp might produce more of the
components in its own factories under its own quality control.
He was in the UK to mark a Pounds 7m investment at the Wrexham plant which
has created 200 new jobs in the area.
It includes a new paint shop and integrated production lines.

FT  13 SEP 94 / ITC to rule on late data service bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Independent Television Commission will decide on Thursday if it should
grant a data broadcasting licence to a News International company in spite
of the application arriving nine minutes after deadline.
Mr Justin Cadbury, chief executive of Simple Active, a company controlled by
the Guardian Media Group, said last night he would consider seeking a
judicial review if the ITC accepts the bid from Skytext.
Mr Cadbury said he was present at ITC just before the noon deadline after
delivering what he thought was the only bid for an additional commercial
service. The licence is for use of spare lines on the ITV picture - but the
service is for only the professional transfer of data and not open for a
general audience.
Mr Cadbury said that at 17 seconds to the noon deadline Mr Anthony Hewitt,
ITC deputy secretary, began a countdown. Fifteen seconds later a message was
passed to Mr Hewitt saying another bid was on the way.
Mr Cadbury said: 'As we left, we saw a motorcyclist arrive. He signed the
visitors' book at 12.09.'
Simple Active bid Pounds 78,000 a year for the data licence. Skytext bid
Pounds 355,000. In normal circumstances the licence goes to the highest
bidder.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Taxman says there are dogs and dogs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Household dogs must continue to pay value added tax on their food, but
greyhounds can now get their nourishment tax-free, Customs &amp; Excise said
yesterday.
The department has laid down strict guidelines which will allow greyhound
owners to buy feed specifically designed for racing dogs free of VAT.
The decision follows a ruling by the VAT Tribunal which rejected Customs'
argument that greyhound feed should be treated in the same way as pet food
and be subject to VAT at the standard rate.
Customs has now agreed that greyhound feed - like most food for humans  -
will be zero-rated because greyhounds are working animals.
However, to qualify it must be 'a complete feed providing all the required
elements for a balanced diet for a dog'.
The same circular from Customs yesterday made a number of related rulings on
animals and VAT, some of them surprisingly exotic. Purchase of ostriches,
which was previously VAT-free, will now be standard-rated.
Customs said it maintained its position that while grass seed is zero-rated
because it is used as animal feed, pre-germinated seeds were designed for
commercial purposes and should be subject to VAT.
However, it said that because pre-germinated grass seed was widely
zero-rated within the industry at present, it would allow the practice of
exemption to continue 'for the time being'.

FT  13 SEP 94 / BBC plans to start digital radio in 1995
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC plans to start network radio transmissions of digital audio
broadcasting next September. The development is the most important in radio
technology for 40 years.
After next year's launch, the BBC plans to extend the broadcasts, which
provide compact-disc quality distortion-free audio to both car radios and
portable sets, to 60 per cent of the country within the next few years.
Although experimental transmissions are either under way or promised in a
number of other European countries and Canada, the BBC is believed to be the
first broadcaster to have committed itself to providing a service.
Mr Phil Lavin, controller of engineering, outlined the BBC's plans in London
yesterday at the first plenary session of the UK DAB Forum, set up last year
by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to encourage the
development of the new broadcasting technology.
The BBC, as a public-service broadcaster funded by a universal licence fee,
has decided that it should begin broadcasts to stimulate the market for the
special radio sets that will be needed to receive the broadcasts.
The corporation hopes to have covered the main urban areas of the UK and the
motorway network by 1998. Further expansion will depend on the success of
the system.
Lord Chalfont, chairman of the Radio Authority, which regulates commercial
radio, said yesterday the key to success was a strong signal from a major
broadcaster.
He said: 'We value the BBC's ability to take the lead in introducing new
broadcasting technology in partnership with the private sector.'
He expected one or two commercial broadcasters to come in 'at or near the
leading edge', with others joining later.
Apart from proving a better-quality signal, the system is more efficient in
its use of the radio spectrum and its use could ultimately allow an
expansion in choice.
Mr Richard Norman, chairman of the executive council of Breema, the consumer
electronics trade body, said yesterday a group of companies was working to
develop a low-cost design for a receiver, based on purpose-built microchips.
The companies have formed a development club which includes Ensigma, a
company which has experience in the design of the sort of complex chips
needed.
The BBC approach in pioneering a digital audio broadcast service could
provide a model for the introduction of digital terrestrial television in
the UK.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Abstention likely on Bosnia arms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain is likely to abstain in a United Nations vote on lifting the arms
embargo on the Bosnian government, Downing Street said yesterday.
It would mark a significant difference of opinion with the US
administration, which is expected to press for a lifting of the embargo in
the UN Security Council.
Ministers are not considering using their veto, however.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, said: 'If the UN was to decide to
start supplying arms to one of the combatants in this war, there is no way
in which UN forces could remain in Bosnia on a bipartisan basis.'
Mr Rifkind said it was not certain the US would respond to growing domestic
pressure to lift the embargo by proposing a security council resolution - or
that it would win the necessary backing.
Asked if British troops would have to come out, he said: 'I have no doubt
that is what will happen. There is no question about it if the arms embargo
is lifted.'
Lifting the embargo would simply reunite the Serbs and invite Russian
hostility, he warned on BBC Radio.
Although Tory MPs hope a public dispute between the US and the UK can be
avoided after a period in which the international community is seen to close
ranks against the Bosnian Serbs, Downing Street yesterday said: 'The US
administration has known for many months that we believe the lifting of the
arms embargo would make the situation worse.'

A private Greek consortium has signed a protocol with Gazprom, the Russian
state energy supplier, to build a Dollars 600m pipeline across Bulgaria to
carry Russian oil from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean, writes Kerin Hope
in Athens.
The 350km pipeline between the ports of Burgas in Bulgaria and
Alexandroupolis in north-eastern Greece will take three years to build and
will carry 20m-40m tonnes of oil yearly, with storage facilities for about
1bn tonnes to be constructed at the two ports. The Greek consortium includes
the Latsis shipping and oil refining group, the Kopelouzos construction
group and Prometheus, a joint venture between Kopelouzos and Gazprom. The
Bulgarian and Greek state oil companies are also expected to participate in
the project.
The pipeline will provide a new outlet for Russian oil, which will be sent
by sea to Burgas from Novorossysk, and ensure a steady oil supply for
Bulgaria. Gazprom and Prometheus are both involved in a Greek project,
funded mainly by the European Union, to build a 500km pipeline to carry
natural gas from the Bulgarian border to Athens.

Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, yesterday met Senator Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, chairman of the Senate finance committee, in an effort to
clear away final obstacles to passage this year of Uruguay
Round-implementing legislation, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington. Mr Kantor
was widely expected to withdraw the Clinton administration's request for new
'fast-track' authority, needed for further free-trade negotiations, in order
to speed passage of the Round package. Fast-track has become controversial
as Democrats want new trade agreements to include labour and environmental
provisions, which Republicans oppose.
Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the trade subcommittee, called yesterday for
a slow approach to hemispheric free trade, smoothing the way for a
withdrawal of the fast-track request.

FT  13 SEP 94 / World Trade News: China lures auto component groups -
Foreign entrants are reshaping an antiquated industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like participants in a gold rush, the world's top automotive components
manufacturers are scrambling for a niche in China. General Motors'
Automotive Components Group, TRW and Ford of the US, Bosch of Germany,
Toyota and Nissan of Japan, and Daewoo of South Korea are just some of the
names competing in a sector expected to absorb Dollars 20bn of new
investment in the next five years.
Fledgling groups are also entering the field, attracted by the promise of
huge demand for components. American investors, including Dean Witter, the
broking house, have backed, for example, the establishment of Asian
Strategic Investments Corporation (Asimco) which plans to invest Dollars 1bn
over the next two years.
Mr Don St Pierre, president of Asimco, expects a 'revolution' in the
components sector marked by a rash of joint ventures, mergers and the
continuing rationalisation of small, inefficient producers. Many of China
4,800 components manufacturers are expected to go out of business, to be
replaced by larger units with foreign involvement.
Asimco, which raised Dollars 160m initially for its China investments,
recently concluded its first components deal, with Ningguo Rubber in Anhui
province, to produce rubber seals, rings and gaskets. Asimco has another 10
similar deals pending, which are expected to be concluded over the next few
months. Its investment in Anhui is Dollars 11m.
TRW, the big US space technology and automotive parts conglomerate, is
enlarging its presence in China having signed a memorandum of understanding
with Jinan Auto-Accessories Works, one of China's biggest components
manufacturers, to produce about 14m engine valves.
Mr Joseph Gorman, TRW's chief executive officer, said the company wanted to
be a 'player' in China because of tremendous growth prospects in the world's
fastest-growing automotive sector. He said he would not be surprised if, by
early next century, half the 45m-50m cars sold annually out of a total
global car 'population' of 475m were marketed in Asia, with China accounting
for the bulk of new sales.
China's new automotive policy, released in July, is providing the catalyst
for a dramatic transformation of the components sector. Ambitious plans to
supply from domestic production 90 per cent of China's estimated passenger
car needs of 2m units by the end of the century will in itself create a huge
demand for components.
In 1993 China produced 234,000 passengers cars out of total production
nationwide of 1.3m vehicles. About 310,460 vehicles were imported, according
to official figures, but this did not account for the thousands more that
were smuggled in.
Strict local content rules and allied tax incentives mean that components
manufacturers will be competing for a vast captive market. Adding impetus to
the scramble is the demand by Chinese policymakers that international car
makers qualify for permission to build vehicles in China by first investing
in components manufacturing.
This requirement has drawn Ford, General Motors and Daewoo, to name several
of the more prominent manufacturers, into investing heavily in China. Ford,
for example, announced recently that it would spend Dollars 50m in two
projects in the Shanghai area, one of the principal hubs of the automotive
sector in China.
Ford's initial investments include ventures for the fabrication of plastic
automotive items such as instrument panels, and safety glass for
windscreens. Partners are the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation
(SAIC) and Yao Hua Glass Works.
Mr David McKee, vice-president of Ford International Business Development in
Beijing, said the company had 'nailed down' the top 100 or so components
manufacturers with a view to possible joint ventures. Of these, Ford had
singled out eight to 10 as prospective partners with two to three deals
close to completion in such areas as air-conditioning and electronics.
General Motors, through its Automotive Components Group, is engaged in a
similar exercise in identifying investment opportunities. Mr Rudi Von
Meister, ACG's chief representative in Beijing, said the company was
'exploring' more than two dozen projects, and had recently signed a joint
venture agreement to produce electronic engine control systems - the
successor to the carburettor.
This joint venture and other pending deals build on ACG's existing
arrangements in China, which include six licensing agreements for the
production of such items as wiring harnesses, spark plugs, starter motors
and alternators, and steering gears.
Daewoo of South Korea has also signalled its intention to be a big player in
China, with the focus of its activities in Shandong province, south-east of
Beijing. Daewoo, according to Mr St Pierre of Asimco, is planning to fund a
number of components suppliers in Shandong, and also intends to absorb some
of the product in its car making operations in South Korea itself.
Toyota is also reported to be moving towards heavy investment in China,
although the Japanese continue to play their cards close to their chest.
Among options being considered by Toyota is the construction of a
'greenfield' plant near Tianjin to produce transmissions, engines and other
key components for a compact car, possibly the Corolla, to be manufactured
in China.
Across China, hundreds of projects are under negotiation in a process that,
within a few years, will change the face of a hitherto antiquated sector.

FT  13 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Delta presses US for rules on negotiations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Delta Air Lines, the third largest US carrier, yesterday called on the US
government to define a standard framework for negotiating bilateral aviation
agreements.
Mr Ron Allen, Delta's chairman, also said he was increasingly frustrated at
the failure of the US government to approve a partnership with Virgin
Atlantic Airways to give Delta access to London's Heathrow airport.
Delta and Virgin have been forced to postpone the introduction next month of
their commercial partnership because of the US government's delay in
approving the deal. Mr Allen said he would be 'shocked' if his government
ultimately blocked the deal announced earlier this year with the smaller UK
carrier. The partnership has been given the go ahead by the UK authorities.
Under present regulations, only two US carriers - American and United - can
serve Heathrow. Delta argues its partnership with Virgin would increase
competition on transatlantic routes.
Mr Richard Branson, Virgin's chairman, has recently been urging the UK
government to step up pressure on the US to restart negotiations on
liberalising air services between the two countries.
The US walked away from negotiations with the UK on liberalising air
services between the two countries last December and has since refused to
reopen talks.
In the absence of a clearly defined international aviation policy, the US
government has been forced to react to each different bilateral negotiation
without any standard framework, Mr Allen said. This led to considerable
pressure on the US administration from the conflicting interests of US
carriers.
American Airlines, the second largest US carrier which already flies into
Heathrow, has led the campaign against the Delta-Virgin partnership.
The UK is now expected to propose a new round of negotiations and offer
initially greater access for US carriers to regional UK airports in exchange
for US approval of the Delta-Virgin deal as well as other concessions for UK
carriers in the US market.
However, Sir Colin Marshall, chairman of British Airways, yesterday said he
did not expect the talks to start before the end of next month. He said it
was 'ridiculous' that the US government had not approved the Virgin-Delta
deal. The two governments needed to acknowledge publically that their
ultimate aim was total deregulation of airline services between the two
countries.
Although this was likely to take a long time to achieve, Sir Colin said it
was important to establish clear milestones, with both sides making
concessions to achieve the ultimate goal of 'open skies'.

FT  13 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Japan draws French flak on aircraft bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, has stepped into a growing
political row over the Japanese government's selection of a new
multi-purpose support aircraft for its air defence force.
Mr Balladur wrote personally last month to Mr Tomiichi Murayama, his
Japanese counterpart, urging Japan to consider a French aircraft for its
Y30bn (Dollars 303m) ground support project, codenamed UX.
The Self-Defence Agency had decided informally on August 11 to recommend a
US-made Gulfstream aircraft in preference to rival bids from the French
Falcon and Canadian Challenger models. But at a cabinet meeting the next day
at least one minister is understood to have raised objections to the process
by which the aircraft was selected, and the final decision was deferred.
Ministers' doubts were said to have centred on the close involvement of some
politicians from the former coalition government in the decision to back the
Gulfstream bid. There were also concerns that the US aircraft may have been
chosen to improve trade relations between the two countries.
Foreign Ministry officials yesterday refused to comment on newspaper reports
that the French prime minister's letter, which was received in Tokyo on
August 23, had demanded that the Japanese government select its military
materiel through open competition, implicitly criticising the way in which
procurement decisions are made. But they acknowledged that a letter had been
received and that it urged the government to give full consideration to the
French-made aircraft.
Mr Kozo Igarashi, the chief cabinet secretary, told a press conference
yesterday that no final decision had been made on the project. But he said
the letter seemed to have been based principally on considerations of
national interest. 'We should select our next generation aircraft
objectively and rationally,' he said.
French officials in Tokyo refused to comment on the correspondence but
acknowledged it was unusual, but not unprecedented, for heads of government
to intervene personally in such matters.
The Self-Defence Agency began preparing for selection of a new support
aircraft three years ago. It plans to buy nine aircraft, at a cost of about
Y3bn each, over the next five years. They will be used by the Japanese
military to transport commanders and for communications and support of
military exercises.

contract

A Sino-Portuguese company, Administracao de Aeroportos, has been awarded the
contract for operational services at the new Macau airport. The venture is
unusual in that ANA will hold a 51 per cent stake until December 1999, when
Macau reverts to China, when it will concede two percentage points of its
stake to the Chinese partner to give it a controlling interest. The contract
involves all non-commercial operational management services, including air
traffic and ground control management.

Czech Railways and Deutsche Bahn, its German equivalent, are to begin

Czech/German border from September 25 in an attempt to speed up journey
times and lower costs, writes Vincent Boland in Prague.
The service will run on the 110km rail link between Dresden and the Czech
town of Lovosice, 65km north of Prague. A similar service across the
Czech/Austrian border began operating yesterday between Ceske Budjeovice in
southern Bohemia and Villach in Austria. The Czech/German link will
initially carry 25 trucks daily but it is expected to be able to transport a
quarter of the estimated 2,000 freight vehicles that cross the border each
day. The journey time is expected to be 2 1/2 hours, with continuous customs
facilities. The service will cost DM85 (Dollars 54) per journey, with the
German state of Saxony covering any shortfall.

FT  13 SEP 94 / World Trade News: BMW points way with its first US assembly
plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BMW of Germany yesterday began production at its first US assembly plant, a
key step in the overseas expansion of the European car industry, writes
Kevin Done, Motor Industry Correspondent.
BMW becomes the only European car maker with a passenger vehicle assembly
plant in the US, although it will be joined in 1996/97 by Mercedes-Benz, its
big domestic rival, which is developing a plant in Alabama. Japanese car
makers have been expanding rapidly in North America during the last decade,
while the European presence has shrunk drastically.
None of the European volume car makers has a production base in the US
following the move by Volkswagen of Germany to close its plant at
Westmoreland, Pennsylvania, in 1987 after nine years of production.
BMW has invested Dollars 400m to develop its new plant at Spartanburg, South
Carolina. It said yesterday that production would reach 300 cars a day by
the end of 1996. Toward the end of the decade the capacity of the plant will
be increased to 90,000 units a year.
Initially BMW is producing its 3-Series car range at the US plant, but from
the end of 1995 the Spartanburg facility will become BMW's only production
source for a new range of two-seater sports cars, which will be sold both in
North America and in other BMW markets worldwide.
Mercedes-Benz is investing Dollars 300m to develop a plant near Tuscaloosa,
Alabama, for the production of a new range of four-wheel drive
sports/utility vehicles, which are to be launched in the world market in
1997.
The plant will employ 1,500 people and will produce 60,000 vehicles a year.
The European car production presence in the US will still be modest by
comparison with the capacity developed by Japanese vehicle makers, which
last year produced more than 2m cars and light trucks at 10 plants - wholly
owned and joint ventures - in the US and Canada.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Strike called in Uttar Pradesh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh was braced yesterday for a general
strike called by the state government amid growing inter-caste violence and
political turmoil.
Mr Mulayam Singh Yadav, the state's chief minister, rejected a call from
Premier P V Narasimha Rao to cancel the strike for fear it might provoke
violent demonstrations. Mr Yadav, who came to power last autumn at the head
of a lower-caste alliance of parties, is the first politician to rule Uttar
Pradesh in the name of the lower castes.
His avowed policy is to promote their interests at the expense of the upper
castes. His intentions are important because Uttar Pradesh, India's most
populous state, is regarded as the cradle of Indian politics. Success for
caste-based politics there could threaten other states' stability.
The Uttar Pradesh crisis has come from Mr Yadav's efforts to implement job
reservation policy. Under Indian law, up to 50 per cent of public-sector
jobs and places at many colleges must be reserved for lower castes. But the
law has rarely been fully implemented.
Mr Yadav's attempt to hasten this has caused widespread unrest in northern
Uttar Pradesh, where 74 per cent of the population is upper caste. In the
last month, about 10 people, including one senior police officer. have been
killed in violent demonstrations. Yesterday, crowds burnt vehicles in the
hill town of Dehra Dun.
Mr Yadav's government last night was verging on collapse. The ruling
alliance of the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Samajwadi Party commands only
198 of 425 state assembly seats, and has been ruling with the support of 32
Congress(I) members who joined Mr Yadav to keep the Hindu Bharatiya Janata
Party out of power. But local Congress leaders have asked Mr Rao's
permission to quit the coalition.

<TEXT>
New Zealand has its first coalition government for 50 years following the
decision of junior minister, Mr Ross Meurant, to form his own party which
will continue to support the administration of prime minister Jim Bolger.
Mr Bolger said in a radio interview yesterday that Mr Meurant's move was
expected and he believed another party backbencher, Michael Laws, would also
announce he was forming a new party soon.
Mr Meurant announced the formation of the Right of Centre Party on Sunday
night
He said it aimed to appeal to disgruntled former members of the National
party who wanted a more moderate approach, and to provide a potential
coalition partner for the National party after the next election.
Right of Centre would pitch itself at 15-20 per cent of voters in each
constituency, and hoped to gain at least 10 seats.
Mr Bolger has said for some time that he expected defections from both main
political parties as New Zealand moved towards adopting a voting system
giving parties seats in parliament if they achieve a minimum threshold of
the national vote, as in Germany. If the National party retains its narrow
majority, the next election will be held under this system, favouring
smaller parties, rather than the British Westminster system.
Mr Bolger said he had entered into an agreement with Mr Meurant who would
support the government on all main issues to ensure it stayed in power for
its full three-year term. Mr Meurant will retain his post as agriculture and
forestry under-secretary.
Mr Meurant is a controversial MP who sprang to national prominence in the
early 1980s when, as a senior policeman, he led the so-called Red Squads
that battled street demonstrators who were fighting against South African
rugby tours.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Murayama acknowledges 'crushing defeat'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's prime minister, acknowledged yesterday that
the ruling coalition led by his Social Democratic party (SDP) and the
Liberal Democratic party (LDP) had suffered a 'crushing defeat' in Sunday's
Upper House by-election in Aichi Prefecture.
The candidate backed by the government lost heavily to a representative of
the opposition parties in the first electoral test since the administration
was formed in June.
Mr Murayama attributed the setback to a late start to the coalition's
campaign, and an inability to differentiate its policies from those of its
opponents. 'It is regrettable,' he declared. 'I accept the result humbly and
will try again.'
Opposition leaders hailed their victory as a mandate to create a new, single
political party to fight the next election.
'We will put all our energy into forming a new party,' said Mr Tsutomu Hata,
the former prime minister and leading light behind the unity moves. 'The
people are investing high hopes that we will persistently pursue reform and
conduct responsible politics.'
The opposition's candidate, Mr Yuzuru Tsuzuki, a former labour ministry
official, won 931,936 votes, easily defeating the governing parties'
nominee, Mr Jiro Mizuno, a former United Nations diplomat, who polled
544,637 votes.
But a more detailed analysis of the result suggests that the opposition's
early euphoria may be misplaced. In fact there was little enthusiasm for
either of the two main groupings.
Though the government's performance was lamentable, the main beneficiaries
were not the opposition but independent candidates. At the last election in
1992, the constituency was evenly divided, returning two members from the
present opposition and one from the governing LDP.
In that election the LDP and SDP (running separately) secured 42 per cent of
the total vote between them, against 44 per cent for the combined vote of
today's opposition parties.
Coalition support slumped to just 25.1 per cent, but while the opposition
was comfortably ahead, its proportion of the vote also fell slightly, to 43
per cent.
The big winners were the various independent candidates, one of whom, Mrs
Makiko Suehiro, a local television personality, came close to beating Mr
Mizuno into third place. Altogether, five other candidates took a remarkable
31.9 per cent of the vote, up from 14 per cent in 1992. This strong
performance by independents and parties not aligned with the opposition
coalition, combined with the low turnout (at 43 per cent the fourth lowest
for the constituency since the second world war) points to a significant
degree of voter disillusionment with the main parties.
During the campaign, opinion polls suggested that electors were dissatisfied
with the chaotic nature of Japanese politics which, in little over a year,
has produced no fewer than four changes of government.
The same polls detected a degree of cynicism from voters about the
seriousness of any party's commitment to political reform, a genuinely
popular concept.
That cynicism was exacerbated by the fact that both government and
opposition asserted with equal vigour throughout the campaign their
commitment to reform.
Nevertheless, the political runes are undoubtedly more alarming for the SDP
and the LDP. Sunday's defeat is likely to accentuate the tensions within the
uneasy alliance.
But it also makes a general election an even more distant prospect.
The two main coalition partners will probably choose to cling to each other
more tightly, postponing for as long as possible their appointment with the
nation's voters.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Indonesian whispers turn to shouts: A report on the Jakarta
opposition's efforts to unravel the latest alleged banking scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MANUELA SARAGOSA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Members of Indonesian opposition parties are stepping up efforts to bring
details of an alleged banking scandal into the open.
The attorney-general's office in Jakarta is investigating the bad debts of
PT Kanindo Prima Perkasa textile company, owned and operated by Mr Robby
Tjahjadi, a controversial businessman jailed in the 1970s for smuggling.
Mr Tjahjadi is alleged to have defaulted on about Rp 500bn of debts (Pounds
149m) at two state-owned banks, Bank Bumi Daya and Bank Pembangunan
Indonesia, more commonly referred to as Bapindo. His company, Kanindo, is
said to be suffering from serious liquidity problems.
The Bapindo bank is also at the centre of another scandal involving Mr Eddy
Tansil, owner of the Golden Key Group, recently sentenced to 17 years'
imprisonment for defrauding the bank of more than Dollars 450m.
The case exposed the extent to which lenders collude illegally with
borrowers to secure loans, bringing out in the open the level of bad debts
at state banks.
The Tansil case 'is an appalling reality' that suggest the Indonesian
banking industry is an instrument for activities of legalised crime,' said
Mr Laksamana Sukardi, an economic consultant and prominent member of the
opposition party PDI, said.
No one has been arrested or brought to trial yet in the Kanindo case, but
many Indonesians are demanding that someone be held responsible. Mr Tjahjadi
is thought to be in Singapore.
Adding a twist to the Kanindo case are allegations that the textile company
managed to secure additional loans from Bapindo as recently as April by
issuing fake export documents to support its loan application. If this is
true, the company would have secured a loan from Bapindo while a number of
Bapindo executives were standing trial for their involvement in the Golden
Key loan case which shook the banking establishment in Indonesia.
In an effort to resolve Kanindo's bad debts problems, Mr M Muhammad,
Indonesia's finance minister, has appointed the Federation of Indonesian
Batik Co-operatives to take over the management of the company. The
government is also courting the textile group Texmaco to take over Kanindo's
assets.
Details of the Kanindo case were made public late last year but the
government did not take any action at the time.
Mr Tjahjadi was summoned to appear in a parliamentary hearing but members
who questioned him about the state of his loans could not back up their
allegations because of banking secrecy laws. Since then, opposition parties
have increased pressure on the government to take action against Mr
Tjahjadi.
The Kanindo affair is raising questions about the government's efforts to
clean up the banking sector.
The scandal involving the Golden Key group prompted Mr Muhammad to expose
the extent of bad loans at state banks, an effort praised by private
commercial banks.
Mr Muhammad announced earlier this year that 21.2 per cent, or about Dollars
7bn, of the outstanding loans extended by the state banks were classified as
bad or doubtful, compared with 17.4 per cent at the end of 1992 and 16 per
cent in 1990. Economists and bankers in Jakarta say the figure could be much
higher.
Since then, Indonesia's central bank, Bank Indonesia, has been conducting
investigations into state banks with problem loans, singling out companies
that have caused the problems. Mr Sudradjad Djiwandono, governor of the
central bank, said a supervisory team had been formed with the Ministry of
Finance.
'We've asked banks to identify the clients creating problems for them and
we're dealing with them one by one,' the governor said.
Now Indonesians are demanding to know how the central bank could have
overlooked Kanindo's bad debts.
'The Kanindo case is causing us major apprehension,' said an editorial in
the English-language daily, the Jakarta Post.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Algerian debt talks take on a surreal aspect: Fears over the
country's political stability cloud an encouraging report from the IMF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International bankers meeting in Paris today to discuss the restructuring of
Algeria's commercial bank debt should be comforted by the results of the
first review of the economy conducted by the IMF since it signed an
agreement with north Africa's largest country six month ago and extended a
Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) stand-by credit to back up significant economic
reforms. In the six months to the end of June, money supply grew more slowly
than had been agreed with the IMF. The value of the dinar, which was
devalued by 40 per cent last April, has remained virtually unchanged since
then. Officials claim that inflation, running at more than 40 per cent
earlier this year, will decline to below 30 per cent by the year end. And
the budget deficit has been cut from 9.2 per cent of gross domestic product
in 1993 to 3.1 per cent. Less positively, many officials say that 2 per cent
GDP growth is the most that can be hoped for, as opposed to earlier IMF
forecasts of 3.1 per cent.
This is explained by the severe drought, which will force Algeria to import
95 per cent of its cereals consumption against last year's 75 per cent, the
sharp drop in purchasing power caused by the devaluation, a reluctance to
invest, and the sheer difficulty of running factories at a time of serious
civil strife. The IMF agreement, and the rescheduling of part of Algeria's
debt to foreign governments which followed last May's Paris Club meeting,
have loosened the stranglehold of debt. The debt service ratio, as a
percentage of exports of goods and services, will fall this year from 86.4
per cent to 52.9 per cent. Imports of raw materials and capital goods are
forecast to increase by Dollars 1.1bn to Dollars 9.15bn, just below the
Dollars 9.4bn agreed with the IMF. Hard currency reserves minus gold have
increased by Dollars 600m to Dollars 2.1bn since the end of 1993.
An estimated 100,000 new jobs are being created this year. However, with
240,000 young Algerians entering the labour market annually, the country is
still burdened with an unemployment rate of 27 per cent. Algerian officials
accept that a faster rate of economic growth is impossible until
restructuring of the myriad loss-making state enterprises is fully under way
and a measure of civil peace is established.
The first task the bankers must address today is the formation of a steering
committee and appointment of a chairman. Two-thirds of Algeria's Dollars
4.7bn commercial debt is owed to Japanese banks and leasing companies. They
all agree, however, that Algeria is primarily within the French sphere of
influence, and do not relish taking a high profile while the political
future is so uncertain.
Of the three leading French banks, Credit Lyonnais, which chaired the
steering committee three years ago, feels it has shouldered its fair share
of responsibility. Societe Generale, which has the largest exposure of the
three banks to Algeria, has little experience of this kind of operation,
while Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) can argue it has virtually no Algerian
paper on its books. The betting in Paris is that the French Finance Ministry
will 'instruct' one of the three banks to step forward.
Bankers do not as yet know how much of Algeria's remaining Dollars 3.1bn
commercial debt (the Dollars 1.6bn refinanced in 1991 will not be affected)
they will be asked to restructure. If principal repayments for 1994 alone
are considered, the amount would be Dollars 700m, but if repayments for 1994
and 1995 are included, the sum rises to Dollars 1.4bn. Nor do they know
whether a 'London Club' rescheduling or some other formula will be agreed.
The Japanese banks made provisions for their Algerian loans in July.
Whatever the outcome of today's meeting and the imprimatur the IMF is likely
to give Algeria, the discussions on the restructuring of Algeria's foreign
debt remain, in the words of one senior banker, 'somewhat surrealistic'.
All participants at the meeting are well aware that without a political
solution to Algeria's 21-month-old crisis, 'figures, however good, are
figures and no more'.

<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
More than 150 governments last night accepted a sweeping UN document setting
a global agenda for population stabilisation policies into the next century,
enshrining for the first time a concept of 'reproductive rights'.
What some delegates described as the 'toughest day yet' of negotiating at
the International Conference on Population and Development cleared up almost
all remaining contentious issues regarding 'reproductive and sexual health'
and the reunification of migrant workers' families, ready to submit a final
text for approval at a plenary meeting today.
'There was a semblance of divergence,' said Mr Nicolas Biegman, the Dutch
diplomat and vice-chairman of the committee discussing the text. 'But on a
great proportion of issues of population and development, including family
planning, the nations of the world think largely in the same way.'
The final document is set for approval by participating states today, though
some, including the Vatican, are expected to voice reservations on at least
some parts of the text regarding abortion and reproductive health. A formal
Vatican reservation is expected today.
Yesterday's haggling focused mainly on definitions of 'reproductive and
sexual health' which had raised opposition from Moslem and Catholic
countries. Delegates said many misunderstandings surrounding these issues
had been cleared up, particularly with Moslem states.
Western medical delegates praised the document for defining for the first
time in 'international language' a broad concept of reproductive and
maternal health.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Israeli-PLO aid row moves to Oslo

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman and Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign
minister, meet in Oslo today to try to resolve a row over foreign aid which
derailed last week's international donors conference and delayed the release
of money for the cash-strapped Palestinian self-rule authority.
The row focuses on Palestinian demands for donors to fund projects in
Israeli-occupied Arab East Jerusalem and is yet another example of the
tortuous problems both sides have in implementing their fragile peace
agreement signed exactly a year ago.
Last week's aid meeting in Paris broke down after Israel flatly refused to
allow East Jerusalem projects to be considered as part of the 1995
aid-funded Palestinian budget. Under the self-rule agreement, both sides
postponed discussions on the future of Jerusalem until late 1995. However,
the plight of Arab East Jerusalem remains the most emotive issue to
Palestinians and a constant rallying point of Mr Arafat's critics who say he
has conceded too much in peace talks with Israel.
For the moment, the Palestinians have little alternative but to give in to
Israeli opposition.
The authority urgently needs donors to speed up the release of hundreds of
millions of dollars of promised aid to help with economic development and
meet high economic expectations.
The PLO has presented a revised budget deficit of Dollars 25m (Pounds 16.1m)
a month.
Israel has said it is reluctant to proceed with the transfer authority over
health, welfare, taxation and tourism to the Palestinians in the still
occupied West Bank until there are firm commitments by donors to meet the
financial gap. The PLO is also desperate for an aid agreement to establish a
'Cop Fund' worth Dollars 7m a month to pay for the 9,000-strong Palestinian
security forces.
For their part, international donors continue to insist the PLO demonstrates
better financial management, institution building and commitment to tax
collection.
Mr Arafat and Mr Avraham Shochat, Israeli finance minister, met in Gaza
yesterday to ease the row that Mr Shochat called 'a small crisis'.
The US yesterday announced financial backing for five business ventures in
Gaza, Jericho and the West Bank by the Overseas Private Investment
Corporation, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington. Vice-president Al Gore said
loans and political risk insurance would be provided for various projects
which amount to nearly Dollars 90m in American business investment.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Cubans flee via open south coast

More Cubans appear to be leaving the unsupervised south coast of their
country for neighbouring islands in the Caribbean, as Cuban police continue
to patrol sections of Cuba's north coast to deter boat people from heading
for the US.
Government officials in the Cayman Islands and Jamaica said yesterday they
feared the Cuban move to restrict those fleeing the north coast on rafts,
following the agreement last week by the Cuban and US government to curb
illegal migration, would lead to a southward rush of refugees.
More than 200 refugees arrived in the Cayman Islands over the weekend,
despite an announcement last week by the government of the UK dependency
that all 'economic migrants' would be repatriated. This brings to 620 the
number of Cubans refugees on the Caymans, whose administration said it had
no more money to take care of Cubans.
Cuba's government said at the weekend that, until midday today, it would try
to persuade would-be refugees not to depart in home-made rafts and boats.
The government said that, after the deadline, the authorities would use
force if necessary to stop rafters from leaving, especially if they resisted
violently.
After the accord with the US, a flotilla of rafts carrying refugees rushed
to leave beaches near Havana before the authorities moved to stop them.
Britain is in the final stages of negotiating an investment promotion and
protection agreement with Cuba, in an effort to raise its trade and
investment profile there.
'I hope we will be able to reach an agreement. We are in the final stages of
discussions,' Mr Ian Taylor, trade and technology minister, said late on
Sunday at the start of a three-day visit to Cuba by a business and official
delegation.
Mr Taylor said the UK government saw good prospects for increased trade and
investment. He said he was concerned Britain was lagging behind Europe and
Nafta nations in developing economic links with the island.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Venezuela to raise petrol prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN and STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CARACAS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Venezuelan government yesterday made public a two-year economic
stabilisation and recovery programme that confirmed plans to raise domestic
petrol prices next year.
The low price of petrol - high-octane fuel is sold for the equivalent of 12
US cents (8p) a gallon - causes big losses for the state oil company PDVSA
and a loss of potential tax revenues. But governments have feared social
unrest that might stem from raised prices.
The programme envisages government income from the sale of domestic petrol
would increase to 2.1 per cent of GDP in 1995 from 0.7 per cent this year.
This would be accompanied by fuel subsidies for public transport, and a
conversion of the bus fleet to natural gas usage. Workers on the minimum
wage would receive a bonus to cope with higher transport costs.
The idea is to keep inflation at a maximum 65 per cent for 1994, and reduce
it to 25 per cent in 1995. The government wants to maintain foreign exchange
reserves at Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.5bn) this year - it said capital flight
this year had cut reserves to a critical Dollars 8bn - and at Dollars 10.8bn
in 1995. Growth is forecast next year at 0.5 per cent, after an expected
negative 3.3 per cent this.
The public sector deficit this year was projected at 3.5 per cent of GDP,
down from 5 per cent last year, and is forecast to become a surplus of 1.1
per cent by next year. However, the so-called quasi-fiscal deficit - arising
out of efforts to stem a deep financial crisis - is projected at 12.5 per
cent of GDP. This would be covered by bond issues.
The government said it would seek to raise overall tax revenues to 21.9 per
cent of GDP next year, mainly by lifting returns from non-oil taxes from 8
per cent of GDP to 12.2 per cent.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Scandals and growth fears dent PRI win: Mexican investors
are taking a cautious view of the new government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The euphoria that many investors had expected would follow a comfortable
victory by Mexico's ruling party in the presidential election last month has
failed to materialise.
Since Mr Ernesto Zedillo emerged triumphant from the August 21 election,
allegations of banking fraud and corruption, the opposition's refusal to
endorse the result, and uncertainty over economic policy have cast a cloud
over the political and economic scene.
Investors - who had bet heavily on the Institutional Revolutionary Party's
(PRI) victory - seem more cautious than in the days before the election. The
stock market has risen only slighlty from pre-election levels. Contrary to
forecasts, short-term interest rates have risen and the exchange rate has
weakened.
The current nervousness over the political situation may soon fade. Having
won more than 50 per cent of the vote, in elections many outside observers
believe the freest Mexico has had, Mr Zedillo has a strong mandate to deepen
the pro-market economic policies of President Carlos Salinas, and push ahead
with further democratic reforms. Many expect Mr Zedillo's programme to boost
economic growth and reduce political instability.
However, for the moment confidence has been dented by the order for the
arrest of Mr Carlos Cabal Peniche, the head of Mexico's fourth largest
financial group and of the Del Monte Fresh Produce agro-business, on charges
that his banks illegally lent him Dollars 700m (Pounds 451m). Mr Cabal was
one of Mexico's leading businessmen, with strong ties to politicians in the
south-east and many entrepreneurs who have risen to prominence during the
administration of Mr Salinas.
While the scandal appears not to have affected the stability of the
financial system, the opposition has attacked the government for giving Mr
Cabal two banking licences.
The incident may make foreigners more careful about backing Mexican
businessmen. Mr Cabal's purchase of Del Monte Fresh had been partly financed
by Dollars 300m of high-yield bonds placed in international markets by
Morgan Stanley.
Allegations by Mr Eduardo Valle, a former official in the attorney-general's
office, surround the Cabal affair. Drug traffickers, he said, infiltrated
the security team of the Institutional Revolutionary Party's initial
presidential candidate Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, who was assassinated in
March. Traffickers may have ordered the assassination, it is alleged.
Mr Valle separately raised questions about Mr Emilio Gamboa, communications
and transport minister, who last November received in his offices a woman
alleged to be representating a drug cartel.
The attorney-general's office has dismissed the allegations of links between
drug traffickers and government and PRI officials, and Mr Gamboa has
vehemently denied any impropriety. Mr Valle's accusations have damaged the
credibility of the government's counter-drug operations, and are said to
have divided the Salinas administration.
These scandals have coincided with harsh attacks by the left-wing opposition
Party of Democratic Revolution on the conduct of the presidential election.
Mr Cuahtemoc Cardenas, PRD presidential candidate, has gradually hardened
his line against the government, claiming that 10m votes were stolen. He has
led rallies in two states against the results, and threatened to spurn
future elections. His rallies have had little public support, but have
emphasised the continuing and apparently unbridgeable divide between the PRI
and the leftist opposition, which won 17 per cent of the total vote.
In the state of Chiapas, Zapatista rebels who launched a rebellion at the
beginning of the year have backed the cause of Mr Cardenas.
While the leaders of the centre-right National Action Party (PAN) have
grudgingly accepted that the PRI won the election, radical factions have
supported Mr Cardenas's position. Mr Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, the PAN's
presidential candidate, after initially accepting defeat, has since
described the PRI's victory as illegitimate.
Feverish speculation over the policy and appointments of the new Zedillo
administration has further heightened uncertainty. There is growing concern
over the content of a new 'pacto,' the agreement between business, labour
and the government under which price, wage and exchange rate policy is set.
Mr Zedillo is expected to set the general policies of the new pacto, even
though he does not take office until December. While Mr Zedillo has publicly
said he does not believe in a abrupt devaluation of the peso, there is
speculation he may support an increase in the daily maximum depreciation of
the peso/dollar rate of 40 centavos a day.
The possibility of a change in exchange rate policy has been heightened by a
reported division between Mr Pedro Aspe, the finance minister, and the
central bank, on the one hand, and Mr Guillermo Ortiz, the powerful deputy
finance minister, on the other. The former are believed to support a strong
currency so as to maintain the fight against inflation. Mr Ortiz is said to
back a faster devaluation of the currency as a way to boost exports and
economic growth.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Havana minister in Madrid impasse

<TEXT>
Mr Roberto Robana, Cuba's foreign minister, is waging a week-long diplomatic
offensive in Madrid to rescue the credibility of his government, but so far
has met only reservations from Spanish officials and hostility from Cuban
opposition groups, writes Tom Burns in Madrid.
Spain is trying to broker a transition towards political pluralism and a
market economy in Cuba. Madrid is urging on Mr Robana's 'profound and rapid'
reforms. The talks follow a Cuban-US meeting in New York last week which
yielded an agreement to halt the flow of Cuban illegal migrants to the US.
Madrid, which has played a discreet economic advisory role to the Cuban
government over the past year, is understood to be particularly disappointed
that a package of measures to deregulate the Caribbean state's economy,
drawn up by Mr Carlos Solchaga, a Spanish former finance minister, has been
largely ignored in Havana.
Mr Javier Solana, Spain's foreign minister, warned after extended talks with
Mr Robana that 'a possible solution today may no longer be possible
tomorrow'.
A spokeswoman for the Cuban minister, who will stay in Spain until tomorrow,
acknowleged yesterday that differences had emerged in discussions with
Madrid.
Cuban opposition politicians and human rights groups abroad claim that
individual, private meetings of Mr Robana and selected Cubans from the US,
organised by the Spanish government in Madrid, are merely cosmetic.
'There is no undertaking by (Cuban President) Fidel (Castro) to meet the
internal opposition in Cuba,' said Mr Antonio Guedes, an executive member of
the Cuban Democratic Platform, an opposition grouping of liberal, Christian
democratic and social democratic parties.
The platform, which supports the US trade embargo on Havana but is seen as
moderate, had signalled its willingness to meet Mr Robana when approached by
the Spanish foreign ministry. However, the Cuban minister rejected the
feeler.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Congress cold on reform of healthcare
</HEADLINE>

   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Congress returned to Washington yesterday, after two weeks in recess,
with less appetite than ever for any kind of healthcare legislation, writes
George Graham in Washington.
In spite of last-minute efforts to achieve a minimal compromise that could
squeeze through both chambers of Congress in the next month, there is little
wind left in the sails of the reform which President Bill Clinton launched a
year ago with his detailed plan to guarantee health insurance to everyone in
the US.
It is by no means clear that even a compromise measure could spur enough
enthusiasm to pass even the Senate. Its prospects in the House of
Representatives seem close to zero.
The coalition that would prefer to do nothing this year includes the bulk of
the Republicans - some are wary of tinkering with the healthcare industry,
while others are simply determined to deny the Democrats any claims of
victory - and those left-leaning Democrats who favour a national healthcare
system.
In purely political terms, some Democrats would prefer to give up the search
for healthcare reform rather than face defeat a few weeks before the
congressional elections on November 8.
Most members appear convinced there is little to be gained by pressing ahead
with healthcare reform at all costs.

FT  13 SEP 94 / World Bank backing for investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The World Bank has approved a proposal to use its financial might to boost
flows of private sector finance to projects in the developing world.
The board voted to use the bank's guarantee authority to offer investors
insurance against the risk of governments changing their policies - a risk
which has inhibited investors' willingness to put their money in developing
nation projects.
The decision will allow the bank to offer guarantees routinely, and to offer
them on a stand-alone basis when it is not co-financing a project.
The move marks a step in the World Bank's efforts to expand its involvement
in the private sector. Although all its policy advice to governments in the
developing world urges the virtues of privatisation and private sector
capital, the bank itself is bound by its articles to lend only to
governments or state institutions.
Although the bank's International Finance Corporation subsidiary invests in
the private sector, and its Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
provides insurance mostly for equity investments, both have limited
resources; the bulk of the group's financial muscle is in the main bank.
An influential report this year from the Bretton Woods commission convened
by Mr Paul Volcker, former chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board, said
that 'of the challenges facing the World Bank Group, none is greater than
adapting to a world that has turned from public sector dominance towards
private enterprise and free markets'.
But bank officials say private investors are often wary governments may
change the rules: if they have funded an electricity plant, for example,
will the government regulator stop them selling power at market prices?
The World Bank has been experimenting with its guarantee power in some of
its co-financing operations. In the Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.16bn) Hub River
power project in Pakistan, for example, the bank has guaranteed commercial
lenders against some risks, such as the possibility that the government
might not fulfil its obligation to provide fuel and to distribute the power
generated.

<TEXT>
The pilot of the aircraft that crashed on a White House lawn early
yesterday, after penetrating high-security air space, had 'a history of
mental illness', investigators said, Reuter reports from Washington.
A US secret service spokesman identified the pilot, who died in the crash,
as Frank Eugene Corder, aged 38, of no fixed address. The single-engined
Cessna had been stolen from the county airport at Harford, Maryland, about
50 miles from Washington.
President Bill Clinton, his wife Hillary and their daughter Chelsea were
asleep a few hundred yards away across Pennsylvania Avenue in Blair House, a
guest residence, when the aircraft crashed at about 2am, sliding against the
White House. The family has moved out of the mansion while repairs are made.
A witness said that the aircraft's engine had been switched off. The
aeroplane swooped from the direction of the Washington Monument and passed
over a high, steel-rail fence before ploughing into the White House lawn.

<TEXT>
The main unions in Brazil's vehicle industry went on strike yesterday for an
immediate pay rise, in the first serious threat to a wage freeze introduced
under the government's anti-inflation plan, writes Angus Foster in Rio de
Janeiro.
Production at all large factories, based in Sao Paulo state, was much
affected. Union officials said nearly half their 150,000 members had stopped
work yesterday. Autolatina, Brazil's biggest carmaker and a joint venture of
Volkswagen and Ford, said production had 'almost totally stopped'. Anfavea,
the car-makers' association, said that, if the strike lasted more than a few
days, it would seriously disrupt sales because demand is high and stocks are
'non-existent'.
Unions are calling for salaries to be increased monthly so as to make up for
losses in purchasing power through inflation. Such monthly increases were
common before the introduction, on July 1, of Brazil's new currency, the
Real, under the anti-inflation plan. The government has now ruled that wage
increases can only be granted once a year.
Union leaders argue that official inflation indices show an 11.9 per cent
increase since the new currency was launched. They also argue that a 1992
agreement by labour, car-makers and government guaranteed monthly increases.

A light aircraft, with its engine switched off, penetrated high-security air
space and crashed on a White House lawn early yesterday. It slid against the
mansion, killing the pilot. President Bill Clinton, his family and staff
were unharmed, Reuter reports from Washington.
Security agencies were trying to determine whether they were dealing with a
bizarre accident or a kamikaze-style attack. The pilot was tentatively
identified as a man from the neighbouring state of Maryland. Officials were
pursuing reports he had stolen the aircraft from a Maryland air club and
were checking reports that he had a history of mental illness.
The president, Mrs Hillary Clinton and their daughter Chelsea were asleep a
few hundred yards away across Pennsylvania Avenue in Blair House, a guest
residence.
The aeroplane swooped from the direction of the Washington Monument, passed
over a high, steel-rail fence and ploughed into the White House back lawn at
about 2am local time.
There were no reports that White House security forces had fired at the
aircraft.
The US secret service and the US army are believed to have installed
anti-aircraft weapons on the mansion and a next-door building after a
similar airborne intrusion in 1974.

More Cubans appear to be leaving the unsupervised south coast of their
country for neighbouring islands in the Caribbean, as Cuban police continue
to patrol sections of Cuba's north coast to deter boat people from heading
for the US.
Government officials in the Cayman Islands and Jamaica said yesterday they
feared the Cuban move to restrict rafters fleeing the north coast, following
the agreement last week by the Cuban and US government to curb illegal
migration, would lead to a southward rush of refugees.
More than 200 refugees arrived in the Cayman Islands over the weekend,
despite an announcement last week by the government of the UK dependency
that all 'economic migrants' would be repatriated. This brings to 620 the
number of Cubans refugees on the Caymans, whose administration said it had
no more money to take care of Cubans.
Cuba's government said at the weekend that, until midday today, it would try
to persuade would-be refugees not to depart in home-made rafts and boats.
'We really don't want to use force,' an official statement said. But it
added that, after the deadline, the authorities would use force if necessary
to stop rafters from leaving, especially if they resisted violently.
After the accord with the US, a flotilla of rafts carrying refugees rushed
to leave beaches near Havana before the authorities moved to stop them.
'The agreement means nothing for us,' said Mr Severo Estupinan, 59, as he
prepared to depart. 'People will keep on leaving.' More than 32,000 Cubans
have fled the recession-hit island this year, most during the last month.
Jamaican immigration officers yesterday began interviewing 25 Cubans who had
walked off a beach and into one of the island's more exclusive north-coast
resort hotels at the weekend. They had left Cuba from the south coast.
'Most of the Cubans coming here, and I presume those going to the Cayman
Islands, want to go eventually to the US,' said a Jamaican government
spokesman.
'But the US is not taking them. If they are not repatriated, their first
port of call - the Caymans and Jamaica - will be their home for some time.'
He said, however, that the Jamaican government did not plan to repatriate
any Cuban refugees.

The US Congress returned to Washington yesterday, after two weeks in recess,
with less appetite than ever for any kind of healthcare legislation.
In spite of last-minute efforts to achieve a minimal compromise that could
squeeze through both chambers of Congress in the next month, there is little
wind left in the sails of the reform which President Bill Clinton launched a
year ago with his detailed plan to guarantee health insurance to everyone in
the US.
Some centrist Democrats continued to work with Senator John Chafee and a
band of moderate Republicans on a compromise bill, based on reforms to the
insurance market and subsidies to expand health insurance coverage.
This mainstream group has also begun discussions with backers of the more
ambitious reform plan, proposed by Senator George Mitchell, Democratic
majority leader in the Senate, to see whether the two can come together.
However, it is by no means clear that such a compromise measure can spur
enough enthusiasm to pass even the Senate. Its prospects in the House of
Representatives seem close to zero.
Only four weeks now remain before Congress is due to rise for a month of
campaigning in the election on November 8 faced by the whole House and a
third of the Senate.
The coalition that would prefer to do nothing at all this year now includes
the bulk of the Republican members - some of whom are wary of tinkering with
the healthcare industry, while others are simply determined to deny Mr
Clinton and the Democrats any chance of claiming a victory - and those
left-leaning Democrats who favour a national healthcare system.
This group, led by Congressman Jim McDermott, appears firmly opposed to any
diluted reform. So does Mr Clinton. He has appeared to back away from the
theatrical threat, made in his State of the Union speech early this year to
veto any bill that did not guarantee universal coverage, but the threat has
not been lifted.
What is more, it might have been possible to gloss over the question of
whether reforms that covered 96 or 97 per cent of the population constituted
universal coverage, but no measure now available would come close to that.
In pure political terms, some Democrats would prefer to give up the search
for healthcare reform as soon as possible, rather than face an ignominious
defeat a few weeks before the congressional elections.
Most members appear convinced that there is little to be gained with their
constituents by pressing ahead with reform at all costs.

<TEXT>
Britain is in the final stages of negotiating an investment promotion and
protection agreement with Cuba in an effort to raise its trade and
investment profile in the Caribbean's largest island, writes Pascal Fletcher
in Havana.
'I hope we will be able to reach an agreement . . . we are in the final
stages of discussions,' Mr Ian Taylor, trade and technology minister, said
late on Sunday at the start of a three-day visit to Cuba by a delegation of
businessmen and trade officials. The last official visit by a British
minister to the communist-ruled island was almost 20 years ago.
Mr Taylor said that despite the two countries' different political and
economic systems and the recession gripping Cuba, the British government saw
good prospects for increased trade and investment. He said he was concerned
Britain was lagging behind Europe and Nafta nations in developing economic
links with the island.
Mr Taylor said he would be evaluating the economic reforms in Cuba since the
collapse of its ties with the former Soviet bloc. Reforms to the
state-controlled agriculture system were critical, he said.
He would also discuss the issue of Cuba's outstanding debt to the Paris Club
and to British companies. The latter is estimated to total Pounds 60m.
Mr Taylor drew a distinction between Britain's attitude to Cuba and the US
trade embargo against the island. 'My view about our trade with Cuba is that
it's less influenced by what America does, and more influenced by how strong
Cuba's opening towards market forces is,' he said.
UK exports to Cuba totalled Pounds 14m last year, a 50 per cent drop from
1992, caused by the recession and a shortage of foreign exchange. But
exports for the first half of 1994 were up 180 per cent, mainly due to a
rise in cereal sales.

The main unions in Brazil's vehicle industry went on strike yesterday for an
immediate pay rise, in the first serious threat to a wage freeze introduced
under the government's anti-inflation plan.
Production at all large factories, based in Sao Paulo state, was much
affected. Union officials said nearly half their 150,000 members had stopped
work yesterday morning. Autolatina, Brazil's biggest carmaker and a joint
venture of Volkswagen and Ford, said production had 'almost totally
stopped'.
Anfavea, the car-makers' association, said that, if the strike lasted more
than a few days, it would seriously disrupt sales because demand is high and
stocks are 'non-existent'.
Unions are calling for salaries to be increased monthly so as to make up for
losses in purchasing power through inflation. Such monthly increases were
common before the introduction, on July 1, of Brazil's new currency, the
Real, under the anti-inflation plan. The government has now ruled that wage
increases can only be granted once a year.
Union leaders argue that official inflation indices show an 11.9 per cent
increase since the new currency was launched. They also argue that a 1992
agreement by labour, car-makers and the government guaranteed monthly
increases.
Mr Ciro Gomes, the new finance minister, opposed a compromise by unions and
car-makers which would have allowed a one-off pay increase. He said any rise
had to wait until the unions' annual pay round in April. The government is
concerned that, if car-makers agree to union claims, other sectors will push
for regular pay adjustments. Any rise could also be inflationary since it
would mean higher car prices and increased spending by workers.
The government criticised the strike as 'political' and claimed it was
designed to undermined the Real and the government candidate in the
presidential election next month, Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the finance
minister who hatched the plan.
The strike is led by metalworkers unions linked to the left-wing Workers'
Party of Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Mr Cardoso's main opponent.
Mr Vincente Paulo da Silva, president of the CUT union assembly, denied the
strike was politically linked.

Lotto fever, which has gripped millions of Germans and their foreign
neighbours and caused them to talk of nothing else in recent weeks, subsided
yesterday with news that three groups of Lotto players would share a record
jackpot of DM42m (Pounds 17.3m). After trying for 11 weeks to crack the
burgeoning jackpot, the three so-called Lotto associations crossed the six
correct numbers and had a lottery slip with the magical seventh number which
has so far eluded millions of players. Germany's popular newspapers enjoy
treating their readers to in-depth studies of the new millionaires, but it
was unclear if they would be able to do so today because their identities
remained a mystery. About 3,000 people have become millionaires playing the
weekly Lotto. Until yesterday, the highest payout had been DM16.5m, shared
by two housewives in 1992.

56 per cent of Finnish agricultural land will be eligible for a new special
category of subsidy for the special conditions in the far north, with the
border set at the 62nd parallel. This is six percentage points more than the
Commission originally proposed, but is less than the 64 per cent sought by
Finland. Foreign minister Heikki Haavisto said it was a deal the country
'could live with', although Finland's central union of agricultural
producers rejected the package as inadequate. Finnish support for the EU
ahead of the referendum on October 16 has been falling in recent polls,
partly because of concern about the impact of membership on farmers. The
latest poll shows 38 per cent of Finns favour membership, with 31 per cent
against and 31 per cent undecided.

Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, yesterday kept alive Italy's
hopes of winning 'an important economic portfolio' in the next European
Commission. After meeting Mr Jacques Santer, president-elect of the
Commission, Mr Berlusconi said they had agreed to postpone a formal decision
on Italy's two Commission nominations until it was clear which portfolios
would be available. That means waiting until after the Danish election on
September 21, which should decide whether Mr Henning Christophersen of
Denmark is going to stay on as commissioner responsible for macro-economic
policy. One potential Italian commissioner, Mr Renato Ruggiero, a former
trade minister, now seems certain to become the EU's candidate for head of
the World Trade Organisation, the successor to the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, following an informal meeting of EU foreign ministers at
the weekend.

President Francois Mitterrand said last night he would resign if his
prostate cancer were to make 'me more concerned about my fate than that of
the state'. But he stressed that this was not the case and hoped to finish
his term next May. The ailing 77-year-old French president quipped that he
was 'very flattered' by all the stock market rumours of his demise or
indisposition against which he said he was 'a bit armoured' or inured.
So far, he said, the only interruption to his presidential duties had come
last July when, two days after his second operation, he had had to skip one
cabinet meeting. In a long television interview aimed at clarifying recent
claims and revelations about his health and his association with the Vichy
administration in 1942 and subsequently with some of its members, Mr
Mitterrand said: 'I took the opposite path to most people in moving from
right to left.' His bourgeois background, which he said he shared with 'most
Socialist leaders', had initially inclined him towards conservative
politics, and he admitted he had been 'a bit slow in my evolution' towards
the left.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Unbridgeable hatreds divide Moslem and Serb: Beside the
ancient Visegrad bridge in Serb-held Bosnia, Laura Silber finds old
antagonisms undimmed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amid the destruction of Serb-held Bosnia, the bridge at Visegrad, built more
than 400 years ago, bears witness to the region's Ottoman past. For Bosnian
Serbs, the bridge's 11 arches, spanning the River Drina, represent the
linking of Serb lands. For Moslems, they symbolise Bosnia.
Under an international peace plan, overwhelmingly rejected by the Bosnian
Serbs, the bridge and most of Visegrad, in the south-east near the Serbian
frontier, are designated to the Moslems.
With about 135 international monitors due to be deployed this week on the
frontiers of Serb-held Bosnia and Serbia proper to supervise Belgrade's
embargo, the people of Visegrad are likely to feel even more isolated.
It was in the Drina valley that Serb forces undertook some of their most
brutal operations at the start of the 28-month war. Here Moslems were
expelled and murdered before they even realised that a real war had begun.
These days a heavy silence hangs over Visegrad. On a road slicing through
the wilds of Bosnia, the densely wooded landscape is tainted by a chain of
deserted villages and burned-out houses.
In one hamlet on the road to Visegrad, a smashed minaret on a heap of rubble
testifies to the area's Moslem heritage.
The Serbs of Visegrad cherish the bridge despite the fact that it was built
by Mehmed Pasha Sokolovic, the Ottoman Vezir of Bosnia. After all, explains
Mrs Snezana Kojic, of the town council, Mehmed Pasha was originally an
Orthodox Serb who as a child was kidnapped by the Turks from his home near
the Drina.
She is retelling the Bridge on the River Drina, the novel in which Nobel
prize winner Ivo Andric wove the story of the bridge into four centuries of
Bosnian history.
Andric wrote that the bridge 'formed an indispensable link on the road
between Bosnia and Serbia and further ...'
There is still Turkish script etched in stone in the middle of the 180-metre
structure. Thirteen verses remind travellers that Mehmed Pasha built the
bridge in 1571.
Asked why this Ottoman treasure escaped destruction, Mrs Kojic answered, 'It
connects Serbs on both banks of the Drina.'
'In any case,' she added, 'Mehmed Pasha went back to his Serbian roots when
he came here to build the bridge.'
The legend describes how Mehmed Pasha struggled against evil witches who
undid the work each night until the Vezir immured two Serb children in the
bridge.
For centuries, according to Andric, Moslems and Serbs lived in harmony in
Visegrad - but their world would quickly come apart whenever neighbouring
countries and the Great Powers upset the balance in Bosnia.
Now, having erased almost all traces of Turkish rule, local Serbs say they
will never give up Visegrad.
'We will not accept this plan,' said Mr Drago Gavrilovic, town boss of the
ruling party. Bosnian Serb leaders rejected the proposed maps, which calls
on them to surrender one-third of the 70 per cent of Bosnia they control.
'There are no Moslems left,' he says of Visegrad, where they once made up
nearly two-thirds of the town's 21,000 inhabitants. Despite Mr Gavrilovic's
claims that Serb refugees have brought the population to its pre-war level,
wrecked houses once owned by Moslems remain empty.
On the eve of the war, one Saban Muratovic, a Moslem, took a sledgehammer to
the statue of Andric, which overlooked the bridge. This act, say local
Serbs, started the war.
Soon after war broke out, the Moslems of Visegrad either fled or were
killed. Unconfirmed reports say a paramilitary leader, Vladimir Lukic, led
the slaughter - shooting Moslems throughout the night and dropping their
corpses off the bridge.
Lukic frequents a local cafe on Visegrad's main street. Once named after a
Moslem partisan hero it now bears the name of the Russian Cossack volunteer
brigades who came to Bosnia to fight with the Serbs.
The cafe is the haunt of the new Vezirs of Visegrad - young, battle-scarred
thugs whose dull eyes betray no fear.
Mrs Kojic scoffs at the notion of an international war crimes tribunal. 'Are
we Serbs capable of any crimes?' she asks. In Visegrad, Lukic is a hero.
Andric wrote about the Moslems organising gangs to hunt down Serbs after the
young revolutionary Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Ferdinand in
Sarajevo in 1914 - one of the events which triggered the first world war.
The bridge then separated Moslems and Serbs. 'The bridge remained as if
under sentence of death,' Andric wrote. 'But none the less still whole and
untouched between the two warring sides.' By the end of the novel, however,
as if in a dream, the old Moslem hodja sees 'the ruined bridge, horribly,
cruelly cut in half'.
In Visegrad today the front line and the Moslems are far away. 'We are now
deep into Serb territory,' says Mr Gavrilovic.

<TEXT>
French consumer prices were stable for the third month in succession in
August, giving an annualised inflation rate of 1.7 per cent, according to
Insee, the national statistics office. The figures underline the weakness of
inflationary pressures despite a revival in the economy. The French
economics ministry has revised its forecast of this year's growth in gross
domestic product from 1.4 per cent to 2 per cent. Mr Jean-Claude Trichet,
governor of the Bank of France, said last week that the current growth rate
does not pose inflationary risks, but he said strict budget deficit
reduction policies must be adhered to. The inflation statistics revealed a
decline of 0.6 per cent in the index for food prices and a rise of 0.2 per
cent in private sector manufactured goods.
Slovakia's GDP grew by 5.3 per cent in the second quarter of 1994, the
largest quarterly increase since the end of communism five years ago, the
Slovak Statistics Bureau said yesterday. The increase compares to a fall of
5.1 per cent in the same period last year and growth of 3.6 per cent in the
first quarter this year. Analysts said the pace of growth in the second half
is expected to slow.

Turkey is to ask France to extradite Dursan Karatas, leader of the left-wing

years ago while serving a life sentence. Since their emergence in 1978
Dev-Sol have claimed responsibility for numerous killings; victims include a
former Turkish prime minister, as well as countless police officials.
Karatas was arrested on Friday crossing the French border from Italy with
false papers. Ankara said extradition documentation would be sent to Paris
'in the shortest period possible'. Western countries commonly refuse
extradition requests from countries which impose the death penalty. The
French may require a guarantee that Karatas will not be sentenced to death
before they grant extradition.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Exports fuelling Czech growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Czech Republic has virtually completed the most ambitious mass
privatisation programme in the former communist bloc and has embarked upon
export-led economic growth. But painful restructuring of the newly
privatised companies still lies ahead and the economy requires more foreign
direct investment to penetrate new markets, Mr Vladimir Dlouhy, the minister
for trade and industry said yesterday.
Addressing a Confederation of British Industry conference in London, Mr
Dlouhy said the government now forecast a 2-3 per cent rise in the gross
domestic product this year, fuelled by rapid growth in service industries
and an upturn in industrial output.
Production from Czech factories plummeted 24 per cent with the collapse of
Comecon markets and the start of market reforms in 1991. But industrial
output was up 1.2 per cent in the first seven months of this year and in
July was 4.2 higher than a year earlier. Growth was export-led, spurred by
recovery in the German market which takes around 40 per cent of Czech
exports and is the main source of foreign capital.
Mr Dlouhy identified the combination of the Czech Republic's high skill/low
wage costs and undervalued currency as the economy's main assets. But he
warned that these were essentially short term advantages which would be
eroded over time as living standards rose and the government moved towards
full convertibility of the Czech koruna.
Until now policy makers had concentrated on creating macro-economic
stability rather than growth, and the results can be seen in a balanced
budget, expected single digit inflation this year and low foreign debt of
Dollars 9bn largely offset by the Dollars 6bn held in reserve by the central
bank and commercial banking system, he said.
Structural reforms have been an integral part of macro-economic
stabilisation, including banking system reform and mass privatisation. Mr
Roman Ceska, chairman of the national property fund said that the government
expects to receive a total of CKs240bn (Pounds 5.5bn) from privatisation and
has taken in CKs60bn to date.
'By the start of next year around 80 per cent of the economy will be
privatised. Investment opportunities for foreign investors are now
concentrated among the ranks of the recently privatised companies,' he said.
Shares can be bought through the Prague stock exchange or the electronic RM
small shareholder dealing system, but bigger parcels of shares can be
obtained from the new investment funds which also manage many of the newly
privatised companies and exercise corporate governance, he added.

FT  13 SEP 94 / EU banks warned of Emu costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Top European retail banks would have to spend up to Ecu225m (Pounds 177m)
each to adapt technology and operations for a single European currency,
according to the Ecu Banking Association. The organisation's 90 members
include most large banks in Europe.
In a report published yesterday, it warned that banks in countries not
taking part in the European Monetary Union will face extra costs and
competitive burdens. However, its own research estimates large banks in Emu
countries may have to spend Ecu100m-Ecu150m each to adapt, and costs could
be 50 per cent higher if domestic currencies stay in parallel for a
transition period. A working paper says 'such raw figures could of course
provoke an unnecessarily alarmist reaction' if published. Association
leaders said yesterday they wanted to emphasise the opportunities of Emu,
due to start by 1999.
Mr Walter Damm, chairman of the EBA committee on Emu, said banks in
countries like the UK and Denmark, with opt-out clauses from monetary union,
could face disadvantages because they would lack an Ecu funding base and
would operate in parallel currencies.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Germany ready to defy EU on telecom liberalisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany may allow new telecommunications companies to open their own
networks by the end of 1997, despite strong opposition from state-owned
Deutsche Telekom and national operators in other European Union countries.
In a surprise about-turn, Mr Wolfgang Botsch, post office minister, said
Bonn would consider going it alone if the EU's council of ministers failed
to fix a date for liberalising all EU networks by the end of this year.
A report earlier this year by the EU's Bangemann group on the development of
'information superhighway' services said competition in the provision of
networks was essential to Europe's future competitiveness with the US and
Japan.
The Commission is currently drafting proposals, to be published early next
year, which would open telecoms network infrastructure to competition at the
same time as telecoms services.
Basic phone services are set to be opened to competition in January 1998
across most of the EU. That would also become the date for infrastructure
competition if EU ministers support the Commission.
A Commission official said Mr Botsch's statement was an 'important first
step' towards persuading vested interests - notably state-owned telecoms
companies - to accept the inevitability of early infrastructure competition.
Mr Botsch, who had previously insisted the 12 EU states should move together
and grant open access to networks one or two years after the 1998 services
deadline, said Deutsche Telekom needed to be able to plan clearly.
Although accepting that other member states would be defensive, he was now
inclined to give up both monopolies simultaneously, he told the Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung.
However, the move is still strongly opposed by Deutsche Telekom, which is
preoccupied with the privatisation of the company due to start in early
1996.
Mr Rolf-Dieter Leister, chairman of Deutsche Telekom's supervisory board,
told the Suddeutsche Zeitung: 'I certainly do not represent the view that
Germany should become the front-runner in European telecoms liberalisation.'
Mr Leister, Telekom's most senior non-executive, made plain that Telekom
management, preparing for the transition to a joint stock company next
January, was hampered by the need for all important decisions to be approved
at the political level.
Telekom's mandate had to be made clear now for the benefit of future
shareholders, he said. It was especially important that the enterprise
should be able to establish foreign subsidiaries and appoint top managers
without Mr Botsch's having the final say.
Meanwhile management needed to be clear on the scope and timing of domestic
liberalisation moves: 'Will the minister license corporate networks? How
will he deal with alternative networks? What will happen with broad-band
cable? How will mobile telephones develop in future?' he asked.
Telekom is especially anxious about pressure on the minister from power
utilities who want licences to start using their internal systems in 1996 to
offer data transmission services to the public and other industries,
effectively breaching Telekom's network monopoly.
The UK has allowed competition in telecoms infrastructure for a decade, and
the Netherlands is set to follow suit following the partial privatisation of
its state operator earlier this year.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Maltese resist plans for VAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GODFREY GRIMA
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VALLETTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Malta's plan to introduce value added tax in 1995, part of its bid to join
the European Union, has met opposition from the island's business community,
trade unions and opposition Labour party.
The introduction of VAT is part of the centre-right Nationalist government's
programme of market liberalisation which includes cutting state subsidies,
removing tariffs and ending state monopolies.
The prime minister, Mr Eddie Fenech Adami, has pledged this by 1996 with two
objectives: first, to help develop the island as a financial centre to make
up for the decline in traditional industries and manufacturing; and
secondly, more controversially, to strengthen the country's bid for full
membership of the EU.
The EU issued an encouraging avis last October which recognised Malta's
desire to join the club but warned that reforms would be needed, including
the restructuring of the island's tax system.
Spearheading the campaign against the introduction of these reforms are the
island's unions and the opposition Labour party, which opposes the EU bid.
The unions fear VAT will mean high prices, and they accuse the government of
rushing blindly to meet Brussels' demands for economic convergence.
State revenues have been heavily dependent on duties on imported goods,
which are sometimes rated at more than 100 per cent. The rate of VAT will be
15 per cent on a wide range of goods and services, but excluding food and
medical services. The government insists there will be no cost-of-living
rises. Inflation, fuelled by a devaluation two years ago, is about 5 per
cent.
The General Workers Union, which has 43,000 members (or more than 30 per
cent of the country's workforce) has already carried out industrial action
in protest at the VAT plans. The General Retailers and Traders Union, which
has 5,000 card-carrying members but boasts the support of 35,000, has also
threatened disruptions unless the rate of tax is brought down.
While it is unlikely parliament's ruling on VAT will be overturned, more
sensitive issues lurk round the corner. The reform of Maltese industry,
which has enjoyed a high degree of protection, will be especially painful.
Small companies involved in construction and furniture making, which account
for 70 per cent of industrial employment, hide behind stringent tariff and
non-tariff barriers, and the shipbuilding sector, which provides 5 per cent
of employment, is heavily subsidised.
Other pending reforms include a new banking law which will abolish off-shore
accounts to create the sameconditions for locals and foreigners alike, and a
privatisation programme. Both are likely to provoke opposition.
Along with looking for a role in Europe, the reforms are aimed at developing
Malta as a financial and trading centre. It is hoped financial services
could account for 10 to 15 per cent of GDP within five years if the reform
programme is allowed to go ahead.
Ironically, however, the main threat to Malta's EU membership bid comes not
from domestic opposition to the reforms but from the EU itself. EU members
are resisting extending the current principle of the veto in voting to such
small entities - Malta's GNP is 0.03 per cent that of the EU.
No progress is likely until 1996, when the EU will discuss the issue of
enlargement.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Nato begins exercise in Poland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Nato began its first exercises on ex-Warsaw Pact territory yesterday on a
sports field near Poznan in Poland, as much a public relations reassurance
for eastern Europe and Russia as serious military training.
Forces from the US, Ukraine, Britain and Bulgaria took part in the exercise,
part of the Nato 'Partnership for Peace' initiative designed to involve
eastern European countries in western security structures without granting
them full Nato membership.
Some 600 troops from six Nato and seven PFP countries are involved in the
exercise, codenamed Co-operative Bridge 94. Its main thrust is to develop
peacekeeping skills among small groups, rather than co-ordinate large
movements of armour.
While Nato's focus is increasingly on peacekeeping, this type of exercise is
less provocative to Russian sensibilities, still jangled by the thought of
Nato forces training on old Warsaw Pact ground.
The Russians were conspicuously absent from the ragged band of soldiers at
attention on Biedrusko field as Polish military bands played the anthems of
the 13 participants.
General George Joulwan, Nato's supreme allied commander in Europe, called it
'a truly historic occasion, as five years ago you were parted by the Iron
Curtain and today you come to train together'.
Partnership for Peace aims to increase east European and Nato forces'
ability to work alongside one another, but falls short of offering the
mutual defence guarantees Nato members enjoy and many east European states
want. Such tensions showed in official statements at the exercise.
'The PFP leads straight to an independent decision to full integration and
membership in Nato,' Mr Piotr Kolodziejczyk, a former Warsaw Pact officer
and now Poland's defence minister, said yesterday.
This is a position which Nato has yet fully to accept. The Russians, despite
joining PFP, remain afraid it will dilute their special power status in
relations with the US. Equally, the exercise is less than the Poles had
wanted in initial talks about a scenario aimed at having Nato forces coming
to aid a country attacked by a foreign power.
Instead, the exercises involve the more everyday tasks peace-keeping forces
might have to perform. For the next four days, young men (and women in the
US contingent) communicating in English, will practise searching vehicles at
control points, crossing rivers while escorting refugees, and patrolling
disputed areas.
Partnership for Peace has been criticised by leading Polish politicians as
unsatisfactory, providing no real security guarantee. Poland's complaints
that PFP does not go far enough have produced varying reactions in Germany,
the main west European advocate of forming links with the east.
Led by Mr Volker Ruhe, Germany's defence minister, one school has argued
that Poland must be granted full Nato membership by the end of the decade.
Others, mainly in the German Foreign Ministry, think it would be provocative
to Moscow if such a deadline were set while Russia is still absorbing the
effects of its withdrawal from east Europe. Still, the splits over how far
west Europe should guarantee eastern security seemed far from the minds of
onlookers in Poznan.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, yesterday warned his governing
Christian Democratic Union coalition not to become complacent in the run-up
to the federal elections on October 16. 'The election is not yet won and we
have no votes to lend,' he said.
Mr Kohl was speaking in Bonn after provisional election results showed
another absolute and increased majority for the CDU in the eastern German
state of Saxony. Its share of the vote rose from 53.8 per cent to 58.1 per
cent while that of the opposition Social Democrats fell by nearly three
percentage points to 16.6 per cent.
However, the CDU in Brandenburg had its share of the vote reduced by nearly
11 percentage points to 18.7 per cent, while the vote for the Social
Democrats rose from 38.2 per cent to 54.1 per cent.
Mr Kohl's warning was prompted by the disastrous showing of the Free
Democrats, the junior partner in the governing coalition, which failed to
reach the minimum 5 per cent required to enter the state parliaments.
Mr Werner Hoyer, chairman of the FDP, said the results in Brandenburg and
Saxony were 'untypical. The FDP believes the low turnouts of under 60 per
cent damaged the party but helped the Party of Democratic Socialism, the
successor to the former east German communist party and now the third
largest party in eastern Germany, holding between 16 and 18 per cent of the
vote in Brandenburg and Saxony.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Russia draws up legislation to regulate monopoly industries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian government is preparing radical legislation to regulate monopoly
industries, such as energy and utilities, which threaten to distort the
country's fragile economy. The law will aim to protect the consumer,
counteract inflationary pressures, and help ease the inter-enterprise debts
crisis.
The draft law, which will be introduced to parliament this autumn, envisages
the creation of several powerful independent regulatory agencies to police
the natural monopolies - defined as 'commodity markets in which demand is
effectively satisfied in the absence of any competition'. The draft law
covers oil and gas pipelines, the production and transmission of
electricity, rail and air transport, and public utilities, such as
telecommunications.
Officials worry that monopoly abuses in these 'commanding heights' could
damage the development of the broader economy. The fear is that such
monopolies can stifle the emergence of effective competition and push
through price rises fuelling inflation and worsening inter-enterprise debts.
The mass privatisation programme, which has transferred 85 per cent of the
country's enterprises into private ownership, has concentrated enormous
economic power in the hands of a few industrial managers but has not yet
stimulated sufficient competition to check their ambitions.
The federal agencies would have considerable powers to devise and implement
suitable regulatory frameworks for each targeted sector and would report to
the government every year. They would be responsible for supervising all
transactions affecting a natural monopoly's position in the marketplace and
any share purchases in other enterprises. They would also scrutinise big
capital investment projects and any sales or transfers of assets.
Under the proposed legislation, the regulators would have unrestricted
access to information affecting the natural monopolies and would have
considerable powers of enforcement. They could reverse any act deemed to be
illegal and could impose fines or penalties on companies infringing the law.
The agencies will contain up to seven members who are specialists in the
appropriate field. The head of a federal agency would be appointed for a
three-year term by the president on the government's recommendation. They
would take over responsibility for regulating the natural monopolies from
various ministries.
The development of such a potentially stiff regulatory regime is bound to
spark a heated debate. Some economists - and more self-interested industrial
managers - have argued that monopoly powers are essential in the early
stages of capitalist development to ensure companies can amass sufficient
profits to reinvest in big infrastructure projects.
But one western economist welcomed the principle of stricter regulation and
a more effective competition policy. 'In countries which are trying to shed
a tradition of collusive behaviour it is particularly important to take
steps to change the ground rules and create a real framework for competition
rather than collusion,' the economist said. 'But it will be critical to see
how quickly and how well they can follow through with it, given a lot of
interested parties will be opposed to arms-length regulation.'

FT  13 SEP 94 / Light cast on secrets of EU ministers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A shaft of light fell across the secretive deliberations of the European
Council yesterday with the release in London of partial details on more than
200 single market decisions taken in the five years to last December.
The records, which the EU has refused to publish, show that 91 of 233 single
market decisions taken in secret by ministers were forced through against
the wishes of one or more member states under the qualified majority voting
system. The council - the most powerful EU institution, made up of EU heads
of government - legislates in secret, and has resisted attempts to force
disclosure of its deliberations under the union's open government rules.
Its reticence is being challenged in the European Court in an action backed
by the European parliament following the formal rejection of attempts by
newspapers to obtain voting records.
However, Mr Harry Barnes, a British Labour MP, has obtained details of
single market decisions from January 1993 through a parliamentary question
tabled in the British House of Commons.
Mr Richard Needham, UK trade minister, reveals in a letter to Mr Barnes that
142 single market provisions over the five-year period were adopted
unanimously. Mr Needham does not give details of the alliances between
member states in the 91 cases in which a vote was required. Nor does he say
whether any proposals were withdrawn without being put to a vote.
However, he discloses that the UK was on the winning side in 66 of the
contested votes, abstained 17 times, and was outvoted eight times.
The key British defeats were on regulations abolishing controls on passenger
baggage on flights and sea crossings, on food quality control, and on
transport issues such as the length of articulated lorries.
Other member states failed to get their way on a range of more important
issues, including directives on company law, public procurement, television
broadcasting, life assurance services, partnership law and
telecommunications.
The council appears determined to prevent further breaches of its secrecy by
arguing before the European Court that decision making could be paralysed by
a public right to know details of the negotiating stances of member states.
In a submission to the court, the council has urged the judges to ignore
declarations at EU summits in favour of greater transparency, arguing that
such statements had no binding effect.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Swedish exporters warn of election threat to investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The chiefs of Sweden's four top exporting companies joined forces yesterday
to warn that their planned domestic investments of up to SKr50bn (Pounds
4.27bn) a year were at risk if the ground rules for industry - including
income tax levels - were changed for the worse after Sunday's general
election.
The intervention by the executives, whose companies together account for a
third of the country's exports and whose combined annual turnover last year
exceeded SKr250bn, was considered highly unusual for Sweden.
In a joint newspaper article clearly aimed mainly at the opposition Social
Democratic party, the heads of Volvo, Ericsson, the forestry group Stora and
the local division of the Swiss-Swedish engineering giant ABB said their
companies together planned annual investment at home or abroad of SKr40bn to
SKr50bn over the next five years.
'With today's conditions, Sweden is an attractive choice. But uncertainty
over labour market and economic policies, and the constancy with which they
are applied, can hinder essential decision-making in a harmful way for
Sweden,' said the article in Dagens Nyheter, the country's biggest-selling
broadsheet.
The four company chiefs - Mr Soren Gyll, chief executive of Volvo; Mr Lars
Ramqvist, chief executive of Ericsson; Mr Bert-Olof Svanholm, chief
executive of Swedish ABB; and Mr Bo Berggren, chairman of Stora - said the
recent surge in profitability and competitiveness in Swedish industry
wrought by sound government policies must not be upset. They called on
policymakers to tackle the budget deficit and stabilise the fast-growing
public debt.
They also warned strongly that any increase in marginal income taxes would
damage Swedish competitiveness.
'Marginal taxes over 50 per cent (the present level) would seriously reduce
our attractiveness to recruits,' they wrote.
The Social Democrats, who are expected in Sunday's poll to oust the
right-centre coalition of Mr Carl Bildt, prime minister, have proposed
cutting corporate tax as part of measures to stimulate investment. But they
plan to raise marginal income taxes through a 5 per cent 'emergency' tax and
increase capital gains, wealth and dividend taxes.
The intervention had an immediate impact on the election campaign. Mr Bildt,
desperate to close the gap on a weakening Social Democratic lead in the
opinion polls, welcomed the article, saying it showed that Social Democratic
policies threatened industry and employment.
But Social Democratic officials close to Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the party
leader, dismissed it as crude election propaganda. Mr Carlsson said the
party did not intend changing the basic income tax levels set in 1990.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Mortgage lenders raise cost of loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two of the UK's largest mortgage lenders - Nationwide Building Society and
Abbey National - responded to the base rate rise with increases in their
variable home loan rates. Many other lenders signalled they would be
announcing rises shortly.
As they did so, a range of organisations and associations, including estate
agents, housebuilders and lenders themselves, expressed anxiety that the
increase would damage the uncertain recovery in the housing market. Halifax
Building Society, the UK's largest mortgage lender, said an increase in its
rates was 'almost inevitable'. It plans to make an announcement within the
week.
But Woolwich Building Society, the UK's third largest, said the base rate
increase should not result in an increase in its mortgage and investment
rates. Mr Peter Robinson, Woolwich managing director, described the rises
from other lenders as 'a regrettable knee jerk reaction'.
Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, said
that at the very least the interest rate rise put back any recovery in the
housing market until next year.
However, individual organisations within the council, which represents
banks, societies and other lenders, were divided about how the rise would
affect the housing market.
Mr Brian Davis, chief executive of Nationwide, the UK's second - largest
society, which raised its basic variable rate by 0.4 per cent, said that as
the increase was expected at some point, he hoped it would not have too much
impact.
At Abbey National, which announced a 0.35 per cent rise in its standard
variable rate, Mr Charles Toner, managing director of the group's retail
division, similarly sought to play down the effect of the rise. But Halifax
said the rate rise would certainly damage confidence, and other lenders said
the timing - at the start of the important autumn sales period - was
particularly unfortunate. This gloomier view was reflected by Ocea, an
organisation representing 26 of the largest corporate estate agency chains.
Meanwhile, shares of house builders who had reported a rise in in new house
sales in August fell yesterday. Barratt fell 14p to 197, Beazer Homes fell
6p to 139p while Wilson Bowden shares dropped 11p to 397p.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Clarke lifts base rates half a point: Markets stay calm
after anti-inflation increase to 5.75%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, GILLIAN TETT and PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, moved to nip inflationary pressures in
the bud by announcing a half-percentage-point increase in bank base rates to
5.75 per cent yesterday.
It was the first officially inspired rise in rates for nearly five years and
more than reversed February's controversial quarter-point cut, which pegged
base rates at the unusually low level of 5.25 per cent for the past seven
months.
Yesterday's decision, signalled by an increase in the Bank of England's
minimum lending rate at the start of money market dealings, promises to be
no less controversial.
Marking a decisive turn in the UK interest-rate cycle, Mr Clarke's
announcement disappointed business organisations and came as the City had
all but convinced itself that last Wednesday's monetary meeting between the
chancellor and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, had decided
to leave rates unchanged. For the first time in living memory, a UK
government has acted to tighten monetary conditions while retail price
inflation is low.
A buoyant Mr Clarke said he decided to raise rates 'to take no risks with
inflation' at a time of strong economic growth.
His action was welcomed by financial markets. The pound jumped 1 1/2
pfennigs and more than a cent on the news before trading steadily for the
rest of the day. On the Liffe futures exchange, the December long gilt
future rose to 100 1/32 in late trading, up  27/32 points on the day.
Even the equity market responded positively after an initial downward lurch.
The FT-SE 100 index made up more than half an early 25-point loss to finish
10.5 points down at 3,128.8.
Pledging to keep the recovery 'healthy and lasting', the chancellor said UK
output was growing at its fastest rate for six years, with exports at record
levels and investment rising. Underlying inflation, at 2.2 per cent in July,
was at a 27-year low.
'My overriding aim now is to make sure that this healthy growth can be
sustained to deliver higher living standards and more jobs. So often in the
past, accelerating inflation has prevented us from enjoying sustained
growth,' he said. 'We would have jeopardised everything if we had sat about
in the face of these very strong figures and decided we were not going to
act.'
However, at a Treasury press conference, the chancellor admitted the rate
rise was 'finely judged'. He and Mr George were 'poised' to raise rates
after meeting last week but decided to take two days to reflect before the
final decision, taken around Friday lunchtime.
The decisive factor was last month's disclosure that the economy had been
growing much faster than thought in the first half of the year. That
overcame reservations based on more recent indicators hinting at a slowdown
in consumer demand.
Earlier yesterday, the Central Statistical Office published official
producer price figures providing one of the first indications of pending
inflationary pressures.
The price of goods leaving factories rose last month in most manufacturing
sectors.
The rate rise - the first since October 1989, apart from a one-day jump on
Black Wednesday in September 1992 - was welcomed by City analysts for
injecting a new element of credibility into government economic policy.
Business and trade union leaders were less happy. Mr Richard Brown, deputy
director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said there was 'no
justification' for the rise and warned it 'may sabotage' much of the
recovery.
Mr Graham Mackenzie, director-general of the Engineering Employers'
Federation, said it was disappointing and risked 'stifling the recovery'. Mr
Bill Morris, general secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union,
said pay claims would reflect higher borrowing costs.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Chancellor rules out prospect of early tax cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke yesterday dismissed any prospect of tax cuts in his
November Budget despite the shadow cast over next month's Conservative party
conference by the rise in interest rates.
In a move that will dash remaining hopes among Tory MPs of a significant
upturn in the government's political fortunes this autumn, Mr Clarke said
there was 'no chance' of lower taxes while the government was borrowing
Pounds 30bn a year.
Yesterday's base rate rise and the chancellor's curt rejection of recent
speculation that he might find room for a small income tax cut clashed
awkwardly with the launch of the agenda for the annual party conference.
Mr Jeremy Hanley, the party chairman, inadvertently showed his anxiety about
the impact on Tory morale by voicing hopes that there would be no further
increase in borrowing costs.
Still unsettled by the political row following his weekend 'gaffe' over law
and order, Mr Hanley broke with the carefully scripted official response to
comment: 'What we have to do is make sure that this interest rate rise is
it.'
With the Tories trailing Labour by more than 30 points in the opinion polls,
the conference agenda reflects growing discontent among local activists over
the government's handling of the economy.
It includes a series of demands from constituency associations for tax cuts
and the scrapping of the planned doubling next April of value added tax on
domestic fuel.
Ministers acknowledged that the strength of the recovery shown by the latest
batch of indicators has yet to be reflected in a 'feel-good' factor among
voters.
Their fear is that higher interest rates and the round of further tax rises
due in the coming months will further damage the government's standing.
But Mr Clarke, in characteristically robust form at a Treasury press
conference, coupled a reaffirmation of the government's medium-term
commitment to lower taxation with a rejection of any early tax cuts.
He acknowledged that public borrowing this year might be below the
Treasury's latest Pounds 36bn forecast, but said it was still expected to be
more than Pounds 30bn. Against that background, 'talk of tax reductions in
November is hopelessly premature. No chance'.
Some ministerial colleagues believe the chancellor was pushed into his rate
move by Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England. They want Mr
Clarke to take a stronger line against the bank's 'over-cautious' stance.

hotel chain - Other companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Air France will today end weeks of uncertainty by announcing the identity of
the new owner of Meridien, its luxury hotel chain. Meridien is being courted
by competing bids from France's Accor and the UK's Forte.
Air France says it will sell Meridien to the highest bidder which means
Forte could win as it has bid FFr1.8bn (Dollars 330m) against Accor's
FFr1.6bn.
However, the French group has lobbied hard behind the scenes trying to swing
the deal through its political influence and commercial clout as one of Air
France's partners.

FT  12 SEP 94 / World looks away as a sea vanishes: The environmental
catastrophe of the shrinking Aral Sea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On most summer nights three decades ago, a barge would dock at a tiny
Uzbekistan fishing village, called 'Tiger's Tail' by the locals because of
the way the spit of land arose in the southern Aral Sea. A makeshift screen
would go up aboard the vessel, and bored fishermen would take a seat under
the stars to watch a nightly offering of Soviet and foreign films.
Today, ships like the old film barge stand askew, rusting in a dry harbour.
Mangled fishing nets lie half-buried in the sand while the fishermen weave
carpets, make bricks and tend livestock. The reason is simple: the village,
whose real name is Uchsay, is now 50 miles from Aral's former southern
shore.
In a region of 3.7m people, Uchsay's 32 families are victims of an
environmental disaster, one that scientists now believe may not begin to
abate until the middle of the next century: the slow disappearance of the
world's fourth largest inland body of water.
The scale of the disaster has become so acute, and the local and
international response to it so meagre, that once-hopeful western scientists
are now looking merely to treat a resulting regional health crisis.
Meanwhile, the soil in important surrounding farm regions of Uzbekistan,
Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan has become so saline that the vital local cotton
harvest - whose rapid increase was a main factor in causing the problem -
has itself been shrinking.
'There's not enough water to stabilise the sea,' says Professor Philip
Micklin of Western Michigan University, the west's leading expert on the
Aral. 'Maybe some time 50 years from now there may be enough water to bring
it back. But I don't see them making the economic changes necessary in the
next several decades to rehabilitate the sea.'
The Aral sea began shrinking in the early 1960s, when the Soviet Union
irrigated a hugely expanded Uzbekistan's cotton crop by diverting the feeder
Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers from the Aral, whose length then measured
about 220 miles.
Uzbekistan did become the world's third-largest cotton producer, growing 5m
tonnes a year, but then local people began noticing the Aral's shores
receding.
Today it covers half its former area, and has divided into northern and
southern seas. By the end of the decade, according to forecasts, the sea
will shrink to one-third its historic size and split again, creating
northern, eastern and western bodies.
'We still had the sea at the beginning of the 1970s - it was navy blue,'
says Ms Marinika Babanazarova, director of a cultural museum in the
Uzbekistan regional capital of Nukus. 'Then it began disappearing, very
quickly. We lost it before our very eyes.'
The health consequences have been severe. Doctors say lung disease and
tuberculosis are rife.
'One hundred per cent of our pregnant women have anaemia, and most give
birth prematurely,' says Dr Andrew Vervihost, director of the mother and
child unit at the Karakulpak Institute of Clinical Medicine, in Nukus.
Infant mortality in Uzbekistan's region of Karakulpakstan, bordering the
Aral, has soared.
The scrawny cotton fields in the Uzbekistan village of Qaxiakiyakla
illustrate the agricultural impact. 'Twenty years ago, the cotton came up to
here on me,' says Mr Arzamurat Arzanov, placing a hand even with the centre
of his shirt. Now the crop on Mr Arzanov's farm rises only to his shins.
Uzbekistan appears to have shifted more planting to other areas as
Karakulpakstan's yield has plummeted, so its cotton harvest has been stable
in recent years at about 4m tonnes.
But the Aral fishing industry - the former northern port of Aralskon on the
Kazakhstan coastline once accounted for 10 per cent of the Soviet Union's
entire catch - has been eviscerated.
International attention to the Aral began during the Gorbachev era, but
little organised assistance has come. Central Asia's governments, meanwhile,
have behaved as though they have written off the sea. In March 1993, all
committed themselves to depositing 1 per cent of their state budget into the
'Aralbank', a fund they created to resolve the disaster, but western and
local officials say no money has yet gone into the account.
Environmentalists now are focusing on cleaning up the Amu Darya, which,
though little of it now spills into the Aral Sea, still provides most
regional drinking water. The idea is to stop current practices in which raw
sewage is dumped into its waters, along with tonnes of pesticides.
Mr Khojamurat Khoshimov, whose father operated the former film barge up and
down the Aral coast, stands on a bluff overlooking the old fishing village
of Uchsay. He says most of his neighbours have moved away.
Though he does not expect the waters soon to return to Uchsay's shores, he
will stay put. 'No one wants to say his city is dying,' he says.
So, with few alternatives, Mr Khoshimov has gone into his father's business,
with one small adjustment - his mobile cinema plies local villages in a car.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Assad's speech lifts Israeli peace hopes: Signs of progress
on Golan Heights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel yesterday hailed a statement by Syrian President Hafez al-Assad,
saying it was aimed at preparing the Syrian public for peace. At the same
time there was growing optimism in the Jewish state of an imminent
breakthrough in stalled peace negotiations.
In a speech to the newly elected Syrian parliament on Saturday Mr Assad said
peace with Israel was a strategic option and he was willing to work towards
peace and 'meet the objective requirements that are agreed upon'.
Mr Itamar Rabinovich, chief Israeli negotiator with Syria, said: 'It's first
and foremost a speech preparing public opinion in Syria.'
Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said Mr Assad had 'declared he
has a strategy of peace. . . and there were more than hints that he
understands that peace truly means peace, that is to say normalisation of
relations'.
Israeli officials say privately that significant progress has been made in
US-brokered negotiations over the return of the occupied Golan Heights in
return for full peace, and both governments have now entered a period of
preparing their publics for a deal.
Mr Uri Savir, Foreign Ministry director-general, said yesterday that US
secretary of state Warren Christopher would return to the region this month
or next and that US officials were optimistic about a substantial
breakthrough.
However, Israeli optimism has yet to be matched in public in Damascus, and
Mr Assad reiterated Syria's unconditional demand for a full Israeli
withdrawal from the Heights - a demand unacceptable, so far, to Israel and
the traditional stumbling block in talks.
Last week Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, presented for the first
time a plan for a partial withdrawal from the Golan, backed by US military
assistance, followed by a three-year trial period marked by normalisation,
including setting up embassies. Mr Rabin said that only after the
normalisation period would Israel negotiate the line of its final withdrawal
from the Heights.
The move was immediately rejected by Syria as unacceptable but Israeli
officials say the Rabin plan was an opening gambit meant partly to test
Israeli public opinion. They said that by comparing the deal to Israel's
phased 26-month withdrawal from the Egyptian Sinai between 1980 and 1982 Mr
Rabin was also hinting that a similar deal with Damascus would culminate in
full withdrawal.
Mr Rabin's plan opened a fierce public debate in Israel between proponents
and opponents on territorial withdrawal from the Golan. On Saturday
thousands of Jewish settlers on the Golan held a mass rally to kick off a
campaign of uncompromising but non-violent civil disobedience they say will
be 'the battle for the Golan'.
In Mr Rabin's governing Labour party eight parliamentarians have demanded
that any territorial compromise secure a 70-vote majority in the 120-member
parliament. The dovish wing of the party has called for a reform of Labour's
platform by erasing clauses which support Israeli sovereignty of the Golan.
Mr Rabin has met both initiatives with stern warnings against breaking party
discipline.
Ultimately Mr Rabin hopes to deflate the public and party battle by not
dismantling any Jewish settlements in the meantime and by putting any
substantial withdrawal to a national referendum after elections in 1996.
A recent opinion poll conducted by Haifa University showed at least 64 per
cent of Israelis support at least a partial withdrawal in exchange for full
peace with Syria. The poll showed that 27 per cent supported full withdrawal
and that many people had become more favourable to territorial compromise
over the past year.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of The Philippines (12): More anchor at Subic -
Industrial estates are reflecting economic revival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The economic recovery of the past two years has stirred activity in various
parts of the country, particularly in the industrial estates being put up to
capture investment flows.
The most notable is the Subic Special Economic and Freeport Zone, which is
rising from the former US naval base along Subic Bay on the western fringe
of the main island of Luzon.
Since its conversion into an industrial estate in November 1992, the Subic
zone has signed up 73 companies to set up a range of industrial and
commercial operations within the 6,000-hectare facility. Of these, 44 have
actually started operations.
The Subic estate sits between a deep natural harbour opening up to the South
China Sea and a mountain range. These features, industrial planners say,
make the facility an ideal anchorage.
Having been a jump-off point for American military operations in the region,
the zone has an airport, shipping berths and a well-maintained road network,
along with fully-operating utilities (power station, telecommunications,
water and sewerage systems) and structures that can quickly be converted
into warehouses, residential buildings and offices.
All these make the area ideal for investors in a hurry. Its location also
makes it suitable for ventures aiming at the Asian market.
Subic's twin military base, Clark Field, located to its east in the central
Luzon province of Pampanga, has also seen increased interest in recent
months. Thirty-five companies have formalised deals with the Clark
Development Corporation to set up shop in the zone.
Clark is initially developing a core area of 4,440ha, of which 1,620ha have
been roped off to become an aviation centre and another 1,020ha for
industry. The project will be expanded by another 23,600ha to accommodate
light and medium industrial and agro-industrial ventures.
The aviation complex will include an international airport, to be developed
from the facility left behind the US air force that withdrew from the area
just before the June 1991 eruption of nearby Mount Pinatubo.
Like Subic, the Clark industrial estate offers locaters immediate
infrastructure facilities, including a power plant, telecommunications and a
water system.
Incentives await locaters in Subic and Clark. There is exemption from taxes
and duties on all imports of capital goods, machinery, raw materials and
finished goods; exemption from local and national taxes except for a final 5
per cent corporate tax on gross income; and tax holidays of four to six
years.
A highway to link the two industrial zones with metropolitan Manila is near
completion, and will reduce travel time within the area.
Closer to metropolitan Manila are the privately-run industrial parks that
have sprouted in the Calabarzon area, which groups the five provinces
surrounding the national capital - Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and
Quezon. In 1990, the government designated regional industrial centres
(RICs) in each of the 12 regional groupings outside metropolitan Manila,
leading to the Calabarzon concept.
The Calabarzon project aims to create a business corridor south and east of
the national capital, to capture the city's overspill population without
causing additional poverty and other social problems.
The corridor has a combined land area of nearly 16,230 square kilometres, or
5.4 per cent of the whole Philippine land area, and a population of 6.35m.
It is already accommodates a range of manufacturing operations set up by big
US, Japanese, South Korean and European groups.
The area also has an industrial base composed of oil refineries;
manufacturing operations in industrial gases, non-alcoholic beverages, paper
products, flour and feeds, metal products and other consumer goods;
shipbuilding; food processing; and power generation.
Among the first industrial estates that are now offered to investors are:
Dasmarinas Industrial Estate, Gateway Business Park, GMA Industrial Estate,
Cavite Industrial City, Laguna International Industrial Park, Laguna
Technopark, Light Industry and Science Park of the Philippines, along with
the government-run Cavite Export Processing Zone.
Farther out of the capital, the government has identified the following
growth centres:
The Cagayan-Iligan corridor, in northern Mindanao, which is being developed
as a heavy industrial centre, and a major agro-industrial and trade centre
in view of its access to hydro-power sources and industrial base.
el,3.5
The north-west Luzon quadrangle, said to be a potential financial centre and
tourist haven, given its proximity to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea and Japan.
The Cotabato-Davao-Zamboanga crescent, which is being promoted as an
agribusiness centre to become a major exporter of fresh and processed food
and other products.
The Panay-Negros pole, in the central Philippines, now being developed for
light and medium manufacturing activities specialising in furniture,
jewellery, toys, handicrafts, kitchen and hardware.
The Leyte-Samar zone, also in the central Philippines, which is being
considered as another heavy industry centre, because of its access to
geothermal and hydro-power sources.
The west-central Luzon zone and baselands, which may be tapped to specialise
in ship and aircraft manufacturing and repair, warehousing and
transshipment, defence industries, and other light-to-medium industries.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of The Philippines (13): The business visitor fares
best - The tourism industry's struggle to overcome a number of obstacles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Tourism in the Philippines might be described as optimism in the face of
adversity.
Superficially, there is every reason for visitors to be deterred. Until the
late-1980s, the political climate was unstable. Continuing 'internal
security' problems - from the activities of Muslim separatists in the
southern island of Mindanao, to random street crime - attract enough
international attention to give the Philippines a serious image problem.
Countries like the UK or Australia still provide consular advice notices to
travellers, despite requests from Filipino government officials to have
these warnings lifted.
The country also encounters more than its fair share of natural disasters.
Parts of the northern Luzon region, for example, were badly affected by the
1991 earthquake, in which over 2,000 people died.
Even in Manila's grander hotels, visitors will find that the standard fire
notices carry a separate, equally prominent, warning about earthquakes. 'If
unable to go down the stairs, go up to the roof,' reads one soothing, if
unhelpful, message.
The country averages over a dozen typhoons in a good year, some of which
have caused major damage in potential tourist centres in the Visayas.
If these factors fail to deter the more intrepid traveller, there is the
paucity of infrastructure, which is more annoying that exhilarating. In the
early-1990s, power-cuts were a feature of everyday life. Telephone
communications can still be erratic, and a trip around Metro Manila, the
country's major urban centre, means one long traffic-jam.
Yet, despite all of these obstacles, the Philippines is plainly aware of the
benefits which a flourishing tourist trade can bring, and is keen to play up
its limited gains. In 1993, 1.4m visitors arrived in the country, a 19 per
cent improvement on the previous year. The percentage gain in 1992 was of
the same order.
According to Mr Vicente Carlos, secretary at the department of tourism
(DoT), the country now seeks to attract around 1.65m visitors in 1994, and
2m in 1995. He takes comfort from the fact that the most recent monthly
figures - for May - showed that around 100,000 people arrived, a record
number for what is traditionally a lean month.
But while these statistics may provide grounds for encouragement, they
should also be kept in perspective. For a start, the Philippines is moving
off an exceptionally low base. Other centres in the Asia-Pacific region, for
example, notch up many times these numbers. Hong Kong, tiny in comparison,
attracts around 10m visitors a year.
Moreover, it is not entirely clear how many of the 1.4m arrivals in 1993
were 'expatriate' Filipinos returning to see their families. Just under
one-fifth of visitors emanate from the US. According to the DoT in Manila,
anyone holding a US 'green card' counts as an 'overseas worker', and only
Filipinos who have taken up US citizenship should fall into the North
American visitor category. But no one believes that these niceties are
scrupulously observed.
Nevertheless, as Mr Vicente stresses, 1993's 1.4m figure does better
anything the Philippines has achieved in the past. Moreover, he claims that
departmental statistics show that visitors average a fairly lengthy nine-day
stay, and spend quite highly during that time. This, he says, makes tourism
the second largest earner of foreign exchange for the Philippines - after
remittances from overseas workers. The industry accounts for about 5 per
cent of gross domestic product.
Clearly, the relatively stable political climate has been one major factor
in improving the sector's fortunes. Basic infrastructure improvements, like
the more secure electricity supply, are another.
A third, and less self-evident, reason for the upturn may be the fact that
tourists can now skirt Manila, and take direct international flights into
provincial cities like Cebu. Apart from a sleazy sex industry and an
intriguing golf-course built over the moat of the old walled town, Manila
has little to offer the overseas visitor who is there for reasons other than
business. Its international terminal, while functional, is discouragingly
dilapidated; the domestic terminal is accepted as a national disgrace.
Business travellers are better served: the Makati district, the city's main
financial and commercial centre, has recently added a number of new luxury
hotels, while the old-established Peninsular is undergoing renovation.
Asked what the Philippines can capitalise on as it pursues the tourism road,
Mr Vicente points to the country's beaches, the opportunities for activities
like scuba-diving, the fact that English is widely-spoken, and its people's
well-deserved reputation for friendliness and conviviality. The primary aim,
he says, is to attract some the intra-Asia tourist trade - notably from
Taiwan and Japan - with European travellers potential extra. Already
visitors from East Asia (as opposed to the Asean countries) account for
about 40 per cent of total visitors.
There is some evidence that the commercial sector is heeding the message,
and putting its money behind the official policy. A number of big Asian
property group or conglomerates - including the Philippines' Ayala Land
Corporation and Malaysia's Kuok group - have either been developing resort
sites in the area or have plans to do so. The Manila Hotel, an impressive
complex overlooking the bay and used by General Eisenhower as his
headquarters during the war, may also go up for privatisation, and interest
is reported already to be pronounced.
But, despite all the fine words, the tourist authorities have a thin
promotional budget, and know they are competing against heavy-spending
neighbours. To date, the most visable product of their efforts has been the
hosting of the Miss Universe contest earlier this year. A promotional show
in Paris is promised for the autumn, to coincide with President Ramos' visit
to the French capital.

Need progress damage the environment?

The notices stencilled in green paint on the lamp-posts in one Manila suburb
could belong to any western city. 'Keep Greenhills clean and green,' they
read.
The difference is that the adjacent road consists of eight lanes of cars,
buses, jeepneys (elongated Jeeps converted into mini-buses) and juggernauts
 -all caught in total gridlock and belching exhaust fumes into the sultry
heat.
Such situations are as much the norm as the exception in Manila, where it
can take an hour to move between neighbouring suburbs. The sight of drivers
and pedestrians wearing nose-and-mouth masks, or simply wrapping their faces
with a scarf, is common.
Air pollution, and associated respiratory problems, are just one of the
country's intractable environmental problems. Like many developing
countries, the Philippines is torn between the desire to push ahead
industrial and commercial expansion, and the demands of its population for
the most basic of acceptable living conditions. In the Philippines' case,
these choices are made no easier by the history of public corruption; rapid
population growth, which gets no discouragement from the dominant Catholic
church; and past environmental neglect.
The fragility of the Philippines' core infrastructure adds a further twist.
Many Filipinos cheered when, on environmental and safety grounds, the
previous Corazon Aquino regime decided to mothball a nearly-completed
nuclear power station, built by Westinghouse Electric at a cost of over
Dollars 2bn on the Bataan penisula.
The decision, in 1986, was taken shortly after the Chernobyl nuclear
disaster, and partly justified in this context. 'What happened in the
Ukraine certainly did not help the cause of those who wanted to operate (the
plant). . . We want our own people to be spared this tragedy,' commented one
presidential aide.
Nevertheless, a few years later, this decision was being cited as one of the
key reasons for the power crisis which suffused the country. Today, debate
continues to rage over a number of proposed power-plant sites.
On the urban front, Manila has some of the worst slums in Asia; and one
environmental group has estimated that the sea-level in the city's bay area
has risen by about a metre over the past 40 years, due to the dumping of
garbage and the silting of the Pasig river.
But the needs are no less acute in rural areas, where the incomes of about
70 per cent of families falls below the (low) poverty line.
Much of the international spotlight has focused on mismanagement of the
Philippines' forestry resource. This is a complex tale of excessive logging
by both domestic and foreign interests, with efforts at curtailment
undermined by political corruption. The loggers' practices, in turn, have
led to river siltation and landslides, and thus compounded the impact of
natural disasters.
Indirectly, environmentalists claim, the mismanagement of the logging
industry has contributed to thousands of human deaths. One activist puts the
cost of siltation for over-logging at 4 per cent of gross domestic product,
over a 20-year period. Efforts at long-term remedial action have had patchy
results.
But even the logging problem cannot really be isolated. Population pressure
has been encouraging migration out of the lowlands and up the hills,
especially in Mindanao. However, many of these migrants tend to pursue
unsustainable cultivation techniques, with the result that their 'slash and
burn' approach compounds the loggers' earlier damage.
In this generally gloomy picture, there are some grounds for optimism. For a
start, the Philippines does have a fairly active environmental movement,
although many participants acknowledge that this is still splintered, and
that ideological differences between the various non-governmental
organisations (NGOs) tend to prevent cohesive action.
Nevertheless, its voice is heard, and there is some pressure on government
authorities to take note of its demands. The Philippines, for example, was a
signatory to the Rio Declaration, which came out of the Earth Summit in Rio
de Janeiro, promoting sustainable development. A Philippines Council for
Sustainable Development was set up, its members a mixture of government
agencies - including the Department of Environment and Natural Resoures -
and representatives of the principal NGOs operating in the environmental
field.
'The approach is not so confrontational now. . . It's better that we are
talking to them,' comments Rene Encarnacion, at the Haribon Foundation for
the conservation of natural resources.
But no one pretends that this is more than a start. 'Frankly, everyone looks
at the environment as an add-on job,' says Maxime Kalaw, president of the
Philippines Green Forum. 'It's a question of re-addressing the issues of
economic development - we need to look at a new economic order.'
In the meantime, as if internal problems were not enough, it is debatable
whether the west is helping. Greenpeace, the international environmental
organisation, made its first foray into Filipino environmental politics
earlier this year, when it alleged that hazardous waste was flowing from
industrialised countries into the Asian nation - despite a law which bans
waste imports. Computer waste from Australia and waste plastics, from the
likes of Germany and the US, were among the breaches, it said.
Another controversy has been triggered by the withdrawal of the US military
from Subic Naval Base. Local environmentalists argue that toxic and
hazardous waste was left behind, or inadequately stored. The US claims that
standards were enforced, and that it is co-operating fully in the provision
of information.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of The Philippines (10): Contractors to the rescue -
A model remedy for infrastructural ills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Huge resources will be needed to overcome the infrastructural inadequacies
that could threaten the Philippines' economic growth. The country has a poor
record in construction and maintenance, largely because insufficient money
was available following the economic slowdown in the 1980s.
Even foreign loans, made available from traditional official creditors,
could not be mobilised, for lack of counterpart local funds. Although there
have been some improvements recently, things are far from ideal.
The supply of electricity, after the frenetic activity to put up new
generating plants during the past two years, now slightly exceeds demand.
The new capacity, however, consists mainly of oil-fuelled power stations
that incur high costs. There is a strong need to build up new baseload
capacity to lower these costs and make the investment climate more
attractive.
Telecommunications, although improving fast, still need to be upgraded.
Telephone density in the country is still 1.4 units per 100 inhabitants,
among the lowest in the region.
Main roads in metropolitan Manila are often clogged, stretching travel times
for commuters and commercial deliveries. For example, the 15-kilometre drive
to Makati, the business and financial centre, from the outskirts of the
metropolis takes between 60 and 90 minutes.
These problems are beyond the financial capability, or even the competence,
of the government. However, the solution could come from a scheme,
introduced three years ago, that involved the participation of the private
sector in the construction of power plants.
During the frequent disruptions to the electricity supply in 1992-93 (when
working capacity could meet only up to 60 per cent of demand, so that
rationing was necessary), the government invited private-sector groups to
put up within short periods new power stations under build-operate-transfer
(BOT) arrangements.
Under this concept, private companies are contracted to construct the
facilities at their own expense; operate them after completion for an agreed
period, giving them an opportunity to recover their investment and also make
a profit; and then hand ownership over to the government at the end of the
period.
Through BOT, 14 fast-track power plants with a combined capacity of nearly
1,580 megawatts have so far been established - enough to cope with current
demand. Other projects under way, including base-load facilities, bring
total capacities contracted to private groups to some 6,000MW, involving
costs of at least Dollars 5bn.
The success of the programme has encouraged the government to widen its
approach. Under the Philippine Infrastructure Privatisation Programme
(Pipp), the BOT system now applies to other areas: highways, ports,
airports, canals, dams, water supply, irrigation, telecommunications,
transport, reclamation, industrial estates or townships, government
buildings, tourism, slaughterhouses, warehouses, waste management,
information technology networks and database infrastructure, education and
health facilities, sewerage, drainage and dredging.
The Pipp, believed to be the first programme of its kind in the world, has
made the Philippines a model for BOT undertakings in Asia. It now offers
various financial incentives for projects that entail costs of over 1bn
pesos (Dollars 38m), with reasonable rates of return on investments.
Among the biggest power projects is the 770MW Pagbilao plant, in Quezon
province, south-east of Manila. Hopewell Holdings, of Hong Kong, is
undertaking the project through a BOT arrangement with National Power
Corporation. It is likely to cost Dollars 973m, of which Dollars 235m will
come from equity contributions. Apart from Hopewell's equity of Dollars
205m, contributions were also made by the International Finance Corporation,
the investment arm of the World Bank; the Commonwealth Development
Corporation, the UK's overseas development finance institution; and Asian
Development Bank.
To tackle the telecommunications gap, meanwhile, the Philippine government
has introduced what it believes to be another world first. It divided the
country into 11 service areas, and assigned these to telecommunications
operators that were given specific performance targets. The programme aims
to increase the telephone density to about 6.7 units per 100 inhabitants by
the end of the decade.
Philippine Long Distance Telephone (PLDT) has been the dominant
telecommunications company in the country, accounting for 93 per cent of all
telephones. However, it also has a huge backlog of applications, and
receives many complaints of poor service and line breakdowns.
The opening up of the sector started with the government's grant last year
of licences for the operation of cellular mobile telephone systems, with
which PLDT was ordered to interconnect. It also introduced the service-areas
concept, to hasten the installation of new land lines.
To make the service areas attractive, each was allotted a potentially
profitable core in an urban centre - but also certain depressed areas,
untouched by economic progress because of poor communications. The programme
requires that 300,000 land lines be built in each area within the next five
years. The operators were given two years to demonstrate progress, or face
cancellation of their grants.
The huge costs of these projects have encouraged contractors to link up with
foreign companies, either as investors or suppliers of equipment.
Consequently most of the big names in world telecommunications are involved
in the Philippine programme.
Meanwhile, PLDT is trying to eliminate its backlog. By 1996, it aims to have
installed 1m new lines in its franchise areas.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of The Philippines (9): Manila Hotel awaits a partner
 -The privatisation programme is almost complete
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG

<TEXT>
The Philippine government will soon be winding down its privatisation
programme. Since its start in 1987, sales of 118.5bn pesos (Dollars 4.5bn),
have been generated, including nearly 35bn pesos from foreign investors.
The biggest of these was the recent sale of 60 per cent of Petron
Corporation, the nation's leading oil company. Saudi Arabian Oil Company
(Aramco) acquired 40 per cent for 14.7bn pesos in a public bidding, while 20
per cent raised 6.8bn pesos via a public offer of stocks.
Eighty-two other government corporations and 314 varying assets have been
disposed of, according to latest records. In 1986, the government slated for
privatisation 130 corporations, out of 301 in its roster, along with 419
assets (mostly 'non-performing') transferred by government financial
institutions - Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) and Philippine
National Bank (PNB) - to the national government.
According to current plans, sales of assets worth 78bn pesos over 1994-96
will complete the privatisation programme. Of this, 45bn pesos is targeted
to be earned this year, including the Petron sell-off.
Two other big items expected to go on the auction block this year are the
state's 51 per cent holdings in National Steel Corporation, at an asking
price of 7.5bn pesos, and a bloc of shares in Manila Electric Company
(Meralco), the power utility, estimated to be worth 14bn pesos.
The government is relying on proceeds from its privatisation programme to
help fill its fiscal gap, while new measures are being pursued 'to generate
more permanent sources of tax collections.' This year, implementation of the
law expanding the value-added tax system was delayed by a suit filed with
the Supreme Court by its opponents. Intended to raise additional collections
of 8bn pesos this year, the VAT law was originally scheduled to be
implemented on July 1. The Supreme Court issued a favourable ruling in late
August, which paved the way for its implementation by October 1.
For 1995, government sales of smaller holdings in PNB, Meralco and
Philippine Airlines (PAL) are targeted to yield 12bn pesos. PAL, the
flag-carrier, was offered in a bidding in January 1992 at which a local
consortium of major business groups won a 67 per cent interest for some
9.6bn pesos.
Another big-ticket item, National Power Corporation (Napocor), which
currently owns the bulk of electricity-generating capacity in the country,
is being planned also for privatisation, although various details still need
to be sorted out.
Principally, schemes are being studied to break up the giant corporation
into smaller units that will divide its generation and transmission
operations. The smaller units should also be within reach of the prospective
bidders.
Last year, Napocor reported total revenues of 41.79bn pesos, making it the
second-largest Philippine corporation in terms of sales, and total assets of
245bn pesos.
A jewel in the privatisation programme, the Manila Hotel, is also being
offered for sale by the state-employees pension fund which owns it, the
Government Service Insurance System (GSIS). A public bidding next month will
offer 20-30 per cent of the 510-room hotel for a minimum price of 280m
pesos. Thereafter, another 20 per cent will be offered to GSIS members and
hotel employees, and 5-15 per cent will be made available in a stock public
offering.
The winner in the bidding will become Manila Hotel's 'strategic partner',
and be expected to provide marketing and management expertise and financial
support for the institution, which has been experiencing declining revenues.
Company officials blamed this on the proliferation of new hotels in Manila,
and to its lack of a viable international marketing network.
This was the same strategy followed by Philippine National Oil Company, the
state energy group, when it launched the privatisation of Petron. After
getting a strategic partner through a public bidding, the company went on to
make a public offering of shares.
Petron's new partner, Saudi Aramco, has promised to assist in the oil
company's expansion plans, and to develop it as an exporter of refined
petroleum products in the region. Saudi Aramco is the world's largest
producer and exporter of crude oil.
Petron, as a government corporation, has often been slowed down by
cumbersome government procedures on purchases, hirings, and even the opening
of new retail outlets. As a majority private company, it may now be able to
pursue initiatives without having to go through public biddings or long
government audits.
However, Petron's privatisation is also in preparation for the eventual
deregulation of the local oil industry. Domestic prices of petroleum
products are still fixed by the government, although it has set up a fund on
which the oil companies may draw when prevailing price ceilings result in
losses for them.
The government has committed itself to the privatisation programme as part
of its key structural reforms. According to officials, the programme not
only results in additional revenues for the state, it also enhances the role
of the private sector as the engine of economic growth.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of The Philippines (8): Tested to the limit - The
stock exchange's latest challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Officials at the Philippine Stock Exchange did not try to conceal their
nervousness over the impending market debut of Petron, the country's largest
oil refining and marketing company.
The shares started trading last Wednesday. The 10bn pesos (USDollars 380m)
initial public offering, involving 20 per cent of the group's equity, had
prompted unprecedented demand from private investors, with a record number
of individuals getting share allotments.
Going into the Petron launch, Mr Eduardo de Los Angeles, president of the
PSE, warned that trading facilities would be tested to their limit. He was
correct; and heavy trading in the Petron stock drew attention away from
other blue-chips, leaving the market lower overall.
The price rose 136 per cent on the first day, above the offer price of 9
pesos, to 21.25; and continued up to 22 pesos on the second day of trading.
Up to that point, the PSE could handle around 20,000 trades a day. Mr de Los
Angeles reckoned that around 600,000 individuals would end up with
entitlements to Petron shares, and that perhaps 10 per cent would seek to
trade on, or shortly after the launch. The PSE was forced to upgrade systems
to handle the volume.
The Petron experience says much about the Philippines' stock market, which
promises much but only partially delivers. Yet the extent to which the share
market has already developed should not be underestimated. A few years ago,
trading was split between two exchanges - the old-established Manila stock
exchange, which began life in 1927, and the upstart Makati stock exchange,
based in Manila's main business district and formed in 1965. Rivalry between
the exchanges meant that turnover was low on both and, with different
trading floors, there was plenty of scope for rather dubious arbitrage
between the two markets.
This, coupled with the nation's political turmoil, was enough to deter
foreigners from using either. Much of the trading in larger Filipino stocks
 -like Philippine Long-Distance Telephone (PLDT) or San Miguel, the brewery
group - took place on overseas exchanges, such as New York's Nasdaq or the
American Stock Exchange.
It took a heavy political pressure to unify the two exchanges. But in 1992,
agreement on a single structure was reached, and in March 1994 the two
separate licences for the Manila and Makati Exchanges were withdrawn.
In part, the unification problem has been technical. The two exchanges had
installed different computer systems, and there was difficulty in
interfacing them, so that orders could be sent from one to another and a
common price for all stocks established.
Mr de Los Angeles admits that, even now, the communication links do
occasionally break down, with the result that different prices can still
emerge. However, he says that PLDT has promised to install a fibre-optical
cable, if possible before the end of the year, which should solve this
problem.
Even so, the stock market's infrastructure difficulties will not be at an
end. The clearing system, and brokers' back-office administration
facilities, are woefully inadequate. They were hard-pressed to cope with the
boom in business which occured in the last quarter of 1993, and events like
the Petron offering will renew the pressure. Plans to install a new,
computerised clearing system have already been laid, and grant funding is
due to come from the US Agency for International Development. The aim is to
have the new system up and running by mid-1995.
Regulation is another problem. The PSE plans to bolster its own surveillance
systems this autumn. Advice, it says, is coming from the New York Stock
Exchange. Already, in a market which tends to be driven by rumour, there are
regulations which allow the PSE to halt trading in any stock which rises by
more than 50 per cent in a day, or falls by 40 per cent in the same time
period - powers which it has been exercising recently, to the surprise of
some observers.
However, while supervision is the responsibility of the PSE, prosecution of
offenders falls to Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), and this remains
one the least respected of Filipino regulators.
These caveats notwithstanding, there are clear signs that the Philippine
stock market is growing up. Privatisations have widened the range of stocks
available. The sudden surge in share prices in late 1993, which caused the
Philippines to become the region's best-performing exchange last year, also
encouraged a number of local companies, often family-owned, to float in
pursuit of new capital.
Although the market's retreat earlier this year caused a few prospective
issuers to back off, few observers think this will be a permanent retreat.
'It's probably more of a postponment,' says Mr George Uy-Tioco, president of
Philippine Asia Equity Securities. 'Why sell at nine or 10 times earnings,
when you may get 15 times if you wait ?'
Indeed, the SEC calculates that the 13 initial public offerings which were
launched last year, raising 15.8bn pesos, were easily topped by the 17
issues which occured during the first six months of 1994. These, it says,
raised 19.1m pesos, or 120.9 per cent of last year's amount. That, moreover,
was before Petron.
Perhaps the biggest question-mark is whether international interest in
Filipino stocks will persist if political or electoral pressures mean that
Ramos regime is obliged to adopt a 'holding pattern' on the economic front,
and western countries pull out of recession, causing their own stock markets
to rise.
It has been calculated that around USDollars 2bn of international
fund-management money may have poured into the Philippines in past 18
months. But local brokers are aware that this could quickly be attracted by
higher or safer returns elsewhere.
One factor which may have some bearing on the strength of overseas interest
is the issue of 'A' and 'B' shares. In an effort to retain local control of
key assets, the Philippines constitution requires that at least 60 per cent
of certain companies, especially in the natural resources area, be held by
Filipinos. In the past, companies satisfied this restriction by dividing
their ordinary share capital into 'A' shares, to be held exclusively by
Filipinos, and 'B' shares, open to both Filipinos and foreigners.
The problem has been that 'B' shares have tended to see more demand,
relative to the tighter supply, and have traded at higher prices. Ms Rosario
Lopez, chairman of the SEC, is emphatic that her organisation would like to
see this distinction disappear. It is not approving any new issues which
incorporate this two-class share structure, she says.
According to Ms Lopez, companies can still meet their constitutional
obligations by monitoring their share registers, and barring foreign buying
when the 40 per cent level is about to be breached. However, Mr de Los
Angeles is not so confident. 'It's very difficult to monitor,' he warns,
'and only possible with the right equipment'.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of The Philippines (6): New rules bring benefits - A
more stable finance and banking sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Liberalisation of the Philippine financial sector - including the law
introduced in May 1994, allowing the entry of more foreign banks into the
country - has encouraged innovation and enhanced competitiveness of the
local banking system.
'The move is part of this overall drive towards globalisation, which our
local banks have consistently welcomed, because we have envisioned that the
Philippines' economic future depends on being part of the international
business community,' says Mr Rafael Buenaventura, president of the Bankers
Association of the Philippines (BAP), which groups the country's private
commercial banks.
However, local banks, during the discussions on the banking liberalisation
measure, have persistently called for a level playing-field, which includes
the application of uniform rules on capitalisation and performance standards
for both the existing banks and newcomers.
The local banks have also called for reciprocity in the grant of benefits to
the foreign banks. Pushed by Mr Buenaventura, the proposed reciprocity is
intended to provide a bargaining tool for the Philippine banking sector's
own efforts to penetrate foreign markets, particularly when the economy
shall have grown enough that local companies will start expanding overseas.
Not that the Philippine banks are uncompetitive. Since the first tentative
signals from government to liberalise the economy at the start of this
decade, they have been initiating their own moves to shape up. These have
resulted in more stable institutions, compared with those in the early 1980s
which easily wobbled when the economy ran into difficulty.
Proof of this, says Mr Gabriel Singson, governor of the Bangko Sentral ng
Pilipinas, the central monetary authority, is the banking system's ability
to withstand severe crises, such as the recent scam in the trade of
government securities in the secondary market that also involved a few
commercial banks. The central bank had to make emergency financial
assistance to these banks which were hit by runs on deposits.
The damage, it turned out, was limited to the few banks and investment
companies that got entangled in the scam. Owing to strict rules previously
instituted by the monetary authority for banks involved in such types of
transactions, the system emerged from that episode with only minor bruises.
Even the banks that required emergency loans have started repaying Bangko
Sentral.
The Philippine financial sector is actually composed of a grand total of
9,937 institutions, although commercial banks, numbering 33 with a
nationwide network of 2,580 branches, dominate.
The commercial banks, at the end of 1993, had total resources of 864bn pesos
(Dollars 38m), or 65 per cent of the total assets of the entire financial
system. The commercial banks also accounted for 87 per cent of total
deposits of 639bn pesos, which remain the largest sources of cash for the
banking sector.
There are four foreign banks operating full-service branches in the
Philippines. These are Bank of America, Citibank, Hongkong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation, and Standard Chartered Bank. They were already doing
business in the country when the General Banking Act, which closed the
industry to foreign groups, was adopted in 1948, and so were allowed to
remain.
Also operating in the Philippines are 17 offshore banking units (OBUs),
which in 1993 had total assets of Dollars 1.57bn, including lendings of
Dollars 568m. The OBUs' business volume has been declining over the past few
years.
Since the removal of all controls on foreign exchange current transactions
in 1992 and on the opening of new branches in 1993, the domestic commercial
banks have actively skewed their services and products to catch the expected
gains from the liberalised environment. Technology advancements also
heightened the competitive atmosphere.
These factors, according to Mr Buenaventura, 'have combined to generate a
marketing revolution that is pushing traditional banking into oblivion.
Competition - already very keen - continues to intensify.'
Current features of the local banking system which, according to Mr
Buenaventura, have 'fortified their armada of innovative products and
services', include:
The local banks operate a widely dispersed network of automated teller
machines (ATMs) that now totals 1,500 stations nationwide. Some of the ATM
cards are linked internationally, enabling the Philippine depositors to
access their peso and dollar accounts at home and abroad.
Banks have also developed new services to to catch some of the huge
remittances of Filipino overseas contract workers, which now amount to an
estimated 2.4bn pesos annually, compared with 600m pesos five years ago.
Philippine banks have either opened remittance centres abroad or established
links with correspondent banks.
In the battle for savings deposits, the banks have devised new accounts that
offer yields of up to 10 and 12.5 per cent on certain minimum amounts - way
above the 4-6 per cent interest rates on ordinary savings accounts.
At least 28 foreign banks have applied for the 10 slots allowed for wholly
foreign-owned operations under the banking liberalisation law. However,
those who fail to make the cut may still come in as co-owners, of up to 60
per cent, of existing domestic banks.
The implementing rules drafted by the Bangko Sentral for the banks' entry
were, by end-August, being scrutinised by Congress. The rules are expected
to be formalised and the foreign banks that will come in should be known
before the end of 1994.
A concern in the banking system is the high cost of intermediation. Owing to
high reserves requirements on bank deposits, a gross receipts tax on bank
lendings, and mandatory allocation of portions of their lendings for
agricultural and agrarian reform programmes of the government, the banks
find it necessary to pass on the added costs to their clients.
The high yields on treasury bills, as the government continues to tap the
local capital markets to finance its budget shortfalls, also push commercial
lending rates up.
Until August 15, when Bangko Sentral reduced the required reserves from 20
per cent to 17 per cent of deposit levels, domestic interest rates hovered
between 17 and 21 per cent. While these rates have attracted foreign
portfolio investments in sizeable amounts (which have propped up the peso),
they have also limited access by local users of capital.
The August 15 reduction in the reserves level has already pulled down
treasury bill rates. Leading commercial banks have also cut their prime
lending rates to around 13 per cent, from about 15 per cent previously. No
further substantial declines are expected, however, as monetary authorities
continue to be concerned about possible inflationary effects of such a move.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of The Philippines (7): Asian neighbours display
interest - The pace of trade and investment is increasing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even during the darkest days of the general slowdown in the Philippine
economy in the mid-1980s, visitors to the country could not help noticing
the brisk business at restaurants and shopping centres. Consumer spending
had remained buoyant, although the official gross national product was
contracting.
Economists attribute this to the extensive 'underground economy' that had
supported millions of Filipinos during times of adversity, and to the
ever-rising remittances from overseas workers who had sought jobs in North
America, the Middle East and other Asian countries for lack of opportunities
at home.
It has been these remittances that have consistently made up for the slow
domestic economy over the past few years. In 1993, for instance, while GDP
increased by only 1.7 per cent, a 27.5 per cent rise in the income from
abroad pushed up the overall GNP expansion to 2.3 per cent.
This was still evident from the economy's first-quarter record. While GDP
rose by 3.8 per cent, income from abroad expanded by 44.7 per cent, which
boosted the period's overall GNP growth to 4.8 per cent from the year
before.
The point of all this is that the Philippine economy can rely on an
underlying strength that could see it through difficult times. The improving
macroeconomic fundamentals, as such, can only mean that investors may expect
big gains as the economic growth gathers momentum.
With the 2.3 per cent GNP growth in 1993 came a 9.2 per cent increase in
revenues and 22 per cent leap in profits of the country's 5,000 largest
corporations. The declining trend in the overall cost of doing business
(slower inflation, lower interest rates and stable exchange rate),
therefore, should make the Philippines an attractive area for investment.
In the first half of 1994, the number of business plans registered for
incentives with the Board of Investments (BOI) reached 327 - an increase of
32 per cent over last year. These projects were estimated to require total
costs of 239.5bn pesos (Dollars 9bn), higher by 449 per cent than last year,
of which over 80.3bn pesos will be in the form of direct equity from the
investors.
In terms of actual foreign investments brought into the country, the Bangko
Sentral ng Pilipinas, the country's central monetary authority, registered a
total of Dollars 556mm in the first three months of 1994 - a giant leap over
the Dollars 188m in the same period last year, mainly due to a Dollars 502m
remittance made by the Saudi Arabian Oil Co for its newly acquired 40 per
cent holdings in Petron, the country's leading oil company.
This, along with the steady stream of foreign investment missions visiting
the country, has led Mr Rizalino Navarro, the trade and industry secretary,
to believe that the Philippines has now been 'promoted to the short-list of
attractive investment sites' in Asia.
More significant, according to Mr Herman Montenegro, president of the
Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry, has been the big increase in
the amounts reinvested by foreign companies already operating in the
country. Behind this trend are government efforts towards the liberalisation
and globalisation of the economy, he said. Implementation of the Foreign
Investments Act (FIA) of 1991 allowed up to 100 per cent foreign ownership
in any export enterprise and in a range of activities for the domestic
market.
A provision in the FIA, which limits foreign ownership in certain
industries, is due to expire in October, which will further open up the
economy to foreign capital. Among these areas are: life and non-life
insurance, travel agencies, tourist lodging houses, and convention and
conference organising.
The only areas that will remain closed are those listed in the constitution
and in specific laws. They include the media, services involving licensed
professionals, small-scale mining, marine-resources utilisation (except in
deep-sea fishing), retail trade, rice and corn production and trade,
co-operatives, and private security agencies.
While the increase in the amounts coming from Asian countries has set the
pace for overall growth in foreign investments in recent years, the US and
Japan remain the largest foreign investor groups in the Philippines.
Investments from Japan are expected to grow significantly, given that it
remains the Philippines' largest source of official development assistance.
For this year, for instance, of the Dollars 2.8bn pledged by the country's
traditional aid donors, Japan accounted for Dollars 1.5bn.
The department of trade and industry has noted the change in Japanese
investors' perceptions of the Philippine investment climate. During the
Japanese investment flows into Asia in the 1980s, the Philippines was at the
bottom of the list, owing to political uncertainties in the country at the
time.
In recent months, big Japanese groups have signified their intention to move
into the Philippines. Among the companies that have proposed major
investments are Hitachi, which is planning to put up a Dollars 300m
disk-drive plant, and Matsushita, which is putting in an additional 550m
pesos into its appliance manufacturing operation in the Philippines.
Investors from the US have also started to change their view of the
Philippines since the cooling of relations following the 1992 departure of
American military forces. In the first six months of this year, US
investments registered with the BOI amounted to 2.77bn pesos, the
second-largest after 7.58bn pesos by Hong Kong investors, and a sharp
increase from 463m pesos in the same period last year.
Mr John Negroponte, US ambassador to Manila, has noted that US companies
have been staying away from the Philippines owing to 'outdated perceptions'
about the political and economic climate in the country.
'There have been a lot of opportunities developed (in the Philippines) for
American businesses in recent years,' Mr Negroponte said. Foremost among
these opportunities, he added, were in infrastructure, including energy,
telecommunications, roads, ports and airports.
One US company that had recently chosen the Philippines as the site for new
investment is Quaker Oats, with a 150m pesos manufacturing project. The
decision to locate in the Philippines was reached after a survey of
available facilities and incentives in the region.
Mr Phil Marineau, Quaker Oats president, said during a visit in July that
the Philippines had been considered as 'one of (the company's) lead
investment areas in Asia' and that 'further investments in the Philippines
can be expected in the near future.'
If the country continues to gain the confidence of investors in this manner,
it may catch up with the rapid-growth economies of Asia sooner than
expected.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of Dutch Banking and Finance (7): Investor net
spreads to China - Profile of Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The agency charged with the job of attracting foreign investors to the
Netherlands may soon be setting its sights on Hong Kong and China.
As part of the continual fine-tuning of its international geographical
presence, the Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency (NFIA) is considering
hiring a local adviser in Hong Kong to start scouting out potential
investors in the region.
The Hong Kong project, if launched, would be undertaken in conjunction with
the Netherlands's two 'mainports', the port of Rotterdam and Schiphol
Airport.
Jochem Hanse, the NFIA's new director, said in an interview that the Hong
Kong move would be undertaken cautiously as a long-term attempt to persuade
local companies to use the Netherlands as a gateway into Europe.
'In the first instance, we're thinking of distribution facilities, because
there's no chance at all for the moment that production facilities from,
say, mainland China would be transferred to the Netherlands,' he said.
Chinese entrepreneurs 'will need distribution offices, sites and centres in
Europe in the coming years, and this is a role that could be filled by
Rotterdam, Schiphol and their hinterlands,' he said.
The Netherlands, with its pivotal role in European transport and
distribution, relies heavily on its geographical location and its
sophisticated transport infrastructure to attract foreign companies.
Other key selling points for foreign investors are the education levels and
foreign-language proficiency of the country's workforce and its proximity to
important clients and suppliers.
Some 80 per cent of foreign companies in the Netherlands are located in the
corridor that connects Schiphol and Rotterdam, the world's largest port, to
principal European markets such as Germany's Ruhr industrial area.
Unlike some countries, particularly in southern Europe, the Netherlands does
not make aggressive use of incentives, tax breaks and subsidies in the
battle to win over investors. Government grants are limited to the north and
south of the country and to an eastern district where the decline of the
textile industry has caused high unemployment.
'The subsidy battle in Europe can be fierce,' Mr Hanse said. 'We try to sell
our country on the basis of its assets."
The NFIA's traditional focus on three 'sales' elements - infrastructure,
workforce and proximity to market - will be preserved by Mr Hanse, formerly
the NFIA's deputy director, who was promoted to the agency's top job in
July.
Equally, Mr Hanse emphasises that the potential move into Hong Kong does not
herald any weakening of NFIA's promotional campaigns in its traditional
markets for inward foreign investment. Apart from some annual fluctuations,
the US generally accounts for half of all investment in 'greenfield' sites,
Japan for about one quarter, and Europe for the rest. The UK tends to
account for half of European inward investment into the Netherlands.
In terms of US and Japanese investment in particular, the Netherlands has
scored well in recent years. The country, which accounts for just 7 per cent
of Europe's combined gross domestic product, is estimated to have captured
about 20 per cent of all US and Japanese inward investment.
NFIA, with a budget of Fl 20m and a worldwide staff of 70, has four offices
in North America, an office in London, and an office each in Japan, Korea
and Taiwan. It also has a network of local advisers in countries such as
Switzerland, Sweden and Italy.
The agency, which is part of the ministry of economic affairs, manages to
attract a number of new investors every year who, on average, expect to pump
a combined Fl 2bn (Dollars 1.2bn) of investment into the country and to
create some 2,500 jobs. There are more than 5,000 subsidiaries of foreign
companies in the Netherlands, accounting for about one tenth of the
country's annual investment in fixed assets. Recent successes by the NFIA
include the decision by Eastman Chemical Co of the US to base its European
headquarters in The Hague and to make Rotterdam the site of its future
European production facility.
The Netherlands has also managed to win over a number of foreign automotive
suppliers, including the US brake-system manufacturer Kelsey-Hayes which
announced last year that it would build a factory in the southern Dutch town
of Heerlen, near the Belgian and German borders.
The biggest coup of all was achieved in the early 1980s, when Fuji Photo
Film started up its rolling investments in what ultimately proved to be
three new factories in Tilburg. The Tilburg site is thought to be the
largest foreign investment by a Japanese company outside the automotive
industry.
These successes do not mean NFIA's job is always an easy one. Competition
between European countries is stiff, and it shows no sign of abating.
Mr Hanse says NFIA's aim is not to give candidate investors 'the usual
blah-blah routine' but to help them in their decision-making process.
'An American or Japanese investor will come to this country with all sorts
of questions like does he need a work permit, where are the industrial sites
and what kind of tax deal can he put together. And he won't just be looking
here, he'll also be visiting Britain, Belgium and Germany, among other
places.'
The Netherlands can offer high labour productivity, but wages are not as low
as in Ireland and Britain, though they are roughly on a par with Belgium and
lower than those in Germany, Mr Hanse says. This tends to mean that
labour-intensive projects with a low-level of initial investment will tend
to look elsewhere. But the Netherlands does do well in heavier investment,
higher-skilled areas like chemicals and bio-technology.
More recently, it has attracted a number of US and other computer companies
that use the Netherlands as a distribution, light-assembly and quick-repair
base.
The sophisticated distribution centres make it possible for companies to
offer one-day computer repair in large parts of Europe. They also underline
why the Netherlands is emphasising 'value-added logistics' in the
Europe-wide competition for outside investors.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of The Philippines (4): Democracy heals divisions -
Politics: Mr Ramos is gaining confidence in his use of power,
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amid bickering between diverse political groups, Mr Fidel Ramos, who won the
presidential election in May 1992 in a field of seven candidates, has
mustered broad support for a reform-oriented economic programme.
He has pursued a reformist agenda under a democracy - an exception among the
east Asian 'economic tigers' bred under authoritarian forms of government.
Mr Ramos declared soon after taking office that, after the country's
traumatic experience with authoritarian rule (under former president
Ferdinand Marcos), his administration would try to duplicate the
neighbouring countries' success stories, but with a democratic government
that would attempt to reconcile the often unwieldy political culture with an
oligarchical economy.
That the economy has grown substantially since he took over indicates that
his strategy is on course. However, the wide gap between rich and poor, a
raucous compilation of politicians often guided by material rather than
ideological aims, and widespread corruption in the bureaucracy remain
formidable obstacles to the Ramos government's programme.
These problems have been fodder for the local communist insurgency and its
right-wing counterpart; though, with a programme that appears to have
succeeded in dividing radicals and moderates within the rebel movements, the
government has been able to slow their momentum.
Since the passage of a law early in the Ramos term, which legalised the
Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), its size has dwindled owing to
attrition and the reduced attraction of joining the movement. From more than
25,000 armed regulars in 1986, the communist ranks had shrunk to some
7,500-8,000 by 1993. The number of violent incidents involving the CPP's
armed unit, the New People's Army, had also slumped from about 3,600 in 1989
to about 1,500 in 1993. With the exception of one area in northern Mindanao,
all regions in the country registered sharply lower insurgent activity in
1993.
As the strength of the communists declines, due partly to the improving
economic conditions at home and the growing irrevelance of communism abroad,
conflicts rack the decimated forces of the Philippine rebels. In this
situation, the government has been able to drive top communist leaders,
living in exile in the Netherlands, to the negotiating table.
This division has translated to weaker communist fronts in the labour
sector. Left-wing militants were able to instigate strikes with impunity
nearly a decade ago, but their appeal has largely worn off. Last year, the
number of strikes was down to 121 from 182 in 1991, with the number of
workers involved down by by 20,000 to 35,000.
The peace negotiations are expected to continue the decline in the communist
ranks. Military officers believe that the emaciated movement can only be
capable now of limited terrorist actions in urban centres, though these can
have jarring effects on the business sector.
Moslem secessionist groups in the southern island of Mindanao have also been
participating in peace dialogues with the government. A ceasefire expected
soon, to be supervised by the Organisation of Islamic Conference through
Indonesia, could set the scene for a government initiative to end the
20-year conflict.
The two main Moslem groups, the Moro National Liberation Front and the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front, are said to have a combined armed following of
over 18,300. A third group, the extremist Abu Sayyaf, has become more
identified with kidnap and extortion activities, however, and a government
offensive on its main camp in July was believed to have severely crippled
its strength.
Talks between the government and the Moslem groups, late last year in
Jakarta, have led to an agreement to continue the dialogue, even though
violations of the truce have occurred occasionally in recent months.
Meanwhile, the ultra-right rebels, after the attempted coup d'etat in late
1989, have broken up, reportedly into at least four groups. Some of the
leaders have been recruited to the political parties, with a few even
fielded as candidates in the 1992 elections for Congress seats. None won any
of the national positions, but a few were elected at local-government level.
More of the former military rebels are being groomed for the 1995 elections.
As these favourable developments ease the demands on the military, the armed
forces have begun to take on such esoteric assignments as 'community
development' and 'environment protection.' These, acording to Mr Ramos,
'possess the attributes most conducive to economic development and nation
building.'
The task of maintaining internal security, including the fight against
insurgency, is to be turned over to the Philippine National Police (PNP),
though this move is being delayed by debates at various levels, indicating
its political sensitivity.
The recent alliance forged by Mr Ramos's ruling coalition, the
Lakas-National Union of Christian Democrats (Lakas-NUCD), with the largest
opposition party, Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (Struggle of the
Democratic Filipino), is intended mainly to bolster each group's bid for the
1995 elections for Congress seats; though it could also be exploited by the
Ramos administration to secure speedy approval for priority bills under its
reform agenda, before the election campaign starts in earnest early next
year.
In the Senate, many of the government's legislative initiatives have had a
rough time. The national budget has in recent years been put through the
wringer, after speedy passage through the House of Representatives.
In December, when Mr Ramos learned about drastic reorientation of certain
financing programmes, he initiatted discussions on a shift in the present
presidential system of government, with a bicameral legislature, into a
unicameral body. The initiative died after wide public disapproval of the
plan, which was seen as a ploy to return to authoritarian rule.
Since then, he has resorted to frequent direct dialogues with members of the
two chambers to get his priority bills moving. The excruciatingly long
process on the Expanded Value-added Tax proposal is an example of how that
type of partnership could be made to work.
Sceptics fear that the Laban-Lakas alliance could deepen the wedge already
separating various contending factions in many parts of the country. And
with local elections tending to be more emotional, some analysts are worried
that the 1995 elections could be accompanied by violence.
Nevertheless, Mr Ramos appears to have gained more confidence in his use of
political power, unlike his predecessor's awkward hold on the reins. He has
been able to prove that democracy can actually avoid constitutional gridlock
and pursue reforms, some of which require politically unpleasant policies.
His primary concern now is to craft 'a level of political will and national
capacity' to spur his nation towards sustained economic growth.
"Our democracy is far from perfect,' Mr Ramos has acknowledged, 'but it
works well enough for us to be able to move it away from the politics of
patronage, guns, goons and gold.'
If he can achieve that, the Philippines could become a new model for
modernisation in a region of strongmen and garrison states.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of The Philippines (5): Compromising for Cairo -
Population growth has divided government and church
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This summer's flare-up in relations between the government and the
Philippine Roman Catholic church was bound to happen eventually.
In a desire to show that overall economic growth is actually touching the
lives of its 66.5m people, the government has sought to slow the population
growth rate.
At the rate of expansion that was running at 2.3-2.4 per cent when the Ramos
administration took over, population growth was an obvious priority. It set
out to reduce the figure to less than 2 per cent by the end its six-year
term.
High population growth has been identified as one reason why the Philippines
has remained a laggard in a region of rapid economic region. Since 1980, for
instance, the economy has recorded a net growth of only about 1.5 per cent,
while the rest of its neighbours live in prosperity. About half of the
Philippine population is estimated to live in poverty. The government hopes
to cut that to 30 per cent by 1998.
In its medium-term plan, it has declared a family-planning programme as a
key component of its 'health, nutrition, and family planning services'.
Herein lies the heart of the conflict.
In contrast to the laid-back response of his predecessor, Mr Fidel Ramos has
pursued an aggressive population programme that promotes the use of
contraceptives. This has escalated over the last few months, with government
commercials on radio and television advocating the use of condoms, pills and
other contraceptive devices. The campaign was recently widened to include
sex education among schoolchildren.
Mr Ramos, the Philippines' first Protestant president in a predominantly (85
per cent) Catholic country, was apparently gaining some headway, since
latest official estimates showed that population growth in the first half of
1994 was about 2.1 per cent. This, government estimates show, has led to an
increase in per-capita output in the first half, for the first time since
1990.
In late July, Cardinal Jaime Sin, Archbishop of Manila, issued a 'letter to
parents', in which he accused the government of a 'destructive' policy on
population, including the promotion of abortion and the use of pornographic
materials for sex education among children.
The outburst was triggered by the government's apparent support, church
leaders said, for a document presented at this month's United Nations
conference on population and development, in Cairo.
However, the government expressed surprise. Health officials said it had not
been promoting abortion or 'sexual propaganda', but had been 'providing
natural and artificial methods, but we rest the decision on the woman, her
reproductive rights and her choices.'
Cardinal Sin asked the government to send to the Cairo conference delegates
'with sane minds', and to oppose moves to introduce abortion. While other
church leaders have singled out the US as being behind moves to push
abortion at the conference, the cardinal said: 'Global forces . . . are
poised to bombard our children . . . with reading materials and films
containing all sorts of pornographic, perverse and poisonous sexual
propaganda as part of their 'education'.'
The church followed up its harangue with a protest rally that drew hundreds
of thousands (local press estimates put the size of the crowd at 1 million)
to lambast the population programme and the government's stand over the
Cairo conference.
Mr Juan Flavier, health secretary, has remained calm during the raging
debate. He has also dropped the 'pro-choice' slogan in promoting the various
methods of family planning. He said he agreed with church leaders that 'it
was not the proper phrase to use on such as sensitive issue'.
The debate has recently been joined by the Protestant United Church of
Christ of the Philippines, where Mr Ramos attends Sunday services. It said
that 'women should have the power of choice' in such cases as rape or
possible complicated deliveries.
Another local denomination, the Iglesia Filipina Independiente (Philippine
Independent Church), has accused the Catholic leaders of 'dictatorial'
methods in promoting their objections to artificial family planning.
'Supposed to be a defender of freedom, the church does not allow its members
to practise freedom,' complained Bishop Javier Gil Montemayor, a former
Catholic, who heads the independent church.
Where the conflict will end remains unclear. But the Malthusians in the
Ramos government face their greatest challenge yet. The Catholic leaders and
the government subsequently had two meetings, which reached agreement on a
common stand against abortion at the Cairo conference. They also agreed to
tackle the Philippine population issue itself after the UN gathering.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of Dutch Banking and Finance (6): Powerful trio
dominate banking - 'Bancassurance' has intensified competition between
financial institutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite the continuing influx of foreign banks into the Netherlands, the
country's financial system is still dominated by a powerful trio of domestic
institutions.
The three big banking institutions - ABN Amro, ING Bank and Rabobank -
control a combined 80 to 90 per cent of crucial market segments, such as
mortgages and savings accounts. This makes it difficult for foreign banks to
achieve anything other than niche banking status in retail banking, in spite
of the Netherlands's reputation as one of the most open banking markets in
Europe.
The concentration of banking power has been strengthened by the spate of
mergers since 1989 that has whittled down the number of important domestic
participants from five to three.
But the oligopolistic nature of banking in the Netherlands does not mean
that Dutch banks have been freed from worrying about encroachments on their
territory. On the contrary the three are increasingly treading on each
other's turf. This, plus the advent of 'bancassurance' - the blurring of
strict divisions between banking and insurance - means that competition
between the three remains spirited.
In the fight to win over customers to pension plans and other types of
insurance products, the banks face competition from Dutch insurers such as
Aegon and also from Fortis, the Dutch-Belgian financial group, which like
ING and Rabobank, has consciously set out to cross-sell products through its
insurance and banking distribution channels. All in all, the battle lines
have changed dramatically since the 1970s and 1980s when the banks each had
a preserve of their own. Rabobank, a co-operative, was the farmers' bank;
the forerunners of ABN Amro were seen as catering to big companies; and
ING's predecessor NMB Bank, was associated with the medium-sized business
community.
To an extent the three big banks do retain specialities in the domestic
market. Rabobank is the leader in home mortgages, ING (through its Postbank
subsidiary) is a leader in money transfers, and ABN Amro is dominant in
equity trading and corporate lending.
Nevertheless the old days of seemingly exclusive preserves are gone,
creating heightened competition at home but also partly abroad.
Until the mid to late 1970s, the only bank with a large international
presence was ABN Bank, which later merged with Amro to create ABN Amro.
Since then, however, Rabobank and ING Bank have pursued international
expansion, with ING in particular establishing a reputation in emerging
markets banking, starting with its pioneering role in the trading of less
developed country (LDC) debt in Latin America after the international debt
crisis.
All three are now expanding overseas, with ABN Amro and ING targeting many
of the same emerging markets in eastern Europe and south-east Asia. In the
summer, for example, both applied to open offices in Mexico to take
advantage of new business opportunities expected to be opened up by the
North American Free Trade Agreement.
Rabobank, traditionally the bank that caters to the Netherlands's extensive
and rich agricultural sector, is increasingly focusing its international
aspirations on the area of trade and commodity finance, a field which ING
Bank selected long ago as one of the five components of its international
expansion.
At home, Rabobank's dominance of the agricultural and horticultural market
is being challenged by ABN Amro, which recognises the export-driven
potential of the country's farmers and greenhouse owners.
Competition is rife not only in traditional lending activities but also in
areas such as capital markets, where all three are trying to find new
sources of commission income.
Half-year results published by the three banks at the end of August show the
importance they attach to this growing pool of income. In each case, growth
of commission income outstrips interest income, due in part to the fact that
ABN Amro, ING and Rabobank were all involved in the underwriting syndicate
for the flotation of KPN, the Dutch telecommunications and postal group, in
June.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of Dutch Banking and Finance (5): Man in the street
is a reluctant shareholder - Sell-off fails to excite public
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The small Dutch shareholder - the proverbial 'man in the street' - was
consciously targeted in June when the government sold off its first tranche
of shares in Koninklijke PTT Nederland (KPN), the country's
telecommunications and postal company.
For the first time in a Dutch flotation, private investors were offered a
discount to the price paid by institutional investors. The inducement was
considered essential because Dutch households, unlike their counterparts in
the UK or even France, have never mustered much enthusiasm for buying
shares.
The 5 per cent discount, limited to the first 75 shares, attracted
considerable attention but did not, in the end, result in the participation
of up to 500,000 small investors, as forecast at one point by the Dutch
government.
Instead, some 188,500 private investors took part, of whom 31,000 were KPN
employees.
Wim Dik, KPN's chairman, said recently, 'Of course, the issue was three
times oversubscribed, but expectations that the KPN share would immediately
become a 'people's share' were not realised.'
The chairman of the stock exchange, Baron Boudewijn van Ittersum, also
acknowledged that the number of new investors was relatively low, but added
that the publicity may have the long-term effect of persuading people to
consider share purchases another time. 'Until recently, share ownership was
seen as something for the 'happy few'. After the KPN issue, it can be seen
as an activity for the entire population,' he said.
Explanations for the lower-than-expected level of enthusiasm abound. They
range from the mundane - the public's irritation with saturation advertising
for the shares - to the essential conservatism of the Dutch, their
preference for collective savings through pension schemes and impediments
created by the country's tax structure.
The answer may be more simple. Wilco Jiskoot, senior executive
vice-president at ABN Amro, the Dutch bank which lead-managed the global
share offering, said: 'The foremost factor was the general climate on the
bourse itself.' In the weeks leading up to the issue, the Amsterdam Stock
Exchange had softened and was well down on the peaks it had reached earlier
in the year.
Mr Jiskoot also noted that, in contrast to some other European
privatisations which have been done at almost 'give-away' prices, the KPN
issue was fairly priced, reflecting the government's goal of getting optimum
value for its shares.
In contrast to disappointment about private shareholder participation
expressed by the government and KPN, ABN Amro said the final result was
roughly in line with its own expectations and its internal analysis of the
Netherlands's pool of private shareholders.
Mr Jiskoot said a distinction must be drawn between real newcomers to the
business of investing in shares and the roughly 200,000 Dutch private
investors who have regular experience of actively selling and buying shares.
Although definitive, combined figures are not available from the various
Dutch banks that belonged to the flotation syndicate, ABN Amro estimates
that 20,000 to 30,000 new share investors were attracted to the KPN issue.
Mr Jiskoot agrees individual Dutch households are still less likely to buy
shares than in some other countries but, on balance, private share ownership
is nevertheless considerable in the Netherlands. 'The overall situation is
not all that different from other countries,' he said. 'The number of active
investors is smaller, but their combined holdings in shares are not at all
that small.'
There are signs of greater public interest in share investments. Since 1990,
investment funds, or mutual funds, have become a popular investment vehicle
for Dutch households, and most of the leading Dutch banks now offer such
funds, as do such traditional participants as the Rotterdam-based Robeco
investment group.
Nevertheless, the relative reticence of small Dutch investors to buy shares
is mirrored by the relatively limited ownership of shares among the
Netherlands's big and powerful pension funds. Although the country's pension
funds are gradually stepping up their equity purchases, shares account for
less than 30 per cent of the average fund's invested assets, which tend to
be heavily weighted towards bonds, particularly Dutch government bonds and,
to a lesser extent, real estate. In other countries, particularly in the US
or the UK, it is not uncommon for shares to make up half of total assets.
Again, part of the explanation lies in innate Dutch caution and
conservatism. Another factor is that, unlike US or UK fund managers, Dutch
pension funds are not normally confronted with quarterly measurements of
their investment performances. This may avoid the tendency towards
'short-termism' that is sometimes attributed to foreign institutional
investors, but it may also mean that Dutch funds are less motivated to boost
their results by investing more heavily in shares.
A frequently-cited explanation for Dutch attitudes to investing in shares is
the country's tax system.
Han Kleiterp, the former chairman of merchant bank MeesPierson, the big
civil servant pension fund, has emerged as a determined critic of the
double-taxation of distributed profits in the Netherlands through, first,
corporate tax and then tax on dividends.
Mr Kleiterp, who in May became chairman of Algemeen Burgelijk Pensioenfonds
(ABP), the Dutch civil servants' pension fund which ranks as one of the
world's largest, argues that the low level of distributed profits acts as a
disincentive for private investors to hold shares.
In an analysis released earlier this year, he showed that the top 29 listed
companies, excluding Royal Dutch/Shell, paid out only 29 per cent of net
profits in cash dividends in 1990-92. This compares with more than 60 per
cent in the US, more than 50 per cent in the UK and around 40 per cent in
Germany.
The tax system makes it attractive for Dutch companies to offer shareholders
an optional dividend in the form of new shares. But Mr Kleiterp noted that
this effectively allowed companies to do a public share offering without the
necessity of publishing a prospectus or undergoing the discipline of market
reaction to a share expansion.
Criticism of the tax system is shared by the University of Amsterdam's
Foundation for Economic Research, which in a series of reports has blamed
the fiscal treatment of distributed profits for the fact that the Amsterdam
bourse has traditionally faced lower price-earnings ratios than fellow
exchanges such as Frankfurt, Zurich, London and Paris.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of The Philippines (2): Property points the way - The
economy / The growing optimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The current scramble for a large property development project in the
Philippine capital indicates the level of confidence in the country's
economy.
Some of the leading local business groups have teamed up with foreign
companies to bolster their bids for the project, a 214-hectare parcel of
land in a military camp, Fort Bonifacio, which is being converted into a
commercial and trading centre for metropolitan Manila.
At a price which some describe as stiff, the winning group will need to put
up at least 11.8bn pesos for a 55 per cent share of the undertaking, in
partnership with the government. No fewer than 25 local firms and several
respected names in the real estate business in Hong Kong, Singapore,
Thailand and Japan have formed alliances to bid.
Over the past couple of years, investors have taken note of the economic
liberalisation initiatives being pursued by the Ramos government, which have
resulted in a more level playing field and competitive costs of doing
business.
'The country feels a surge towards (economic) recovery, fully supported by
such factors as low interest rates, single-digit inflation, a stable foreign
exchange rate, rising investments in housing and construction, rising
consumption, and the vigorous development of new growth centres outside the
capital region,' according to Mr Jaime Zobel de Ayala, chairman and
president of Ayala Corporation, whose property development arm is among
those bidding for the Fort Bonifacio project.
The significance of Mr Zobel de Ayala's comments lies in the fact that the
conglomerate that he heads has been around for 160 years - longer than any
other Philippine business enterprise. The Ayala group has seen it all -
wars, rebellions, prosperity in the 1950s, the rise and fall of a
dictatorship, the rebirth of democracy - and survived. That it continues to
seek avenues for expansion illustrates the prevalent sentiment in the local
business community.
Economic growth this year is targeted by the government at 4.5 per cent,
although the record in the first half indicates that this could be exceeded.
By the end of the current medium-term economic programme, which in June got
the backing of the IMF, the growth rate should be closer to those of the
high-growth economies in the region.
The recent end to the electricity shortage, which in 1992-93 impeded
economic recovery, should allow the industrial sector to become the engine
of growth. Agriculture, which employs 45 per cent of the labour force, is
also expected to recover from first-quarter stagnation caused by last year's
typhoon damage.
Official policies will continue to be biased towards deregulation and
liberalisation, according to Mr Roberto de Ocampo, the finance secretary.
The shift towards more outward-looking policies 'has put our economy on a
path towards rapid growth,' he said in a recent interview.
Mr de Ocampo acknowledged that this year's target rate remained modest
compared with those of other south-east Asian economies. However, Philippine
growth 'is in fact a little more dramatic', given that it comes from a lower
base. Philippine GNP increase in 1993 was 2.3 per cent, from a plateau in
1992 and 1991.
The finance secretary cited other factors that now make the Philippine
economy more attractive: the large pool of English-speaking, highly skilled
workers, and a culture that has a close affinity and familiarity with
western business practices; as well as the country's strategic location at
the gateway of the Asia-Pacific region.
In July, Mr de Ocampo led a Philippine team of economic managers to the
meetings with the Paris Club of official creditors and the consultative
group of donor nations and institutions, at which new economic concessions
were granted to the country. Participants in these meetings were largely
optimistic about Philippine prospects.
The Ramos government's reform initiatives started barely two months after it
had assumed office, by widening the relaxation of foreign exchange controls
on current transactions, started by the previous administration. In August
1992, the government allowed the free flow of foreign exchange and gold, and
removed the requirement for exporters to remit foreign exchange revenues to
be sold only to Manila banks.
These have since been relaxed further, by raising to Dollars 3m the maximum
amounts that Philippine residents may buy from local banks for investment
abroad. If secured from sources other than banks, a resident may take out
any amount of foreign exchange.
Also lifted were restrictions on the flow of funds into and out of the local
capital markets, which helped bolster the level of foreign participation in
the stock exchanges.
In July 1993, a new central monetary authority, the Bangko Sentral ng
Pilipinas (Central Bank of the Philippines) was established after the old
central bank had ceased to be effective in its tasks of stabilising
inflation and the exchange rate, owing to heavy losses incurred from
mismanagement during the Marcos administration.
Mr Gabriel Singson, the Bangko Sentral governor, listed the following as the
monetary agency's principal accomplishments in its first year:
Inflation has been reduced to 7.6 per cent in 1993 from 8.9 per cent in
1992. It rose above 10 per cent briefly in early 1994, but slowed to about
9.6 per cent by mid-year. It is targeted to fall further to 8.5 per cent by
end-1994.
The overall balance of payments has consistently reflected a surplus, which
at the end of the 1994 first quarter was Dollars 616m.
International reserves have risen steadily. At the end of July, they were
estimated at Dollars 7.74bn, equivalent to nearly four months' imports.
The exchange rate has been largely stable, with fluctuations noted during an
escalation in debates on whether the local currency should be devalued. By
July, the peso was actually 6 per cent higher against the US dollar.
Interest rates declined, with the closely watched 91-day Treasury bill rate
falling below 10 per cent in early August for the first time in many years.
A reduction in the reserves requirement on bank deposits, from 20 per cent
to 17 per cent on August 15, resulted in a drop in bank intermediation costs
that pulled down lending rates.
Above all, through a variety of debt-reduction measures pursued over the
past five years, the country's debt service burden had gone down to 19.5 per
cent of annual exports in 1993, compared with a crippling 90 per cent at the
height of the local foreign exchange crisis in 1983-85. Most of the
country's foreign exchange obligations are now to bilateral creditors (39.4
per cent) and multilateral sources (22.9 per cent), with only about 18.7 per
cent owed to commercial banks and other financial institutions.
The biggest obstacle to economic recovery, the chronic budget deficit, is
also being tackled more decisively, according to the fiscal managers. In the
first seven months of this year, the government recorded a surplus of 7.4bn
pesos; and it projects that this can be sustained until the year-end. If
that materialises, it will be the first budget surplus in over two decades.
It will also bolster the budget proposal for 1995, now being scrutinised in
Congress, which projects a surplus of 15.5bn pesos.
However, overall public sector spending, covering both the national
government and the state-owned corporations, is still expected to show a
deficit. In 1995, this is forecast to level off at 1 per cent of GNP, from
an estimated 2.2 per cent this year.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of Dutch Banking and Finance (3): The EOE will be
humming in 1996 - The European Options Exchange plans to introduce a unique
new trading method
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amsterdam's European Options Exchange (EOE) is planning to become the first
options exchange in the world to combine the traditional 'open outcry' of
human voices with the subdued hum of computer-screen trading.
The unique new trading, due to be launched in early to mid-1996, marks a new
phase in the EOE's 16-year -history.
When it was established in 1978 as the first options exchange outside the
US, the EOE adopted the open outcry system that prevailed on the Chicago
Board of Trade (CBOT) exchange in the US. The electronic exchanges of the
late 1980s had not yet been born, and the 'pit' seemed the logical place to
bring together supply and demand.
In keeping with the widespread use of electronic trading, the EOE wants to
move with the times yet also retain its trading floor.
'What we're effectively going to be doing is building an electronic exchange
alongside our existing exchange, and then coupling the two together,' Joost
Kuiper, the EOE's general director, said. 'It'll be an important event in
the existence of our exchange.
As the first options exchange in Europe - hence the ambitious name - the EOE
had originally hoped to become Europe's sole centre for the trading of
options. But other countries, from the UK to Germany and from France to
Switzerland, eventually built their own national exchanges.
Most of the recent newcomers have introduced fully electronic trading
systems, eschewing the trading floor.
However, EOE believes there is still room for open outcry in Amsterdam
because of the 'atypical' character of the exchange: the EOE is
overwhelmingly a retail exchange, with 70 per cent of turnover generated by
private investors rather than the institutional investor who sets the tone
on institutions such as Germany's Deutsche Terminborse (DTB) or the London
International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe).
'The market for the larger retail order is at heart a 'talk market',' Mr
Kuiper said.
The proposed new trading system, called Switch, will allow the EOE to use
open outcry in some areas and electronic trading in others.
Details are still being worked out, but small retail orders below some sort
of limit, such as 10 or 20 contracts, will be executed electronically
through automatic matching.
This is expected to be far more efficient and cost-effective than the
present system of writing order slips and matching supply and demand through
open outcry.
However, larger retail orders and smaller wholesale orders for institutional
investors will remain the preserve of the trading floor.
Big institutional orders - so far an underdeveloped market segment at the
EOE - will probably also be handled electronically.
This computer-based trading is probably best suited to handle the growing
trend to more tailor-made, less standardised contracts for bigger investors.
The Switch system will be flexible, enabling the EOE to determine for each
class of options contracts which system is more suitable - open outcry on
the floor or electronic trading by screen. For traders on the floor, the two
types of trading will be brought together by hand-held computer terminals.
Besides building its ambitious new trading system over the next two years,
the EOE will also be concentrating on attracting more insti-tutional
investors to the exchange.
Unlike the DTB, which was established with the full co-operation of the big
German banks, the EOE's birth in the late 1970s was not wholeheartedly
welcomed by the Dutch financial esta-blishment. The exchange was considered
too risky for the cautious Dutch, and an early demise was predicted.
The EOE's success in the face of widespread scepticism was due to the
efforts of many small brokers and traders and of the publicity campaign
waged by its first director, Tjerk Westerterp. His unusual step of
sponsoring a Dutch soccer team and linking the EOE's name to classical music
competitions brought a wealth of publicity and a crowd of retail investors
to the exchange.
This retail bias is reflected not only in the 70:30 ratio between retail and
insti-tutional turnover but also in the relatively low share of index
options in the EOE's total turnover.
'My targets are 50:50 for retail and institutional, and index options must
grow, too,' Mr Kuiper said.
Index options, typically a product for institutional investors, accounted
for roughly 25 per cent of contract turnover in 1993, against nearly 65 per
cent for stock options, a type of option that generally attracts private
investors.
By 1996, the EOE hopes to have raised index options to nearly 40 per cent of
the total.
One way the EOE has found to woo institutional investors is to offer them a
single account at the clearing level, regardless of the number of different
brokers used.
Another recent concession to bigger investors was a sharp cut in brokers'
exchange fees on the EOE's futures subsidiary, the Financiele Termijnmarkt
Amsterdam (FTA), on June 1. The cuts, designed to be passed on to investors,
are meant to boost liquidity and volume.
The EOE has also introduced 'flex options' on Dutch state bonds, allowing
the investor to tailor the expiry date and exercise price to his precise
requirements. 'Flex has been very important for us, and we'll certainly be
offering more flex options,' Mr Kuiper said.
And, finally, the EOE hopes to deepen the liquidity of its market by helping
to create better-capitalised market-makers able to handle the bigger deals
that institutional investors are expected to bring to the exchange.
To this end, Mr Kuiper is trying to put together a 'liquidity fund' through
which institutional funds can be injected into smaller, promising
market-makers. The total money involved will not be large, but the ultimate
effect can be important for the exchange.
'Investing Fl 1m in a smaller market-maker can really put the firm on the
road to bigger things,' he said.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of Dutch Banking and Finance (2): Priority is jobs,
jobs, jobs - Wim Kok has inherited an economy that seems poised for growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bill Clinton's celebrated reminder that 'It's the economy, stupid' has
little relevance to the Netherlands's new prime minister Wim Kok, who has
inherited an economy that seems poised for a return to healthy economic
growth. But if he had to choose a slogan to capture his priorities, Mr Kok
might well have selected 'It's jobs, jobs, jobs'.
The latest Dutch coalition government, inaugurated on August 29, has started
its four-year term with good prospects of economic buoyancy but also with
continuing signs that the country's long-standing unemployment problem is
not going to go away easily.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, in a report on
the Dutch economy in June, argued that the Netherlands's unemployment
problem is a structural one that cannot be overcome by economic growth
alone. Its recipe for success is reducing rigidities in the labour market,
decentralising wage-setting and, crucially, making the dole less attractive
by widening the present narrow gap between welfare benefits and low-level
wages.
'In a nutshell, the goal should be to reduce labour costs, redress the
incentive balance between working and not working, and improve labour force
skills and competencies, in all cases especially at the lower end of the
market,' it wrote.
Mr Kok's government has clearly targeted job creation as its main task, and
it is planning to pursue this goal through a mixture of fiscal measures and
specific programmes aimed at the long-term unemployed. It remains to be
seen, however, whether Mr Kok will really manage to address what the OECD
describes as the Achilles heel of the Dutch economy.
'The biggest worry confronting the Netherlands is the shortage of jobs,' Mr
Kok wrote in his government programme, which has received the backing of his
own Labour party, the right-wing Liberals and the left-of-centre D66 party.
'Too many people remain, counted or uncounted, in the waiting room of the
labour market; are unfit for work; or find themselves outside the labour
process in middle age.'
On its own, the quicker pace of economic growth is expected to help create
230,000 jobs during the cabinet's lifetime. But this will not be enough to
deal with the 300,000 people projected to enter the job market in this
period.
For this reason, the new three-party coalition government will be actively
pursuing programmes to stimulate jobs, particularly at the very lower end of
the labour market. This will be done, in part, by reducing taxes and social
premiums, thereby making employees less expensive for employers. 'Gross
labour costs must come down, especially for lower-paid labour,' Mr Kok said.
At the same time, some business sectors may be exempted from the minimum
wage laws to help generate more entry-level jobs for job seekers. In another
move, some 40,000 jobs for people on the dole will be created by the state
in public duties such as home-help for the elderly, child care, and public
safety and security.
What Mr Kok will emphatically not do is lower unemployment benefits to
encourage the unemployed to seek or accept work. This option - frequently
proposed by those like the OECD who argue that the country's generous
welfare provisions make it unattractive for dole recipients to take low-paid
jobs - would be unacceptable to the rank and file of the Labour party. It is
in this area of labour policy that the biggest doubts arise about the new
government's ability to stimulate people to forego the security of state
benefits and seek work.
According to the Netherlands's own narrow definition of unemployment, only
about 7 per cent of the potential labour force is out of work. But the
OECD's broader definition - which takes in all people of working age
receiving disability and other types of social security benefits, as well as
people enrolled in special job creation programmes - puts unemployment at
just above 25 per cent.
The unemployment problem notwithstanding, the Netherlands is estimated to be
on track for economic growth of 2.0 per cent to 2.25 per cent in 1995, up
from a projected 1.5 per cent this year and just 0.3 per cent in 1993.
The buoyant growth predicted for next year confirms that the Dutch economy
is out of danger of slipping into the same recession that plagued its big
European trading partners, especially Germany, in the early 1990s.
Thanks to the Dutch guilder's close links to the German mark, inflation is
expected to be relatively under control at 2.5 per cent this year, falling
to 2.25 per cent next year.
'The economic prospects facing the new cabinet are good,' MeesPierson, the
Dutch investment bank said in a report. 'The economy is just beginning to
revive, inflation is on the way down, and employers' organisations and the
trade unions have signed a national deal paving the way for wage restraint."
Though the economy may look rosy, the new government, and especially the new
finance minister, Gerrit Zalm, a member of the pro-market Liberals, face
serious difficulties in the area of public finances.
After several years of steady, albeit small, declines, in the financing
deficit, the shortfall in 1995 and 1996 is expected to be static at 3.3 per
cent of gross domestic product, before falling to 3.1 per cent in 1997 and
2.9 per cent in 1998.
At this 1998 level, the Dutch financing deficit will fall just within the 3
per cent norm established for European monetary union at the end of the
1990s. But the absolute level of public debt will remain high, causing
long-term worries for the government.
Given the still precarious nature of the national debt, the new government
will obviously be hoping that the predicted acceleration of economic growth
will not only materialise, but that it will be even higher than projected.
If so, tax revenues will also come in above budget, creating room for a
renewed assault on public debt.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of Dutch Banking and Finance (4): Poised for a
shake-up - Stock exchange reforms mark end of the 'hoekman'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Amsterdam Stock Exchange is poised to embark on the most radical
shake-up in its near 400-year history.
On September 30, the bourse will be split into retail and wholesale
segments. For the first time, screen trading will be introduced into the
professional sector of the market, in an attempt to compete with London's
screen-based SEAQ International, which has captured large swathes of trading
in Dutch equities
At a later stage, probably around January 1, foreign banks and stockbrokers
will be allowed to trade on the Amsterdam exchange from their bases
overseas. This, too, is a direct challenge to London's success in attracting
Dutch business across the English Channel.
The reforms, the culmination of years of piecemeal changes, will mean the
demise of the traditional 'hoekman', or stock jobber, who acts as an
intermediary in Dutch share trading.
The bourse's chairman, Baron Boudewijn van Ittersum, is in no doubt about
the far-reaching nature of the impending changes. 'There has never been as
big a change to our trading system as the ones we are about to make. Until
now, the principles of the 'hoekman' system have not, as far as I'm aware,
undergone any fundamental changes since the 17th century,' he said.
However, the writing has been on the wall for the hoekman since at least the
mid-1980s, when larger participants, Dutch banks and Dutch pension funds,
began to complain that the jobbers' small size and limited capitalisation
was impeding trading and reducing liquidity.
In 1986, a first step was taken to end the hoekman firms' monopoly by
allowing market players to do large group trades without the help of a
hoekman.
Starting later this month, the bourse's two dozen hoekman firms will be
whittled down to no more than five to 10 companies. In their new guise, they
will act as market specialists, roughly along the lines of their
counterparts in New York. The new-style hoekman will operate exclusively in
the retail market, but will also serve as a point of contact between the
retail and wholesale ends of the bourse.
Although Amsterdam is injecting screen trading into its overall trading
system, it has consciously stopped short of abolishing the trading floor
altogether, as London did in its Big Bang in the late 1980s. 'The decision
to retain the philosophy of the central market is a good one,' Mr van
Ittersum said, citing debate in London about the wisdom of the UK capital's
alternative - adhere to a quote-driven, market-making system. London is
starting to look at continental practice at a time when many continental
bourses are making some of the concessions to professional investors and
trades that lay at the heart of Big Bang.
But he stressed that Amsterdam's continued attachment to the floor will have
to be borne out by future events and by continued advantages in terms of
cost, of swift and transparent price formation, and of a 'feeling for the
market' fostered by direct, daily, physical contact. 'The floor itself is
not a dogma, it must be a question of efficiency,' he said.
Not surprisingly, some hoekman companies opposed the changes that heralded
their transformation into specialists, and they called for a longer
transition period. The reforms, first scheduled to take place in the 1994
first half, will now go ahead on September 30, Mr van Ittersum said.
Foreign-based traders will probably not be admitted until three months
later. This is partly because the Amsterdam bourse's members have not yet
decided whether foreigners will be required to take out ordinary membership
or a cheaper form of extraordinary membership.
'We also want to give our members three months of trading under the new
system before opening it up to foreigner traders,' Mr van Ittersum said.
A similar three-month gap was observed in the launch last year of the
Amsterdam Treasury Market (ATM), the Dutch capital's screen-based trading
system for Dutch government bonds which has attracted 15 foreign
participants, mostly based in London. 'I expect many of these 15 to be
interested in the new equity market, too,' Mr van Ittersum said. 'In the end
I think we'll have the 10 to 20 leading foreign houses as participants.'
One prospective foreign participant is CS First Boston, which recently
announced it was closing its trading and backroom operations in Amsterdam
and transferring staff to London. The stock exchange is hoping to keep CS
First Boston involved in Dutch bourse trading, despite its virtual departure
from Amsterdam.
Amsterdam believes that foreign involvement could take off quickly after
January. 'If the three biggest players in London say ''Yes, you're better
off in Amsterdam', then I think interest could develop very swiftly."
Mr van Ittersum said the best test of Amsterdam's success in competing with
London will be the spreads between bid and offer prices on the bourse's
Asset (Amsterdam Stock Exchange Trading System) screens. If these are as
narrow or narrower than those on SEAQ's screen, Amsterdam will have reached
its stated goal of being the international price leader for Dutch equities.
Another test, though perhaps more difficult to judge because of the lack of
transparency in international turnover figures, will be the amount of equity
turnover that flows back to Amsterdam from London.
At its lowest point in 1992, some 60 per cent of Dutch equity trading took
place in Amsterdam, according to a milestone report by McKinsey, the
consultants, which galvanised the Dutch financial community into action and
helped clear the way for October's reforms.
'McKinsey said that at this rate we might fall below 50 per cent in three
years' time. Your goal must be to serve as the price leader for your own
equities, and to be leader you must have at least a majority of the volume,'
he said.
'I want us to try to get back in any case to a ratio of 75:25, preferably
80:20. That is our goal.'

FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of The Philippines (1): Gaining on the neighbours -
The government has devised a programme which it hopes will produce economic
growth closer to that of other south-east Asia countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the 'sick man of Asia' for much of the past decade, the Philippines
missed the investment flows that helped to transform the region, where it
enjoys a strategic geographic position, into the world's economic growth
leader.
But the patient, having been wheeled out of intensive care, is now leaving
the recuperation ward, and is ready to join in the dynamic regional economic
development.
The Philippines is 'in the most advantageous position, for at least a
generation, to finally realise its true economic potential,' said Mr Howard
Handy, senior resident representative in Manila of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), in a recent talk with locally based businessmen.
He said the outlook for the country remained 'highly encouraging' following
the launch of 'a home-grown (economic) programme, well crafted by a
competent and committed administration.'
This programme aims to lift the Philippines' economic growth rate from 2.3
per cent in 1993 to about 6 per cent by 1997 - closer to the levels achieved
by its south-east Asian neighbours. It also seeks an inflation rate of 4 per
cent by 1997, to assist the country's competitiveness with a stable exchange
rate.
The economic programme was granted IMF support in June, with a three-year
credit worth Dollars 684m. This in turn triggered a rescheduling package
from the country's Paris Club official creditors, covering debts falling due
until the end of 1995; and new official development assistance commitments
worth Dollars 2.8bn each for 1994 and 1995 by the World Bank-led
consultative group of aid donors.
By the end of these assistance programmes, the Philippine economy should
already be taking off, officials led by Mr Roberto de Ocampo, the finance
secretary, forecast.
After struggling with power shortages in 1992 and 1993, investors are
becoming more aggressive, in an environment made more open and liberalised
by the government's reform initiatives. The labour sector, too, has
stabilised, with fewer strikes in the past couple of years.
The economy grew in the first quarter of this year by 4.8 per cent, the best
performance for a three-month period since 1990; and early estimates point
to second-quarter expansion of more 5 per cent over last year. This has led
to expectations that the 4.5 per cent target for the whole of 1994 will be
exceeded.
The government of Mr Fidel Ramos, the cigar-chomping former army general who
won the 1992 presidential elections with just 23 per cent of the vote,
continues to consolidate its hold on power by widening a 'rainbow coalition'
with members of Congress. In late August, Mr Ramos's ruling Lakas-National
Union of Christian Democrats (Lakas-NUCD) party forged an alliance with the
opposition Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (Struggle of the Democratic
Filipino).
While the alliance was ostensibly intended to achieve a common ticket for
the 1995 elections for congressional and local-government officials, it also
enhanced the administration's chances of getting legislative support for its
wide-ranging reform measures.
'Through coalition-building and consensus politics,' said Mr Jose de
Venecia, speaker of the House of Representatives and secretary-general of
Lakas-NUCD, 'the Philippines will be achieving its own economic miracle.'
The miracle, however, would be 'of a slightly slower pace (compared with
other Asian growth rates), since we are trying to achieve results without a
dictatorship and without recourse to arms.'
The Filipinos' sad experience with the strong-man rule of the late Ferdinand
Marcos, who was ousted in 1986 and died in exile in Hawaii three years
later, has been a significant factor behind the strong preference for
democracy.
Mr Ramos has achieved the political stability on which economic gains are
being erected. So far, his reform initiatives have largely withstood the
resistance from sectors most hurt by the changes. His tax reform programme
received encouragement in August, with a favourable Supreme Court ruling on
the new, expanded value-added tax law, paving the way for its much-delayed
implementation. The VAT law had been opposed by various sectors, which
feared that it would lead to increased inflation.
Another achievement of the Ramos government has been the restoration of a
normal electricity supply to the main island of Luzon, including
metropolitan Manila. During 1992 and 1993, industrial activity had been
handicapped by power-cuts that often lasted between 10 and 12 hours a day.
With the granting of emergency powers by Congress, in 1993, Mr Ramos
facilitated the entry of private groups into power projects that were
exempted from the usual cumbersome procedures for government undertakings.
In less than a year, the supply shortage was overcome - even if local power
rates are now the second-highest in Asia, because most of the available
capacity comes from oil-fuelled stations.
The president has also cemented relations with the country's neighbours in
Asia, by visiting all of them during his first year, along with a trip last
November to the US, the Philippines' old colonial master. On all of these
visits, Mr Ramos has encouraged investment in the Philippines.
This month, he takes his programme to Europe, with stops in Belgium, France,
Spain, Germany and Italy, where he will once again deliver the message: 'The
Philippines is back in business in the heart of the world's fastest-growing
region.'
Mr Ramos approaches the future with confidence. He recently launched a
programme of 'three modernisations'. In his state-of-the-nation address in
June, the president listed these as: increasing the economy's productivity
and competitiveness; making 'people empowerment' work, in place of political
patronage; and social reform, to modernise the Filipino family and the
national community.
He said there would be more attention to small and medium-sized industries
as the 'building blocks of economic democracy'. There would also be an
orientation towards exports, augmented by the country's accession to the
Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Further reforms in government would include a reorganisation and
streamlining of the bureaucracy. 'We are not getting the full worth of every
peso we spend on each government agency,' he said.
As part of its social-reform agenda, the government will channel more money
into basic education, health care and land reform. Its proposed budget for
1995 allocates 22.3 per cent of expenditure to social services - the
second-largest item after business-related and infrastructural spending,
which receives 43.9 per cent.
These policies have not failed to gain favourable reaction even from some of
the country's leading opposition politicians. Mr Juan Ponce Enrile, a former
member of the Marcos cabinet and currently a member of the House of
Representatives, said recently: 'I think one should not be blind to the fact
that the administration has got this country out of the doldrums, and we are
now stabilising and moving forward.'
Other observers familiar with the Philippines, however, say that after the
recent gains, the next question will be: 'how long before the next
self-inflicted setback?' Dramatic gains have also been recorded in past
attempts to put the government and the economy in order. In 1988, economic
growth was approaching double digits, but attempted coups d'etat towards the
end of 1989 scared investors away.
In the early months of the Ramos government, a series of kidnaps, mainly of
ethnic Chinese and foreign nationals, also deterred foreign investors. That
problem has been contained, particularly by Mr Ramos's placing Mr Joseph
Estrada, his vice-president, in charge of the presidential anti-crime
commission.
Some economists warn that the current deficits in the country's trade
account, if not reduced, could precipitate another crisis in its external
transactions, leading to another 'boom-and-bust' cycle like those that
defeated previous attempts at sustained economic growth.
So far, however, economic managers say that healthy capital flows have made
up for these trade gaps. The World Bank, in a report in June, noted that the
government's initiatives had created opportunities for foreign investors.
Other reforms in the legislative pipeline, it added, would 'further enhance
efficient private sector development'.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of Dutch Banking and Finance (1): Action plan lifts
Amsterdam's status - The centrepiece of the Dutch capital's programme of
financial reforms is an overhaul of the stock exchange's trading system this
month. Ronald van de Krol, author of this survey, discusses achievements
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Six years after the launch of a wide-ranging programme to boost Amsterdam's
status as a financial centre, the Dutch capital has decided to wind up its
campaign of reforms, initiatives and promotional activities.
The move, far from signifying defeat, is clear confirmation that Amsterdam
has achieved its aim of bolstering its standing in the face of concerted
competition from larger international financial centres, particularly
London.
The campaign, which began as a joint initiative of prominent bankers in
1988, was not intended that Amsterdam should rival the stature of first-tier
European centres such as London or Frankfurt. Instead, the goal was to
confirm Amsterdam's place in the second tier and to prevent its slide into
third-tier status.
The centrepiece of the campaign - a radical overhaul of the trading system
at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, with a separation of the wholesale and
retail segments of the market - is due to take place on September 30.
Earlier milestones in the campaign, which was formally ended in May,
included the abolition of exchange duty, reforms of the government bond
market, and the introduction of a fixed seven-day settlement system.
Another successful element in the promotion of Amsterdam was persuading
foreign banks, particularly in the Far East, to choose the Netherlands as a
base for expanding into the European market place.
There have also been disappointments along the way. Amsterdam's hopes of
attracting a prestigious multilateral financial institution, such as the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development or the nascent European
Central Bank, were both dashed.
Another of the campaign's original 23 aims - the development of Amsterdam as
a centre for the trading of ECU-denominated financial instruments - also
failed to materialise. Early on, it became clear that neither Dutch
companies nor the Dutch state would be issuing enough ECU paper in the short
term to create the right conditions for a flourishing market segment.
'A lot has happened here,' says Jan Steinhauser, a former deputy-director of
the Dutch central bank who ran the 'Amsterdam Financial Centre' campaign.
'The action plan, with all its limitations, has achieved good things for the
Dutch financial community. Without it, the situation would have been
deplorable.'
However, Mr Steinhauser and other members of the financial community are
aware that the reforms and changes are not, in themselves, an iron-clad
guarantee that Amsterdam will continue to compete effectively.
To achieve that, the big institutions in Amsterdam - essentially the large
Dutch banks - must seize the new freedom for equity market-making and make
it happen.
Prices must be extremely competitive, and market liquidity must be more than
ample, if buyers and sellers of Dutch shares and bonds are to be persuaded
to do their business in Amsterdam rather than London.
Almost exactly a year ago, ABN Amro, the Netherlands's largest bank and
biggest single participant on domestic capital markets, caused a brief
flutter of anxiety when it announced plans to move the co-ordination of
world-wide equity sales, trading and research to London.
Louis de Bievre, member of the management board and head of investment
banking and global clients, said the bank had since managed to allay fears
that it was withdrawing support from the Amsterdam market. 'It is not at all
our intention to close down in the Netherlands and to operate solely from
London. We are a Dutch bank, and we will do our best to keep the Amsterdam
bourse strong for the shares that are traded here and to keep the market
competitive.'
Like other Dutch banks gearing up for the September 30 reforms, ABN Amro
believes the changes can help win back part of the equity business that now
takes place in London, mirroring Amsterdam's earlier success in recapturing
the initiative in government bond trading. 'I think that you will see the
same effect (in shares as in bonds),' Mr de Bievre said.
However, there are obvious limits to Amsterdam's ambitions. It may be able
to ward off London's encroachments, but it cannot supplant the UK capital's
role as the place where international financial flows come together in
Europe. For ABN Amro and other European banks, but perhaps for other Dutch
financial institutions in future, London is an obvious place from which to
co-ordinate a worldwide equity business. 'If we want to compete with our
peer group, we, too, must be in London,' he said.
Although the reforms that are about to take place at the stock exchange are
impressive enough, they are at least several years overdue. In fact, it had
been obvious since the 1980s that the bourse, which claims to be the world's
oldest with a history stretching back to the 17th century, was being
hamstrung by the limited resources of its stock jobbers, or 'hoekmen'.
Though required by bourse rules to be involved in virtually every
transaction that took place between two parties, the hoekmen were simply too
poorly-capitalised and too small to act as middle men in the sale and
purchase of shares and bonds.
The result was excessive costs and dwindling liquidity, two factors that
helped drive trading in Dutch bonds and shares to London.
Significantly, alarm bells began to ring in Amsterdam only after an
'outsider", the McKinsey consultancy firm, prepared a report showing the
extent to which trading had seeped across the English Channel.
This, in turn, helped concentrate the minds of all participants in
Amsterdam, leading to the painful but necessary decision to sacrifice a
large number of the traditional 'hoekman' and to convert the remaining firms
into 'market specialists'.
Change is always difficult in a 'co-operative' of member firms such as the
Amsterdam Stock Exchange.
With stock brokers, banks and old-styled jobbers possessing equal power
within the stock exchange, it is not surprising, perhaps, that consensus on
the need to change was so long in coming.
To remain well-prepared for the future, the bourse and its members will also
need to apply their minds to building new kinds of businesses to generate
income for the financial community as a whole. They will also need to find
new investors, especially among the Dutch public, who so far have not been
big buyers of shares.
Finally, Amsterdam still needs to increase the number of listed companies
from the varied ranks of the Nether-lands's family-owned or privately-held
corporations.
The June flotation of Koninklijke PTT Nederland, the Dutch
telecommunications and postal company, was the largest initial public
offering in the history of the Amsterdam bourse.
The government's first tranche raised nearly Fl 6.9bn (Dollars 3.9bn) and
attracted the attention of 188,500 private investors.
Nevertheless, the flow of new companies to the bourse has slowed to a
trickle in recent years, and so far the KPN flotation has not produced the
hoped-for bandwagon effect. Indeed, the recent flotation of Ballast Nedam,
the Dutch construction group previously owned by British Aerospace, simply
marked the return of a company that had once had a listing.
New blood is essential to Amsterdam. It will be getting an injection of
sorts in January when foreign banks and brokers, mainly of Anglo-Saxon
origin, begin to trade remotely on Amsterdam's new system from their offices
on the other side of the Channel.
But if it is to lead rather than follow, Amsterdam will have to rely in the
end on home-grown energy and talent.

MONDAY 12
Quebec provincial election
Opinion polls put the separatist Parti Quebecois well ahead of the ruling
Liberal party, although the current Quebec premier Daniel Johnson is more
popular than PQ leader Jacques Parizeau. If the PQ wins, it has promised to
call a referendum on independence from Canada for the French-speaking
territory within a year of taking office.
Peacekeeping: Nato's first peacekeeping exercises on former Warsaw Pact soil
start outside Poznan in western Poland as part of the Partnership for Peace
programme. For four days, 920 troops from 13 countries including the US,
Lithuania, the UK, Romania, Italy and the Ukraine will practise peacekeeping
operations at a cost of 20bn zlotys (USDollars 900,000). Russia, a PfP
member, declined to take part.
Abiola trial: The treason trial of Moshood Abiola is scheduled to resume in
the high court in the Nigerian capital, Abuja. Abiola is charged with
declaring himself president in June, a year after his unofficial victory in
the election which the army annulled. The trial was halted in mid-August
when the previous judge withdrew, saying Abiola lacked confidence in his
ability to conduct a fair hearing. However, the defence is asking for the
trial to be adjourned on medical grounds.
Non-proliferation: Delegates from more than 160 governments meet in Geneva
(to Sep 16) to prepare for a conference next year to decide whether to
extend the 1970 nuclear non-proliferation treaty and for how long.
North Korea: US assistant secretary of state Robert Gallucci arrives in
Japan for talks on North Korea's nuclear programme. He travels on to South
Korea on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, talks continue in Berlin between senior US and North Korean
officials (until Sep 14). The US diplomats had intended to propose providing
North Korea with light-water reactors and other technical assistance as an
incentive for North Korea to start negotiating the reduction of its nuclear
weapon capacity.
Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, visits Thailand at the start of an Asian
tour.
English counties: The Local Government Commission gives its recommendations
for future council structure in Gloucestershire - the final county to be
covered. The commission now starts public consultation, with final
recommendations for all of shire England due by the year-end.
FT Surveys: The Philippines and Dutch Finance and Investment.
Holidays: Switzerland (Zurich only).
TUESDAY 13
BIS gains board members
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, joins the board of the
Basle-based Bank for International Settlements. William McDonough, president
of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, also takes up a board position. As
a founding member, the US has been entitled to two board seats since 1930
but has never taken them.
Gordon Thiessen, Canadian central bank governor, and Yasushi Mieno, governor
of the Bank of Japan, also become BIS board members today. The BIS hopes the
moves, which bring to 11 the number of countries represented on the board,
will strengthen international monetary co-operation.
Japan and the UN: Boutros Boutros-Ghali, UN secretary-general, on a four-day
visit to Japan, meets prime minister Tomiichi Murayama. They will discuss
Japan's cautious moves towards a permanent seat on the UN Security Council.
Cabinet ministers will also meet separately to discuss the question.
Savoy ahoy: The UK luxury hotel group, which includes Claridge's and the
Connaught, as well as the Savoy itself, may have its future ownership
decided at today's board meeting. Last week, the departure was predicted of
Giles Shepard, Savoy managing director, who has bitterly resisted the
advances of Britain's Forte group which has been stalking it for 13 years.
The Savoy group announces its interim results on Wednesday.
US economy: The main data for August are released this week, starting with
the consumer price index today, with retail sales on Wednesday, and
industrial production on Friday. Following last week's above-forecast
increase in producer prices, inflation fears have increased and with them
the prospect of a near-term rate rise. Today's price index is expected to
rise by more than last month's 0.3 per cent.
Washington DC mayoralty: The Democratic party holds the primary ballot for
the position of mayor in the US capital. As the District of Columbia is idly
Democratic, the outcome will probably determine the victor in November's
ballot.
Favourite to win the nomination is Washington's former mayor Marion Barry,
who lost the job after 12 years in power when he was caught smoking crack
cocaine in a city hotel in 1990.
FT Survey: Sao Paolo.
WEDNESDAY 14
Polish debt reduction
Poland is due to sign a 49.5 per cent commercial debt reduction deal in
Warsaw with the London Club Steering Group, representing about 450
creditors. The agreement, reducing USDollars 14bn worth of debt, comes after
almost a year of talks and will, for the first time since 1981, regularise
Poland's financial relations with all its western creditors.
OECD leadership: The vexed question of who should lead the 25 nation
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is due for
consideration by ambassadors of member states to the OECD. The chances of a
consensus are unclear. Over the weekend, EU ministers rallied behind
Jean-Claude Paye, the present incumbent, who is seeking a new term from the
end of this month. But the US has stepped up its opposition to Paye. The
Clinton administration has been supporting Donald Johnston, a Canadian
politician, with support from other non-European countries.
Lloyd's of London is due to decide details of its strategy to collect
several hundred million pounds in debt from loss-making Names, the
individuals whose assets traditionally support the insurance market. Lloyd's
authorities said last month they were poised to hire commercial debt
collectors.
The European Parliament begins a two-day plenary session.
British Coal privatisation: Bidders for mining assets must submit tenders by
5pm today. The five regions are each likely to attract at least three bids.
Some of seven recently closed stand-alone pits will also attract interest.
UK economy: The retail price index and average earnings data will be
scrutinised for signs on whether the downward trend in UK inflation will
continue into the autumn. The annual rate of RPI is expected to have fallen
further in August, highlighting the low inflationary pressures in the UK
economy.
Saleroom: The costume that Charlie Chaplin wore in his 1940 film satire on
the rise of Hitler, The Great Dictator, is on offer, complete with swastika
armbands, at Sotheby's. It is expected to sell for about Pounds 30,000.
Key questions: The second World Piano Competition begins in London (to Sep
27). It is open to pianists of all nationalities under the age of 29.
Holidays: Israel (Eve of Yom Kippur).
THURSDAY 15
Ukraine's parliament meets
Ukraine's parliament opens its autumn session with economic reform at the
top of the agenda. Over the past month, President Leonid Kuchma has worked
behind the scenes to push Ukraine to meet conditions for international
assistance. The efforts to cut the deficit, liberalise prices and reform the
currency face tough opposition in a parliament dominated by anti-reformers.
If Mr Kuchma wants reform, he must court, or push out, the conservative
prime minister and parliamentary chairman, who make up the governing troika.
Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, arrives in Hong Kong. His visit
comes at a time when Sino-British co-operation over the colony appears to
have worsened. Hopes that Beijing would soon approve airport financing and
an extension of Hong Kong's container port have all but evaporated.
Saleroom: A recording of John Lennon playing with his first band, The Quarry
Men, at a church social in Liverpool in 1957 is expected to sell for more
than Pounds 100,000 at Sotheby's. It is the star lot in a pop memorabilia
sale which also includes Paul McCartney's manuscript lyrics of 'When I'm
Sixty-Four', which could make Pounds 38,000. An original Beatles bass
drumskin is expected to fetch up to Pounds 40,000.
FT Survey: Northern Ireland.
Holidays: Israel (Yom Kippur), Japan (Respect-for-the-aged Day).
FRIDAY 16
Hurd visits Japan
Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, arrives in Japan for a three-day
visit. He will meet prime minister Tomiichi Murayama, foreign minister Yohei
Kono, and a cross-section of senior officials and businessmen to talk about
international, regional and bilateral issues, including trade and political
relations.
Germany's Bundnis 90/Green Party starts a two-day meeting in Munich, one
week before Bavaria's state elections and less than a month from the federal
elections. The Greens, which merged with Bundnis 90 last year, got 3.8 per
cent of the vote in the 1990 federal elections.
Scot FM, a radio station for central Scotland, comes on air. It will be the
fifth regional station to be launched in the UK within a fortnight. The new
stations should boost commercial radio's 47.4 per cent share of total
listening.
UK economy: With the UK public sector's borrowing requirement now expected
to come below the Treasury's forecast of Pounds 36bn in 1994-1995, the
release of the monthly PSBR figure on Friday will be watched in the markets
for indications that the government's borrowing requirements are falling
further. Although July's PSBR of Pounds 1.1bn was sharply lower than the
City's expectations, August's PSBR is expected to rise to Pounds 2.1bn.
Holidays: Mexico (Independence Day).
WEEKEND 17-18
Swedes go to the polls
Sweden's Social Democratic Party, architect of the country's ubiquitous
welfare state, expects to return to government in Sunday's general election
after three years in opposition to a reformist right-centre coalition led by
the energetic prime minister Carl Bildt. Opinion polls over the past two
weeks suggest the party will fall short of a majority, raising the question
of where its leader Ingvar Carlsson will look for support in tackling
Sweden's budget deficit and 14 per cent unemployment.
Hong Kong goes to the polls on Saturday in its first fully democratic
election in 150 years of British rule. Voters will be choosing from 757
candidates to fill 346 seats in 18 district boards. These are the least
powerful of the colony's three tiers of government.
The Liberal Democrats, Britain's second opposition party, open their
conference at Brighton on Sunday (to Sep 22). Appearances by both the head
of the employers' organisation, the CBI, and the general secretary of the
trade union movement will underline its intention to remain distinctive. So
should debates on a top tax rate of 60 per cent for those earning more than
Pounds 100,000 a year, and a proposal to abolish the monarchy after the
present Queen's reign.

Monday: A spate of UK economic data will focus market attention on the
strength of the British recovery this week.
With the markets now wondering how long the low-inflation background can
continue, producer price data released today will be scrutinised for any
sign that manufacturers have succeeded in passing recent input price rises
on to their customers.
Tuesday: Last week's German GDP data has again focused attention on the
unexpectedly strong pick-up in the German economy.
July retail sales data due early this week are expected to show that
consumers remain relatively cautious, however, with retail sales forecast to
show a year-on-year fall of 0.5 per cent.
Wednesday: UK unemployment data are expected to show a continued fall in
unemployment levels.
Thursday: Meanwhile, UK retail sales figures are expected to indicate a drop
in the level of activity, amid growing market suspicions that the recent
growth in consumer spending may now be beginning to tail off, as April's tax
rises begin to bite into household budgets.

This week could prove to be highly volatile for gilts, as the markets
prepare for a spate of crucial UK data and digest the knock-on effects of
last week's turbulence on the US bond markets.
The key domestic figures will be the retail prices index and average
earnings data on Wednesday. Most analysts expect these to boost gilts by
confirming that UK inflationary pressures remain relatively low.
'I think the average earnings data will show that there has been a change in
psychology,' says Mr Nigel Richardson of Yamaichi International.
He argues that the low inflation outlook is making gilts increasingly
attractive to UK institutional investors and that they are likely to
outperform US and German bond markets in the coming weeks.
Nevertheless, as Mr Jonathon Loynes, of Midland Global Markets, points out,
UK gilts could still be depressed by international bond market turbulence,
particularly from the US, which is exerting more of an influence on gilts
than Germany.
A higher than expected US producer prices index last Friday revived concern
about US inflation and temporarily knocked up to 1 3/4 points off long-dated
gilts.
Some analysts warn that this could be repeated if Tuesday's US consumer
prices index is also high.

As Germans ponder for whom to vote in the October general election at a time
of accelerating economic recovery, the bond market is faced with a different
question.
Do German short-term interest rates have further to fall - however little -
or is the downward trend now over?
It is not an easy one to answer, especially in light of renewed US interest
rate rise fears caused by last Friday's wholesale price data.
Nor is it likely that this Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting will
provide any insights. The latest German economic data has reinforced the
views of those who expect no more cuts in the discount and Lombard rates.
Germany's recovery, they argue, needs no further help from interest rates.
Bundesbank directors were at pains to dampen speculation in the bond market,
thrown off course at the start of last week by comments suggesting no more
cuts were in the offing.
In the confusion, 10-year Bund yields approached 7.5 per cent. SG Warburg
said they could soon exceed 7.75 per cent but then tail off to 7.5 per cent
as funding pressures ease and political certainty returns.
Those seeing further rate cuts on the horizon point to falling money supply
growth and inflation, hopes of moderate wage rises, and a lower government
deficit but their optimism could be dashed by events in the US.

FT  12 SEP 94 / World Bond Markets: European integration back on the agenda
 -Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As European Union finance ministers held cosy fireside chats on economic and
monetary union near Lake Con-stance last weekend, the markets were fervently
hoping that they had not forgotten the lessons they had learnt over the past
few years.
With many countries in the EU now enjoying economic recovery, it was
inevitable that the push for European integration would once again become an
important issue on the political agenda.
But despite Emu's low profile during the past two years, the subject remains
a contentious one, as last week's speech Mr John Major, by the UK prime
minister, condemning the notion of a two-speed Europe, so clearly
illustrated.
As far as European bond investors are concerned, their main worry is that
French and German politicians will resume their quest for Emu and a single
currency without adequate consideration of the economic fundamentals.
'Economic union and political union have to move together. Whenever the
politicians moved too fast there was turbulence in the exchange rate
mechanism and in the bond markets,' said Ms Wendy Niffikeer, senior
economist at IBJ International. 'If the markets do not believe that Emu is
sustainable then it will break down.'
Recent proposals by Germany's ruling Christian Democrat party calling for
the creation of a 'hard core' of five nations - France, Germany, Belgium,
the Netherlands and Luxembourg - have set alarm bells ringing.
Analysts fear markets could be in for renewed volatility if the issue of a
two-speed Europe takes centre stage.
Mr Glenn Davies, economist at Credit Lyonnais in London, said: 'I have my
doubts about whether this factor is having much impact yet, but any country
that looked like it was going to be left out (of the inner core) would
suffer.'
Mr Ken Wattret, international economist at Midland Global Markets, agreed.
'If we do get an inner core, then a higher risk premium will be attached to
Italy, Spain and some of the Scandinavian countries which are likely to be
left out,' he said.
If some countries were to go forward without the others it would inevitably
lead to yield spreads widening between the high-deficit countries and the
inner core.
Although the UK has ruled itself out of Emu for now, because of sterling's
suspension from the ERM, its progress on inflation and reducing its budget
deficit would allow it to qualify for an inner core, analysts say.
As a result, some believe UK bond yields would not suffer if the UK decided
to remain outside Emu, either due to a lack of domestic political support or
because of the government's desire to hold on to a floating exchange rate.
'If the UK did not join in, this would not imply that gilt yields would have
to go as high as Italy's or Spain's,' said Mr David Miles, senior UK
economist at Merrill Lynch. He noted that by 1996, the UK's budget deficit
would be well below 3 per cent of gross domestic product, one of the
guidelines set down as a qualification for entry into Emu.
Yields on Danish bonds could also be protected against any widening.
Although Denmark has an opt-out from the third phase of Emu, it has said it
would meet the Maastricht convergence criteria by 1997, even if it did not
join the hard core.
As a result, Danish bonds would continue to be judged on fundamentals, said
Mr John Hall, European economist at Swiss Bank Corporation.
By contrast, Belgium's high budget deficit has cast doubts over its
eligibility to be part of an inner core. IBJ estimates its budget deficit is
likely to run at 5.8 per cent of GDP this year. However, the new government
has presented further savings.
The most obvious casualties would be the high-yielding bond markets of Italy
and Spain, which would suffer if investors believed their progress towards
economic convergence were insufficient.
'The question for Italy is fiscal policy. We feel Spain is doing well and
will continue to do well. But I don't think the risk-reward is attractive in
Italy,' said Mr Hall.
Meanwhile, some investors have been quick to look for opportunities created
by Emu's renewed publicity. Mr Hall said Ecu-denominated bonds would benefit
from any form of Emu, since the Ecu's status as the EU's single currency
would increase in importance.
'With Ecu bonds trading at 105 basis points over Germany and 50 over France,
that has to be good news for Ecu bondholders,' he said.
Before the CDU's proposals for an inner core were announced, the yield on
the 10-year Ecu bond was 16 basis points over its theoretical counterpart,
that had narrowed slightly to 14 basis points towards the end of last week.
After a difficult year so far, investors are hardly relishing the thought of
yet another factor which could destabilise bond markets. But with Germany
and France likely to be banging the drum ever louder for a two-speed Europe,
the issue is unlikely to go away.

<TEXT>
Increasing bearishness on the Tokyo stock market supported government bond
prices last week, and the yield on the 10-year benchmark bond fell 21 basis
points to close the week at 4.495 per cent.
Traders were also encouraged by comments from the Bank of Japan following
the release of the Tankan - the quarterly survey of business sentiment - and
statements by the Economic Planning Agency emphasising the fragile nature of
the recovery.
Although concern over profit-taking and over-supply persists, traders expect
the continued weakness of the stock market and low inflation data to prompt
bond buying by institutional investors.
Another likely support for bonds is the currency. Worries in the US over
rising inflation is likely to prompt selling of the dollar, in turn lifting
the yen.
A high yen, which leads to lower corporate profits and lower import
inflation, is likely to give the bond market a brief boost. However, traders
say fluctuations in the futures market do not provide evidence of a rally in
the near term.
'A move above Y109 would be required before the chart would look bullish,
and such a move over the next week may not be forthcoming, given that there
could still be some selling ahead of half-end book closings,' says Barclays
de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo.

Long-term US bond yields open this week within a whisker of their highest
level since the US interest rate cycle turned, and it will take some
encouraging consumer price figures on Tuesday to prevent them breaking
higher still.
The unexpectedly strong rise in core producer prices in August pushed the
yield on the long bond up by 14 basis point on Friday.
At 7.7 per cent, the yield ended the week just two basis points short of its
July peak.
The yield on two-year Treasury notes, meanwhile, climbed to a new high of
6.32 per cent as the market anticipated an acceleration in the Federal
Reserve Board's programme for tightening interest rates.
The chances of the Fed delaying until the November 15 meeting of its
policy-making committee seemed to recede.
Whether bonds lose further ground this week will depend largely on the
August consumer price index.
The general view is that higher petrol prices will push the index up by 0.4
per cent, the biggest monthly jump since early 1993.
Excluding food and energy, the index is expected to show a rise of 0.3 per
cent compared with July.
Among other figures for August due this week, the bond market will have an
eye on retail sales, due on Wednesday, and industrial production, on Friday.

FT  12 SEP 94 / World Bond Markets: Ireland finds progress difficult -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Given Ireland's recent impressive economic performance - high growth,
coupled with low inflation and a healthy government budget deficit - the
outlook for the country's government bond market should be bright. However,
until a better tone returns to other world government bond markets, progress
for the Irish market will be difficult.
Irish gilts have not been spared the dramatic fall in prices that has
afflicted most of the world's government bond markets in 1994. Since their
trough in February of this year, the yield on Irish gilts has risen by about
2.5 percentage points to 8.7 per cent.
The yield spread against Germany widened from 0.5 to 1.7 percentage points
between January and June, although it has since narrowed to about 1.2
percentage points as Irish gilts, in line with their British counterparts,
have outperformed the rest of Europe.
Yet the concerns that weighed down other markets, fear of rising inflation
and higher interest rates and worries about a flood of new bonds to fund
large government budget deficits, in the main part do not apply to Ireland.
High unemployment, strong productivity gains, and an incomes policy aimed at
restricting wage growth has kept the annual inflation rate at around 3 per
cent, with little risk of it moving higher. Cuts in public spending, tax
increases and economic growth have helped the government reduce its annual
budget deficit to a sustainable 2.3 per cent and make inroads into the stock
of national debt, although at 88 per cent of GDP this is still one of the
highest in Europe.
With about IPounds 50m to IPounds 100m of net gilt sales remaining for the
rest of this year out of a total of about IPounds 1.6bn, the Irish gilt
market has few supply worries.
The only credible concern for the Irish government bond market is that of
rising short-term official interest rates. The Irish monetary cycle is
closely linked to that of the UK and if the British authorities raise
interest rates, the Irish central bank will find it difficult not to follow
suit.
'The best we can hope for is that interest rates remain static for the rest
of 1994,' said Mr Alan McQuaid, economist at Goodbody Stockbrokers in
Dublin. 'Our view is that the UK will raise rates before the end of the
year. There may be some lag, but the strong link between the punt and the
pound means that Ireland will have to follow.'
That long-standing link between the Irish currency and sterling was
temporarily broken when Ireland joined the ERM in 1987 and the punt became
effectively pegged to the D-Mark.
'Ireland successfully adopted a monetary policy independent of the UK and
Irish gilts traded off bunds (German government bonds),' said Mr Alan
Sutherland, investment man-ager at Standard Life in Edinburgh. 'With the
break-up of the ERM in 1992, however, Ireland reverted to being a UK
satellite, with Irish gilts tracking UK gilts.'
Ireland's entry into the ERM also changed the make-up of the Irish gilt
market, a large proportion of which, about 25 to 30 per cent, has
traditionally been held by overseas investors.
While the punt tracked the D-Mark, long-term German investors were attracted
into the Irish market, holding about 20 to 25 per cent of government bonds.
With the demise of the ERM, however, they left, to be replaced largely by UK
and US investors, which along with continental European investors each hold
about 10 per cent of the Irish gilt market.
Ireland received a boost last month when Moody's, the credit rating agency,
upgraded the country's foreign debt rating to Aa2. The Irish authorities are
also attempting to improve the attractiveness to foreign investors of the
Irish government bond market.
As well as launching a new 10-year futures contract to be listed on the
Irish Futures and Options Exchange, they hope to improve liquidity by an
overhaul of government bond trading, replacing the current order-driven
system with a market-making system similar to that used in the UK.
The IRA ceasefire may also improve sentiment and focus the attention of
international investors on Ireland's favourable economic fundamentals.
However, any support these developments may provide will only become
apparent in the long run.
'They are all positive factors, but in the short run a lot will depend on
what happens in other bond markets, in particular in the UK gilt market,'
said one bond analyst. 'There's no getting away from the fact that what
happens in Ireland will continue to be dictated by what happens in the UK.'

Last Friday's US inflation figures, which were released after the local
market had closed, will be at the centre of attention today in the colony,
where the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to itse US counterpart and interest
rate movements are closely shadowed, writes Louise Lucas.
Brokers had been looking for the market to surge following last week's break
through the 10,000 level, buoyed by a return of liquidity.
Both Japanese and American money poured into the market last week, partially
oiled by the perceived improvement in US-China relations after the visit to
Beijing by the US commerce secretary, Mr Ron Brown.
Corporate issues will return to the fore towards the end of the week, when
the Jardine group kicks off its interim results.
Jardine International Motors reports on Wednesday, Dairy Farm on Thursday,
and Mandarin Oriental and Hongkong Land on Friday.
Market participants will be interested to see if the four elect to follow
the parent, Jardine Matheson, and Jardine Strategic Holdings, and delist
from the Hong Kong stock exchange in favour of the Singapore exchange at the
beginning of next year.

Japan Telecom's listing last week has left many investors wary of next
month's Japan Tobacco flotation, writes Emiko Terazono. Although the listing
is still six weeks away, domestic institutions are expected to start hedging
their positions by selling futures which is likely to prompt arbitrage
unwinding, depressing cash share prices.
Meanwhile, profit-taking by banks and corporations, wanting to boost profits
ahead of the interim book closing at the end of the month, is likely to
continue.
Analysts say banks are especially reliant on profits from their stock
holdings this time round since the recent fall in the bond market has
constrained them from realising profits on bond portfolios.

The market remains plagued by political developments. Crucial this week
could be a planned meeting between the prime minister, Mr Silvio Berlusconi,
and the trade unions which have threatened to strike over planned cuts in
government spending on pensions.
The market would like to see Mr Berlusconi take a firm line, and then win
the backing of his cabinet colleagues over the issue.

The market has been steadier during the past fortnight, after its the
weakness during the summer, with the better than expected half-year
statements from Roche and UBS providing the inspiration for the change of
heart.
The better mood faces another test on Thursday, when half-year profits
figures are due from Nestle, which last week announced the acquisition of
Warncke Eiskrem from Unilever as its first step into the German ice cream
market.
Half-year figures may also be on the way this week from Zurich Insurance and

Sweden goes to the polls next Sunday and the market is likely to remain
sensitive to the opinion polls during the coming week.
UBS notes that a series of polls last week showed support for the Social
Democrats, who had been expected to form a majority government, falling
below the previous 50 per cent of the total votes.
This begged the question of whether the Liberals, or Left and Greens, would
be required to support the incoming government.
The market, meanwhile, is hoping for the Liberals, who are seen as a
moderating influence.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Results
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
August saw the start of the European first-half results season, covering all
the main markets and touching each sector.
Mr Jerry Evans at Kleinwort Benson says that some early trends are becoming
clear. Of the 171 larger corporate results, profit growth averaged around 40
per cent. But from the initial figures, sector trends were hard to discern.
However, a large proportion of results came from the cyclical markets and a
comparison of capital goods figures suggested that results from the
engineering, metals, motors and chemicals sectors had been good or exceeded
already high expectations.
The banks' results were disappointing results , mainly due to bond losses,
while in the building sector the more competitive environment was to blame.
Pharmaceuticals, on the other hand, were disproving the bears, with
increasing sales growth.
Overall, while results had been good, they had not been outstanding.
This suggested, says Mr Evans, that Europe's volatile equity markets were
not going to be able to break free, for at least the next month or so, from
the present influence of bonds, which nervously await each economic
statistic.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Emerging Markets: Dollar stays focus of market attention -
Currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar will again be the focus of attention this week after its fall
last Friday in the wake of worse than expected August PPI figures.
A host of releases this week will provide the market with a clearer view on
the state of the US economy, and hence the likely outlook for US interest
rates and the dollar.
The dollar has been in a down trend ever since February, and few observers
expect this to reverse until US interest rates are seen to have reached a
plateau.
The prospect of rates rising puts a dampener on asset prices, and foreign
investors are likely to remain wary of buying US assets so long as the
prospect of rising interest rates looms.
The market thought US rates were on hold after the Fed lifted the discount
rate to 4 per cent, on August 16. But the PPI figures suggest they may have
to rise sooner than previously thought. The CPI tomorrow, and the retail
sales figures on Wednesday, will be the key releases.
Progress in US-Japan trade talks will also affect the dollar, as the
September 30 deadline for the implementation of trade sanctions draws
closer.
Upward pressure on the yen could be eased if, on Friday, the Japanese
cabinet authorises tax reforms which should stimulate consump-tion, possibly
curbing Japan's large current account surplus.
Markets will also keeping an eye on developments in Germany. On the
political front, the focus will be the run-up to the October elections. A
victory for Chancellor Kohl is firmly discounted, and this is adding lustre
to the D-Mark.
On the economic front, the focus is the Bundesbank council meeting on
Thursday. Council members have stressed that rates could fall further, but
analysts are not expecting changes this week.
Bubbling on the back burner will be the debate on a multi-tiered Europe,
which re-surfaced last week. It has the potential to bolster the currencies
of core European countries, at the expense of those with fiscal problems.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Bolivian utility prepares to erect a
milestone - International offerings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Cochabamba Light and Power Company (ELFEC) could be a surprising
addition to the London Stock Exchange in November if plans to list the
Bolivian electricity company's shares go ahead as planned.
The utility, valued at about Dollars 33m, is the first from Latin America to
seek a London listing in 'living memory,' according to the stock exchange.
More importantly it underlines a significant wider trend.
After a lull earlier this year Latin American companies - in sectors as
diverse as telecommunications, retailing and electricity - are again raising
capital from international investors.
And increasingly, the investment banks co-ordinating the issues are looking
beyond Mexico, Chile and Argentina - their favourite economies in recent
years - for potential candidates.
As recently as 1990 it was virtually impossible for Latin American companies
to raise international equity finance. Interest first took off with the
privatisation of Mexico's telecommunication company, Telmex, in 1991 and
last year Mexico and Argentina, another economy undergoing radical liberal
reforms, dominated the continent's new international issues, accounting for
over 80 per cent of the Dollars 6bn in international equity capital raised.
This year successive rises in US interest rates stemmed the flow. The
interest of US mutual funds, which fuelled growth in 1993, dropped off. A
series of developments, including the assassination of presidential
candidate Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, reminded investors of the political
risks.
Since July, however, interest has steadily returned. The governing party's
success in last month's Mexican elections helped buoy sentiment.
Governments in countries such as Peru have introduced liberal reforms with
some success. Above all there are hopes that stabilisation can be achieved
in Brazil following the fall in inflation after the introduction in July of
the Real currency plan. The plan's architect and former finance minister, Mr
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, is widely tipped to win next month's presidential
election.
Reflecting the new confidence, a string of new companies has come to the
market in recent weeks. By the end of July, Latin American companies had
raised a total of Dollars 3bn from international investors. At 47, the
number of issues compared with 52 for the whole of last year. Brazilian
issues such as Usiminas, the steel group, are among the country's first to
come to the market for more than two years.
Several Mexican issues are said to be in the pipeline. A number of Peruvian
issues, of which Banco Wiese, the country's second largest bank, is one of
the first, are also on the cards.
Bankers say many more smaller companies are seeking international equity.
The limit above which Chilean companies were allowed to seek international
capital was this year reduced from Dollars 50m to Dollars 25m.
'You are adding markets and broadening them within certain countries,' says
a New York investment banker, who has been involved in several issues.
Cochabamba is described as a 'Latin American Manweb,' by Mr Peter Earl of
Fieldstone of Private Capital Corporation, the investment bank helping
co-ordinate the listing and offer for sale. He says the issue will be one of
the first to be listed in La Paz. It follows the successful US
capital-raising exercise last year for the Bolivian Electric Energy Company.
A telling sign of the pace of activity is the competition among investment
bankers for the mandates. Fees have fallen sharply, especially in Brazil.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Outlook less certain after inflation scare -
New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After being caught off guard by Friday's inflation scare, investors may have
to rethink their strategies this morning in anticipation of tomorrow's
reading on consumer prices.
A fairly steady outlook for equities became less certain as last week drew
to close. Although most analysts had expected an upturn in the August
producer price index, Wall Street was approaching the announcement with what
proved to be a false sense of confidence. Stocks were expected to weather
any bad news with minimal damage.
In the event, share prices tumbled on news of a 0.6 per cent jump in the
PPI, a figure which far exceeded forecasts of an 0.4 per cent increase.
While Friday's 33 point decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average hardly
qualifies as a disaster, it was enough to give pause to those who had been
expecting the market to enjoy a robust autumn.
If this week brings evidence that inflation has been spilling over into the
consumer sector, the sell-off in stocks may accelerate, but if tomorrow's
figure comes in at about 0.4 per cent, as analysts had predicted before
Friday's PPI reading, then there is a good chance that share prices will
stabilise.
Economists were busy this weekend reconsidering their earlier estimates. Mr
Sung Sohn, chief economist at Norwest in Minneapolis, still believes the CPI
is likely to show a more modest increase than the PPI. The former, he points
out, is more sensitive to wage pressures, which have remained quite modest.
By contrast, the cost of raw materials, which heavily influence producer
prices, has risen sharply in recent months.
'It is still quite possible for stocks to do well if inflation is contained
at the producer level,' says Mr Thomas McManus, stock strategist at Morgan
Stanley in New York, in spite of the likelihood that the slide in bonds will
drag on for some time.
Mr McManus's view is based on increasing signs that the stock market has
entered a phase in which earnings, not interest rates, exert the strongest
influence on investor sentiment. Indeed, Friday's decline by stocks was
moderate when compared with the big losses suffered by the Treasury market.
'Companies are really starting to show investors that they have capitalised
on a weak dollar and all the restructuring that has been done over the past
couple of years,' he says.
That may prove to be a mixed blessing. Some observers believe Wall Street
has again grown complacent in the expectation of robust corporate profits in
the second half of the year.
'The market could well be building itself up for a big disappointment,' says
Mr McManus, who advises caution. His recommendation is to concentrate on
stocks which are directly benefiting from rising industrial prices, such as
chemicals, papers and metals.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Philippines
The Philippine Stock Exchange said that it was keeping a close watch on
dormant stocks to ensure they were not being used by companies wanting to
list assets without meeting listing requirements.
Early last week the PSE suspended trading in 10 of at least 20 inactive
firms being closely watched, and ordered them to explain rises of up to 50
per cent in their share prices in case they had failed to disclose 'material
facts' that could have fuelled speculation. The suspension of three of the
stocks was lifted last Tuesday.
Exchange officials said that they were concerned that small stocks might
become takeover targets for new groups wanting to get round listing
requirements. Most small board issues are mining and oil stocks.
Hong Kong
Luoyang Glass said on Wednesday that comments made by Mr Guo Xiaohuan, its
chairman and managing director, on the projected performance and profits for
the second half of 1994 should not be relied upon. China's largest sheet
glass maker said that the information had not been reviewed by its financial
advisers or auditors.
The Hong Kong stock exchange discourages company officials from making
results forecasts which have not been reviewed by independent financial
specialists. Nevertheless Luoyang's shares, which closed 4 cents lower at
HKDollars 3.89 on Tuesday, surged 17 cents, or 4.4 per cent, to HKDollars
4.06 on Wednesday.

this year. The fund will be listed in Dublin.
Mexico
Foreign investment in Mexican equities rose to Dollars 55.4bn at the end of
August, an increase of 8.5 per cent from the end of July. The Mexican stock
exchange (BMV) said that foreign participation in the Mexican market,
including money market instruments, rose to Dollars 80.7bn, 8.3 per cent up
on the previous month.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Emerging: Markets: Market seeks liquidity to join party -
The Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VINCENT BOLAND
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In a country with a seemingly unending flow of good economic news, capped in
July by an upgrading of its investment rating by Standard &amp; Poor's, the
Czech Republic's stock market has been noticeably unable to join the party.
A severe liquidity shortage, caused by a spate of rights issues from quoted
companies wishing to boost capital, has left the market drifting sideways.
Turnover has fallen sharply from levels seen seven months ago when the
market peaked, driven by strong domestic and foreign interest.
'Liquidity should improve after the shares in the second wave (of voucher
privatisation) are released,' says Mr Pavel Sobisek, head of capital markets
research at Zivnostenska Banka in Prague.
Some 860 companies are being sold in the second wave, which is due to be
completed before the end of the year.
In the first wave, launched in 1992 when the country was part of federal
Czechoslovakia, 185 investment privatisation funds (IPFs) received about 72
per cent of the vouchers from individuals. There are 349 IPFs involved in
the second wave, with 64 per cent of the vouchers.
Mr Sobisek believes that the combination of more IPFs, a greater number of
individuals who did not entrust their voucher points to the IPFs, and the
smaller number of companies is likely to lead to widely dispersed
shareholdings. 'Some of the funds taking part are too small to be long term
investors, and they will be forced to trade,' he says.
Turnover currently averages between Dollars 10m and Dollars 15m per trading
session, compared to up to Dollars 40m when the market peaked on February 1.
Share prices have collapsed, too. The widely quoted HN-Wood index of the top
30 shares is trading between 2,050 and 2,150, a long way from its peak of
3,805, though about 10 per cent above its low point of 1,836 on June 7.
Analysts agree that the favourable economic climate in the Czech Republic
provides a sound basis for the market to move ahead. Gross domestic product
is expected to rise by 2 per cent this year, reversing four years of
declines.
Unemployment, at 3.2 per cent in July, remains remarkably low. The rapid
growth of the services sector in the past three years has created thousands
of jobs to offset losses in traditional industries. Industrial output in
June grew by 3.3 per cent, and construction activity expanded 6.7 per cent
in the first half of the year.
Worries over a rise in inflation, however, have been fuelled by a big rise
in capital inflows. Last month the Czech National Bank revised its estimate
of net inflows to Kcs100bn (Dollars 3.4bn) from Kcs60bn and raised the
minimum reserve requirements of Czech banks from 9 to 12 per cent to dampen
its inflationary impact.
The CNB estimates that official reserves will reach Dollars 9bn (Pounds
5.8bn) by the end of the year, but it is confident that it can meet its
year-end inflation target of 10 per cent. Official reserves stood at a
preliminary Dollars 5.4bn in July.
Against this background, analysts say that the upgrading of the country's
investment rating by Standard &amp; Poor's from BBB to BBB+ in mid-July has
increased the attractions of investing in the Prague stock market to foreign
investors.
There is already evidence that they are slowly returning. Mr Alexander
Angell, director of sales and trading at stockbrokers Wood &amp; Co, says the
market has seen 'the first signs of German institutional interest' in the
last three months, much of it focused on the Czech Power Company (CEZ), the
biggest and most liquid stock on the market.
Mr Angell says there is also growing interest from specialist investment
funds and from 'some investors who may not be able to find the Czech
Republic on the map', such as dedicated traders, mainly US-based, in
closed-end investment funds, which are behind a sharp rise in the share
prices of some of the quoted IPFs.
Trading in IPF shares accounted for up to 40 per cent of market turnover
over the past three months, and dealers say about Dollars 40m was ploughed
into the funds by outside investors in that period.
The interest is mainly in those IPFs - such as Harvard Dividend and Growth
Funds, IPF Creditanstalt, and the IPFs run by Ceska Sporitelna and Komercni
Banka, the two biggest Czech banks - seen as having quality portfolios and
good management, and which trade at substantial discounts to net asset
value.
Dealers say that the IPFs offer the best means of getting wide exposure to
the Czech economy, and that more selective buying will have to await the
ending of the privatisation programme.
Meanwhile, the Prague stock market is set to move to daily trading from
September 19 in an attempt to increase turnover and attract more business
from the RM-System, a rival exchange which has a nationwide network of
branches and affiliated brokerage houses.
The PSE currently trades on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays, while the RM-S
offers continuous trading. The RM-S, a privately owned company, was set up
to capitalise on the voucher privatisation programme, and has been the main
forum used by thousands of small shareholders to trade in shares.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Analysts still see further rise this year -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a stock market suddenly under attack on its two most sensitive fronts -
interest rate prospects and company trading statements - analysts' nerves
appear to be holding up well.
The consensus is still that the market has further to advance this year,
even if base rates are almost certain to rise and the corporate reporting
season has shown it can deliver disappointments as well as delights.
The BTR shocker has been a reminder that general manufacturing earnings have
not yet regained pre-recession highs and that these sectors had, in any
event, a great deal of ground to recover.
As Kleinwort Benson points out, and BTR admitted, the sharp drop in global
inflation rates bears testimony to 'a stifling pricing environment'. At the
same time, costs are threatened by rising raw material prices and pockets of
skill shortage.
Meanwhile, the absence of dramas following the monthly meeting between the
chancellor of the exchequer and the governor of the Bank of England has left
the outlook for base rates unchanged. 'UK rates (are) likely to rise by
November,' says Goldman Sachs flatly - but then adds that any equity
weakness presents a buying opportunity.
A similar view is taken by Charterhouse Tilney, where Richard Jeffrey
believes higher base rates would be positive for equities by steadying the
gilt-edged market. 'At this stage of the recovery, a tightening is not to be
feared,' he says.
Charterhouse believes company profits have 'significantly' more to benefit
from economic recovery. Smith New Court takes this a stage further by
insisting the cyclical sectors, construction, chemicals, engineering and
building materials companies, have been abandoned too soon by investors
fearful recovery may slacken.
'Our view is that the economic upswing will be more prolonged than is
generally anticipated and that cyclicals are a long way from peaking out,'
the firm says. It believes under-performance by the cyclicals, largely
reflecting interest rate worries, overlooks an uptrend in share price
relatives of European cyclical stocks.
Smith endorses the view of many in London that rate rises are unlikely to
reverse these trends. Its argument would also question the knee-jerk rush
back towards the defensive sectors - utilities, food manufacturing and
healthcare - seen on Friday afternoon. Earnings estimates in those sectors
are still on a downturn, and 'outperformance . . . is probably a selling
opportunity'.
None of this will protect the stock market against further shocks in the
near term, either in the shape of more interest rate-threatening statistics
from the US or discomforting trading reports from British companies.

FT  12 SEP 94 / The Markets: Signs point to start of a benign phase - Global
Investor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Month by month, the satisfying hum of economic recovery is spreading through
the industrialised world. The euphonious tone was first heard two years ago
in the US and has moved slowly through the English speaking-world.
In the first half of this year it has, quite suddenly, resounded through
continental Europe, and its faint echo can even be recognised in Japan. Over
the summer, economists' forecasts have been trying unsuccessfully to keep up
with the published output figures. At the beginning of the year, most were
forecasting G7 growth of a niggardly 1.5 per cent for 1994. At the last
count the consensus was close to 3 per cent.
Strikingly, in most countries the recovery has been driven not by
consumption, but by industrial production. Factory output in the G7
countries grew at an annualised rate of 6.3 per cent in the first six months
of the year. In western Germany it is growing at an annual rate of 10 per
cent. France is not far behind. Admittedly much of that extra output has not
left the warehouse yet, as stocks have risen sharply, but the turn-round is
still remarkable.
Even more encouraging is the fact that the dramatic upswing in activity
seems to be largely trade-related. Estimates vary, but the net increase in
world trade this year could be as high as 8 per cent, the best figure since
the late 1980s. That bodes well for a sustainable, widespread recovery.
What does all this mean for the global investor, especially one with a
nervous eye on the equity markets? The central question is whether the
higher corporate earnings which the quickening recovery will undoubtedly
bring will be outweighed by the rising interest rates that will just as
inevitably follow. The key lies in inflation.
Two years of strong growth in the US are clearly bringing capacity problems.
By any conventional estimate the US has either closed, or is near to
closing, its output gap - the difference between trend and actual rates of
growth. Capacity utilisation is high, and last week a leading Federal
Reserve Board member mused publicly that the unemployment level was close to
its 'natural rate,' below which there is only accelerating inflation. Last
Friday's producer price figures confirmed many analysts' worst fears.
Other countries are less advanced in the cycle, but even in Germany there
are worrying signs of early capacity constraints. So there can be little
doubt that nearly all of the leading economies have reached the bottom of
their interest rate cycles. But that does not necessarily spell the end for
equities. What most affects stock markets is long-term interest rates, and
there is good reason to believe that they may not rise much further for some
time to come.
The collapse in bond prices in the first six months of the year has given
the yield curve an unusual gradient. In Europe and Japan the ratio of
10-year bond yields to 3-month money market rates is now well above
historical averages - in Japan's case the bond yield is unprecedentedly high
at twice the short interest rate. This will not last.
Bond prices fell and yields rose for two main reasons - investors were
expecting higher inflation and were discounting higher short-term rates. The
rise in short rates (at least in the early stage of this recovery) is thus
already mostly discounted. And the inflationary fears are likely to be eased
further as confidence grows that central banks will respond to signs of
inflation.
The US experience is instructive. This year's increases in short-term rates
have not been followed by a rise in bond yields. In fact, after last month's
increase, long rates actually fell slightly, tipping the yield curve back
further towards a more normal gradient.
Of course as short rates rise much further, long bond yields are also likely
to drift upwards again, but not immediately, and not at the same pace, as
the yield curve starts to flatten. So interest rates have bottomed out, but
the rise in short rates should be slow; the rise in longer rates, much of
which has already occurred, should be even slower.
That leaves earnings growth. Is there any reason to doubt that it will not
fully reflect the recovery? Some have argued that companies will have
difficulty in passing on price increases since consumption remains subdued,
though how this squares with fears about inflation will have to remain a
mystery.
Much more likely is a strong cyclical recovery in earnings - continuing in
the US, accelerating in the UK and starting in the rest of Europe and Japan.
And that recovery should have some way to go.
Evidence suggests that a profits recovery lives on well past a turn in the
interest rate cycle. New research by the UK stockbrokers, James Capel shows
that in Europe stock markets have risen strongly following the trough in
interest rates in all cycles since 1975. The analysis shows that average
earnings were 14.6 per cent higher two years after rates had bottomed out.
In short the likelihood is that we are now entering that benign phase of the
markets' cycle where interest rates rise along with equities, driven by the
rapid growth in profits associated with recovery.
The really good news is that faster-flowing trade should help even more. And
this time an unusual synchronicity of global economic performance may make
the performance even stronger than usual. Of course it will also probably
make the fall that much greater in the next phase of the cycle, when
interest rates are still rising, but markets fall. But those demons should
be put away for another day.

FT  12 SEP 94 / The Markets: Marital economics - Economic Eye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1991 there was one divorce in the UK for every two marriages, twice the
rate in 1971. More than 30 per cent of all births were outside marriage in
1992, six times as many as in 1961. More than a half of those births were
registered by the mother alone or by couples living apart (see chart).
Finally, lone-parent families were a fifth of all families with dependent
children in 1992, up from a mere 4.5 per cent 30 years before.
Patterns of marriage and child-rearing have been revolutionised in just one
generation. Why has this happened? Economics can help provide answers, for
marriage is an economic institution: a partnership to rear children.
The characteristics of child-rearing make this partnership necessary.
Directly or indirectly, child-rearing is the greatest expense most adults
bear; an upbringing that equips children for success takes at least 20
years; and a parent can hardly look after children full-time, while earning
an adequate living. Sole-parents need someone to look after their children,
if they work, or resources from somewhere else, if they do not work. They
can manage the first, unaided, only if their earning power is substantially
greater than the cost of childcare. That would make them exceptional, by
definition. Sole parents can enjoy the second, unaided, only if they are
wealthy, which would make them still more exceptional.
The main problem faced by single-parent households is, it is argued, that
they are poor. While true, this misses the point. That is precisely why
people have found it necessary to combine their resources, including their
time, in order to bring up their children.
Marriage regulates this partnership. Its essential feature is enduring
commitment. This matters because a parent who forgoes future earning
opportunities for the sake of children is taking a large risk. Marriage is
worthwhile to the extent that it binds future behaviour. The easier divorce
becomes, the less reason to marry. So one reason for a more than three-fold
increase in the proportion of children born outside wedlock is that it is
'just a piece of paper'.
Marriage may no longer embody an enduring commitment. But having children
does. To understand the implications, forget gender neutrality, since the
tastes of the two sexes evidently diverge. One has a greater preference for
having and looking after children. The other has a greater preference for
partners who are young. These differences may be the product of
conditioning, or they may be biological. It does not matter for this
analysis, provided they exist.
Set these differences against the nature and costs of child-rearing, the
fact that children are consumption rather than investment goods and the
disappearance of the binding element in marriage. What are the implications?
First, women are bound to end up as the caring parents, because men will
exploit them: in 1991, 94 per cent of lone-parent families with dependent
children were headed by women. Second, men who gain little pleasure from
their children will see little benefit to themselves in bearing the costs,
particularly if doing so reduces their attraction to other women. Third,
women will limit the size of their families to what they find enjoyable.
Perhaps the most important implication, however, is that the choice of mate
matters more to women than to men, because they end up with the irreversible
commitment: the one to their children. Men may propose, but women dispose.
The least they will want is someone able and (ostensibly) willing to provide
the resources needed for rearing their children.
Unfortunately, the proportion of such men is in decline. The labour force
participation rate for men aged 15 to 64 shrank from 93 per cent to 83 per
cent between 1973 and 1993. There has also been a big increase in the
inequality of male earnings. In the late 1980s the ratio of the earnings of
men in the top 10 per cent of earners to that of those in the bottom 10 per
cent was 3.4 to one. In the late 1970s it had been only 2.4 to one. Women
are competing for a reduced pool of useful husbands. The unsurprising result
is polygyny (multiple matings by men), mostly serial.
The female search for men with significant earning potential matches the
male yearning for younger partners. For the past 20 years the rate of
marriage by widowers and divorced men (as a proportion of widowers and
divorced men) has exceeded that for bachelors, while the reverse has been
true for women: the remarriage rate for widows and divorced women is less
than half the marriage rate for spinsters. These differences are sexist and
ageist: the positive gap between male and female re-marriage rates appears
in the 30 to 34 age group and increases rapidly thereafter. So successful
older men find new partners; their former spouses, unless divorced young,
become single-parents; second families compete for limited resources with
first ones; and less successful men enjoy little chance of marriage.
It is possible then to explain the increase in the choice of sole-parenthood
by women from poorer classes. It is also possible to explain the rise of
serial polygyny. But most women can still not bring up their children
unaided and most men cannot - and, even if they can, do not wish to -
support more than one family, unaided. There has to be another actor. That
actor is the welfare state. The hated Child Support Agency was an attempt by
the government to re-privatise costs that had been socialised. Why this has
been tried and why it is failing will be the subject of a second column.

FT  12 SEP 94 / The Markets: Metals set for a quiet week - Commodities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Metals markets are likely to be quieter than usual this week because many
aluminium traders have made their way to Paris for the annual Metal Bulletin
aluminium conference which opens this morning.
Meanwhile, many copper traders have descended on New York to attend the
annual Metals Week copper conference, followed tomorrow evening by the
Copper Club dinner.
Aluminium traders will not give all their attention to the distinguished
speakers in Paris until they have seen today's statistics from the
International Primary Aluminium Institute, giving stock figures for the end
of July. These are expected to provide more evidence that the unprecedented
international trade agreement, encouraging aluminium producers to cut
output, is having an increasing impact on the huge surplus that depressed
prices for so long.
Between February, when delegates from six big aluminium producing areas
signed a 'memorandum of understanding' about production cuts, and the end of
June, producer stocks fell by 141,000 tonnes, or 6.6 per cent.
London Metal Exchange stocks have also fallen - by 104,000 tonnes in July,
the biggest single monthly fall since the exchange launched its aluminium
contract.
If IPAI stocks also are shown to have fallen in July, it will be only the
second time in four years that both IPAI and LME stocks fell in tandem.
Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, suggested: 'The memorandum of
understanding clearly is working. But the industry still has a big task
ahead.' Stocks were still equivalent to 16 weeks of consumption and they
needed to be 6 1/2 weeks before producers could relax. So another 2.8m
tonnes - or 40 per cent - had to be cut from combined IPAI and LME stocks of
4.8m tonnes.
Also this week, Dalgety, the agricultural merchant, on Thursday gives its
annual harvest review, while on Friday the Opec quota compliance committee
meets to discuss August oil production figures.

FT  12 SEP 94 / International Company News: Texaco bid to buy rest of
Canadian unit fails
</HEADLINE>

   By RICHARD WATERS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Texaco has failed to buy out the minority shareholders in its Canadian
subsidiary, Texaco Canada Petroleum.
The US energy group's offer for the 22 per cent of the company it did not
already own was rejected by 84 per cent of the minority shareholders in a
vote on Friday.
It needed more than 50 per cent of holders to accept the Dollars 1.40 a
share offer to succeed. Texaco's failure followed a dispute over the
Canadian company's value.
Canadian 88 Energy, an independent company holding 9.8 per cent of the
shares, had offered to buy Texaco's shares in its subsidiary for Dollars
1.65 a share. But Texaco maintained its offer was fair and was based on the
advice of two independent financial advisers.
The rejection is a setback for Texaco ahead of its expected move to expand
its Canadian operations. The US company once had one of the biggest oil and
gas businesses in Canada, but sold the bulk for Dollars 5bn at the end of
the 1980s.
The attempt to buy out the minority shareholders was seen as a tidying-up
exercise ahead of renewed growth.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The launch of the Chicago Board of Trade's answer to Globex, an after-hours
computer trading system known as Project A, has been delayed again. The
system is now expected to make its debut the third week in September.
The CBoT, which is home to the actively traded US Treasury bond futures and
options markets, pulled the plug on Globex, the electronic futures trading
network owned by Reuters and operated jointly by the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange and Matif, last May.
Since then, it has announced ambitious plans to link its own Project A
system with other after-hours computers in London and Australia.
However, the exchange has had difficulty getting the product launched on its
own turf. Originally scheduled to open trading on August 1, Project A was
delayed at the request of some CBoT members, who wanted a complete system
audit.
Deloitte &amp; Touche, the international accountancy firm, gave the system a
clear report in late August. Now, the CBoT is waiting for its regulator, the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission to review the auditor's report and give
its approval for the Project A launch.
The exchange already meets much of the demand for its products outside the
US time zone with its evening open-outcry trading session, which last month
had turnover of 229,510 contracts.
When Project A is launched it will initially open for only two hours in the
afternoon, bridging the gap between the close of the CBoT's afternoon
session and the opening of its evening session.

FT  12 SEP 94 / International Company News: Profits ahead at Pacific Dunlop
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pacific Dunlop, the Melbourne-based industrial conglomerate, has reported a
16.8 per cent rise in profits after tax and abnormal items to ADollars
303.5m (USDollars 226m) for the year to June.
The result was scored on sales up by 9 per cent, to ADollars 7.07bn, and
included a pre-tax abnormal item of ADollars 4.88m, down from ADollars 9.53m
previous-ly.
Earnings per share, before abnormal items, were up by 13.6 per cent to 28.4
cents. The final dividend is 11.5 cents a share against 11 cents, making a
total for the year of 22.5 cents compared with 21.5 cents.
All five main industrial divisions - ranging from automotive products to
healthcare - showed advances but the largest group, building and
construction, only saw a marginal increase in operating profits, from
ADollars 148m to ADollars 149m. Pacific Dunlop said the results were
'creditable in very competitive markets'.
On a geographical basis, Australia accounted for ADollars 333m of operating
profits, compared with ADollars 330m, and south-east Asia and New Zealand
chipped in ADollars 96m, largely unchanged from the previous year's ADollars
94m. A bigger advance came in the US, contributing ADollars 133m against
ADollars 103m, and Europe, with ADollars 25m against ADollars 16m.
Shell Australia is to go ahead with the flotation of its gold and other
mineral assets as a separate company. A prospectus is to be lodged by the
end of this month. It expects to raise ADollars 400m from the float.
The new unit will take in a 30 per cent interest in the Boddington gold mine
in Western Australia, full ownership of the Union Reefs gold mine and the
Sunrise Dam gold project, and 40 per cent of the Central Desert joint
venture.

FT  12 SEP 94 / International Company News: Banesto sells stake in zinc
group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Corporacion Banesto, the Spanish industrial holding company, has sold 23 per
cent of Asturiana de Zinc (Azsa), Europe's largest zinc producer, for
Pta10.6bn (Dollars 82.6m) to a group of international investors for Pta1,500
a share, reducing its stake to just over 50 per cent.
The sale represents the third large disinvestment in less than two months by
La Corporacion, whose parent Banco Espanol de Credito Banesto, was acquired
this year by Banco Santander in a Dollars 2bn takeover.
AB Asesores, a Madrid investment bank, Germany's Deutsche Bank and Robert
Fleming of the UK managed the Azsa disposal.
Banesto said La Corporacion policy was to dispose of its assets gradually as
price opportunities arose. 'We are overhauling the management of all the
companies controlled by the holding company and we are not conducting a fire
sale for any of the companies.'
The mining company, exposed both to the cyclical price of zinc and to the
dollar-peseta exchange rate, reduced its losses by 47 per cent to Pta2bn in
the first half of this year and is forecast to post 1994 losses of Pta4.4bn,
against losses of Pta8.3bn last year. Analysts expect the company to break
even next year.

FT  12 SEP 94 / International Company News: Inmarsat to form global network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Inmarsat, the London-based international mobile satellite communications
organisation, will this week launch an affiliate company to build a global
personal mobile satellite telecommunications system.
The company, one of several ventures seeking to construct a personal mobile
satellite network, aims to raise Dollars 1bn in equity from Inmarsat's 75
members by the end of the year to fund the first stage of development and
construction.
The network is intended to be operational by 2000. It will require 12
intermediate-orbit satellites, terrestrial tracking stations, and commercial
partnerships with manufacturers and service providers.
The total cost is estimated at Dollars 2.6bn. In addition to the Dollars 1bn
of initial equity, the new company will be seeking a further Dollars 400m
from strategic partners among satellite and handset manufacturers. No public
flotation is planned.
Mr Olof Lundberg, Inmarsat's director-general, said the project was 'bold
and ambitious', aiming to service a 'significant niche' opening up in the
mobile communications market.
Customers for the new network would include international business
travellers and local operators wanting to supply telecoms services to areas
without adequate infrastructure.
The most advanced of Inmarsat's rivals are Iridium and Globalstar, both of
which claim to have raised significant investment sums. Iridium's Dollars
3.4bn project was conceived by Motorola, the US-based electronics group; the
Dollars 1.8bn Globalstar project is being developed by Loral, the US defence
group, and Qualcomm.
Although the design of their networks - including the level at which the
satellites orbit - varies, the three operators are aiming to provide similar
services. With development at an early stage, analysts are cautious as to
the prospects of all three operators surviving until launch.
Inmarsat uses five operational satellites to provide services to 40,000
customers, most of them in its specialist maritime and aeronautical markets.
It views personal mobile communications as a critical growth market.
Iridium will be based on a constellation of 66 small 'Leo' satellites.
Handsets for all the networks will be dual-mode, allowing calls to be made
on local cellular networks where available.
A year ago, Motorola raised Dollars 800m from an international consortium,
including Raytheon, Lockheed and Sprint of the US, Bell Canada and 18
Japanese companies including Sony and Mitsubishi as a first stage towards
financing Iridium.
More recently, a group of Indian financial institutions agreed to invest
Dollars 32m in Iridium, and Comsat, the US satellite operator, is understood
to be discussing investing Dollars 70m to acquire a stake in the project.

FT  12 SEP 94 / International Company News: Rapid rise for Ford descendant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Financial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The possibility that a member of the Ford family will one day take over the
top job again at the US motor vehicle manufacturer increased last week with
the elevation of a great-grandson of founder Henry Ford to a senior position
in the company, writes our financial staff.
William Clay Ford II, 37, was named as the next head of the company's
important finance committee.
He will take over the job from his father, also named William Clay Ford, on
January 1 next year.
William Clay Ford II was also named a member of the company's organisation
review and nominating committee.
His appointment was seen as a sign of a rapid rise within the company,
potentially setting the stage for William Clay junior to become the first
Ford family member to run the US's second-biggest manufacturer of vehicles
since Henry Ford II, a grandson of the founder, stepped down in 1979.
The company's finance committee has been chaired by members of the Ford
family since Henry Ford II took on the job in 1979.
The role passed to his brother, William Clay senior, after his death in
1987.

FT  12 SEP 94 / International Company News: ITT to launch L400bn offer for
Ciga next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITT, the US conglomerate which owns the Sheraton hotel chain, will launch
its L400bn (Dollars 254m) bid for a further 35.25 per cent of Ciga, the
Italian luxury hotels group, on September 19.
The terms of the bid, which will be made through ITT's Sheraton
International subsidiary, were outlined on Saturday.
If successful, the L1,102 a share offer will double ITT's stake in Ciga to
70.5 per cent. Certain Italian fund managers, however, have already
indicated that they would prefer to remain minority shareholders. Ciga
shares closed on Friday night at L1,076.
Consob, the Italian stock exchange watchdog, first announced that ITT would
have to bid at the end of July. Since then the US company has bought further
Ciga shares on the market at below L1,100.
In the full-page prospectus, published at the weekend, ITT said its
management plans would be 'better defined in the coming months'. However, it
said it wanted to 'explore the potential synergies between Ciga Hotels and
ITT Sheraton.
'ITT Sheraton can offer Ciga Hotels the benefit of a global marketing and
distribution network, which Ciga did not have previously. Furthermore, ITT
Sheraton can integrate Ciga into the financial and operating systems already
used by the ITT group.'
Ciga was controlled by the Aga Khan's holding company, Fimpar, until a
rescue rights issue earlier this year, prepared by Mediobanca, the
Milan-based merchant bank, on behalf of the debt-encumbered group's creditor
banks.
ITT was unable to acquire Ciga via that issue, as originally planned, and
has had to accumulate shares on the market.
The ITT bid, which will close on October 7, could end more than a year of
uncertainty about the future of Ciga, which was courted last year by Forte
of the UK and Host Marriott of the US. Sheraton International is advised by
Euromobiliare and Milla.
Meanwhile, the Aga Khan is due to decide this week how much he can afford to
pay to bail out Fimpar, which urgently requires new capital.
Reports at the weekend suggested he was ready to underwrite an increase in
capital to the tune of L24.5bn, but that he would not pay the entire sum at
once. Fimpar has postponed today's extraordinary shareholder meeting, due to
consider the group's future, until September 19.

Two of South Africa's biggest fruit exporters, Unifroco and Outspan, are to
merge their European operations into a new company called Capespan, writes
Mark Suzman in Johannesburg.
Last year the combined export sales of the two companies exceeded R2.5bn
(Dollars 554m).
The two will have an equal share of Capespan, which will be based in the UK.
Their subsidiary offices throughout Europe will be merged and put under
Capespan's control.
The new company plans to operate a combined marketing season of 50 weeks,
compared with Unifroco's 35 weeks and Outspan's 25 weeks.

FT  12 SEP 94 / International Company News: Amexco to pay Dollars 375m for
Thos Cook units
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
American Express is expected to announce today that it has acquired the
international business travel operations and US travel agencies of Thomas
Cook for about Dollars 375m (Pounds 241.9m).
The deal will confirm American Express as one of the world's two big
business travel groups, alongside Carlson of the US and Wagonlit of France,
who agreed to combine their business travel operations last March.
The sale of its business travel operation will allow Thomas Cook to
concentrate on its three remaining activities: leisure travel agencies
outside the US, foreign exchange and traveller's cheques.
The purchase of the US travel agencies business is a separate transaction.
The US business is owned by Mr David Paresky, who operates under a franchise
agreement with Thomas Cook. Thomas Cook was prevented by US banking laws
from operating the business itself, because it is owned by Westdeutsche
Landesbank.
The expected Dollars 375m purchase price represents the payment to both
Thomas Cook and Mr Paresky. It is not known how it is divided between the
two transactions.
Thomas Cook is thought to have decided that it did not have the resources to
compete in the international business travel market.
Purchasing airline tickets and booking hotel rooms for corporate customers
will require an increased investment in computer technology over the next
few years.
Unlike American Express, Thomas Cook does not have a charge or credit card
to offer business travellers.
The ability to provide clients with a plastic card to use on their trips has
become an increasingly important part of the business travel service.
Carlson and Wagonlit have said that they hope to negotiate an agreement with
a card issuer.
Thomas Cook said last month that it wanted to increase its involvement in
the traveller's cheque business when it acquired Interpayment Services, the
world's largest issuer of Visa traveller's cheques, from Barclays Bank.
The acquisition, for an undisclosed consideration, raised Thomas Cook's
share of the Dollars 54bn world-wide traveller's cheque market from 17 to 30
per cent. This put it in second place behind American Express, which has 44
per cent.
Thomas Cook is also thought to have had discussions about buying the
traveller's cheque operations of Citicorp. Citicorp, the only other issuer
of traveller's cheques of any size, has 12 per cent of the market.

FT  12 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Lucas completes strategic review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lucas Industries yesterday said Mr George Simpson, its new chief executive,
had completed a five-month strategic review aimed at refocusing the
aerospace and automotive components manufacturer.
The company, however, played down weekend reports that the plans would lead
inevitably to plant closures, redundancies and the disposal of non-core
businesses.
Under the proposals, the group will focus on six products areas - aerospace,
electronics, brakes, diesel systems, electrical systems and automotive
aftermarket - but the board has yet to decide on the form of any
restructuring.
Mr Simpson, the former Rover Group chairman, first outlined his vision last
month at a meeting of senior managers, at which he voiced concern at Lucas's
'inadequate' financial performance and stressed the need for better customer
relations.
He told them that to achieve long-term growth the group had to concentrate
on added-value products such as aerospace equipment and electronics rather
than low cost components.
The group's full year results are due on October 10.

FT  12 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Institutions cool on UK equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK institutional investors are losing some of their enthusiasm for British
equities, as well as those from Japan, according to the lastest Smith New
Court/Gallup survey of fund managers.
The survey, conducted among 91 institutions in early September, found that
only 15 per cent of respondents planned to increase their exposure to UK
equities, down from a six-month high of 20 per cent in July. Only 21 per
cent of respondents planned to increase their Japanese equities investment,
down from 48 per cent in July.
The investor demand for property investment appears to be tapering off as
well, with only 1 per cent of respondents saying they wish to increase their
holdings, down from 14 per cent, the six-month peak, in May.
On the overall UK economic front, nearly two thirds of respondents say they
expect conditions to 'get a little better' over the next 12 months, with
another 20 per cent predicting they will remain unchanged. On the inflation
front, 77 per cent see inflation rising more rapidly in the next 12 months.
On continental Europe, respondents have increased their forecasts for German
interest rates, saying they expect the Bundesbank's key rate for repurchase
agreements to rise to 5.1 per cent in one year's time from its current level
of 4.85 per cent.
In the light of that forecast, not surprisingly, just over half of all
respondents said they favoured French equities over German equities.
France ranked as the Continental market in which investors most wanted to
increase their exposure, while Germany was the market in which investors
most wished to decrease their exposure.
UK pension fund managers believe Asia Pacific and South America offer the
most attractive investment areas over the next decade, according to a survey
by Record Treasury Management, the currency hedging specialists.

In an important expansion of investment opportunities in the move into
global emerging markets, Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull is launching an
investment trust aimed at expected capital growth in information
infrastructure in emerging economies in Asia, Europe and Latin America.
BZW Investment Management will manage the fund, to be named The
Infostructure Trust, which is initially aimed at a minimum total investment
of about Pounds 40m although this figure is likely to become very much
greater, depending on the response to the offer.
The fund will hold shares, mostly in companies quoted on emerging stock
markets and which operate across the full range of the information industry,
including advertising, publishing and telecommunications, newspapers, and
education, as well as electronic software and hardware.
The issue, in the form of an institutional placing and public offering of
ordinary shares with warrants attached, will be sterling dominated and
listed in London.
Trading in the shares is expected to start in November.

FT  12 SEP 94 / UK Company News: TLG planning autumn debut - Former Thorn
EMI offshoot likely to be valued at more than Pounds 225m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TLG, the holding company for the Thorn Lighting group, is planning to come
to market later this autumn through a placing and public offer likely to
value the former Thorn EMI subsidiary at more than Pounds 225m.
The flotation of TLG, Europe's second largest supplier of professional
lighting equipment and systems after Philips of the Netherlands, will be one
of the biggest in a busy autumn new issue calendar for the Stock Exchange.
In August last year, TLG was the subject of a Pounds 171.5m management
buy-out led by Mr Hamish Bryce, TLG's executive chairman, and backed by
Investcorp, the Bahrain-based international investment bank. Thorn EMI
retained a 12 per cent stake in the business while the management team took
a 3 per cent holding, which could rise to about 13 per cent subject to the
exercise of stock options.
Thorn Lighting's origins go back to 1928 when Sir Jules Thorn founded the
Electric Lamp Services Company in London. The lamp bulb manufacturing
business was finally sold to General Electric in 1991 leaving TLG - renamed
to avoid confusion with its former parent - as a dedicated fittings
manufacturer.
TLG is expected to raise between Pounds 70m and Pounds 80m of new money
through the flotation which will initially be mainly used to reduce TLG's
Pounds 100m net debt. Investcorp and Thorn EMI are expected to retain most
of their shares following the flotation.
The group, headquartered in Spennymoor, County Durham where it also has a
state of the art manufacturing facility, has operations in 23 countries,
including manufacturing facilities in eight, and has more than 4,000
employees world-wide. Among the large projects undertaken by TLG are
lighting the Tower of London and the Sydney Opera House.
It is the market leader for commercial industrial, public and industrial
light fittings in the UK, where it has about a 23 per cent market share, and
the Nordic region and has strong positions in the French and German markets.
It is also a market leader in Australasia and has a strong base in the fast
growing Chinese and south east Asian markets.
Despite the recession, which has affected all the group's main markets
including the Pounds 2.8bn European market, TLG's profitability has grown
rapidly in recent years helped by cost reductions, the introduction of
modern management and production techniques and sharply improved
productivity.
The company's Spennymoor factory, which employs 1,050, has won a raft of
awards and was recently named best factory in the north-east in a
competition run by the Cornfield School of Management and the Department of
Trade of Industry.
Over the past three years, the workforce has been cut by 22 per cent, three
factories have been closed and a 24-hour European distribution hub has been
established in Brussels. As a result, turnover per head has risen by 30 per
cent and profit per head by 135 per cent.
Meanwhile, tight financial management means that working capital has been
reduced while investment in new product development has been stepped up and
product portfolio has been updated. As a result, sales of new products
launched since 1992 are expected to account for about 40 per cent of UK
sales this year.
Overall operating profits have increased by 85 per cent from Pounds 11m in
the year to March 31 1992 to Pounds 20.4m in the latest period (to March 31
1994) on flat turnover of Pounds 324m, reflecting the recession and intense
competition.
As TLG's main markets, including continental Europe, begin to show signs of
recovery, Mr Bryce says the group is poised for strong organic growth which
could in some markets, for example in Germany, be augmented by acquisitions,
though he insists there is nothing planned at present.
At the time of the management buy-out, TLG had been expected to come to
market by about 1996. Mr Bryce, who joined Thorn Lighting in 1986 and has
overseen the transformation of the business, says the accelerated timetable
reflects the success of the group in boosting its financial performance, and
the favourable market conditions.
'We believe now is an appropriate time to obtain a listing of TLG's shares.
The flotation will reduce the group's indebtedness and enhance growth
prospects,' Mr Bryce said.
The issue is sponsored by Kleinwort Benson and the joint stockbrokers to the
issue are Cazenove and Kleinwort Benson Securities.

FT  12 SEP 94 / A test-flight towards prize on the horizon: Method of
Lufthansa issue clears way for Deutsche Telekom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lufthansa, the German national airline, has striven hard over the past two
years to cut costs, shed labour, streamline operations and move out of the
red. It is against this background of a return to profitability that
international investors are being wooed by banks to take up the shares
offered in the airline's DM1bn (Pounds 400m) privatisation issue.
But while the consortium of banks, led by Dresdner of Germany, are confident
that Lufthansa's recovery story is a convincing one - the shares have
doubled over the past year to more than DM200 - the implications of the
issue go well beyond its likely acceptance by investors. They concern future
privatisation issues, German companies' attitudes to new methods of
promoting investor interest and the way in which big German banks are being
forced to relax some of the cosy practices of which foreign banks have often
complained.
By international standards, the Lufthansa issue, with the price to be fixed
on September 29, is relatively small. Thus at first sight, the scale of
international attention focused on the imminent sale of the German
government's shares in the airline may seem overdone. After all, the airline
is already partly privatised - the government's stake is 51.4 per cent with
other state bodies holding a further 5.5 per cent - so investors can readily
buy shares in the market.
Not all investors are persuaded that Lufthansa is as attractive as the banks
say. The shares' sparkling performance has raised worries in some minds of
buying at the top of the market. 'It will require a revision of earnings
estimates to get investors interested,' said Mr John Legat, senior portfolio
manager at GT Management in the UK.
So why has the Bonn government placed so much importance on involving
international investors in this transaction? And why are so many banks (28
in all) keen to participate in promoting and selling the issue? One reason
is that there is a much bigger prize hovering temptingly over the horizon -
the partial privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, the state German
telecommunications concern. The size of this issue could exceed DM10bn.
If the Lufthansa issue is a success, it will bode well for the Telekom
offering which will have to be organised on a much larger scale. For the
first time in a German privatisation, the bookbuilding method is being used.
Investors' bids are collected for the shares, thus helping to establish the
most appropriate selling price. By matching demand and supply in the shares
on offer, bankers hope to avoid excessive volatility when trading starts in
the secondary market.
Through bookbuilding, the banks aim to favour potential long-term investors
over those likely to sell early. It is a transparent method which has
already been used in Germany to varying degrees for issues such as Wella,
the hair care company, Daimler-Benz, the motors and aerospace group,
Dresdner Bank and Buderus, the engineering group. The DM600m sale of 25 per
cent of the shares in Hanover Re, the German reinsurance company, will be
the next German issue in which bookbuilding will be used.
But other German companies - now more comfortable with the idea of having
non-German shareholders - are also intrigued by this method of selecting
high-quality investors, especially for issues with a foreign appeal. 'There
has been a very positive echo from German corporations,' said one Frankfurt
banker involved in the Lufthansa deal. 'German firms used to offer a 20 per
cent discount (when raising capital). If they can get close to the market
price of the shares, they can raise more cash.'
In the share issue carried out abroad by Dresdner Bank this April, which
raised DM1.1bn, bankers estimate bookbuilding meant a near 15 per cent gain
over what would otherwise have been obtained. 'You can separate the wheat
from the chaff,' said one. Because the emphasis is placed on the quality of
the investors and shares are not simply allotted according to a bank's
status or links with the issuing company, issuers clearly benefit.
For the big German banks, this is quite a change. In the past, new share
issues sometimes failed because banks were unable to place the shares they
had been allocated (based on their underwriting quota) in firm hands. This
meant shares were sold in the market, depressing the price after the issue.
Bookbuilding is designed to avoid this; the lead bank funnels shares to
those consortium banks who can call on the best long-term investors.
'The traditional German methods have outlived their time,' said a German
banker. 'German companies have got to be much more capital market-aware and
take account of shareholders' wishes. This is what bookbuilding is all
about.'
But much depends on the way it is carried out. Some bankers are critical of
the 'ring-fencing' approach in which banks - apart from Dresdner and
Deutsche Bank as lead manager and co-lead manager - are restricted to fixed
geographical areas in placing the Lufthansa shares. Other German banks are
irritated at being held to their home base.
'There should be no regional limitations with Deutsche Telekom,' said one
banker. Also, some bankers dislike the fact that no global co-ordinator has
yet been appointed for the Telekom issue, expected in 1996. Now that German
banks are shedding their conservatism and have embraced bookbuilding, they
are keen to see the job done properly.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Company News (This Week): Stores' low-price strategy fails
to satisfy analysts - Kingfisher
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An increase in first-half pre-tax profits tomorrow at Kingfisher, the
retailing group, from Pounds 82m to about Pounds 93m, is not expected to
lift the gloom surrounding the stock in the City.
The shares have fallen from a high of 778p last December to 504p on Friday.
The results will include a full contribution for the first time from Darty,
the French electrical retailer whose acquisition was completed two months
before the end of the first half last year. Stripping out the increase from
Darty, the underlying result is forecast to be down on last year.
Uncertainty among analysts over the size of Darty's trading profit -
forecasts average about Pounds 36m - is one reason for the wide range of
group profits forecasts, from Pounds 89m to Pounds 98m.
There is further uncertainty over how successful Kingfisher, which includes
B&amp;Q, Comet, Superdrug and Woolworths, has been in making its Everyday Low
Pricing Strategy work. Analysts do not quarrel with the overall strategy -
trimming margins to increase sales volumes and market share, allowing
further cuts in prices, to get into a 'productivity loop' - but they are
concerned about its implementation.
They say Kingfisher should have cut costs, and introduced technology such as
electronic point of sale systems in all chains first.
Kingfisher also operates in difficult markets. In the low-growth DIY market,
B&amp;Q is expected to increase trading profits slightly from Pounds 41.6m to
about Pounds 43m. In the similarly depressed electrical market, Comet is
expected to make a small loss after Pounds 700,000 profit last year.
Woolworths has suffered from the downturn in the computer games market, and
is not expected to match last year's Pounds 2.1m profit. Little change is
expected from Superdrug's Pounds 12.8m profit reported last year.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Company News (This Week): Buy-out teams could push bids past
Dollars 1bn - Western Union
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The final round of bidding in the auction of Western Union this Friday could
well elicit an offer of more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) for the world's
biggest non-bank money-transfer company - more than twice the first bid made
in June.
Three bidders remain in the ring: First Financial Management, a data
processing company, First Data, a credit card processing company, and
Forstmann Little, a leveraged buy-out firm.
Western Union, which handled 18.5m payment transactions last year, was put
up for auction by a US bankruptcy judge in June. The company, though not
itself in bankruptcy, is owned by New Valley, which has been operating under
Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code since March.
First Financial, which was the last of the bidders to declare an interest in
Western Union, appears to have made the most attractive offer so far. In the
first round of formal bidding, which closed 10 days ago, the data processing
company offered to pay Dollars 800m.
This compares with Dollars 970m from Forstmann Little - though unlike First
Financial, it has said it will not assume the company's unfunded pension
liability, put at Dollars 265m. First Data, seems to have dropped out of
contention by refusing to raise its earlier offer of Dollars 660m (plus
assumption of the pension liability).

FT  12 SEP 94 / Savoy may deny Forte full victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Savoy hotel group is expected to emerge from its board meeting tomorrow
as an independent company. Plans to merge Savoy's hotels with Forte's luxury
establishments are likely to be shelved for the time being.
The board hopes instead to appoint a new chairman and managing director, who
will be charged with improving Savoy's profits as a stand-alone company.
This outcome will not give Forte the complete victory it has sought. Mr
Rocco Forte, the group's chairman, had previously said he wanted a majority
stake in a company which combined the Savoy group with Forte's top hotels.
Forte is, however, expected to be given greater participation in the
management of Savoy.
Savoy die-hards still hope that a white knight might offer to buy the stakes
of one or more small Savoy shareholding trusts, thereby pushing Forte even
further away from outright control.
Their interest has been raised by a planned meeting today between Sir
Anthony Tuke, Savoy's chairman, and Mr Jay Pritzker, the Chicago financier
whose family owns the Hyatt hotels group. Mr Pritzker was unavailable for
comment.
Savoy directors hope to announce on Tuesday that Mr Ramon Pajares, general
manager of London's Four Seasons hotel, will replace Mr Giles Shepard, the
Savoy managing director, who is expected to resign today or tomorrow.
Sir Ewen Fergusson, chairman of Coutts, the private bank, and former British
ambassador to France and South Africa, is the leading candidate to succeed
Sir Anthony, who wishes to retire.
The directors' endorsement of Sir Ewen and Mr Pajares would represent a
truce in the 13-year-old feud between Savoy loyalists and Forte. A takeover
battle which lasted for much of the 1980s resulted in Forte owning 68 per
cent of the shares but only 42 per cent of the vote.
Forte has for several months been talking to shareholding trusts controlled
by the family of the late Sir Hugh Wontner, Savoy president until his death
in 1992. There has been speculation that the trusts might be prepared to
align themselves with the Forte camp.
Instead, there has been a recognition by both sides that the Savoy hotels -
which include the Savoy, Claridge's and the Connaught - have performed
poorly under Mr Shepard. Last year, the group made pre-tax profits of only
Pounds 725,000 on turnover of Pounds 83.3m.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Bolivian stock set for listing in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Bolivian electricity distributor will become the first Latin American
company for decades to trade its shares on the London stock exchange if
plans to list the group go ahead in November.
The Cochabamba Light and Power Company could even be the first listing since
the Antofagasta Chile and Bolivian Railway was registered, towards the end
of the last century, according to Mr Peter Earl, a consultant with
Fieldstone Private Capital Group.
Fieldstone, an investment bank, is planning Cochabamba's listings in La Paz
and London, as well as an 'offer for sale', with the overall exercise part
of the recent restructuring of the country's electricity industry. It values
the company at about Dollars 33m (Pounds 21m), and is giving priority to
Bolivian investors, saying the London listing will be secondary. It is
hoping that international investors will buy at least some of the 70 per
cent stake, being sold by the Bolivian nationalised energy company.
'Until now, there has been no possibility of buying Bolivian stocks so there
is considerable pent-up demand with large sums already deposited for this
purpose in New York and London,' said Mr Earl.
'There has been considerable interest expressed by overseas investors
particularly those from overseas markets,' he added.
Earlier this year investor confidence in Latin America was dented by turmoil
on international markets and signs of political instability, especially in
Mexico.
Although issuance is expected to fall from last year's record of Dollars
6bn, Latin American companies raised more than Dollars 3bn in international
equity offerings in the first seven months of the year, according to
International Financing Review, a specialist publication.
Mr Earl says that the recent restructuring of the Bolivian electricity
industry has followed the UK model. Describing the company as a 'Latin
American Manweb', he says its operating profits rose 62 per cent and
revenues 21 per cent in 1993.
The Caracas-based Andean Development Corporation, a regional development
body, is underwriting the issue alongside Fieldstone.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Balladur plans review of white-collar crime probes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, has begun a review of the
legal process for investigating white-collar crime following the recent wave
of probes into prominent industrialists.
The premier, speaking on television yesterday, said the recent spate of
highly-publicised investigations had been 'no good for democracy, for the
economy or for the companies themselves'. He did not envisage launching an
Italian-style 'clean hands' operation but said he was anxious to ensure that
the legal system was working efficiently.
Last week, a French magistrate opened an investigation into Mr Jean-Louis
Beffa, chairman of the Saint-Gobain glass group, as part of a probe into
alleged illicit political funding, and a Brussels judge issued an
international warrant for the arrest of Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne,
chairman of the Schneider electrical engineering company.
At least another 100 heads of businesses are currently under investigation.
A poll published last week in Le Monde found that two-thirds of company
chairmen believed corruption was rife in the corporate sector. Mr Balladur
said last night that he believed 'none should be above the law'.
However, the government is understood to be concerned about the impact of
the investigations into confidence in the companies and their share prices.
Mr Francois Ceyrac, former chairman of the Patronnat, the employer's
association, and Mr Andre Bergeron, former director of the Force Ouvriere
trade union, will conduct the review.
The prime minister also announced that he plans next month to launch a new
series of initiatives to help young people following the completion of a
government survey of French youth triggered by this winter's youth riots. He
said he was also considering proposals to tackle long-term unemployment.
These initiatives come at a time when Mr Balladur is gaining ground in the
opinion polls in the run-up to next spring's presidential elections. He
topped a poll in yesterday's Journal du Dimanche as the most popular
presidential choice with 19 per cent of the votes, ahead of Mr Jacques
Delors, the leading left-wing contender, with 17 per cent. Mr Jacques
Chirac, the prime minister's rival for the centre-right ticket, scored 13
per cent.
Mr Balladur's popularity has been boosted by the withdrawal from public life
of Mr Francois Mitterrand, the socialist president, following prostate
surgery earlier this summer. The prime minister has since been able to adopt
a presidential role, notably in foreign affairs.
However, Mr Mitterrand last week criticised Mr Balladur for trying to usurp
him. The president, dogged by controversy over a book revealing his youthful
links with Nazi collaborators, is this evening expected to try to reassert
his authority when interviewed on television.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Big Mac serves up measure of global earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
McDonald's Big Mac hamburger has been chosen by Union Bank of Switzerland as
an international measure of purchasing power.
The UBS researchers, compiling a survey of international prices and wages
called Prices and Earnings around the Globe, say the best way to illustrate
what wages will buy is to relate them to prices of individual products. The
best measures, they find, are a 1kg loaf of bread and a Big Mac.
According to UBS, the worst place to be if you are penniless and in need of
a hamburger is Lagos, the Nigerian capital. There it will take you more than
11 hours of toil, almost two full working days, to earn enough to buy a Big
Mac. That compares with 14 minutes in Chicago.
International price comparisons and cost-of-living indicators are becoming
increasingly valuable to executives negotiating pay packages for overseas
postings. The UBS survey uses a uniform basket of goods so that clear
comparisons can be made.
The survey shows that while the top earnings are in Switzerland, the most
expensive flats are in Hong Kong and the dearest clothes in Tokyo.
North America also has the least expensive motoring, while those using
public transport in Europe can expect to pay through the nose.
Among the smaller items, a shampoo and set at a women's hairdresser costs
between Dollars 40 and Dollars 65 (Pounds 42) in Oslo. The best places for a
cheap hairdo - less than Dollars 7 - are Taipei, Caracas, Budapest, Nairobi,
Prague and Bombay.
The biggest gross earners are the Swiss, the Danes and the Japanese,
followed by the Germans, Luxembourg and the US. London is midway in the
earnings league behind Milan and Paris, with Nairobi, Lagos and Bombay at
the foot of the table. Luxembourg incomes, however, enjoy the most
purchasing power, followed by those in Toronto, Montreal and Dusseldorf.
People in the Far East tend to work the longest hours, while the fewest
hours are worked by those in Madrid.
Of the 53 cities in the comparison, Tokyo is the most expensive, with Lagos,
surprisingly, in second place, followed by Oslo and Zurich.
If you are thinking about a romantic weekend away, the cost of spending a
night for two in a double room with a bathroom in a first-class hotel ranges
from Dollars 112 in Nairobi to Dollars 382 in Tokyo.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Cabinet sets up inquiry into public sector building costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government will this week announce a wide-ranging inquiry into
construction ordering by government departments and agencies after a series
of Whitehall building scandals.
Civil servants in the Cabinet Office efficiency unit will investigate recent
large public-sector building projects that have either cost much more than
planned or been very late.
They include the Pounds 450m British Library building at St Pancras in north
London, where the first phase has cost more than double the original
estimate and is still incomplete after 16 years.
Other public-sector projects costing much more than originally planned
include the Trident nuclear submarine base at Faslane in Scotland, where
overruns in construction costs accounted for much of the 72 per cent
overspend on the 10-year project.
The inquiry will be supervised by Sir Peter Levene, the prime minister's
efficiency adviser, who completed a similar study in July on the
government's use of external consultants. That study recommended changes
expected to save Pounds 130m over three years.
Sir Peter is chairman and chief executive of Canary Wharf, the London
Docklands property development. In spite of subsequent difficulties in
finding tenants, the construction phase of Canary Wharf was finished on time
and within budget. 'If this can be achieved for one of the largest civil
engineering projects in the country, I want to know why it cannot be done
for large public-sector projects.' he said.
As head of defence procurement in the 1980s, he shook up the Ministry of
Defence's equipment purchasing policies, sweeping away practices such as
cost-plus contracts and cosy relationships with contractors.
Sir Peter believes that better government ordering practices forced the UK
defence industry to become more competitive, helping it to win exports. He
hopes that improvements in procurement practices will also improve the
construction industry's competitiveness abroad.
The construction inquiry follows publication in July of the Latham review
into contract and management practices in the construction industry. The
review recommended radical changes to cut costs.
Public-sector work - excluding housing but including infrastructure
construction - accounted for about a third of the industry's Pounds 46bn
annual turnover in 1993.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Main parties share honours in German state elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Christian Democratic Union and their Social Democrat rivals yesterday
won decisive victories in two regional elections in Germany, which have been
see as an early test of the parties' standing before the federal elections
next month.
The CDU prime minister of the eastern German state of Saxony, Mr Kurt
Biedenkopf, and the Social Democratic prime minister of Brandenburg, Mr
Manfred Stolpe, were returned to power with absolute majorities, according
to exit polls, conducted by ARD state television and by later computer
predictions.
The Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), the successor to the former east
German communist party also increased its share of the vote, becoming the
third largest party in both states.
Yet the Free Democrats, the junior partner in Chancellor Kohl's governing
CDU coalition, and the Bundnis 90/Green party failed to get the 5 per cent
minimum required to enter either of the two parliaments.
The interpretation of the vote was complicated by turn outs of less than
half eligible voters.
In Saxony, the only state where the CDU has an absolute majority, Mr
Biedenkopf, a former former general secretary of the CDU, was returned with
57.7 per cent of the vote, three points higher than in 1990.
Mr Biedenkopf said in a television interview: 'I am very happy. But I want
to use my second term in office to speak on behalf of all Saxons.'
The SPD failed to make inroads in Saxony, winning only 17 per cent of the
vote, 2 points less than in 1990. The FDP's share of the vote was cut from
6.6 per cent to 1.8 per cent and the Bundnis 90/Greens's vote fell from 5.6
per cent to 4.3 per cent, leaving both parties outside parliament. The PDS
vote rose from 10.2 per cent in 1990 to more than 16 per cent.
In Brandenburg, the only eastern German state with an SPD-led coalition
government, the party's share of the vote rose from 38.2 per cent in 1990 to
53.5 per cent. But the strong showing may reflect the special factors at
play in eastern German politics rather than national trends.
The CDU's share of the vote collapsed from 29.4 per cent in 1990 to less
than 20 per cent. The FDP vote fell from 6.6 per cent to 2.3 per cent, and
the Bundnis 90/Greens vote also dropped from 9.3 per cent to under 2.9 per
cent. By contrast, the PDS share of the vote rose from 13.4 per cent to 18.9
per cent.

FT  12 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Mobile satellites
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A game of chicken is being played out in the so far non-existent market for
pocket satellite phones. Inmarsat's decision to raise Dollars 1bn (Pounds
600m) in equity for its mobile satellite affiliate has sharply increased the
game's stakes. The industrial might now converging on the market is
formidable. Inmarsat itself is owned by 75 telecom operators. Three rival
consortia include corporate giants such as Motorola, Lockheed, Sony, Loral,
Alcatel-Alsthom, Vodafone and France Telecom as well as Mr Bill Gates and Mr
Craig McCaw, America's best-known high-technology entrepreneurs.
Pocket satellite phones will be a niche market, providing services for
globe-trotting business people and those parts of the world without ordinary
cellular networks. That could still be a lucrative market. But it is
doubtful that four groups investing Dollars 10bn-20bn in total can all be
profitable. Some will back down or merge. The first test will be whether
they are prepared to put in hard cash.
Motorola's Iridium has already raised Dollars 800m, though some of this
involves commitments to provide services rather than cash. Loral's
Globalstar has pulled in a more modest Dollars 275m. Inmarsat's Dollars 1bn
financing is the most ambitious. But perhaps it has the easiest task, in
that it is raising the money from a closed group of mainly state-owned
monopolies. Inmarsat's plans will only look commercial to outsiders if its
few private-sector investors such as BT think the project worth bankrolling.

FT  12 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Agrochemicals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The dust has at last settled on the European agrochemicals industry,
following 1992's Common Agricultural Policy reforms. These scythed up to 20
per cent off the European market. Results from agrochemicals companies
during the first six months indicate the market should stabilise this year,
but the outlook for European agrochemicals groups remains bleak. This year,
everything that could go right for the industry has done so, yet the world
agrochemicals market is forecast to expand by only 3 per cent. Over the next
five years, annual growth is expected to be limited to no more than 2 per
cent.
Such poor prospects would not be so serious if European agrochemicals groups
were capable of generating reasonable returns. Even before the reforms, they
were poor. In 1991 Bayer achieved margins of 8.9 per cent. In spite of the
recovery this year, profitability remains lamentable. Zeneca's margins
during the first half crept up from 10.1 per cent to 13.7 per cent. It is
not that the business is intrinsically unprofitable. US groups such as
Uniroyal and Monsanto have achieved margins as high as 33 per cent.
The European industry must follow the example of the American industry, by
cutting costs, rationalising or taking the difficult decision to leave the
business altogether. Unlike the US, where just four large manufacturers
remain, in Europe only Schering and Hoechst have merged, leaving Ciba,
Sandoz, Rhone-Poulenc, Zeneca, Bayer and BASF battling for market share. The
present situation is unsustainable, and benefits neither companies nor their
shareholders.

FT  12 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: European M&amp;A
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
European mergers and acquisition specialists must be green with envy as they
contemplate the bumper year being enjoyed by their US counterparts. Though
the level of European M&amp;A activity has picked up, it does not compare with
the flow of multi-billion dollar deals on the other side of the Atlantic.
There three sectors in particular are being convulsed by restructuring:
pharmaceuticals, defence and media/telecoms.
On the surface, conditions look ripe for a similar burst of activity in
Europe. Like the Clinton administration, European governments are trying to
keep the lid on healthcare bills and cut defence spending. So it makes sense
for drugs and defence groups to merge and reduce capacity. The technological
forces reshaping the boundaries between telecoms and media sectors are also
a worldwide phenomenon. Indeed, Europe has seen some activity in all these
sectors. The UK's independent television system has been consolidated.
Tentative steps are being taken to rationalise the European defence
industry. And European pharmaceutical groups have been prominent in buying
US drugs companies, though few have themselves been targets.
But European M&amp;A activity lags US deal-making for two main reasons. First,
political sensitivities make cross-border restructuring hard in industries
such as defence and telecoms. Second, with European recovery still sluggish,
many managers are reluctant to splash out on big deals. Memories of
recession will undoubtedly fade and M&amp;A activity pick up. But bumper
conditions are unlikely to return for some time.

FT  12 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Launching Lufthansa
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A great deal is riding on the Lufthansa share sale, which kicks off with the
pricing of its rights issue today. This is not because the issue is
particularly large. Investors will be offered about DM1bn (Pounds 400m) in
stock as a result of the government not taking up its rights. The importance
is rather that Lufthansa is seen as a trial run for the much larger Deutsche
Telekom float scheduled for 1996. The Lufthansa issue will be the first time
the German government has sold stock through a book building process. As
such, it gives investment banks the chance to prove their technical prowess
and so position themselves for the multi-million dollar fees anticipated
from the Telekom float.
The enthusiasm of the banks, of course, carries dangers for investors. There
is such a large cast of banks involved that shareholders will be
hard-pressed to find an independent voice to advise them on valuation.
Bankers wishing to curry favour with Bonn cannot be expected to put out sell
notes in advance of the offer. So there is a risk that the stock price could
become inflated during the book building period.
But if the shares continue to retreat from their mid-summer peak, Lufthansa
will start to look attractive again. Over the past two years, the airline
has made a break with its public-sector past. Cost-cutting and the recovery
in aviation traffic are turning losses into profits. Lufthansa is still less
efficient than British Airways and KLM. But it looks well-placed to compete
in Europe's increasingly deregulated aviation market.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Observer: Graces score
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A reader has an alternative theory, though, as to why John Paul Getty II
should have rushed so willingly to the damsels' side.
Was the anglophile cricketing enthusiast, who promised to fork out Pounds 1m
to keep the work in the UK, fondly reminded of that other troika of Graces,
William Gilbert, and his brothers, Edward Mills and George Frederick?
While the exploits of WG, the 19th century's greatest cricketer, are well
known, his elder brother Edward preceded him as England's best batsman.
Moreover, in 1880, all three Graces assembled at The Oval to face Australia
in what was the first test played in England.
Sadly, there is no evidence that the family possessed any special literary
or artistic bent. WG was well ahead of his time in employing the services of
a ghost writer to help compile his history of the sport.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Scores of readers have been impressing Observer with their erudition in
response to the challenge of naming the Three Graces - Aglaia, Euphrosyne
and Thalia.
The latter is also the Muse of comedy, so she at least should derive some
amusement from the shenanigans connected with the Canova piece.
His request for the Pounds 64 garden version of the statue notwithstanding,
Jeff Wagland of High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, who was drawn as the winner,
receives instead a small libation.

Ever wondered what happened to all those sociolinguists that academic
establishments seemed to be cloning by the dozen during the 1970s? Well,
some have found gainful employment.
It was to Semiotic Solutions, for instance, that British Telecom turned for
some help during its campaign to persuade the male of the species to dally
longer on the telephone.
Now the self-same experts in the meaning of signs and symbols have been
asked to judge how Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald's will go down in
India.
McDonald's, the boffins concluded, will be the 'friendly alien tapping into
the outer directed culture and self, appealing to the emergent younger
generation cohorts, and being a badge or marker of lifestyle'.
Kentucky Fried Chicken, a trifle more prosaically, will 'penetrate the home
and family with new, more efficient ways of doing traditional things'.
Which apparently translates into the prediction that chicken nuggets will
outsell cheeseburgers on the streets of Bombay.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Observer: Hard pawn
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pawnbroking thrives in the Niggardly Nineties, it would seem. So officials
from the world's largest chain of pawnbrokers Cash America Investments,
which is quoted on the New York Stock Exchange (code PWN), swung in to
Sweden recently to exploit the devastation caused by the country's banking
crisis two years ago.
The financiers, who hail from Fort Worth, Texas, and who in 1992 scooped up
Britain's Harvey &amp; Thompson, found a whole new class of Swedes deeply
distrustful of the banks after recent calamities. Before you could sing Pop
goes the Weasel, they were offering Dollars 21m for Svensk Pantbelaning, the
country's premier chain of 10 shops. The purchase takes the global empire to
326 outlets.
Olle Fjordgren, chief executive of the 109-year-old Swedish business,
reckons pawnshops now command 2 per cent of total lending to private
individuals in his country. He claims to have squeezed a 55 per cent share
of a market worth SKr550m and growing at 12 per cent per annum.
To prove that those in hock no longer feel the need to frequent dingy
back-street premises, Fjordgren's outfit, which draws the line at pawning
fine art, now has a shop on Birger Jarlsgatan, one of Stockholm's snazziest
streets in the heart of the financial district.

<TEXT>
If a sense of being ill-treated in their former incarnations is a recipe for
success, Pehr 'PG' Gyllenhammar and Hans-Jorg Rudloff should make a real go
of their delightfully audacious ambitions to help build a new investment
bank.
Rudloff, an old friend of PG's, who sat with him on the advisory board of
the EBRD, must be rather tempted to show up his former masters at Credit
Suisse. Eighteen months ago they invited the Euromarkets supremo on to the
board in Zurich to concentrate on 'strategy', a position which Rudloff quit
in February.
Meanwhile Gyllenhammar, undeterred by the raspberry with which his fellow
Swedes greeted his scheme to merge Volvo with Renault, is confidently
stressing the international credentials of the outfit which he is to chair.
With the likes of Francois-Xavier Ortoli, a former French finance minister
and EU commission president, and Lord Carrington, the former British foreign
secretary, it will doubtless prove an interesting cross-cultural exercise.
The European Merchant Bank, or however the London West End creature is
eventually styled, is contemplating a market that is far from saturated. It
will of course attract the envy of erstwhile colleagues strung up in the
bureaucracy of established investment banks.
So if Rudloff can be as tough with his cronies as he was with his CSFB
staff, he and PG could just be back on the road.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Terms still to be decided: The issues that will determine
whether the nuclear non-proliferation treaty is extended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While delegates in Cairo wrangle over ways to deal with the world population
explosion, another international conference, no less crucial to the future
of the planet, is being prepared in Geneva: on extending the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty.
The success or failure of such conferences depends in large measure on work
done beforehand. Today's meeting of the preparatory committee for the NPT
conference should begin to 'discuss seriously the agenda and content',
according to a report just published by a group of specialised arms control
think-tanks*. This means the bargaining positions of the main parties,
nuclear and non-nuclear, should for the first time be clearly staked out.
The conference, to be held in New York next spring, is prescribed by the NPT
itself: it has to decide whether the treaty should 'continue in force
indefinitely, or shall be extended for an additional fixed period or
periods'. The treaty, signed in 1968, divides the world into nuclear-weapon
and non-nuclear-weapon states, the former being those which had exploded a
nuclear device before 1967. By that definition there were five
nuclear-weapon states - the US, Soviet Union, UK, France and China - and the
NPT aim was to freeze them at that number. Many non-nuclear states would
have liked to abolish nuclear weapons altogether, but had to content
themselves with a pledge to 'pursue negotiations in good faith on effective
measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and
to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament
under strict and effective international control'.
One thing the signatories could not agree on was how long the treaty should
remain in force. The nuclear powers wanted an indefinite treaty, while some
of the non-nuclear wanted to keep a nuclear option open for themselves in
case the treaty failed. So they left the matter to be decided at next year's
conference, held when the treaty will have been in force for 25 years.
The decision on extending the treaty must be taken by a majority of the
parties, which on the latest count means at least 83 states. Most
governments would prefer a decision taken by consensus, which would carry
greater political weight. But few would want the treaty to lapse just
because one or two states (such as Iraq or North Korea) refused to go along.
So western governments are keeping open the option of a vote, to ensure that
the conference reaches a decision.
Many governments, including four of the five official nuclear powers, Nato,
Japan and nearly all European states, favour indefinite, unconditional
extension. China is thought to favour indefinite extension on certain
conditions. Only Iran, so far, has come out clearly against an indefinite
extension; but it is not alone among third-world states in thinking that
extension for fixed periods would keep the nuclear powers under greater
pressure to move towards disarmament. How exactly this would work is not
clear, but it could mean the present exercise being repeated at regular
intervals, perhaps every 25 years.
Amendment of the treaty, everyone agrees, would be impossible, because the
procedure is too complex. Nor is there any chance of it being scrapped and
replaced by a new treaty - for instance, one with tougher and more binding
obligations on the nuclear powers - before next spring, or any time soon.
The existing treaty now has 164 signatories. No new one could quickly gain
anything like such wide support.
Many non-specialists believe that the NPT has failed, or was useful only in
cold war conditions; that proliferation in the real world is rampant; and
that extending the treaty amounts to little more than 'shutting the stable
after the horse has bolted'. But such views are not shared by experts such
as John Simpson, head of the non-proliferation programme at Southampton
University. He points out that the world of 20 or more nuclear powers which
seemed imminent in the 1960s is still far off; and that in several respects
the situation has lately improved.
Until 1990, he says, six countries which had not signed the NPT were
'threshold' or 'suspect' states, assumed either to have a nuclear weapon or
to be actively developing one. That list has now shrunk to three: South
Africa has scrapped its nuclear programme and joined the NPT as a
non-nuclear weapon state; while Argentina and Brazil have signed bilateral
non-proliferation agreements and joined the regional Tlatelolco treaty,
which makes all Latin America and the Caribbean a nuclear weapon-free zone.
And Algeria, potentially a seventh 'suspect', has promised to join the NPT
and accepted a safeguard agreement for its nuclear reactor.
That leaves India, Pakistan and Israel. The India-Pakistan relationship
remains tense, and this may be the region where the danger of nuclear war is
greatest. But from a proliferation point of view the two states form a
stable sub-system, with no other state in the region aspiring to emulate
them. Israel's de facto nuclear status is more dangerous to the NPT regime,
because of the asymmetry between it and the Arab states. Many Arabs cite
this as a reason for not ratifying the convention banning chemical weapons;
and they may refuse to support NPT extension unless the US presses Israel to
denuclearise.
Meanwhile the dissolution of the Soviet Union has confronted the NPT with a
new problem: the division of one nuclear-weapon state into several, all of
which could have claimed to inherit that status. An international consensus
was swiftly reached that only Russia should be allowed to do so.
All tactical nuclear weapons have been transferred to Russia from other
ex-Soviet republics, as have strategic weapons from Belarus and Kazakhstan,
which have joined the NPT as non-nuclear weapon states. Ukraine has agreed
in principle to do the same, but has not yet done so. For the time being,
strategic weapons remain on its territory, but they are being shipped out
and, in any case, Ukraine could not target or fire them without Russian
co-operation. Ukraine has also agreed to an audit of all nuclear materials
on its territory by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the body
charged under the treaty with verifying non-nuclear states' compliance.
Proliferation within the former Soviet Union is now overshadowed by anxiety
over the smuggling of plutonium and other nuclear materials from there to
would-be proliferators elsewhere, as exposed by the recent interception of
Russian plutonium shipments in Germany.
Meanwhile, France and China - the two acknowledged nuclear powers which
rejected the NPT in the 1960s - have acceded to it. Even Israel, India and
Pakistan, which have not signed, pay the treaty a back-handed compliment by
not declaring themselves nuclear powers (though last month Nawaz Sharif,
former prime minister of Pakistan, embarrassed his successor by stating
publicly that Pakistan does have a nuclear weapon). The NPT has made
non-proliferation a universally respected norm.
But is it respected in word only? The scope of Iraq's weapons programme,
revealed after the Gulf war in 1991, shook many people's confidence. Iraq
was the first of a new category of NPT 'renegades': a long-standing
signatory of the treaty, it had allowed the IAEA to monitor its use of
imported nuclear fuel. Yet neither the IAEA nor any national intelligence
service detected its clandestine weapons programme. This discovery prompted
nuclear suppliers to tighten their export restrictions, and to insist on
much more intrusive IAEA inspections - though so far they have not endowed
the IAEA with resources to match.
The IAEA can monitor compliance, but only the UN Security Council, on whose
order Iraq has now been disarmed, has the power and authority to enforce
compliance: a distinction highlighted by the next 'renegade', North Korea.
Here the IAEA did its job well, in that North Korea could only conceal what
it was doing by refusing co-operation with IAEA inspectors. But the UN's
ability or willingness to do anything about it is more doubtful.
Perhaps the fear of UN sanctions helped change the late Kim Il-sung's
attitude in June, when he suddenly agreed to 'freeze' nuclear activity
during new high-level talks with US officials. But it is not yet clear how
far this presages a real change in North Korean behaviour. And it is far
from clear that sanctions would have worked, or even have been applied.
China, which is North Korea's main trading partner, might well have vetoed,
or simply ignored, them.
Iraq was disarmed after military defeat. Theoretically, military action
could be taken against North Korea, but it would be extremely risky.
Probably, if North Korea remained recalcitrant, the world would have to
settle for isolating it as far as possible, while trying to block any
further proliferation from it to other potential renegades, such as Iran.
Iran's case further illustrates the difficulty of seeking to prevent
proliferation purely by restricting supply. Iran fulfils all its NPT
obligations and yet, because nuclear suppliers are suspicious of its
intentions, does not get the free access to peaceful nuclear energy it is
entitled to under the treaty. This strengthens many third-world states'
belief that the nuclear powers have not fulfilled their side of the bargain.
Most non-nuclear states did not sign the treaty as a favour to the nuclear
powers, but to enhance their own security. The treaty's main function is to
reduce demand for nuclear weapons, by relieving each non-nuclear state of
the fear that its potential adversaries will get them first. But this will
not stave off proliferation indefinitely, unless nuclear powers do more to
improve the security of non-nuclear ones - or so at least the latter argue.
There are three kinds of thing they can do:
'Positive assurances': pledges to come to the aid of non-nuclear states if
nuclear weapons are used or threatened against them. In 1968 the UK, US and
Soviet Union gave such a pledge in a United Nations Security Council
resolution. But such broad pledges are not very credible. 'Negative security
assurances': promises that they themselves will not use or threaten nuclear
weapons against non-nuclear states. These were only available in heavily
qualified form during the cold war, because both sides reserved the right to
use nuclear weapons in certain circumstances against each other's allies.
But they may now be willing to go further. Last week Iran and 10 other
states tabled a proposal for a protocol on security assurances to be added
to the NPT.
Progress towards general nuclear disarmament, as promised in the treaty.
Many non-nuclear states have decided to judge the nuclear powers' good faith
by their willingness to negotiate a worldwide ban on nuclear tests.
The last conference to review implementation of the NPT, in 1990, broke up
without agreement because the US and UK refused to commit themselves to such
a ban. Since then, there has been spectacular progress towards disarmament
in the form of reductions in the US and Russian nuclear arsenals; France and
China have adhered to the NPT; and the Clinton administration, followed by a
reluctant UK, has come out for a comprehensive test ban. Negotiations on
this began in January, but progress has been slow, mainly because the UK,
France and China are dragging their feet. A draft text was agreed last week,
two months later than most delegates had hoped, and further talks are to be
held at the end of the year. But the prospect of agreeing a test ban treaty
by next April, when the NPT conference meets, is now thought remote.
The nuclear powers, especially the western ones, are still prone to assume
that the NPT's benefits are self-evident. They have perhaps not taken the
full measure of third-world states' impatience with the post-cold war world
order, and the need to convince them that general disarmament is a genuine,
if still a distant, goal.
