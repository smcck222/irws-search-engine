A little-known German bank is thought to be behind the mysterious
counter-bid for Banca Nazionale delle Communicazioni (BNC), the Italian bank
being courted by Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino.
Italian news agencies said the Bank fur Vermogensnlagen und Handel (BVH),
based in Dusseldorf, had confirmed it had tabled an offer for a stake in
BNC, which is controlled by the Italian railway.
Mr Publio Fiori, the Italian transport minister, has claimed over the past
few weeks that a counter-bid for BNC was imminent. He is trying to pressure
San Paolo di Torino, Italy's biggest bank, into amending its preliminary
all-share bid for BNC, to safeguard the interests of the state railways.
BVH and Mr Fiori's office - which is reported to have received the BVH offer
on Wednesday night - were silent yesterday on details of any alternative
bid. San Paolo, the only group to have declared a formal interest, still
seems the favourite to acquire BNC.
Mr Fiori's intervention has irritated the Italian Treasury and the Bank of
Italy. Last month he accused the central bank, responsible for vetting bank
takeovers, of trying to force BNC into the San Paolo fold.

FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: National Semi flat at Dollars
59m for quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Semiconductor, the US chip maker, reported flat first
quarter-results, in spite of growth in sales of its core analog and mixed
signal products.
Net income of Dollars 59m, or 42 cents a share, compared with Dollars 52.2m,
or 37 cents, before an accounting change in the same period last year. Sales
declined to Dollars 553.8m from Dollars 558.9m.
In the first fiscal quarter last year, National reported an additional
one-time gain of Dollars 4.9m, or 4 cents a share, due to a change in
inventory accounting.
'Although overall results for the quarter were essentially flat with the
previous year, we continued to show good performance in our core analog and
mixed signal businesses which now represent more than half of our total
sales and are the focus for our future growth,' said Mr Gilbert Amelio,
president and chief executive.
Analog and mixed signal chips (which incorporate both digital and analog
circuits) are widely used in consumer electronics, automotive,
telecommunications and computer applications.
Mr Amelio said first-quarter results reflected a summer slowdown in orders,
amplified by lower demand for products such as bipolar logic, used in
desktop computers and large computer systems.
Sales of bipolar logic declined to 8 per cent of total sales, compared with
13 per cent for the first quarter of the previous fiscal year.

FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: Investors oust five directors at
Cadillac Fairview

<TEXT>
A group of institutional investors who recently emerged as the biggest
shareholders and creditors of Cadillac Fairview have ousted more than half
the directors of the financially stretched North American property
developer.
Cadillac yesterday named Mr Charles Masson, former head of financial
restructurings at Salomon Brothers, the New York based investment bank, as
chairman. Five of the previous nine-member board have been replaced by seven
new directors.
Cadillac, whose 70 properties include several of Canada's biggest downtown
office buildings and shopping malls, has been hit by the long downturn in
North American real estate markets. The Toronto-based company is in the
throes of restructuring CDollars 2.2bn (USDollars 1.6bn) of debt on its
properties as well as CDollars 1bn of syndicated bank debt. It is
negotiating a capital infusion from one or more outside investors.
Cadillac, a private company, said about 75 per cent of its common shares and
90 per cent of its senior debt had recently changed hands.
The biggest single shareholder is Calpers, the California public sector
pension fund, with a 15 per cent stake.
The new owners and creditors are an assortment of institutions, including
pension funds and so-called vulture funds.
Mr Masson said the new owners 'were of the view that it would be in their
best interests to place people on the board who were known to them'.
Mr Graham Eadie, Cadillac's chief executive, said the new owners 'recognise
there's good value and good upside here'.
Mr Masson said he hoped the board changes would not slow the restructuring
process. He indicated that he hoped to complete the restructuring in about
nine months, although he said such negotiations usually took longer than
expected.

He also revealed that Cassa di Risparmio in Bologna, another Italian bank,
had proposed an alternative cash offer for a majority stake in BNC. That bid
was rejected by the Bank of Italy.
The San Paolo offer was first announced in March, before Mr Fiori became
transport minister, and the two banks had hoped to wrap up the deal quickly.
The merger must be completed by the end of this year to take advantage of
tax-breaks offered under 1990 banking legislation.

FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: Australian gas venture for MIM

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conoco Australia, part of the Houston-based Conoco energy group, is to
partner Australia's MIM Holdings in the potential development of a coalbed
methane gas project in central Queensland, writes Nikki Tait.
The Conoco subsidiary will fund a ADollars 22m (USDollars 16.1m)
exploration, research and trial production programme over the next two to
three years, receiving a 50 per cent stake in the project in return.
Coalbed methane gas accounts for a growing proportion of natural gas
production in the US, and Conoco has experience as a large-scale producer in
New Mexico and Virginia.
In this case, any natural gas production would be used either for power
generation or as a feedstock.
Niugini Mining, the Papua New Guinea-based group which is controlled by
Canada's Battle Mountain and which is a partner with RTZ of the UK in the
controversial Lihir project, reported a 57 per cent fall in profits in the
six months to end-June at 724,000 kina (USDollars 787,042).
The decline was largely due to decreased gold production from the Red Dome
mine in Queensland, as the company concentrated on treating low-grade
stockpiled ore while the pit was deepened to allow access to higher-grade
reserves.

FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: Japanese groups join video
conferencing standard
</HEADLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's largest telecommunications and computer companies plan to launch
products and services for desktop video conferencing based on standards
established by Intel and other US companies.
NTT, NEC, Fujitsu and Just Systems have joined a group of US companies that
endorses the Personal Conferencing Specification. In joining the group the
companies have signaled their intention to introduce PCS compatible
products.
PCS is a standard that defines protocols permitting inter-operable, PC-based
conferencing and communications. PCS compatible products such as Intel's
Proshare allow PC users to see each other as they talk and share data and
computer applications.
'This announcement is very good news to PC users all over the world,' said
Mr Andrew Grove, Intel president and chief executive. 'Having leading
companies in the Japanese PC and telecommunications industries join this
activity is a key step in making PC-based conferencing a worldwide
application. NTT's role as a leading network service provider in integrating
PCs and communications in Japan is critical.'
In Europe, the PCS standard has been criticised by some industry executives
because it is not an international standard. Intel said, however, that in
addition to the Japanese support announced yesterday several European
telecommunications and computer companies plan to endorse the standard
before the year-end.
Establishing standards for inter-operability is critical if the desktop
video conferencing market is to flourish. It will enable users in different
countries using different types of equipment to participate in video
conference calls.
Mr Yoshi Takayama, director of NEC, said: 'PC-based personal conferencing
capability is expected to be a critical tool to enable the great leap of
personal productivity. NEC is committed to broadening the desktop
conferencing market and is planning to be the first in the Japanese market
to offer the system.'
'We believe it is very important to develop and promote a worldwide standard
such as PCS in the personal conferencing segment,' said Mr Yasunori Kanda,
general manager of Fujitsu Personal Business Division. 'We are going to
introduce PCs with personal conferencing capabilities.'
Just Systems, a leading supplier of Japanese word processing software, said
it would also support the PCS standard and announced plans to link more than
1,000 PCs in its own research laboratories via Intel's Proshare personal
conferencing products.
Intel said it planned to incorporate an existing standard called H320 for
stand-alone room-sized video conferencing systems into its Proshare products
by the end of this year. This will allow Proshare users to take part in
conferences with users of traditional video conferencing equipment. However,
H320 systems do not allow the simultaneous sharing of data and applications.

FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: Row looms over timber
concessions in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Officials at Indonesia's forestry ministry are contradicting each other in
what threatens to escalate into a row between the minister of forestry and
the country's largest timber producer, Barito Pacific Timber.
Earlier this week the forestry minister, Mr Djamaluddin Soeryohadikusomo,
said that if Barito Pacific wanted to renew the licences for its forest
concessions, it would have to hand over as much as 49 per cent of its shares
to a state-owned company.
The minister accused Barito of causing 'considerable' damage to forests
under its control, and said the government wanted its own man in the
company's management to ensure 'sustainable management of its forest
concessions'.
Barito Pacific responded by saying that the minister's comments referred to
two forest concessions in south Kalimantan which did not belong to Barito
Pacific but which did supply the company with logs.
This statement was subsequently supported by the forestry ministry, which
said in a press release that the issue concerned not Barito Pacific Timber
but the forest concessions set up to supply logs to the company.
However, an official at Barito Pacific said the company had been 'helping'
in the management of these two forest concessions over the past five years.
Barito Pacific officials denied the government wanted to take over 49 per
cent of the equity in their company, saying instead that the minister wanted
the state to take a 49 per cent stake in the two companies which own the two
forest concessions in south Kalimantan, Yayang Indonesia and Aya Timber.
The forestry minister is expected to make a further statement today.
Barito Pacific is the world's largest tropical hardwood plywood producer and
a listed company.
It controls some 5m hectares of Indonesian forest.

<TEXT>
Shares in BTR Nylex, the Australian-based industrial group which is
controlled by BTR of the UK, fell more than 10 per cent yesterday after the
company announced profits which disappointed the market.
The company made a profit after tax and minorities of ADollars 207m
(USDollars 153m) in the half-year to June 30, a 6 per cent improvement on
the comparable 1993 figure of ADollars 195.3m. Many analysts, however, had
been expecting profits of around ADollars 240m.
The share price closed on the Australian Exchange at ADollars 2.88, down 30
cents on the day and close to the 52-week low of ADollars 2.76. The stock's
52-week high was ADollars 3.58.
Sales were up by 9.5 per cent at ADollars 3.15bn, while earnings per share
advanced by 2.7 per cent, to 7.7 cents. The interim dividend goes up to 5.25
cents from 5 cents.
Progress looked more significant at the pre-tax level, with profits rising
by 14.4 per cent to ADollars 354.1m, although this was partly due to
slightly lower finance charges of ADollars 74.5m. The company said that
there had been a 'significant upturn in results for the Australasian
business', helped by productivity gains and the improving economy.
North America 'produced outstanding results' and in Europe, Rockware Glass
began to benefit from recent reorganisation and capital investment
programmes. There was an improved performance from the Taiwan Polymer
business, while investments in China contributed 'positively'.
BTR Nylex added that order inflow in recent months had appeared to be
'strengthening and sustainable', and suggested that the 'momentum for
improvement' should continue.

FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: Abnormals affect Boral figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The acquisition of Sagasco and good results from its core Australian
operations helped Boral, the Australian energy and building products group,
to a 34.7 per cent increase in profits to ADollars 280.9m (USDollars
207.7m), after tax but before abnormals, in the year to end-June.
Earnings per share, again before abnormals, were up by 28.6 per cent to 28.3
cents. Sales rose by 10.2 per cent to ADollars 4.65bn.
Large abnormal items severely depressed the bottom-line performance, causing
Boral to post profits after tax and abnormals of ADollars 121.8m, down from
ADollars 228.9m a year ago.
The net abnormal charge was ADollars 159.1m, including a ADollars 121.3m
profit on the sale of the Azon businesses, a ADollars 108.8m write-off of
goodwill, and a ADollars 140.1m provision for rationalisation and
restructuring costs.
The abnormal charge means that Boral is dipping into its reserves to pay a
dividend of 20 cents a share for the year, with the final being an unchanged
10 cents as promised at the time of the rights issue. Directors added that
they were confident the dividend could be maintained, given the significant
effect of abnormal items last year.
Boral said that its core Australian building products business performed
well on the back of the continued strength in the housing industry, as did
the much-enlarged energy business.
The US and European operations - while showing significantly higher profits
than in the previous year - also made unsatisfactory returns, the company
said. However, it noted that 'results in the second half do indicate
significant improvement is under way'.
Boral said trading in the first two months of the current year was ahead of
that recorded in the same period of 1993-94 and ahead of budget.

FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: Solid sales growth lifts Heinz
in first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Solid growth in sales volumes, especially overseas, helped HJ Heinz post
profits after tax of Dollars 154.7m in its fiscal first quarter.
Although net income was only slightly higher than the Dollars 152.2m earned
a year earlier, sales were up 10 per cent at Dollars 1.74bn, reversing the
decline recorded in the previous quarter.
Investors reacted positively to the first-quarter results, and to a
prediction from Mr Tony O'Reilly, the Irish businessman who is chairman of
Heinz, that the company would report higher earnings from on-going
operations for the full year to April 1995.
In late trading, Heinz's shares were up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 36 on the
New York Stock Exchange.
Mr O'Reilly said of the quarter's results and the outlook for earnings: 'The
restructuring of our business portfolio, placing particular emphasis on
food-service, infant feeding and Asia, has put us into growth areas which
should enable us to deliver substantial full-year earnings growth'.
Heinz's sales volume increased by 7 per cent worldwide. Its food-service
business showed strong growth in particular products, notably ketchup,
Ore-Ida frozen potatoes and single-service condiments.
Business was especially impressive in the Asia-Pacific region, with sales
volume in Japan alone rising by 16 per cent.
The first quarter was also an active period for Heinz in terms of further
expansion into European and US markets.
The company bought the Farley's infant food and adult nutrition business in
the UK, and acquired a food-service unit from Borden of the US.
Both transactions were part of Heinz's policy of focusing on its infant food
and food-service businesses.
The acquisitions - net of divestitures - added 2 per cent to sales in the
quarter.

FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: Conoco to spend Pounds 1.7bn in
UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Conoco, the US oil company, yesterday said that about half of its
international investment was destined for the UK.
Mr Constantine Nicandros, chairman of the Houston-based subsidiary of the
DuPont Corporation, confirmed that about Pounds 400m (Dollars 619m) a year
would be spent in the UK throughout the rest of the decade, much of it on
developing new natural gas reserves.
Conoco last week boosted its share of the Britannia gas project to 43 per
cent. Britannia, the biggest remaining undeveloped gas field in the UK
sector of the North Sea, would consume about Pounds 700m of the Pounds 1.7bn
which Conoco plans to spend on UK exploration and development over the
remainder of the decade, Mr Nicandros said.
Initial production from Britannia, expected around 1998, would go to UK
customers. But Conoco was keen to find international markets for the gas
even though a direct route to continental Europe had been ruled out.
Conoco is a member of an industry group studying the feasibility of building
a gas pipeline between the east coast of England and Zeebrugge in Belgium.
Mr Nicandros said Conoco's heavy commitment to the UK stemmed from the fact
that it felt 'very comfortable' with the legal and political environment.
In addition, liberalisation of the domestic gas market would give the
company a chance to use its strong position in gas to make inroads into the
downstream part of the industry.
Conoco, along with PowerGen, owns Kinetica, one of the UK's larger
independent gas marketing companies.
Three-quarters of Conoco's investment programme is aimed overseas, including
its recently launched Polar Lights project in Russia, but Mr Nicandros said
the foreign share would soon fall to 55 - 65 per cent as it assumes a more
'aggressive' role in the expanding US gas market. However, it remained keen
to take advantage of the 'enormous opportunities' arising worldwide from
political change.
This included the possibility of securing deals with politically-sensitive
members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, who wanted
western technology and capital to develop their reserves. 'I don't care what
you call such deals as long as both we and the country have the chance to
make some money,' he said.
Mr Nicandros said there was a danger that the ambitious restructuring among
the US majors and other international oil companies would result in a
misplaced focus on short-term cost-cutting. That could be to the detriment
of creating long-term value, he said.
Although Conoco last year cut Dollars 400m, or 15 per cent, from its cost
base and expected to reduce it by another Dollars 150m this year, 'nobody
ever got rich by cutting costs'.
Mr Nicandros also rejected the notion prevalent among some oil companies
that employees are easily replaceable and transitory figures.
'We've shaken employee loyalty . . . but the social structure of a business
is important. You must give both job and social satisfaction,' he said.
Conoco Australia, part of the Houston-based group, is to partner Australia's
MIM Holdings in the potential development of a coalbed methane gas project
in central Queensland, adds Nikki Tait in Sydney.
The Conoco subsidiary will fund a ADollars 22m (USDollars 16.1m)
exploration, research and trial production programme over the next two to
three years, receiving a 50 per cent stake in the project in return.

Tatra, the ailing Czech truck maker, expects to discuss a strategic alliance
with Liaz, its main Czech rival, to make cabins and other components.
However, an immediate merger has been ruled out.
The company is also considering approaching the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development for up to USDollars 50m and the Czech
government for emergency aid to help it repay debts incurred through a slump
in sales.
Mr Karel Beneda, a former Tatra vice-president, has been appointed acting
chairman to replace Mr Gerald Greenwald, recently appointed head of UAL, the
US airline. He resigned as chairman and general manager of Tatra on
Wednesday along with two senior colleagues.
The three men were forced out by the Tatra board under pressure from
shareholders after Czech directors accused them of not devoting enough time
to the company.
They joined in March last year to help return Tatra to profit after it lost
its traditional markets with the collapse of communism. They were offered a
15 per cent stake if they achieved a turnround, but falling sales meant the
company was unable to capitalise on streamlined production methods and staff
cuts.

FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: US banks take lead in European
M&amp;A
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US investment banks have moved to the forefront in the competition for
advisory work in Europe's cross-border mergers and acquisitions market.
Morgan Stanley topped the rankings for cross-border European activity
between January and June 1994 on a list compiled by the specialist
publication Acquisitions Monthly.
The New York-based firm acted as financial adviser on 13 deals completed in
the first half, worth a total of Pounds 4.95bn (Dollars 7.66bn). Goldman
Sachs, another US investment bank, was second with 16 deals worth Pounds
4.41bn.
They displaced Lazard and Morgan Grenfell, which led the league table in
1993 but fell to ninth and fifth place respectively.
The figures for Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs were boosted by their
involvement on either side of the largest M&amp;A transaction completed in 1994,
the acquisition by Akzo of the Netherlands of Nobel Industries, the Swedish
chemicals and explosives maker.
One such deal can sharply alter a league table based on a relatively short
six-month period. Mr Stephen Waters, head of European investment banking for
Morgan Stanley in Europe, welcomed the firm's showing but noted: 'One
swallow does not make a summer.'
Investment bankers also pointed out that the figures referred to closed
deals, which lag announcements, and therefore give an outdated picture of
the state of competition among investment banks.
Nor does the Acquisitions Monthly table include the privatisation and
joint-venture work which is increasingly important in Europe.

Jardine Fleming International has been appointed joint global co-ordinator
and book-runner, together with Muslim Commercial Bank of Pakistan, of a
placing of 5m vouchers, exchangeable into shares, of Pakistan
Telecommunications Corp (PTC), the country's monopoly telephone service.
A book-building process is now under way and it is believed that the shares
could eventually be placed at between Rps4,500 and Rps5,500 each. The issue
is expected to raise approximately Dollars 750m for the Pakistan government.
The vouchers will be convertible into shares when the PTC is converted into
a privatised company sometime in the next two years.
The move follows a domestic placing of shares, at Rps3,000 each, which was
completed last week. Demand was reported to be strong and the placing is
said to have raised about Dollars 100m.

FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: Texaco faces close vote in
buy-out bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Texaco, the US energy group, faces a close vote today in its attempt to buy
out the minority shareholders in its 78 per cent-owned Canadian offshoot.
The largest minority shareholder, Canadian 88 Energy, on Wednesday raised
the value of its own counter-bid for Texaco Canada Petroleum.
Mr Greg Noval, president of Canadian 88, said Texaco needs the support of
holders of at least half the remaining 22 per cent before it can mount a
compulsory buy-out of all the shares. On that basis, Canadian 88, which in
the last two weeks has built its stake in Texaco Canada to 9.8 per cent,
requires the support of only a few other shareholders to thwart the US
group's plans.
Texaco's offer of CDollars 1.40 a share for the 22 per cent was countered by
a CDollars 1.60 a share offer from Canadian 88, which then lifted its offer
to CDollars 1.65 a share, valuing Texaco Canada at CDollars 208m (USDollars
152m).

FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: Three more departures in Merck
shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Three more senior executives of Merck are to depart in the coming months as
part of a move by Mr Raymond Gilmartin, the US drugs company's new head, to
shape his own senior management team.
The New Jersey-based company also hinted at a broader reorganisation under
Mr Gilmartin. Its new 10-person management committee, announced yesterday,
is intended to serve as 'an example for the company of a leaner, flatter
organisation,' Merck said.
A shake-up has been expected since Mr Gilmartin was brought in to run what
is widely regarded as an in-bred and bureaucratic company.
The latest departures include two of the four executive vice-presidents who
had formed the core of the management group under Mr Ray Vagelos, who
retires as chairman in November.
They are Mr Jerry Jackson, responsible for non-US operations and at one
stage a candidate for the top job, and Mr Frank Spiegel, head of strategic
planning.
Mr Jackson will retire at the end of the year and Mr Spiegel at the end of
October, though both will give up day-to-day responsibilities and serve as
consultants until then.
Merck also said Mr Richard Lane, head of its US human health marketing
operations, is to leave the company to pursue other opportunities.
The reorganised management committee replaces the small group of executives
who formed Mr Vagelos' chairman's staff. Its 10 members include the heads of
Merck's business areas, who will report to Mr Gilmartin.
The only members of the former senior management group to remain are Mr
Edward Scolnick, head of research and manufacturing, Ms Judy Lewent, chief
financial officer, and Ms Mary McDonald, general counsel.

FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: Digital claims new chip is
fastest in the world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Digital Equipment claims to have built the fastest microprocessor in the
world. It is the first commercially available chip that can process more
than a billion instructions a second and is more than twice as fast as
competing chips.
The Alpha 21164 'is the fastest chip on the planet', boasts Mr Robert
Palmer, president and chief executive of the US group.
The 9.3m transistor Alpha microprocessor delivers performance at speeds
previously possible only in large multi-processing systems, such as
expensive supercomputers.
The achievement comes as Digital is undertaking a drastic restructuring of
its operations in an attempt to stem losses that have totalled Dollars 4bn
over the past four years. The company announced in July it would cut 20 per
cent of its workforce, eliminating about 20,000 jobs over the next 12
months.
While Mr Palmer hopes the new Alpha chip will boost customer confidence,
industry analysts say some of the company's most prestigious customers are
turning to competing computer suppliers.
The Alpha chip is recognised as a significant technology breakthrough, but
it is not clear that making the world's fastest microprocessor is a solution
to Digital's problems.
Less than two months ago, Mr Enrico Pesatori, senior vice-president in
charge of Digital's core computer systems business, said that setting record
computing speeds was no longer Digital's primary goal.
'We will concentrate on segments of the market where there are high volume
opportunities,' said Mr Pesatori. 'We will not try to set record speeds with
our products. We want to tie our engineering resources to market needs'.
This, he acknowledged, would be be significant change for Digital. 'Somehow
our engineering resources have become disconnected from the (real needs of)
the market.'
While Digital is winning the microprocessor speed race, it is far outpaced
in terms of market penetration and availability of software by competing
chips, such as Intel's Pentium.
Moreover, the high costs of semiconductor development and production are a
heavy drain on Digital's resources when the company is struggling to cut
costs and selling 'non-strategic' assets.

FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: CarnaudMetalbox flat at FFr510m
in first half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CarnaudMetalbox, the Franco-British packaging group, yesterday reported flat
post-tax profits of FFr510m (Dollars 96m) for the first half of this year,
up FFr1m on the same period last year.
However, Mr Jurgen Hintz, president, said: 'We should be able to produce
some bottom-line progress for 1994 as a whole.'
Turnover rose 4 per cent to FFr12.3bn and operating profits by 7 per cent to
FFr1.04bn as a result of cost containment, job cuts and improved
manufacturing performances.
Net profits barely shifted from the FFr509m in the first half of 1993,
largely because a large part of a capital gain made from the sale of a
Singapore factory site went to minority shareholders, leaving the group with
smaller exceptional financial gains of FFr96m against FFr121m.
CMB's metal packaging business, in its Eurosteel division which accounted
for 54 per cent of total turnover, increased 1 per cent in the first half
because of weak demand from the food sector.
Turnover in health and beauty containers fell 3 per cent and in plastics by
5 per cent, but rose 22 per cent in drink containers because of the good
summer in Europe, where the group did 79 per cent of its total business.
'Whatever you may have heard about recovery in Europe from other sectors, it
clearly did not feed through into consumer products in the first half of
this year,' Mr Hintz said.
For CMB, there already was a two-speed Europe, with demand in the UK, Italy
and Spain - accounting for nearly 40 per cent of turnover - rising by up to
10 per cent. But Germany and the Benelux region only increased 1 per cent
with France falling 7 per cent, he said.
Mr Hintz predicted internal productivity increases and innovations would
more than offset raw material price rises and price pressure from customers,
and would produce a profit increase by end-1994.
He said the group would continue to expand in Europe and Asia, and in the US
perfumes and pharmaceuticals sectors through the new joint venture with
Wheaton. We will be the first to offer customers such as L'Oreal a global
presence', Mr Hintz claimed.

FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: BCP tests Lisbon's sell-off
policy - Judgment on the bid for BPA is due
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Portugal's government will decide within a few days on the most testing
question it has encountered since it started to re-privatise the country's
banks in 1989 - whether to block an attempt by the fifth largest bank to
turn itself at a stroke into a dominant force.
Banco Comercial Portugues (BCP), which has grown rapidly by concentrating on
segments of the banking market, is making a hostile Es132bn (Dollars 825m)
bid for 40 per cent of Banco Portugues do Atlantico (BPA), the biggest
publicly-quoted Portuguese bank.
The reaction of the government, which has been privatising BPA shares in
tranches since 1990, reducing its holding to 24.5 per cent, is
unpredictable. It is wary of appearing to halt the liberalisation of
financial markets, yet it wants to protect orderly progress towards
privatisation.
A successful bid could determine the shape of the banking market, as a
combined BCP/BPA group would hold 24 per cent of banking assets. Provided
BCP's capital was not weakened by paying 2.4 times net asset value for BPA,
it would form the most ambitious and tightly-managed Portuguese bank.
Yet the outcome of the bid is not clear, even if sanctioned by the
government. It depends on the reaction of 13 core shareholders who are
industrialists in northern Portugal. Members of the self-styled Patriotic
Front are insisting that the Es3,000 a share offer is too low.
BCP's rationale for wanting to control BPA is simple. 'We want to grab a
quasi-virgin customer base,' says one BCP senior manager. While BCP has sold
a range of products such as life insurance, BPA has been slower to realise
its potential.
BCP, advised by Merrill Lynch, the US investment bank, was formed by a group
of BPA managers led by Mr Jorge Jardim Goncalves, its chairman. They believe
they can adopt a similar strategy with BPA's 1.9m customers, thus raising
BPA's return on assets and profitability.
BCP managers believe that increased asset size will allow it to compete as
an international bank.
BCP also intends to release capital by selling BPA's stakes in industrial
companies. Some of these stakes are in ventures by members of the
shareholders' group. This is led by Sonae, the largest private sector
industrial and distribution conglomerate, which holds about 6.5 per cent of
BPA.
The bid is not risk-free for BCP. It has built up strong capital and has
been looking for an outlet since it failed in a bid last year to acquire 80
per cent of Banco Pinto &amp; Sotto Mayor, Portugal's sixth biggest bank. A BPA
purchase would leverage its capital and help to maintain returns.
There are dangers. BCP's tier 1 ratio of core capital to risk-weighted
assets would fall from 11.4 per cent to 6.8 per cent, leaving less of a
margin to absorb any increase in non-performing loans.
The bid turns on the reaction of core shareholders because the government
intends to hold its 24.5 per cent stake, and a further 7.5 per cent is held
by another shareholders' group organised by Credit Commercial de France.
This means only another 40.5 per cent of equity is in play.
BCP tried to turn the odds in its favour yesterday when it said its minimum
acceptable stake would be 34.5 per cent. In public, the shareholders are
sticking together. But this unity is under pressure.
BCP has a history of acquiring minority stakes in banks at a high price, and
then paying a lower one to mop up the remaining equity later.
Supporters of BPA - which is being advised by Goldman Sachs and CCF - argue
that this is unfair. Yet the core shareholders have a separate agenda. They
have hired Union Bank of Switzerland to value BPA and its holdings, and plan
to be more involved in management.
BCP supporters argue that core shareholders have tolerated a passive BPA
management in return for favourable treatment. BPA has lent money for
projects such as a shopping and office complex in Lisbon being developed by
Sonae. BPA argues such ventures provided good returns.
BPA's managers say it has been held back by public ownership, but has
embarked on reforms and technological changes which will bear fruit.
Whatever the outcome of the bid, BPA will be a different bank by the time
the dust settles.

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fortis, the Dutch-Belgian financial services group, posted a 9 per cent
increase in second-quarter net profit, with banking profits showing a sharp
rise.
Net profit rose to Ecu154.5m (Dollars 188.5m) from Ecu141.6m a year earlier.
The increase, which followed a 29 per cent rise in the first quarter, takes
first-half results to Ecu264.2m, a 17 per cent improvement on the same
period of 1993.
Fortis, jointly owned by Amev of the Netherlands and AG of Belgium, said
full-year net profit would be 10 per cent to 15 per cent higher than in
1993. This is in spite of plans for unspecified provisions in the second
half for charges to cover internal integration, streamlining and positioning
of the group.
In the first half, pre-tax banking results nearly trebled to Ecu127.1m from
Ecu42.8m a year earlier.
This reflected the first-time consolidation of ASLK-CGER, the Belgian
savings bank group.
Insurance profits rose 13 per cent to Ecu303.4m. Much of the gain was due to
a 32 per cent increase in life insurance results, helped by buoyant results
in the US, the Netherlands and Belgium. The insurance activities of
ASLK-CGER contributed to first-half profits.
Profit from accident and health insurance was virtually unchanged, while
losses in non-life insurance were narrowed to Ecu0.4m from Ecu4.9m.

Carrefour

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Carrefour, one of France's leading hypermarket groups, yesterday continued
the positive trend in the French retail sector, reporting strong underlying
growth in earnings for the first half of 1994.
Although total net profits fell sharply due to a reduction in exceptional
credits, the company estimates there was growth of more than one-third in
net earnings, before exceptional items.
Total net profits for the six months were FFr871m (Dollars 156m), against
FFr1.66bn in the same period of 1993. However, the underlying rate of growth
was stronger than expected, as Carrefour made only FFr101m in exceptional
profits in the 1994 interim period against FFr1.09bn last year, when it sold
the Castorama chain of furniture stores.
The French retail sector has been under pressure for the past two years due
to the static state of consumer spending. However, France is pulling out of
recession and confidence has recovered. This brighter picture is reflected
in the current round of retailers' interim results.
Carrefour was no exception. Sales rose 6.4 per cent during the first half to
FFr61.34bn, against FFr57.64bn.
The company said net profits before exceptional items rose 36.3 per cent to
FFr770m from FFr565m. One of its most buoyant activities was the Pryca
subsidiary with earnings growth of 26 per cent.
Ms Michele Wolff, retailing analyst at Societe Generale securities house in
Paris, said the results were better than expected. She said she would
slightly upgrade her profits forecast for the full financial year.
Carrefour forecast continued sales growth during the autumn to a total of
FFr133bn for the whole of 1994, which would represent a 7.5 per cent
increase on the 1993 total of FFr123bn.
It anticipated further underlying profits growth with net profits before
exceptional items rising 'at the same rate as last year'. This means a 24.3
per cent increase to about FFr2.06bn from FFr1.66bn in 1993.

Ascom, the Swiss tele-communications equipment group, returned to profit in
the first half of 1994 after two years of losses and business and management
upheavals.
The group reported a pre-tax profit of SFr21m (USDollars 16m) in the six
months to June 30 compared with a loss of SFr79m in the same period last
year.
At the operating level, the group showed a profit of SFr3m compared with a
SFr68m loss.
Ascom attributed the turnround to cost cutting, concentration on core
businesses and extraordinary gains on disposals, and was hopeful of making a
profit in the full year. 'We won't make a loss and I hope we can make a
positive net profit,' said Mr Fred Sutter, chief executive.
The telecommunications equipment division doubled its operating income to
SFr33m on sales up 12 per cent to SFr751m. Ascom is a leader in the
fast-growing cordless telephone business.
The service automation division also doubled its operating profit to SFr28m
on flat sales of SFr436m. The division supplies coin and card phones and
ticket vending machines.
However, the US-based enterprise networks division continued to disappoint,
with a loss of SFr8m on sales down 2 per cent to SFr209m. Mr Felix Wittlin,
the new chairman, said he was convinced that the business of Ascom Timeplex,
acquired three years ago, was sustainable, but research projects were costly
and risky.

FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: KHD cuts deficit as new orders
rise 60%

<TEXT>
Klockner-Humboldt-Deutz, the German engineering group, yesterday reported a
60 per cent increase in new orders in the first half, during which it cut
its interim net loss to DM93m (Dollars 60m) from DM98m.
The company, which had warned earlier of a 'typical' first-half deficit,
said operating earnings had improved markedly, but the bottom-line figure
had been reduced by heavy launch costs and restructuring measures.
It forecast an unchanged break-even result for the full year and said all
the turnover increase in the review period - DM1.35bn compared with DM1.28bn
 -had come from foreign sales.
Overseas turnover rose 16 per cent while domestic revenues shrank 8 per
cent.
Sales of engines and other drive components rose 4.5 per cent and
agricultural equipment improved 18 per cent, while industrial plant turnover
fell 26 per cent.
The group's order book was lifted by a 163 per cent rise in demand for
industrial plant, while the drives and farm machinery divisions booked
increases of 20 per cent and 29 per cent respectively.

FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Strong margins rise helps Royal Doulton to
Pounds 2.62m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong improvement in manufacturing margins helped Royal Doulton, the
china table ware group, report pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.62m for the first
half of 1994, against losses of Pounds 3.79m.
Sales were 4.4 per cent ahead at Pounds 101m, against Pounds 96.7m.
Excluding currency effects the advance was 5.3 per cent.
Mr Stuart Lyons, chief executive, said the group had enjoyed a good start to
the year in spite of difficulties in North America and Japan. Order books
were running at their highest levels since 1989 and demand was estimated to
be some 3 to 4 per cent ahead of last year.
This had allowed the factories to return to five-day working compared with
four-day last year, and helped to improve factory margins from 42 to 44 per
cent.
Profits were also enhanced by the absence of Pounds 3.1m in non-recurring
items which arose as a result of the December demerger from Pearson, the
media conglomerate which owns the Financial Times.
The group's first half was marred by difficulties in the North American
distribution businesses, which fell victim to aggressive price cutting from
competitors. The group had been forced to introduce cuts of between 8 and 15
per cent.
Mr Lyons said improved efficiency in the factories, higher output margins
and rising sales allowed the group to cut prices there without any impact on
profitability. Nevertheless, market share had fallen and North America now
accounted for 30 per cent of overall sales, against 33 per cent last year.
Japan, where Royal Doulton has a 50 per cent owned joint venture, remained
very competitive, and gross margins fell. Losses attributable to Royal
Doulton came to Pounds 300,000. The group was in the process of buying the
outstanding 50 per cent for Pounds 5m.
The dividend was set at 1.75p, an increase of 6 per cent on the notional
dividend announced at the demerger. Earnings per share were 3.3p, against
losses of 8.4p.
The shares closed 3p up at 310p. This represents a 60 per cent gain in the
nine months since the group was demerged at 193p.

FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Avonside rises 20% to Pounds 2.64m
</HEADLINE>

   By KATRINA LOWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Avonside Group reported a 20 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits from
Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 2.64m and also announced plans for a phased withdrawal
from housebuilding, writes Katrina Lowe.
Mr Christopher Glynn, chairman, said the group intended to focus on building
services and distribution. It had entered into an agreement with the
management of Parry Homes, its larger housebuilding subsidiary, under which
its land bank would be progressively developed and sold.
In the first half, sales grew to Pounds 38.3m (Pounds 28.5m), including
Pounds 28.1m (Pounds 20m) from building services. Operating profits from
services increased to Pounds 2.03m (Pounds 1.39m) but housebuilding's input
fell to Pounds 947,000 (Pounds 1.08m) due to pressure on margins.
Avonside is raising its interim dividend to 2.1p (1.9p) on earnings per
share of 3.9p (3.41p).
The Parry agreement allows, subject to certain targets, for Parry to be sold
to its management, led by Mr Robert Palin, the managing director.

FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Coopers &amp; Lybrand settles TGI claim
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte has settled a longstanding legal claim by TGI, an
electronics company which had accused the accountancy firm of negligence.
Coopers continues to deny the charge but has said it will pay TGI Pounds
725,000 in final settlement.
The agreement ends a dispute whose origins lie in TGI's acquisition of
Audix, Coopers' audit client. TGI took over Audix, a maker of public address
systems, in 1989 and agreed a price linked to its new subsidiary's
subsequent earnings.
Coopers signed off on Audix's 1989-1990 results but the profits reported for
the financial year were later restated as a loss. TGI asked Coopers to
resign and began legal proceedings.
Coopers' move to conclude the Audix affair follows a similar decision
recently by a fellow Big Six firm. Touche Ross undertook to pay Pounds 1.35m
to Caparo, a conglomerate which took over a Touche client, Fidelity, the
electronics company. Both Coopers and Touche settled rather than risk the
public scrutiny of their auditing procedures in court.

FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Disposal helps Manders advance to Pounds
18m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Roy Amos, chairman of Manders, said yesterday that in a 'transitional'
first half the group had moved from the third to the first division in the
international coatings and printing inks league.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 18.3m for the six months to June 30 marked a sharp
increase on last time's Pounds 4.92m. However, the latest figure included a
Pounds 13.2m profit from the Pounds 55m disposal of the decorative paints
division. Stripping out that item and including interest payable of Pounds
446,000 (Pounds 965,000) gives underlying profits only marginally up at
Pounds 5.06m.
The shares closed down 4p at 349p.
In January Manders bought the inks business of Croda International for
Pounds 26.7m and in May spent Pounds 38m on Premier Inks of the Netherlands.
It also completed the sale of the Mander Centre, its Wolverhampton shopping
centre, for Pounds 82m.
Mr Roger Akers, chief executive, said that the group, 'now the fastest thing
coming up on the rails,' had always been strong technologically.
Excluding the recent Pounds 14m acquisition of Morrison-PIM, the group
employed 165 chemists from a total of 800 people.
Its biggest competitors were now Sun-Dainippon, the US-Japan venture, BASF
of Germany and Total of France.
Mr Amos confirmed that further expansion in Europe was being sought through
acquisition, probably of small or medium-sized companies, although he did
not rule out larger targets.
At June 30 Manders had cash balances in the UK of Pounds 32m, though the
Morrison buy has reduced that figure. Mr Amos said he would be comfortable
with gearing of up to about 30 per cent.
Margins had suffered in the UK from the change of business mix and would be
1 percentage point lower at 8.5 per cent in 1994. It was hoped they would be
lifted via innovative products, such as cold set printing inks of the same
quality as heat set. The aim was for a 10 per cent margin within 'a year or
so.'
Earnings swelled to 32.52p (9.02p) on an FRS 3 basis, but were flat once
adjusted. The interim dividend is held at 2.9p.

FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Property sale behind rise at Laing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in John Laing, the construction, housebuilding and property
development group, fell 21p to 269p after the company revealed that its
construction business operated only at break even in the first six months of
this year.
Group pre-tax profits, however, more than doubled to Pounds 11.9m (Pounds
5.1m) boosted by Pounds 9.9m of profits from the sale of a Belfast retail
development to MEPC property group.
The company is paying a maintained dividend of 3p out of earnings per share
of 9.4p (4.1p) after property profits.
The construction business earned operating profits of Pounds 5.2m in the
first six months of 1993. Mr Martin Laing, chairman, said
the business had been undermined by too many companies chasing too little
business in the UK, forcing them to bid for work at minimal or lossmaking
margins.
There was also strong international competition for overseas construction
work where margins, although better than in the UK, also were tight.
The group's strategy has been to invest in domestic and international
private sector infrastructure projects including the Second Severn Crossing
in the UK and power station projects in Malaysia.
These were expected to produce a more consistent and higher rate of return
than general contracting, but were unlikely to make a significant
contribution until the mid to late 1990s.
Europistas, the Spanish toll road company in which Laing has an 18 per cent
stake, however, was expected to generate dividends this year of Pounds 3.4m
against a book cost of Pounds 3m.
The first dividends from the Malaysian power station operation are expected
next year, while the Severn Bridge is due to be completed in 1996.
Elsewhere the company's UK housebuilding side recovered from a Pounds 2.5m
loss to a Pounds 2.1m profit. Property development profit, excluding the
Belfast surplus, fell from Pounds 5.2m to Pounds 3m.
COMMENT
Laing's strategy of selective investment in privately financed
infrastructure projects cannot be faulted. It has made more progress in this
area than any other UK company, barring perhaps Trafalgar House. It has a
strong balance sheet, with net cash of Pounds 16.2m in June. Pre-tax profits
of Pounds 22m this year and only slightly higher next year, when the tax
charge may be about 20 per cent, put the group on a prospective p/e of about
17 for both years. This looks expensive, but patient shareholders may find
it worth the wait.

FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Improved OGC helps Fairhaven to Dollars
7.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATRINA LOWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The continuing success of its Aberdeen oil services activities helped OGC
International, the main asset of Fairhaven International, to increase
pre-tax profits by 9.5 per cent from Pounds 5.33m to Pounds 5.83m in the
first half of 1994.
Its Bermuda-registered parent, in which Fred Olsen has a 37.28 per cent
holding, reported pre-tax profits of Dollars 7.1m (Pounds 4.58m). The
previous interim profit of Dollars 37.4m was inflated by the Dollars 30m
proceeds from the flotation of 40 per cent of OGC.
Mr Richard Wilson, OGC chairman, said yesterday that the joint venture of
AOC International, its main operating subsidiary, Brown &amp; Root had added a
further two contracts.
Sales rose 18 per cent to Pounds 114.1m (Pounds 97.1m) at OGC. The
Australian subsidiary, full ownership of which was acquired in December,
contributed Pounds 10.8m of the growth. An interim dividend of 1.8375p has
been declared, from earnings per share of 6.10p (5.69p).
Fairhaven said the impact of the improved performance by OGC was offset by a
less favourable result at Belmont Constructors Inc. Group turnover of
Dollars 237.2m (Dollars 207m)included Dollars 66m (Dollars 60.5m) from
Belmont, reflecting increased activity in the industrial sectors which the
subsidiary serves, as well as a new marketing team.
The interim dividend is maintained at 0.5 cents on earnings of 0.88 cents
(13.85 cents).

FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Newman Tonks emerges with Pounds 9.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Newman Tonks, the biggest manufacturer in Europe of architectural hardware,
has emerged from its extensive reorganisation with a 20 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits in the six months to June 30.
Profits grew to Pounds 9.7m (Pounds 8.11m) on total turnover of Pounds
135.6m (Pounds 128.7m). The shares eased 1p to 176p.
Mr Geoff Gahan, chief executive, said that as much reorganisation as was
necessary at the moment had been carried out.
In the half year only a further 50 net jobs from a total of 4,500 had been
lost. Between 1990 and June 1993 some 18 per cent of the workforce had been
shed.
Mr Gahan said that although he believed the recession in the construction
industry - in which 90 per cent of Tonks' business is involved - had ended,
the recovery had not yet begun. However, he conceded that there had been 'a
strengthening in the forward order position.'
The US turned in the brightest performance, with operating profits up 50 per
cent to Pounds 2.96m on turnover 10 per cent ahead at Pounds 29.6m.
With the US recession, and the subsequent rationalisation there, pre-dating
the European downturn by two to three years, the transatlantic business now
had high operational gearing, where higher volumes quickly fed through to
the profits line. Mr Gahan hoped the same process would be repeated in the
UK and Europe, the group's other main markets.
UK profits rose by 5 per cent to Pounds 4.24m on turnover fractionally up at
Pounds 81.9m (Pounds 81.4m).
Mr Gahan said he wanted profits to grow on the back of new products - the
group spends about Pounds 8m a year on research and development. These costs
are charged to the UK operation.
At June 30, borrowings stood at Pounds 33.6m (Pounds 27.9m at December 31)
for gearing of 48 per cent. The increase followed April's Pounds 2.1m
redemption of convertible preference shares and a Pounds 3.5m US
acquisition.
Earnings rose 35 per cent to 5.04p (3.73p) and the interim dividend 9 per
cent to 2.75p (2.53p).
Mr Gahan said he wanted to lift cover as well as the payment.

FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Arjo Wiggins jumps 67% - No sign of
slowdown as paper industry pulls out of recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the Anglo-French paper company, reported a 67 per
cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 63m to Pounds 105.1m in the
first half of this year, as the paper industry began to pull itself out of a
worldwide recession.
'There is no sign of a slowdown: prospects for the second half of the year
look extremely good as long as we can struggle to pass on pulp price
increases,' said Mr Alain Soulas, chief executive.
The company has been hit by wood pulp price increases of 45 per cent this
year as the improvement in the market has led to a worldwide shortage of raw
material.
Mr Soulas indicated that, for coated and carbonless grades of paper, the
company had managed to pass on the price rises, but had little success in
the fine paper market.
In addition, since June there have been two further pulp increases -
amounting to Ecu 100 a tonne - which the company must try and pass on in the
next couple of months.
Mr Soulas said that European paper prices in June had only recovered to the
same level as in June last year after dropping in some cases by 25 per cent
in the second half of last year.
Turnover was virtually unchanged at Pounds 1.44bn (Pounds 1.43bn) in the
period, while sales volume increased by four per cent. Earnings per share
were up 50 per cent to 8.1p, from 5.4p last time before exceptional costs.
The company held the interim dividend steady at 2.65p.
Mr Tim Rothwell, pulp and paper analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the
London stockbrokers, said: 'The market has under-estimated the upturn in the
company and the result turned out above the top range of analysts'
forecasts.
COMMENT
Arjo Wiggins is well placed to take advantage of the cyclical upturn which
has improved the fortunes of European paper companies. But without its own
integrated pulp production, it is at the mercy of relentlessly rising raw
materials costs and must struggle to pass these on to an unreceptive paper
market. The company recognises this could lead to a squeeze on margins in
the second half, but is nevertheless, optimistic. Paper prices are still 30
per cent lower than the last peak in the market in 1989, suggesting that
there is potential for substantial price hikes. British investors may fear
that the imminent departure of Mr Tony Isaac, the finance director, may
leave their interests unrepresented on a board with no other British
executive directors except Mr Cob Stenham, the chairman. Analysts have
upgraded their forecasts for the full year on the basis of yesterday's
results and expect pre-tax profits of between Pounds 175m and Pounds 205m
and earnings per share of 16p. Next year, the company is estimated to earn
Pounds 290m or 21.5p a share with the figure going up to Pounds 340m in
1996. At 287p the share price is not expensive for investors who want to
take a bet on the next peak in the paper cycle.

FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Hall Engineering down sharply to Pounds
2.01m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hall Engineering (Holdings), the automotive engineering, steel products and
stockholding group, suffered a sharp fall in first-half pre-tax profits from
Pounds 3.75m to Pounds 2.01m but expects a better performance in the second
half of the year.
Turnover was up 10 per cent from Pounds 65m to Pounds 72.1m.
The interim dividend is reduced from 6.48p a share to 5p, but for the second
year running the Shrewsbury-based company is offering an 'enhanced' scrip
alternative.
Earnings per share fell from 8.2p to 3.78p.
Shareholders are to be given the option of taking up new shares based on a
50 per cent enhancement to the cash dividend. For Hall, which derives its
profits principally from abroad, the offer will reduce the amount of Advance
Corporation Tax which it has to write off, and save about Pounds 2m of cash
in a full year.
If the scrip dividend is approved a final dividend at least equal to the
3.02p final payout last year is expected, making a total of at least 8.02p
for 1994 (9.5p). Otherwise, the interim dividend would be 3.3p.
Once again, the half-year results underline the importance for Hall of its
associated companies, especially in the Pacific Basin. Even so, its share of
profits from associated companies was Pounds 2.64m, down from Pounds 3.2m a
year earlier, partly owing to increasing competitive pressure for BRC in
Singapore.
Elsewhere, operating profit for the three core businesses, stockholding,
steel reinforcement and engineering, dropped from Pounds 1.54m in the first
half of 1993 to Pounds 493,000.
The stockholding business had a small loss of Pounds 46,000, compared with a
profit of Pounds 366,000 a year ago, while reinforcement slipped from a
Pounds 117,000 profit to a Pounds 339,000 loss. The engineering business saw
profits fall from Pounds 1.05m to Pounds 878,000. However, Mr Richard Hall,
chairman, said stockholding was likely to make a 'very significant' profit
in the second half, due to improved margins, and the reinforcement business
was now looking much healthier.
The greatest uncertainty remained at Stadco in the engineering division,
which has already been hit by postponement of part of a big production
equipment contract for Audi. Stadco may have to declare 60 redundancies in
the second half, costing as much as Pounds 500,000, if it fails to win two
further big contracts from Volkswagen, worth Pounds 10m each.
Even so, Mr Hall said he would be disappointed if the group's profits fell
below Pounds 4.5m this year.

FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Food falls Pounds 0.8m into red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reorganisation and restructuring costs totalling Pounds 684,000 pushed
Yorkshire Food Group, the Bradford-based food processor floated in March
last year, Pounds 780,000 into the red in the first half.
However, turnover for the six months to June 24 advanced by 72 per cent from
Pounds 29.5m to Pounds 50.6m following the first full-term contribution from
last August's acquisition of Del Monte's dried fruit business in California.
Integrating the acquisition and repackaging the Del Monte brand for the US
market accounted for Pounds 587,000 of the restructuring charge.
The seasonal nature of the business means that profits are weighted towards
the second half, when 60 per cent of annual trading is done. Last year's
first half ended in a pre-tax loss of Pounds 376,000.
Mr Mike Firth, chairman and chief executive, said yesterday that the overall
performance was much better than the previous first-half, and he was
confident of a satisfactory outcome for the year.
The increase in turnover, mainly from the US, included organic growth of 16
per cent. Higher direct sales to manufacturers, both in the UK and the US,
accounted for 13 per cent and 9 per cent of turnover respectively.
This has reduced the group's dependence on UK retailers, which accounted for
19 per cent of sales, down from 24 per cent.
Net interest payable rose from Pounds 462,000 to Pounds 707,000, reflecting
increased working capital, higher stocks ahead of the imminent Del Monte
relaunch in the US, and Pounds 3m of investment in plant and machinery in
the UK and the US.
The loss per share was down from 2.19p to 2.06p. The interim dividend was
increased to 0.80p (0.72p).

FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Shares fall 29p as Litho advance is less
than expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Litho Suppliers, the printing products distributor which came to
the market last November, fell 29p to close at 197p yesterday after it
reported a lower-than-expected interim pre-tax profits increase of 10 per
cent to Pounds 2.5m.
Turnover at the Midlands-based group was marginally ahead at Pounds 30.2m
(Pounds 29.7m) helped by a 29 per cent rise to Pounds 1.7m in sales of
traditional equipment such as plate and film processors and graphic arts
cameras. Sales of consumables such as printing plates, films and chemicals,
which account for 83 per cent of total turnover, advanced by 2 per cent to
Pounds 25.1m. The division has increased the number of own-label products.
Mr John Byford, joint managing director, said small and medium-sized
companies, Litho's main customers, were still experiencing a patchy
recovery. 'However, the recent recovery experienced by some larger printers
may now feed through,' he added.
Cost of sales rose from Pounds 23.9m to Pounds 24.5m and operating profits
fell from Pounds 2.8m to Pounds 2.5m. Operating margins remained 19 per
cent.
Net interest charges fell from Pounds 593,000 to Pounds 49,000 following the
decision to use most of the proceeds of last year's Pounds 14.1m placing and
intermediaries offer to cut borrowing. Net cash stood at Pounds 2.2m.
Litho has acquired Lonchem, a chemical products manufacturer, for Pounds 1m
and is set to buy a printing inks manufacturer.
The interim dividend is 2.73p, a 5 per cent rise over the level indicated in
last year's prospectus. Earnings per share were 6.1p (6.3p).

FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Job loss programme proceeds on schedule
despite being slowed by culture shift - Robert Corzine considers the
reorganisation being undertaken by British Gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Cedric Brown, British Gas' chief executive, yesterday said the radical
reorganisation was proceeding on schedule.
An additional 3,000 people being made redundant in the first half brings the
year-on-year total to 10,000.
His comments, at the second-quarter results presentation, came after some
analysts questioned the relatively slow pace of the programme, announced
earlier this year. It involves the separation of the company into five
business units and the loss of 25,000 jobs, a third of the workforce, over
the next three to four years.
However the heads of two of the main units, TransCo, the transportation and
storage arm, and Public Gas Supply, the domestic trading division, say
substantial progress is being made.
Mr Harry Moulson, managing director of the Solihull-based TransCo, notes
that under the old system there were '13 management levels between the chief
executive and the guy who dug holes in the road. We are now going for five
or six.'
The top tiers of management had now been appointed, with mid-level and more
junior supervisory slots soon to be filled. Mr Moulson says the way British
Gas is conducting the restructuring, by filling management posts from the
top down to allow each new layer of managers to determine the roles of those
under their control, is one reason that the exercise was not moving more
quickly.
The broad range of structural and cultural changes which TransCo is trying
to introduce has also slowed the process. In addition to the complex task of
splitting up an integrated company, executives are trying to change a
business culture steeped in strict command and control to one in which
'people will have a go and try things'.
An even greater cultural shift will be required at the trading arm,
according to Mr Mike Alexander, managing director of Public Gas Supply, the
unit that will have to compete with independent gas marketing companies when
the domestic market is opened up from the beginning of 1996.
Of the 7,000 people in his division, only '80-100 actually work for PGS,' he
says. The remainder will have to compete for their jobs, a process that
promises to be intense.
He says closure of district and regional offices will build up over the next
year or so. The first office closes in October and nine are due to be shut
by the end of the first quarter next year. Those with the largest staffs
will be closed by the end of 1995, by which time the number of district
offices in his division will have fallen from 23 to eight or nine.
Mr Alexander says British Gas workers last year questioned why they were be
forced to undergo such radical changes. They now simply ask: 'When will I
know I have a job?'
But he accepts there is still some resistance within the ranks. There are
reports, for example, that some British Gas officials are engaged in efforts
to preserve threatened jobs. There are also reports that jobs continue to be
created, even in departments earmarked for sharp staff reductions.

FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Spurs blame 'draconian' FA fine for sharp
fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tottenham Hotspur, the quoted North London football club, yesterday blamed a
sharp fall in profits on a 'draconian' fine over irregular payments to
players.
Shares in the company closed down 10p at 143p after the group said pre-tax
profits fell from Pounds 3.36m to Pounds 885,000 in the year to May 31.
Mr Alan Sugar, the club's combative chairman, said the decline was due
mainly to 'the outrageous fine handed down by the Football Association'.
The company is understood to be considering legal action over the Pounds
1.5m penalty which, together with tax payments to the Inland Revenue,
contributed to exceptional items of Pounds 1.79m.
Following 'these unsavoury events', Mr Sugar said the board had decided to
pay only a token dividend of 1p, compared with a 5p pay-out last time.
The club chairman, who also heads the electronics group Amstrad, said he was
waiving his entitlement to dividends worth Pounds 81,000 on his 50.88 per
cent shareholding.
Operating profits, meanwhile, fell from Pounds 3.16m to Pounds 1.14m on
reduced turnover of Pounds 22.3m (Pounds 25.3m).
The figures were undermined by losses on player trading of Pounds 656,000,
against a profit of Pounds 1.82m in 1993 following the sale of Paul
Gascoigne to Lazio, the Italian club.
Earnings per share fell from 19.1p to 3.7p.
Nevertheless, the group's merchandising division defied the difficulties
affecting the club by reporting profits of Pounds 339,000 (Pounds 208,000
losses).
The club, which has spent more than Pounds 5m on new players since the year
end, was now well placed 'to go forward profitably', according to Mr Sugar.
Spending on the players - Jurgen Klinsmann and Ilie Dumitrescu - is said to
have been financed from cash resources and bank borrowings, which stood at
Pounds 2.6m at the year end.

FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Emap seeks Pounds 77m for further
acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Emap is about to return to the takeover trail, funded by, in what is
becoming its regular method, a substantial rights issue.
The media and exhibitions group's interests include a wide range of consumer
magazines.
It plans to raise Pounds 77.2m net of expenses from a 1 for 8 rights issue
at 360p a share, underwritten by Schroders, the merchant bank.
Sir John Hoskyns, chairman of Emap, said yesterday it continued 'to see
attractive opportunities to make small to medium-size acquisitions, which
complement our core businesses.'
The rights issue would allow it to maintain 'an appropriate level of
borrowings consistent with the cash generative nature of its businesses and
their prospects in the light of the company's expectations for further
growth in the economy.'
It is believed that an acquisition could come in a couple of weeks, followed
by another within the next two months.
Both are believed to be in the UK and in the business and consumer magazines
divisions.
Within the next six months, if potential deals go well, more than half of
the latest rights issue could be spent on targets which have already been
identified.
In June 1992 Emap raised Pounds 78m through its first rights issue for eight
years. The first acquisition to follow, the Pounds 12.6m purchase of the
Northampton Mercury Company, came almost immediately. It was joined in
August 1992 by the Pounds 4.9m purchase of the Local Government Chronicle.
By April this year Emap had spent Pounds 74m on acquisitions, the largest of
which was the purchase for Pounds 27.8m of Thomson Business Magazines in
February 1993.
The pattern of the past two years is likely to continue - the purchase of
small to medium-sized companies, without taking on unacceptable levels of
debt.
Emap does not, however, rule out a very large acquisition if the right
opportunity presents itself, although there is no sign of that at the
moment.
Since April, Emap has spent a further Pounds 105m in acquiring 38 magazines
in France.
It has also made an unconditional offer to acquire the balance of Trans
World Communications, the commercial radio group, which it does not already
own. This will result in payments of about Pounds 50m.
Emap's last annual report said it was experiencing what it expected to be a
gradual, but long term, improvement in advertising, which accounted for
about 50 per cent of total revenue.
Yesterday Emap said this continued to be the case and that it was 'making
progress in line with expectations.'
The rights issue was received well in the City and the share price fell by
only 3 1/2p to 414 1/2p.

FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Princedale tops Pounds 909,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In line with the chairman's forecast at the AGM in April, profits of
Princedale Group showed a marked improvement in the six months to June 30.
The USM-quoted marketing services and industrial concern reported pre-tax
profits of Pounds 909,000 on turnover of Pounds 21.6m for the 1994 first
half, against a loss of Pounds 71,000 on turnover of Pounds 4.47m for the
first six months of the previous 15-month reporting period.
The outcome also compared favourably with the profit of Pounds 740,000
achieved for the whole of that 15 months.
Earnings for the six months emerged at 1.4p per share, against losses of
0.3p for the comparable period and earnings of 1.9p for the whole of the
previous 15 months.
The interim dividend is restored with a 0.2p pay-out.

FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Canadian Pizza down 14% after warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Canadian Pizza, which issued a profits warning in April just five months
after flotation, yesterday reported a 14 per cent fall in interim profits
and a 6 per cent drop in sales.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to July 2 fell from Pounds 1.66m to
Pounds 1.42m. Sales fell from Pounds 8.82m to Pounds 8.28m.
The shares, floated last November at 200p, closed yesterday 5p ahead at
105p.
The profits warning followed a slowdown in sales to UK retail customers and
a decision by J Sainsbury, its biggest client, to stop buying pizza crusts
for its delicatessen operations.
Yesterday the company said the difficult climate was persisting. Sales to UK
retailers, accounting for 50 per cent of turnover, were down 11 per cent.
But the company had succeeded in obtaining nine new UK retail customers.
Sales from the catering division were also down, by 21 per cent. However,
exports were 5 per cent ahead, and sales of crusts to other pizza makers
were ahead by 22 per cent.
Pizza crust sales were 19 per cent up by volume, but only 4 per cent by
value, reflecting the pressure on margins and the changing customer base.
Earnings per share were 5.7p (6.5p). The interim dividend is 2.4p.

FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: British Gas maintains dividend at 6.4p -
Sharp drop in oil prices and lower UK gas sales contribute to fall to Pounds
630m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas yesterday announced that it was holding its interim dividend at
6.4p, ending, at least temporarily, speculation that it was about to cut the
dividend in response to growing domestic competition and regulatory
uncertainty.
Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive, said the company would clarify its
longer-term dividend policy on September 29, when it would disclose details
of the strategic direction of the company.
Analysts had suggested that British Gas might use the excuse of regulatory
pressure to correct what some see as the company's over distribution. The
company pays about Pounds 700m a year in dividends.
Mr Brown made his comments after the company reported a reduced second
quarter net loss on an historical cost basis of Pounds 4m, against Pounds
16m last time. Losses per share were 0.1p (0.4p). Second quarter figures are
usually distorted by a seasonal downturn in demand.
Half-year profits fell to Pounds 630m (Pounds 634m) because of lower UK gas
sales and the sharp fall in oil prices in the first quarter. Earnings per
share were 14.5p (14.7p)
Although cold weather boosted gas sales in the company's remaining monopoly
markets by 1 per cent, volumes in the competitive markets fell by 20 per
cent.
This was offset by a Pounds 80m increase in transportation income as
TransCo, the monopoly pipeline division, benefited from increased volumes
from independent gas marketing companies.
Profits from exploration and production were down sharply from Pounds 196m
to Pounds 138m. This was because of low oil prices and the temporary closure
of the Morecambe Bay gas field, one of the company's lowest-cost reserves.
The figures also include a Pounds 10m loss from Bow Valley, the Canadian
subsidiary whose sale was finalised in August.
Capital expenditure was Pounds 150m lower than in the first half of 1993,
and would be probably be lower for the full year, according to Mr Philip
Rogerson, finance director.
Cash flow was boosted by disposal proceeds from the Pounds 609m sale of
Consumers Gas in Canada.

FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Blue Circle's advance fails to please
investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Blue Circle, Britain's biggest cement group, yesterday announced a 46 per
cent rise in underlying profits, but this was not enough to prevent its
share price falling by 14p to 300p.
Profit taking and concern that the recovery in UK cement demand will slow
next year took the gloss off the half-year figures.
Profits from continuing businesses rose from Pounds 60.5m to Pounds 88.4m.
This represented a further substantial improvement on profit increases of 77
per cent and 31 per cent in the two preceding six-month periods, said Mr
Keith Orrell-Jones, group managing director.
However, a Pounds 40.3m provision - of which Pounds 35.1m was due to a
goodwill write-off on the sale of the New World cookers business - depressed
pre-tax profits which fell from Pounds 60.5m to Pounds 48.1m.
Earnings per share, before exceptionals, rose from 5p to 7.5p. The interim
dividend is being maintained at 3.75p.
The UK cement division led the first-half improvement with operating profits
more than doubled to Pounds 28.2m (Pounds 12.1m) on the back of an 11 per
cent volume increase and a 1 per cent rise in prices compared with the first
six months of 1993.
Operating margins of 18 per cent on expected UK sales of 6.5m tonnes this
year are now not far short of the peak of 22 per cent on 9m tonnes in 1989.
Mr Orrell-Jones said the biggest reason for the improvement was cost-savings
worth Pounds 2m a month, introduced in the previous two years.
US cement, concrete and aggregates profits also rose sharply from Pounds
6.6m to Pounds 11m, helped by improved efficiencies and higher prices.
Profits would have increased further but for bad winter weather.
Cement and concrete profits in Chile had risen slightly to Pounds 17.6m
(Pounds 16.5m) but reduced demand for high-rise buildings in Santiago meant
that sales were likely to come under pressure.
Elsewhere, African profits rose from Pounds 5.5m to Pounds 8.9m, while
Malaysian profits slipped from Pounds 9.9m to Pounds 8.9m.
Home products profits rose only slightly to Pounds 24.5m (Pounds 24.2m) but
this masked improved profits from Italy, Sweden and France, as well as from
UK bathrooms. Profits from Germany fell, as did those from UK heating.
COMMENT
Blue Circle has done a tremendous job in cutting costs. The pace of
improvement, however, is likely to diminish with UK cement volumes expected
to increase by about 2 per cent next year compared with 8 per cent in 1994.
Construction recovery in the US is also likely to slow, while there is a
limit on how much more margin Blue Circle's good housekeeping can generate
in building materials. This may not be a problem if the home products
business finally delivers, but this market remains tough in the UK. Pre-tax
profits this year of Pounds 200m (after New World provisions) and Pounds
270m next places the shares on prospective multiples of 19 and 13, which
looks dear enough.

FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Sun Alliance near trebled at Pounds 180m -
Further restructuring at Swinton will involve 64 branch closures and Pounds
8m provision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sun Alliance, the composite insurer, yesterday reported a near-tripling of
pre-tax profits from Pounds 61.7m to Pounds 180.2m for the first six months
of 1994.
The results were in line with analysts' forecasts and continued the
recovery, particularly in the UK market, seen among the other general
insurers.
However, there was evidence of increasing competition in the UK home and
motor insurance markets, where premium income retreated 11 per cent to
Pounds 443m (Pounds 501m).
The company also announ-ced a further restructuring of its Swinton high
street insurance intermediary, which will involve the closure of about 64
out of a total of 690 branches and a provision of Pounds 8m.
The turnround in the UK overall resulted in an underwriting profit of Pounds
33m, against a Pounds 100.6m loss.
Mr Roger Taylor, chief executive, said: 'This was achieved as a result of
the consistent application of firm underwriting practice.' Tighter risk
selection and rating measures had also contributed.
The underwriting loss including Sun Alliance's overseas business fell to
Pounds 36.8m (Pounds 153.1m).
Premium income from the UK commercial insurance business increased Pounds
16m to Pounds 469m, although the life insurance side was hit by slack demand
in the housing market and slipped Pounds 9m to Pounds 364m. Investment
income, on the other hand, grew 5 per cent to Pounds 186.1m (Pounds 177.3m).
Overall, premium income from general insurance increased from Pounds 1.73bn
to Pounds 1.79bn. Life insurance premium income grew 13 per cent to Pounds
576.9m (Pounds 509m).
The solvency margin, which measures non-life premium income as a percentage
of net assets, was 56 per cent, compared with 64 per at the year-end. Net
assets stood at Pounds 1.72bn, against Pounds 2.01bn.
Earnings per share increased from 5.2p to 18.2p, while the interim dividend
has been raised 4.8 per cent to 5.5p.
COMMENT
There was much to be cheerful about in yesterday's results from Sun
Alliance. But, as the restructuring at Swinton shows, the company is more
heavily exposed than any of its competitors to the UK insurance market, with
rates beginning to soften and competition from direct sellers beginning to
bite. Forecast profits of Pounds 375m-Pounds 420m mean the company could
produce earnings of 41p. A dividend increase to 15.75p for the full year
would give a prospective yield of 5.9 per cent. That is about average for
the sector and is likely to limit any upside in the shares. However, bulls
will point out Sun's traditionally high investment exposure to UK equity and
property, which means the company is well placed to benefit from the
continuing recovery in those market conditions.

FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Bellwinch tops Pounds 0.5m as housing
market firms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bellwinch, the home counties housebuilder, yesterday confirmed the tentative
recovery in the housing market, reporting pre-tax profits at Pounds 544,000
for the year ended June 30, against Pounds 161,000 last time.
Turnover rose 11 per cent to Pounds 17.47m (Pounds 15.69m). Earnings per
share increased to 1.1p (0.9p), while the dividend was again passed.
The company said retained profits were being used to reduce the deficit in
the profit and loss reserves, 'bringing forward the date on which the
directors can consider a resumption of dividend payments.' The company last
paid a dividend in 1989.
Mr Ray Davies, deputy chairman and chief executive, said he expected house
price inflation of about 3 per cent this year.

FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Glaxo feels growing pressure on top-selling
drugs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A steady improvement in profits at Glaxo, Europe's largest pharmaceuticals
company, yesterday threatened to be overshadowed by growing market pressure
on some of its top selling drugs.
While showing a 10 per cent increase in full-year profits, the UK group
admitted that at constant exchange rates its performance had been held back
by slowing sales growth from products such as Zofran - used to treat nausea
in patients undergoing chemotherapy - and Ventolin, its long-established
anti-asthma drug.
Even Zantac, the world's best-selling drug, failed to keep pace with growth
in the anti-ulcer market of 11 per cent in the year to June 30.
Sir Richard Sykes, chief executive, said a number of drugs were facing
challenges from cheaper generic rivals, while pricing pressures had also
seen the group lose sales in some important markets, including Germany,
France and Japan.
'We have seen slower growth rates and some markets will continue to be
difficult,' he warned. 'But things are still moving in the right direction
and we will continue to support our best-sellers.'
Of those top products, Zantac continued to dominate - - accounting for 43
per cent of total turnover - and Sir Richard predicted further progress if
approval was secured for over-the-counter sales.
The group's overall market position would also be strengthened by the
success of its five fastest growing products. While only accounting for 10
per cent of total turnover last year, these products enjoyed average sales
growth of 161 per cent.
That improvement was led by Imigran, its migraine treatment, which doubled
sales to Pounds 243m. And, although revenues were adversely affected by
government healthcare reforms in some European countries, Glaxo's overall
rise in turnover exceeded market growth.
Meanwhile, costs were cut over the year as spending on marketing and
administration fell from 36.4 per cent to 34.8 per cent as a proportion of
turnover.

FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Plantsbrook advances 8% despite fall in
death rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plantsbrook, the funerals group which is subject to a Pounds 193m takeover
bid by Service Corporation International of the US, yesterday reported an 8
per cent rise in interim profits.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 5.96m to Pounds 6.44m in the six months to
June 30 while a Pounds 845,000 contribution from acquisitions lifted
turnover from Pounds 26.3m to Pounds 27.1m.
Mr Peter Hindley, chief executive, said the sales increase was achieved
despite a 2 per cent reduction in the death rate over the comparable period
last year. He said the fall was expected following the unusually high rise
in the death rate last year.
Fully diluted earnings per share rose from 3.83p to 4.11p. An interim
dividend will not be paid following the directors' decision to recommend
SCI's offer.
The company ended the period with net cash of Pounds 488,000, against Pounds
995,000. The interest charge fell from Pounds 460,000 to Pounds 292,000.
Mr Hindley said Plantsbrook had taken advantage of opportunities in the
property market and extended its branch network.
Its geographical base was extended with the acquisition of a business in
York in January and a further 15 branches were added to its Scottish network
with the purchase of DB Henry in February and Potts in Glasgow in June. Four
more branches were opened.
SCI, the largest funeral operator in the US, has also established itself as
the biggest UK operator, securing 15 per cent of the market through its
purchase of both Plantsbrook and its only listed competitor, Great Southern
Group.
SCI is paying 175p a share for the 46.3 per cent stake held by Plantsbrook's
largest shareholder, Pompes Funebres Generales, the French funerals group.
The board of Plantsbrook has recommended the offer to shareholders.

FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Market shows relief over Enterprise Oil
results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Enterprise Oil rose 13p yesterday to 400p, revealing the market's
relief over slightly better-than-expected interim results in spite of record
lows in the oil price.
A 17 per cent reduction in operating costs, lower exploration expenses and
higher production all helped to offset the effects of an 18 per cent fall in
average oil prices to Pounds 10.10. Operating profits were 4 per cent higher
at Pounds 68.4m on turnover 3 per cent ahead to Pounds 299m.
Net profits fell from Pounds 80.6m to Pounds 8.5m. This sharp fall was due
to the Pounds 24m costs of the failed bid for Lasmo, interest costs of
Pounds 15m (gains of Pounds 5.2m), and the absence of a Pounds 27m tax
credit. Last year, the government abolished relief on exploration and
appraisal costs which has resulted in higher tax charges this year. The
Pounds 24m deficit form the bid covered printing costs, lawyers' fees and
due diligence costs.
Elf Enterprise, the joint venture with Elf Aquitaine, incurred losses of
Pounds 2.2m, against gains of Pounds 9.2m last time.
Enterprise increased its production by 25 per cent to 196,450 barrels of oil
equivalent per day.
The dividend was maintained at 6.5p. Earnings fell from 15.8p to 0.1p per
share. However, cash flow per share - which is often considered a more
appropriate measure for valuing oil companies - was 33p.

FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Charges mask improved performance at
Cookson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Exceptional charges totalling Pounds 49.4m, including goodwill write-offs of
Pounds 36.5m, masked strong underlying sales growth and a sharply improved
first-half profit performance at Cookson, the specialist industrial
materials group.
Pre-tax profits after the exceptional items, which mainly related to the
sale of 25 engineering subsidiaries to a management buy-out team in March,
fell to Pounds 3.6m. The restated figure of Pounds 42.4m for the year-ago
period included a Pounds 5.5m net profit on disposals.
Excluding the exceptional items, pre-tax profits in the six months to June
30 jumped by 46 per cent to Pounds 53.8m (Pounds 36.9m), on turnover up 8
per cent to 769.1m (Pounds 710.1m).
On a like-for-like basis, after adjusting for exchange rate movements and
acquisitions and disposals, turnover grew by 12 per cent. Net interest costs
fell from Pounds 12.9m to Pounds 9.7m.
On an non-adjusted basis the group posted a 2.4p loss per share (5.6p
earnings). However, the interim dividend is raised to 3.2p (3p).
The figures, particularly the sales growth, were ahead of market
expectations and the shares closed up 7p at 259p.
Operating profits increased by 28 per cent to Pounds 63.5m (Pounds 49.8m),
or by 31 per cent on a like-for-like basis.
Mr Richard Oster, chief executive, said despite pressure on group margins
the return on sales rose from 7 per cent to 8.3 per cent - edging closer to
the target of more than 10 per cent.
Mr Oster said trading in the electronic materials and plastics businesses
was particularly strong. Most of the businesses in the ceramics and
engineered products divisions also contributed to the 'substantially
improved half-year results.'
Net borrowings at June 30 stood at Pounds 163m, representing gearing of 27
per cent.
COMMENT
Cookson is continuing to make progress towards its strategic goals. The sale
of the engineering businesses concluded the short-term divestiture programme
of non-core businesses, margins are increasing and all of the 23 loss-makers
of two years ago have been turned around. The underlying sales growth now
being achieved is impressive, prompting some analysts to raise their
forecast yesterday. Pre-tax profits, excluding exceptionals, of at least
Pounds 115m now look possible this year. Cookson is more than just a
recovery play and deserves its premium prospective p/e rating of 18.6.

FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Coke survives the Sainsbury challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of Coca-Cola in J Sainsbury stores fell 15 per cent in the first half
after the UK's largest supermarket chain launched its own brand of cola,
according to Coca-Cola &amp; Schweppes Beverages, the Coke bottler, writes
Roderick Oram.
But overall sales to Sainsbury by CCSB, a joint venture between Cadbury
Schweppes and Coca-Cola, were up 4 per cent in the first half thanks to
higher sales of non-cola soft drinks, Mr Derek Williams, head of CCSB, said
yesterday.
Sainsbury, which had a weak position in the own-label cola market, unveiled
its Classic Cola in late April to try to capture sales from branded colas.
'We've responded successfully to that challenge,' said Mr David Wellings,
Cadbury's chief executive. 'Own label is not a new or terrifying phenomenon
for us.' With Sainsbury's cola, 'we are talking only one product and one
customer'.
Only some 4 per cent of Coke's sales are to Sainsbury. Overall, Coke's UK
sales volume will rise by about 8.5 per cent this year, Mr Williams said.
Sainsbury said bottles of Classic Cola now accounted for about 65 per cent
of the chain's bottled cola sales against 25 per cent before the launch.
Cans accounted for about 55 per cent of can sales gainst 3 per cent.

FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Cadbury up 23% to Pounds 166.2m - Good
summer weather across Europe boosted soft drink sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Higher volumes of soft drink and sweet sales helped Cadbury Schweppes lift
its interim pre-tax profits by 23.2 per cent from Pounds 166.2m to Pounds
204.8m.
The UK was a strong market for both sides of its business and the US showed
a sharp increase in soft drinks. But some continental Europe markets and and
Australia suffered from local problems.
Mr Dominic Cadbury, chairman, said the second half was off to a strong start
with good summer weather across Europe boosting soft drink sales.
The interim dividend rises 27.8 per cent to 4.6p (3.6p) to reflect earnings
growth and a re-balancing of interim and final payouts. Earnings per share
were 13.42p (12.21p).
Cadbury's trading margin widened to 12.1 per cent from 10 per cent thanks to
cost savings as well as higher sales volume. Trading profits rose 25 per
cent to Pounds 213.9m (Pounds 171.1m) on sales ahead 3.5 per cent at Pounds
1.77bn (Pounds 1.71bn) in the six months to June 18.
Soft drinks in the UK were one of Cadbury's best performers despite a 6 per
cent fall in prices due to stiff competition from own-label brands such as
J. Sainsbury's Classic Cola.
Coca-Cola &amp; Schweppes Beverages, its joint venture with Coca-Cola, raised
volumes by 2 per cent and trading profits by 20 per cent, thanks in part to
further cost savings.
The division, which includes other business such as Sodastream, had trading
profits of Pounds 51.6m, up 12.7 per cent, on sales down 3.7 per cent at
Pounds 351.7m
In confectionery, UK trading profits rose by a quarter to Pounds 41.5m on
sales ahead 8.4 per cent at Pounds 387.9m. Chocolate sales volume gained 4
per cent in line with the market, Trebor Bassett's sugar sweets increased
their market share while the Maynard brand became market leader in fruit
sweets.
COMMENT
Once again Cadbury Schweppes has showned its talent for pushing its brands
in trying conditions and developing new markets. On present form before
another Spanish restructuring charge of about Pounds 25m it can produce
pre-tax profits of about Pounds 500m for the full year, or 34p a share, for
a prospective multiple of 13.5. But there are adverse factors to keep an eye
on. In the UK soft drinks market, a combination of falling prices, stagnant
revenues and ultimately finite cost-cutting measures will make it difficult
for the company to push profits higher in coming years. Much more work is
needed in order to pull continental European soft drinks together. Until
these problems are solved, the shares are fairly rated.

FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Lack of exceptionals cuts Sema to Pounds
13m at midway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sema Group, the Anglo-French computing services company, yesterday reported
a strong underlying increase in first-half profits, although the absence of
exceptional gains on disposals meant pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 15.2m
to Pounds 12.6m.
Excluding disposals, pre-tax profits on ordinary activities increased by 34
per cent to Pounds 14.2m in the six months to June 30, up from Pounds 10.6m.
There were losses this time of Pounds 1.64m from the disposal of I-Linie,
the German software products business, to IBM, compared with profits of
Pounds 4.63m.
Earnings per share slipped from 10.46p to 9.13p, but adjusting for disposals
they rose from 7.05p to 8.79p. An interim dividend of 1.6p (1.2p) has been
declared.
About 40 per cent of the equity is held by Paribas and France Telecom, while
Cap Gemini Sogeti, a rival computer services group, has 27.7 per cent.
Group turnover grew by 28 per cent to Pounds 298m (Pounds 233m), underpinned
by strong organic growth in the UK for the second successive year and by
more modest growth in France.
The latest results also include a full six months contribution from the
Swedish facilities management, information services, consulting and systems
integration businesses of the state-owned SKDforetagen group which were
acquired in October.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Kmart to close 110 US discount stores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kmart, the embattled US retailing giant, is to close 110 of its discount
stores with the loss of 6,000 jobs. It is also to reduce its management
workforce by 10 per cent during the next two years, resulting in a further
1650 job losses.
The closures are part of a retrenchment programme announced in January this
year, when Kmart took a Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 830m) restructuring charge
against 1993 earnings. Kmart said yesterday that the programme, is now 65
per cent complete. The group's profits have fallen for seven quarters in a
row, chiefly because of weak trading in the discount store business.
Yesterday's announcement was seen by Wall Street as evidence that Kmart is
concentrating on problems in its basic business. In June, Kmart agreed to
float off four of its five specialty chains after a public shareholder
revolt.
Kmart, which has been overtaken as the world's biggest retailer by its
younger US rival Wal-Mart, said the stores to be closed had not met
requirements on sales, profits or investment returns. The 110 closures
represent slightly less than 5 per cent of a total 2,350 stores in the Kmart
chain.
Mr Joseph Antonini, Kmart president, said yesterday's announcements, and the
impending flotations of the specialty store chains, represented 'strong
steps towards focusing on the core US Kmart business'. However, he added,
'much remains to be done.' Kmart shares closed up Dollars 1/2 at Dollars 18.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Margin pressures hit BTR shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BTR shares plunged nearly 12 per cent, from 382p to 338p, after the UK-based
industrial conglomerate confirmed market fears that manufacturers are
finding it difficult to pass on higher raw material prices to their
customers.
BTR said that as economic recovery had gathered pace in certain key markets,
notably North America and Australasia, it was beginning to see the twin
benefits of economic growth and increased confidence.
But it warned: 'Notwithstanding the improved orders and sales position,
overcapacities in many of the group's markets, together with raw material
cost increases, are giving rise to pricing pressures which will continue to
make the improvement of margins difficult to obtain in 1994.'
Pre-tax profits increased by 16 per cent to Pounds 694m in the six months to
June 30, while sales increased by 11 per cent to Pounds 4.5bn. Excluding
gains on disposals, pre-tax profits rose by 12 per cent, from Pounds 549m to
Pounds 616m - well below market expectations, which had been about Pounds
665m. Operating profits rose by 7.5 per cent to Pounds 684m, but margins
slipped from 15.7 to 15.2 per cent.
Analysts said BTR was a barometer stock. If a group with such strong market
positions was suffering margin pressure, then it boded badly for many
manufacturers. One said: 'We must see an increase in output costs for
companies to make money.'
However, Mr Bob Faircloth, BTR's chief operating officer, said margins had
actually increased in businesses accounting for about 70 per cent of group
sales. The margin erosion came because of specific situations in the US and
some business in continental Europe, which had still to benefit from
recovery.
Mr Alan Jackson, chief executive, said that although he saw little scope for
margin improvement in the second half, he remained confident that the group
would make further progress next year.
Gearing fell from 63 per cent to 43 per cent. Mr Jackson said 'we've got our
eye out for a large acquisition', but BTR was not yet close to a specific
deal.
The interim pay-out is a foreign income dividend (Fid) of 6.5p, compared
with last time's conventional dividend of 4.95p. For non-taxpayers, this
represents a 5 per cent increase, and a rise of 30 per cent for taxpayers.
Earnings per share rose by 9.5 per cent to 11.5p (10.5p).
Productivity and efficiency savings added Pounds 37m to operating profit,
offset by Pounds 18m of redundancy and rationalisation costs.
The group also announced a 'very significant' clutch of appointments to its
main board.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Losses on bonds fail to check Glaxo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glaxo, Europe's largest pharmaceuticals group, yesterday reported a 10 per
cent rise in profits despite making sizeable losses on investments in the
year to June 30.
Although pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 1.66bn to Pounds 1.84bn, the
shares fell 7p to 609p after the group said it lost Pounds 115m on its bond
portfolio and would incur a further Pounds 16m loss this year.
It has since liquidated the Pounds 1.7bn portfolio managed by its
Bermuda-based investment group and reinvested the funds in bank deposits and
gilts.
Increased trading profits and advantageous exchange rates, however,
persuaded the board to announce an 18p dividend, raising the final by 23 per
cent to 27p (22p).
Sharply increased US sales - dominated by Zantac, its world-leading
anti-ulcer drug - helped lift trading profits by 19 per cent to Pounds
1.81bn (Pounds 1.53bn), and underpinned a 15 per cent increase in sales from
Pounds 4.93bn to Pounds 5.65bn.
The figures were on the low side of analysts' expectations, which had ranged
from Pounds 1.88bn to Pounds 1.94bn at the pre-tax level.
Sir Richard Sykes, chief executive, admitted that the group had encountered
difficulties in a number of European countries, where sales had been hit by
government health reforms, but said that overall it was a 'tremendous'
performance.
The group enjoyed sharpest growth in the US where sales grew 15 per cent to
Pounds 2.46bn at constant exchange rates. Sir Richard said those sales could
be enhanced further if the group wins approval for over-the-counter sales on
Zantac, which it plans to seek next month.
He also said the group had improved cost efficiency by shedding jobs in
Germany, Italy and Canada and had slowed the rate of growth on research and
development and capital expenditure. Those measures helped increase net
liquid funds from Pounds 1.82bn to Pounds 2.22bn.
'It's important for Glaxo to have a cash pile,' said Sir Richard. 'I did say
we would make a move in the US by year-end, but having evaluated the
situation, we did not think it was in the interests of the company or the
shareholders.' Earnings per share rose 8 per cent from 39.9p to 42.9p, while
earnings per American Depository Receipt were unchanged at Dollars 1.29.

FT  09 SEP 94 / BBL backs Rudloff's new bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Hans-Jorg Rudloff, who pioneered the Euromarkets as head of Credit Suisse
First Boston in London, is to return to investment banking with the backing
of Belgium's Banque Bruxelles Lambert.
BBL announced yesterday that it was taking a 29 per cent stake in the new
venture, which has paid-in capital of Dollars 75m (Pounds 48m).
Mr Rudloff and his partner Mr Peter Ogden are the main shareholders and will
manage the business. Mr Ogden was a managing director at Morgan Stanley.
Other investors were not named, nor was the investment bank itself, which Mr
Rudloff said yesterday went internally under the name of 'The Institution.'
The shareholders plan to register the company by November with the intention
of beginning operations by January.
Mr Rudloff said his latest undertaking would offer advice on innovative
financing, mergers and acquisitions, and provide other traditional
investment banking services.
The Institution would focus on western Europe where Mr Rudloff believes he
has many relationships as governments and banks withdraw from companies
across the region.
Other favourites of the former CSFB head are the emerging markets of the
Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary.
'I know the area very well,' said Mr Rudloff, who masterminded CSFB's
controversial but ultimately successful drive into eastern Europe. Mr
Rudloff's background has focused much attention on his next move and he was
anxious to deflate expectations of the scope of his project.
'I am a little bit worried that people expect us to act right away like a
big firm, and that is not the case,' he said. 'There is no comparison with
the bulge bracket firms (one of the dominant US investment houses).'
Mr Rudloff headed CSFB in London for over a decade before being moved in
1993 amid internal disputes to the executive board of CS Holding, the
Swiss-based holding company of the Credit Suisse group.
Observers never thought him suited to the role of strategic planner to which
he was moved, and he left CS Holding in February this year.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Lasmo bid cost Enterprise Pounds 24m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Enterprise Oil continues to pay the cost of its failed bid for rival
explorer Lasmo with the disclosure yesterday it was writing down by Pounds
18m the shares it controversially acquired in the final days of battle.
Total costs of the Pounds 1.6bn all-share bid came to nearly Pounds 24m,
including Pounds 5.7m in fees paid to the company's numerous advisers. Lasmo
is expected to report charges of about Pounds 25m when it announces interim
results next week.
The costs helped to depress Enterprise's interim net profits from Pounds
80.1m to Pounds 8.5m. The return was also hit by low oil prices, changes to
the North Sea tax regime and a Pounds 20m swing in interest to payments of
Pounds 15m. Excluding Lasmo-related provisions, profits after tax were
Pounds 32.3m.
Enterprise has written its 9.8 per cent stake down to Pounds 142m, valuing
the shares at 150p. This compares with an average 169p paid by Enterprise
just two days before the bid closed, and yesterday's close of 159p, up 2 1/2
p. The purchase, largely from one investor, angered some shareholders who
claimed thay had not been given the chance to sell.
Mr Andrew Shilston, finance director, said Enterprise intended to keep the
shares as an investment for the immediate future. The 150p share price was a
'conservative view of what the long-term value of the shares would be', he
said.
Enterprise's failed bid and the resultant costs have put pressure on the
group to come up with a strategy for replacing reserves because production
from its successful Nelson and Scott fields is expected to peak over the
next two to three years.
'By the end of the year we will expect a clear statement on where Enterprise
thinks it is going,' said one investor. 'As they stand, they are effectively
liquidating themselves.'
Mr Shilston said the company was not worried about its post-Lasmo future.
'Our basic approach is the same now as it would have been with Lasmo,' he
said. Enterprise would continue to exploit opportunities such as farm-ins
and asset swaps. The first move into South America is expected within the
next six months.
In areas such as Norway and the Black Sea, he said, 'We can make a meal of
prospects that probably lie below the horizon for companies such as Esso'.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Big C&amp;G rise fuels doubts of bid critics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the sixth largest building society, yesterday
reported a 44.5 per cent increase in first half pre-tax profits, from Pounds
75.3m to Pounds 108.8m.
The percentage increase is among the higher rises reported by UK mortgage
lenders, and has underlined concerns expressed by some C&amp;G members that
Lloyds Bank's Pounds 1.8bn cash takeover bid for the society may not be a
full price.
The profit rise came despite a decline in operating margins over the past
year. C&amp;G warned that pressure on margins could be expected to continue
through the rest of the year.
The increase reflected both a drop in provisions for bad and doubtful debts
and an aggressive approach to the mortgage market which saw lending rise by
almost 30 per cent to Pounds 1.48bn. Loss provisions fell by 63 per cent
from Pounds 63.6m to Pounds 23.5m, while net interest receivable rose by
less than 1.5 per cent to Pounds 169.3m, even though business volume was
markedly higher.
The proportion of C&amp;G's funding which is drawn from the wholesale money
markets rather than retail deposits was somewhat higher at the half-year
than the 22.8 per cent it represented at the 1993 year-end.
Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive, said C&amp;G had concentrated on trying to
win a larger share of mortgage business. But the impact of competition,
which had led it to stop charging valuation or application fees, had
translated into a drop in other income and charges from Pounds 29.9m to
Pounds 25.2m and contributed to a rise in management expenses from Pounds
49.1m to Pounds 58.0m.
The increase in administrative costs - which took costs as a percentage of
income to 29.8 from 26.4 per cent at the end of 1994 - also reflected the
cost of running the extra 20 branches and Pounds 1bn mortgage book acquired
in the takeover of Heart of England Building Society.
C&amp;G also paid Pounds 4.2m expenses - a combination of fees to advisers and
costs of mailing information to its 1.4m members - relating to its proposed
acquisition by Lloyds. Further costs will come through in the second half of
the year, reflecting work on computer systems for the voting procedures by
which the members must approve the deal.
Mr Paul Rivlin, one of the organisers of the C&amp;G Alternatives Group, said
the results reinforced the view that the society's business was very robust.
'If anything, these results strengthen the concern that Pounds 1.8bn is not
a very good deal,' Mr Rivlin said. His group wants C&amp;G's board to explain
more fully the rationale for accepting the Lloyds bid rather than adopting
any other course.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Milk row may force Tesco to buy from Continent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tesco, the UK supermarket chain, yesterday threatened to source a
significant proportion of the company's dairy products from the Continent if
the government does not change plans for opening up the Pounds 3.3bn British
milk market that are leading to large increases in price.
The threat, made by Tesco's trading director Mr John Gildersleeve, came as
Mr William Waldegrave, the agriculture minister, rejected calls from the
Dairy Trade Federation for a referral of the planned milk market to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The Dairy Trade Federation, which represents British dairy companies, will
apply for a judicial review of the milk market liberalisation on Monday.
Mr Chris Haskins, chairman of Northern Foods, one of the UK's largest dairy
groups, said he was disappointed at Mr Waldegrave's decision. Northern
claims market changes could wipe Pounds 15m off its profits this year.
Avonmore Foods, the Irish dairy group, made a profits warning yesterday and
Unigate has also told the City to expect its results to be affected.
Mr Gildersleeve called the deregulation plans 'a retrograde step of the
worst order, which is inflationary and leading to price increases of 20 per
cent'. He was speaking at the launch of Tesco's Best of British promotion,
aimed at encouraging shoppers to buy home-produced goods.
The Milk Marketing Board, the government's statutory purchaser of milk in
England and Wales, is due to be abolished at the beginning of November when
the market is liberalised. It will be replaced by Milk Marque, a voluntary
farmers' co-operative, which has already signed up 65 per cent of supplies.
Milk Marque's price auction for allocating supplies to dairies has led to a
jump in price of between 10 per cent and 18 per cent for different types of
buyers.
Mr Gildersleeve said he would have no choice but to buy products from
outside the UK, which would reverse much of the government's efforts of
recent years in encouraging supermarkets to buy British in a bid to reduce
the Pounds 5.6bn food and drink trade gap.
Tesco used to buy fromage frais from France, but in the past couple of years
had turned to British suppliers, Mr Gildersleeve said. But if there is to be
a 20 per cent price increase he said he would be forced to go back to buying
from the Continent.
Mr Jim McMichael-Phillips, DTF president, said imports would flood into the
new market. 'For Milk Marque to suggest that its pricing strategy will
provide the industry with security and stability in the open market is
totally irresponsible,' he said.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Banks set derivatives disclosure guidelines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International banks yesterday responded to growing pressure for better
information about the risks they run by using financial derivatives by
suggesting new standards for disclosure.
The Institute of International Finance, an association of 180 international
banks and securities firms, published a set of guidelines for disclosure in
annual reports.
Mr Charles Dallara, the institute's managing director, said that greater
transparency would be 'in everyone's interest'.
The guidelines were drawn up by a working group including most of the
leading firms selling over-the-counter derivatives - contracts sold by banks
to companies to help them control the risk of movements in currency and
interest rates.
The institute said there was no adequate method of quantifying the risks
banks run from market movements leading to falls in the value of derivatives
such as swaps and options, and recommended instead that banks provide a
description of risk management methods.
Concern that banks do not make detailed enough disclosures about derivatives
has grown because of losses by companies such as Procter &amp; Gamble. As the
contacts derive from the value of other securities and indexes, they do not
appear on balance sheets.
This has led to legislative pressure in the US for improved disclosure, and
tighter regulation of securities firms' derivatives trading units. Although
banks and securities firms in the EU and US are required by accounting rules
to disclose information on derivatives, if the guidelines were adopted by
all banks it would give a clearer picture of the global market.
Ms Barbara Matthews, an associate banking adviser of the institute, said
banks had pressed for guidelines in order to establish the size of the
market. There was no requirement for members to follow them, but several had
indicated they would.
The working group suggested that banks and securities firms should disclose
three things:
The total replacement value of contracts - the amount they would have to
spend to buy new derivatives contracts if companies defaulted on existing
ones. This would be divided into contracts with companies of various credit
ratings.
The value of contracts in each category of derivatives, such as currency
swaps and interest rate options, and a breakdown of maturity profiles, or
the length of time contracts have to run before expiry.
Analysis of their methods of accounting, risk management, netting of
contracts, and limits on trading. They would also have to describe
management controls, an aspect of risk management which many supervisors
have highlighted.
Ms Matthews said that although many banks and securities firms complied with
individual aspects of the new guidelines, none yet complied with them all.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Falling trade deficit eases fears of early rate rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes grew yesterday that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, would hold back
from an early rise in interest rates. A marked narrowing in Britain's
visible trade deficit in June and an apparent slowdown in retail sales last
month pointed to continued non-inflationary growth.
The Central Statistical Office reported a lower-than-expected deficit of
Pounds 690m on Britain's trade with the rest of the world in June, while the
Confederation of British Industry's distributive trades survey suggested
that retail sales in August were only slightly up on a year ago.
Together with recent indications of slower monetary growth and credit
demand, yesterday's economic news reinforced the impression that last year's
two tax-raising Budgets have rebalanced the economy so that growth is now
based more on exports and investment than consumption. If so, the UK
recovery, now more than two years old, could be entering a more mature phase
without threatening to push inflation higher or trigger a balance of
payments crisis.
While the trade figures had little impact on financial markets, the CBI
survey prompted prices of government gilt-edged stock to move higher as the
City reasoned that a rise in bank base rates from 5.25 per cent was less
likely.
'This survey should effectively put the kibosh on speculation of an imminent
rate hike,' said Mr Don Smith, an economist with Midland Global Markets.
His hopes were echoed by Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, speaking at
the annual dinner of the Scottish CBI in Glasgow last night. 'We needed a
recovery based more on production, investment and exports than on
consumption. So a modest slowdown on the high street is no cause for alarm,'
Mr Davies said. 'Indeed, I hope the main effect is to persuade Eddie George
(the governor of the Bank of England) to hold off his interest rate rise for
some time yet.'
Mr Davies also took a swipe at MPs who wanted to undermine the government's
programme to reduce the budget deficit through tax cuts 'for short-term
political reasons'. Pressure for such tax cuts 'has to be resisted', he
said.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, told the Scottish
CBI that Britain now had 'one of the most favourable combinations of
economic circumstances' for 40 years and the government was determined to
keep it that way. He warned of tough public spending decisions ahead and
urged industry to keep wage costs firmly under control.
According to Mr Michael Saunders, economist at Salomon Brothers in London,
Britain's mix of low pound, ample spare capacity and tight fiscal policy 'is
pretty close to the text book recipe for a country with a persistent balance
of payments deficit, and it seems to be working'.

Judging by yesterday's second-quarter growth figures, the German bond market
had no reason to push bond yields above 7.5 per cent this week. West German
growth, which reached 2.3 per cent in the second quarter, is heavily
propelled by construction, exports and stock-building. There is little sign
of an inflationary boom in private consumption. Next year's tax increases
could prevent that occurring for some time, and if there is not enough
demand to absorb the higher level of stocks, the recovery could even falter
in the second half. There is little incentive for the Bundesbank to start
raising interest rates again in the near term, and recent comments from top
officials seem designed to discourage such speculation.
But there are other reasons why the bond market may not recover its
composure that easily. The first is the perennial problem of supply, with
another auction of government bonds due this month. The second is election
uncertainty. An SPD victory would raise fresh doubts about Bonn's ability to
curb the budget and might also raise expectations for next year's wage
round. In those circumstances the Bundesbank might find it harder to ignore
the fact that, although M3 money supply growth is decelerating, it is still
way above its target range.

FT  09 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: British Gas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Most of the big questions surrounding British Gas were left unanswered at
yesterday's interim results. The company has deferred until the end of the
month a full public presentation of dividend policy, international strategy
and plans for its domestic business. Even so, those clues that did emerge
were positive. Most obviously, by maintaining its dividend at the half-year
the company seemingly signalled that it would not carry out earlier threats
to cut the payout. A modest increase or, at worst, a frozen dividend for the
whole year now looks likely.
British Gas is also, after a late start, moving smartly to cut costs in its
UK gas supply business. The first 3,000 out of the planned 25,000 job cuts
went in the half year. Moreover, the company emphasised yesterday its more
constructive approach towards its regulator's plans to abolish its domestic
monopoly. That should reassure investors that management will focus on
putting the business into shape rather than wasting energy on unproductive
squabbles with its regulator.
No clues, though, were given about Gas's future international strategy.
Following the sale of Consumers Gas and Bow Valley Energy, the group's
debt-to-equity ratio has fallen to 24 per cent. The low gearing level gives
Gas scope to make further investments overseas. But the company needs first
to articulate a credible strategy. Otherwise, it would do better to follow
the electricity companies and buy back its shares.

FT  09 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Glaxo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Glaxo obviously disappointed with its losses in the bond market, but the
deceleration in sales growth is a longer-term worry. Growth in sales
volumes, excluding currencies, declined from 13 per cent in the first half
to 9 per cent during the second six months. Four out of five of the group's
top products recorded lower growth rates.
The deceleration is likely to continue. The most serious problem is Zantac,
which continues to account for 43 per cent of sales. Zantac's growth rate
actually improved in the second half, but such increases are clearly
unsustainable. Competitors such as Astra's Losec are gobbling market share.
In the US, generic versions of Tagamet - which did not have time to hit
sales last financial year - are set to make their mark during the current 12
months. Most ominous is the continuing danger of direct US generic
competition to Zantac by 1996.
Once promising new products will not adequately compensate when Zantac sales
start to decline. Zofran has peaked only four years after launch. Second
half sales were below those in the first six months. Imigran and Serevent
continue to grow strongly but from a low base. There is a significant
possibility of group turnover plateauing from 1996.
None of this is the fault of Glaxo's management. It continues to excel in
the discovery, development and marketing of innovative treatments. On the
earnings side, it is helping itself by slowing increases in R&amp;D. But Glaxo
will remain weak as long as it remains so dependent on Zantac. It could
afford to get round the problem by buying another pharmaceuticals company.
There are still opportunities in the US.

FT  09 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: BTR's marginal error
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BTR hit a raw nerve with yesterday's revelation that the difficulty of
passing on cost increases had caused a drop in its first-half margins. It
would be natural to expect such a squeeze to affect other manufacturers
given the anaemic nature of the economic recovery. But one should beware of
drawing too strong a general conclusion. BTR's mix of businesses tends to
peak in mid to late cycle, so there is time for its margins to improve as an
operational gearing effect clicks in. Besides, the 12 per cent fall in its
shares yesterday reflects the way BTR has compounded its problems through
strikingly poor presentation.
BTR's studied aloofness from City institutions may be justified in the
tighter climate for disclosure and insider dealing, but companies which make
a point of disclosing nothing informally should make every effort to use
formal occasions for straight talking. BTR's annual meeting statement this
summer was a model of obfuscation. It contrived to give the impression that
margins, while affected by price pressures, were actually rising. Investors
have a right to feel indignant to find they have fallen, especially when
confronted with the lame excuse that the group margin would have risen
without the cessation of the Denver airport contract and other selected
events.
BTR will now find it difficult to dispel lingering doubts about whether
margin recovery, now presumably awaited next year, will ever occur. If it
does not and the climate really has changed, the company will have to revise
its traditional policy of being willing to sacrifice volume growth for
margin enhancement. Even another large acquisition, for which room is
emerging as gearing declines, might not then be enough to distract from
worries about organic growth.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Personal View: Poland's privatisation in a mess
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCJA SWIATKOWSKI CANNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Poland's prime minister, Waldemar Pawlak, has had on his desk for the last
two months the implementation order of the mass privatisation programme
first introduced in July 1990. The reason he has not signed it so far is the
continuing controversy and opposition to this programme among wide sections
of the Polish population. While in all other economies in transition mass
privatisation programmes have an important function of securing the
political support for economic reforms, here it has deepened conflicts and
instability.
The reasons for the controversy lie in the mistakes made at the beginning of
the economic transition in 1990. Polish privatisation law defined two
principal strategies: sales to foreign investors and initial public
offerings (IPOs) on the newly organised Warsaw stock exchange. However, by
July 1994, there were only 24 IPOs and about 60 sales to foreign investors.
This strategy is more suitable for a western country where only a few state
enterprises are to be privatised than for the Polish economy, dominated by
more than 8,000 state enterprises. As an afterthought, a provision was added
for 'liquidation' of medium-sized enterprises through employee ownership and
leases. This resulted in about 1,000 privatisations, a great success.
A question arose, however, about what to do with large enterprises which did
not qualify to be floated on the tightly regulated Warsaw stock exchange and
where there was no foreign investor interest. The answer was to place them
in groups and find foreign turnround managers who would restructure and
improve them to a point where they could be floated or where foreign
investors could be found for them. But successive governments and
consultants developed the idea in such a way as to make the programme
politically unacceptable.
The objections centre on two fundamental issues. The first relates to the
centralised and bureaucratic nature of this programme. The way it works is
that ministry officials organise 20 government investment funds, choose
foreign managers, and divide up 60 per cent of the shares of 400 companies
between them (the remaining shares belong 25 per cent to the state, and 15
per cent to the employees). Each manager is a strategic investor in about 30
of them. Thus, the government is closely identified with the whole scheme,
which raises fears of collusion, fraud and conflicts of interest.
The second and more important objection is the inadequacy of this programme
as mass privatisation. It involves only 400 companies, but attempts to
satisfy the claims of citizens whose savings were forcibly appropriated
under communist rule. The plan is to give potentially 27m adult Poles a
voucher which can be exchanged for one share in each one of 20 investment
funds, minus 15 per cent of shares reserved for their managers.
However, critics claim such a programme is among the least encompassing in
east European countries and does not satisfy popular desires for
participation and equity. In Estonian privatisation, the asset transfer per
adult averages Dollars 1,000 and participants can use their vouchers to buy
housing, land, agricultural implements, shares of state enterprises and a
pension annuity. In Czechoslovakia's first wave of privatisation, the asset
transfer was about Dollars 1,000 per voucher holder and, in the second wave,
about Dollars 800. Czechs can bid for any of more than 2,000 enterprises or
deposit vouchers with investment funds.
In contrast, Polish citizens have no choice about the use of their vouchers
or which investment fund - government or private - to deposit them with. And
the amount of asset transfer is minuscule, involving the 27m potential
voucher holders, and compensation claims of state employees and retirees.
This is ironic considering that Poland was the cradle of ideas about popular
participation in the transformation and privatisation of communist
economies. In 1981, Solidarity established the principle of autonomous,
self-financing enterprises under some social control. The 1988 voucher
coupon scheme, eventually successfully applied in Czechoslovakia, was
proposed by Polish economists. The 1990 transformation programme went
against popular expectations by defining the privatisation strategy in a
centralised and excluding manner.
Unless the successive Polish governments abandon the attitude of imposing
arbitrary programmes from above and meet reasonable demands of citizens for
equity and participation in reforms, the privatisation policy in Poland will
remain a political battleground where little gets accomplished.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Leading Article: German face-lift
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Do not forget to be surprised. Yesterday's figures, showing 2.3 per cent
annual growth in west German real gross domestic product in the second
quarter of 1994, confirm that the German economic recovery is now well under
way. Coupled with other recent data, the news has implications for the
likely course of German monetary policy in the months ahead. But the
contrast between this spritely performance and the many gloomy predictions
at the start of the year holds a further lesson: tired old Germany can still
show its European partners a thing or two.
Real pan-German GDP growth for 1994 could exceed the government's own
revised prediction of 2.5 per cent. Though Bundesbank officials have this
week been at pains to leave the door open for further interest rate cuts,
the chances of another monetary loosening appear to be shrinking. True,
monetary aggregates have been better behaved in recent months, but the
prospect of 2 or more per cent real growth in west German GDP this year
provides little obvious reason for the bank to side-step its money supply
targets once again.
That figure can justify, however, a certain amount of self-congratulation.
In December, the government was almost alone in hoping for even 1.5 per cent
real pan-German growth for 1994: the OECD, for example, expected only  3/4
per cent, with very little of that to come from the west.
What went right? Monetarists would see little mystery in recent data: excess
money growth is now feeding into demand, just as they would expect. But the
economy's ability to rebound so encouragingly owes as much to the
stability-oriented policy of the Bundesbank as it does to monetary
expansion. The bank's credibility as a guard against inflation has weathered
recent knocks better than many supposed: long-term government bond yields
are currently the lowest in Europe, at around 7 1/2 per cent.
Given consumer price inflation of about 3 per cent, real rates of 4.5 per
cent (compared with more than 6 per cent in France) may allow a return to
economic form for Germany. There is plenty still to worry about: above all,
a high rate of unemployment, so far little affected by this year's growth.
But two things are already in place: growth through exports and, as has been
true throughout most of the past few years, faster growth than seems likely
in France.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Unions today
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's Trades Union Congress has been a subdued affair. But through the
haze of rhetoric it has been possible to detect the shape of a reformed
trade union movement. Further reform may not be sufficient to ensure unions
a dynamic future. But they can still enjoy significant if lesser roles as
lobbyists for employee rights and providers of assistance to individual
members.
Re-legitimised by ballots, the unions are more representative than they have
been for decades. Thanks to the campaign to sign up members for the
automatic 'check-off' of union subscriptions, it is also possible to state
that membership is real and voluntary. Moreover, unions carry a far smaller
part of the blame for the UK's labour market problems than they used to.
Much of the credit for this transformation belongs to successive
Conservative governments, but Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, could prove
the main beneficiary. Earlier this week, he shrewdly used the signal
workers' strike to loosen further the union hold over his party. However it
is premature to imply, as Mr Blair does, that the unions are merely a
pressure group with the same access to Labour as business. Mr Blair cannot
wriggle out of union-inspired policy commitments - such as a national
minimum wage. And at a private dinner on Tuesday he assured union leaders
that he still needs them to win an election.
Nevertheless, both Mr Blair and Mr John Monks, general secretary of the TUC,
do share a sensible vision of modest, non-partisan trade unionism,
supporting individual employees in a rapidly changing labour market and
providing a voice for employee-stakeholders in larger organisations and an
expert view on employment and training at national level. That view may
prove more popular than the dismissive attitudes of Conservative ministers.
This is not enough, however, to ensure unions a healthy future. There are
signs - from Mr Monks's relaunch of the TUC to union use of shareholder
forums to lobby for employee interests - that unions are becoming more
effective. But collective bargaining and union membership are likely to
continue to decline, albeit at a slower pace than in the recent past. Such a
decline would not necessarily be stemmed by worker-friendly European
legislation, based on employee not union rights, or by the election of a
Labour government. But unions are not ends in themselves. What is needed is
a balanced framework of employment law.
Contrary to much union rhetoric, employees are not without rights at the
workplace, but that framework does need clarification. A clearer right to
union representation in individual grievance cases, which Mr Blair would
introduce, is a case in point. It would also offer unions a new role in
providing professional and legal support to individuals. If they are to
thrive, these are the opportunities they must seize.

What's with the British trade union movement? Aside from the discourse on
the signal workers' strike and a brief self-parody from miners' leader
Arthur Scargill, this year's congress must have been the mildest on record.
It seems to have coincided with an almost complete absence of Liverpudlians
in Blackpool - and hence a paucity of those militant pronouncements that so
often seem to be delivered with a Scouse inflection.
And now the next TUC president, the general secretary of the Banking
Insurance and Finance Union, is an alumnus of Balliol College, Oxford, for
heaven's sake. Leif Mills was to be heard yesterday congratulating himself
on having attained 'the last unclimbed peak of British life for the
college'. At least his accent is decidedly on the prole side of cut glass.

A research company ringing to inquire about the contents of the course was

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
How terribly piquant. Edith Cresson, France's commissioner-in-waiting,
presented herself in Brussels yesterday for a discreet tete a tete with
Jacques Delors, the outgoing EU president, and the man who for a while
seemed tempted to become prime minister of France following Cresson's own
short stab at the job.
She certainly needs all the hot tips she can get. A big-ticket portfolio
such as external trade or competition policy is what she really covets, but
the present incumbents - Sir Leon Brittan, the senior UK commissioner, and
Karel Van Miert, the Belgian commissioner - look pretty tough to dislodge.
That might mean she is best off aiming for the industry portfolio - where
she could after all amuse herself crafting a whole new European industrial
policy for the 1990s.
The snag there is Martin Bangemann, the senior German industry commissioner,
who could get in the way.
He seems fairly certain to stay on in the next regime, and apparently has
his eyes on a new information technology portfolio which would encompass
both telecommun-ications and computers.
If Bangemann succeeded with that particular master plan, Cresson would risk
being stuck with the smokestack industries.
Much depends, then, on the attitude of Jacques Santer, the prime minister of
Luxembourg who takes over from Delors next January.
The genial Santer is known in the Grand Duchy as the man who never says No.
So perhaps he is a relatively soft target for the legendary Cresson charm.

Barclayshare Overseas Service, it proudly announces that facilities for
dealing on the London Stock Exchange will be available to overseas nationals
as well as to 'expatriots'.
So what form of proof does Barclays require from potential customers that
they have abandoned their wicked ways?

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Forget Future Large Aircraft and Apache helicopters. The real interest of
this week's Farnborough Air Show existed in an especially vigorous exchange
of words between Boeing, the world's biggest civil aircraft maker, and its
European rival, Airbus.
Ron Woodard, boss of Boeing's commercial aircraft operations, was patently
riled by Airbus claims that its aircraft order book for the first half of
1994 was actually fatter than that of the Seattle giant.
So Woodard laid into Adam Brown, Airbus's strategic planning director,
himself a virtuoso speaker who has long had a good line in digs at Boeing's
expense. Whenever Brown spoke, Woodard attested, you could see his nose
growing longer and longer.
Brown himself was in two minds as to the merits of being esteemed the
Pinocchio of the industry. Was Boeing finally conceding that the European
consortium had a better nose for business? Or did it just mean that Woodard
still didn't believe a word that Airbus's nasal attache said?

FT  09 SEP 94 / Ploughed back into swords: Peace deals will not stop
military spending rising in the Middle East
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE and ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even as King Hussein of Jordan was shaking hands with Israeli prime minister
Yitzhak Rabin on the White House lawn on July 25,US military officials were
busy preparing a package of arms deliveries to assist in the modernisation
of Jordan's armed forces.
The US pledge to upgrade Jordan's military, coupled with Washington's
promises to forgive up to Dollars 700m of the Dollars 950m debt owed to it
by Jordan, were important incentives for the King to make peace with Israel.
However incongruous it may seem, the unfolding Middle East peace is likely
to increase, not decrease, arms-related spending in the region. Continuing
hostility between governments, fuelled by political ambitions, border
conflicts and the challenge of Islamic fundamentalism, means that regional
military expenditure as a proportion of gross national product is likely to
remain above 20 per cent for the foreseeable future. Most Gulf states are
already running budget deficits.
Since Israel's peace breakthrough with the Palestinians last summer, some
Israeli officials have argued that one of the most important economic
dividends would be the re-allocation of billions of dollars spent on the
military forces of the Middle East. In 1991 alone, the region is estimated
to have allocated Dollars 88bn to military expenditure, a figure heavily
influenced by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and the subsequent Gulf
war.
Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, proudly predicted in biblical
terms that the region would soon beat swords into plowshares. He foresaw a
region of government by ballots not bullets, where the only generals would
be General Motors and General Electric.
However, the trend has so far been in the opposite direction. The Israeli
army says the redeployment of troops from occupied Palestinian territory
will place additional burdens on its defence budget for several years. The
US has already granted Israel an extra Dollars 28m, on top of its annual
military aid of Dollars 1.8bn, to meet those costs. General Ehud Barak, army
chief of staff, is seeking an extra Shk500m (Dollars 170m) for the 1995
defence budget. That would be in addition to the Shk250m in 'special'
budgetary support that has already supplemented this year's Shk20.5bn total.
Domestic military expenditure is being augmented by US military assistance,
pledged as a result of peace developments. Washington is committed to
providing military aircraft: the first deliveries of 50 F-16 fighter jets
arrived in Israel in early August. In January, Israel signed a Dollars 2bn
contract with McDonnell Douglas to buy 20 F-15-E 'Eagle' warplanes, adapted
for longer-range pre-emptive missions, night-flying capabilities and air
superiority.
A possible peace agreement in the next few months with Syria, Israel's most
militarily powerful neighbour, would not ease the burden on the Israeli
defence budget. There would be further withdrawal costs as Israel pulled out
of the Syrian land it occupies, and Israel is determined to purchase
military hardware to maintain a 'strong deterrent profile' in return for
giving up strategic land such as the Golan plateau.
'The aim is long-term investment in unique battle weapons that Arab states
cannot buy,' said Lt Col Moshe Foegel, Israeli military spokesman.
Military experts said US arms transfers to Israel, Egypt, Jordan and perhaps
later to other Arab states that make peace with Israel would require large
increases in spending on runways, maintenance, training, spare parts and
salaries. 'In the short term, peace agreements will increase, not decrease,
Israel's military expenditures,' said Professor Eliahu Konovsky of Bar-Ilan
University, near Tel Aviv.
Apart from the cost of Israel's peace treaties with Arab neighbours, there
are deeper geo-political reasons for believing the military dividend from
peace is likely to prove illusory throughout the Middle East. Military
experts in Israel say the most potent threat in the past decade has been
from Iran and Iraq, not Syria or Jordan.
Iran, though diminished as a military force since the overthrow of the Shah
in 1979 and its eight-year war with Iraq until 1988, remains ideologically
opposed to the Jewish state. Tehran has sought to rebuild its armed forces
with purchases primarily from Russia and China, and has devoted some 18 per
cent of its annual budget to the military.
However, Iran's failure to manage its economy efficiently and the steep
decline in oil prices have severely limited the regime's scope for military
development.
Iraq, while considerably weakened by the Gulf war and UN sanctions, also
remains a potential menace to its neighbours, especially to Kuwait to which
it has not renounced territorial claims.
Suggestions that Iraq might be seeking to improve relations with Iran send
shivers down Israel's spine, as do editorials in US newspapers arguing for
an easing of UN sanctions against Iraq. 'As soon as UN sanctions are lifted,
the clock will start ticking for us and for the whole region,' said Lt Col
Foegel. 'While it's true that the short-term threat of war against Israel
has decreased, there are serious long-term concerns, especially from Iran
and from Iraq, when it is allowed to start rearming.'
Israel is not alone in fearing a renewal of Iraq's expansionist dreams.
Iran, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have all suffered Iraqi troops on their soil
in the past decade. The more general threat of Islamic extremism, sponsored
by Iran, gives some countries another reason for making strategic arms
purchases and building deterrent capabilities.
Saudi Arabia, for example, which might have been vulnerable if Iraq had
continued its advance after the capture of Kuwait in 1990, had a defence
budget last year of Dollars 16.5bn - the region's highest. Since the
invasion of Kuwait, Riyadh has embarked on a big armaments programme,
ordering Dollars 30bn worth of arms from the US and UK. The latest Saudi
purchases, including the 1992 US package of 72 F-15XP fighter aircraft and
900 Maverick missiles worth Dollars 9bn, follow imports of Dollars 29.7bn
between 1987 and 1991, according to the US Arms Control and Disarmament
Agency.
Kuwait is spending at least Dollars 12bn replacing and upgrading its armed
forces, which were decimated by Iraq's occupation. Syria is believed to have
bought at least Dollars 2bn worth of aircraft, tanks and missiles from
Russia, North Korea and China since 1992. The money was mostly a grant from
Saudi Arabia (Dollars 1.5bn) and other Gulf states after Syria's
participation in the Gulf war.
Egypt, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979 and received grants
and debt cancellations worth Dollars 8bn from the US after the Gulf war, has
urged the US not to cut annual military aid of Dollars 1.3bn.
The unwillingness of many Arab countries, even those at peace with Israel,
to consider cuts in their armed forces also reflects the historical
suspicion of Israeli intentions which, despite current peace moves, remains
just below the surface. They view with concern Israel's secret nuclear
capability, its latest military purchases and its widening technological
superiority.
Prof Konovsky argues Arab states will also continue to invest heavily in
their armed forces because of regional disputes over borders and water.
Saudi Arabia has border disputes with several neighbours; Iraq still lays
claim to Kuwait; Syria and Turkey are in conflict over land and the waters
of the Euphrates river; while the UAE and the other Arab Gulf states are
seeking to reverse Iran's occupation of three small islands near the Strait
of Hormuz.
The Arab-Israel peace process remains just one element in this complex
mosaic of tensions and rivalries, and despite Mr Peres's optimism, will not
of itself promote a wider settlement of outstanding issues. For western and
Middle Eastern governments to begin to address issues such as regional arms
control, countries like Iran and Iraq will have to be drawn back into the
framework of more normal international relations.
There is, as yet, little idea of how this can be achieved, while the danger
grows that other countries, such as Algeria, could be added to the list of
governments with which the west is struggling to come to terms. And while
the arms spending continues, the diversion of limited resources to
non-productive ends can but deepen the poverty in which too much of the
Middle East is steeped, and which provides such a fertile recruiting ground
for extremists. In this vicious circle, only the arms manufacturers seem
likely to come out ahead.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Leading Article: European defence
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The French prime minister called yesterday for improved co-operation on
defence, including weapons development, between members of the European
Union. His words are given added point by last week's Dollars 10bn merger
between Lockheed and Martin Marietta - the most spectacular illustration to
date of the way that plunging military budgets are altering the structure of
the US defence industry, and a reminder that Europe's arms producers are far
behind.
The European defence sector is not dormant. British Aerospace and Matra are
still negotiating a merger of their missile activities; Aerospatiale of
France and Deutsche Aerospace have pledged to merge theirs, and possibly
also their satellite businesses, by next year.
But the continent's defence industry remains overcrowded, and every new
American merger brings closer the day when European weapons are priced out
of all markets (including European ones) by rivals from across the Atlantic.
No single European country can hope to be self-sufficient in defence
technology. Yet European governments are setting tough conditions for
transnational mergers, ostensibly to avoid compromising national secrets or
creating dependence on foreign governments. This attitude is hardly
consistent with the commitment to a common foreign and security policy, and
eventual common defence policy, enshrined in the Maastricht treaty. It
appears that the collapse of the Soviet threat, even as it renders the
economics of cross-border defence co-operation more compelling, has, by
depriving European states of a common enemy, made them more nationalistic in
their defence philosophy.
Experiences like that of Eurofighter 2000 have made governments rightly
sceptical about the value of cross-border collaborative programmes in
producing defence equipment efficiently. If a coherent and competitive
European defence industry is to come about, it must be in response to an
integrated defence market.
By co-operating over the purchase of big weapons, and throwing open their
purchase of smaller ones to the most competitive European bidder,
governments could create the circumstances under which it would be easier
for arms makers to merge. Article 223 of the Treaty of Rome, which
effectively puts military products outside the scope of the common market,
is now clearly an anachronism and should logically have been repealed when
the Maastricht treaty was adopted.
In an ideal world, indeed, this logic would apply to the Atlantic alliance
as a whole. But experience suggests that US defence industries will continue
to use arguments of national security, however spurious, to prevent the
introduction of a genuine 'two-way street' in weapons procurement across the
Atlantic.
The best Europe can hope, therefore, is to ensure that on its side such
arguments are applied to Europe as a whole, rather than at the level of
individual states, which are far too small to achieve the necessary
economies of scale.
There should be no question of excluding American products, but the burden
of proof must fall on those defence ministries that wish to buy American
where there is a competitive European alternative. This is a point the
British government should weigh carefully before choosing Lockheed in
preference to the proposed new European military transport aircraft, in
which British industry could play an important part.

FT  09 SEP 94 / A little more to gnaw away: Bernard Simon on separatist
pressures resurfacing in Quebec
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every Quebec nationalist remembers the evening of May 20 1980. The Parti
Quebecois government had lost a referendum in which it had hoped to gain a
mandate to separate from Canada. At the end of an emotional speech to
thousands of downcast supporters at a Montreal arena, the PQ's leader, Mr
Rene Levesque, sounded a consoling note: 'A la prochaine.' Till next time.
The drive towards that next time is set to begin on Monday. If opinion polls
are correct, Quebeckers will sweep the separatists back into power in a
provincial election, ending nine years of rule by the Liberal party, which
wants Quebec to remain part of Canada. The PQ has promised it will
immediately prepare for another referendum in 1995 to decide whether Quebec,
the uniquely French-speaking corner of North America, should go it alone.
The possibility that the world's second biggest country will split up is
likely to heighten nervousness among investors holding Canadian bonds and
doing business in Quebec. Already there is evidence that the uncertainty is
having an economic cost: Quebec's bonds offer a higher return than any of
Canada's other nine provinces, except impoverished Newfoundland.
Changes in Quebec and in its relations with the rest of Canada over the past
14 years have undoubtedly narrowed the odds on an eventual break-up.
Quebeckers already regard themselves in many ways as a separate nation.
Their blue-and-white fleur-de-lys flag is more in evidence on the streets of
Montreal and Quebec City than the Canadian maple leaf.
'The only reason countries stay together is because they share a common
vision and a culture,' says Ms Rita Dionne-Marsolais, who is expected to be
a minister in the new PQ government.
The tide of nationalism is sufficiently strong that Mr Daniel Johnson, the
current Quebec premier expected to lead the Liberals to defeat, felt obliged
to apologise in the campaign for having said he was first and foremost a
Canadian.
Quebec separatism was fuelled in the 1980s by the federal Conservative
government under Mr Brian Mulroney who, unlike Mr Pierre Trudeau in the
1970s, sympathised with Quebec's demands for greater autonomy. Mr Mulroney's
Conservatives also depended on Quebec nationalists for election victories in
1984 and 1988.
Mr Johnson and other present-day federalists have had difficulty countering
the separatists' argument that the rest of Canada has become a burden on
Quebec. Ottawa's debt has swollen to the point where one-third of revenues
are channelled into debt-service payments. The separatists also point to
costly duplication of services between the federal and provincial
governments, among them skills training. And a panoply of internal
non-tariff trade barriers, such as provincial government procurement
preferences, often makes it more difficult for Canadian companies to trade
across provincial borders than to export to the US.
'There is one government too many,' says a senior PQ official.
Many Quebeckers also bristle at real and perceived slights from
English-speaking Canadians. Bilingual signs in faraway Calgary and Vancouver
are dismissed as tokenism. 'There's more interest in learning French in New
York or in San Francisco than in Toronto,' says Ms Dionne-Marsolais.
Federalists hope Monday's election result will reflect little more than
Quebeckers' wish for a change of government. Despite the ebullience of
nationalists, opinion polls confirm a clear (and growing) majority of
Quebeckers is opposed to a total break from Canada.
The business community has kept a low profile during the election campaign.
'I'm not nervous at all,' says the head of one of the province's biggest
financial institutions. 'There's a consensus among French-speaking
businessmen that this is an election, not a referendum. The real fight will
be the referendum.'
But the risk is that the separatists, once in office, will be well placed to
influence public opinion. The PQ has pledged immediately to pass a 'solemn
declaration' in Quebec's national assembly affirming its desire for
negotiations leading to independence and to draft a new constitution.
A separatist government is also expected to provoke confrontation with the
rest of the country to prove its point that Canada is unworkable in its
present form. The PQ's current leader, Mr Jacques Parizeau, has, for
example, given notice that he has little interest in talks on reforming
Canada's social-security and healthcare systems, which are ad-ministered by
the prov-inces but largely funded by Ottawa.
Unlike in 1980, the PQ will be backed by a sizeable contingent of
separatists in the federal parliament in Ottawa. Its recently created
federal counterpart, the Bloc Quebecois, won 54 seats in last year's general
election, making it the official opposition. The BQ's leader, Mr Lucien
Bouchard, is widely considered the shrewdest political leader in Quebec.
One big stumbling block for the PQ, however, is that its strategy for
independence depends heavily on co-operation from the rest of Canada. The PQ
hopes Ottawa would support a sovereign Quebec's admission to the North
American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). It would expect an amicable division
of the federal debt. And the PQ envisages that an independent Quebec would
still use the Canadian dollar, and that Quebeckers would not lose their
Canadian passports.
'I don't expect goodwill, I just expect reasonableness,' says one senior PQ
official.
But such reasonableness cannot be assumed. A raft of potentially explosive
issues is bound to surface. Aboriginal people, who claim title to vast
tracts of Quebec, are opposed to independence and the PQ cannot take the
loyalty of French-speakers in Canada's armed forces for granted.
Perhaps most worrying for ordinary Quebeckers is whether their government
pensions, as well as their retirement savings held by Toronto-based
financial institutions, are secure. Many remember the capital flight from
Quebec before the 1980 referendum which helped accelerate Montreal's
replacement by Toronto as Canada's financial centre.
With both sides wielding such powerful arguments, a referendum - if it takes
place at all - will undoubtedly be a more bitter affair than Monday's
election. One sure bet is that the uncertainty which will prevail as Mr
Levesque's 'next time' approaches will do neither Quebec nor the rest of
Canada much good.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Flawed and selective view of Northern
Ireland (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr A J MCEVOY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Enoch Powell is certainly not naive. Therefore in writing that 'the
beginning of wisdom in approaching Northern Ireland is to clear the mind of
everything conjured up by the term sectarian', he is being more than
selective with the truth. The mind would have to be cleared of memories of
15 years of his presence in South Down Orange Halls, and of the fact that
the Orange Order, vehicle of a sectarian ideology. was specifically
represented on the Ulster Unionist Council, the governing body of Mr
Powell's party. That Order publicly defines its loyalty to the Crown in
terms of a 'Protestant Succession'.
Much of the pain of the last century is a direct consequence of another
English politician 'playing the Orange card'. Now if the mind-clearing
exercise is to promote a non-sectarian solution in Ireland, it would be more
than welcome; but to suggest it in order to consolidate the status quo is
less than candid.

   From Mr ANDREW DYKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As so frequently, Enoch Powell's analysis is both perceptive and flawed
(Personal View, September 7). He is absolutely right to point out that the
dispute in Northern Ireland is about nationality but wrong to see this as a
choice between being British and being Irish. The people of Northern
Ireland, in both communities, have never shown any desire to be British, as
can be demonstrated by their consistent failure to elect British mainstream
party MPs to Westminster; all of the electorate have repeatedly voted for
local fringe candidates and every sitting Ulster MP is a fringe politician.
Mr Powell should reflect that the choice facing the people of Northern
Ireland is between being Irish and being Northern Irish. The majority may
well choose to be Northern Irish, but they should understand the full
implications of that. He, like every unionist politician this century, does
the people of Ulster a grave disservice by continuing to speak of Northern
Ireland as part of the UK when that relationship has never existed outside
legal fiction. He should also reflect that, were the people of Britain to be
asked, by referendum, whether they wished Northern Ireland to be part of
Britain, they would overwhelmingly vote against this.
The 'loyalist' and 'unionist' community must eventually face this reality.
They must decide whether they can go it alone as an independent state within
the European Union or join the rest of the population of the island of
Ireland in forging one secular state. But they have so consistently opposed
the British option that this can no longer be a real possibility for them.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Euro-dust in their eyes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nothing creates more dust in British politics than a row about Europe. The
foggy English mind, ever less self-confident, falls to pieces when it
contemplates political life across the Channel. This has bedevilled
discourse for 40 years, and may do so for as long again. The 'William and
Mary lecture' delivered by the prime minister at Leiden on Wednesday would
serve as a model text for students of self-frustrating rhetoric, were it not
primarily intended to maintain the fragile balance of opinion within the
Conservative party. Mr John Major did his best, but it was the Tories' best,
and that explains everything.
For example, the prime minister sought to dispel what he called a 'ludicrous
caricature' of Britain - that it is interested in no more than a 'glorified
free trade area'. He did not mention the well-known views of his
predecessor, now a caricature of her former self, or her remaining acolytes,
whose devotion to the single market is exceeded only by their detestation of
its institutional implications. Nor did Mr Major dwell on the fact that it
was the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher's attitude to Europe that led to her
defenestration, while he depends for his continuance in office on the
acquiescence of his party's Euro-sceptics.
Only intellectual squirmers could call for a multi-speed Europe with one
breath and then whinge about not being in the fast track with the next. Hold
on, it may be protested, that is not quite fair. A fast track confined to a
small elite should be rejected. 'I recoil from ideas of union in which some
would be more equal than others,' said Mr Major. 'No member state should be
excluded from an area of policy in which it wants and is qualified to
participate.' If he was thinking of the policy document put forward by
Germany's CDU last week, it is true that it alluded to a core comprised of
'five or six countries'. (Translation: Benelux plus France and Germany.)
The CDU paper did, however, go on to say: 'This core must not be closed to
other member states; rather it must be open to every member state willing
and able to meet its requirements.' If that is a first division, it is one
with an open door. Perhaps the prime minister was thinking of the rather
more provocative formulation of the same idea by Mr Edouard Balladur. If the
account I have is right, the French prime minister ob-served that 'for long
years to come, Eu-rope will consist of a central homogenous core, made up
essentially of France and Germany'.
All of this is posturing. In spite of Maastricht, the European Union is
still a collection of independent states, bound by treaties. It is what Mr
Major, and General de Gaulle before him, proclaimed that it should be.
Opt-outs, derogations, empty chairs, vetoes and all the other familiar
devices ensure that this congeries of nations is in permanent negotiating
session. The French and Germans may often lead, but they do not inevitably
get their way, as the prime minister's recent veto demonstrated.
The much-feared 'super state' will only be born when - if - a group of
countries forms a single economic unit, in which a single currency is
managed by a supranational central bank. Such a unit would be something more
than a vast debating chamber in which sovereign governments traded
concessions. It would indeed be an embryo United States of Europe.
Benelux-France-Germany would doubtless constitute the initial agglomeration.
The reasons why this may never happen are often rehearsed, but a British
government should act on the assumption that it will.
What follows then could be the principal question of British politics in the
mid-1990s. Mr Major's opt-out, famously won at Maastricht, leaves it open to
a future administration to decide whether to race to catch up or, instead,
to stay out of a first-division, upper-tier, fast-lane, Franco-German,
single-currency core. Heaven and Mr William Cash alone know what the prime
minister's response would be.
Mr Major may never be put to this particular torture. When (if)
make-up-your-mind-up time comes, the prime minister could well be Mr Tony
Blair. His position is quite clear. It is firmly and unwaveringly on the
fence. 'Exclusion would carry an economic downside,' he said during the
contest for leadership of the Labour party, 'both in terms of the perception
of the long-term strength of the UK economy and of our attractiveness for
world investment.' Plain enough. Except that 'on the other hand, the price
of joining without genuine convergence may, precisely because of underlying
economic weakness, be too high to pay'.
The Labour leader does have one advantage over the prime minister. Mr Major
is obliged by his precarious political situation to sound unenthusiastic
about strengthening the institutions of the EU; he must focus on
enlargement. Mr Blair leads a party of recent converts to the European
mirage. He is happy to embrace the social legislation shunned by the
Conservatives. He can say, as he has, that the purpose of accepting further
integration 'is not to deny our sovereignty, but . . . to extend our
sovereignty by deciding that our future prosperity depends on co-operating
with other nations . . .'. He can talk Europese; Mr Major can only speak
Klingon.
Britain's European policy ought to have a single objective: to get into the
lead and represent British interests. That might have meant establishing a
threesome with France and Germany, but successive British governments have
been too inconstant for that. It could have meant becoming an unofficial
leader of the smaller countries, but we have seemed too anti-federal for
that. Mr Major is winning some support from the Dutch and the Italians, but
he would be unwise to bank on either.
In spite of his cautiousness, Mr Blair is better-placed. He can appeal to
the pro-European streak in the British psyche. When Labour turned against
the then Common Market, it split. Its new leader cannot compete with Mr
Major for the allegiance of Euro-sceptics. He could, instead, make his
cleverest colleague, Mr Robin Cook, shadow foreign secretary. He might then
set him the task of convincing the electorate that a Labour government would
end the long record of Britain's failure to establish a lasting,
satisfactory relationship with the EU. We might even believe him.

Sir, Your reporting of Jonathan Aitken's interview omitted a significant
point ('Aitken targets housing benefit', September 6).
Commenting on economic recovery, the Treasury chief secretary referred to
company profits increasing and said '. . . these should be being used for
new investment and new jobs'. The italics, as far as they can be determined
in a radio interview, are Mr Aitken's.
Those investors, whether tax-exempt or otherwise, who depend on a flow of
company dividends to meet their commitments, would do well to reflect on
this remark and its implications for government policy on taxation and
dividends.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Speed differential in Europe is a
fact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER W BARKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As we move from discussing a two-speed Europe to a multi-speed and now
a two-tier Europe, politicians manoeuvre and the prime minister, John Major,
seems to have forgotten his triumph at Maastricht in 'winning the argument
about Britain's right to opt out of parts of the treaty'.
Of course, as everybody knows except the British (and the Italians?), a
multi-speed Europe was a reality well before Major accepted paternity at
Maastricht. Sadly, what seems to be missed by both the British and Italians
in the debate about Europe is their relative isolation, a geographic fact
linked to an associated cultural effect.
In Tuesday's front-page article, your headline reads: 'Kohl plays down plan
for multi-speed EU'. In most countries except the UK and Italy, what matters
is not that such a thing is, or might be, planned: after all, it is actually
happening before our very eyes.
Apparently, the British are unable yet to bring themselves to realise, as
the Dutch have done, that their prosperity and influence depend upon making
the European Union work. Meanwhile, the speed differential between the UK
and those countries in the fast lane will increase. Not because politicians
in Germany or elsewhere may have decreed it, but simply because that is the
way it is and has been for the past 40 years, even if most of the British
press, in concert with the politicians - and circulation directors - has
been unable or unwilling to see it.
True independence is appreciating the reality of one's own capacity. The
tragedy of Britain's position is its failure to see this, whatever John
Major and his supporters may say.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Strong arguments for mutual ownership
(2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DONALD H KIRKHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article 'Mutual destruction' presented a one-sided analysis of the
disadvantages of the mutual form of corporate organisation and the
advantages of the plc form.
There are three key advantages in retaining mutual building societies:
Building societies offer a better service to their customers than other
organisations. Market research undertaken by BMRB International shows that,
compared with other institutions, building societies are much more likely to
be perceived as dealing with their customers fairly, more likely to be
understanding of their financial problems, more able to communicate with
their customers, taking complaints more seriously, and not pestering their
customers about their service.
Building societies offer lower mortgage rates and higher savings rates than
their competitors. A recent survey by the specialist magazine, What
Mortgage, shows that, of the 20 institutions which have charged least
interest on their mortgages over the previous ten years, 19 were building
societies. In contrast, of the most expensive 20 institutions seven were
banks. Similarly, banks rarely feature in the 'best buys' analyses of
savings products.
Diversity of business organisation. It is unlikely that one particular form
of corporate body embodies within it all the attributes necessary to create
the perfect organisation. Mutuals and plcs each have their own
characteristics, and it is likely that the economy as a whole is stronger if
the two forms of organisation are able to compete with each other.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest Alison Smith's article 'Mutual destruction'
(September 5). While I can only write on the subject of mutual life
assurance companies, I would, with authority, venture to suggest that there
is a very strong argument for the continuation of this class of financial
institution.
Although a large number of mutuals will have far fewer owners than would
result in them enjoying 'a one-in-a-million say' in strategy, I would
suggest that this is irrelevant, since the same is undoubtedly true of the
majority of proprietary institutions where, however wide may be the
ownership, control invariably vests with a small number of highly
influential investors, many of whom will themselves be financial
institutions.
Smith dismisses the value-for-money arguments which justify mutual
ownership. Take for example, however, the case of a 25-year endowment
assurance. Typically, the shareholders, in a proprietary office, take out
more money over the term than does the life office, to cover expenses, and
the sales outlet, for commission, put together.
Should the Treasury encourage de-mutualisation, this would hold no terror
for us. But there would be a clear loss to future policyholders and, indeed,
the UK economy.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Arts: Carving out a drama in the courtroom - Sore about its
treatment by the UK government, the Getty is determined to win possession of
the Three Graces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Today the never-ending saga of the Three Graces moves into the courtroom. A
judge will decide whether the complaint by the Getty Museum of Malibu,
California, that the British Government has broken its own rules on the
export of works of art, has substance.
It is amazing it has come to this. The Getty, the most generously endowed
museum in the world, with a Dollars 4bn bequest from oil billionaire J. Paul
Getty to administer, has always prided itself on playing fair, on not using
its financial muscle to rampage through the treasure troves of nations.
It expects governments to play fair too. But having waited since 1989 to
take possession of Canova's statue, which it bought for Pounds 7.6m, and
confident that the August deadline postponing its export from the UK would
be the last, the Getty is up in arms at the unexpected delay. This enabled
Timothy Clifford of the National Galleries of Scotland to ride belatedly to
the rescue and unearth two rich friends of the UK, John Paul Getty II and
Baron Thyssen, who have promised Pounds 1m and Pounds 800,000 respectively
to save the Three Graces for the UK.
No wonder the Getty's mild mannered director John Walsh is roused. 'We have
been treated shabbily,' he said. 'The government has changed its own rules
and ignored its own deadlines whenever it was convenient. What's at issue is
not just the Three Graces: it is the fair administration of the export
review system in Britain.'
Few objects of art more suit the Getty than the Three Graces. Getty loved
antiquity. His museum is fashioned after a Roman villa which disappeared on
the eruption of Vesuvius. Canova's fantasy of the daughters of Jove
embracing in marble harks directly back to classical times.
A visit to the Getty on its hillside perch confirms that the Three Graces
would fit beautifully into an airy alcove there, alongside statues, framed
by the fountains, shrubs and frescoes of the museum and with the Pacific
Ocean in the distance. The likely loss of the statue has put iron into
Walsh's soul. It is not the first time the Getty has been pipped at the
post. A Duccio painting and a Bernini bust were also retained in the UK
thanks to the Clifford-Getty II partnership.
Despite an annual expenditure budget in excess of Dollars 200m, the Getty
Trust, which administers the museum, has traditionally behaved prudently.
'We have not used our cheque book to pay over the odds, nor have we hidden
behind false identities,' says Walsh. The trust has played the game,
respecting the national heritages of the European countries which mainly
hold the objects of art it seeks. 'We only succeed in acquiring about one
object in every four or five that we would like,' says Walsh. In the future
this restraint in spending the Dollars 60m or so a year the museum sets
aside for acquisitions may be loosened.
Apart from the increasingly restrictive export policies for antiques
operated by European Union nations, the Getty imposes its own checks on
acquisitions. It respects the passions of its founder, who mainly bought
antiquities, Renaissance and Baroque paintings and European decorative arts.
Its collection does not contain anything made after 1900, its painting
display culminating in a selection of dramatic works by Ensor, Munch and,
most notably, Van Gogh - a version of 'Irises' which at more than Dollars
40m was the Getty's most expensive single acquisition.
The 1900 time limit is unlikely to change, though Walsh has cast off some of
the self-imposed limitations: there is little point having so much potential
buying power if you do not try to form the finest collections in the world
in certain fields.
So the Getty has focused on photography. Its collection of more than 60,000
images, from Fox Talbot to American 20th-century greats such as Weston -
Walsh says a photography archive stopping at 1900 is a nonsense - is
considered the ultimate. Selective collections of drawings and manuscripts
have also been assembled.
But to the visitor the eye catchers are in the traditional areas: the
antiquities, purged of the rogue fake; the paintings, from Rembrandt to
David and including the most expensive Old Master ever acquired at auction -
Pontormo's portrait of Cosimo de Medici, which cost Dollars 35m in 1989; and
the panelled rooms displaying an ornate procession of French design, from
Regence through Rococo to Neo-Classical.
By 1997 a new museum, built atop a nearby hill with views across Los
Angeles, will open.
Called the Getty Center, it will cost Dollars 700m and be four times larger
than the villa, which will remain the home of the antiquities.
The rest of the collection, including many objects currently warehoused,
will move into a museum campus designed by Richard Meier. It is the
construction of the new museum which is absorbing most of the Getty's
invested revenues, though there are still millions to spare each year for
conservation projects and scholarship.
Although running two museums plus satellite activities will increase the
operating costs of the Getty Trust, the completion of the Center will leave
more money to spend. The Getty will want some fine objects to fill its new
galleries but it is finding it ever harder to acquire them. Walsh admits
this is a growing problem. Most of the pre-1900 masterpieces are safely
ensconced in museums worldwide.
The Getty can, however, make private deals: it recently acquired a very fine
Tiepolo through Switzerland. In spite of Walsh's protestations it certainly
pays top prices. Perhaps Turner's dramatic seascape 'Von Tromp doing the
will of his Master' is just about worth the Dollars 17m the Getty paid, but
other recent payouts, such as Pounds 4.95m for a Goya bull fighting scene
and Dollars 11m for a Sebastiano portrait of Pope Clement VII, look on the
high side.
These paintings were bought openly. The worry is that, affronted by the
delays and the dubious justifications of the UK government over the Three
Graces, the Getty will be inclined to go behind backs and negotiate
privately with British aristocrats, German princes, and French counts.
At the moment the art market is still suffering from post-recession blues
and little of unquestionable brilliance is coming forward. In a year or two
the Getty, with its bulging pockets, will be ready to power the market's
revival, while at the same time showing less sensitivity to national pride.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Arts: Mixed blessings on offer in the first set - Venice
Film Festiva / Nigel Andrews views some multi-nation hybrids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Planning a film festival programme is like seeding a tennis tournament. How
do you place your best players for maximum effect? How do you make sure
Antonioni does not knock out Bergman in the early rounds - by colliding too
closely in the viewer's first-week memory - or that the final head-to-head
is not between Mr Unheard-Of from Thuringia and Miss Token Feminist from
Thirdworldia?
Venice's Gillo Pontecorvo decided on a bold solution this year: schedule all
the resistible stuff in the first four days, and clear the courts for a
final week of Ermanno Olmi, Wim Wenders, Woody Allen, Oliver Stone and other
class players.
This is good news for almost everyone. The only loser is the critic writing
on the morning of the fifth day. Peering into his memory bank, he sees a
jumble of nightmare celluloid more suggestive of a mad scientist let loose
in a genetic engineering lab than of opening days at the movie equivalent of
Wimbledon.
There was the Anglo-Macedonian film about civil war, Before The Rain; an
Anglo-Hungarian offering about magic bullets and mystical rabbits, called
Magic Hunter; an Italian-Hungarian-Croatian film about bull-stealing, Il
Toro; the Italian film called Lamerica that never got to L'America; and the
New York-set drama Little Odessa in which an Austrian (Maximilian Schell)
and two Brits (Tim Roth and Vanessa Redgrave) play a Russian-American
immigrant family.
We know co-productions mean multi-national investment, but this is
ridiculous. The best two films at Venice so far - may the lesson be learned
 -were the mono-cultural Long Live Love, a Taiwanese production, and the
almost likewise Loaded. 'Almost' because New Zealand director Anna Campion,
sister of Jane of The Piano fame, strayed into Britain to make this
psychodrama-cum-black-comedy. But then no two cultures are more compatible
than those of NZ and the UK. Same language, same repressive wholesomeness,
same ability to find nightmares under the tea table.
The film is about seven youngsters dossing in a country mansion making a
horror video. In the process they uncover secrets about themselves which
prove more X-certificate than the shoestring shocker they are shooting -
this being a kind of splatter version of an Esther Williams musical.
Campion's first feature is hauntingly assured. It takes what could have been
a ragbag of moth-eaten conventions - old dark house, sexual-jealousy chamber
drama, idiot-youth comedy a la Withnail And I - and after briefly
deconstructing each, quilts them seamlessly into collective character study.
The film is deeply imaginative in its use of different visual modes (video,
celluloid) to underscore different states of mind. And it is frightening
precisely because it goes beyond Gothic into a grand guignol of the mind.
Long Live Love, from Taiwan's Tsai Ming-liang, goes one better than
transmuting yesterday's genres: it invents one of its own. How do we
describe this maze-like essay in minimalism about two young men and a young
woman who wander in and out of each other's lives and in and out of a single
empty apartment?
The film is like Jacques Tati and Roman Polanski meeting in a Mondrian
painting. The glacial apartment has the eroticism of vacancy. Together and
singly the trespassing characters act out their fantasies, comic and
melancholic, while the camera roams over the sign language of the lonely.
Hints of auto-eroticism, more-than-hints of transvestism, displays of
paranoia or wayward passion. And when togetherness accidentally happens,
touches of Feydeau farce creep into the bleached geometric existentialism.
Is this apartment a symbolic womb - a pre-guilt playroom for the human soul?
Is it a maze for experimental human mice? Or is it . . . ?
It could be all and any of these; the movie has a perfect, daring openness.
It comes without 'message' and virtually without dialogue. Yet it is so
wittily styled, so playful in its cross-pollination of lives and fetishisms,
that the interpretative choices are rich.
So even the best-laid plans of 'worst first' tournament devisers can go
wrong. Besides, if you get fed up with the official event at Venice there
are always the friendly fixtures on the outer courts. Veterans like King
Vidor don their full 'retrospective' kit and prance about on the prescribed
rectangle: you can see the master's greatest silent hits from The Big Parade
to The Crowd. And you can enjoy one-off exhibition matches from the likes of
Kon Ichikawa, Oscar-winning British animator Nick Park (of Creature Comforts
fame) and the late Rainer Werner Fassbinder.
There is Hollywood too, that eternal tennis circus tramping the globe and
celebrated in this year's Venezia Notte section: floodlit knockouts between
Tom Hanks (Forrest Gump) and Arnold Schwarzenegger (True Lies), Harrison
Ford (Clear And Present Danger) and Jack Nicholson (Wolf). Even in a bad
Venice year - or a bad Venice week - there is something for everyone.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Arts: Unifying sounds - Proms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Berlin, Cleveland, Los Angeles, Dresden and Pittsburgh: the visiting
orchestras marking the climax of the Proms' 100th season have assembled from
the world's musical capitals. It is not entirely a coincidence that they all
come from either Germany or the US. Between them those two countries can
boast an enviable proportion of the top international orchestras.
This year the Dresden Staatskapelle followed hard on the heels of the Berlin
Philharmonic, and making comparisons between them is inevitable. In a
unified Germany the orchestras of east and west have found themselves rivals
for the country's accolade as number one. Usually one would expect the
Berlin Philharmonic's uniquely rich sound to make it a clear first choice,
but that was not how it seemed after the Dresden Staatskapelle's concerts on
Tuesday and Wednesday.
The two cities are fortunate their orchestras are so different. Berlin
represents the future capital's proud self-confidence; Dresden is old-world
grace and quiet authority. There was a natural sense of scale in the Dresden
players' music-making, which allowed every point to register easily, not
just the big, barnstorming moments which made an impression with Berlin.
The first of the Dresden concerts opened with understated performances of
Weber's Overture to Euryanthe and Dvorak's tone-poem The Wood Dove. Colin
Davis has become an ever subtler conductor in recent years, and the unforced
musicality of the Dresden orchestra makes them well suited to each other. In
works which the players know backwards, like Beethoven's 'Pastoral' Symphony
in the second Prom, he is content to lean back and leave them to play. The
peasants' dance was more a bucolic minuet. The thunderstorm movement was
music first, storm second  - all of impeccable quality.
As a young man, Davis was renowned for his fiery championing of Berlioz, but
one would not immediately have recognised that here. Maybe the orchestra has
the upper hand in the relationship, for the Dresden Staatskapelle does excel
at bringing a classical sense of order and proportion to everything it
plays. Unfortunately, Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique is music at the other
extreme, the outpouring of a fevered and irrational mind, flirting with
chaos. This Dresden performance never surrendered to its passions. It was
immaculately controlled and unexciting.
The second Prom was the better of the two. As well as the Beethoven, there
was Brahms' First Symphony, an honorary classical symphony if ever there was
one. Davis worked the orchestra harder in this and there was more drive and
tension to the playing. Even so, the symphony has never sounded less like an
old warhorse, thanks to the elegance of the wind playing, the subtlety of
the balance, the refusal to countenance noise or bombast. Among the ranks of
international orchestras the Dresden Staatskapelle ranks as a thoroughbred.

Although the autumn season is grinding into gear, there are still lots of
repeats, especially on BBC2 which manages only 15 minutes of original matter
between 5.30 and 9.00. Some of the old stuff is retro-telly, kitsch nonsense
such as Captain Scarlet And The Mysterons which broadcasters like to call
'cult' series. This implies passionate dedication but usually means that
only a few people actually want to watch. At 9.00 on BBC2 comes World Cup
Athletics, which, for me, will be a meeting too far. Linford Christie's poor
showing since the Commonwealth Games suggests that television's keenness to
promote the sport has resulted in too many meetings. BBC2's most interesting
programme promises to be The Longest Walk, in which Janet Street-Porter
joins Ffyona Campbell on the final stages of her journey. It is tempting
because Campbell's mother describes her as pig-headed and her former support
driver as horrible (10.00). Two other programmes also depend upon strong
characters making journeys: Tom Vernon in Fat Man In France (7.30 BBC1); and
John Betjeman in The Lost Betjemans (8.00 C4).

FT  09 SEP 94 / People: BTR talks about its next generation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Alan Jackson, chief executive of BTR, regrets that yesterday's concern over
pressure on the industrial conglomerate's profit margins may have
overshadowed what he describes as a 'very significant' trio of appointments
to the group's main board.
Jackson, an Australian, is 58 - as in a few days will be his American chief
operating officer, Bob Faircloth. Group policy is that executives retire at
62, so although the succession is not an immediate issue, Jackson says it is
important for BTR to bring on the 'next generation'.
The three new executive directors are Chris Burns, a 51-year-old Englishman;
Paul Buysse, 49, who is Belgian; and John Thompson, a 47-year-old American.
Burns joined BTR in 1991 through the group's Pounds 1.55bn acquisition of
Hawker Siddeley, where he was director of the aerospace division. His
responsibilities have expanded and he is now one of the group's regional
chief executives, overseeing businesses which include batteries, aerospace,
valves and construction.
Buysse, who speaks several European languages, joined BTR in 1988 as group
managing director of Hansen Transmission International. He became a regional
chief executive in February and has responsibility for businesses such as
Brook Hansen Motors and Dunlop Slazenger.
Thompson joined BTR in 1976 through the acquisition of Stowe Woodward
Industries. As a regional chief executive, his groups are predominantly
US-based and include paper technology, US motors, meters and control systems
and the manufacturer Rexnord.
Faircloth says he worked closely with Thompson in the US over the past 10
years and describes Burns as a great strategic and lateral thinker. Jackson
says he is delighted that in Buysse, BTR has finally got a non-Anglo Saxon
on its board.

Christine Laird, Derby's director of housing and environmental services, has
been appointed chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Housing. The
institute, which has 12,000 members, represents housing professionals, with
the bulk of its members working in local authority housing or for housing
associations.
Aged 38, Laird has experience of most aspects of public housing. She started
as a trainee housing manager in Birmingham's housing department in 1974 and
worked her way up to housing centre manager.
After a period as housing director of Copec housing trust, she returned to
municipal housing as assistant city housing officer for Worcester. She was
deputy housing director of Leicester City Council before moving to Derby.
A vice-president of the institute, she is currently a member of the Northern
Ireland Housing Policy Review Group and principal adviser on housing to the
Association of District Councils.
Derby is one of eight local authorities piloting compulsory competitive
tendering in housing management for the Environment department.
Laird will take up her new post in December, succeeding Peter McGurk, chief
executive for the past 12 years. McGurk becomes managing director of Inside
Communications, the institute's commercial arm which organises conferences
and produces publications on housing.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Property: The end of an affair - Pension funds are shunning
property
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK pension funds have fallen out of love with property over the past 15
years. The weighting of property within the average pension fund investment
portfolio has fallen steadily from a peak in the late 1970s. Since
occupational pension funds control assets of about Pounds 450bn, this
dwindling interest can hardly be good news for commercial property values.
By the same token, the market would benefit if pension funds could be
tempted back into the fold.
The extent of the shift away from property is difficult to judge. In 1979
the largest pension funds - represented by W M Company's top 50 schemes -
held 27 per cent of their assets in property. This share had fallen to 7 per
cent by the end of 1993. But smaller funds were never as enthusiastic as
their bigger peers. The administrative burden of owning property is more
difficult for small funds to cope with. Alternatives to direct ownership,
such as investing in property unit trusts, have draw-backs, such as lack of
liquidity when the market is falling. According to performance measurement
company CAPs, the average pension fund now has only 1.6 per cent of its
assets in commercial property.
The decline in property weightings is partly due to the poor performance of
property relative to other financial assets - especially equities - during
the 1980s. Even if pension funds did not sell property, the property share
tended to shrink as a proportion of total assets. But neither did pension
funds purchase additional property to keep their investment mix steady. Fund
managers and their actuarial advisers were happy to drift towards equities.
The reasons for this change of heart are complex. The indifferent investment
returns from property during the 1980s led to some disillusionment. The
introduction of index-linked gilts may also have played a part, by offering
fund managers a hedge against inflation of the type traditionally provided
by property.
The gradual ageing of pension schemes is another factor. Funds which cover a
high proportion of people approaching retirement are more likely to invest
in bonds - which are a better match for their liabilities - than equities or
property. Very mature funds also tend to favour liquid investments which can
be realised easily if required to meet pensions obligations.
The government's white paper on pension reform, published in June, could
lead pension fund managers further away from property. By linking pension
liabilities to gilts for the purposes of a statutory solvency test, the
proposals are likely to swing the investment pendulum in favour of bonds and
away from property.
The politics of investment management may also have played its part. Fund
managers competing for pension fund business are unwilling to risk having
their investment performance tarnished by a heavy weighting in favour of
property which can not be reduced quickly if the market turns sour. Big
pension funds which manage money themselves can afford to take a long term
view. It is no coincidence that they are powerful advocates of property.
The property profession may also be to blame for not keeping pace with the
professional standards set in the equity and bond markets. Fund management,
valuation, rent collection and transaction fees tend to discourage fund
trustees and eat into investment returns which are already lower than
equities.
'The profession has in the past shot itself in the foot,' said Mr Nigel
O'Sullivan of consulting actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow. 'Although some are now
making amends, the question is whether it is too late.' For all but the
largest funds, illiquidity and administrative hassle are powerful reasons to
steer clear. Securities linked to property values - such as Barclay's Pounds
150m issue of Property Index Certificates launched earlier this year -
could, in theory, get round both problems. But there are few potential
issuers. Barclay's is unusual in having more property assets than it wants.
It was therefore happy to issue a matching liability which reduced its
overall exposure.
Still, such instruments could allow pension funds to move in and out of
property at lower cost. If more issuers can be found there are plenty of
fund managers prepared to argue that pension funds should take advantage.
They point out that the link between property values and the performance of
equity and bonds is low. Investing in property can therefore protect the
value of a fund when other markets are falling.
'There is a strong diversification argument in favour of property,' said Mr
Roy Peters, head of pension fund investment at British Gas Pension Fund
Managers, which manages Pounds 8.4bn assets. 'This year could bring home to
many pension funds that property can do well even when other financial
assets are suffering.'
Just because equities have outperformed property in the past there is no
guarantee that they will do so in future. On a long-term view, the
performance of equities through the 1980s was exceptional and - in the view
of many actuaries - unsustainable. If the gradual shift of pension funds
into equities provided fuel for a 10-year bull market, shares could suffer
if funds now shift back into bonds as a result of the proposed solvency
test.
It is equally possible that the underperformance of property during the
1980s was partly caused by lack of support from pension funds. The average
yield on investment properties rose steadily from a trough of 4.4 per cent
in 1974 to 8 per cent in 1992. It is no coincidence that pension funds were
reducing their exposure during this period.
Looked at another way, as pension funds have matured and other financial
markets developed, fund managers have become less tolerant of illiquid
assets such as property. If the illiquidity premium they demand for holding
property rather than equities or index-linked bonds has risen, property
yields may never fall back to the levels of the 1970s. Unless, that is, the
industry can find ways of making the business of investing in property more
user-friendly.
For fund managers prepared to take a long-term view, property yields in 1992
were nevertheless cheap. There has been a modest increase in property
weightings as a result. If the trickle of pension fund money back into
property over the past two years is to be more than a temporary move,
though, the industry will have to try harder to accommodate these powerful
investors.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Technology: Finding the best performers - A new database
designed to ease product comparison in the financial services industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week saw the launch of the UK's first comprehensive product database
for the financial services industry.
The development comes at a time when insurance companies, investment houses
and financial advisers are under intense pressure to improve product design
and value for money for customers.
The Aequos database is the brainchild of The Research Department, a team of
seven consultants with experience in life assurance, pensions and
investment.
While other databases tend to specialise in a narrow range of products sold
through independent advisers, Aequos includes all products irrespective of
distribution channel or whether or not commission is payable to advisers and
salesmen.
The technology applied to the database makes this a practical business tool,
which is simple to use. It costs Pounds 5,000 a year per module - or
individual product group - of information. The full package costs Pounds
20,000 a year. The programme, which is updated monthly by disc, runs on any
IBM compatible PC using the Windows operating system.
Even technophobes will find the operating instructions easy. After signing
on to their computer and clicking on to the Aequos icon, users are in the
database and can go on to select an area of interest, pointing the cursor,
and clicking the mouse.
Aequos covers the entire range of regulated and many general insurance
products. The system includes more than 100 insurance companies, 200
personal equity plan (Pep) providers, 300 investment trusts and 1,400 unit
trusts. The latter three groups account for more than 200 investment
managers.
Mark Hayes-Newington, director of The Research Department, said: 'The system
is designed to give skilled staff more time to spend using information
instead of losing time collecting it. Moreover, Aequos tells you not only
who does what but how well they do it.'
The products fall into four categories, each with its own subsections.
Pensions, including personal pensions, self-invested personal pensions
(SIPPs), phased retirement plans, expatriate pensions, executive plans,
small self-administered schemes, funded unapproved retirement benefits
(Furbs) and transfer plans.
Investment, including annuities, back-to-backs (hybrids that combine two or
more products to meet a specific need), savings plans, maximum investment
plans (Mips), endowments, peps, bonds, investment trusts and unit trusts.
Protection, including term assurance, whole of life, permanent health
insurance (PHI), private medical insurance (PMl), long-term care and
critical illness.
Group (company schemes), including pensions, life, PMl and PHI.
A fifth module, of company profiles supplied by consulting actuaries AKG,
offers analysis of a company's structure, management, sales data, financial
strength, investment policy, administration and service efficiency, and
distribution channels.
Changes in the regulation of investment products, which come into force in
January next year, have encouraged many providers to redesign investment and
savings products to compete in what is expected to be a much more demanding,
consumer-led market.
At the core of Aequos is a series of product tables with details on more
than 60 product features ranging from charging structures, flexibility and
performance to the small print on loyalty bonuses and segmentation of
insurance company pension policies.
Users keen to analyse products in depth can 'interrogate' the key tables for
detailed technical specifications.
Providers who want to assess their brand's competitive position in the
market will find all the primary research at their fingertips. A brand can
be checked against competitors or against a select number on the basis of
particular features. The Research Department, which is independent of the
financial services industry, ranks and benchmarks product features in a
process known as Data Numerical Analysis, which gives a standard measure for
comparison purposes.
Users highlight the relevant products and instruct the system to make the
comparison on the basis of a self-selected list of criteria.
For example, a life office wanting to launch a new personal pension aimed at
younger people would be keen to check that its plan compared well on
flexibility of premiums so that the client could stop and restart
contributions to suit his or her changing work patterns.
Aequos users can compare and rank products by any combination of providers
and by any number of features. Product comparisons are presented in a graph.
The system allows users to switch quickly from tables to technical pages to
examine detailed policy information and to clarify any confusion. Direct
comparison of technical information of several providers simultaneously is
possible through the Windows system. Sales data from the company profiles
module can also be ranked and sorted.
Swift and accurate comparative analysis allows providers to pinpoint where
their own products excel and fall short, and to target improvements and new
launches.
This will prove a welcome change to the more costly, complex and inefficient
scatter-gun approach now used, whereby providers design 'me-too' products
that include every feature imaginable.
General Accident is one of several large insurance companies in the UK that
have signed up for the full service.
David Heslop, marketing manager, said: 'Quality and timely information is
what marketing is all about and there is no doubt that the Aequos system
will provide this. Using the database will make us more efficient and
cost-effective. This will translate into better product design and
distribution, which ultimately will mean better value for money for our
customers.'
John Green, information services manager at Norwich Union, said: 'At present
our product analysis relies on a paper-based system and direct contacts. My
next project was to try to design exactly the system Aequos offers so its
arrival on the scene was very timely.'
A third heavyweight insurer, Commercia1 Union, has also signed up. Ian
Frater, information manager, says the system will 'improve the efficiency
and accuracy of our marketing department'.
Aequos also offers a range of services for financial advisers according to
need and pocket. Large firms covering all markets are likely to prefer the
full service to identify the most competitive products for clients.
The comparative analysis facility will help advisers to demonstrate the
respective merits of shortlisted products, while the link to Micropal
statistics on investment performance allows the adviser to cross-check
relative performance - a vital ingredient in the product selection process.
Specialist firms of advisers can buy individual modules while small firms
will he interested in the 'best advice panel' service. By law, independent
advisers are expected to broke the entire market to select the right
products for clients, a time-consuming and expensive exercise.
Using Aequos, advisers identify the key criteria for product selection for
their client base. This is fed into the system which produces on disc a
shortlist including the most attractive products and providers based on the
adviser's own criteria.
Early next year, a real charge analysis system will be added. Under the new
regulatory regime providers must tell customers exactly what their charges
are and how they impact on the investment returns throughout the term of the
contract.
Until July this year, providers were allowed to disguise real charges by
using an industry standard formula in their investment projections.
Best advice under the new regime will require advisers to demonstrate a
detailed knowledge of product charges. Once this information is on the
Aequos system, real charges can be taken into consideration along with other
product features.
Product details: Aequos is available from The Research Department Ltd,
Brands House, Kingshill Road, High Wycombe, Bucks HP13 5BD. Tel; 0494
714040. Fax; 0494 718080. The programme runs on IBM compatible PCs using the
current Windows operating system. The Research Department installs the
database, provides training and a helpline service.

The reliability of the manufacturing methods used to build high-temperature
superconducting chips has been improved by a technique originally developed
for the semiconductor industry.
Thomas Swan, a Cambridge-based equipment supplier, working in conjunction
with Superconductor Technologies of California, has built a chemical vapour
deposition system for coating thin-film wafers with a high-temperature
superconducting material.
The system incorporates monitors to control the exact composition of the
growing films, which will reduce the frequency of defects.
Superconductor Technologies, which is developing high-temperature
superconductors for microelectronic applications, says the new method will
replace its existing laser-based deposition system. It expects it will
increase its manufacturing capacity 20-fold and cut costs by a third.

Ground containing buried electrical cables or gas pipes is usually dug up by
hand to avoid damage by the hard-cutting teeth of conventional excavators.
Concept Engineering Group, a Pittsburgh-based engineering company, has
designed a trench-digging machine that avoids damaging cables and pipes by
using supersonic jets of air to crumble the soil, after which the soil is
scooped up using a vacuum system.
The system, which was designed for the Electric Power Research Institute of
California, is now being modified in the hope that it can be used for
environmental waste clean-ups and bulk material handling.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Method unearthed for drying
wood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scientists at the University of St Andrews have developed a process, called
supercritical drying, to treat wooden objects after they are unearthed from
an archaeological excavation.
It involves soaking the wood in methanol to replace the water, after which
the wood is placed in a chamber containing carbon dioxide in the form of dry
ice. The methanol is then dissolved out of the wood by warming the carbon
dioxide to the point when it becomes a 'supercritical fluid'. In this state,
the carbon dioxide is a high pressure gas, which has the advantage that the
wood is not subjected to drying stresses when it is removed.
The university believes this system is an advance on conventional drying
methods, which involve impregnating the wood with polyethylene glycol. This
accelerates the corrosion of metals, making it unsuitable for objects made
from both wood and metal, such as knives.

blind
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A town in Sweden has installed a system based on magnetic sensors to help
blind and partially-sighted people find their way around.
The Hanmyo system, which was developed by NEC, the Japanese group, consists
of ferrite particles embedded in paving slabs on a designated route through
town. These interact with a magnetic sensor incorporated within the user's
white cane, causing the cane to vibrate when it comes in contact with the
ferrite pavements. At certain points in the town, the cane activates
loudspeakers which provide information on street names and potential
hazards.
This is the first Hanmyo system to be installed in Europe, although 100
similar systems have already been installed in buildings and streets in
Japan.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Management: How to turn signals into knowledge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From Peter Drucker to Alvin Toffler, most western business sages have been
arguing for the past few years that information and knowledge have replaced
capital, labour and other physical resources as the key differentiators in
global competition.
In simple English, that means companies need to grow much more adept at
creating innovative products and services ahead of their rivals. To do so,
they must become better at detecting external information which is relevant
to them, and adding value to it internally. That, in turn, requires them to
become 'learning organisations'. This is a tough task for any sizeable
company, but especially for a multinational with far-flung operations around
the globe.
The trouble is that most western managers suffer from rampant confusion
about the nature of information. So they fail to use knowledge effectively,
and are wrong-footed in the market by their more aware Asian rivals.
In a brave bid to rectify this deficiency, the research arm of PE
International, a UK management consultancy, has just published a useful
report called Understanding Information*. It examines the nature of
information, the mental processes by which it develops growing levels of
meaning, and how individuals and organisations can become better at adding
commercial value to it.
The report suggests that the creation of information is sparked by a series
of raw 'signals' of various kinds, including visual, verbal and tactile
ones. This raw data is then transformed into information by being sieved
through each individual's 'mental model' - the implicit attitudes,
experience and view of the world that most people's minds take for granted.
A more conscious form of processing then establishes the significance of
that information to the individual, who acts on it accordingly. Feedback
from the results of that action then sets the learning cycle in train again.
Good users of information understand their mental models, make their
assumptions explicit, and have effective feedback and learning mechanisms,
says the report.
The problem with this picture is twofold. First, few western individuals or
organisations are as effective learners as that. Second, it assumes that
most information is either already explicit, or can quickly be made so. In a
phrase, it deals better with the way information is processed and used than
with how it is created.
For a deeper understanding of that we must turn to Ikujiro Nonaka and
Hirotaka Takeuchi, two Japanese professors who are writing a book, to be
published next year, called The Knowledge-Creating Company**.
In a fascinating preliminary paper presented this summer at an international
symposium of academics organised by the Stockholm School of Economics, the
duo argued that the global success of Japanese companies has been due, above
all, to their ability to create new knowledge, to disseminate it throughout
the organisation, and to embody it into products, services and systems.
There is a simple reason, say Nonaka and Takeuchi, why western writers and
managers tend not to address the question of how to create organisational
knowledge: that they have a deep-set view of organisations as machines for
processing existing information.
This view, argue the professors, is ingrained in a century of western
management thought. It sees knowledge as necessarily explicit - something
formal and systematic, which can be expressed in words and numbers, and
easily communicated and shared.
Japanese companies, says the duo, have a very different perception. They
recognise that the knowledge expressed in words and numbers represents only
the tip of an iceberg. They view knowledge as primarily 'tacit' - rooted
deeply in the action and experience of individuals, and not easily visible.
It is hard to express, to formalise, and to communicate.
Nonaka and Takeuchi's analysis becomes particularly helpful when, using
practical examples from Japanese industry, they distinguish between various
ways in which tacit knowledge can be mobilised.
First - and most surprising at first sight - they show that it can sometimes
be transferred between individuals without becoming explicit. Honda and
parts of Matsushita are particularly adept at doing this, they claim.
But the key to knowledge creation is the conversion of tacit knowledge into
the explicit variety. This is far from easy, given that possessors of tacit
knowledge may not always 'know what they know', so to speak. The academics
show how Canon, Honda and Matsushita accomplish this transfer process by
encouraging teams to use metaphor and analogy to loosen up their thinking.
In their discussion of how organisations can stimulate what they call a
'knowledge spiral', Nonaka and Takeuchi also draw on research within NEC,
Fuji-Xerox, Nissan and other companies. Among other points, they stress the
importance of creative chaos, or 'reflection in action'; the need for
employees to have constant access to information that may in the short term
seem redundant or irrelevant; and the importance of flat and flexible
organisation structures which foster collaboration between people of diverse
disciplines and ways of thinking.
To the western mind trained to seek maximum simplicity, this may all seem
like theoretical overload. It is not. By combining psychological analysis
with practical managerial research, the two academics paint a vivid picture
of the complexities of life inside vibrant, creative organisational systems
of the kind that more western company must become if they are to survive in
the knowledge society.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Intimate PC aims to fill in the blanks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW DERRINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the 21st century we will carry tiny computers with us everywhere we go.
Mr Mik Lamming of Rank Xerox Research Centre in Cambridge told the British
Association how these 'intimate computers' might be programmed to help
locate those missing bits of information that we can spend hours looking
for.
Mr Lamming was speaking about a research project called Forget-me-not. The
Forget-me-not, a hand-held portable computer, is programmed to remember
everything a user does. When the user can only recall part of the
information they need, the computer will be able to supply the missing
pieces.
At present the Forget-me-not monitors where its user is, what telephone
calls they make and receive, and what messages they send by electronic mail.
It also monitors what files are passed from one Forget-me-not to another.
The position of the user is monitored using wireless transceivers in
different rooms in the research centre.
The researchers are investigating how other information could be collected
by the Forget-me-not.
Information about what the user does at work could easily be collected.
Information about the television programmes watched at home would also be
easy to record. But storing information is only the beginning of the
problem.
It will be some years before we will be able to tell whether it will be
easier to get information from the Forget-me-not than from our own memory.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Visible trade deficit beats City hopes with fall to Pounds
690m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's merchandise trade deficit with the rest of the world narrowed in
June as exports and imports rose to record levels.
The visible trade deficit fell to an estimated, seasonally adjusted Pounds
690m in June from Pounds 1,045m in May, the Central Statistical Office
reported yesterday. Exports rose in value by 3 1/2 per cent over the month
to Pounds 11.35bn while imports grew less rapidly by  1/2 per cent to Pounds
12.04bn.
The June deficit was well below the City's consensus forecast of Pounds 800m
but the figures had little initial impact on financial markets. The May
deficit was revised upwards slightly from the Pounds 1,032m shortfall
published last month.
Although the monthly trade figures are notoriously erratic, the CSO said
that its est-imates of the trend showed a narrowing of the deficit.
The news was hailed by City analysts as a sign that Britain appears so far
to be escaping a deterioration of its trade position in spite of the
apparent strengthening of its two-year-old economic recovery.
Taking three-month figures, which the government regards as a better guide,
exports rose in value by 4 per cent between the first and the second
quarters of this year and were 13 per cent higher in the three months to the
end of June compared with the same period in 1993.
Imports rose in value by 2 1/2 per cent and 8 1/2 per cent respectively.
The CSO's seasonally adjusted figures for volume trade, excluding oil and
erratic items such as ships, aircraft, precious stones and silver, showed a
2 1/2 per cent increase for exports and unchanged imports in the latest
three months compared with the first quarter.
Volume exports, excluding oil and erratics, were up 10 per cent compared
with the year before, while import volumes were 7 per cent higher.
The figures showed strong export growth to other members of the European
Union, producing a drop in the UK's deficit on trade with the EU to an
estimated Pounds 298m in June from Pounds 390m in May. The May figure was
revised upwards from the Pounds 377m deficit published last month.
Exports to the EU rose 3.6 per cent to Pounds 6.03bn in June from May while
imports advanced by 1.9 per cent to Pounds 6.33bn. UK exports to EU
countries grew more rapidly than those to the rest of the world between the
first and second quarters although North America continued to be a buoyant
market for British goods.
Exports to Germany, France and the Benelux countries rose respectively by 5
1/2 per cent, 7 per cent and 6 per cent between the first and second
quarters while UK exports to North America were up by 6 1/2 per cent in the
period.
Britain's surplus on trade in oil improved sharply to Pounds 491m in June
from Pounds 398m in May as export volumes and prices rose. The surplus on
oil rose from Pounds 900m in the first quarter to Pounds 1.3bn in the three
months to June, its highest level since the first quarter of 1986.
Analysts said the strong growth in UK export volumes reflected the economic
recovery in continental Europe as well as the benefits of a low pound and
spare productive capacity at home.
However, the improvement in volumes was partly offset by a deterioration in
Britain's terms of trade. While the unit value indices for UK exports
increased by 1 1/2 per cent in the three months to June, higher commodity
prices boosted the unit values of imports by 3 per cent.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Speech computer offers new hope
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW DERRINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A consortium of European universities and companies is developing a device
that will enable people who cannot talk to hold a natural-sounding
conversation by using speech synthesized by a computer.
Two prototypes are already under test. The consortium is confident that a
working device will be available within 2 1/2 years, said Dr Iain Murray of
Dundee University, a consortium member who spoke at the British Association
science festival in Loughborough yesterday.
Aids for disabled people form an important and growing market for talking
computers. Machines that convert text into speech for blind people and
generate speech for the voiceless are the main applications.
The new device is based on a portable computer and a speech synthesizer. It
has special software that allows the user to generate speech at normal
conversational speeds, and to make the speech sound more natural by
including inflections like those that signal the emotion and meaning in
normal speech.
In order to generate speech faster than it could be typed in, the device
will take advantage of the fact that much of the content of natural speech
is predictable.
By analysing the user's normal speech patterns, and by analysing what he has
just said, the machine will be able to make a small number of guesses about
what the user is likely to say, and present him with a set of choices on the
screen.
'For example,' Dr Murray said, 'it will know that if the person has just
said 'Hello' he is quite likely to say the name of one of his friends.' It
will have learned the names of his friends, and other things he is likely to
say, by analysing his past speech and will include them among the choices
that it gives him.'
Because each choice made by the user generates a word, or even a whole
phrase, commands to generate speech can be issued rapidly enough to maintain
a natural conversation with a human listener.
The device will also analyse the emotional content of the speech it is about
to generate, and vary the intonation and the pitch.
With the new device, it will be possible to use a computer to speak on your
behalf within three years. Speaking to a computer is much further away.
Progress is being made in recognising speech, that is in converting the
sounds into words. Understanding what the words mean is much more difficult,
according to Dr Murray.
The most successful word recognition systems recognise single words with an
accuracy of between 60 and 99 per cent. Extracting the words from a stream
of continuous speech is not yet possible, Dr Murray said.
Recognition of single words is good enough for applications where only a
limited number of words need to be used. Systems that handle simple travel
inquiries are already in use.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Controls urged on forensic 'cowboys'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW DERRINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anybody can act as an expert witness and give forensic evidence, provided
they can convince a court of their expertise, Ms Christine Willmore, a
lawyer from Bristol University told the meeting.
Dr Janet Thompson, director-general of the Forensic Science Service, said
there was no way to prevent 'cowboy' forensic scientists from acting as
expert witnesses.
What is needed, according to Dr Angela Gallop, a forensic adviser, is 'a
proper statutory body with teeth' that will accredit expert witnesses to
deal with particular areas of evidence.
Dr Gallop said people are setting themselves up as expert witnesses to give
evidence on areas that they do not really understand, and many courtroom
disagreements between expert witnesses are the result of lack of experience.
The only way to become expert in a particular area is to spend years working
in a forensic laboratory, she said. One problem is the need for both
prosecution and defence solicitors to keep costs down.
Dr Thompson said discussions had been going on for 2 1/2 years to establish
a voluntary accreditation scheme for forensic science laboratories, and
National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) that will recognise the competence
of expert witnesses.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Retail sales growth slows again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The annual rate of growth of retail sales in Britain slowed in August for
the second month in succession, the Confederation of British Industry said
yesterday, fostering hopes that the Treasury and Bank of England will delay
any planned increase in UK bank base rates.
The CBI said its latest survey of 449 companies with 15,000 outlets in the
retail, wholesale and motor trades came up with the slowest year-on-year
rate of growth for high-street sales since retailers first reported rising
volumes in January 1993.
The poll, which covered 266 retailers between August 16 and September 1,
found 31 per cent reporting a sales increase compared with a year ago, 29
per cent a decrease, and 39 per cent no change. The resulting positive
balance of 2 per cent, which the CBI considers indicative of the trend, was
lower than July's positive balance of 12 per cent and June's 27 per cent.
It also confounded expectations the previous month that August would see a
sharper increase in sales. The CBI reported that 30 per cent of retailers
found sales poor for the time of year compared with only 15 per cent saying
they were good. On balance, retailers cut employment in August compared with
the year before and plan further cuts.
Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel, said
the slowdown 'was perhaps not surprising' because sales grew strongly in
August last year. But he said retailers had been unable to raise prices as
much as they expected, indicating tough competitive conditions.
While retailers struggled, the 123 wholesalers surveyed reported a strong
increase in sales volumes in the year to August and sales well above average
for the time of year.
Wholesalers have been performing well since the late spring of last year.
Although they supply goods directly to institutions such as schools,
hospitals and local authorities, they are becoming increasingly independent
of the retail trade. But the wholesalers' strong trading performance did not
prevent a fall in employment in the year to August and expectations of a
further drop this month. Wholesalers also expect to cut investment slightly
in the months ahead.
Although the motor trades reported an increase in sales in the year to
August, the positive balance of 9 per cent was much less than expected.
Motor traders reported their second poorest sales performance this year. The
modest increase in volumes largely reflected increased sales of parts and
accessories.
In spite of generally disappointing results, most retail sectors reported
annual growth in sales, with off-licensees reporting the strongest volume
increases for the third month running. Mail-order houses and large multiple
outlets continued to do better than small multiple and single outlets, which
reported sales virtually flat in the year to August.
All three distributive trades expect business to improve over the next three
months. But Mr Whittaker said expectations have not been fully realised in
the last two surveys.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Lasers can clean dirty buildings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lasers can clean the dirty faces of old buildings more effectively than the
conventional methods of blasting with abrasive powder or high-pressure
water, the British Association meeting heard.
Although building conservators have been talking for 20 years about using
lasers to remove industrial grime, practical and affordable systems are only
now coming into use, said Mr John Larson of National Museums and Galleries
on Merseyside. He heads the first UK project to develop a laser for cleaning
buildings and sculpture.
The system has been tested successfully on patches of delicate stone carving
on Lincoln and Salisbury cathedrals and on the terracotta exterior of the
Henry Cole wing at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The V&amp;A now
plans to raise money from the Millennium Fund to clean the whole Henry Cole
wing by laser.
Lasers have been used more extensively in Italy and France, including
cleaning the whole front of Amiens cathedral.
The crust of dirt on stone or other material 'absorbs laser energy, which
swells the dirt, lifts it off the surface and partly vaporises it,' Mr
Larson said. 'When the laser reaches the clean surface, all the energy is
reflected back and the conservator can rely on it not to remove any more
material.'
That is one advantage over conventional abrasive techniques, which are
liable to remove some undamaged material with the dirt, according to Mr
Larson. Another is that it avoids the creation of large amounts of mess and
debris.
National Museums and Galleries on Merseyside is negotiating with an unnamed
American company to commercialise the system. Each one is likely to cost in
the region of Pounds 25,000 to Pounds 30,000.
As Mr Larson pointed out, it would be an unusual step for a public museum to
develop a product in this way in collaboration with the private sector. 'Our
trustees are very keen to go ahead - and at the same time nervous about it,'
he said.
He and his colleagues are also working on an ultra-violet laser for cleaning
and removing varnish from paintings.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Parker's alto sax sells for Pounds 93,500
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The saxophone played by Charlie 'Bird' Parker at the 'Quintet of the Year'
concert in Massey Hall, Toronto, in 1953 sold for Pounds 93,500 yesterday at
Christie's, South Kensington.
The alto sax, made of plastic by Grafton of London, tripled its estimate. It
was bought by Mr Emanuel Cleaver, mayor of Kansas City, which is creating a
jazz museum. Parker, who was born in Kansas City, died in 1955 at the age of
35 after long addiction to drink and drugs.
It was the first time an auction house had offered a large collection of
memorabilia linked to a jazz star, and the 83 lots, sent for sale by
Parker's last partner, Chan, sold well above estimate for Pounds 206,657.
Among the keenest buyers for mementos of the hard-living pioneer of bebop
was Hard Rock Cafe which paid Pounds 4,400 for Parker's autograph
arrangement of the song 'Summertime' and Pounds 2,420 for his driving
licence.
The auction totalled Pounds 408,852, a record for a Christie's pop
memorabilia sale. A bass drumskin used by and inscribed by the Beatles sold
for Pounds 11,500 while a black satin bustier worn by Madonna on her 'Who's
That Girl' tour was comfortably on target, fetching Pounds 4,400.
The Ivy League-style cardigan worn by Barbra Streisand in the movie 'The Way
We Were' was right at the bottom of its estimate at Pounds 2,200.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Snake venom may lead to new drugs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Venom from a deadly African snake, the green mamba, could lead to new drugs
to treat brain disorders, the British Association meeting was told.
Professor Alan Harvey of Strathclyde University's Institute for Drug
Research described his work on dendrotoxin, an extremely potent nerve poison
extracted from mamba venom.
Dendrotoxin selectively blocks 'potassium channels' that are an essential
part of the signalling mechanism in nerve cells. The Strathclyde scientists
are developing small molecules based on dendrotoxin with the aim of boosting
the activity of certain chemical pathways that are damaged by progressive
brain diseases.
'Although dendrotoxin-like compounds would not be a cure for these diseases,
they may provide temporary relief from symptoms,' Prof Harvey said.
Conversely, compounds designed to have the opposite effect of activating
rather than blocking potassium channels 'may be a novel way of reducing
abnormal electrical activity in the brain,' he said. 'Hence they may form
the basis of a new type of anti-convulsant drug for epileptics.'
Prof Harvey said that in addition to the Strathclyde research he knew of two
drug companies working independently on dendrotoxins.
If the research leads successfully to a drug - which would take several
years - mamba venom would not be the first natural poison developed for the
benefit of human health.
Curare, the South American arrow poison, led to several muscle relaxant
drugs. Venom from the Brazilian arrowhead viper led to a range of drugs,
known as ACE inhibitors, which have been introduced over the past 10 years
to reduce blood pressure in heart patients.

FT  09 SEP 94 / New index of mortgage lending shows 3% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A slightly brighter picture of the UK housing market was painted yesterday
as a new mortgage lending index showed a rise in advances of more than 3 per
cent last month compared with July.
The first publication of the Barclays Bank index shows that mortgage lending
rose 3.3 per cent in August compared with July, and was 4.7 per cent higher
than in August last year.
The index, which deals with mortgage advances from a wide range of lenders,
is based on the volume of mortgage transactions flowing through the accounts
of solicitors who bank with Barclays. The bank has a market share of about
30 per cent of all solicitors' accounts.
Mr Garry Skelton, head of Barclays mortgages, said that the bank had tracked
the index privately against the monthly lending statistics produced by the
Bank of England for almost two years, and had found a very close correlation
between the two sets of figures.
As well as coming ahead of the official figures, the Barclays index can
produce indicators for different regions in England and Wales.
For August these suggested that the region with the greatest increase in
activity was north-west England, followed by East Anglia.
The most marked decline in mortgage lending, according to the index, was in
southern England. There was a 9.6 per cent drop in August compared with
July.
A more encouraging gloss on the housing market in the south-east came ,
however, from Woolwich Building Society, the UK's third-largest society.
Mr Peter Robinson, Woolwich managing director, said he believed the house
prices survey published by Halifax Building Society, the UK's largest
mortgage lender, underestimated growth in southern England, where Woolwich
has most of its branches.
Halifax reported that house prices fell by 0.7 per cent last month.

FT  09 SEP 94 / CBI chief launches attack on Treasury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Howard Davies, director general of the Confederation of British Industry,
last night launched an extraordinary attack on the Treasury for allegedly
attempting to undermine the government's competitiveness white paper
produced earlier this year by the Department of Trade and Industry.
Speaking at the annual dinner of the Scottish CBI in Glasgow, Mr Davies said
that the white paper 'demonstrated the need for business advice and support
services both at home and abroad, at least as good as those available to
companies in competitor countries'. That meant upgrading the services for
small businesses at home and export support activity abroad.
'Yet the ink was scarcely dry on the competitiveness white paper setting out
this strategy, and offering business a new partnership with government,
before the Treasury began to throw the basis of the policy into question,'
he said.
It is understood that Mr Davies was referring to the plans of Mr Michael
Portillo, the former Treasury chief secretary, to slash the DTI budget.
These plans, when leaked during the summer, caused a major political row,
not least because Mr Portillo appeared to be talking down to Mr Michael
Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary.
Last night Mr Heseltine was in Glasgow to hear Mr Davies savage his
tormentors. He refused to be drawn, saying he was confident that the white
paper represented the policy of the whole government.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Computerised speech enhanced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW DERRINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A computer that will enable people who cannot speak to talk in a
human-sounding voice - with emotion and at a natural speed - is being
developed by a consortium of European universities and companies.
Two prototype devices are under test and the consortium is confident that a
working device will be available within 2 1/2 years, Dr Iain Murray of
Dundee University said at the British Association science festival in
Loughborough yesterday.
Talking machines have been available for many years, and speech has been
added to a number of consumer products. Dr Murray said that had been done
mostly in the form of 'consumer gimmicks'.
Aids for disabled people form an important and growing market for talking
computers - especially machines that convert text into speech for the blind
and generate speech for the voiceless.
The quality of the speech synthesised by computers is improving rapidly. The
rules for converting from text to speech are complex, and are different for
every language.
The new machine relies on recent work that makes synthetic speech more
natural by adding variations in pitch and voice quality which resemble those
produced by a human speaker.
A module that adds emotion effects to synthetic speech, developed by Dr
Murray, is an important part of the system.
The most important feature of the new device is that it will include special
software components to enable disabled users to generate speech at normal
conversational speeds. That would be impossible if text had to be typed in
word by word.
One component - predictive active lexicon, licensed to Lander Software of
Glasgow - learns what words the user is likely to say in a given context.
The other - called Talk: About and marketed by Don Johnson of Chicago -
predicts what phrases are likely to occur. Commands to generate speech can
be issued rapidly enough to maintain a natural conversation.
With the new device, it will be possible within three years to use a
computer to speak on behalf of an individual. Speaking to a computer is much
further away. Progress is being made in recognising speech - that is in
converting the sounds into words. Understanding what the words mean is much
more difficult, said Dr Murray.
The most successful word recognition systems recognise single words with an
accuracy between 60 per cent and 99 per cent. Extracting the words from a
stream of continuous speech is not yet possible, said Dr Murray.
Recognition of single words is good enough for applications in which only a
limited number of words needs to be used. Systems that handle simple travel
enquiries are already in use.
Dr Murray said the prospect of holding a conversation with a computer was
probably 20 years away.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Minister spells out vision for science
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Hunt, science minister, spelled out his 'vision to move science,
engineering and technology into the mainstream of our education system, our
culture and our public debate' to the British Association yesterday.
He emphasised the need for scientists to communicate better and announced
grants worth a total of Pounds 375,000 to promote public understanding -
Pounds 150,000 for the Royal Society's Committee on the Public Understanding
of Science, Pounds 140,000 for the British Association to organise a
National Week of Science next year, and Pounds 85,000 for a Science Museum
mobile exhibition on 'the information superhighway'.
Mr Hunt promised that he would make use of his position as Chancellor of the
Duchy of Lancaster - and chairman of several key cabinet economic committees
 -'to keep science at the heart of government'.
He was cautiously optimistic about the prospects for an increase in the
government science budget when next year's public spending plans are
announced at the end of November.
The prime minister's statement early this year that science would be a high
priority for future funding 'is going to be very helpful' in the coming
round of public expenditure negotiations, Mr Hunt said.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Lord Young left with a face to match his bright red bow tie
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The phone hype of the year began at 6.30am yesterday morning. Lord Young
scooped four minutes live on BBC Radio Four's 'Today' programme to claim
that Mercury One-2-One, the mobile phone company run by his Cable &amp; Wireless
group, was taking British Telecommunications to the cleaners.
One-2-One's 'inside option' would appeal to 'everyone who wants to save
money', enthused Lord Young. 'We are the cheapest of all and this is making
us now, on this tariff from home, cheaper than BT.'
By 9am Lord Young, sporting a bright red bow tie, was before the media
unwrapping a huge parcel for One-2-One's first birthday. Out came placards
proclaiming that One-2-One 'inside' was 25 per cent cheaper than BT for
daytime local calls, 15 per cent cheaper for national calls, and 10 per cent
cheaper on international calls.
'Today we've done it again with a mobile-phone service that's cheaper than
BT for daytime calls made from the workplace,' said Lord Young.
Then came the details. The service is available only in the London area.
Calls qualify for the 'inside' tariff only if made from a single designated
'home cell' little more than the area of a building. Stray 'outside' and the
price of a daytime local call escalates nearly fivefold.
'It looks like a mobile phone for stationary people,' quipped Cellnet, one
of the three other mobile-phone operators. Vodafone and Orange reacted
similarly.
Over lunch came rumours that One-2-One phones do not work inside some
buildings. 'Different buildings behave in different ways,' confessed a press
officer. 'In some buildings the phones do not work adequately.' Apparently
it is all to do with steel and frequencies.
After lunch was the number-crunching which put the One-2-One 'savings' in
perspective.
The rental for a One-2-One line is Pounds 67.47 a quarter - against Pounds
32.66 for a BT business line. The handset costs at least Pounds 200. And for
all calls made in the evenings and at weekends, BT is far cheaper than
One-2-One 'inside' - let alone outside.
Even in the daytime, callers who are frequent BT users can get 14 per cent
or more off standard tariffs for a payment of Pounds 2.17 a month. Only
local calls are then cheaper with One-2-One for a three-minute chat.
Bargain hunters will be on tenterhooks for Lord Young's next birthday treat
for One-2-One.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Probe demanded into rail 'near-miss'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The RMT transport union and the Aslef train drivers' union yesterday called
for an urgent inquiry into a 'near-miss' in which two cars crossed a
Derbyshire level crossing moments before an oncoming passenger train during
the 16th strike by signal workers.
Railtrack claimed that 57 per cent of the network was open yesterday. But Mr
Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said that no more than 31 per cent of
trains were running.
The two cars went over the railway line at Sawley in Derbyshire because the
automatic barriers preventing vehicles from crossing busy lines were raised.
Railtrack said maintenance contractors were working at the site when the
incident occurred. The contractors have been asked to conduct their own
inquiries, Railtrack said. Aslef said workers should have stood at the
crossing with hand-held signals to control cars and trains, but none were
present.
The driver of the 11.18am Crewe-Nottingham train was given the green signal
to cross the line at 12.44pm but said he saw two cars going over the line in
front of him.
Railtrack said there was no link between the incident and the strike. It
would not say whether the nearest signal box was operated by a manager.
In another incident yesterday the back wheels of a commuter train were
derailed in Kent. Passengers were evacuated from the 5.53pm train from
London Blackfriars to Sevenoaks at Bickley, but police said there were no
injuries.
Railtrack said of the derailment that 'the indication is that there is not
any connection with the signal strike', while British Rail said it was the
subject of an investigation and could not comment on the possible cause.
Mr Knapp said the Sawton near-accident was 'the kind of incident we have
been warning could happen'.
Mr Lew Adams, Aslef general secretary, said he would be writing to the chief
inspector of railways about the Kent derailment, and warned that signal
boxes staffed by strike-breaking workers increased the risk to his union
members and the public.
He said he wanted to know the number of dangerous incidents and signals
passed at danger during the 16 strike days.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Italian subsidies anger unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two trade unions in the North Sea oil industry are complaining to the
European Commission over what they believe to be the unlawful use of Pounds
147m-worth of subsidies by the Italian government to aid oil-production
facilities.
They are also seeking an urgent meeting with the Department of Trade and
Industry over the construction of the Spirit of Columbus floating production
facilities at the Fincantieri yard in Genoa for Sana, the Italian subsidiary
of Midland and Scottish Resources based in Aberdeen.
Officials from the AEEU engineering and electrical union and the GMB general
union released a letter from Mr Karel Van Miert, the EU commissioner, dated
July 29. In it Mr Van Miert suggested that the Italian authorities had
provided only Pounds 22m of the Pounds 173m production costs for the
building of the Spirit of Columbus.
But the unions pointed out yesterday - on the evidence of the company's
annual return for 1993 - that as much as Pounds 147m had been 'funded by
subsidies received or receivable from the Italian government' - about 60 per
cent of its production costs, not the 12.7 per cent claimed by Mr Van Miert.
The unions said Britain might have expected to secure 80 per cent of the
work for building facilities for the North Sea oil industry. But they warned
that the growth in floating facilities production and falling requirements
for more fixed platforms could lead to a loss of business to yards abroad.
They said: 'We need to have a thorough investigation into what was agreed
through the EU as state aid on the Spirit of Columbus. If the Pounds 147m is
not legal then immediate action should be taken. If this kind of subsidy is
legal then the UK government will have to ensure our industry is not
disadvantaged and similar state aid is made available here.'

RMT transport union leader Jimmy Knapp led a protest march in Blackpool
yesterday as rail signal workers held their 16th strike day. He said only a
third of services were running and accused Railtrack of trying to
'intimidate' the signal workers. Railtrack said 57 per cent of the network

FT  09 SEP 94 / CBI may shift on EU social policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, is to meet Mr John Monks, TUC
general secretary, later this month in a move which could lead to a
significant shift in the CBI's attitude to the European Union's agenda on
social affairs.
Many larger members of the Confederation of British Industry with interests
in mainland Europe believe the organisation cannot afford to sit on the
sidelines as others decide on EU social policy that affects them.
The two men intend to search for common ground that would enable the CBI to
participate fully in the 'social dialogue' approach in Brussels on
employment issues.
The social dialogue approach is being developed with the encouragement of
the European Commission by Unice, the European employers' federation, and
the ETUC union federation.
The social dialogue approach involves negotiation between employers and
unions at EU level of framework agreements as an alternative to the
imposition of legally enforceable directives.
The CBI was involved earlier this year in an attempt to negotiate a
framework agreement on European works councils, but pulled out of the Unice
negotiating team as a result of pressure from its smaller and medium-sized
members.
A growing number of the CBI's large affiliates want the organisation to take
part in European decision-making in spite of the government's opt-out from
the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty.
Mr Jacques Santer, the new EU president, is to speak at the CBI's annual
conference this autumn.
Some CBI officials say they are not opposed in principle to involvement in
the social dialogue at European level. They do not believe this would
conflict either with British employment law or the industrial relations
system.
But the CBI would like to see a much longer timetable than at present for
considering issues under the social dialogue, which now involves a process
of two periods of six weeks within three months to reach agreement.
Union leaders are willing to try to reach agreement with the CBI on European
social issues. Mr Bill Jordan, the AEEU engineering union president, who is
due to speak at the CBI's conference this autumn, has invited the CBI to
discuss with the TUC a framework agreement on life-long training.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Pounds 10,000 cash withdrawal revealed in Archer share case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Broosk Saib, the beneficiary of profits earned on Anglia share deals
arranged by Lord Archer, withdrew Pounds 10,000 in cash shortly after
receiving the proceeds of just over Pounds 77,000 from the transactions.
The Department of Trade and Industry inspectors who carried out an
investigation into alleged insider share dealing in Anglia shares were told
that Mr Saib deposited the Pounds 77,000 cheque in his National Westminster
Bank account at west London's Cromwell Road branch on February 10.
The deposit was made at almost the same time as the appointment by the DTI
of inspectors to investigate the transactions for possible breaches of
insider dealing law. The government had been informed by the Stock Exchange
of Lord Archer's Anglia share dealing orders only days after they took place
in mid January.
The cheque for the dealing profit was 'account payee only' and was drawn on
the Bank of Scotland account of broker Charles Stanley, which bought and
sold 50,000 Anglia shares for Mr Saib's benefit on the instructions of Lord
Archer.
Mr Saib already had a current account at the Cromwell Road branch. However,
he opened a Premium Reserve interest-paying account, into which he
transferred just over Pounds 50,000 of the proceeds.
The inspectors also learned that in February and March there were three
significant withdrawals from Mr Saib's NatWest account: there were payments
to external accounts of Pounds 10,000 and Pounds 12,000, plus a cash
withdrawal of Pounds 10,000.
The external accounts which received the payments belonged to 'individuals
or organisations' unconnected to Lord Archer, according to an official with
a close knowledge of the DTI investigation.
The cheque for just over Pounds 77,000 was posted to Lord Archer's London
address on February 4. The profit stemmed from the purchase and sale of
50,000 Anglia shares over four working days in mid January. The shares were
bought at 485p and sold at 646p.
The shares were sold on the day MAI announced a takeover bid for Anglia, of
which Lady Archer is a director. Lord Archer has told the DTI inspectors
that he did not profit from inside information.
The former Conservative party deputy chairman is travelling abroad and,
according to a friend, may not return to the UK until the end of the month.
The DTI has decided not to take any action against Lord Archer, having
received the inspectors' report. Labour yesterday stepped up pressure on Mr
Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to publish the report.
Mr Derek Fatchett, Labour's industry spokesman, rejected Mr Heseltine's
assertion last week that the Financial Services Act gave him 'no power' to
publish the report.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Public-sector pay bill registers its lowest rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The public-sector pay bill rose just 1 per cent last year, the lowest annual
increase since records began in 1954, figures released yesterday in the
Central Statistical Office's National Income and Expenditure Blue Book show.
While the pay bill increased markedly less than the previous year's rise of
7.5 per cent, it was achieved at the expense of large-scale job cuts.
Numbers employed in the public sector fell 327,000 between mid-1992 and
mid-1993.
The 1 per cent rise last year also disguised an increase in average earnings
per head in the public sector of 7 per cent. This suggested that bonuses and
other increments are having an increasingly significant impact on overall
increases in pay.
An analysis of the figures by the Public Finance Foundation of the Chartered
Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy showed that last year's increase
in the total bill was well within the 1.5 per cent target ceiling set when
the government announced its wage policy in November 1992.
The combined pay bill for local and central government and public
corporations was Pounds 93.55bn last year compared with Pounds 92.64bn in
the previous year.
The institute notes that the average individual public-sector average pay
rise of 7 per cent last year was considerably more than the private-sector
rise over the same period of 4.3 per cent.
The figures show that while the pay policy was holding back basic pay rises,
real earnings were rising to a much greater degree than might have been
expected, the institute said.
Mr Chris Trinder, research director, said: 'The 1.5 per cent wage settlement
policy did not succeed in preventing considerable earnings drift in the
public sector.'
He added: 'Basic wage rates are becoming less important as a determinant of
total earning increases. Perhaps this is why the policy met with so little
opposition - because living standards for those who kept their jobs were
still being protected.'
The figures also showed that average earnings per head in the public sector
continued to stay ahead of those in the private sector from the beginning of
1991 to the end of last year. Average public-sector earnings per head were
Pounds 17,093 last year compared with Pounds 13,280 in the private sector.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Earthmovers take over from explosives: Jimmy Burns sees the
'unarmed struggle' on the Irish border
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was the smallest of streams - a burn not more than a foot wide. Yet in
the context of Northern Ireland's turbulent politics, it had momentarily
achieved near-biblical proportions.
The stream, which passes under a country road seven miles from Londonderry,
separates north and south Ireland. Early this week the spot was chosen by
republicans to demonstrate what they now call the 'unarmed phase of the
struggle' for Irish unity.
At around 5pm, republicans in cars and vans met local farmers and builders
with farming and earth-moving equipment on the north side of the border.
The fittest among them began with the help of a bulldozer to move a series
of small concrete bollards blocking the road into nearby fields.
Then they moved down the road towards the south and tried to move some
larger blocks which marked the border.
When they failed they laid a temporary road to one side of the blocks so
that vehicles could cross the border.
The barriers were set up by the security forces during the 1970s to stop
terrorists using isolated roads to cross the border. Although occasionally
inspected by army patrols, they never became permanent checkpoints.
But following last week's ceasefire announcement by the IRA, they have
become the target of political action.
Sinn Fein officials in Londonderry see the removal of the barriers as part
of the demilitarisation process and, more importantly, a symbol of their
commitment to Irish unity. They do not accept that removing them without the
consent of the security forces is illegal.
So far the removal of the barriers has been carried out in an air of
celebration rather than confrontation, although tension has never been far
beneath the surface.
Near the stream, the demonstrators - men, women and children - laughed as
the oldest republican present, former Sinn Fein councillor Barney McFadden,
cut a makeshift tape of kitchen towelling and declared the border crossing
permanently opened.
'Tell me, Patrick, is the grass greener now on the other side?' joked one
republican to another as demonstrators stepped from north to south and back
again.
The security forces were not present. They have been replacing the barriers
 -in the early hours of the morning, after the demonstrators have left.
Nevertheless the border 'opening' I witnessed had been kept secret until the
last minute, and to attend it I had to be accompanied by a Sinn Fein member.
The good humour gave way to defiance when some of the demonstrators were
intercepted later by a heavily armed Ulster police patrol and subjected to
intensive document checks.
Neither the barriers nor the checks had 'absolutely any justification,' said
Mr Martin McGuinness, Londonderry's most prominent republican figure, who is
believed to have played a key role in ensuring the acceptance of the IRA
ceasefire.
Mr McGuinness himself called for checkpoints to be removed together with the
'other paraphernalia of war' in and around 'one of the most heavily
garrisoned cities in the world'. The security presence in the area includes
heavily fortified police and army barracks and watchtowers with long-range
camera equipment.
The republican 'unarmed struggle' is being watched nervously, however, not
just by the security forces but by the Protestant community.
For a people to whom history often seems like only yesterday, the current
campaign of civil action - including picketing police stations in protest at
alleged harassment of Catholics by security forces - is reminiscent of the
early stages of the conflict.
Republican sources insist the IRA ceasefire has been agreed to in a
time-frame generous enough to allow for genuine political and constitutional
progress to be made in the framework of the current Anglo-Irish peace
process.
But no republican I talked to in Londonderry would guarantee that military
operations had ended for ever. Several insisted the ceasefire would hold as
long as the government responded by taking more than just cosmetic steps to
demilitarisation in Catholic areas.
Their demands range from a withdrawal of army patrols to the gradual
introduction in Catholic areas of a reformed and retrained police force,
which is still regarded as sectarian. Beyond this, there is the sine qua non
of political concession.
Down on the Bogside, there is a freshly-painted mural. It shows a British
soldier carrying the Union Jack on his back and walking off down a country
road - a road clearly signposted to London.

FT  09 SEP 94 / MPs say aid for renewable energy gives poor value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's Pounds 340m of subsidies for renewable energy programmes,
such as wind power and 'hot rocks', has been attacked as poor value by a
cross-party committee of MPs.
The Commons public accounts committee said yesterday: 'It is very doubtful
that the relatively modest increases in new electricity generation justify
the large sums spent.'
The report accepts that the programme has yielded useful information about
green power, and supports the UK's international obligation to develop clean
power sources. But it expresses reservations about the value of the
subsidies administered by the Department of Trade and Industry, which will
rise to Pounds 150m a year.
The subsidies are made through the non-fossil fuel obligation, an official
programme which obliges electricity companies to buy a proportion of their
power from sources other than coal, oil and gas. The extra cost is covered
by a levy on domestic electricity bills.
The report points out that fewer than half the projects approved in the
first two rounds of subsidies are actually producing electricity; half the
projects in the second round may never start at all because they have been
blocked by local planning objections, for example in the case of wind farms.
The MPs say they are 'disappointed' that in spite of Pounds 54m being spent
on wind energy programmes, 84 per cent of installed wind turbine capacity in
the UK is provided by foreign manufacturers.
The report also attacks subsidies for 'hot rocks' - drawing heat from deep
in the earth. Even though Pounds 40m has been spent on this programme, there
is no technology capable of exploiting this resource at a reasonable cost in
the foreseeable future.
Targets for reducing carbon dioxide emissions can be achieved without
expanding the nuclear power industry to replace coal-fired power stations,
the Association of Nuclear-free Local Authorities says in a submission to
the government's nuclear review. The submission was prepared for the
association by Cambridge Econometrics.

Cornwall County Council should remain intact when local government is
reorganised, the Local Government Commission for England recommended
yesterday.
Its favourite option is to leave the two-tier system with a county council
and six districts. As alternatives, it suggests one all-purpose authority
for the county, or keeping the two-tier system but merging the districts
into three.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Scottish survey figures amended
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The result of a survey which showed an alarming drop in the value of
electronic components which companies in Scotland obtain from local sources
has been amended following further analysis.
The original survey said the Scottish electronics industry obtained 5 per
cent of its material inputs from Scotland in 1994, compared with 12 per cent
in 1992, in spite of a 16 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 9bn.
Yesterday the Scottish Partnership in Electronics for Effective
Distribution, which lobbies for better transport links, said the correct
figure for 1994 material inputs from Scotland should have been 10 per cent.
The value of Scottish-sourced inputs rose from Pounds 590m in 1992 to Pounds
660m in 1994.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Right to vote 'denied to 2m'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 2m people in England and Wales are unable to vote because their
names do not appear on the electoral register, Mr Jack Straw, Labour's
shadow environment secretary, said yesterday.
He said it was estimated that one in five people in their early 20s and 24
per cent of black people were not on the register. He called on the
government to promote the right to vote, and to introduce a computerised
'rolling' register which would be updated throughout the year.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Financial advisers to campaign on costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new trade association for independent financial advisers was launched
yesterday, with the promise to campaign for its members on issues such as
rising regulatory costs, Alison Smith writes.
There has been concern among independent financial advisers that their
interests were in danger of being lost compared with the lobbying strength
of large life-insurance companies.
The IFA Association has been formed from the National Federation of
Independent Financial Advisers, which had about 2,000 members, and a further
1,200 advisers who were in the financial-services element of the British
Insurance and Investment Brokers' Association. It hopes to have about 4,000
members by the end of the year. Its chief executive is Mr Garry Heath,
formerly chief executive of the national federation.
The association will represent the sector's views to regulators, the
government and other organisations, such as consumer groups. Its first
campaigns will focus on the costs of regulation, arrangements for paying
compensation to customers who have suffered poor advice on pension
transfers, and the rising cost of professional indemnity insurance.
It will also highlight the potential threat to the widespread availability
of independent financial advice if hundreds of advisers do not apply to join
the Personal Investment Authority, the new regulator to protect the private
investor.

FT  09 SEP 94 / August jump in truck sales leaves new cars trailing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Registrations of new commercial vehicles were 19.9 per cent higher last
month than August last year, at 37,259. The rise was in contrast to sales of
new cars, which rose by only 2.8 per cent year-on-year.
The recovery in sales of vans, trucks and buses has spread to all sectors of
the market, including purchases by small businesses.
Sales of trucks in August, the most important month for sales of new
vehicles, jumped by 27.9 per cent to 6,282, with a particularly strong
increase in the sale of trucks for the construction sector and long-distance
haulage.
Commercial vehicle registrations are an important economic indicator, and
August sales were sharply higher than a year ago in most sectors, figures
from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show. Registrations of
light vans (up to 1.8 tonnes) rose 24.9 per cent to 11,136, while sales of
medium vans (1.81-3.5 tonnes) rose 16.3 per cent.
The pick-up in new-vehicle purchases by businesses was also reflected in
sales of new cars in August, with purchases by fleets (operating 25 or more
cars) rising by 18.2 per cent to 156,098.
In the first eight months fleet car sales rose by 16.1 per cent to 620,655.
Sales to private-car buyers, which had been growing by 10 per cent earlier
this year, fell by 4.4 per cent, in spite of a big marketing campaign.
Commercial vehicle registrations have risen strongly nearly every month this
year, ending four years of continuous decline from a peak of 371,104 in
1989.
Registrations fell by 2.1 per cent in the whole of last year to 197,067. In
the first eight months of this year registrations rose by 16.3 per cent to
157,368.
The recovery in the market has been accompanied by a surge in imports,
however, in particular of trucks and light vans. The share taken by imported
commercial vehicles in the first eight months jumped to 43.3 per cent from
40.8 per cent in the corresponding period a year ago.
The contraction of the UK truck industry has led to a surge in imports in
this sector with an increase of 52.8 per cent in an overall market that has
grown by 23.2 per cent.
Rover is to increase the prices of its cars, except for the 600 and 800
ranges, by an average of 1.7 per cent with effect from September 19. Most
carmakers, including market leaders Ford and Vauxhall, have already
announced price increases for this autumn.

FT  09 SEP 94 / PM fails to woo hardline sceptics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rightwing Conservative MPs yesterday gave a mixed response to Mr John
Major's speech on the future of the European Union, in which the prime
minister denounced calls by French and German politicians for the creation
of an 'inner core' of European states.
By taking a tough stand on Wednesday against a 'two-tier Europe,' Mr Major
impressed those Tory MPs who had feared that France and Germany were bidding
to dominate the European Union.
Mr Jim Cran, a prominent Euro-sceptic MP, said he was 'very pleased indeed'
that the prime minister was pressing home his call for a more flexible
European constitution in which member states could choose those parts of the
European Union project in which they wished to participate.
'I am getting more and more confident that the prime minister shares my
views,' he said, 'though I will wait to see how this is matched by deeds in
the run-up to the Inter-Governmental Conference (in 1996).'
However, other Tory right-wingers were far less impressed by the speech,
saying that the party's policy on Europe was now more confused than ever.
Mr Ian Duncan-Smith, one of the most Euro-sceptic MPs in the party, admitted
Mr Major had 'at long last recognised that there is powerful push for
central government inside the European community.' But the speech was 'too
little, too late,' the Maastricht treaty had already committed Europe to
moving in a highly centralised direction. 'Nothing short of rewriting the
Maastricht treaty and returning powers to national parliaments will convince
me that we are on the right course,' he said.
A Gallup poll in The Daily Telegraph today gives Labour another record lead
over the Tories. Labour support is unchanged from a month ago at 56.5 per
cent but the Conservatives have dropped one point to 22 per cent. Liberal
Democrat support was 17 per cent, compared with 14.5 per cent. The survey
was based on a sample of 1,045 voters.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Lawyers report fees upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recession in the legal profession seems to have bottomed out, a survey
of the top 100 solicitors' firms indicates.
The survey by Legal Business magazine shows gross revenues rose to Pounds
2.8bn in 1993-94 from Pounds 2.7bn the previous year. Many partners said the
first half of the year had proved as disappointing as 1992-3 but there had
been a marked upturn in activity in the second half. 'There is an air of
tentative optimism,' the survey says.
The most reliable indicator of firms' financial health is fees earned per
fee-earner, the magazine says. Linklaters &amp; Paines top this league table
with Pounds 209,000 per fee-earner followed by Ashurst Morris Crisp and
Freshfields (both Pounds 207,000), Allen &amp; Overy (Pounds 197,000) and
Slaughter and May (Pounds 195,000).
The table of profits per partner is topped by Allen &amp; Overy (Pounds
382,000), Slaughter &amp; May (Pounds 371,000), Linklaters (Pounds 350,000),
Ashurst Morris Crisp (Pounds 298,000) and Freshfields (Pounds 295,000).
The main factors affecting the financial health of firms were the type of
clients, cuts made in the recent past and the extent of any disproportionate
property costs.
There were more partners on the job market last year than ever before. This
was a product of some being 'shown the door' during the recession and
successful partners being lured elsewhere.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Two face satellite pirating charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two men have been remanded in custody charged with conspiracy to defraud
British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television venture, following a
police investigation into the alleged illegal sale of pirate satellite
decoding cards, Raymond Snoddy writes.
It is believed to be the first time the police have brought charges for such
an alleged offence. Until now BSkyB, in which Pearson, owners of the
Financial Times, has a stake, has used injunctions against alleged pirates.
Mr Paul Richard Bridgeman and Mr Najam Butt, both of Manchester, were
yesterday remanded in custody by Macclesfield magistrates for seven days.
They had first appeared before magistrates at Crewe on Saturday.
In an unrelated development News Datacom said it believed it had struck a
blow against pirates in Ireland and a system of avoiding payment called
Phoenix. The pirates have been claiming they can upgrade existing cards so
they can receive all the Sky channels for the price of the cheapest
subscription package.
News Datacom has changed its signal to disrupt Phoenix in the continuing
cat-and-mouse battle against the pirates.

FT  09 SEP 94 / US invasion of Haiti may come within four weeks: Pentagon
activates seven cargo ships for a military operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration is lining up its media forces to win public
support for an invasion of Haiti, now widely expected within a month unless
the country's military rulers step down.
The White House said yesterday its patience was 'wearing thin' and the
Pentagon announced that seven cargo ships were being activated for possible
use in a Haiti operation to restore Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's first
democratically elected president. Mr Aristide was ousted by a military coup
and exiled three years ago.
The US has suggested it would use massive force - about 10,000 troops - in
any intervention to keep down casualties.
'Patience is wearing thin,' said White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers. 'The
coup leaders' days are numbered. . . we are moving toward the endgame in
this policy,' she said.
President Bill Clinton is likely to avoid seeking a congressional vote to
back the invasion, but is understood to be planning a national address to
win popular backing for the first military offensive of his presidency.
Mr Clinton held a three-hour session on Wednesday night to consider invasion
plans with senior foreign policy advisers and White House staff. The meeting
was interpreted as a signal of renewed urgency in the administration to
restore democracy to Haiti.
The US government's stiffening resolve was made clear by Mr Warren
Christopher, secretary of state, who warned Haiti's military leadership
prior to the meeting that 'their days are definitely numbered. . . One way
or another, the de facto government is going to be leaving.'
Pentagon officials are understood to have informed the White House that a
US-led multinational force is ready to go, but the president needs to win
over the American people before launching an operation which could involve
US casualties.
White House assessments of the popular backing for a Haiti invasion are
likely to be the critical factor in deciding both when and if the
administration decides to act. Mr Clinton's advisers seem to be split on
possible public responses.
National security advisers are expected to start briefing Congress members
next week on the reasons for US involvement, the plans for a speedy
withdrawal and the outlook for a UN peacekeeping operation.
Seeking to avoid a vote would be a break with the Bush administration's
policy of winning congressional backing for US operations in the Gulf war.
However, it would have a recent precedent in the Reagan administration,
which began its invasion of Panama without a vote in Congress. 'Consult,
execute and then defend' is said to be the policy envisaged by the
administration.
Wednesday night's meeting also considered plans for a final push to persuade
Haiti's military leaders to step down.
This could involve covert action which would attempt to exacerbate rifts
between Haiti's military commanders and offers to provide safe passage for
Haiti's leaders.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Chile resumes its grand sell-off: David Pilling in Santiago
details the new state assets coming under the hammer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The minister was adamant. 'What business does the state have running an
airline? The devil can buy it, for all I care.'
The Chilean government is a little more discreet in public, but the
minister's remark is an eloquent reminder that Chilean state assets are
again going under the hammer.
The privatisation process, all but stalled under the four-year democratic
transition, has been revived by the new administration of President Eduardo
Frei, which has promised to 'open up opportunities for the private sector'
by selling off state companies on a 'case-by-case basis'.
Mr Frei says he does not share the 'simplistic notion. . . that the
modernisation of the state entails the stripping of all its power and
authority'. But private participation is to be encouraged in areas needing
'high levels of investment', or where, 'given a competitive market, the
private sector can operate more efficiently'.
Given new spending priorities - specifically a commitment gradually to raise
investment in education to 7 per cent of gross domestic product from 5 per
cent now - the government is keen to unload some of its spending burden on
to the private sector.
The process has already begun, albeit modestly, with the sale of 23.8 per
cent of Lan Chile airline for Dollars 10.8m (Pounds 6.9m). Over the coming
months, stakes in electricity, shipping and railway companies will be
auctioned off, swelling treasury coffers by some Dollars 200m.
'Today there is a different atmosphere surrounding the subject,' says Mr
Felipe Sandoval, head of Corporacion de Fomento (Corfo), the state holding
group. Attitudes about the role of the state, which once separated opponents
of the military regime from supporters, have begun to merge and the topic
has lost much ideological heat.
First on the privatisation list is Edelnor, the northern power utility. The
government will sell off its 48.5 per cent stake in stages, with 12-32 per
cent due to be divested this year. Mr Sandoval says each 12 per cent tranche
should be worth about Dollars 30m.
The government also intends to raise Dollars 50m of private sector funding
for Colbun, the state power utility, in need of investment capital. The full
privatisation of Colbun, valued at Dollars 400m, will be considered when the
government is satisfied that adequate anti-monopoly regulations are in
place, Mr Sandoval says.
Empremar and its container unit Transcontainer, which handle about 5 per
cent of overseas transport, are also to be sold, pending change of a law
restricting private ownership to 35 per cent. A previous attempt to sell the
loss-making company, estimated to be worth Dollars 20m, failed because of
lack of interest in taking on a minority stake.
Various Chilean groups, including forestry companies seeking cheaper access
to ports, will in October bid for 51 per cent of Ferrocarriles del Pacfico,
the railway cargo division. The winning company, which could pay up to
Dollars 100m, will inherit 90 locomotives and 5,000 wagons. It will rent use
of track from state railway company EFE.
Elsewhere the government is studying partial privatisation of the water and
sewerage systems, still inadequate in many districts, and expects to publish
recommendations in October.
The government has already begun, with only limited success so far, to
entice private funds into big road-building programmes through a system of
concessions and tolls. Mr Eduardo Aninat, the finance minister, has pledged
to extend private sector participation to ports and airports.
Separately, Corfo intends to sell Dollars 550m of its non-performing debt
portfolio - 'a reflection of bad loans made in the past' - for which Mr
Sandoval expects to raise Dollars 100m-Dollars 200m.
Some state companies such as Enap, the oil group, and Enami, the smelting
agency, are off limits - for the moment at least. More controversial still
is Codelco, the world's largest copper company, and still considered the
heart and soul of the Chilean economy.
But even here, the government is pushing through reforms which have been
labelled by opponents as privatisation by stealth. Codelco recently
announced plans to sell a majority stake of its power plant, Tocopilla,
valued at Dollars 500m-Dollars 600m. The group argues that the constitution,
which enshrines the nationalisation of Codelco, only covers core mining
activities.
Committed both to tight fiscal policy (even more than its prudent
predecessor) and to improving education and alleviating poverty, the new
administration is refocusing its spending priorities. Part of that strategy
involves a diminishing role in projects that smack of big spending - such as
roads, power and sanitation - given that the private sector appears willing
to bridge much of the investment gap. This, so the theory goes, will allow
the state to divert funds to schools, hospitals and deprived regions, where
private money is less forthcoming.

FT  09 SEP 94 / US plant spending to rise by 8.8%

US businesses plan to increase investments in plant and equipment by 8.8 per
cent this year, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. The upward
revision of the business capital spending survey from June is in line with
economists' expectations that capital investment will continue to play a
leading role in economic growth in 1994, despite higher interest rates.
The Commerce Department reported that the 5,000 businesses surveyed in July
and August said they were planning to spend Dollars 638bn (Pounds 411.6bn)
this year, up from Dollars 587bn last year, on constructing and modernising
buildings, installing new computer systems and upgrading equipment and
machinery. The figures are not adjusted for inflation.
The survey was in line with predictions that investments would rise for the
third straight year. Business investment grew by 7.3 per cent in 1993, after
a 3.4 per cent rise in 1992. If yesterday's forecast is realised it will be
the biggest jump in capital investment since the 1989 increase of 11.4 per
cent.
The July-August report is the final estimate of business spending plans for
the year and follows the June survey which forecast an 8.3 per cent rise in
investment spending this year.
According to the survey, manufacturers plan to increase investment by 7.3
per cent, compared to a 3.1 per cent rise last year. Non-manufacturing
businesses said they would increase investment spending by 9.5 per cent,
following the jump of 9.3 per cent in 1993.
Industries with the largest increases planned for 1994 are blast furnaces
and steel works (39.7 per cent), cars (28.9 per cent), stone, clay and glass
manufacturers (21.7 per cent) and electrical machinery (11.3 per cent).

FT  09 SEP 94 / Rift at the top of Fed is denied
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alan Blinder, the vice-chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, yesterday
denied any rift between himself and Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman,
over the need to control inflation, but insisted that central banks also
needed to pay attention to unemployment.
Mr Blinder repeated his belief that unemployment should play a role in
setting monetary policy, a view which sparked a flurry of concern that he
was 'soft on inflation' when he expressed it two weeks ago at a Federal
Reserve conference held in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
'To my mind, the controversial position that I staked out in Jackson Hole
amounted to endorsing the Federal Reserve Act,' he told a meeting of the
Mortgage Bankers Association in Washington yesterday, pointing out that the
statute establishing the Fed directed it to pursue both maximum employment
and stable prices.
But Mr Blinder insisted that Mr Greenspan and he were at one in believing
that monetary policy could only have an effect on unemployment in the short
run, but that in the long run there was no trade-off between unemployment
and inflation.
'If there's any difference it's usually that when the chairman says that he
is emphasising the fact that there isn't any long run trade-off, despite the
fact that the economy fluctuates in the short run, and I certainly agree
with that. . . I emphasised instead that there is in fact a short-run
trade-off, despite the fact that there is no long-run trade-off,' Mr Blinder
said.
'So this is exactly a case of whether you look at this glass and find it
half full or half empty,' he said, adding that he did not believe there were
any 'current operational differences of any significance' between him and
the rest of the Fed board.
Nevertheless, financial markets and some commentators had seen a possible
future policy disagreement in Mr Blinder's apparent refusal to give absolute
primacy to the fight against inflation, as most central bankers around the
world do.
Mr Blinder said yesterday that 'the inflation objective has to, by default
if nothing else, take primacy', because that was all that a central bank
could control in the long run.
However, he softened slightly his criticism of European central banks, which
he had accused in Jackson Hole of being 'quite far from on target' in their
policies. Yesterday, he said that 'almost everybody on the planet, I think,
believes that European unemployment rates now are too high', and that many
economists believed the rate could be reduced by perhaps 2 to 3 percentage
points through an expansion of aggregate demand.
But whereas in Jackson Hole he had focused his comments on central banks,
yesterday he said that he meant macroeconomic policy in general, including
fiscal policy.

FT  09 SEP 94 / World Trade News: BAe in Pounds 500m sale to Saudi Arabia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Saudi Arabia is to buy a further batch of about 20 British Aerospace Hawk
jet aircraft and a similar number of basic trainers, worth almost Pounds
500m.
The aircraft should be delivered from 1997, to train pilots who will fly the
48 Tornado GR1 ground attack aircraft which were ordered from BAe in January
1993.
The UK Ministry of Defence said that dates had been agreed for the supply of
training aircraft, but did not give any further details. British Aerospace
declined to comment.
The aircraft thought to be involved are the Hawk 60 advanced jet trainer and
the Swiss-made Pilatus PC-9 turboprop basic trainer, which will be supplied
through BAe as the prime contractor.
Both aircraft are already used by the Royal Saudi Air Force to train pilots
for their current fleet of Tornados. Training crew and other support
services are included.
The purchase will take place under the Al Yamamah II
government-to-government arms deal, payment for which is made in oil. Saudi
Arabia is thought to have increased the amount set aside for the programme
from 500,000 barrels a day to 600,000 barrels when the second Tornado order
was placed in 1993. The training aircraft package will be funded through
this increased oil barter.
British Aerospace has now sold more than 700 Hawks worldwide to 40
countries. It is used as an advanced trainer to prepare pilots for fast
fighter jets with the larger Hawk 100 and Hawk 200 versions used as light
fighter or ground attack aircraft.
Saudi Arabia presently has 30 of the Hawk 60 aircraft, as well as 72
Tornados, which are a mix of ground attack and air defence variants. BAe has
some 4,800 staff working in Saudi Arabia supporting the Al Yamamah deal.
The Saudi order will secure work at BAe factories at Warton in Lancashire
and Brough on Humberside. Work on the Hawk and Saudi Tornado orders is
expected to fill a gap in domestic work until production of the Eurofighter
2000 starts in earnest in 1997-98.
Al Yamamah contracts are worth some Pounds 2bn a year to British Aerospace.

accord

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico and Bolivia are to sign a free trade agreement at this weekend's
meeting of the Rio group of Latin American nations.
The agreement will be Mexico's fifth with a Latin American country,
following similar accords with Colombia and Venezuela, Chile and Costa Rica.
It will come into effect on January 1. Mexico's free trade agreement with
the US and Canada took effect on January 1 this year. Mexican President
Carlos Salinas said on Wednesday that it was 'very encouraging' that
negotiations over the treaty were concluded. He provided no details of the
agreement, nor would he say when the treaty would come into effect.
Bolivia's ambassador to Mexico has previously said the accord would be
signed by the country's two presidents at the Rio meeting.
The agreement is largely symbolic, with bilateral trade some Dollars 33m
last year, a fraction of Mexico's total trade of Dollars 117bn. According to
earlier press reports, the accord will remove tariff and most non-tariff
barriers over a 10-year period. The eight member countries of the Rio Group
are expected to discuss in the two day meeting the possibility of further
economic integration, and their response to the problems in Haiti and Cuba.

FT  09 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Telecoms 'to need more finance'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A surge in demand from Asia-Pacific countries for investment in their
fast-growing telecommunications sectors is expected next year.
Analysis by Salomon Brothers, the brokers, suggests that governments and
telecoms operators in the region will be seeking around Dollars 7bn (Pounds
4.5bn) before the end of 1995 to finance telecoms expansion.
The Dollars 7bn is mostly needed to fund the installation of new telephone
lines, particularly in those countries where economic growth is racing ahead
of telecoms capacity. It compares with barely Dollars 2bn raised
internationally by the region's telecoms sector last year.
Telecoms privatisations or convertible bond issues are planned or expected
in the next six months in Indonesia, India, Malaysia, Thailand and the
Philippines.
The largest investment demands are set to come from Indonesia, with about
Dollars 800m sought internationally for PT Indosat, the international
telecoms operator, and from India, where observers believe a similar sum is
likely to be sought for VSNL, another international operator. A Dollars 1bn
international equity offering for VSNL was cancelled in May, a serious
setback for India's attempts to raise funds from the international capital
markets. A new equity offering is likely.
Mr Andrew Harrington, Salomon Brothers telecoms analyst in Hong Kong, said
international funding was necessitated by the 'huge funding gap' for
telecoms investment in the region.
Developing countries in Asia-Pacific are seeking to increase their number of
telecoms lines from about 64m to 185m over the next decade, at an estimated
cost of Dollars 200bn.
The restructuring has the support of the World Bank, which believes
competition through licensing new operators is vital to stimulate telecoms
investment and improve services in the region.
Thailand has been the developing country most successful in attracting
overseas capital in the past year, with new public-private profit-sharing
arrangements established to attract foreign investment.

FT  09 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Raids in Japan expose misuse of aid
programme - Some projects to help the poor really have commercial motives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Maritime Polytechnic in the Philippines, built with Japanese
overseas development aid, is equipped to train 700 seamen but to date few
have occupied its halls.
A children's hospital in Pakistan had to leave sophisticated medical
equipment, purchased with aid from Japan, lying idle because no one could
handle the machinery.
Japan's overseas development aid, which at Dollars 11.3bn is the largest in
the world, has recently been widely criticised as commercially motivated and
ineffective.
The raid this week by Japan's Fair Trade Commission on more than 40
companies seemed to confirm what many in Japan had long suspected: that ODA
money was being shared by Japanese companies for projects that served their
interests more than those of the recipients.
The companies, which include some of Japan's largest trading houses such as
Mitsubishi and Marubeni, are suspected of forming cartels to pre-determine
which companies would win orders for certain ODA projects.
While the raid in itself came as a surprise to the Japanese public, the
possibility that such bid-rigging involving ODA projects had been going on,
did not.
In 1986, two employees of the Japan International Co-operation Agency
(JICA), which is responsible for implementing Japan's aid programmes, were
found guilty of accepting bribes from companies keen to win aid projects.
Japanese companies have also been suspected of engaging in illicit deals
with the government of Ferdinand Marcos, former president of the
Philippines.
Japan's aid programme has frequently been criticised for its lack of
transparency from the decision-making process to implementation.
'The aid policy is determined by bureaucrats but the implementation is in
fact left up to companies,' contends Mr Yoshinori Murai, professor at the
Institute of Asian Cultures at Sophia University in Tokyo and co-ordinator
of the ODA Research and Study Group, a non-governmental organisation.
The accusation applies to less than 20 per cent of Japan's ODA involving
grants and technical co-operation aid which is tied, meaning that only
Japanese companies can win contracts for building the hospitals, training
centres and schools and supplying them with equipment. The remaining 80 per
cent of Japan's ODA is untied and last year only 35 per cent of contracts
were awarded to Japanese companies.
The latest suspicion of cartel activity is thought to involve, in
particular, technical co-operation assistance which, in addition to being
tied, is awarded through a designated bidding system. Contracts are not
awarded through competitive bidding but are restricted to companies which
have registered with JICA.
Furthermore, many of the projects carried out with technical co-operation
aid are thought to be recommended to recipient governments by Japanese
companies themselves.
Critics say the need for companies which have invested resources in coming
up with aid projects to ensure that they win the relevant contracts
encourages cartel activity and the designated bidding system facilitates
such practices.
Foreign ministry officials admit the system has its flaws.
'Many weak governments of developing countries do not have the ability to
draw up their own projects and JICA employees do not have the expertise to
judge the costs of projects and facilities,' says one foreign affairs
official.
Foreign ministry officials also concede that many ODA projects fail for lack
of follow-up activity, but insist recipient countries must eventually look
after facilities for themselves.
'We provide technical experts to help train local staff but we cannot go on
doing so forever. Japan's ODA policy is to encourage self-help,' says one.
The foreign ministry, stung by the latest allegations, has asked JICA to
consider whether the system needs to be reviewed.
In line with a growing trend for greater transparency in Japan's bidding
system, JICA should consider providing more information on bids, Mr Murai
says.
But anything beyond that, such as an ODA basic law, is likely to be resisted
by the bureaucrats who have their own vested interests to consider, he says.

FT  09 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Nissan wins US court ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nissan has won its court battle in the US to prove its multipurpose vehicles
are cars rather than trucks and so should carry an import tariff of 2.5 per
cent instead of 25 per cent.
The ruling by the US Court of Appeal paves the way for a possible refund of
tariffs already paid by Nissan and supports the case of foreign car makers,
many of them Japanese, which have been hit by the higher tariff rate on
multipurpose vehicles imported into the US.
Nissan, which imported a two-door multipurpose vehicle, the Pathfinder, into
the US between 1989 and 1990, was ordered by US Customs in 1989 to pay a 25
per cent tariff on the vehicle, which was classified as a truck. The
Japanese company had been appealing against the classification, saying the
Pathfinder should be rated as a passenger car and given the lower tariff
rate.
The Pathfinder is manufactured at Nissan's plant in Kyushu, southern Japan.
However, Nissan had stopped exporting the two-door Pathfinder in 1990 and
started exporting a four-door version, after a US ruling classified
four-door multipurpose vehicles as passenger cars.
US vehicle makers have been able to use the 25 per cent tariff on imported
trucks to secure a growing market for themselves.
One reason for the fall in the Japanese share of the US market in the early
1990s was a lack of multipurpose vehicle models, but the truck tariff rate
on imported multipurpose vehicles has not helped their market penetration.
The argument put forward by the Big Three - Ford, Chrysler and General
Motors - that imported multipurpose vehicles should be classified as trucks
has not always been upheld by the authorities.
In 1989, the US Treasury ruled that only two-door multipurpose vehicles
should be classified as trucks, since their principal purpose could be
considered transport of goods. Four-door multipurpose vehicles, on the other
hand, should be classified as passenger cars since their principal purpose
was to transport people, the Treasury decided.
Furthermore, with the market dominated by US makers, the International Trade
Commission could not sustain a finding of injury done against domestic
vehicle makers when US manufacturers tried in 1992 to raise the tariff rate
through dumping action.

FT  09 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Malaysia's planners ride the fast lane -
The government is willing to take risks with ambitious projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, yesterday declared open one
of south-east Asia's most ambitious infrastructure projects - an 848km
expressway stretching the length of the Malaysian peninsula, from the border
with Thailand in the north to the causeway to Singapore in the south. Called
the north-south highway, it is looked on with pride by Malaysia's planners.
The highway is a vital artery that should relieve transport bottlenecks and
promote economic growth not only within Malaysia but between neighbouring
countries of Asean (the Association of South-East Asian Nations). It is
Malaysia's first big privatised infrastructure project, built without
massive government funds and likely to be finished well ahead of schedule.
But there is another side to the highway story. The original cost of the
project was put at MDollars 3.45bn (Dollars 1.34bn). Cost overruns have
resulted in a final bill of nearly twice that amount. Steep increases in
toll charges have angered motorists and led to charges of 'highway robbery'
against the company managing the expressway. There have been criticisms that
some work on the highway is below standard: only months after opening, some
sections are under repair.
Over the next four years the Malaysian government plans to spend more than
MDollars 40bn on various infrastructure projects. By the end of the century
that figure is likely to rise to more than MDollars 70bn.
New infrastructure is urgently needed to cope with pressures arising from
six years of 8 per cent-plus economic growth. What staggers planners from
elsewhere - and sharpens appetites of the world's construction companies and
financiers - is that these projects are not being phased over a lengthy
period. They are all in progress now, or are about to happen.
On Wednesday, Malaysia lifted a ban on government contracts for British
companies. The ban was imposed in February in retaliation for British media
reports hinting at corruption in senior levels of the Malaysian government.
British companies have been among the most active in trying to win a share
of Malaysia's large infrastructure cake.
Malaysia has been a pioneer in south-east Asia in pushing ahead the
privatisation process. Dr Mahathir's government has made clear it expects
the private sector, rather than the state, to be the main mover behind
infrastructure development.
Malaysia has enthusiastically adopted the build-operate-transfer (BOT)
concept. Local companies, most in joint ventures with foreign partners, are
being told to build their projects, raise the bulk of their own finance and
operate facilities for 20 or 25 years, recouping money by imposing tolls or
other charges.
With electricity demand increasing at 14 per cent a year, Malaysia has been
faced with power shortages. To relieve the burden on Tenaga Nasional, the
partially privatised power utility, the government has invited local
companies, in joint ventures with foreign concerns, to construct power
stations on a BOT basis.
These companies, termed independent power producers (IPPs), are already
building five large power plants with a total price tag approaching MDollars
10bn. Siemens, British Gas, Asea Brown Boveri and John Brown are among
foreign companies involved.
Much the same principle is behind other infrastructure projects, ranging
from a MDollars 10bn international airport south of Kuala Lumpur to a
MDollars 2bn light railway system in the capital and a MDollars 6bn national
sewerage scheme.
Malaysia is considering applying the BOT concept to a university it plans to
open in a joint venture with the University of London. Private developers
will build a campus in Kuala Lumpur and recoup costs through student
charges.
Infrastructure has caught the imagination of the local stock market.
Malaysian companies rumoured to be in line for infrastructure projects have
seen a sharp rise in their shares prices. But amid all the euphoria there
are question marks over the direction of Malaysian policy.
Much of the planning associated with projects is built on the premise that
the country will continue to have soaring economic growth. A downturn could
bring serious problems to the companies involved, with revenues from
completed projects not matching costs.
Political connections often seem to have been the most important factor in
granting infrastructure projects to local companies. In 1988 the Renong
Group, then directly owned by Dr Mahathir's United Malays National
Organisation, won the privatisation contract for the north-south highway.
Renong has subsequently won a wide range of other multi- million dollar
infrastructure contracts, ranging from a new bridge linking Malaysia and
Singapore to a MDollars 555m contract to build a new stadium complex for the
1998 Commonwealth Games, which will be held in Kuala Lumpur. Competitors say
tender procedures are often ignored.
Privatisation and BOT arrangements on infrastructure projects are new ideas,
even in the west. There are doubts whether Malaysia has the necessary
supervisory apparatus to monitor both the construction and operation of such
a vast array of projects. Consumers might raise objections to relatively
high charges likely to be charged on facilities like the Kuala Lumpur light
railway. Serious problems on such an issue have recently arisen over a BOT
road scheme in Bangkok.
There are doubts whether the capital markets, domestic or international,
will be willing to risk ploughing such large sums into one area of the
economy, without government guarantees. Local banks recently signed loan
agreements worth MDollars 5.6bn to finance three independent power projects.
Some financiers feel such focused lending is imprudent: it could also put a
squeeze on funding for other areas of economic activity.
Critics say some projects are more for prestige than economic necessity. A
company in Sarawak, east Malaysia, with no previous experience in the power
sector, has been given preliminary approval to build a MDollars 15bn dam,
nearly twice the height of the Aswan dam in Egypt. The project not only
involves building a dam in a jungle area: an underwater power cable will
transfer the power to peninsular Malaysia via a 650km underwater cable - a
technical job never attempted before.
Dr Mahathir and his government have shown they are not afraid of risks. 'The
ability to learn from failures is as critical as the lessons from the
success of any experiment,' Dr Mahathir told an infrastructure conference
earlier this week. 'The right approach seems to be to marry boldness with
realism.'

FT  09 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Glasnost for ports in Estonia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TALLINN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The end of Soviet rule has given a new lease of life to Estonia's smaller
ports, most of which were closed by Moscow to ensure tight control of the
Baltic state's borders. Kunda, a small port 120km east of Tallinn shut down
in 1940, reopened last week, enabling cement to be shipped directly to
export markets in Germany, Belgium, the UK and West Africa.
The cement is produced by Soviet-era cement works within the harbour and was
mainly used domestically and transported by rail.
Kunda, originally founded as a port by Tsar Alexander I in 1805, is well
placed for trade with Scandinavia, Germany and the St Petersburg market, and
could be used for other goods, said Mr Jan Owren, managing director of Kunda
Nordic Cement - the Estonian joint-venture with American and Nordic
partners, which owns both the port and the cement works.
Exports are vital for the survival of the Kunda factory, as domestic
consumption has plummeted since independence in 1991. Exports accounted for
70 per cent of the 440,000 tonnes of cement and clinker produced last year.
In a test period since May this year, 70,000 tonnes of cement have been
shipped out of Kunda, which has a capacity to ship 500,000 tonnes annually.
In 1988 more than 70 per cent of the factory's 1.2m tonne output was used
within Estonia, much of it by the Soviet army.
The port was financed by Atlas-Nordic Cement, which has a 30.3 per cent
share in Kunda Nordic Cement, while the Estonian government has retained
49.9 per cent. The building materials industry is considered an important
sector for the country's economy.
Other shareholders include the International Finance Corporation, the
private lending arm of the World Bank; the Nordic Environmental Finance
Corporation; and the Finnfund.
The development of the port marks the first stage in a three year, Dollars
30m project to renovate the factory's Soviet-era machinery, increase
capacity (currently 200,000 tonnes annually per kiln), and drastically
reduce the dust pollution emitted by the three cement kilns.
'Our aim is to increase capacity by 30 per cent, raise production and make
it profitable,' Mr Owren said.
Reconstruction of the Kunda port foreshadows the Dollars 600m reconstruction
of the three big deep-water ports in Tallinn.

FT  09 SEP 94 / World Trade News: EU car dealer rules to be renewed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reform of regulations governing the distribution and sale of new cars within
the European Union is expected to be finalised at a meeting of the European
Commission on September 21. The motor industry now operates under a
so-called 'block exemption', which allows car makers to operate selective
and exclusive dealer networks in breach of European competition rules.
The exemption was granted for 10 years and is due to expire at the end of
June next year. The Commission is expected to approve renewal of the block
exemption, which carmakers consider crucial to their ability to maintain
their networks of authorised dealers.
The final details of the new regulation are unlikely to be settled until
late this year following consultations with EU member states and other
interested parties.
An intense debate has been waged between the competition and industry
directorates over how radically the system should be reformed in order to
improve competition in the European car market. The competition directorate
has argued that experience over the last 10 years has shown that the block
exemption 'has not contributed in any significant way to either the opening
up of national markets or to the development of flexible and efficient
structures in the distribution of cars and spares'.
It has been supported by European consumer groups, which have called for the
deregulation of the car market.
Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, has supported the case for block
exemption renewal, however, partly as an instrument for controlling the flow
of Japanese vehicle imports into the European Union.
The competition authorities have been concerned that the present
distribution system has also contributed to the wide divergence of car
prices across west Europe and has served to hinder cross-border purchases of
new cars.
The car makers maintain that car price differentials are chiefly caused,
however, by currency fluctuations and the wide disparities between the
levels of car taxation in different EU member states.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Politics comes second to Japanese pinball: Mistrust and
apathy over an electoral test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the main street of Toyohashi the former prime minister was having
difficulty competing with the rival attractions of the pinball arcade.
Mr Tsutomu Hata had arrived in his campaign bus to canvass support for the
opposition candidate in Sunday's by-election. But the desolate little
gathering of supporters and curious onlookers never looked like outnumbering
the men eagerly crowding into the pachinko parlour.
It was a typical scene. The election in Aichi prefecture, 150 miles to the
west of Tokyo, has attracted more interest from the national politicians and
psephologists than it has from the voters.
The principal cause of the excitement is the decision of the three parties
of the governing coalition and the 10 parties of the opposition bloc to
field a single candidate each.
It thus represents the first test of popular opinion since the formation of
the strange new alliances around which Japanese politics have coalesced in
the last few months - a minor referendum on the unlikely coalition between
the Liberal Democratic party (LDP) and Social Democratic party (SDP).
It is also an important test of the government's resolve on the popular
issue of political reform
The vacancy for the seat in the upper house of the Japanese parliament was
caused by the removal of the sitting member following his admission that he
falsified his educational record during the last election campaign in 1992.
The vast constituency, centred on Japan's fourth largest city, Nagoya, is
home to the world headquarters of Toyota Motor Corporation. More than
200,000 among the electorate of 5m work for Toyota and its related
companies.
In normal circumstances the election would be a close-run thing. Two years
ago the multi-member constituency returned candidates from both the LDP and
the Democratic Socialist Party, one of the opposition parties.
But traditional voter apathy has been compounded by a growing mistrust of
politicians. The turnout was just 47 per cent in 1992, and the campaigns for
the two main candidates expect it to be less than 40 per cent this time.
And to this mix of apathy and disenchantment has been added the volatile
ingredient of confusion. The unprecedented fluidity of Japanese politics in
the last year seems to have left many voters bewildered.
The campaign teams for the two main candidates both expressed concern that
the shifting coalitions in Japanese politics have become so bizarre that
electors will not know which candidate represents which group.
Nonetheless, opinion polls suggest that those who to vote are set to deliver
a significant rebuff to the government. The opposition candidate, Mr Yuzuru
Tsuzuki, is well-liked locally. More potently, he is mining a rich seam of
voter disgust at the cynical opportunism of the SDP and LDP in burying their
divisions in the interest of self-preservation.
'I used to vote socialist,' said one man on the streets of Toyohashi, 'but I
was never so shocked in my whole life as when I heard of the formation of
this coalition.' 'This is a government of men united by just one thing,'
said another, 'their desire for power.'
The coalition's candidate, the former United Nations diplomat, Mr Jiro
Mizuno, had the unmistakeable air of a man expecting a drubbing. 'It is a
very hard struggle,' he said, 'but I believe I can win.' His campaign
supporters had had even less success in enticing people from the pachinko
parlour when they stopped by earlier. 'Please vote for Mr Mizuno, if only to
save his face,' appealed one of them.
Indeed there is a growing fear in coalition circles that Mr Mizuno might
even be beaten into third place by a local television personality running as
an independent.
Differences within the coalition have meant that policies have been avoided
altogether. Instead they have chosen to focus largely on the personality of
their undeniably charming candidate. Mr Mizuno's election literature dwells
heavily on his tastes in music (he likes Linda Ronstadt) and films (his
favourites are, of course, those staples of Japanese cinema-goers, 'Roman
Holiday' and 'Casablanca'.)
Then, under a beaming picture of the 48-year-old is a litany of his
well-known supporters - a list of mostly national and local government
figures that includes, unaccountably, Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, the former
secretary-general of the United Nations.
The opposition seems undaunted by such heavyweight competition. Mr Atsuaki
Miwa, the campaign manager, thinks the electorate is ready to deliver a
crushing blow to the governing parties and in the process register its
support for the reform process hesitantly under way in Japan.
'Though the coalition parties say they support reform, the voters know that
they did all they could to oppose it when it was being legislated. A vote
for Mr Tsuzuki will be a vote for an end to the old politics represented by
the SDP and LDP.'
Mr Miwa's optimism is probably justified. But there is little doubt that
popular disillusionment is stronger than ever - disillusionment that
embraces much of the opposition too. Support for the principles of political
reform remains widespread. Confidence that it will actually make any
difference is ebbing fast.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Seoul urged to ease curbs on currencies: State panel
suggests dropping 'most' exchange controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A government-appointed panel yesterday recommended that South Korea abolish
most foreign exchange controls by 1999.
The ministry of finance will consider the committee's findings when it
proposes reforms to ease restrictions on capital flows, which are expected
to be announced in November.
South Korea currently imposes strict regulations on capital transfers as
part of the government's strong control over the financial system.
Among the committee's main conclusions is that the government should permit
an increase in the foreign ownership of Korean securities, which is limited
to 10 per cent of a company's stock.
It proposed that the foreign ownership limit should be raised in three
stages in 1995, 1997 and 1999, with the possibility that the ceiling would
be abolished by the end of the decade.
Foreign investors have expressed frustration about the limits, which have
prevented them from investing in one of the potentially buoyant stock
markets in Asia.
But the reforms also liberalise the outflow of capital, reflecting
government concern that an extensive inflow of foreign capital would cause
inflationary pressure.
Companies would be freed to raise capital abroad, where interest rates are
lower than in Korea, by 1997. The reforms are meant to ease financial
conditions for Korean companies, as they increase spending on production
capacity and research and development.
But restrictions would remain on the opening of the bond and short-term
money markets to foreign investors. The Korean currency is also unlikely to
be fully liberalised, reflecting concerns about a rapid appreciation of the
Korean won, which would harm the export-dependent economy.
It is still uncertain whether the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development will accept the proposed schedule, since most of the reforms
will be implemented only after Korea joins the organisation in 1996.
A recent OECD report on the Korean economy criticised the government for
maintaining one of the most regulated financial systems among the advanced
industrial countries, even if its proposed financial liberalisation
programme is fully implemented.
Another report, by the Lausanne-based International Institute for Management
Development and the Geneva-based World Economic Forum, ranked South Korea a
poor 24th in world competitiveness among a list of 23 OECD members and 18
developing nations.
The IMD/WEF report said South Korea was the most culturally closed and
protectionist nation of the 41, and placed it third from bottom in its
internationalisation league.

Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary-general, yesterday

46-year Kashmir dispute, which continues to undermine relations between
India and Pakistan, writes Farhan Bokhari in Islamabad. The countries have
fought three wars, and thousands of soldiers still face each other in the
region.
'I have promised to be an honest broker to encourage a dialogue between the
two protagonists of this problem,' said Mr Boutros Ghali at the end of a
three-day visit to Pakistan, before leaving for New Delhi.
However, he conceded that his role would be limited without the agreement of
the two sides. In recent months western diplomats have been worried by
increased tensions along the disputed border.

The head of the communist allies of President Nelson Mandela's governing
party hit out yesterday at the big salaries earned by South Africa's new
rulers, Reuter reports from Soweto.
Mr Charles Nqakula, general secretary of the South African Communist party,
told trade union activists that the new rulers were in danger of
representing only the bosses. 'It is scandalous that such huge amounts of
money are squandered,' he told a meeting of the Congress of South African
Trade Unions, an umbrella group with close ties to the communists. 'We

echelons of the public sector,' he added.
The 'gravy train' comment hits a raw nerve in Mr Mandela's four-month-old
government, which has been accused by such respected figures as Archbishop
Desmond Tutu of enriching itself in the same way as the old white
administrations.

<TEXT>
The New Zealand economy is set to show sustainable growth over the next two
years without suffering from inflationary pressure or a widening current
account deficit, said Mr Don Brash, Reserve Bank governor, writes Terry Hall
in Wellington.
Mr Brash is charged with setting interest rate and exchange rate policies
with the aim of ensuring inflation does not rise above 2 per cent. He said
that, following gross domestic product growth in excess of 5 per cent last
year, the bank was projecting GDP to rise by 4.4 per cent during the current
year and by 3.1 per cent in 1996.
The projected slowing of the growth rate was primarily due to cyclical
influences on consumption and investment, Mr Brash told a news conference.
Forecasts showed that underlying inflation would rise moderately, helped by
an expected increase in exchange and interest rates over the next three
years.
New Zealand would benefit from continued strong exports, consumption growth
would moderate, fiscal surpluses would increase strongly, and there would be
strong growth in employment.

<TEXT>
Sri Lanka's new government yesterday made fresh moves towards a peace deal
with Tamil separatist guerrillas in the island's north and east, by offering
to restore supplies of food and power, Reuter reports from Colombo.
'We are prepared to give power to the north,' deputy defence minister
Anuruddha Ratwatte told a news conference. He said the government needed
only six weeks to set up power generators in the northern Jaffna peninsula,
stronghold of the rebel Tamil Tigers, if the Tigers were prepared to
co-operate in their installation. The government was also prepared to extend
the national electricity grid to the north, which has been without power
since rebels blew up power lines in the mid-1980s.
Mr Ratwatte said the government wanted to send food convoys, under the
supervision of the International Committee of the Red Cross, by road to
Jaffna, as monsoon rains due in three weeks would make transportation by sea
difficult. Normal land routes to Jaffna cannot be used because of the
fighting.
The deputy minister said the government had appointed a task force, headed
by prime minister Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, to rehabilitate the
island's east, where security forces have gained the upper hand against
guerrillas. The premier had earlier partially lifted a four-year economic
blockade on the north, saying her People's Alliance government, elected last
month, wanted to ease the suffering of Tamils there and hold peace talks
with the rebels. More than 30,000 people have died since the Tigers launched
their crusade for independence in 1983.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Fresh battles at Cairo talks: Immigration dispute emerges at
population conference
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Controversial clauses on immigration have emerged as a new battleground in
tortuous attempts to reach consensus on a final document at the
International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo.
Britain and Germany are objecting strongly to a section of the draft
document which says that families of immigrants have the right to be
re-united in one country. They are concerned that this suggests that
relatives of immigrant workers or of naturalised citizens have rights to
immigration.
London and Bonn may be prepared to back the principle that families should
be united, but are pressing for a new phrasing which could not be used in
court, delegates from European Union countries said. The present text, which
has not been agreed, urges governments to 'recognise the right of family
reunification'.
However, the deadlock over text on abortion policy remained the chief
obstacle to consensus, with delegates braced to scrap a scheduled weekend
break and negotiate up to the last hour of the conference on Tuesday night.
'I don't think there is any one group trying to wreck the conference,
although there may be groups trying to hold it to ransom,' said a British
delegate. The Vatican and a 'hard core' of about 10 Roman Catholic countries
remain bitterly opposed to the proposed wording on abortion, although Moslem
states have now given their backing.
Dr Nafis Sadik, executive director of the UN population fund, who is
chairing the conference, said: 'I do not think the Vatican will agree (to
the policy document) even if all the phrases (on abortion) are left out,
because basically they are against contraceptive technology.'
Holy See officials insisted they were seeking a final text to which they
could agree.
However, delegates yesterday reached agreement on the controversial
financing target of Dollars 17bn by the year 2000, more than treble present
levels.
Two thirds of the money is expected to come from developing countries. Mr
Abdul Suleiman, from the Nigerian delegation, warned the figure 'is very
much a global average - in some countries, the ratio will have to be more
like 50:50.'
Yesterday Baroness Chalker, the UK minister for overseas development and
head of the British delegation, repeated her pledge that Britain would spend
Pounds 100m over the next two years on overseas family planning programmes -
an increase of 60 per cent.

FT  09 SEP 94 / China angered as US boosts Taiwan links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON and WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>

   TAIPEI, TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Amid protests from Beijing, Taipei yesterday welcomed moves by the US to
boost unofficial ties with the island, but complained the changes, announced
late on Wednesday did not go far enough.
Following a lengthy policy review, Washington will permit high-level
bilateral meetings in government offices. Taipei's de facto embassy in the
US, the Co-ordination Council for North American Affairs, will become known
as the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office.
'We are happy to see and welcome the Clinton administration's policy
adjustment toward us, but we are also dissatisfied with certain areas where
we hope the US government can adopt a practical attitude to make further
improvements,' Mr Frederick Chien, Taiwan's foreign minister, told
reporters. He voiced disappointment that the US would not back Taiwan's bid
to rejoin the United Nations.
An angry Beijing sharply denounced the adjustments, warning, without
specifying precisely how, that thawing Sino-US ties would suffer as a
consequence. China views Taiwan as a renegade province. The US switched
diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979, implicitly
acknowledging China's claim to sovereignty over the island.
The US State Department said the enhanced contacts did not represent a
deviation from the US's 'one-China' policy. The changes were made 'for the
purpose of solving practical problems and doing business', according to a
department official. 'They carry with them no implication that we consider
the relationship (with Taipei) to be official.'
The change coincides with a standoff among Taiwan, China and Japan over
whether Taiwan's president, Mr Lee Teng-hui, should be permitted to attend
the Asian Games in Hiroshima early next month.
The US adjustment will be closely watched and could precipitate similar
changes by other governments.
The American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei, which has long lobbied for
upgraded ties, said the US moves would improve business links but did not go
'as far as we would have liked'. Taiwan was the US's fifth-largest trading
partner in 1993, buying US goods and services to double the value of China's
trade.
While the island's economic strength played an important role in policy
change, its democratic transformation since martial law was lifted in 1987
has not escaped attention.
Mr Shen Guofang, spokesman for China's foreign ministry, charged that the US
upgrade 'seriously violates the principles' on which bilateral relations are
based and 'interferes with the internal affairs of China'.
Mr Shen went on to menace Japan, saying if President Lee is issued travel
documents allowing him to attend the Asian Games, Sino-Japanese ties will be
affected. 'If Lee Teng-hui goes to Japan to attend the Asian Games, it will
bring serious political troubles to the Asian Games,' he said, declining to
elaborate.
President Lee is refusing to knuckle under to pressure to politely decline
an invitation from the Olympic Council of Asia, putting the Japanese
government in an embarrassing position. China earlier threatened a boycott,
which could prove disastrous for the games as China's athletes are the
region's strongest and comprise the biggest delegation.
Analysts said Beijing fears an increasingly assertive and confident Taiwan
is successfully punching through the diplomatic isolation which has shrouded
the island since the UN granted Taipei's seat in the body to Beijing in
1971. Eyeing Taiwan's economic clout, countries which recognise Beijing are
increasingly willing to risk provoking tantrums from Beijing to informally
host Taiwanese officials.
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported yesterday that Beijing has
drafted a 'war plan' to suppress Taiwan's gains in the diplomatic arena. The
plan, approved by President Jiang Zemin, calls for a carrot-and-stick
approach.
Taiwan will relaunch its bid to rejoin the UN when the body reconvenes this
fall. But China holds veto power as a permanent member of the security
council, and is likely to block Taipei's efforts as it did last year.
In Tokyo an embarrassed government was attempting to stay on the sidelines.
Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's Socialist prime minister, said it would be
difficult to arrange for Mr Lee's attendance at the games, but stopped short
of barring him.
China's political and economic weight as Japan's second largest trade
partner, and the largest military power in the region means Japan is under
compelling pressure to put China first. But a snub to Taiwan would harm
Tokyo's policy of trying to keep the widest possible circle of friends among
its Asian neighbours.
Japanese government officials had no doubt their political masters would
ultimately have to bend to China's wishes. Tokyo entertains diplomatic
relations with Beijing but not with Taipei, they pointed out.

<TEXT>
Japanese politics yesterday lost an influential behind-the-scenes builder of
coalitions when the head and founding father of the main trade union
movement resigned.
Mr Akira Yamagishi, 65, cited health reasons for his unexpected decision to
step down as head of Rengo, the 8m-member trade union federation.
Rengo is the most powerful supporter of the left-wing Social Democratic
party, a member of the government coalition. Yet the union group has been in
upheaval since the Socialists, led by Mr Tomiichi Murayama, a former union
official, formed a government 2 1/2 months ago with the left's traditional
opponent, the conservative Liberal Democratic party.
Mr Kozo Igarashi, the Socialist chief cabinet secretary, yesterday voiced
regret at Mr Yamagishi's retirement.
Mr Yamagishi, a moderate trade union official throughout his career, became
the most important figure in Japan's labour movement by increasing its
influence in the traditionally closed circuit of business, government and
political elite. He was instru-mental in bringing together private and
public sector unions to form Rengo five years ago and is close to Mr
Murayama and the moderate leadership of the Socialist party.
As such, Mr Yamagishi was an influence in the Socialists' decision last
weekend to scrap their traditional extreme pacifist policies to fall less
out of line with the LDP on defence and foreign affairs. The policy switch
has angered the left wing of both the Socialist party and Rengo, possibly a
factor in Mr Yamagishi's resig-nation.
He began a campaign to unify opposition parties in 1992 and played an
important part in the creation of the eight-party coalition which succeeded
last summer in pushing the LDP out of government for the first time in
nearly four decades.
However, Mr Yamagishi has never fulfilled his ambition of uniting the SDP
with the Democratic Socialist party, a moderate offshoot of the original
Socialists also supported by Rengo.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Australia's shipping industry ground to a halt yesterday when port workers
began an indefinite nationwide strike over the government's alleged failure
to develop a restructuring package for the state-owned Australian National
Line, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney.
Last month the government shelved plans to privatise ANL, claiming it was in
such poor financial condition that it 'couldn't be given away'. The company
has made losses in six of the last seven years. The union claims the
government plans to liquidate the business.
Mr Laurie Brereton, federal transport minister, urged a swift end to the
industrial action, saying it augured badly for government efforts to save
ANL.
Mr Paddy Crumlin, deputy national secretary of the Maritime Union of
Australia, said the strike would affect all ships other than vessels
transporting liquid natural gas to Japan.
The Australian Chamber of Shipping said the strike would cost the economy
millions of dollars and reinforce the low regard in which Australia's
waterfront industry was held overseas. The ACS calculates it costs on
average ADollars 40,000 (Pounds 19,000) a day per vessel to have a ship
idle. Broken Hill Proprietary, the large mining and resources group which
has a significant shipping business, expressed similar dismay.
Foster's Brewing Group, which owns Courage in the UK, is suing Price
Waterhouse for unspecified damages, claiming the international accountancy
firm was negligent and failed to inquire properly into ADollars 66.5m
(Pounds 32m) worth of foreign exchange transactions authorised by executives
in 1988 but now alleged to be 'sham deals'.
The dealings are at the heart of a lengthy committal hearing under way in
Melbourne and involving former executives of Elders IXL, the brewing and
agribusiness group which owned Foster's.

Swiss authorities have been given a fairly strong - if grudging -
endorsement from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
for their recent management of the Swiss economy. Switzerland is recovering
from three years of mild recession and the OECD, in its latest annual
assessment, forecasts 1.5 per cent real growth this year and 2.5 per cent
next year with low inflation. But it predicts that a further round of public
spending cuts and tax increases will be needed to eliminate a relatively
high budget deficit, and 'stepped up' efforts should be made to liberalise
many economic sectors and align standards with those of the EU.

Two Italian banks and the country's state pensions institute yesterday
announced a joint venture to encourage the underdeveloped Italian pension
fund sector. Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, the Treasury-controlled bank, IMI,
the recently privatised financial services group, and INPS, the state
pensions institute, have agreed to offer fund management and administrative
services to company schemes or open funds. Pensions reform is at the centre
of the Italian government's efforts to cut spending for the 1995 budget, but
the country's 200 or so pension funds account for only a small part of
retirement provision in Italy. The Treasury has already said it wants to
reform existing legislation to encourage pension funds, by reducing taxes
and other charges. Mr Clemente Mastella, the labour minister, yesterday
reassured Italians that funds based on investment would complement rather
than replace the existing system.

Drugs traffickers are still getting chemicals needed by the cocaine trade
from Germany and Holland in spite of a European Union regulation controlling
their export, according to senior EU officials. This emerged at a meeting in
Berlin yesterday of interior ministers from 22 European states, intended to
bind east and central Europe into the EU's efforts to combat drugs and
organised crime. The Bonn government is understood to have pledged action to
staunch any leakage of these 'precursor' chemicals, like acetone, but Mr
Michael Howard, UK home secretary, just back from South America, told his
colleagues that 'it is clear that precursor and essential chemicals are
finding their way to South American countries'. The 22 states have agreed to
operate together across frontiers not only against narcotics but against
smugglers of nuclear materials, illegal immigrants and the 1.8m stolen
vehicles on the EU wanted list, a large number of which have found their way
into eastern Europe.

Elf Aquitaine, the French state-controlled oil group, plans to become a
significant minority shareholder in Renault by investing up to FFr1bn
(Pounds 120m) in its eventual privatisation. Renault has already invested
FFr1bn in Elf, which was privatised earlier this year. Elf's reciprocal
investment will create one of the noyaux durs, or 'hard core' shareholding
agreements that have been a traditional tenet of French industry and are now
playing a prominent role in the centre-right government's privatisation
policy. The timing of the Renault share sale has not yet been fixed. The
government is conducting a valuation of Renault (estimated by analysts to be
worth around FFr40bn) as a precursor to selling part of its 80 per cent
stake. But Renault is vying for the next slot on the privatisation schedule
with the Assurances Generales de France (AGF) insurance group.

President Geidar Aliev of Azerbaijan and President Levon Ter-Petrosian of

over Nagorno-Karabakh. Russia's foreign ministry spokesman said both sides
had demonstrated a willingness to seek compromises. 'However, at least one
more round of intensive work will be required to finalise the document,' he
said. The agreement being discussed calls for an end to hostilities,
disengagement of warring parties, the deployment of mostly Russian
peacekeepers and the return of refugees. But there still are outstanding
issues, such as when Armenian forces will withdraw from areas seized outside
Nagorno-Karabakh and the exact composition of the peacekeeping force. The
agreement also does not stipulate the final status of the enclave, which has
declared independence from Azerbaijan.

<TEXT>
Serb forces from Bosnia and Croatia yesterday launched an assault against
mainly Moslem army positions in the north-western Bosnian enclave of Bihac.
The attacks - which came as the international community appears ready to
reward Serbia for its month-long blockade of Bosnia Serbs - suggest that,
despite the shift in Belgrade's position, Serb forces in Bosnia and Croatia
are determined to continue fighting.
Serb forces fired surface-to-air missiles at two Nato combat aircraft sent
to investigate the fighting at Bihac, but UN officials said the jets were
not hit.
UN officials in Zagreb said they were concerned that the fighting in Bihac,
which they described as a limited incursion, could develop into an all-out
attack on the enclave. Western observers said the attacks were significant
as they involved Serb rebels from both Bosnia and Croatia, two distinct
groups which do not always co-operate.
There were further signs of a thaw in the west's policy toward Serbia
proper. Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, said he welcomed a
decision by the five members of the international contact group on Bosnia to
ask the UN Security Council to discuss easing sanctions against Serbia and
Montenegro. Western officials said earlier in the week that Serbia, in a
further effort to placate the contact group, had agreed in principle to
allow non-military western observers to monitor Serbia's embargo of the
Bosnian Serbs.

Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, and the Bank of Italy
yesterday sought to bury the hatchet in a damaging two-month row over the
role of the central bank.
The peace initiative took the form of a well-publicised meeting organised
yesterday evening between Mr Berlusconi and Mr Antonio Fazio, the bank's
governor. The row has been a factor conditioning the negative sentiment
towards Italy in the financial markets that has seen the lira fall to
historic lows against the D-Mark.
The meeting was the first between the two since a formal round of
discussions which the prime minister held with leading institutional figures
in the immediate aftermath of taking office in May. Relations between the
Berlusconi government and the Bank of Italy began on an uncomfortable
footing with the search for a replacement for Mr Lamberto Dini, who left the
number two job as director-general to become treasury minister. Neither
could agree on who should be the right candidate.
The government was anxious to introduce new blood. Mr Fazio jealously sought
to preserve the central bank's autonomy and promote from within.
This gave way to increased sniping against the bank from members of the
right-wing coalition - notably from the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance.
The bank was accused of being elitist and too closely linked to the outgoing
government.
Matters were made worse by the half-point discount rate increase on August
11 at the height of the government's first lira crisis.
This provoked even more hostile attacks on the bank, including calls to
limit the term of the governor (at present unlimited), rewrite the
institution's statutes and remove Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the former
governor-turned-prime minster, from his position as honorary governor.

Danish unemployment rose to an average 12.5 per cent in July, compared with
12.3 per cent in June, the Danish national statistics office said yesterday.
The seasonally adjusted number of people out of work rose from 344,600
people in June to 349,400 people in July. This also shows a rise from July
1993, when an average 12.4 per cent or 347,100 people were out of work. The
rise follows three months' decline in the jobless rate, after which the
government said the tide had begun to turn on unemployment. It said the rise
was due to many people in new jobs taking summer holidays on unemployment
benefit, as they were not entitled to holiday pay. The opposition Liberals
claimed the government's economic policies had failed. The jobless rate not
corrected for seasonal adjustments was 11.8 per cent in July, up from 11.7
per cent in June.
The trade surplus in the Netherlands in May rose 16 per cent to Fl 2.2bn
(Pounds 815m) from Fl 2bn a year ago, the Dutch government reported.
France's broad M3 money supply aggregate gained 1.2 per cent in July after a
0.3 per cent gain in June, the Bank of France said yesterday. The M3
aggregate was down 3 per cent on an annual basis in July.

There are mounting signs that the international community is preparing to
reward Serbia for its month-long blockade of the Bosnian Serbs and that the
Serbian president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, may be willing to allow
international observers to monitor the embargo. The German foreign minister,
Mr Klaus Kinkel, yesterday said he welcomed a decision by the five members
of the international contact group on Bosnia to ask the UN security council
to discuss easing sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro. In a statement,
Mr Kinkel said Serbia's blockade was a 'positive development' which 'should
be rewarded appropriately'. Mr Kinkel's French counterpart, Mr Alain Juppe,
said on Wednesday that Serbia had agreed in principle to allow non-military
observers to monitor its embargo of the Bosnian Serbs. Mr Juppe said the
details still had to be worked out.

FT  09 SEP 94 / German 'personality' contest: Judy Dempsey reports on
Sunday's two state elections in the east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The outcome of Sunday's elections in the east German states of Brandenburg
and Saxony will depend largely on the personalities of their prime
ministers. Both Mr Manfred Stolpe, the Social Democratic prime minister of
Brandenburg, the only SPD-led government in eastern Germany, and Mr Kurt
Biedenkopf, the Christian Democrat prime minister of Saxony, the only
eastern state with a CDU absolute majority, have tried to use the 'cult of
personality' and local patriotism to secure re-election. But they have gone
about it in different ways.
Mr Stolpe, a 59-year-old Ossi, or easterner, was a senior member of the
Evangelical Church during the former east German communist regime. Since
unification he has been repeatedly accused of collaborating with the former
Stasi, or secret police.
The more the authorities and the west German media tried to prove the
allegations, the more the Brandenburgers rallied around Mr Stolpe. 'Stolpe
is one of us (easterners). We won't let the Wessis (westerners) destroy
him,' say his supporters.
However, after the election the SPD might be forced to choose between a
coalition with the CDU, or the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), the
successor to the former east German communist party, because the Free
Democrats (FDP), the junior coalition partner, might not jump the 5 per cent
hurdle required to enter parliament. Mr Stolpe could have played the
'communist threat' card to galvanise his support. But since he is an Ossi,
he knows how Brandenburgers share a common past. 'He is afraid of sowing
divisions because he knows how old unsettled scores could be revived,' said
an aide.
Mr Biedenkopf has chosen the opposite course. A prominent politician in
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government, the 64-year-old former law professor
fell out with Mr Kohl and sought refuge in Saxony. But Konig (King) Kurt, as
he is known, has used the CDU's absolute majority in Saxony's state
parliament to introduce a government based on law and order and to polarise
society.
The police have powers to detain individuals for up to 14 days for
suspicious behaviour, and bug private homes, while anyone with the slightest
previous connection with the Stasi or the former Communist party has been
sacked or banned from holding jobs in the public administration.
More than 1,000 people have appealed - and won - costing the state DM30m
(Pounds 12.3m) in legal expenses.
But Mr Biedenkopf wants another absolute majority. By accusing the SPD and
PDS of flirting, he has weakened the political middle ground. 'Saxony is now
politically polarised between the CDU and the far-left,' said Mr Fritz
Hahle, the CDU's leader. 'That's good for us. Indeed, this polarisation
might be enough to get us back with the absolute majority.'
But the PDS could, at the expense of the SDP, get about 15 per cent of the
vote in Brandenburg and more than 20 per cent in Saxony.
Such a result would enhance the party's status as 'king-maker' in the
formation of the new governments.
But it would also provide a litmus test for the federal elections which take
place on October 16 and in which the PDS is expecting to enter the
Bundestag.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Balladur unveils plan for tighter defence network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, yesterday issued detailed
proposals for improved defence co-operation between members of the European
Union. He also suggested they negotiate a common security doctrine with
forthcoming EU members in central Europe.
In a speech to France's Institute of Higher Defence Studies, Mr Balladur
said a white paper on European defence could be prepared for a future EU
summit to which leaders of central European states could be invited. Such a
white paper would be 'a first manifestation of the new solidarity' between
the EU and its eastern neighbours.
But he said existing EU states should, in any case, push on with reinforcing
co-operation within the Western European Union organisation, particularly in
planning joint operations and in developing 'a true European system' of
space-based spy satellites.
As the European state with the strongest ambition in the defence field,
France is now at the centre of a web of arrangements with different WEU
partners.
Mr Balladur cited France's joint Eurocorps with Germany, Belgium, Spain and
Luxembourg, its 'rapid reaction force' project with Italy and Spain, and its
'more embryonic' discussions with Britain on joint air force planning. But,
echoing the wider debate over EU integration, he suggested the time might
come for a WEU summit to consolidate the organisation as 'the central core'
of European defence.
In the shorter term, he called on the WEU to use its new planning cell in
Brussels to prepare for joint military-humanitarian operations more
effectively than it had done in Rwanda.
He also called for a European observation satellite system, similar to the
satellite photo interpretation system the WEU had set up in Spain. France is
already working on the Helios optic and infra-red satellites with Spain and
Italy, but Mr Balladur said he was 'counting a lot' on getting German
financial support.
France by itself could not maintain military technology and hardware across
the board, he told his military officers, and so greater collaboration with
other Europeans was essential.
There is anxiety in the French government about the UK government's imminent
choice between joining the project for a new European military transport
aircraft or sticking with Lockheed of the US to fulfil its military
transport needs.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Recovery in Germany gathers pace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
West Germany's economic recovery gained momentum in the second quarter,
growing at a real, adjusted annual rate of more than 2 per cent, thanks
mainly to heavy stock-building and rising exports, according to data from
the federal statistics office.
A surge of almost 9 per cent in the east pushed real, unadjusted pan-German
growth for the first half to 2.8 per cent, and presented a pleasing overall
picture, Mr Gunther Merk, office president, said yesterday.
The data showed recovery in the west and continued strong growth in the east
without any indications of overheating, he said in remarks later echoed by
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister.
Mr Otmar Issing, a Bundesbank director, also showed a relaxed attitude to
price developments, saying that borrowing was under control and that the
rise to 3 per cent in western inflation last month was due to high coffee
and petrol prices which pushed the index up 0.2 per cent.
The decline in inflation had been slowed but not stopped, he said in an
interview with the financial newspaper Borsen Zeitung. Falling unit labour
costs also made an important contribution to price stability, he said.
The recovery would improve companies' cash flow rather than generate heavier
demand for credit, Mr Issing added. His remarks appeared aimed at
reinforcing other comments from the Bundesbank which have suggested there is
still some scope for further reducing short-term interest rates.
According to the statistics office, the western economy, which accounts for
more than 90 per cent of pan-German GDP, grew a fully-adjusted 1 per cent
between the first and second quarters after a 0.5 per cent
quarter-on-quarter improvement in the first three months.
Analysts calculated that stockbuilding accounted for around half a
percentage point of the quarter's annualised growth rate of 2.3 per cent,
but disagreed on whether heavy stocks on hand might signal a slowdown in the
second half.
They were also sceptical of 'political' remarks on overheating, saying it
was too early for inflationary pressures to start showing through.
Yesterday's data suggested the first quarter's heavy demand for new homes
and relatively strong consumer spending had faded in the three months to the
end of July. Although Mr Rexrodt claimed western consumer demand rose 1.5
per cent in the first half, the seasonally adjusted figures showed a real
fall of 1 per cent in the second quarter following a rise of only 0.3 per
cent in the first three months.
Capital investment continued to fall in the review period, although at a far
slower rate. However, as industrial capacity utilisation rises (it is
already estimated to have risen to the long-term average of 83 per cent)
spending on plant is likely to turn up, probably early in the new year.
According to yesterday's data, pan-German labour productivity rose 4.1 per
cent in the first half and unemployment was 15 per cent higher than in the
comparable part of 1993. Wage and salary earners' gross income rose 2.3 per
cent and overall disposable incomes increased 3.4 per cent.
The statistics office also published upward revisions of western GDP data
for the past two years. The economy grew 1.8 per cent in 1992, not 1.6 per
cent as previously stated. It shrank 1.7 per cent in last year's recession,
earlier calculated to have caused a 1.9 per cent contraction.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Berliners say goodbye to Allies: US, British and French
leaders see military presence come to an end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Leaders of Allied countries joined nostalgic Berliners yesterday as the last
American, British and French troops bad farewell to the city after
protecting it for nearly 50 years.
'It will be so difficult to forget the Allies, especially the Americans.
They bombed us during the second world war but in 1948 they dropped parcels
full of food. They kept us alive,' said Mr Helmut Bischof, a 76-year-old
former engineer in the German air force.
The day's events were presided over by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and attended
by President Francois Mitterrand of France, Mr John Major, the British prime
minister, and Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state. At a ceremony at
the Luftbrucken memorial at Tempelhof airport in the south of the city, they
took the salute from units of each of the four countries.
At Tempelhof on June 25, 1948, General Lucius Clay, commander of the US
forces in Berlin, ordered 'Operation Vittles', a massive airlift designed to
feed the west Berliners after Stalin had attempted to take over the entire
city through starving into submission people living in the sectors
controlled by the US, British and French.
'Stalin had tried to intimidate the Berliners. But the resolve of the Allies
and the Berliners' prevented this, said Mr Christopher.
'I remember the airlift so well,' said Mrs Barbara Wagner, an 82-year-old
pensioner. 'On the night of June 23, the lights over our city went out. We
thought we would fall into the hands of the communists. But a few days
later, we heard the hum of Allied aircraft swooping down on Berlin. That was
the best sound I had ever heard in my entire life. I never wanted that sound
to leave the skies over my city.'
Mr Christopher recalled how, at the peak of the airlift, aircraft were
landing every 90 seconds. 'Two million tonnes of supplies were delivered to
Berlin. The roaring engines provided Berliners with hope and reassurance,'
he added.
Mr Kohl, speaking earlier at the Schauspielhaus concert hall in east Berlin,
said when he first visited Berlin in 1947, 'I was 17 years old. . . the city
lay in ruins, the future was uncertain. For almost half a century the three
western Allies protected and defended freedom here in Berlin, in the heart
of our continent.'
The older generation of Berliners regret the departure of the Allies. But
their military presence in the city had already been sharply reduced under
the terms of the unification treaty. The housing, barracks and sport grounds
will revert to the German state, which last year paid nearly DM1bn (Pounds
400m) for the upkeep of the troops. And Berliners, for the first time since
the unification of Germany in 1871, will no longer require an army to subdue
them, or defend them.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Russia glimpses heaven through hell: Economic outlook is
improving, writes John Lloyd, but is fraught with risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A street in central Moscow is cordoned off. The uniformed militia compete to
keep order with big men in suits with walkie-talkies and bulges below their
armpits. A high-ranking delegation is in town: in this case, top executives
from Credit Suisse and its sister company, CS First Boston. They are here to
open their Moscow offices in the street, having refurbished a 19th century
mansion to contain them (and their tenants, who include the International
Monetary Fund).
Mr David Mulford, the former US Treasury undersecretary for international
affairs, now chairman of CS First Boston Ltd, talks of the 'impressive
results' of Russian reform. 'We are investing so much in here because we
think this place could be as big for us as New York or London.'
The prudence of the former public servant constrains him to add: 'Ultimate
success will require steady continued application of policy reform and the
restructuring of Russia's economy if this country is to assume its
appropriate place in the global economy.'
Between the hope and the practice, between the present stability and future
fears, Russian and foreign business people and investors oscillate like iron
filings between magnets. Is it time to invest or to wait? How to evaluate
the government's commitment to reform? How much does it matter?
Much of the present reality is good. Inflation is down from 21 per cent in
January to under 5 per cent last month. The agriculture and energy lobbies
have received extra credits, but these have been relatively restrained.
Privatisation continues, having already brought to market some 70 per cent
of the economy. 'This is a private economy now,' says Mr Kakha Bendukidze,
head of the Nipek Corporation, one of the biggest of Russia's new
businesses. 'The people are owners, even if sometimes they don't know it.'
He, like many other business people, professes not to care too much what the
government does (though he wishes they would tackle organised crime while it
is still possible). He believes the flywheel of the private market is now
turning so swiftly there is little any leader can do to stop it.
Foreign investment in Russian stocks is booming. The demand is such that
Russian financiers like Mr Mikhail Alexandrov of Alpha Capital are spinning
off offshore companies to capture more of the inward flow. Service industry
growth has been very large, compensating, on the official figures, for the
continued steep fall in industrial production.
In the longer term, the scenarios which can be painted are even rosier.
Russia is a fabulously rich, fabulously ill-managed country: with huge oil
and gas reserves of which the first are declining rapidly because they have
been so badly developed and so starved of investment; with deposits of
almost every precious metal and stone which have been subject to an
over-strict monopoly and are now preyed upon by criminals; and with, in the
black-earth zone and elsewhere, tremendously rich farmland which produces at
between a third and a tenth of the productivity of the median European
level. Russia, better run, could be the miracle state of the 21st century -
even, if it hurries, the closing years of the 20th.
But it must go through hell first. The last few weekly meetings of the
special commission on the day-to-day running of the economy, chaired by Mr
Oleg Soskovets, first deputy premier, have seen bitter confrontations
between ministers. Mr Anatoly Chubais, privatisation minister, said on
Wednesday that at the most recent of these sessions, his colleagues had been
'talking about abandoning the course for economic reform' but had been
beaten back.
But for how long? As ministers acknowledge, the boom and evident signs of
wealth are largely confined to Moscow (and, to a lesser extent, St
Petersburg and Ekaterinburg) through which some 70 per cent of financial
transactions are routed. Out in the provinces, the slashing cuts the
government has had to make in the budget, as it fails to collect up to half
its predicted tax revenue, cause real pain.
More is to come. Unemployment is officially low but, according to internal
government forecasts, is likely to turn sharply upwards.
The International Monetary Fund, with a high-level delegation in Moscow this
week for exploratory talks with the government, is deeply worried. It
granted a Dollars 1.5bn systemic transformation facility loan to Russia last
spring, in exchange for promises of budgetary and monetary orthodoxy. The
government has delivered these at least on paper, but has done so by not
paying workers, not supplying the northern cities properly for winter and
not funding capital investment programmes normally considered essential.
How much longer a quiescent society will tolerate such a breach in the
implicit civil contract which exists between a state and its citizens is
perhaps the largest question of the second part of 1994.
In the finance ministry, the clever young ministerial team and its advisers
are trying to keep spending nailed down, while juggling with ideas to get
income up. The tax compliance rates are terrible: the rate on VAT has sunk
from 70 per cent in the first quarter of 1993 to under 40 per cent now;
profit tax from a peak of 90 per cent in the second quarter of 1993 to under
50 per cent; oil excise runs at around 40 per cent, though this has tended
to rise. Only income tax is on track.
The Russian market rollercoaster rolls on, more rapidly than ever. Many
Russians and some foreigners have jumped on, and gone higher than they could
have dreamed. They all expect a descent: how deep and how prolonged is the
unknown.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Foreign investment pours in
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A wave of foreign investment money has swept into Russia this year,
accounting for sharp rises in the shares on Russia's nascent stock markets,
according to local stockbrokers, write John Thornhill and John Lloyd in
Moscow.
Investors have been attracted by the availability of shares following
Russia's mass privatisation programme, the relative success of the economic
stabilisation plan which has reduced inflation to 4 per cent a month, and
the more settled political climate.
Mr Martin Andersson, director of Brunswick, a private Moscow-based finance
company, said: 'There has been a tremendous shift in interest during the
past six to eight months. What we have seen first is an interest from
portfolio investors, mainly from the US. But we are now seeing increased
interest from strategic investors. There have not been tanks on the streets
for several months and there has been a period of relative political
stability.'
Mr Anatoly Chubais, privatisation minister, has estimated that foreign
investors have recently been buying Russian shares at a rate of Dollars 500m
a month. But estimates vary considerably. CS First Boston, the US investment
bank, suggests portfolio investment is running at Dollars 2bn for the first
half of this year; Brunswick estimates Dollars 1bn which might reach Dollars
3bn by year-end.
Local stockbrokers say much of this money comes from speculative hedge funds
seeking an exposure to Russia's developing economy and the commodity cycle.
'This is the ultimate emerging market,' says one stockbroker. Some Russian
flight capital also appears to be returning.
Mr Mikhail Alexandrov, executive director of Alpha Capital, a Russian
stockbroking firm, said: 'You can't easily divide portfolio and strategic
capital coming in. In some industries, like oil, the only way a foreigner
can make an investment is portfolio investment. In others, you can make a
direct stake. We have both coming in now very quickly indeed.'
Most western fund managers are still deterred by the poor transparency in
the share markets and company accounts, the sheer physical difficulty of
buying and registering shares, and the remaining political and economic
risks. But the government is committed to developing and reforming Russia's
capital markets to provide companies with alternative means of finance as it
weens them off state credits.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European Union finance ministers will this weekend hold preliminary talks on
whether to exempt Ireland from the tough rules on government debt in the
Maastricht treaty.
Agreement would set an important precedent in favour of a flexible
interpretation of the criteria laid down in Maastricht for membership of
Europe's planned economic and monetary union. It would also offer hope to
other debt-laden member states such as Belgium and Italy that they too may
receive leniency.
In Brussels this week the secretive European monetary committee, which
comprises the top treasury civil servants in the 12 member states, backed a
European Commission proposal to exempt Ireland. Despite reservations
expressed by the French and German representatives, the Commission is
confident of winning formal approval at a meeting of EU finance ministers on
September 19 for a generous application of the debt rules. Mr Theo Waigel,
the German finance minister playing host to this weekend's informal meeting
of EU finance ministers at Lake Constance, has insisted on strict
application of the Maastricht treaty's rules on debt, deficit, inflation and
currency stability.
But with the general election in Germany barely a month away, Mr Waigel is
likely to steer clear of controversy. At present, only Luxembourg meets the
two deficit criteria of having an annual budget deficit of less than 3 per
cent of gross domestic product and an accumulated debt of less than 60 per
cent of GDP.
The Commission argues that Ireland is a special case because it has kept its
annual budget deficits below 2.5 per cent in recent years, and has reduced
its stock of debt from around 114 per cent of GDP to around 90 per cent of
GDP this year. This appears consistent with the Maastricht treaty provision
which says member states can get round the target if 'the ratio (of debt to
GDP) is sufficiently diminishing and approaching the reference value at a
satisfactory pace'.
Germany, however, remains fearful of encouraging the notion that the
so-called 'convergence criteria' in Maastricht are infinitely flexible. Only
France supported Germany's reservations in the monetary committee this week,
apparently because Paris is determinedly orthodox and wary of any move which
might undermine Bonn's commitment to a single European currency. Britain
remained silent, according to a participant.
Assuming EU finance ministers agree later this month to exempt Ireland and
Luxembourg, they will start 'excessive deficit' proceedings against the 10
other EU member states. This means setting policy recommendations for
reducing debt which could take the form of targets for 1995. Italy and
Greece are viewed as particularly thorny cases.
Setting debt reduction targets could provoke charges of Commission
heavy-handedness from finance ministers who want to take credit for tough
measures to tackle deficits.
The Commission could soft-pedal by simply urging member states to meet debt
reduction targets which they have set out in their own 'convergence
programmes'. These are the action plans which are subject to scrutiny by the
EU's monetary committee and the Council of Ministers.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Brussels court orders arrest of Groupe Schneider chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BRUSSELS, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A Brussels court issued an international arrest warrant yesterday for Mr
Didier Pineau-Valencienne, the chairman of Groupe Schneider, one of France's
largest electrical groups.
The court order could provoke further strains between France and Belgium
over the fate of Mr Pineau-Valencienne, who faces charges of fraud and
embezzlement relating to two of Groupe Schneider's Belgian subsidiaries.
Schneider's shares fell sharply on news of the warrant's issue. The shares
closed FFr7.70 down at FFr399.50, having dropped to a low of FFr387 during
the day.
French law does not permit the extradition of French citizens, but a Belgian
justice ministry official said last night: 'If Pineau-Valencienne goes
anywhere outside France, he will be arrested.'
Schneider last night issued a statement describing the warrant as 'totally
illegal'.
Mr Jean-Michel Loyrette, the lawyer representing Mr Pineau-Valencienne, said
his client would not comply with the warrant, which followed the Schneider
group chairman's boycott of a court hearing in Brussels last Saturday.
Late last month, the group announced that Mr Pineau-Valencienne would not
attend any of the Belgian hearings on the grounds that his detention for 12
days in a Brussels jail earlier this summer was unlawful. He was ready to
co-operate with the Belgian authorities, but only in France under the
supervision of French legal authorities.
Mr Pineau-Valencienne's failure to appear before the Belgian investigating
magistrate means he faces the loss of BFr15m (Pounds 300m) in bail,
according to an official at the Belgian justice ministry. Mr
Pineau-Valencienne faces charges relating to complaints filed by minority
shareholders in Cofimines and Cofibel, two Belgian financial subsidiaries of
Schneider.
Belgian prosecutors say that assets worth about BFr4.8bn were concealed from
shareholders and regulators, and that dividends from offshore companies
belonging to the subsidiaries were not distributed to all shareholders.
The arrest warrant comes at a time of fierce controversy about white-collar
crime in France. He is one of several prominent industrialists recently
placed under investigation including Mr Jean-Louis Beffa, chairman of
Saint-Gobain.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Unions may join Channel tunnel link consortium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR and CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trade unions have been invited to join one of the four consortium bids to
build the Pounds 2.7bn Channel tunnel rail link from Folkestone to London,
it was announced yesterday.
The German multinational conglomerates Hochtief and Siemens in alliance with
Costain, the UK construction company, want the GMB general union, the TGWU
general union and the three rail unions to form a 'social partnership' with
them to construct the 68-mile link, which is expected to create about 10,000
jobs.
Mr John Edmonds, the GMB's general secretary, said he was 'very excited' by
the project. His union is expected to join the consortium whatever the other
unions may decide to do. 'This is the first time we have ever been
approached by a private company to become involved in such a business
project,' he said.
Others involved in the consortia are Nishimatsu, the Japanese construction
company; Hambros Bank and John Prideaux Associates. Mr Edmonds would not
disclose at this stage the amount of money the GMB was prepared to invest in
the bid. Nor would he reveal details of the consortium proposals. However,
he stressed it was the symbolic significance of union involvement in the
project that really mattered.
'This is the reality of European social partnership arriving on our shores,'
he said. 'We have been invited to participate and to contribute money
because the companies recognise that working together is better for business
and employees. This type of relationship is common on the Continent and the
social partnership between unions and companies will be the industrial
relations model of the future.
'The prize is enormous. It means the unions can get involved from the very
beginning in the training, management and health and safety aspects of the
project.
'In the past we have had to barge in through the back door in such schemes.
The potential value for the members in the union being part of the
consortium is tremendous.'
All the unions concerned attended a presentation of the project made by the
consortium in Blackpool earlier this week. The others have yet to respond to
the proposal.
The final decision from the British government on who will be chosen to
build the link is expected by the autumn of next year and the plan is that
the line will be completed in 2003.
British unions believe the companies want their involvement partly because
tough European Commission building site safety regulations are coming into
force on January 1. They believe close co-operation with the unions is seen
as necessary to ensure the project is trouble-free.
Members of the Hochtief-led consortium said they could not comment on the
union statement because they had signed confidentiality agreements.
But sources close to the consortium said that an invitation had been made to
unions with the aim of creating favourable industrial relations on the
project.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Forte closer to winning battle for control of Savoy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Forte company's 13-year battle to take control of the Savoy Hotel group
appeared closer to success last night with the expected departure over the
next few days of Mr Giles Shepard, Savoy's managing director and Forte's
arch foe.
The Savoy board is unlikely, however, to announce a final peace agreement
between the two sides when it meets next Tuesday. Instead, it is expected to
try to find replacements for Mr Shepard and for Sir Anthony Tuke, the
chairman, who wants to retire.
The board, under new leadership, would then resume discussions on merging
Savoy's hotels - including the Savoy, Claridge's and the Connaught - with
Forte's luxury establishments.
Mr Shepard's position has been weak for some time because of Savoy's poor
financial performance. The group's pre-tax profits last year were only
Pounds 725,000 on turnover of Pounds 83.3m.
A further deterioration in Mr Shepard's prospects became apparent on Tuesday
at a meeting between Sir Anthony, Mr Rocco Forte, Forte's chairman, and Mr
John Sinclair, a Savoy director and the representative of Wontner family
trusts which hold a stake in the company.
The meeting is believed to have discussed press coverage of the alleged
leaking of a report compiled by Mr Shepard, which outlined the case for
Savoy's continued independence from Forte.
Mr Shepard issued a statement on Sunday which said: 'The board of the Savoy
group is dismayed that one non-executive director, for his own reasons, has
decided to discuss confidential papers with the press.' The statement was
seen as a reference to Sir Michael Richardson, a Savoy director.
On Monday, Mr Shepard admitted that he had made the statement on his own
initiative and that the board had taken no position on the matter. Sir
Michael denied leaking the report. Sir Anthony accepted Sir Michael's denial
and described Mr Shepard's statement as 'extraordinary'. Mr Shepard
yesterday declined to comment.
Mr Sinclair, who has been mentioned as a possible replacement for either Sir
Anthony or Mr Shepard, is now regarded as unlikely to be appointed to either
position. Supporters of Mr Sinclair's appointment to a senior position in
the group point out that he has wide experience of the hotel industry.
However, as the trustee responsible for the interests of the Wontner family,
hotel industry sources believe he would regard it as inappropriate for him
to take either the chairmanship or the managing director's position.
Sir Hugh Wontner was president of Savoy until his death in 1992. The Wontner
trusts control a crucial block of shares. Allied with Forte, they would give
the latter control of Savoy.
Talks between Forte and the Wontner trusts are likely to continue after the
board meeting.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Loyalist gunmen set out terms for ceasefire: Statement
raises hopes of peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BELFAST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Northern Ireland's loyalist paramilitaries yesterday set out their terms for
an end to terrorism in response to the IRA's ceasefire declaration, raising
the prospect of a permanent end to 25 years of political violence in the
province.
The Combined Loyalist Military Command, which represents the Ulster
Volunteer Force and the Ulster Freedom Fighters, the two main terror groups,
stopped short of offering an immediate cessation of violence.
But it promised 'a meaningful contribution towards peace' once it is certain
that the IRA ceasefire is permanent, that the Irish National Liberation Army
has ended violence; that no secret deals have been struck with the
republicans; and that Ulster's position within the UK is assured.
The statement was dismissed as 'inadequate' by the Northern Ireland Office.
Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, said the IRA 'has had the courage to
take the initiative. The government and the loyalists have not'.
Alderman Hugh Smyth, the Lord Mayor of Belfast, said the statement suggested
that a ceasefire was possible if the loyalists received the right answers
from the government and republicans.
The loyalist command gave no timetable for a ceasefire. It said the decision
would depend on the implications of the framework document for Northern
Ireland's future being drawn up by the British and Irish governments as part
of the peace process, which is unlikely to be published for several weeks.
'Change, if any, can only be honourable after dialogue and agreement. It is
important that patience is shown to this body given the gravity of the
debate required,' the command said.
The announcement followed assurances to unionists from Mr Malcolm Rifkind,
defence secretary, that the number of British troops in Northern Ireland
would not be reduced until the government was sure that terrorism had ended.
'The crucial requirement is to ensure the security of the people of Northern
Ireland is fully protected, and that is a judgment that has to be looked at
very, very carefully,' Mr Rifkind said, during a visit to Berlin.
He said a 'gradual reduction' in the military presence would only happen
when violence had ended for a 'considerable' time. 'I am not envisaging any
immediate changes of that kind'.
His comments contrasted sharply with Wednesday's announcement by Sir Patrick
Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, that security was being scaled down.
Troops have discarded steel helmets in favour of berets.
Mr Martin McGuinness, a member of Sinn Fein's executive, said Mr Rifkind's
comments were 'particularly unimaginative and arrogant'. The presence of
British soldiers was 'particularly provocative at this time'.
Republican sources said that the combination of the government's cautious
approach to security and the loyalist terrorists' delay in declaring a
ceasefire would put pressure on the internal discipline of the IRA.
However, security sources believe that the ceasefire will hold as long as
the peace initiative progresses at government level. They also believe that
loyalist violence can be contained.
A source close to the loyalist paramilitaries said that the combined
command's statement was part of a two-track strategy. The source said that
loyalist terrorists wanted to play a part in discussions on Ulster's future,
while leaving the option of violence open in case unionists felt threatened
by the IRA.

Weak milk margins hit Avonmore Foods, the expanding Irish dairy and meat
processor, which yesterday reported a 9 per cent drop in interim pre-tax
profits to IPounds 10.1m (Pounds 9.99m) on sales 15 per cent ahead at
IPounds 592m.
Mr John Duggan, chairman, said international markets for dairy products had
yielded noticeably lower returns in the first half.
'This impacted adversely on margins in the Irish milk business,' he said.
As a result, the dairy division's operating profit rose just 8.7 per cent to
IPounds 8.46m, on a 36 per cent jump in sales to IPounds 320.4m.
Sales were boosted by the acquisition in July last year of the Dairy Crest
liquid milk business. Mr Duggan said the division had also suffered an
adverse impact from the longer-than-expected integration of the liquid milk
operations in the south of England.
The meat operation was hit by weaker markets throughout Europe, particularly
in Germany.
Profits fell from IPounds 3.9m to IPounds 2.8m on sales down by 5 per cent
at IPounds 204.4m.
Profits in the agricultural business fell from IPounds 5.91m to IPounds 5.4m
on sales up by IPounds 3.2m to IPounds 67.3m.
The dividend was increased by 6.5 per cent to 1.65p. Earnings per share fell
almost 11 per cent to 4.8p.
CORRECTION
In yesterday's FT it was reported that Avonmore Foods had issued a profits
warning. While the company reported a reduction of 9 per cent in pre-tax
profits for the first half of the year, it did not issue a warning about
future profits.

FT  09 SEP 94 / (CORRECTED) Management: A special City club - A group of
black City workers tell Joel Kibazo why their forum can benefit everyone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 16th September 1994) appended to this article.
Phillip Wright, loans manager at Banco di Sicilia, an Italian banking group,
reflects on his 23 years of working in the City of London. 'I've seen racism
in the City, no doubt about it. I think I could have done better had I been
white given my experience and the work I've done.'
He adds: 'The only reason I've survived is because I've played the game, but
guys I've worked with at the same level over the years now earn double what
I earn so things haven't changed that much.'
It was an attempt to change the way that black people working in the world
of business and finance are perceived that Wright and several other black
professionals came together to form the African &amp; Caribbean Finance Forum
(ACFF) four years ago.
The group now has 70 individual members, drawn mainly from the world of
banking and finance, although there are plans to extend the catchment to
other areas of business and outside London.
Paul Campayne, a bond strategist at Paribas Capital Markets and current
chairman of the ACFF, says: 'Several black people had been meeting
informally since the early 1970s so we decided to put a structure to an
informal network.'
The aim of the forum, he says, is to advance, develop and promote black
people in the world of finance and business. That has so far mainly been
carried out through networking of members and non-members by which 'we offer
each other expertise about our work experiences and a shoulder to cry on if
necessary. The idea is to pull each other along', says Campayne.
Seminars are also held, addressed in the main by black British luminaries
such as Diane Abbott, MP for Hackney South, and broadcaster Trevor Phillips,
head of current affairs programmes at London Weekend Television.
The speaker at a seminar in June was Courtney Blackman, a former governor of
the Central Bank of Barbados, and in July the group held a weekend workshop
on career planning.
Campayne is sensitive to charges that the ACFF could be seen as a separatist
organisation. He says: 'There are a lot of city clubs and societies. We are
no different from those. What we are about is enhancing black people's
ability to get on in the business and financial world. We want to try to
open as many doors as possible. We welcome anybody who wishes to help us
further our objectives.'
The ACFF believes it has a strategic role to play, particularly among
potential employers, and is especially keen on personal and career
development - for both black and white staff.
Campayne says: 'As a group we have a lot of expertise in various fields and
there is no reason why an employer wishing to send a signal to the rest of
the staff can not use one of us. For the black members of staff, often in
very junior positions, they would have a role model. For white staff and
management, it would show there are black people with professional skills
that can actually do things.'
ACFF is also keen to highlight its potential to act as ambassador for the
business and finance world to the black community as a whole and the younger
generation in particular. Committee members have visited Middlesex and
Coventry universities to speak to black and other ethnic minority students.
'There are still very few black people working in this area so we say to
young black students 'you too can have a career in finance and business.
This is how you go about it'.'
Business and financial institutions have been eager to embrace the group and
this year Midland, National Westminster, Barclays and Standard Chartered
banks signed up as corporate members. Other institutions have also lent a
helping hand. The Banking Information Service helped with printing material
while the Bank of England and Bankers Trust have provided venues for
meetings.
Andi Constantinides, equal opportunities manager at Midland Bank, the
group's first corporate member, believes membership provides a useful link
with its staff. 'We can use it as a sounding board for ideas on equal
opportunities, while the staff can use the forum to share their experiences
at Midland and learn about experiences elsewhere. We also hope to use it in
devising in-house seminars and conferences,' she says.
Midland plans to hold an evening reception soon when it will introduce its
black staff to the ACFF.
For David May, head of equal opportunities at National Westminster, which
became a corporate member in July, there is a double reason for joining. Not
only does it 'give us an opportunity to develop an understanding of this
important group of professionals', but it also 'gives a clear corporate
message to our existing and potential staff that we value people's
individuality'.
The forum says several employers have expressed interest in ACFF, helping
them to find black professionals and managers. A committee member says:
'There are companies that want to broaden the background of their employees
but have simply not known how to go about it.'
Black professional groups have long been a feature of the US corporate
sector, as have affirmative action programmes to assist black people to
advance up the corporate ladder. The ACFF has already been in touch with
counterparts in the US but dismisses calls for affirmative action in the UK.
Alan Smith, a manager in the regulatory advisory unit of the financial
sector group at KPMG Peat Marwick, and a committee member, says: 'I don't
believe in affirmative action. It is only useful in extreme circumstances.
It can do more harm especially when simply increasing the number of black
people employed is the objective, rather than to get good people. We are
focusing on the talent there is and inviting the British corporate sector to
take advantage of it.'
Campayne says: 'There are things we can learn from the Americans but you
can't just transport an American model here. The circumstances are
different.'
Raymond Whyte, a manager in the international trade and finance division of
Standard Chartered Bank, has been working in the City for more than 15
years. He says: 'Things are changing in the City but we as a group are here
to help that process along. I'd like to see us become an established part of
the City and the business world.'
CORRECTION
Phillip Wright, whose comments were reported in an article on Sept 9 ('A
special City club'), was not at the time employed at Banco di Sicilia, and
is not due to commence employment there until 26 September. Banco di Sicilia
is an equal opportunities employer and is in no way associated with the
comments made.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Mercury set to offer cheaper mobile calls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercury One-2-One, the mobile phone operator, is set to increase competition
in the business telecommunications market today with a new daytime service
undercutting prices charged by British Telecommunications.
The service, which will be available only within the M25 area initially, is
likely to offer One-2-One callers prices of up to 15 per cent below BT's,
provided they make their calls from within a narrow designated area.
When One-2-One launched its network last autumn it offered free local calls
in the evening in a bid to sell itself to consumers deterred by the expense
of mobile phones.
The new service is an attempt to spread the same message to the medium- and
small-business sector, which has until now also been wary of cellular
phones.
The overall cost of joining the One-2-One network is significantly higher
than that charged by BT. Its cellular handsets retail at Pounds 200 or more,
with annual connection and subscription charges of a similar order.
However, One-2-One's move is set to stimulate greater competition between
the UK's four mobile phone net-works.
Pressure will be strong on the other network operators - Vodafone, Cellnet
and Orange - to respond with price cuts, although they trade on the wider
geographical coverage that is available on their networks.
One-2-One, a joint venture between Mercury Communications and US West, a
regional US phone company, launched its network a year ago and has about
120,000 subscribers. The UK's four cellular networks together have about
2.7m subscribers.

Farmers and villagers in Otterburn, Northumberland are to petition the
Commons for the removal of the Ministry of Defence's Otterburn Training Area
from designation as part of the Northumberland National Park.
The petitioners, who estimate the army's presence is worth Pounds 6m a year
to the local economy, are worried that recent criticism by environmentalists
of the presence of military training in the national park could jeopardise
the future of the artillery ranges, which date from 1911.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Ozone layer set to recover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The earth's protective ozone layer will reach its lowest level around the
turn of the century and is then expected to recover gradually to near-normal
levels within about 50 years, according to the latest scientific assessment
of ozone depletion released this week by the World Meteorological
Organisation and the UN Environment Programme, Frances Williams reports from
Geneva.
The assessment confirms that international action to curb production of
ozone-depleting chemicals such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) has already
begun to slow the build-up of these chemicals in the atmosphere.
However, it warns that 'the ozone layer's most vulnerable period still lies
ahead' and that the expected recovery is contingent on strict adherence by
all nations to the Montreal Protocol which bans production of CFCs after
1995.

FT  08 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Index surprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CLARE GASCOIGNE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A surprise result in the latest changes to the FT-SE 100 Index came too late
in the day to affect the relevant stocks, but dealers said several big
investors were put off their stride by the inclusion in the index of
investment group 3i rather than Eurotunnel.
It had been widely anticipated that the Channel tunnel group would join
merchant bank Schroders in the leading index, replacing textiles group Coats
Viyella and freight company NFC. A number of tracking funds which link
investments closely to the Footsie had apparently already bought Eurotunnel
stock to adjust their holdings.
However, a spokesman for the FT-SE steering committee said that as the
Eurotunnel Units represented a combination of French and British stock the
capitalisation was halved to give an appropriate weighting.
Coats Viyella, which announced the appointment of Lord Owen to the board,
eased a half-penny to 222 1/2 p, while NFC shed 2 to 170p following a fall
in nine-month restated profits to Pounds 76.8m from Pounds 116.3m
previously. Eurotunnel was a penny off at 284p and 3i slipped 2 1/2 to 319p,
while Schroders edged up 2 to 1535p.
The world's biggest mining company, RTZ, advanced 13 to 885p after producing
first-half figures above market forecasts. The group announced a 30 per cent
rise in adjusted earnings to Pounds 242m, against forecasts of between
Pounds 195m and Pounds 215m.
Analysts raised full-year predictions by some Pounds 70m. For example, SGST
moved its figure to Pounds 530m from Pounds 460m.
RTZ's paying of a foreign income dividend had distorted the figures by
lowering the tax charge, but underlying profits were still up by 20 per cent
against market expectations of about a 15 per cent increase.
More details of share buy-backs and the appearance of the rumoured
cost-reduction programme at Midlands Electricity kept the regional
electricity stocks bubbling away.
London Electricity just edged out Midlands as the sector's best performer,
with London closing 21 higher at 721p and Midlands 20 ahead at 819p.
Midlands said its cost reduction plans would be worth around Pounds 30m over
the next two years. Manweb, which announced a similar move on Tuesday,
jumped 11 more to 862p.
There were more share buy-backs announced yesterday by South Wales
Electricity, which said it had picked up a further 100,000 shares late on
Monday at 815p. South Wales shares advanced 13 to 830p.
There were also strong performances from Eastern, up 9 more at 797p, Norweb,
12 higher at 817p, and Southern, which rose 13 to 780p.
The Scottish generators suffered yet more weakness ahead of the pricing
review, which was said to be imminent. Hydro-Electric lost 10 at 388p and
Power 9 at 390p.
National Westminster was the outstanding stock in a bank sector still
attracting plenty of attention from the big institutions. The shares rose 7
to 518p, helped by a positive recommendation from Credit Lyonnais Laing,
whose banks team pinpointed the stock as a particular beneficiary of higher
base rates.
The market gave a grudging response to the interim profits improvement at
Hillsdown Holdings, with dealers marking the shares up to 185p immediately
the results were announced before chopping them back to their overnight
level of 181p.
Ms Arabella Cecil, food manufacturing analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing,
described the figures as 'satisfactory rather than exciting', but remained
bullish of the stock. 'We continue to expect a 10 per cent-plus rerating
over the next 12 months as consistent results are delivered and the dividend
resumes growth.' Ms Cecil cautioned, however, that the stock would be low on
short term thrills.
Dalgety receded 4 to 485p amid talk of a James Capel sell recommendation.
Cadbury Schweppes rose 5 to 472p, helped by a Strauss Turnbull buy
recommendation in front of interim figures expected this morning.
Nurdin &amp; Peacock put on 6 at 183p in the wake of the well received interims,
which included a 5 per cent increase in the dividend.
Engineering group BBA managed to overcome an initially unfavourable reaction
to its interim profits, which more than halved because of a Pounds 15m
exceptional litigation charge.
The market was pleased with the progress the group has made and encouraged
by management's reiteration of target margins of 10 per cent. The stock put
on 9 at 198p on high volume of 3.8m.
Nervousness surrounded GKN, which declined 9 to 614p. There was rumoured to
be a block of 1m shares in the market and few takers.
Simon Engineering suffered, in spite of reducing first-half losses, the
shares dipping 4 to 110p. 'It is difficult to see any value short of
breaking the group up,' said one analyst.
Profit-taking took 4 1/4 off British Steel at 153 1/2 p. The stock has lost
7 since Monday, sparked by downbeat price comments made by ASW when
announcing its results on Monday.
Arjo Wiggins, the paper group, improved 7 1/2 to 279p ahead of interim
figures due today. Bowater remained strong, closing 6 up at 498p.
Encouraging figures from Portals, the banknote paper maker, saw the shares
jump 20 to 675p. Interim profits rose 20 per cent to Pounds 16.2m.
Anagen, the medical diagnostic group, forged ahead 13 to 65p after
announcing that the US Food and Drug Administration had approved its
automated immunoassay system.

FT  08 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Rerating seen at Ladbroke
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CLARE GASCOIGNE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hotels and leisure group Ladbroke put on the best individual performance in
the FT-SE 100 list as the market responded to an overnight surge on Wall
Street in the share price of Hilton Hotels, which jumped almost 10 per cent.
Ladbroke owns the Hilton brand name outside the US.
Dealers were quick to lift the Ladbroke share price, citing rumours of a
possible break-up of the US Hilton group as possibly signalling a
significant rerating of Ladbroke.
Mr Alasdair McNee, an analyst at Yamaichi Europe, said the market was taking
the view that Ladbroke's recent move back into casino gambling, after a
15-year absence, via its acquisition of three casinos last week, could also
promote an upgrading. Casinos contribute more than 50 per cent of Hilton
Hotels' profits in the US, the analyst said.
Ladbroke acquired the three casinos, Maxim's, the Golden Horseshoe and
Charlie Chester's, from Mr Trevor Hemmings, who became one of Ladbroke's
biggest shareholders following the deal.
Ladbroke shares closed 5 higher at 169p after good turnover of 5.4m.

FT  08 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Interest rate worries again sap early
confidence - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Interest rate worries continued to cast their spell over the UK stock market
yesterday as investors speculated over the progress of the monthly policy
meeting between the UK chancellor of the exchequer and the Governor of the
Bank of England.
A firm opening by share prices melted away and, although UK government bonds
resisted easier trends in other global bond markets, the FT-SE 100-share
Index slipped into negative territory at the close, and was not helped by an
early fall of 8.75 on the Dow Industrial Average.
Nervousness over UK base rates increased after the Halifax Building Society,
Britain's biggest home mortgage lender, admitted to significantly reduced
confidence in housing industry prospects, and warned of the likely effects
of any rise in rates. Reported comments from a Bundesbank council member
that rates could still fall in Germany appeared to land on deaf ears.
The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 at 3,203.9, a net 1.5 down, after a
slow but steady reversal of an early improvement of nearly 14 points which
reflected an initial recovery in German bonds from the falls of the previous
day.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index lost 3.3 at 3,779.1. Trading volume increased to
635.2m shares through the Seaq electronic network, more than 10 per cent up
from Tuesday's figure, when retail, or customer, business stayed high at a
worth of Pounds 1.39bn.
While many strategists doubted suggestions that the UK authorities might
decide on a pre-emptive rise in base rates, it was generally agreed that the
possibility would at least find an airing at yesterday's meeting between Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the Bank of England
Governor.
There was little buying strength behind the initial advance by equities and
trading volume appeared to increase as the market turned back. The
relatively high level of retail activity this week indicates that the big
investment institutions are trading in equities, albeit cautiously, and
appear to be unloading some stock. However, fund managers seem to have been
reshaping portfolios rather than selling shares, and many analysts expect a
further move forward by the stock market.
While corporate profits statements remained favourable, and were, in the
case of RTZ, accompanied by a higher dividend payout, the market overall was
no longer responsive. A sharp rise in RTZ, which is regarded as a good guide
to global economic activity, had little effect elsewhere. Strategists
commented that the UK stock market, which has been driven for some months by
rising company dividends and earnings, appears now to be turning its
attention back to the interest rate front.
Market indices benefited from strength in oil shares - where recent
recommendations from London brokerage houses outweighed any effects of the
settlement of the Nigerian strike - and also in bank stocks.
But an attempted recovery by some retail stocks failed as investors again
reacted to the implications of the threat to domestic consumer spending of
an upward move in UK interest rates. Several store shares lost early gains
and the sector turned easier in the wake of the comments from the chairman
of the Halifax.
There was no immediate response from the stock market to the lifting of the
Malaysian ban on UK trade, although several leading UK firms will hope to be
allowed to tender for work on Malaysia's new international airport, a
project from which they were originally excluded.
The FT-SE 100-share Index Steering Committee announced yesterday that
Schroders and 3i Group will join the Footsie index on September 19, and that
NFC and Coats Viyella will leave.

FT  08 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLARE GASCOIGNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Technical trading ahead of next Friday's expiry of the September FT-SE 100
Index futures contract dominated an otherwise steady day of consolidation
that gave some relief from the nervousness seen on Tuesday, writes Clare
Gascoigne.
Volume in the September contract was significant at 19,160 lots, but it was
the December contract that saw the greatest change in turnover. Volume was
more than doubled to 9,826, compared with only 4,072 the previous day, as
traders began to roll over positions from the September to December
contracts.
September opened steadily at 3,213, but then moved up rapidly to 3,227 by
mid-morning, the high for the day.
However, a slow drift down began soon after, and the contract closed at
3,206 - spot on its fair value premium to the underlying cash market of 3
points.
Once again, 3,200 proved the testing ground; the September contract touched
its lowest point at this level and traded under 3,210 for most of the day.
Volume was also high in traded options, with total turnover reaching 39,939
lots, of which 10,898 were in the FT-SE 100 option.
The most actively traded stock options were British Steel at 2,750 contracts
and HSBC at 2,068.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Warsaw's Wig index, already down by 55 per cent from its peak in March, has
been under pressure again this week as foreign and local investors found
their own reasons to shun the market.
Foreign investors have been keeping a wary eye on the growing row over the
independent role of the central bank, while local investors have been
sidetracked by a heavy calendar of new issues and privatisation offers,
which will culminate with the sale of the large state-owned Bank
Przemyslowo-Handlowy, probably in December.
However, Mr Stephen Pettyfer at Smith New Court believes that some respite
could be at hand. He notes that next week should bring the resolution of
Poland's bank debt restructuring with its London Club creditors, while
restrictions on foreign purchases of shares in a number of strategically
important companies should also be lifted. In addition, the local market
will be receiving refunds after the oversubscribed privatisation of
Stalexport, the foreign trade enterprise. Smith expects the Wig index to
trade between its current level, of 9,274 points, and 13,500 points until
the end of the year.

FT  08 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Second-tier data fail to
effect sentiment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Blue chips retreated yesterday, but technology issues forged ahead in spite
of a sagging bond market, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 12.45 off at 3,886.25, near to its
worst level of the day. But the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was
down just 0.90 at 470.96. By the close the Big Board was showing nearly as
many rising issues as falls.
After Tuesday's sluggish session, New York SE volume picked up to a fairly
active 292m shares, even though many investors were taking the day off in
observance of Rosh Hashanan, the Jewish new year.
In the secondary markets, the Nasdaq composite outperformed other leading
indices, climbing 4.80 to 764.28 on the back of a firming trend in
technology stocks. The American SE composite managed to add 0.68 at 455.32.
The morning brought a smattering of second-tier economic data, none of which
had much influence on market sentiment.
In a mildly unfavourable development, the Labor Department revised downwards
its estimate of the decline in second-quarter non-farm productivity to 2.5
per cent, the largest drop since the first three months of 1989. Meanwhile,
the increase in unit labour costs were revised upwards to 3.4 per cent,
suggesting stronger inflationary pressures.
That news, coupled with higher commodity prices, offered bond traders no
encouragement to buy ahead of Friday's keenly awaited producer price data.
As a consequence, the long end of the Treasury yield curve suffered moderate
losses, with many accounts preferring to stay on the sidelines until after
the release of the inflation report.
After a static morning, the similar trend was evident among the Dow
industrials. The decline was led by DuPont, off Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 58
7/8 , and United Technologies, down Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 33.
In the oil group, Texaco gained Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 62 1/8 , while Arco
jumped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 106 3/8 .
The retailing sector showed a spark of life. Circuit City Stores, a home
electronics chain, climbed Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 26 after announcing that
sales in outlets opened at least a year had risen 16 per cent last month.
The company also forecast a 27 per cent surge in net income in its current
fiscal quarter.
On the negative side, shares in Jones Apparel dropped Dollars 2 to Dollars
23 1/8 on a downgrading by Merrill Lynch. The company's outlook was clouded
by the resignation of its president, announced a day earlier.
Warner-Lambert, the drugs and consumer products marketer, continued to be
buffeted by takeover speculation. Yesterday profit-takers prevailed, pushing
it down Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 80 3/4 .
The technology sector was the liveliest of a rather lacklustre lot. Stocks
across the board were showing solid gains, although analysts were unable to
link the improvement to any specific development. In semiconductors, Texas
Instruments improved Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 75 1/2 .
On the Nasdaq, Lotus Development jumped Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 44 1/2 ,
Cyrix added Dollars 2 1/4 at Dollars 40 1/8 and Intel appreciated Dollars 1
1/8 to Dollars 66 3/8 .
Canada
A late afternoon rally on the Toronto market erased more than half of an
early fall for the TSE 300 index, which finished a net 8.10 down at 4,339.07
after touching 4,327.43.
Declines finally led gains by 399 to 366 after moderate volume of 59.3m
shares.
An analyst said that besides the traditional September doldrums, the
upcoming release of August inflation figures - the US producer price index
on Friday and Canada's consumer price index next week - and next Monday's
election in Quebec could make for a lacklustre market this week.
Nine of the 14 sub-indices were lower, with chemical and forestry shares
leading the declines while transportation and conglomerates were the best
performers. The golds group built on Tuesday's rise, adding 0.3 per cent as
the New York spot bullion price put on USDollars 2 at USDollars 390.25 an
ounce.
Mexico
Shares closed higher in a continuation of the technical rebound that began
on Tuesday after eight straight losing sessions.
The IPC index moved forward 34.85, or 1.29 per cent, to 2,738.92 as the
market ignored a third consecutive weekly rise in the bellwether 28-day
cetes - or treasury bill - rates.

FT  08 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Japan Telecom drop
depresses confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A plunge in Japan Telecom shares depressed confidence, and the Nikkei 225
average lost 1.8 per cent, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index ended 370.18 down at the day's low of 20,023.80. It opened at the
session's best of 20,364.47 and slid as the fall in JT prompted selling of
other telecommunications stocks. Buying by public pension and insurance
funds supported the index above the 20,000 level, but traders expected a
further decline in JT to weigh on prices this week.
Volume rose from 222m to 315m shares. The Topix index of all first section
issues fell 27.09, or 1.7 per cent, to 1,586.06, closing below 1,600 for the
first time since May. The Nikkei 300 retreated 4.72 to 289.15. Losers
outnumbered gainers by 1,007 to 59, with 116 issues unchanged. In London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index was off 0.57 at 1,291.99.
Investors were also refraining from trading ahead of the futures and options
settlements on Friday, while worries over US-Japan framework talks on trade
and its effects on the currency market also weighed on confidence.
On the second section, JT dropped Y220,000, or 4.7 per cent, to Y4.43m.
Traders said the stock, now 5.7 per cent lower than its public offer price,
was considered too expensive.
Telecommunications linked shares, bought by dealers and individuals ahead of
the JT listing, were dragged down. DDI dipped Y45,000 to Y903,000 and Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Y10,000 to Y883,000. East Japan Railway, a
privatised stock and a shareholder of JT, receded Y8,000 to Y505,000 on
foreign selling.
Arbitrage unwinding linked to the Topix index depressed banks, which are
heavily weighted in the average. Sumitomo Bank declined Y50 to Y1,840 and
Mitsubishi Bank Y60 to Y2,440.
Steels lost ground in busy trading. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of
the day, slipped Y5 to Y367.
High-technology issues were lower on profit-taking. Sony lost Y100 at Y5,850
and NEC Y10 at Y1,200. Automakers also declined, with Nissan Motor closing
Y23 down at Y739.
In Osaka, the OSE average weakened 335.67 to 22,299.62 in volume of 85.7m
shares.
Roundup
Company news moved shares, and markets, around the Pacific Rim.
HONG KONG noted active switching from expensive blue chips to second liners,
particularly China-owned stocks, for the second day in a row, but continued
fund buying still took the Hang Seng index up 129.90, or 1.3 per cent, to
10,165.87, in turnover more than doubled at HKDollars 7.7bn.
The H share index soared 51 points, or 3.6 per cent, to 1,450.49. Meanwhile,
the China-backed vitamin C maker China Pharmaceutical rose 11 cents, or 10.7
per cent, to a year's high of HKDollars 1.135 in late trade as analysts said
rotational buying of China-linked laggards had boosted demand for the stock.
TAIPEI was lifted by last minute, heavy buying in financials which took the
weighted index up 65.46 to 6,895.93, as turnover increased from TDollars
57bn to TDollars 77.8bn.
Speculative buying focused on the Big Three banks before their shareholders'
meetings scheduled for October, Hua Nan soaring by the daily 7 per cent
limit to TDollars 205.
KARACHI saw buying of cement stocks by overseas investors on the new account
day, and the KSE 100 index advanced 10.35 to 2,186.18.
COLOMBO closed higher for the fourth day in a row and, in spite of
profit-taking, the all-share index moved ahead 15.61 to 1,130.36.
MANILA tumbled at the close as Petron, the oil refiner making its debut on
the Philipine Stock Exchange, drew investors away from declining blue chips.
The composite index shed 46.16 to 3,040.32.
Petron hit a high of 22.75 pesos before finishing at 21.25 pesos, 136 per
cent above its offer price of 9 pesos a share. Because of the Petron
euphoria the index heavyweight PLDT slid by 4 per cent to 1,655 pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR absorbed a sharp fall in its big utility Telekom Malaysia as
the KLSE index reversed an early gain to finish 9.09 down at 1,163.15, after
a high of 1,181.30.
Telekom fell 80 cents to MDollars 21.60 while Tenaga dropped 30 cents to
MDollars 14.40.
SHANGHAI and Shenzhen's A shares fell back after their recent rocket-powered
climb, with respective falls of 78.94, or 7.6 per cent, to 962.68 and 16.94,
or 7.3 per cent, to 214.33; but the B shares indices rose by 0.9 and 2.3 per
cent respectively.

FT  08 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa golds overcome early
profit-taking
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold shares shrugged off initial profit-taking in Johannesburg to climb
again as bullion pushed towards Dollars 390 an ounce. Turnover had slowed
from Tuesday's higher levels but sentiment remained positive amid
expectations of further gold price strength in the medium term.
But analysts warned that profits were likely to be taken on any short term
dips in the bullion price after the recent hefty gains, which have seen the
golds index rise by more than 200 points since the start of trade last
Friday.
Golds yesterday climbed 33 to 2,535 and the overall index added 45 at 6,054.
Industrials put on 18 at 6,680, led again by Iscor, which finished 25 cents
higher at a new peak of R4.85.
De Beers was 75 cents firmer at R110.50.

FT  08 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bonds exert varied influence
on bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bond markets had a more varied influence on equities than on Tuesday, writes
Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT's bond and equity markets responded only fleetingly to a newspaper
int-erview of Mr Hans Jurgen Krupp, a Bundesbank council member, who
appeared to be saying that rates could be cut now, allowing Buba room for
manoeuvre when the time comes to raise them again.
The reaction itself was fairly tepid. The Dax index, which had closed the
session down 2.08 at 2,163.82, saw a peak of 2,172.97 in the afternoon but
closed the day at an Ibis-indicated 2,167.68, with bonds on their way down
again. A little after the equity market ended, the September bund future was
back in dangerous territory, below the 90 mark at 89.91 and 15 basis points
lower on the day.
Turnover rose from DM4.9bn to DM5.4bn. In the automotive sector, BMW pleased
analysts with the news that it will introduce extra working shifts and
create additional jobs to meet a high level of demand in the second half of
the year. On the session, the shares rose just DM4.50 to DM815 but they
improved further to DM817.80 after hours.
PARIS moved its bonds up and down, rather more gently than their Frankfurt
counterparts, and equities ended flat after early gains of around a
percentage point. The CAC-40 index finished 2.75 higher at 1,964.20 in
turnover of FFr3.46bn.
Here, some company results had more effect. Promodes, the retailer, rose
FFr12 to FFr936 as it saw an increase exceeding 15 per cent in 1994 net.
Total, the oil company, ended FFr3.70 stronger at FFr307.90 on a higher
first-half net.
Elf Aquitaine went with Total, up FFr4.10 at FFr399, partly on a newspaper
report that it stood to make FFr1.3bn on the divesting of part of its stakes
in the petrochemical engineering companies Technip and Coflexip. Elf had no
comment to make.
ZURICH largely overlooked the weak dollar and bond market, foreign demand
outweighing profit-taking by local investors as the SMI index climbed 10.1
to 2,662.5.
Ciba bearers rose SFr12 to SFr804: Bear Stearns initiated coverage of the
major Swiss pharmaceutical stocks this week with a buy rating on Ciba.
Ascom, the troubled telecommunications group due to release half-year
figures today, fell SFr70 to SFr1,510.
MILAN saw a good performance in domestic bond futures, but its equity market
was depressed by comments from the treasury minister Mr Lamberto Dini that
the country's creaking pensions system faced a higher deficit this year than
earlier expected. The Comit index slipped 4.60 to 658.39 in very quiet
trading.
The mood was also soured by domestic funds lightening their portfolios,
after news of a L78bn net outflow from investment funds during August raised
worries about liquidity.
Generali, a potential beneficiary of pension reform, bucked the downward
trend, picking up L318 to L40,764, after testing support at L40,000.
Among telecommunications issues, Telecom Italia fell L35 to L4,370 and Stet
gave up L80 to L4,750.
MADRID seemed to like a commment from the Spanish economy minister Mr Pedro
Solbes that interest rates were too high compared with Germany's - at a
premium of around 385 basis points - and that it should be possible to
reduce them in the coming months.
The domestic bond market improved and the general index recovered 3.19 to
298.27. Turnover was much healthier at Pta32.5bn, but a big block trade in
Asturiana de Zinc accounted for about a third of that as 7.07m shares, or 23
per cent of its share capital, went through the market at Pta1,500 a share.
AMSTERDAM took its cue from the latest round of company results as the AEX
index firmed 0.89 to 415.17.
Ahold, the retailer, rose Fl 1.30 to Fl 49.70 in heavy turnover after its
better than expected second-quarter figures on Tuesday, and Grolsch, the
brewer, gained 80 cents at Fl 50.80 after a better than expected first half.
Cap Volmac, the computer services group, added Fl 1.20, or 6 per cent, at Fl
21.70 after its upbeat profits forecast.
ISTANBUL fell 6.8 per cent on domestic political worries, the composite
index closing 1,769.48 lower at 24,347.98 after one Turkish deputy resigned,
and another put in a request to do so, bringing the level of vacant seats to
22 - just one below the level at which mandatory by-elections would be
triggered.
Economists and traders worried that any election campaign could force the
ruling coalition to water down its tough stabilisation programme, raising
subsidies and easing economic policies to win votes.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Markets Report: Wary eye on UK rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK markets will open nervously today as traders watch for signs of a
possible rise in UK interest rates, writes Philip Gawith.
Although most observers were not expecting higher rates, a minority thought
yesterday's monthly monetary meeting, between the UK chancellor and the
Governor of the Bank of England, might result in a decision to raise rates
over the next week.
There was no sign in the cash or futures markets that higher rates were
expected, and sterling held steady, with the trade weighted index closing at
78.6 from 78.5.
Elsewhere, the D-Mark maintained its firm tone in Europe, with the Italian
lira slipping back to finish in London at L1,019, from L1,016, on worries
about Italy's fiscal position.
The dollar traded in a narrow range but was helped by comments from a
Bundesbank official suggesting German rates might still fall. It closed at
DM1.5486 from DM1.5426.
The start of trade talks between Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade negotiator,
and Mr Ryutara Hashimoto, the Japanese trade minister, had little effect on
the dollar, which finished at Y98.965 from Y98.695.
Contrary to the views of almost all economists, sterling futures markets
continued to discount a sharp tightening in UK interest rates.
At the beginning of the year, December short sterling reflected three-month
rates at 4.90 per cent. By the close of business yesterday, that had climbed
to 6.45 per cent.
Mr Nick Parsons, treasury economist at CIBC in London, said that revised
expectations about the level of rates have been accompanied by a change in
the slope of the sterling yield curve. In January the September and December
Liffe contracts were both priced at 95-10. This slope (the spread between
the two contract prices) steadily widened to a peak of 91 basis points on
August 23, as worries about rising base rates deepened. Last night the
spread was 84 basis points.
Mr Parsons said he 'could not see rates rising at anything like the pace
that is being discounted'. Even if rates were to rise by as much as 100
basis points, this would not match the current pessimism. Indeed, futures
prices could rise if rates are tightened; that was the recent experience in
both the US and Australia.
Analysts said the reasons for the gloom probably had something to do with
markets being unable to shake off the past. Mr Julian Callow, economist at
Kleinwort Benson, commented: 'The key factor that the short sterling
contract does not yet appear to have accepted is that the 1990s will not
simply be a rerun of the 1980s. By very virtue of the huge explosion of in
household indebtedness that took place then, it is effectively impossible
for a consumer credit-driven boom to recur.'
Markets, however, appear to be taking a 'we will believe it when we see it
attitude'. Another relevant factor is that the market does not appear to
have distinguished between the US recovery and the UK one. The US economy is
growing above its trend rate - not so in the UK - and real rates were close
to zero when the tightening started, compared to UK rates which are about 3
per cent.
It is not only UK futures markets that are pessimistic. In Germany
yesterday, three-month money was trading around 5 per cent, compared to 5.19
per cent being discounted by the December Euromark future. In France,
three-month money at 5.6 per cent falls short of the 6.17 per cent being
discounted by the December PIBOR contract.
Trade in UK futures yesterday was fairly buoyant, with December short
sterling having more than 46,000 lots dealt and settling 10 basis points up
at 93.55. The September contract closed at 94.39 from 94.34.
In the cash markets, three-month sterling LIBOR eased to 5 15/32 from 5 1/2
. The Bank of England provided Pounds 130m late assistance to UK money
markets. Earlier it had supplied Pounds 42m, at established rates, after
forecasting a Pounds 450m shortage. Overnight money traded between 4 5/8 and
6 1/2 per cent.
The dollar received a brief fillip from the comments of Mr Hans-Juergen
Krupp, a Bundesbank council member, who told The European newspaper that he
saw room for rate reductions. These gains were later unwound as Mr Krupp's
reasoning left traders baffled.
Later, Mr Edward Kelley, a US Federal Reserve governor, gave dollar bulls
something more substantial to chew on when he told Reuters that the Fed
could not afford to be lax in achieving its inflationary goals. This helped
the dollar improve to Y99.68 and DM1.5540 in New York before ending at
Y99.45 and DM1.5505.
The issue of a two-tier Europe continued to occupy markets, in the absence
of important data releases. Numerous politicians stepped into the fray, with
German ministers appearing to move back from the idea of a multi-tiered
Europe, and Mr John Major, the British prime minister, singing a similar
tune.
Analysts said renewed talk about criteria had reminded the market that there
were some countries which had public finance problems.

FT  08 SEP 94 / World Commodities Prices: Gold nears Dollars 390 mark -
Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The GOLD price found it impossible to break through the Dollars 390 a troy
ounce barrier on the London bullion market yesterday and the price ended at
Dollars 389.70, up Dollars 2.05. Dealers said Swiss buying started the
present rally and investment funds joined in yesterday on the New York
Commodity Exchange. But producer selling capped the market at about Dollars
390.
'At this level the price looks very attractive to the producers, especially
the Australians,' said one dealer. 'The New York guys seem to be interested
in buying gold on dips to around Dollars 387.50, so it's pretty well
supported,' he added.
ALUMINIUM was lively in after-hours trading in London. Speculative buying
helped run prices above stubborn technical resistance at Dollars 1,570 a
tonne. Last business was at Dollars 1,576.50, up Dollars 15.50, and traders
suggested a move towards Dollars 1,600 was likely.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: British Gas rethinks Dollars
6bn investment in Kazakhstan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas is reconsidering its planned multi-billion dollar investment in
Kazakhstan, according to industry officials. They say the Alma Ata
government is now openly negotiating with Russia for joint development of
its biggest natural gas and oil fields.
British Gas says that negotiations are continuing. But executives have not
hidden their frustration at the slow pace of talks over the past two years,
since Kazakhstan awarded British Gas and Agip of Italy exclusive rights to
negotiate a development agreement for the giant Karachaganak natural gas
field.
The main stumbling block is Russia's refusal to grant clear pipeline rights
to transport Karachaganak gas through its territory. The western partners
had planned to ship an eventual 20bn cubic metres a year to western markets
in a Dollars 6bn project.
Earlier this year, however, BG withdrew much of its heavy equipment from the
site, and industry sources now say the company may withdraw altogether from
the deal.
The latest development follows increasingly heavy economic intervention
across Central Asia and the Caucasus by different official Russian
ministries and agencies. On one hand, Moscow officials have demanded
percentage interests in large western energy deals in the southern ex-Soviet
republics of Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, arguing that Russian engineers
discovered and developed the fields before the 1991 Soviet collapse.
At the same time, government agencies in Moscow have presented obstacles to
the deals by nearly clamping shut Russia's pipeline system.
A week ago, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, held talks
with Kazakhstan prime minister Sergei Tereshchenko on joint development of
both Karachaganak and Kazakhstan's huge Tengiz oilfield, according to
Itar-Tass. Tengiz, to which the US oil company Chevron holds exclusive
development rights, is the former Soviet Union's largest single oil project.
But it too has become bogged down by talks about transit rights across
Russia.
Some analysts believe that Russia is employing economic pressure to boost
the advantages of its own energy industries and to maintain political
sovereignty over former Soviet republics. 'This is Russia asserting its
dominance,' said a senior western diplomat in Tashkent, the Uzbekistan
capital. 'Russia knows that if the oil starts flowing, Kazakhstan will get
its political independence.'
The Uralsk talks marked the first time that a senior Russian official openly
discussed the desire for a piece of the two fields.
Kazakhstan, which holds 50 per cent joint venture partnerships in Tengiz and
Karachaganak, has very little cash, and has been seeking capital.
The Kazakh government says it is now ready to auction off part of its
interest in Tengiz, which has been included on a list of industrial
enterprises to be sold in the near future.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia's US grain imports
likely to reach 7m tonnes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia will import some 7m tonnes of grain from the US this year in spite of
earlier declarations of self sufficiency - a sign that the Russian harvest
will be down on last year's modest levels.
Mr Michael Espy, the US agriculture secretary, said in Moscow yesterday that
the US had cleared the obstacles to export of 400,000 tonnes of wheat to
Russia, and in doing so had opened up the way to further purchases which
Russia wished to make. The two sides had initially disagreed on who should
bear the carriage costs of the wheat consignment - the US has agreed to do
so.
Mr Victor Khlystun, Russia's agriculture minister, speaking after talks with
Mr Espy, said that it would buy between 5m and 7m tonnes of assorted grains
from the US - including corn, soya cakes and feed grains. Russia imported
1.8m tonnes of grain in the first six months of the year - in part because
the US Dollars 700m concessional sales programme announced last year had
been exhausted.
Mr Khlystun said that grain bought and supplied from the US to the Russian
Far East would be cheaper to deliver to these regions than grain bought and
delivered from the European areas of Russia - a sign of the spiralling
transport costs which have depressed coal and other domestic sales.
The official news agency Tass, quoting figures from the Russian agriculture
ministry, said that 47.2m tonnes of grain had been harvested so far - 20m
tonnes down on the harvest at the same time last year. In a separate report,
the Interfax agency said that the ministry forecast a total harvest of
between 90m and 94m tonnes this year compared with last year's total of 99m
tonnes.
Mr Espy said he had told Mr Khlystun that, 'the US stands ready to fulfil
whatever requests they have'. He said he had discussed long- and short-term
credit programmes for grain imports to Russia, and that an agreement on
amounts should be reached.
Mr Khlystun told his US opposite number that Russia was interested in
importing corn, wheat, soybean meal 'and perhaps other commodities like pork
and beef'. The US agriculture department is forecasting Russian demand of
than 8m tonnes of grain.
Deliveries to Russia last year ran at 11.1m tonnes, and 25.5m tonnes in
1992. Reports from the Russian countryside point to a worsening position in
the state and collective farms, as credits to agriculture are cut and sowing
and harvesting are reduced.
At the same time, however, demand is falling. The newspaper Moskovskii
Komsomolets headlined its main report at the weekend 'There is a harvest -
but who will eat it?'. It also said that 'the statistics show that we are
eating less - and not because we are worrying about our figures'.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee gains fail to take hold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coffee prices surged ahead in early trading taking the market close to the
high point reached two months ago after frost damaged the Brazilian crop.
But the market lost all of its earlier gains in late trading.
The November futures contract at the London Commodity Exchange hit Dollars
4,060 a tonne in the first 10 minutes of trading, to slip back again until
the opening of the New York market when it increased its price again.
But a wave of selling sent the contract back to Dollars 3,925 a tonne at the
market's close - Dollars 28 a tonne lower than on Tuesday.
Traders pushed prices higher in the expectation that Brazil will halt its
weekly auctions of government coffee stocks. The Brazilian government was
expected to confirm last night that the auctions would be stopped as they
have failed to dampen domestic coffee prices and curb inflation.
The government had planned to sell 7.7m bags of coffee this year - it has
already sold 2.7m bags.
While sales have stabilised local prices, they have failed to push them down
and Brasilia is now expected to review other ways of reducing domestic
prices.
The stopping of the auctions will be bullish for international coffee
prices, according to Lawrence Eagles, softs analyst at GNI, the London
brokers. 'Consumers will not have the opportunity of rebuilding stock levels
ahead of the expected shortfall in the 1995-1996 crop,' he said.
The tightness in supplies will continue to support market prices.
But a bout of profit-taking by the investment funds pushed the prices down
at the close of the London market yesterday.
'The supply-demand equation continues to be bullish, but the market read too
much into it too quickly and moved ahead too fast,' said Mr Robert
MacArthur, vice president of tropical trading at Merrill Lynch in New York.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US banana exporters file 301
petition
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US banana exporters have filed for action under trade mechanism 301, the
first petition of the Clinton administration. The application calls on the
US trade representative, Mickey Kantor, to target EU trade agreements which
limit Latin America's banana exports and discriminate against US
multinationals.
Chiquita Brands International and Hawaii Banana Industry Association, US
banana marketing companies, allege that EU banana import quotas are damaging
their interests. The petition, filed last week, requests a formal
investigation by the USTR into the Common EU banana policy, signed July
1993, and the Framework Agreement on Bananas, signed between the EU and
Costa Rica, Colombia, Nicaragua and Venezuela, to be implemented on October
1.
Mr Mickey Kantor said yesterday that he expected the issue to come up in
bilateral talks with the UK in the Quadrilateral meeting in Los Angeles this
weekend.
Chiquita claims the Common EU import banana policy discriminates against US
companies in favour of European multinationals in its allocation of
licensing eligibility for banana imports. It also argues that the Framework
Agreement gives the Latin American signatories preferential access to the
European market.
Chiquita's petition comes under 301 procedure which allows US companies to
request a USTR investigation if they believe trade practices are harming US
interests. If the USTR proceeds and fails to find a solution, the US would
consider sanctions. A USTR official said: 'We have consistently opposed the
way the EU is handling its banana regime.'

FT  08 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU harvest in line with reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year's grain harvest in the European Union is expected to be around
160m tonnes, well below the trend prior to the 1992 reforms of the Common
Agricultural Policy, according to Mr Rene Steichen, the EU agriculture
commissioner.
The anticipated fall in the harvest, from about 164m tonnes last year and
185m tonnes in 1991, was a sign the MacSharry reforms were working well, Mr
Steichen said.
'In the cereals sector, there's really no need to go further,' he said.
Mr Steichen was responding to sceptics who argue that EU grain production
will remain too high to satisfy the requirements of the Uruguay Round world
trade agreement. This called for a 21 per cent cut in the volume of
subsidised EU exports by the end of the decade.
The sceptics argue that the European Commission has underestimated the
likely rise in cereal yields and overestimated EU cereal consumption. They
say farmers are likely to face further cuts in price support over and above
the 30 per cent reduction of the MacSharry reforms.
Mr Steichen said changes still needed to be made to unreformed sectors such
as wine, fruit and vegetables and sugar. 'If all that we conclude in the
next months and years works well, I don't think there's a need to change the
CAP,' he said. But he added that further 'minor adjustments' were possible.
Pointing to the success of the reforms to date, he said the EU cereal
mountain had been reduced from 33m tonnes a year ago to 16m tonnes and
intervention stocks of beef had fallen from 1.1m tonnes to less than 250,000
tonnes.
EU consumption of home-grown cereals for animal feed, which the Commission
hoped would have risen by 11m tonnes a year by 1996 as a result of falling
prices, already increased by 5m tonnes last year.
He added that further reforms had been agreed this year to contain beef
production. The Commission fears production could increase again for
cyclical reasons by the end of the decade. The number of special support
payments available to farmers for male beef animals had been cut from 11.5m
to 10.25m.
Mr Steichen said that, contrary to expectations, EU farmers had generally
benefited from the reforms. Indeed he said one flaw in the reforms was that
large cereal farmers received too much in compensation for 'setting aside',
or leaving fallow, 15 per cent of their land.
In the UK, public opinion has been offended by direct payments of hundreds
of thousands of pounds to prosperous landowners in East Anglia and other
intensively farmed arable regions.
Mr Steichen pointed out that the original MacSharry proposals limited the
amount of set-aside land for which farmers received compensation to 7.5ha.
This ceiling had been removed under pressure from Mr John Gummer, the then
UK agriculture minister.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Government Bonds: Bunds remain bearish ahead of GDP data
release
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
German bonds made a half-hearted attempt to stabilise yesterday after six
days of falls but analysts said sentiment remained bearish. Yields on
10-year bunds hovered around 7 1/2 per cent ahead of today's release of
second-quarter GDP data.
The data are expected to show quarter-on-quarter expansion of around 1 per
cent which would bring the yearly growth rate close to 2 per cent. However,
analysts said the quarter-on-quarter data could be misleading initially
because they are rounded up or down to the nearest half-point.
Dealers said a weaker-than-expected result could lift the market but that
any gains would be limited because investors would use the strength to sell
out.
'The bund market still needs to price in a greater risk premium,' said one
bond salesman.
Remarks by Bundesbank central council member Mr Hans-Juergen Krupp that
there was room for a further cut in German interest rates were also viewed
with some scepticism because of his doveish reputation with respect to
inflation.
Latest opinion poll findings which did not give a clear majority to the
government and supply concerns also kept the lid on bund prices. About
DM70bn worth of funding still needs to be done before the end of the year.
The Bundesbank had a better-than-expected reception to its Treuhand auction,
alloting DM4.19bn at an average weighted price at 99.91 and an average yield
of 7.51 per cent. The Bundesbank retained DM2.81bn of the issue for
market-tending operations, bringing the total volume on the issue to DM10bn,
above market estimates of DM8bn.
Gilts were little changed in thin trading yesterday as the market awaited
the outcome of the monthly meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor,
and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England.
'Eddie George will have a tough case persuading the chancellor that rates
should go up now,' said Mr Robert Thomas at Natwest Markets. Mr John
Shepperd at Yamaichi said the consensus was that there would be no change in
interest rates.
The speech in Leiden by Mr John Major, prime minister, addressing the future
of Europe, came too late to affect trading. However, the yield spread
between gilts and bunds widened to 137 basis points, against 132 basis
points on Friday.
A two-speed Europe would be negative for the gilt market because of the
widely-held view that the UK would be relegated to the slow lane along with
Italy and Spain.
On Liffe, the December long gilt future rose  1/2 point to 100 3/8 in late
trading.
Italian bonds were largely unchanged in spite of government moves to cut
spending on pensions. The yield on the 10-year benchmark bond was down 3
basis points to 12.26 per cent. The Spanish benchmark 10-year bond yield was
unchanged at 11.38 per cent.
US Treasuries posted moderate losses yesterday as traders adjusted their
positions ahead of Friday's producer price data.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  3/8 lower at
99 3/16 , with the yield rising to 7.562 per cent. On the short end, the
two-year note was down  1/32 at 100 1/16 , to yield 6.198 per cent.
The morning's economic news was marginally unfavourable, although traders
did not view the data as especially significant. The Commerce Department
announced a 0.4 per cent fall in July wholesale sales and a 0.8 per cent
increase in inventories.
In a more troublesome report, the Labor Department revised downwards its
estimate of the decline in second-quarter non-farm productivity to 2.5 per
cent, the largest drop since the first three months of 1989. It also said
unit labour costs had risen 3.4 per cent last quarter, a red flag for
inflation-sensitive bonds.
The weak tone was more of a reflection of the market's shaky technical
conditions in the run-up to the release of Friday's inflation data.

FT  08 SEP 94 / International Bonds: Dublin likely to tap 10-year eurobond
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ireland is likely to tap the 10-year area of the dollar and French franc
sectors of the eurobond market to meet its 1995 foreign borrowing needs,
which are expected to be about IPounds 4bn, the National Treasury Management
Agency said yesterday.
Mr Adrian Kearns, head of foreign borrowing at the NTMA, said Ireland has
already met its IPounds 800m of foreign borrowing needs for this year.
'It is unlikely that there will be any more issuance this year,' he said,
although Ireland could come to the eurobond market in October or November to
start next year's funding programme.
Cemex, the Mexican cement company, yesterday increased Tuesday's Dollars
250m offering of seven-year eurobonds by a further Dollars 50m. The price
range on the original tranche was a yield spread of 230 to 240 basis points
over underlying US Treasuries.
'Emerging markets have proved to be difficult all year, Mexico in
particular. But this is a fairly strong sign that they are back in
business,' said one syndicate manager.
'This deal could lead to a number of Mexican entities coming to the
(eurobond) market now that the elections are over and things have calmed
down over there,' said another syndicate manager in London.
Syndicate managers said the deal was aggressively priced but that it had
been a success. 'Being a seven-year deal, it is most likely to appeal to US
institutional investors,' a syndicate manager at lead manager Bankers Trust
International said.
Abbey National launched a FFr2bn four-year bond priced to yield 24 basis
points above the 9 1/2 per cent French government bond due 1998.
The offering received significant support from French retail and
institutional investors, joint lead manager Merrill Lynch said, and the
spread of 24 basis points was maintained after the bonds broke syndicate.
The proceeds were swapped back into sterling, Abbey National said.
Depfa Finance launched a Dollars 150m offering of two-year bonds, priced to
yield 15 basis points over the 6 1/4 per cent US Treasury due 1996.
The bonds were sold to retail and institutional investors in Switzerland,
Germany and the Benelux countries, Depfa said. The proceeds were swapped
into floating rate dollar and D-Mark funds, Depfa said.
'There is still good demand from continental European investors for
short-dated dollar paper,' said Frank Ruehland, treasurer at Depfa.

Astra, the fast-growing Swedish pharmaceutical group, yesterday moved to
enhance its profile in the US by obtaining a listing on the over-the-counter
market in New York.
The company said American depository receipts matching its A and B shares
already quoted in Stockholm and London began trading yesterday.
Astra, which last week reported a 23 per cent rise in pre-tax profits in the
first half to SKr4.5bn (Dollars 590m), claims a 17 per cent US market share
for its most successful product, the anti-ulcer drug Losec.
Losec is marketed in the US through a licence agreement with the US group
Merck. Under the terms of a 1982 agreement, the two companies must decide
whether to create a new joint venture by early next year.

Air New Zealand lifted tax-paid profits by 36.6 per cent to NZDollars 190.7m
(USDollars 115.1m) in the year to end-June due to a stronger tourism market,
particularly with visitors from Asia.
The company said yesterday it was confident of further growth during the
coming year with the continuing development of its Asia and Pacific
networks, together with opportunities provided by marketing ofagreements
with Australia. Air New Zealand is using Brisbane as a hub for many of its
services to Asia.
Group operating revenue rose by 11 per cent to NZDollars 2.6bn of which
NZDollars 215m was increased passenger revenue. Group cash flow from
operating revenues rose 64.6 per cent to NZDollars 425m. Total assets were
up by NZDollars 95.4m to NZDollars 2.86bn.
Directors are recommending a final dividend of 8 cents a share, making a
total of 14 cents for the year, up 4 cents on last year.

FT  08 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Ireland to launch gilt
contract to lift market liquidity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Irish Futures and Options Exchange plans to launch a futures contract
based on the 10-year Irish government bond by the end of the year as part of
a series of changes to improve the liquidity of the Irish bond market.
The contract, which will complement an existing 20-year gilt contract, will
be underpinned by a new securities repurchase system which is likely to be
in place by the end of the year.
The reforms are designed to attract more foreign investment, which should in
turn reduce the cost of borrowing to the Irish exchequer.
The Treasury believes the progress towards peace in Ireland will have a
positive impact.
'The IRA ceasefire will have a beneficial impact on the economy and on the
bond market, supporting domestic confidence and attracting foreign
investors,' said Mr John Corrigan, a director of the Irish National Treasury
Management Agency.
Other reforms have included the replacement of the Irish bond market's
order-driven system with a marketmaking operation which is to start next
year. This will involve five to six marketmakers, including two offshore
marketmakers, likely to be two of the pan-European investment houses based
in London.
In early 1995, an independent Irish stock exchange will be created when the
Dublin stock exchange is separated from the International Stock Exchange of
the United Kingdom.
Ireland is hoping to revive its planned eurobond issue denominated in Irish
punts which was cancelled at the end of 1993 because of turbulent bond
market conditions. At the time, the issue was believed to carry a 30-year
maturity.

<TEXT>
Woolworths, Australia's largest food retailer, yesterday announced an
increase in profits which was well above forecast.
After tax and abnormal items, profits increased to ADollars 200.3m
(USDollars 148.3m) in the year to June 27, a rise of 17 per cent on the
previous year's ADollars 171.2m, and comfortably above the ADollars 188.5m
forecast made when the company's shares were floated on the stock market
last year.
The group is not connected with the US company or UK stores of the same
name,
Its sales - up to ADollars 11.5bn from ADollars 10.5bn - also beat the
forecast of ADollars 11.3bn, as did profits before interest and tax of
ADollars 318.9m.
Trading profits in the previous year were ADollars 282.2m, and had been
forecast to rise to ADollars 310.2m. The 1993-94 figures relate to a 52-week
trading period, while the previous year took in 53 weeks.
Woolworths said that same-store sales, adjusting for the extra week, rose by
10.7 per cent, compared with a national retail sales increase of 5.7 per
cent and an inflation rate of 1.7 per cent.
All divisions saw higher profits, with the contribution from the core
supermarkets chain rising by 9.4 per cent, the general merchandise group by
12.2 per cent, and the specialty retail group by 42.9 per cent as the Dick
Smith electronics retail business recovered. During the year, eight new
supermarkets and several new variety outlets were added.
Woolworths said sales since the year-end had been 'particularly strong',
although the health of Australia's retail market generally remained patchy.
Capital expenditure in the current year is likely to edge up to about
ADollars 260m, with an increased share going on the new store programme.

in oil prices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Ampolex, the Sydney-based oil and gas group, yesterday revealed after-tax
profits of ADollars 55.3m (Dollars 40.9m) in the year to end-June, down from
ADollars 80.6m the previous year, writes Nikki Tait.
Profits before tax and abnormals were 1 per cent lower at ADollars 114.7m.
The group said that it had registered record levels of oil and gas
production, but that benefits of this were offset by a 22 per cent decline
in crude oil prices and a significantly higher tax bill.
At Woodside Petroleum, the Australian oil and gas company primarily involved
in development of the North West Shelf gas project, operating profits after
tax more than halved to ADollars 36.4m in the six months to end-June.
The comparable 1992-93 figure of ADollars 72.5m was boosted by an abnormal
gain of ADollars 20.6m.

FT  08 SEP 94 / International Company News: Mitsui abandons merger proposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Mitsui Group, the oldest of Japan's keiretsu, or corporate families, has
called off a proposed merger designed to expand its pharmaceuticals
interests, an area where it feels underweight.
Mitsui Pharmaceuticals, a unit of the group's main chemicals company, Mitsui
Toatsu Chemicals, yesterday abandoned its merger with Toyama Chemical, a
medium-sized pharmaceutical group, because of liabilities inherited by
Toyama from a now defunct affiliate's failed property investments in the
late 1980s.
The three companies cited a court case against Toyama, in which Sanyo
General Capital, a financial institution, is seeking Y5bn (Dollars 51m)
compensation for loans to Yuho Chemical, the former Toyama affiliate.
The collapse of the merger highlights how far corporate Japan still remains
from clearing the damage left by the investment excesses of the so-called
'bubble era' preceding the recession. Toyama has also been a victim of a
growing trend among Japanese companies to take court action to settle
disputes, rather than resolving rows in private.
The merger plan, announced in April 1993, was heralded by the Mitsui Group
as an opportunity to build a pharmaceutical arm to rival those of the
Mitsubishi or Sumitomo keiretsu. Until yesterday, Mitsui appeared ready to
take on Toyama's legal problems, so that it could pursue its pharmaceuticals
strategy.
Japan's pharmaceuticals industry is ripe for mergers and takeovers because
the government is cutting prices on medicines covered by national insurance
in a deliberate attempt to put pressure on companies to restructure.
The pharmaceutical companies announced a delay last October when it emerged
that Toyama was facing legal action over Yuho Chemical, which went bankrupt
four years ago with debts of Y40bn. Like many Japanese industrial companies,
Yuho was tempted to diversify from its main business into property
development during the boom in asset prices in the late 1980s.
The merger partners were hoping by the end of this month to agree fresh
conditions for the accord, originally planned as a share exchange to be
followed by the creation of an equally-owned company controlled by Mitsui
Pharmaceuticals. However, by yesterday they were forced to conclude that a
deal was unworkable.

FT  08 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: The final frontier for
securitisation - Derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US hurricane futures, European flood options and even 'Acts of God bonds'
will be traded by international investors within the next few years,
predicts Mr Richard Sandor, a US financier and a founding father of the
financial derivatives industry.
Mr Sandor, who pioneered interest rate and currency futures and options in
the 1970s and 1980s, says that an embryonic reinsurance derivatives market
is established.
Catastrophe reinsurance futures and options contracts were launched in
December 1992 by the Chicago Board of Trade, which also lists a number of
financial and other derivatives contracts. Trade so far has been limited,
but the volume of transactions has increased by more than 10 times in the
past year or so.
More important, the development of an exchange-traded product appears to be
directly influencing developments in reinsurance, where an over-the-counter
market in catastrophe reinsurance options has emerged.
'It is past its infancy and is really starting to crawl,' says Mr Sandor,
now chief executive and chairman of Centre Financial Products, a New
York-based derivatives boutiques firm, which is one of more than a dozen
firms trading the contracts in Chicago.
Most reinsurers are still highly sceptical about derivatives products. One
chief executive argues that the options currently traded on the exchange are
at least one and half times more expensive than equivalent reinsurance
contracts. Critics say the liquidity in the derivatives market is likely to
remain small and that the indices on which the contracts are based are
inadequate and inferior to the traditional reinsurance products.
However, some reinsurers are more positive. Zurich Insurance, the large
Swiss company, owns a stake in Mr Sandor's company, and others, including
two UK brokers - Sedgwick and Willis Corroon - are also exploring the
potential. There is interest, too, at Lloyd's. Mr Richard Keeling, a leading
underwriter, said: 'It is interesting; we ought to be taking it seriously.'
Underpinning the interest is the conviction that the capital base of the
orthodox insurance and reinsurance industry is increasingly inadequate to
cope with the scale of catastrophic risks, a fact graphically demonstrated
by disasters in the US.
Hurricane Andrew, which tore through Florida in August 1992, was the
costliest US catastrophe with losses of more than Dollars 16bn.
This year's Northridge earthquake, which killed 60 people and damaged 44,000
California homes in January, was the industry's second costliest, with
losses amounting to more than Dollars 7bn.
The severity of the loss was more a reflection of economic growth and
demographic change over the past two decades than the power of the seismic
shock itself. The Northridge earthquake 'would have been a non-event 25
years ago,' according to Mr Sandor.
Mr Andrew Martin, managing director of Sedgwick Payne Insurance Strategy,
says that the capital and surplus of the US property and casualty industry
is estimated at Dollars 183bn, 'but many trillions of assets are insured and
the risks exposed are increasing faster than insurers' capital and
capacity'.
The Chicago Board of Trade contract is based on an index calculated by the
Insurance Services Office (ISO), a US industry body, and on the premiums
received and claims paid by more than 24 US insurance companies.
Futures contracts are priced according to moves in the ISO loss ratio. The
settlement price of each increases by Dollars 250 for each 1 per cent
upwards movement in the ratio. For example, while a loss ratio of 20 per
cent would give each contract a value of Dollars 5,000, a loss ratio of 120
per cent would make the contract worth Dollars 30,000.
Although trade in the futures contract itself has failed to take off,
investors and buyers have begun to trade options - deals giving buyers the
right but not the obligation to buy or sell at a pre-determined price.
Most of the contracts are 'call spreads', used to limit and isolate a
particular layer of risk, explains Mr Morton Lane, managing partner of Lane
Financial, a company which advises brokers trading on the exchange.
Typically, buyers pay for an option to buy a futures contract when the loss
ratio exceeds 50 per cent and sell when the ratio exceeds 70 per cent. The
arrangements in effect give protection in the same way as an excess of loss
reinsurance contract.
Over the past 18 months the CBoT has registered more than 5,000 trades on
one particular contract - covering catastrophe losses on the eastern
seaboard of the US, where there are large storm exposures. Observers also
note a growing trend for reinsurers to use the Chicago contract loss index
as an element of a specialist reinsurance policy, the loss warranty.
Claims on a loss warranty policy are triggered by two sets of losses: those
on the insurance policy of the buyer, and industry-wide claims.
Mr Lane says that the exchange has stimulated changes in the way franchise
covers are underwritten, with the trigger relating to industry-wide losses
becoming more important.
As much as 20 times more business could be traded in 'over the counter
contracts', Mr Lane estimates, with underwriters of these deals frequently
hedging their exposures by buying exchange traded contracts.
Mr Sandor compares the development to the way in which the underwriters of
OTC interest rate swaps hedged their positions by buying eurodollar or US
government bond futures in Chicago in the 1980s, helping to fuel the growth
of that market.
In spite of industry scepticism, enthusiasts stress the attractions of the
new products. For example, while the price of a traditional contract is
generally known only by broker and underwriter, derivative contracts are
transparent. And while reinsurance contracts are negotiated once a year,
derivative contracts are more flexible and can be purchased or traded at any
time.
Mr Martin says the development signals the beginning of the securitisation
of the reinsurance industry, bringing it into line with other financial
services. 'Insurance and reinsurance may be the last frontier,' he says.

FT  08 SEP 94 / International Company News: ConsPress hit by new title
launch costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kerry Packer's Australian Consolidated Press, the magazine publishing
group, yesterday reported an 8.9 per cent fall in profits after tax and
abnormal items in the year to end-June, at ADollars 55m (USDollars 41m).
The result, which compared with ADollars 60.4m in the previous 12 months,
was achieved on sales 2.5 per cent higher, at ADollars 415m. Fully diluted
earnings per share fell to 31.7 cents, from 34.7 cents.
The 1993-94 earnings figure was depressed by a ADollars 9.3m abnormal item,
compared with no abnormals in the previous year. This, according to
ConsPress, related to 'losses incurred on the development of new titles'.
There has been a large number of new launches in the highly competitive
Australian 'mass women's' market recently.
Even at the operating level, before tax and abnormals, profits were lower at
ADollars 91.3m compared with ADollars 98.9m last time - although ConsPress
said the previous year included a one-off gain of ADollars 4.7m due to
accounting-related changes and ADollars 1.5m from a controlled entity,
Offset Alpine, which had since been shed.
It added that existing titles saw revenue grow by about 4 per cent last
year, with circulation revenue rising by 3 per cent and advertising revenue
by 6 per cent. However, profit from these titles fell by 1.5 per cent, as a
result of higher editorial and promotional costs plus the expenses of
establishing its Singapore operation.
The company sounded a more encouraging note about the current year, however,
saying that it had budgeted for an increase in earnings before interest, tax
and abnormals of approximately 10 per cent.
ConsPress added that the merger, already announced, with Nine Network -
another Packer company - was due to take effect on November 8. The merger
depends on shareholder approval.

FT  08 SEP 94 / International Company News: Riding out a hazardous recovery
 -Growth in Brazil is shaking up Autolatina
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Autolatina, holding company for the joint operations of Volkswagen and Ford
in Brazil, should, on the face of it, be humming along. Last year Brazil
became the world's fastest growing big market for cars, due to a combination
of factors including tax cuts and a return to economic growth.
However, Autolatina and its rivals can see hazards looming. The market's
growth, combined with falling tariffs, is forcing domestic manufacturers to
compete against a rising tide of imports.
Furthermore, if the market continues to expand, other world producers may
start up operations in Brazil.
In this changing environment, Autolatina's structure is looking increasingly
out of date.
The original aim of the venture in 1987 was to establish economies of scale
in a stagnating, low-investment industry. VW and Ford pooled resources in
areas such as administration and finances, and made similar-looking vehicles
from the same platforms.
Last week the companies announced an important change in strategy: they will
abandon the joint use of production platforms and switch to the platforms of
their parent companies. They have, however, denied a complete divorce.
Mr Pierre Alain de Smedt, Autolatina chairman, says: 'In 1987 Brazil was a
closed economy, but the market has changed, and moving to world platforms is
a normal evolution.'
Brazil started to open its economy from 1990. Until then, the main
manufacturers - which, apart from Autolatina, included General Motors and
Fiat - had seen sales stagnate at between 800,000 and 900,000 vehicles a
year.
The government cut car import duties from 60 per cent in 1991 to about 35
per cent last year, a move which helped push imports - particularly of
Japanese and German luxury cars - from 15,000 to around 120,000 this year.
Imports are expected to account for 10 per cent of the market this year.
Although the tariff reductions were important, what really made the
difference were agreements between the government, companies and unions to
try to kick-start the market. The measures involved cutting vehicle taxes
and profit margins and controlling wage claims.
Taxes have fallen by 22 per cent on average, helping prices to tumble. This
has been particularly true for 1,000cc cars, known as 'carros populares',
where the tax reductions have been most marked. These now account for half
of all sales, against 10 per cent in 1990. A 1,000cc VW Gol, for example,
costs just over Dollars 7,000 today, compared with Dollars 13,000 three
years ago, says Mr de Smedt.
The result was a 40 per cent production increase last year, to nearly 1.4m
vehicles. This increase made Brazil the 10th-biggest producer worldwide,
ahead of Italy and Mexico, and the figure is expected to approach 1.6m
vehicles this year.
The growth has helped spur productivity gains, which have averaged 17 per
cent a year since 1990. According to a report by consultants Booz-Allen
earlier this year, increases in volume have accounted for more than half the
productivity gains, with the rest due to restructuring.
Quality has also improved, according to Autolatina, which reported car
defects down by 50 per cent since 1990.
However, problems remain. In spite of productivity gains, the gap with
foreign competitors has actually widened since 1990, according to
Booz-Allen. They note that even with labour costs as low as Dollars 8 an
hour, compared with about Dollars 20 in Europe, Brazil's car industry is
still 10 per cent less productive.
Mr Pacifico Paoli, chief executive of Fiat in Brazil, says the advantages of
cheap labour and raw materials in Brazil are offset by an unsatisfactory
transport infrastructure, a poor educational system and economic
considerations such as high interest rates.
Furthermore, although taxes have been cut, they are still much higher than
abroad, says Mr Paoli, who points out that tax accounts for one-third of the
price of a standard saloon car and 17 per cent of a small vehicle.
The tax structure, however, could change under a new sector agreement,
possible by the end of this year, and each company is pushing for a regime
which favours its own production mix.
Fiat's 1,000cc Uno has made it the fastest-growing company. It has increased
capacity and doubled sales of the model in the first half of the year, to
91,000, helping it widen its lead over General Motors.
However, a new agreement could change the tax mix to benefit larger models,
so weakening Fiat's position and improving that of companies such as GM.
While Ford and GM were left behind by the 'carro popular' growth, GM was the
first to respond. Demand for its 1,000cc Corsa has been high, and the
company is trebling production from 3,500 at its March launch to 10,500 by
the end of the year, according to vice-president Mr Jose Carlos Pinheiro. It
also plans to build a plant with capacity of 100,000 vehicles a year.
Ford, whose market share has fallen by half to about 12 per cent in recent
years, intends to produce Fiesta models in Brazil by the second half of next
year, while VW is betting on the continued success of its Gol, which
accounts for more than half its sales.
However, industry experts believe that if the market remains attractive,
international competitors will set up factories in Brazil. Companies such as
Toyota and Nissan, for example, are rumoured to be planning investments.
The reaction of local manufacturers to the threat of imports has been to
call for quotas. The government has refused, and Mr Fernando Henrique
Cardoso, the favourite to win presidential elections this year, has not
supported the claims.
The priority, according to Mr de Smedt, is to continue modernising and
improving productivity. 'We can't relax. We must make the same level of
gains in the next five years to be able to compete internationally.'

FT  08 SEP 94 / International Company News: American Barrick weighs options
for Lac after takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
American Barrick Resources is poised to own 100 per cent of Lac Minerals in
a few weeks and will then focus on the future of Lac's Canadian gold mining
assets and its Latin American properties.
Barrick yesterday had taken up 84 per cent of Lac shares under its cash and
share offer that expired on Tuesday at midnight. The expiry date has been
extended to September 19 to give remaining Lac shareholders time to tender.
By then, Barrick expects to have acquired more than 90 per cent and can then
proceed to acquire the balance.
The offer is either CDollars 5 cash and 0.325 shares of Barrick for each Lac
share, or 0.487 Barrick shares. At Wednesday's price for Barrick shares, the
offer was worth about CDollars 15.56 a Lac share, for a total of CDollars
2.3bn (USDollars 1.7bn).
More Lac shareholders have opted for Barrick shares than expected because of
a firm gold price and the strength of Barrick shares. Barrick is meeting the
cost of the takeover from cash resources.
Mr Peter Munk, Barrick's chairman, will take over as chairman of Lac until
the companies are merged. Mr Robert Smith, Barrick president and chief
operating officer, has been appointed Lac president. Lac chairman Mr James
Pitblado has resigned his post but will remain a director of the merged
company. Lac chief executive Mr Peter Steen will also stay on as a director
of Barrick.
Already north America's fourth largest gold producer, Barrick becomes the
world's third-largest producer, after the Anglo-American group and
Goldfields South Africa.
Barrick's mining team will examine Lac's Canadian properties immediately.
Analysts believe Barrick will probably sell most of them, except a new
British Columbia producer.
Mr Vince Borg, a spokesman for Barrick, said: 'Nothing has yet been decided.
Some smaller and mature Lac properties in Canada may be more valuable to
other companies.
'Barrick is looking at the long-term potential of all the Lac properties,
and our focus is also on the Latin American assets.'
Barrick also sees China as an area with 'tremendous geological
significance', Mr Borg said.

FT  08 SEP 94 / International Company News: Threat to Texaco buy-out bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Texaco, the US energy group, faces a close vote tomorrow in its attempt to
buy out the minority shareholders in its 78 per cent-owned Canadian
subsidiary.
The largest minority shareholder, Canadian 88 Energy, yesterday raised the
value of its own counter offer for the company, Texaco Canada Petroleum. The
independent exploration and production company also reaffirmed it would
reject the Texaco offer.
Mr Greg Noval, president of Canadian 88, said Texaco needed the support of
holders of at least half the remaining 22 per cent before it could mount a
compulsory buy-out of all the shares. On that basis, Canadian 88, which in
the last two weeks has built its stake in Texaco Canada to 9.8 per cent,
requires only a few other shareholders to thwart the US group's plans.
Texaco's offer of CDollars 1.40 a share for the 22 per cent of the Canadian
company it does not already own was countered by a CDollars 1.60-a-share
offer from Canadian 88. Yesterday, the Canadian independent, with market
capitalisation of CDollars 125m (USDollars 91.4m), lifted its offer to
CDollars 1.65 a share, valuing Texaco Canada at CDollars 208m.
Mr Noval said the bid was a genuine attempt to acquire the company, and not
simply a move to force Texaco to increase its own offer.
The dispute centres on the value of Texaco Canada's assets, which include an
interest in a partnership which owns gas assets in British Columbia and
direct ownership of oil reserves in Alberta.

<TEXT>
Chinese Petroleum, Taiwan's state-owned energy company, may take a 5 per
cent interest in Syncrude Canada, the Alberta oil sands producer, for about
CDollars 140m (USDollars 103m).
The seller would be the Alberta government, which would retain a 6.7 per
cent interest.
A Syncrude spokesman said others have shown interest in Syncrude, including
the Koreans.
In Edmonton, Syncrude confirmed that talks were advanced between Chinese
Petroleum and the Alberta government, while in Taipei, the Canadian Trade
Office was reported as saying the deal looked 'prom-ising'.
Syncrude is producing about 175,000 barrels daily and wants to raise this to
217,000 barrels a day. It has potential reserves estimated at 300bn barrels
of oil.
Companies with a stake in Syncrude include Imperial Oil (Exxon) with 25 per
cent, Petro-Canada 12 per cent, PanCanadian Petroleum and Alberta Energy 10
per cent each, Gulf Canada 9 per cent, Canadian Occidental 7.23 per cent,
Murphy Oil, Mitsubishi, and Amoco Canada with 5 per cent each.

FT  08 SEP 94 / International Company News: Fall in prices undermines
Japanese steel producers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's five main steelmakers have revised their forecasts for the first
half of fiscal 1994.
The new forecasts indicate the steel sector as a whole will report greater
losses than in the same period a year ago, and all five will pass their
interim dividends for the second consecutive year.
The companies said a moderate upturn in demand and strenuous cost-cutting
efforts had enabled them to put in a better performance than expected
earlier in the year.
However, the sharp appreciation of the yen and a fall in steel prices
continue to undermine their performance, the companies noted.
They warned further that the yen's rise and low capital investment by
Japanese companies continued to cloud their horizons.
Nippon Steel said it expected sales of Y980bn (Dollars 9.9bn), 10 per cent
below the result last year. The company forecasts a pre-tax loss of Y30bn,
nearly double the Y16.7bn loss it recorded in the first half of last year,
on sales of Y1,060bn, but an improvement on the Y40bn it forecast earlier in
the year. No sales forecast was made then.
Kobe Steel expects sales of Y530bn and a pre-tax loss of Y10bn, compared
with first-half sales of Y545bn and a pre-tax loss of Y8.1bn last year. It
had earlier forecast sales in the first half of Y520bn to Y530bn and a
pre-tax loss of Y20bn.
NKK expects sales to total Y520bn and its pre-tax loss to be Y40bn, against
last year's sales of Y537bn and a loss of Y1.9bn. NKK has not previously
forecast its first-half results.
Meanwhile, Kawasaki Steel anticipates sales in the first half of Y450bn and
a pre-tax loss of Y19bn. This compares with sales of Y522bn and a pre-tax
loss of Y8.3bn in the first half of 1993 and an earlier forecast of Y450bn
in sales and a Y20bn pre-tax loss.
Sumitomo Metal is forecasting sales of Y490bn and a pre-tax loss of Y24bn
compared with sales of Y508bn and a Y9bn loss in the same period last year.
This is the first forecast for the period from the company.

Lehman Brothers, which started paring jobs even before it was spun off from
American Express earlier this year, is trimming another 300 positions, a
Wall Street source said, Reuter reports from New York.
Analysts think it is likely the cuts at Lehman will be followed by
redundancies at other large Wall Street firms if business does not pick up
soon.
A Lehman official said employment totalled 9,300 at the beginning of 1994,
and fell to 8,950 by the end of June. It was at a peak of 9,400 in 1993.
The source said the new cuts were 'across the board', affecting everyone
from managing directors down, and were due to worsening conditions in the
securities industry.
They affect only US operations and not employment abroad, where market
conditions are in 'growth stages', the source said.
Mr Perrin Long, analyst at First of Michigan Corp, noted that New York Stock
Exchange member firms reported losses totalling Dollars 404m after tax in
the second quarter of 1994, compared with a Dollars 1.5bn profit a year ago.
It was the largest quarterly deficit for the industry since a Dollars 1.7bn
loss after tax in the fourth quarter of 1987.

PT Freeport Indonesia, the Indonesian mining unit of Freeport-McMoRan Copper
&amp; Gold of the US, has sold a group of its non-mining assets for about
Dollars 77m, AP-DJ reports from New Orleans. The deal is one of a series of
completed and planned asset sales.
Freeport-McMoRan said the unit sold the assets to its Indonesian joint
venture with ALatieF Nusakarya of Jakarta, Indonesia. ALatieF Nusakarya owns
two-thirds of the joint venture, while PT Freeport owns the rest.
Freeport-McMoRan said the assets were primarily multi-family residential
properties and a hotel complex.
PT Freeport will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including
capital requirements for its mine-mill expansion, which it expects to
complete during the second half of 1995.
The 84-room hotel complex will be managed under an agreement with ITT
Sheraton, a unit of ITT of the US.

<TEXT>
Goodman Fielder, the troubled Australian food group, yesterday bowed to the
demands of dissident shareholders and agreed to appoint three of their
nominees to its board, so avoiding a proxy battle next month.
Goodman said Mr Jon Peterson, a former chairman of Unilever Australasia, Mr
Neil Lister, a director of Melbourne-based Agrifoods, and Mr Ken Neilsen,
formerly an executive with Mars Australia, had been invited to join the
board at its October 6 meeting. Mr Terry Arcus, a former McKinsey director,
and Mr John Landerer, a solicitor, two non-executive directors of Goodman,
will stand down at the same time.
Mr Peterson will become deputy chairman. In addition, the group's current
chairman, Mr John Studdy, said the board would search for a new independent
chairman. He will retire when a successor has been found.
As a result of the deal, the extraordinary meeting, requisitioned by the
unhappy investors, will now be cancelled. Shareholders will get their chance
to approve the new board appointments at the AGM in November.
Yesterday's agreement follows a push for board changes by Mr Doug Shears, a
Melbourne-based businessman whose Agrifoods group has a small shareholding
in Goodman, and three large institutional shareholders - the Australian
Mutual Provident, Bankers Trust Australia, and State Superannuation
Investment and Management Corporation. They have been distressed by
Goodman's static profits and sagging share price.

FT  08 SEP 94 / International Company News: Italian banks face tight
timetable - San Paolo and BNC seem to be moving towards deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It should have been a simple marriage of convenience: undercapitalised bank
meets wealthy suitor, they merge and live happily ever after.
That was the draft script for a deal signed in March by Italy's Banca
Nazionale delle Communicazioni, a small bank with just over 60 branches,
controlled by the Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), the state railway, and Istituto
Bancario San Paolo di Torino, the country's biggest bank with nearly 1,000
outlets nationwide.
The preliminary accord gave little away, but at the time it was said that
the two banks would swap shares, leaving BNC with a 6 per cent or 7 per cent
stake in San Paolo. It looked like the end of a long search by BNC for a
strategic partner which could end losses, and restructure management.
The companies wanted to formalise their union quickly to take advantage of
fiscal incentives for banking takeovers which were introduced in 1990 but
are only available up to the end of this year.
Six months later, San Paolo is still the only bank to have declared a formal
interest in BNC. But in the meantime, a modest merger has been turned into a
highly charged political issue, the catalyst for rumours about phantom
counter-bids, tension within the new Italian government, and a series of
attacks on the Italian central bank.
Mr Publio Fiori, Italy's transport minister since May, has deliberately put
himself at the centre of the controversy.
It was Mr Fiori who, at the end of June, sought clarification from the FS
about the terms of the merger with San Paolo and then began single-handedly
to campaign for a better deal.
Apart from the bank's foundation, which holds about 44 per cent of the
shares, and the FS which controls just over 50 per cent, about 7 per cent of
BNC belongs to 80,000 small shareholders, mainly railway workers.
Mr Fiori has argued that the strategic importance of the bank is such that
it should not be abandoned for a handful of San Paolo paper in a deal
hastily struck by an outgoing government.
With about L50,000bn (Dollars 31.2bn) of railway investment to be carried
out over the next few years, the transport minister says the FS needs to be
able to count on dedicated financing.
Since August, with most of the rest of the government on holiday, Mr Fiori
has increased the intensity of his campaign, lambasting the Bank of Italy -
which must approve banking mergers - for allegedly trying to force BNC into
the arms of San Paolo without considering possible counter-bids.
Fellow members of the right-wing National Alliance attacked the Bank of
Italy, accusing Mr Antonio Fazio, the governor, of abusing his position, and
asking the Rome prosecutor to open a file on the case. However, the promised
counter-bids have failed to materialise.
Cassa di Risparmio in Bologna, a small retail bank, did make a tentative and
informal cash offer, which was dismissed by the Bank of Italy as inferior to
the San Paolo bid.
Indeed, until this week, it seemed as though Mr Fiori's intervention had
achieved little except many column inches of publicity for the minister and
deep irritation at the central bank and the Treasury.
In the meantime, the timetable for doing a deal has grown tighter and
tighter.
Analysts suggest that if a merger cannot be agreed by the end of this month
there will not be enough time to complete the formalities by the end of the
year, and take advantage of the promised tax-breaks.
However, in the last few days the fog surrounding the BNC case has begun to
lift.
On Tuesday evening, Mr Fiori indicated his confidence that Mr Lamberto Dini,
the Treasury minister, would decide the outcome of the affair.
San Paolo has now amended its own bid, sources say. The cash which Mr Fiori
wants for BNC is unlikely to be forthcoming, but the Turin-based bank has
proposed a more complex share-swap which would strengthen links between BNC
and Crediop, a San Paolo subsidiary specialising in the financing of public
investment projects.
Although the new deal is said to be worth more than the original all-paper
offer, it may not satisfy Mr Fiori.
Last night, Italian news agencies reported that the transport ministry had
received a new alternative offer for BNC.
The BNC affair may not yet have reached the end of the line.

The recovery in French retailing was highlighted yesterday when Promodes,
one of the country's leading distribution groups, said net profits rose 15
per cent in the first half of 1994.
Promodes, which has large interests in Spain as well as in France, saw net
profits rise to FFr264m (Dollars 47.1m) in the first half of the year from
FFr229m during the same period of 1993.
The group achieved a 3 per cent increase in sales to FFr44.2bn from
FFr42.8bn between the two first halves.
The French retail sector is emerging from a difficult period in which
consumer spending was depressed by the recession.
However, the economic climate is improving, consumer confidence is slowly
starting to rise and the pressure on the retailers is easing.
Promodes said its first-half performance would have been better without the
devaluation of the Spanish peseta.
It estimated that, on a constant exchange rate basis, its sales would have
risen by 5.9 per cent during the first six months of the year.
Promodes operating profits rose 11 per cent in the interim period to FFr814m
from FFr733m.
The company said that it had benefited from improved financial controls and
a reduction in exceptional items.
M6, the French television station, yesterday confirmed that it plans to go
public with a stock market flotation on September 28.
The company, now the third force in French television with annualised sales
of FFr1.5bn, also intends to launch a new themed TV channel, according to Mr
Jean Durkcer, chairman.

<TEXT>
Grolsch, the Dutch brewer, posted a rise of nearly 20 per cent in first-half
net profit and said full-year results would increase at roughly the same
rate.
Net profit rose to Fl 17.0m (Dollars 9.7m) from Fl 14.2m in the first half
of 1993, with profit per share up 18.3 per cent at Fl 1.10. Turnover was 33
per cent lower at Fl 391.8m. Grolsch said the figures were not directly
comparable because the company sold Wickuler, its German beer group, to Brau
und Brunnen of Germany in January.
Operating profit rose by 17.3 per cent to Fl 28.8m, while interest charges
fell to Fl 0.4m from Fl 3.3m.
Sales in the Netherlands, Grolsch's largest market, fell slightly because of
poor spring weather. But it said this was more than offset by lower raw
material prices and lower operating and packaging costs.
In the UK, where Grolsch owns the Ruddles brewery, a new marketing campaign
led to higher sales of Ruddles beer, particularly in the second quarter.
Grolsch said its personnel costs fell in the first half, reflecting a
reorganisation at Ruddles, rationalisation in the Netherlands and the
elimination of the group's UK sales office.
This year, Grolsch entered into a UK distribution joint venture with Bass,
the largest brewer in the UK.

FT  08 SEP 94 / International Company News: Canadian provinces face
downgrade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Canadian provinces face further downgrades to their credit ratings,
according to Dominion Bond Rating Service (DBRS), one of Canada's two bond
rating agencies.
Accumulated government deficits are so large that normal improvements
stemming from economic recovery are likely to prove ineffective, the rating
service says in a report sent to provincial officials.
Last month the Toronto Dominion Bank predicted that Canadian federal and
provincial deficits would reach a worst ever CDollars 780bn (USDollars
570bn) by next March.
DBRS said corporate and personal taxes are so high that it would be
difficult to get more revenue from traditional sources, both at the federal
and provincial levels.
While some provinces have checked rising health costs, British Columbia and
Quebec are said by DBRS to be understating their fiscal 1995 deficit by
CDollars 1bn each. However, Ontario's budget deficits are the highest.
The federal government's interest bill has doubled since 1985 and the
average maturity of its debt has dropped to 4.3 years. This makes it more
vulnerable to higher interest rates, DBRS warns.

in first six months

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Total, the French oil and chemicals group, yesterday announced almost
unchanged first-half net profits of FFr1.98bn (Dollars 356m), in spite of
weak crude prices and refining margins, compared with FFr1.93bn a year ago.
Mr Serge Tchuruk, president, said that given the volatility of petroleum and
currency markets, he could not forecast how full-year results might compare
with last year's FFr3.1bn profit.
However, he claimed increasing financial strength for the group, which in
the first half improved its cash flow by 4 per cent to FFr6.1bn.
Net investment was cut by FFr1bn to FFr4.6bn and net debt-to-equity gearing
ratio reduced to 20 per cent, compared with 23 per cent at end-December.
Turnover rose slightly to FFr68.7bn in the half year because increased sales
volume was offset by lower prices. The main sectoral improvement was in
chemicals, where operating profits rose 16 per cent on the back of higher
demand from the European car and packaging industries.
Mr Tchuruk said Total had not only showed a better return on capital over
the past four years than rival oil groups, but that the French company was
replacing oil reserves at a higher rate and at a lower cost than others.
Total's goal is to produce 1m barrels a day by the end of the century, or
more than it will be refining, as a correction to its previous
over-dependence on downstream activities.
Its main prospecting areas for oil are in the Middle East, where Mr Tchuruk
confirmed that Total 'like every other company' was talking to Iraq but
would do nothing until United Nations sanctions were lifted. In chemicals,
gas production and oil refining, Total was investing in Asia.
Mr Tchuruk said that although Elf-Aquitaine had been privatised, there had
been 'relatively little restructuring' in the European oil industry, partly
because much of it was in state hands.
He added that 'there are too many actors and a great many needs for
restructuring in the European market,' which he forecast would remain
difficult.
In terms of financial acquisitions and industrial accords, 'we are open to
opportunities', he said.

FT  08 SEP 94 / People: Allan leaves BET for Ocean
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Allan, BET's group marketing director who has been on the board for the
past seven years, has been appointed chief executive of Ocean Group, the
freight, environmental and marine services company.
Allan, 46, whose appointment is seen as a significant coup for Ocean, will
take up his new post at the end of this month. His move ends the uncertainty
over the succession to Nicholas Barber, chief executive for eight years, who
left Ocean last month.
Allan has wide experience of the international industrial service sector
through more than 20 years at four blue-chip companies. He also has specific
knowledge of some of Ocean's business areas; for example, at BET he has been
chairman of Biffa, the waste management company and has built a solid track
record for achieving profitable growth across a range of businesses and
markets.
Ian Laurie, Ocean's finance director, acknowledged yesterday that although
Ocean has successfully cut costs, its financial performance remained
inadequate: 'We need to focus on growth,' he said.
After graduating in mathematics from Edinburgh University in 1970, Allan
began his career as a marketing trainee with Lever Brothers, becoming brand
manager for Lux soap and subsequently Comfort fabric conditioner.
He left Lever Brothers to join Bristol-Myers' consumer products division and
in 1977 joined Fine Fare where he was promoted to marketing and buying
director in 1983.
In 1985 Allan joined BET and became one of three directors on the main board
with specific responsibilities as sector director of business services
(Europe) and as group marketing director.
Allan is also a non-executive director of Connell, a member of the CBI
market strategy group and a council member of the Institute of Directors. He
is also a former chairman of the Marketing Society of Great Britain.

FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Aiming to succeed where others have failed
 -MSU's CD systems look set to find their way into homes world-wide / Growth
from Technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE

<TEXT>
The name on the box in the living room may be that of a well known Asian or
American manufacturer, but the electronics inside will be British. That, at
least, is the hope of MSU, a young UK company with big ambitions in the
electronic home entertainment business.
Ostensibly, the odds are against it. Japanese companies dominate the
world-wide consumer electronics industry while US companies are making the
running in multimedia - essentially interactive television - which many
believe is the future of home entertainment.
Yet MSU, working from a set of overcrowded offices in Milton Keynes, has
secured contracts for its technology from big companies in Hong Kong,
Singapore, Taiwan and the US. Confidentiality clauses prevent identification
of the companies concerned, but if MSU has read the market right, it can
expect to see its systems gracing homes from Taipei to Tallahassee.
It claims that its current contracts will ensure that more than 1m products
with MSU technology will be sold next year. 'Current negotiations with other
companies means it could be more than 3m units,' it says.
MSU's expertise lies in compact disc technology. Not just audio CD, now
found in almost half all US households, but a range of variations which
together define a new generation of CD players. These include video CD,
Photo CD, CD plus G (video CD with text and graphics superimposed) and
karaoke CD. (Do not be sniffy about karaoke CD; the market in east Asia for
these systems is huge and lucrative.)
MSU designs the semiconductor chips, the electronic circuitry, and the
software which make it possible to integrate all these functions into a
single unit which plugs into the domestic television and hi-fi.
So the customer will be able hear music, watch a movie, sing along with his
or her favourite band and look at holiday snaps using the same machine. The
system has also, of course, great potential for business presentations.
Critically important from a marketing point of view, MSU's new generation CD
machines will not cost appreciably more than existing audio CD machines.
Mr Keith Hall, MSU managing director, believes other sophisticated CD
systems have failed because they have been seen as an expensive addition to
existing equipment rather than a replacement or upgrade for it: 'Millions of
people will be planning to buy audio CD machines over the next few years,
and many will be happy to pay an extra Pounds 100 for video CD.'
The secret of MSU's technology is a set of specially designed semiconductor
chips and software which take the heavily compressed information on the disc
and expand it so it can be displayed on a television screen. MSU's chips are
both powerful and cheaper than competitive products. It accepts it is not
immune to competition, but it is already developing the next generation of
chips to stay ahead.
MSU will not manufacture CD players, however. It lacks the capital. Its
strategy is to provide a turnkey service for other equipment manufacturers,
providing them with a custom-built electronics package ready to be
incorporated in a casing of their own design. MSU calls this 'generic CD'.
MSU's chairman, Mr Wyn Holloway, is an old hand at undercutting the
competition in electronics. Formerly a carpenter, he was named Welsh
Businessman of the Year after setting up a company making low-cost computer
game joysticks.
Computer games culture permeates MSU. Mr Hall played a big part in launching
the Commodore Pet and Apple Macintosh pcs in the UK. Head of research and
development is Mr Martin Brennan, formerly chief engineer with Sir Clive
Sinclair's Sinclair Research. The software engineers are for the most part
ex-games authors: 'They are good at getting a lot of performance out of
little computing power. We give them a lot of computing power,' Mr Hall
says.
Mr Holloway and Mr Hall formed the company in 1992. Its first contract, with
the Chinese government, was for a low-cost games machine for the Chinese
market. The following year the company contracted with TXC of Taiwan for the
design of a games machine.
These deals provided the seed capital, some Pounds 2m, for current
developments. Last year turnover was Pounds 2m and losses amounted to Pounds
500,000. This year, turnover will amount to Pounds 12m and the company
should make Pounds 3m in pre-tax profits.
With development contracts in place, including a project for a large US
computer maker, MSU does not see an immediate need for new investment, but
Mr Hall admits that an extra Pounds 250,000 to Pounds 500,000 would enable
the company to pursue extra lines of development.
Going public is an option, and MSU is in discussions with stockbrokers. Mr
Holloway says no decision has been taken; but if the company decided to go
for a quote, the formalities could be undertaken quickly.

Lord Owen, co-chairman of the Steering Committee of the International
Conference on the former Yugoslavia, has accepted his first non-executive
directorship by joining the board of Coats Viyella, Britain's largest
clothing and textiles company.
The former foreign secretary has told the Geneva-based committee he would
take a pay cut, which would be off-set by the Pounds 15,000-Pounds 20,000
package he is expected to receive from Coats.
A Coats spokesman explains that Lord Owen had been an acquaintance of a
number of directors for some time and that his 'experience and understanding
of international affairs will bring new and valuable insights to the
company'.
Although his role at the textiles group will be secondary to that in the
former Yugoslavia, the company says he will attend the board meeting in
London next month.
Lord Owen says that for some time he has wanted 'to gain more experience of
international business and now that the hectic pace of the negotiations has
eased off, I have the time to pursue other activities'.

FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Nordic decline hits Intrum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Continuing problems in Sweden and Finland led to a 6.6 per cent fall in
profits at Intrum Justitia, Europe's largest debt collection group, in the
six months to June 30.
Pre-tax profits slipped to Pounds 7.01m (Pounds 7.47m) while operating
profits fell more sharply to Pounds 6.78m, including Pounds 300,000 from
acquisitions, against Pounds 7.83m. Turnover edged ahead from Pounds 41.7m
to Pounds 42.3m, including Pounds 1.39m from acquisitions.
Mr Bo Goranson, the chairman and holder of 30.9 per cent of the shares,
admitted that the depth and length of the decline in the Nordic markets had
been unforeseen.
He cautioned that the cost saving programme would not benefit the group
immediately, but in years to come. 'We have not reached the bottom yet.'
Operating profits from the region fell from Pounds 6.2m to Pounds 3.9m.
By contrast, German-speaking countries (particularly Switzerland) saw growth
to Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 100,000), while the UK, France and the Netherlands
chipped in Pounds 3m (Pounds 2.6m).
In the UK, the group launched the Pounds 500,000 business-to-business
collection operation and already has some 1,600 clients, 4 1/2 times more
than the group had expected at this stage.
Over the past three years the group has spent Pounds 3m sponsoring a boat in
the Whitbread Round The World Race, from which it accrued mentions in 10,000
articles, in 80 hours of radio and 90 of TV. It reckons equivalent
advertising would have cost Pounds 28m.
It hopes to capitalise, especially in the UK and southern Europe, on
expected EU legislation on late payment, which it expects will be compulsory
in about two years' time.
Earnings declined to 4.5p (5.2p) per share, but the gross dividend is held
at 1.1p.

The turnover of top staff at Lazard Investors continued yesterday with the
announcement of the departure of Jimmy West as chief executive.
West was said to have felt that he had completed his task; it is understood
that the separation was mutually agreed and his next move has not been made
public.
This move follows a succession of changes at Lazard Investors - which the
parent company now hopes will cease. 'It is a world in which there are a lot
of changes,' says David Verey, chairman of Lazard Brothers. 'We've had more
changes than frankly I would wish. But that's life.'
Tom Cross Brown, a director in corporate finance, takes over from West. Says
Verey: 'We are an international house and Tom is very much an
internationalist'; he was head of Lazard Brothers' Hong Kong office from
1982 to 1986.

Kleinwort Benson Securities is clearly expecting the UK market to build up a
head of steam and has moved quickly to bolster its highly-rated team of
marketmakers, recruiting three of the UK market's senior traders. Peter
Angeli, 28, joins KB from Lehman Brothers and previously spent four years
marketmaking at Smith New Court. Hugh McAlister, 33, and Wayne Grossman, 37,
move over from UBS where both were directors.
McAlister spent five years at UBS, and was previously at the then County
NatWest. Grossman has been one of UBS's front-line marketmakers since 1986.
KB had a couple of bad experiences in the market in the late 1980s but has
gradually rebuilt its confidence in the securities trading arena.
It scored a big hit recently in recruiting top economist Ian Harwood from SG
Warburg and says it is still keen to expand on all fronts in the securities
business.

FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Hilton and Ewart combine to build 5-star
Belfast hotel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Northern Ireland economy was given a boost yesterday with the
announcement of a Pounds 17m development to build a Hilton Hotel in Belfast.
Hilton International, the hotel subsidiary of Ladbroke Group, has set up a
joint venture with Ewart, the Belfast-based property developer, to develop
the hotel.
Mr Paul McWilliams, chairman of Ewart, said they had been in talks on the
development for many months. 'Everybody is now taking credit for having
great foresight.'
He added that following the IRA ceasefire the move was a tremendous boost
for the province. 'We are all hopeful that it will be the start of a better
future.'
The building of the hotel, the first five star in Northern Ireland, is being
financed by Pounds 6m of share capital, 60 per cent from Hilton, with the
balance provided by grants and short term loans.
The hotel is being built in the Ewart's Laganbank development, valued at
about Pounds 100m. The company is about to announce a 450,000 sq ft office
block which will almost complete the development.
Ewart's shares rose 1p to 70p.

24.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Interim pre-tax profits at Birmingham Midshires Building Society advanced by
38 per cent to Pounds 24.7m following a rise in income and a fall in
provisions for bad and doubtful debts.
While highlighting Birmingham Midshires' aim of acquiring other societies,
Mr Mike Jackson, chief executive, admitted there was little immediate
pressure on smaller societies to agree to be taken over.
Net interest income rose to Pounds 46m (Pounds 43.7m), despite a narrowing
of interest margins, as the society competed aggressively for retail
savings.
Sales of life insurance policies largely accounted for the rise in
non-interest income to Pounds 12.3m (Pounds 10.3m).
Mr Jackson said expenses had risen to Pounds 30m (Pounds 27.2m), and that
the cost/income ratio had also increased, to 51.5 per cent compared with
50.4 per cent in the first half of last year. The society was investing in a
new headquarters and in upgrading its computer systems.

<TEXT>
British Biotechnology, one the UK's largest biotechnology companies,
yesterday claimed it had made a breakthrough in developing a drug to treat
acute pancreatitis, a condition with no effective cure at present, writes
Tim Burt.
Shares in the group rose 6p to 461p after the group said preliminary tests
showed the drug - lexipafant - was an effective remedy and, if fully
developed, could exploit a market worth an estimated Pounds 300m a year.
'Given the high margins in this business, it could turn the company round,'
said Mr James Noble, finance director.
The group is about to embark on Phase Three clinical trials of the drug and
expects to seek regulatory approval to market it before the end of 1996. It
is also on course in developing a new anti-cancer drug - Batimastat - which
could be the world's first oral treatment for cancer sufferers
Shares in Anagen climbed 17p to 65p yesterday after the biotechnology
company received clearance from the US Food and Drug administration to
market Auraflex, its automated immunoassay system.
The system can be used to measure the presence of infectious diseases,
monitor cancers and make fertility assessments.

FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Wellcome anti-migraine drug threat for
Glaxo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wellcome, the UK drugs group, has thrown down a challenge to its rival,
Glaxo, by reporting successful tests of a new anti-migraine drug.
The development of the drug - codenamed 311C-90 - could threaten the market
dominance of Imigran, one of Glaxo's fastest-growing products which had
sales of Pounds 116m last year.
Although Wellcome is not expected to seek regulatory approval for the new
drug for at least two years, it said it had the potential for 'previously
unachieved levels of safety and efficacy'.
City analysts said the market for such a drug was worth at least Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 600m) and could, in time, exceed the market for anti-asthma
treatments - currently worth some Dollars 4bn.
'Glaxo should be concerned about this development. It is the first real
threat to Imigran,' said one analyst.
The challenge coincided with news that Glaxo had alerted US physicians about
possible drug-associated deaths linked to Imitrex, the name used for Imigran
in North America.
The manufacturer, however, said the vast majority of Imitrex users had not
suffered any side effects, and the few fatalities were linked to exceptional
circumstances where the patients been given the drug despite a history of
cardiovascular diseases and other risk factors such as asthma.
Wellcome, meanwhile, said its drug had shown no effects on blood pressure or
cardiovascular problems during clinical trials.
Those trials showed that 62 per cent of patients suffering migraine found a
'striking reduction' in pain within two hours.
Glaxo said its tablet form of Imigran showed a 50 per cent success rate over
the same period, although it showed an 80 per cent improvement in its
injected form.
Analysts predict sales of Imigran could exceed Dollars 480m in the 12 months
to July this year, even though the drug has not yet become widely available
in tablet form.
Wellcome shares, which fell 14p to 685p earlier this amid concern at
possible sedative side-effects of the drug, closed up 1p at 686p.
Glaxo, which is expected to report full year profits of between Pounds
1.88bn and Pounds 1.9bn today, recovered to 622p, after closing down 13 1/2
p at 620p on Tuesday on news of Wellcome's drug development.

FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Simon reduces loss to Pounds 12.4m -
Recovery trend as debt position shows significant improvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Simon Engineering yesterday reported a sharply reduced first-half loss of
Pounds 12.4m and a much-improved debt position, but as expected is paying no
interim dividend.
The pre-tax loss compares with a deficit of Pounds 52.6m in the first half
of 1993 and Pounds 160.3m for the full year. The interim loss per share was
reduced from 51.8p to 12p.
Mr Michael Davies, chairman, said the result reflected the progress made
towards restoring Simon as a 'sound and profitable' engineering group.
The group is being restructured to concentrate on three core businesses: the
access division, the storage division and Simon-Carves, the process
engineering contractor.
Mr Davies said the new management team, headed by chief executive Mr Maurice
Dixson, had vigorously maintained its focus on debt and trading. 'We have
reiterated the message today that we are sorting out the company in 1994 and
will deliver the results in 1995,' said Mr Dixson.
Proceeds from May's Pounds 52.5m rights issue, along with receipts from
business and property divestments, had cut borrowings from Pounds 117.8m at
the end of 1993 to Pounds 72.1m on June 30, reducing gearing from 264 per
cent to 85 per cent.
Asset disposals since last September had raised Pounds 36m and more property
disposals were expected to be completed in the second half, further reducing
borrowings.
Stringent financial controls were imposed last year but it was taking longer
than expected to reduce working capital, especially at Simon Access, where
some US business taken on at low margins was being unwound.
The group's first-half turnover dropped from Pounds 190.8m to Pounds 154m
and the trading loss of Pounds 8.4m was down sharply from the previous
Pounds 23.4m loss. Continuing businesses accounted for only Pounds 655,000
of the loss, apart from Pounds 3.75m of exceptional restructuring costs.
The largest division, Simon Access, had a trading loss of Pounds 3.66m
(Pounds 1.59m profit), as turnover slipped to Pounds 71.6m (Pounds 79.2m).
There were trading losses in the UK but the recent reorganisation was
expected to result in a much reduced cost base.
Simon-Carves lifted turnover from Pounds 21.6m to Pounds 23.3m and cut its
trading loss from Pounds 546,000 to Pounds 193,000. Simon Storage, in
contrast, raised trading profits from Pounds 4.35m to Pounds 4.58m on
turnover of Pounds 22.8m (Pounds 20.6m).
Mr Davies said the operating profits achieved in the past three months
provided a clear indication that the trading performance had turned the
corner. All the businesses were reporting increased inquiries and order
books were looking better.
Mr Dixson said there was no reason to change the view expressed at the time
of the rights issue that dividends would resume next year.

FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Lazard launches brewery trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Beer drinkers will have the chance to recoup some of their costs when Lazard
Investors launch a new investment trust later this month.
Lazard Brewers Investment Trust will deal principally in quoted UK regional
brewers, such as Greene King and Young, and pub companies and other
companies in the drinks trade.
Mr Martin Hawks, analyst with Greig Middleton, broker to the issue, said
yesterday that the outlook for regional brewers was better than it had been
for some time.
The sector was characterised by sound balance sheets, strong cashflows and
good dividend cover.
The trust will be managed by Mr Billy Whitbread, for the past five years
investment manager of Whitbread Investment.
The trust, to be launched on September 29 with subscriptions closing in the
third week of October, will have an initial yield of 3 per cent and an
initial 10-year life.

Pre-tax profits at Home Counties Newspaper Holdings leapt from Pounds
155,000 to Pounds 976,000 in the six months to June 30. Turnover was up
slightly from Pounds 12.1m to Pounds 13.2m.
The result was helped by an exceptional gain from the sale of the share in
Mid Anglia Radio to GWR for Pounds 316,000.
The interim dividend is 2.5p (2p). Earnings per share were 6.54p (1.24p).

The maiden interim dividend is 1.2p. Earnings per share were 6.18p (3.87p),

Wills Group, the engineering products group, reported pre-tax profits almost

The advance was achieved on turnover up from Pounds 19.3m to Pounds 31.5m -

interest charge from Pounds 45,000 to Pounds 166,000.
The directors said that as a result of acquisitions made in the last few
months of the financial year, the accounts did not reflect the current size

considerably higher.
Earnings came out at 1.85p (1.6p), or 1.79p (1.28p) fully diluted. A
proposed final dividend of 0.385p (0.3p) raises the total for the year to
0.5p (0.4p).

FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Nurdin puts expansion plans on back burner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nurdin &amp; Peacock, the cash and carry group, has put plans to expand its
warehouse clubs on hold until the government's approach to out of town
developments becomes clearer.
The group made the announcement as it revealed a sharp drop in interim
pre-tax profits from Pounds 7.07m to Pounds 2.08m, after exceptional charges
of Pounds 5.2m. Sales were 1 per cent ahead at Pounds 685m for the 26 weeks
to July 1.
The company, which has three Cargo Clubs either trading or under
construction, said it was unlikely to open any clubs next year because the
government had decided to review planning permission granted to its
Stockport site, near Manchester. N&amp;P did not expect a resolution of the
review before the spring.
The warehouse club concept is a key part of N&amp;P's plan to reduce its
dependence on the hard-pressed independent retailing sector. However, the
strategy could be hit by the government's campaign to curb the explosion of
out of town developments.
Mr Nigel Hall, Nurdin's finance director, said it was 'very difficult to say
whether we will win the review.' It was not clear why the DoE had chosen
Stockport over N&amp;P's planned club in Bristol, he said.
Nurdin's warehouse concept has run into further controversy with the group
last week referring Sony to the European Union over restricted supplies of
electrical goods to its clubs.
Apart from such issues, Mr Hall said the warehouse clubs were proving
successful. The first club at Croydon had 40,000 members and both visits and
spending per customer had increased. Development of the Cargo Clubs cost N&amp;P
Pounds 2.2m in exceptional charges in the first half, and was expected to
incur further charges of Pounds 4m.
The conversion of N&amp;P's traditional cash and carry businesses into Trade and
Business Warehouses serving caterers, businesses and independent retailers
was now complete, and had resulted in almost Pounds 3m in exceptional
charges. Marketing the concept would cost a further Pounds 1.5m in the
second half.
The M6 cash and carry chain acquired in May contributed Pounds 26m in sales,
but incurred losses. N&amp;P expected it to make further losses this year,
including costs of Pounds 1m, but contribute substantially to profits next
year.
The dividend is increased to 2.16p (2.06p). Earnings fell by 54 per cent to
1.77p.
Analysts said the underlying results, which showed a marginal increase in
profits, were good considering the continuing pressures on N&amp;P's main
customers. Full-year forecasts were for a sharp drop in profits from Pounds
32m to between Pounds 22m and Pounds 25m, after exceptionals.

FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Ethical adviser backs Body Shop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eiris, the ethical investment research service which advises ethical
investors, has given its backing to Body Shop, the natural cosmetics
retailer that has come under attack over its 'green' credentials.
In a report to clients, Eiris investigated claims made in an article by a US
investigative journalist in the magazine Business Ethics last week, and
concluded that Body Shop had been 'unfairly criticised'.
'A number of claims made in headlines have turned out to be untrue, or at
least misleading,' the report said. Body Shop's animal testing policy, while
differing from that of some 'green' groups, was defensible, and that its
charitable giving compared more favourably with other companies than the
article suggested.
It added that the company's environmental reporting record was 'among the
best in the UK' although it could be improved. Body Shop had had problems
with franchisees but was 'much the same as other people'. Eiris admitted the
scale of Body Shop's Trade Not Aid policy was small but it was at least a
practical step.
'Some criticisms remain, and there are ways in which Body Shop can improve
(as can every company),' the report said. 'The practical question for both
ethical investors and consumers remains: 'If not Body Shop, then who?''

per share amounted to 5.2p (4.2p) and a dividend of 2.7p (2.2p) will be
paid.
Mr James Frost, chairman, said the profits rise reflected 'not only the
acquisition programme of the last two to three years, but also the advances
made in our forecourt shops.'
Since the beginning of 1994 Frost, which trades as Save Service Stations,
has purchased or exchanged contracts on 37 new sites, bringing the total to
213 petrol filling stations or sites. Further acquisitions were likely, he
said.
The chairman said sales in the forecourt shops had been buoyant through the
recession and overall margins had been helped by the Smilies branded corner
shops introduced 18 months ago. 'We are replacing the traditional corner
shop with a service to the local community,' Mr John Murgatroyd, finance
director, said.
Mr Frost said motor fuel sales looked 'more positive than at any time over
the past three years'. The company's intention was to enter the motor fuel
wholesaling market next year and it would target a small number of the
12,000 privately owned petrol filling stations in the UK to supply under the
Save brand.
Mr Frost said sales on a site by site basis had been maintained despite a
2.3 per cent reduction in national motor fuel sales following the
introduction of additives to improve engine efficiency.
Last October Frost made a 5-for-1 rights issue to raise Pounds 21.3m. At the
interim stage it had net cash of Pounds 3m.

FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Overseas sales help Bluebird to Pounds 7.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bluebird Toys, maker of Polly Pocket and Mighty Max, more than trebled
interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.99m to Pounds 7.19m and declared its
first interim dividend.
Turnover for the six months to June 30 increased from Pounds 23.7m to Pounds
40.7m. Overseas sales soared 84 per cent to Pounds 28.7m and UK sales
improved by 49 per cent to Pounds 12m.
Mr Torquil Norman, chairman, said he was particularly pleased with the UK
performance, as the overall market had been flat.
'We have also improved our seasonality, which is magic in the toy industry,'
he said. The volume of business in the first half rose by five percentage
points to 40 per cent, helped by the increasing popularity of the group's
ranges overseas. It now sells to 70 countries.
The Polly Pocket range of miniature dolls, now in its fifth year, accounted
for 57 per cent of turnover. The company, which graduated to the main market
in July, expects to establish the range as a permanent brand. It is already
listed as a core brand by Mattel, the US toy group, which is Bluebird's
biggest overseas distributor.
Sales of Mighty Max, a pocket toy based on a mild horror theme, were 40 per
cent ahead in the UK in its second year.
This week the BBC started to show a TV series, already broadcast in the US,
based on the character.
Mr Norman said the company was bringing out a new range next year, and had
several other ranges in the long-term pipeline. 'We have a strong balance
sheet, a lot of cash in the bank and an enhanced development programme.'
Net interest payable fell from Pounds 591,000 to Pounds 198,000, and the
company expects to be interest positive in the second half.
Fully diluted earnings per share were 10.3p (3.7p), and aninterim dividend
of 2p will be paid.

FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Medicine man seeks cure for indigestion -
BBA is undergoing a thorough restructuring. Tim Burt reports on progress to
date
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Roberto Quarta, the Italian-American charged with resuscitating BBA
Group, regards the nickname 'Bob-the-Knife' as too harsh for the surgery he
is performing on the engineering and motor components group.
He admits, however, that the group has been forced to swallow some horrid
medicine in the eight months since his arrival from BTR, where he was chief
executive of the automotive, electronics and building divisions.
More than 2,000 jobs have gone, 1,400 of them through redundancy, and some
Pounds 18m has been spent on restructuring.
'It's tough - this is not aspirin I'm dishing out. It's pretty strong stuff
and in the right dosage it should bring the patient back to life.'
Although BBA discounts talk of a near-death experience, Mr Vanni Treves, the
chairman, acknowledges that its condition deteriorated rapidly last year.
He blames the problems, which forced the group to make restructuring
provisions of Pounds 72.1m in March, on the illness last year of Mr John
White, Quarta's predecessor, and the management time taken up in fighting a
Dollars 300m (Pounds 194m) lawsuit over the 1989 purchase of IGH, its US
industrial subsidiary.
'It was a severe distraction and we lost our way when John White had to
stand down,' he says.
City analysts, and to an extent Mr Quarta as well, believe the problems went
deeper.
'They've spent more than Pounds 350m on acquisitions in the past five years,
they're just too diverse,' says one analyst. Another describes Mr White as
an acquisition junkie who always expected the next deal to deliver the
volume sales to revive the group.
While more circumspect, Mr Quarta admits he was surprised to see BBA making
acquisitions 'before its new subsidiaries were bedded in'.
He has put a brake on that activity and instead identified some 12
subsidiaries for disposal with combined sales of more than Pounds 200m. Of
those, Holden Hydroman, Perplas and Railko have already been sold.
'But we don't have to sell cheap. The balance sheet is in fairly good shape
and we will wait for the right opportunities,' he adds.
The dilemma for BBA, however, is whether continued redundancies, disposals
and cost-cutting will leave the group with enough muscle to establish a
profitable foothold in its remaining core areas.
Analysts are sceptical. They warn that some businesses, such as Signature
Flight Support, the aviation refuelling and servicing group, may not achieve
Mr Quarta's target of 10 per cent margins by 1996.
'They are not large enough in aviation to cut costs and then drive up prices
to get those margins, and it's going to be very difficult in the automotive
businesses too,' according to one analyst.
Mr Quarta, however, is undeterred. He believes an ongoing management review,
which has seen the departure of three divisional executives, has helped
spread a new ideology.
Discounting the reduced sales of Pounds 711m, down from Pounds 742m,
announced in yesterday's interim figures, he says: 'I am changing the
culture. Unlike the previous management, I don't believe volume sales are
the answer to our prayers. Margins are more important.'
In pursuit of those margins, the group expects to use another Pounds 18m of
its provisions to make further job cuts in the second half and refocus the
group's three core sectors: automotive, industrial and transportation. That
strategy appears to have paid off in the six months to June 30 with a 15 per
cent increase in pre-tax profits before exceptional items to Pounds 38.2m.
The challenge for Mr Quarta is to ensure that BBA emerges fit enough to
compete in world markets.
Acknowledging the size of the problem, he admits: 'Cutting is a difficult
skill. If you're not careful you can end up with a business which can't
survive. I don't think that will happen here.
'We can do great things, but first we must get our house in order.'

FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Tough conditions in US behind decline at
Ocean
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ocean Group, the freight, environmental and marine services group, blamed
among other problems the difficult trading conditions in North America for
its international airfreight and logistics business for a decline in first
half profits.
The group, which also announced yesterday that Mr John Allan, a marketing
executive and main board director of BET, will become chief executive at the
end of this month, said pre-tax profits slipped by 5.3 per cent to Pounds
19.7m in the six months to June 30 from Pounds 20.8m in the 1993 first half.
Turnover grew by 12 per cent to Pounds 497m (Pounds 444m).
Earnings dipped from 9.4p to 9p per share, but the interim dividend is held
at 4.71p.
The shares closed 2p lower at 268p after Mr Peter Marshall, chairman, warned
that the outlook for the year 'remains uncertain with our businesses
operating in highly competitive markets.'
Operating profits fell to Pounds 22.3m (Pounds 24.4m) with MSAS, the
airfreight business, reporting a decline in profits to Pounds 1.9m (Pounds
2.6m) despite higher aircraft revenues.
Mr Marshall said that airlines had taken the opportunity of a firmer market
to increase rates, which tended to depress the profitability of MSAS in the
short term.
The main shortfall was in North America, where customs brokerage performed
poorly, but the group said the benefits of a restructuring in April, aimed
at saving Pounds 2m in a full year, were already becoming apparent.
McGregor Cory, the group's contract distribution business, also saw profits
fall although the UK operations performed well.
Cory Environmental lifted its profits contribution by 11 per cent to Pounds
2.1m, although the market for industrial waste treatment remained
unfavourable. NET, the US environmental testing business, incurred a Pounds
1.2m loss against a Pounds 200,000 profit in the 1993 first half.
Once again the results were underpinned by an improved performance in the
Marine operations, which reported profits of Pounds 16.2m (Pounds 14.6m).
OIL, the group's offshore supply business, had a good first half and pursued
opportunities in the important south-east Asia region. however, Mr Marshall
noted that political and economic uncertainties remained in West Africa.
COMMENT
Mr Allan faces a tough challenge re-shaping Ocean's rag-bag of businesses
and boosting the group's financial performance, which continues to
disappoint. In the meantime the company is leaning heavily on its marine
businesses, which include the uncertain West African offshore supply
operations. With uninspiring pre-tax profits of about Pounds 43.5m and
earnings of about 20p a share expected this year, the shares continue to be
supported by their 5 1/3 per cent yield.

FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Restructuring plans boost BBA shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in BBA Group rose 9p to 198p yesterday as the engineering and motor
components group signalled the first signs of a change in fortunes following
the start of its wide-ranging restructuring programme earlier this year.
Although pre-tax profits fell 54 per cent to Pounds 23.1m (Pounds 50.3m) in
the six months to June 30, the group said operating margins had improved and
cost-cutting should restore earnings growth.
Turnover declined to Pounds 711.1m, against Pounds 742m including Pounds
24.8m from discontinued activities, but operating profits before exceptional
items rose from Pounds 45.3m to Pounds 47.4m.
Mr Roberto Quarta, chief executive, highlighted an improvement in operating
margins from 6.1 per cent to 6.7 per cent following Pounds 18m of
restructuring costs in the first half.
'This is a healthy turnaround, and I believe we can get to double digit
margins by 1996,' he said.
Margins were boosted by an Pounds 11m saving on payroll costs as the group
cut the workforce by 7 per cent to 18,000.
Of the group's core businesses, which have been merged for reporting
purposes into two divisions, the industrial sector, comprising textiles, US
materials and specialist electrical equipment, reported increase profits of
Pounds 30m (Pounds 25.1m) as demand rose in continental Europe and North
America.
Transportation saw profits fall from Pounds 27.5m to Pounds 17.4m as a weak
performance by Page Avjet, its aircraft maintenance arm, undermined
improvements by the automotive businesses.
The figures were also dented by Pounds 13.1m of exceptional litigation costs
relating to the settlement of a US lawsuit and Pounds 2m of losses on
disposals.
Earnings per share fell from 6.8p to 1.5p, although they showed an increase
to 5.2p (3.9p) before exceptional items.
The interim dividend, as forecast in March, is cut from 2.25p to 1.5p. The
group said the full year figure would be not less than 4.5p.
COMMENT
BBA has bitten the bullet and these figures were ahead of the gloomy
forecasts. But with disposals, acquisitions, exceptionals and Pounds 72.1m
of provisions all affecting this year's profits, investors will have to make
a leap of faith in Mr Quarta if they expect short-term gains from the
company. Although full year profits should exceed Pounds 75m, the hefty
forward multiple of 19.4 makes the shares too pricey given the on-going
restructuring and redundancy costs. They look a more attractive prospect if
profits reach Pounds 100m next year, on a multiple of 15.8. Even then,
however, they would be no better value than blue chip rivals such as GKN and
T&amp;N.

FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Hillsdown beats tough markets with Pounds
65.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hillsdown Holdings lifted pre-tax profits by 5 per cent from Pounds 62.3m to
Pounds 65.6m in the first half of 1994, on the back of an increase in sales
from continuing operations from Pounds 1.94bn to Pounds 2.03bn.
Sir John Nott, chairman, said the group's restructuring had lopped Pounds
1bn off turnover in the past two years, with very little effect on profits.
'We have had a reasonable six months given the very difficult food markets
in the UK and in Canada.'
Mr David Newton, chief executive, said the results marked the third
half-year in a row when the results were broadly in line with expectations.
'We are not there yet - but we are moving in the right direction.'
Total turnover, including Pounds 9.7m from discontinued operations, was
2.04bn, down from Pounds 2.27bn previously, when discontinued operations
accounted for Pounds 331.8m.
Operating margins improved from 3.6 per cent to 4 per cent.
Sir John said the group was assuming no food price inflation, and was
looking for further efficiency to improve margins further.
It was also seeking bolt-on acquisitions similar to this week's purchase of
Materne-Fruibourg, the French jam maker, from Groupe Danone. The operation
would give Hillsdown a manufacturing and a distribution base in France.
Operating profits in four of the six divisions improved. The exceptions were
the ambient and chilled foods division, where profits fell by Pounds 1m to
Pounds 15.3m on sales of Pounds 307.6m, and the meat and produce division,
where profits declined from Pounds 8.3m to Pounds 7.8m on sales of Pounds
363.4m.
The former was hit by a baked bean price war, which more than offset good
results from the continental chilled salad operation.
Mr Newton said profits from canning had fallen by 60 per cent, mainly
because of a 50 per cent rise in the price of navy beans. The group, which
supplies supermarkets with own-label baked beans, is phasing out one of its
canneries.
The beverages and biscuits division raised profits by Pounds 2m to Pounds
5.9m on sales of Pounds 137.5m, helped by increased spending on brands.
Sales of Typhoo tea were 26 per cent ahead.
Profits in the poultry division improved from Pounds 12.3m to Pounds 14.2m
on sales of Pounds 245m, as its switch from frozen to fresh chicken
production started to reap benefits.
In the non-food division, where profits rose to Pounds 14.7m (Pounds 13.7m)
on sales of Pounds 209.3m, Fairview New Homes improved margins.
Net interest payable fell from Pounds 18.5m to Pounds 15.6m. Earnings per
share rose to 5.5p (5.1p).
The interim dividend is unchanged at 2.2p. Sir John said he hoped for 'a
more positive dividend policy at the end of the year,' given the group's
performance and cash generation.

FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Brent International at Pounds 4m following
restructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Keith Hutchings, promoted in March to chief executive of Brent
International, said that over the past year the speciality chemicals group's
businesses had been simplified and refocused into two divisions: printing
services and industrial. Management of most operating units had now been
replaced or restructured.
At the same time the group announced a 32 per cent rise in profits before
tax and exceptionals to Pounds 4.01m for the first half of 1994. After
exceptionals of Pounds 2.1m, last time's headline pre-tax figure was Pounds
931,000. The interim dividend remains 1.6p.
Mr Hutchings said the executives on the board were now settled following the
resignation of Mr Steve Cuthbert as chief executive in August 1993.
Mr Cuthbert's resignation was followed by a decline in profits to Pounds
7.14m (Pounds 11.5m) for 1993, accompanied by a cut in the total dividend to
4p (7.4p). Since then Mr Hutchings moved up from finance director, Mr Bill
Jessup returned to fill that post, and Mr Sandy Dobbie was hired as chief
operating officer this June.
In the half, performance of the printing services - to be overseen by Mr
Hutchings for the next 18 months - had been 'encouraging' with sales up 16
per cent to Pounds 11.2m. UK sales of inks and coatings advanced 25 per
cent. Divisional operating profits grew to Pounds 3.18m (Pounds 1.94m).
Profits on the industrial side fell to Pounds 1.96m, against Pounds 2.44m
(which included a Pounds 1.15m contribution from discontinued operations) on
turnover down at Pounds 30.8m (Pounds 35.5m). Mr Dobbie has specific
responsibility for the division for the next 18 months. Europe, with the
exception of the UK, where sales rose 18 per cent, and North America saw
'less than adequate' demand. Mr Hutchings said the group was pursuing 'niche
areas where we have an edge'.
Earnings per share were 3p (losses 0.5p).

FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Amec moves ahead to Pounds 9.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits of Amec, the international engineering and construction
group, increased slightly from Pounds 9.1m to Pounds 9.3m in the first six
months of 1994 in spite of a Pounds 3.2m loss on a property sale.
The shares rose 4p to 121p following an optimistic assessment by Sir Alan
Cockshaw, the chairman, of the trading outlook for the second half of this
year and in 1995.
The housing and property side would have made a small profit but for the
loss, due to an unforseen tax charge, on the sale of the company's Trafalgar
Place development.
Amec is maintaining the interim dividend at 1.5p. Sir Alan said that he
would consider whether to raise the 1.5p final 'in the light of trading
prospects for 1995'.
Earnings per share fell from 1.4p to 1.1p requiring an Pounds 800,000
transfer from reserves to meet the cost of the interim dividend.
Sir Alan said that trading conditions in general building and civil
engineering remained tough, but the group had made good progress in winning
higher margin overseas and specialist engineering work.
The group's determination to improve the quality of its order book by
rejecting underperforming contracts was reflected in a 17 per cent decline
in turnover from Pounds 1.12bn to Pounds 926m.
General building and civil engineering only broke even and made a loss in
the UK, offset by a return to the black by Morse Diesel in the US.
Divisional turnover rose from Pounds 346.3m to Pounds 348.9m.
Mechanical, electrical and process engineering profits rose from Pounds
10.9m to Pounds 15m in spite of a fall in turnover from Pounds 741.9m to
Pounds 525m. Profits continued to flow through from previous North Sea
hook-up contracts although work in this sector has declined.
Sir Alan said the company was winning better quality construction work in
the UK, while service contracts for the North Sea were compensating for a
lower level of fabrication and hook-up work. A higher proportion of work was
being won overseas.
COMMENT
Only Trafalgar House and BICC, among UK contractors can boast the range of
skills offered by Amec. Its problem is that margins for overseas work and
process engineering are still not great, albeit better than those for
general contracting. The group, moreover has managed to trip itself up in
recent years. Housing should show some sharp gains as margins rise. Amec
remains a quality business but needs to deliver better times rather than
just promising them. The long awaited settlement of the Tiffany contract may
help. Profits of Pounds 27m (excluding Tiffany) this year and Pounds 40m
next put Amec on prospective multiples of 23 and 16, which looks a little
dear.

FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Strong paper sales help Portals advance 20%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Continued strong papermaking sales helped Portals Group, the security and
specialist papermaker, lift first half pre-tax profits by 20 per cent to
Pounds 16.2m compared with Pounds 13.5m.
The advance, which was ahead of market expectations, reflected a 13 per cent
increase in paper sales together with a Pounds 568,000 swing from interest
payments to receipts.
Earnings per share in the six months to June 30 increased to 17.99p (15.04p)
and the interim dividend is raised to 5.75p (5.25p). The shares closed 20p
higher at 675p.
Underlining the group's confidence in the future of specialist paper Mr John
Lloyd, managing director, said a new Pounds 35m long fibre paper machine
would be built at the JR Crompton facility.
The decision comes only six months after the group announced plans for a
Pounds 19m paper machine at its Portals Limited banknote paper plant.
'With the two new paper machines costing over Pounds 50m and coming on
stream during 1996, we will have the substantial new capacity we need to
meet demand in our two main businesses,' said Mr Lloyd.
Operating profits increased by 15 per cent to Pounds 15.5m (Pounds 13.5m) on
turnover ahead 10 per cent at Pounds 100.3m (Pounds 91.2m).
Security and specialist papermaking led the advance with operating profits
up 20 per cent at Pounds 11.9m (Pounds 9.86m) on sales of Pounds 58.2m
(Pounds 51.6m). Demand remained strong and all the mills operated at close
to capacity. Banknote paper sales were 18 per cent ahead of last year, which
had a quiet start.
The protection and control division, as expected, reported a more modest 1.4
per cent increase in operating profits to Pounds 3.67m (Pounds 3.62m) on
sales up 6.3 per cent to Pounds 42.1m. Margins slipped to 8.7 per cent (9.1
per cent) partly reflecting the cost of investments in new products
including an integrated healthcare software package.
Pre-tax profits were also boosted by a Pounds 329,000 (Pounds 221,000)
exceptional profit on the sale of surplus property.
The group had net cash of Pounds 24.5m at the end of June, up Pounds 8.5m
from year-end, despite capital expenditure of Pounds 4.1m.

FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: UK performance helps Brammer climb to
Pounds 6.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Brammer, the industrial services group, climbed 55 per
cent from Pounds 4.23m to Pounds 6.54m in the six months to June 30.
'We've had three years of tough grind,' said Mr Robert Ffoulkes-Jones, chief
executive, 'and our market shrank by 25 per cent. Now we are seeing the
investment we've made paying off.'
The UK performance of both divisions - distribution and rentals - was
singled out, though progress had also been made in France.
Group turnover grew to Pounds 74.1m, against Pounds 71.2m which included
Pounds 5.05m from discontinued activities. Earnings per share topped 9p for
the first time since the first half of 1990, advancing 41 per cent to 9.7p
(6.9p), However the interim dividend is held at 4.5p. The shares closed up
5p at 365p.
The group was ungeared at the period-end and had enjoyed good cashflow. Mr
Ffoulkes-Jones said there was 'not a lot available in our specific area' on
the acquisitions front, but Brammer was looking in Germany, Spain and the
Benelux countries.
In the distribution division, operating profits grew 27 per cent to Pounds
5.25m on turnover up 11 per cent at Pounds 60.2m. Within that profits at
BSL, the power transmission distribution business, rose 28 per cent. Sales
at reorganised Roulement Service increased 18 per cent in the French market,
which grew by only 5 per cent.
On the rental side profits more than doubled to Pounds 1.75m (Pounds
837,000).

FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Wilson (Connolly) warns on costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ian Black, managing director of the housebuilder Wilson (Connolly)
Holdings, warned yesterday that 'inflationary evidence has appeared in the
costs of labour and materials, which has not yet been reflected in increased
house prices.'
Mr Black added that in the last eight months labour and material costs had
risen on average by 8 per cent, including a 15 per cent increase in the
price of bricks and concrete blocks. Bricklayers, he said, were being paid
between 10 and 20 per cent more.
Nevertheless, a 9 per cent increase in the number of homes sold by its
Wilcon Homes subsidiary helped push up group pre-tax profits by 62 per cent.
In the six months to June 30, pre-tax profits stood at Pounds 13.3m (Pounds
8.2). The housing division contributed Pounds 13.3m (Pounds 7.8m) and Pounds
1.2m (Pounds 39,000) came from property. Construction incurred a loss of
Pounds 1.15m, against profits of Pounds 221,000.
Turnover advanced 24 per cent to Pounds 127m (Pounds 102m) with the
strongest growth in housing, which had sales of Pounds 105m (Pounds 88.5m).
'Our planned volume growth in a low inflationary economy is showing signs of
success,' Mr Black said.
However, a strong first quarter had been followed by 'an easing off in the
rate of recovery.' Mr Black expected that house prices would rise only
marginally, keeping pace with inflation.
His warnings affected the share price, which fell 15p to 213p.
Mr Black said margins had improved from 10 per cent to 12 per cent, mainly
due to a higher proportion of sales of larger units. The average selling
price was Pounds 58,000 compared with Pounds 54,500. He said he expected the
trend in sales, up 9 per cent to 1,750, to remain the same.
An interim dividend of 1.36p (1.27p) was announced, on earnings of 4.7p
(2.9p).
The landbank stood at 14,400 plots at the end of June. Net cash was Pounds
25m.
Following the losses in the construction division, the company is
withdrawing from external contracting.
COMMENT
Wilson Connolly's concerns about higher labour and material costs made the
market nervous. It had assumed cost increases had been held at about 3 or 4
per cent rather than the 8 per cent indicated by Mr Black. With an operating
margin target of 14 per cent, the company is beginning to reach its peak.
However, it remains a benchmark for quality in the sector and is soundly
managed. With profit forecasts of Pounds 36m for 1994 and a prospective p/e
of more than 16, it's all in the price.

FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: NFC committed to value added business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NFC insisted yesterday that there was no management interregnum at the UK's
largest transport and logistics group, in spite of the sudden resignation
last month of its chief executive, Mr Peter Sherlock, after only 18 months
in the job.
Mr James Watson, chairman, said the group remained committed to its strategy
of focusing on higher value added business, such as logistics and moving
services, rather than routine transportation.
He said: 'We still have the same opportunities. In fact, I have been a
little disappointed about the limited speed of change so far.'
A new chief executive would be appointed as soon as possible. Both internal
and external candidates would be considered for the post.
The leading internal candidate is Mr Robbie Burns. In May, Mr Burns resigned
after 23 years with NFC, but rescinded his decision when Mr Sherlock left.
Mr Watson has increased his executive role and NFC yesterday spelled out the
responsibilities of its management committee, which is being chaired by Mr
Trevor Larman, finance director. Mr Sherlock had 15 operational executives
reporting directly to him, and the group was anxious to clarify its lines of
control.
Mr Burns will have direct responsibility for all logistics operation in the
UK and will chair the two logistics companies in North America, while Mr
Graham Roberts has assumed main board responsibilities for logistics in
mainland Europe.
Mr Larman will also chair the two main moving businesses, Allied Van Lines
in North America and Allied Pickfords Europe.
Mr Dennis Olliver will continue his responsibilities for Lynx, the parcels
business.
NFC confirmed that it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 76.8m in the 40 weeks
to July 9. This compared with Pounds 116.3m in the corresponding period,
which included an exceptional Pounds 50m profit on the disposal of its waste
management business. Stripping out exceptionals, pre-tax profits rose by 23
per cent.
Revenue from transport and logistics in the UK was marginally down at Pounds
631m, with operating profit slightly ahead at Pounds 45.2m.
Earnings before exceptional items were 8.8p (8.2p). A third interim dividend
of 1.6p brings payments for the year so far to 4.5p, an increase of 6.6 per
cent.

FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Baird to refocus activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
William Baird, one of Marks and Spencer's leading suppliers, yesterday
announced plans to withdraw from the engineering sector and concentrate on
its core clothing and textiles business.
Announcing flat first-half profits of Pounds 8.81m (Pounds 8.77m), the group
said its long-term aim was to sell its three remaining engineering
businesses.
'We want to focus on textiles and we will make disposals, although we're not
in any hurry,' said Mr Donald Barr, chairman.
The engineering division made a reduced contribution of Pounds 1.1m (Pounds
2.7m) following the disposal earlier this year of the UK businesses of
Darchem's building services division, a provider of relocatable
accommodation units, and some of the assets of the Dalfratex and Scotswood
businesses.
By comparison, the textiles division reported a 24 per cent increase in
operating profits to Pounds 8.7m (Pounds 7m) in the six months to June 30.
Sales by the division - comprising contract clothing, home furnishing,
fabrics and brand clothing - rose 15 per cent to Pounds 233.3m (Pounds
203.6m), and underpinned a rise from Pounds 230.7m to Pounds 240.5m in the
group total.
Of the textile businesses, the sharpest improvement was reported by contract
clothing, which increased profits from Pounds 2.63m to Pounds 4.38m
following a maiden first half contribution from Richard I Racke, the M&amp;S
supplier acquired last year.
Earnings per share were unchanged at 5.2p, and the interim dividend is
maintained at 3.55p.

FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Companies warm to Fids - The latest
dividend fad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some shareholders may look back with nostalgia to the days when a dividend
was a just dividend. After being treated to enhanced scrip dividends last
year many are now being offered a new variety - foreign income dividends
(Fids). This time the innovation has been rather better received.
Fids were introduced by the government to help companies that derive a large
proportion of profits from overseas. They can suffer an abnormally high
overall tax rate if their mainstream corporation tax liability is
insufficient to offset the advance corporation tax paid on dividends. Under
the new scheme they can reclaim ACT paid on a Fid if they can show the
dividend was funded out of foreign profits.
Companies were initially cautious about the idea, partly because it is
administratively complex, but also because the change benefits some
shareholders more than others. A conventional dividend is paid with a 20 per
cent tax credit which non-taxpayers, including pension funds, can reclaim.
Those paying tax at 20 per cent or 25 per cent face no further liability
while those on the top rate pay a further 20 per cent.
A Fid carries the normal 20 per cent tax credit but tax-exempt shareholders
can no longer obtain a repayment. For them, a Fid is worth 20 per cent less
than the same sum paid as a conventional dividend.
To compensate, companies introducing Fids are paying 25 per cent more than
they would have as a conventional dividend leaving the non-taxpayer
unaffected. For companies the higher payment is offset by a lower tax bill.
The beneficiaries are tax-paying shareholders, whose income rises by 25 per
cent.
Although institutions that do not benefit are still lukewarm, Fids are now
appearing in a flood. The first came from BAT Industries which announced in
March that it would pay its final dividend for last year as a Fid. However
Ladbroke, which announced in March it was looking at Fids, did not take
advantage of the new rules for its interim dividend last week and said it
had made no decision on the final.
The first Fid interim came this week from Coats Viyella while Burmah
Castrol, which is paying a conventional interim, announced that it would pay
part of the final as a Fid. Yesterday, RTZ declared a Fid interim and said
it would pay as much of its final as a Fid as would allow it to get back all
its ACT.
Mr Chris Bull, finance director, argues that even non-taxpaying shareholders
should benefit from the Fid. 'We have been writing off about Pounds 35m a
year of ACT which will now be available for distribution to shareholders. In
theory this should enhance the value of the shares, although the funds will
not be distributed to non-tax paying investors.'
Fids, however, pose a ticklish problem for the City: how are dividend yields
and cover to be calculated? For tax-paying shareholders, receiving a Fid
gives them a higher income than from the equivalent conventional dividend.
But for tax-exempt shareholders the yield is unchanged. The City needs to
decide which type of investor should be regarded as the norm.

FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Midlands Electricity to shed 1,200 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Midlands Electricity is to shed 1,200 jobs in the next three years as part
of a restruct-uring aimed at cutting costs by more than Pounds 30m a year.
The cutbacks of more than a fifth of the core business's 5,300 workforce are
the latest in a series among electricity companies following a recent
regulatory review.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour consumer spokesman, demanded a parliamentary
inquiry into the regional electricity companies. 'The companies are out of
control,' he said. 'Workers and customers are being made to pay for soaring
profits.'
Midlands' announcements follows similar moves at Norweb, also shedding 1,200
jobs and Manweb, where 500 are going.
Mr Bryan Townsend, Midlands chairman, said he expected the company to be
able to increase dividend payments by a minimum of 5 to 6 per cent in real
terms for the five-year duration of the regulatory regime.
Some 700 of the job losses will result from the replacement of six
geographic operating division by four next April and changes in the
company's headquarters functions. Midlands intends to achieve the cuts
through voluntary means. Over the past three years manpower has fallen by
900.
Unlike Manweb, Midlands is not making any additional financial provision for
the restructuring. The regulatory review resulted in a 14 per cent cut in
Midlands' allow-able charges from next April.
However Midlands is one of the few companies which does not charge the full
allowable amount in the current year. As a result, it says, the initial
reduction in regulated income in 1995/96 will be some Pounds 20m, a nominal
reduction of 6.1 per cent.

FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: UAPT says yes to Equifax offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UAPT-Infolink, the British credit reference company, has recommended
shareholders to accept the Pounds 51m offer from Equifax after the US credit
data group learned that its bid of 650p per share would not be referred to
the Monopolies and Merger Commission.
UAPT's board had previously recommended a 550p per share offer from Trans
Union, Equifax's main competitor in the US, because Trans Union had no UK
operations and so did not risk a referral to the MMC. Equifax already owns a
credit information business in the UK. However, UAPT's board later rescinded
its recommendation, effectively leaving the outcome of the bidding war to
the Office of Fair Trading.

RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, yesterday pleased the London stock
market by reporting interim profits at the top end of analysts' expectations
and announcing that it was to be the latest big British company to pay a
foreign income dividend (Fid).
Fids allow significant advance corporation tax (ACT) savings for companies
that generate nearly all their income outside the UK. In the first half,
only 1 per cent of RTZ's net earnings arose in Europe, including the UK.
Mr Bob Wilson, chief executive, said a combination of lower tax, higher
volumes, improved metals prices and reduced costs helped to lift pre-tax
profits by 26 per cent from Pounds 339m to Pounds 427m in the six months to
June 30.
Volume increases boosted net earnings by Pounds 25m compared with the first
half of 1993, mainly from new or recent investments such as the Flambeau
copper and gold mine and the Powder River Basin coal operations, both in the
US, and the first two expansions of the Escondida copper mine in Chile.
Higher prices contributed an extra Pounds 16m. Cost savings totalled Pounds
17m.
Mr Wilson said the underlying world economic outlook was brighter than it
had been since the 1980s.
The US economy was firm, Europe was recovering and Japan at least had hit
bottom. Other Asian markets remained promising, although there were some
doubts about China.
First-half turnover rose by 10 per cent to Pounds 1.86bn. Earnings per share
were up 6 per cent from 24.9p to 26.3p. Excluding exceptional items, they
rose by 30 per cent from 17.5p to 22.7p.
Operating cash flow remained strong at Pounds 336m. Net debt fell to Pounds
196m from Pounds 384m at the end of December, and represented only 5 per
cent of total capital.
The tax charge fell from 39.5 per cent to 31.9 per cent, mainly because
there was no provision for write-off of surplus ACT. Mr Chris Bull, finance
director, said it would be prudent in future to assume the charge would be
about 33 1/3 per cent.
RTZ increased its dividend by the amount of ACT saved. Mr Bull insisted that
the move to Fids would leave UK tax-exempt shareholders no worse off but
taxpayers would be 25 per cent better off.
He said it was not possible to offer a scrip alternative to a Fid but at the
year-end RTZ intended to recommend a mixture of Fids and conventional
dividends which would allow it to continue to make the scrip alternative
available.
The Fid per share is 9p. The 1993 interim dividend was 13.5p, but RTZ said
this was not comparable because of the way it structured last year's
dividends.
RTZ shares closed 13p higher at 885p.

FT  08 SEP 94 / 'Telecom shock' hits Japanese market
</HEADLINE>

'Telecom shock' has hit the Tokyo stock market.
Shares in Japan Telecom, the country's third largest telecommunications
company, have fallen by 5.7 per cent from their issue price of Y4.7m
(Dollars 47,600) since trading began on Tuesday,
Yesterday alone, Japan Telecom shares lost Y220,000, or 4.7 per cent, to
close at Y4.43m. The decline washed into the wider market, pushing the
Nikkei 225 index down by 370.18, or 1.8 per cent, to 20,023.80.
Japanese stockbrokers have been caught out. 'We thought Telecom would bring
investors back to the market,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki, general manager at Nikko
Securities.
Brokers had hoped that the Japan Telecom listing would revive the market.
'Telecom shock' has raised worries over next month's Y900bn (Dollars 9.1bn)
flotation of Japan Tobacco, the semi-privatised tobacco and salt company.
Although public pension and insurance funds moved to stem the Nikkei's fall
yesterday, recent declines have confirmed weak underlying sentiment.
The Nikkei rose 24 per cent during the first six months of 1994 on buying
from the US and Europe, but a widening belief that corporate earnings would
improve only gradually weighed on share prices in recent months.
Investors fear a repeat of last year's decline triggered by the flotation of
East Japan Railway which dropped Y1,000bn worth of shares on the market. The
Tokyo stock exchange's computer system almost collapsed due to a surge of
sell orders, prompting the Nikkei to lose more than 20 per cent in a month.

FT  08 SEP 94 / IBM's European head resigns: Successor named amid rumours of
radical restructuring by troubled computer group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European head of Inter-national Business Machines has resigned after
less than a year in the post, prompting speculation of radical restructuring
in the European operations of the troubled computer manufacturer.
IBM said Mr Hans-Olaf Henkel was resigning as chairman and chief executive
of IBM Europe to return to Germany, where 'a significant career opportunity'
had opened for him. Mr Henkel was president of IBM Germany until last year.
He is being replaced by Mr Lucio Stanca, currently general manager of IBM's
operations in southern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, based in Rome. Mr
Stanca will be IBM Europe's third head in just over three years.
IBM stressed that Mr Henkel's decision was 'entirely personal with no
strategic implications', but it made no attempt to disguise the suddenness
of the move.
Mr Henkel will hand over his responsibilities as chief executive with
immediate effect, and will remain chairman of the IBM Europe board - a post
he assumed only in January - until the next board meeting in early December.
Mr Henkel expressed confidence two months ago in the future of IBM Europe
and gave no hint that he was contemplating a move.
His resignation comes amid indications that IBM is re-evaluating its
European operations, aiming to give a greater international focus to its
marketing.
IBM's Italian operations have received strong ratings from analysts, with Mr
Stanca - a respected Italian public figure - seen as anxious to safeguard
its autonomy. However, the parent company said yesterday that his
appointment would not herald immediate changes, and denied that any wider
re-evaluation was in progress.
The recession and radical reshaping of the computer market continue to have
a traumatic impact on IBM, notably in Europe. The company has shed nearly
30,000 jobs across Europe since its peak in the late 1980s, reducing its
workforce from 112,000 to 85,000, with another 10,000 posts are to be lost
this year. The worldwide workforce will be cut by a further 20,000 this year
to 215,000 and more job cuts appear likely in 1995.
The cost cutting appears to have stabilised IBM's position. Its
second-quarter earnings, announced in late July, showed higher than expected
earnings on the back of sharp reductions in expenses.
IBM said demand for mainframe computers was strong but it still faced
'serious problems' in its personal computer operations.
IBM's second-quarter earnings of Dollars 689m (Pounds 445m), equal to
Dollars 1.14 per share, were well above analysts' estimates of 45-80 cents
per share. For the same period in 1993 IBM had reported a loss of Dollars
40m, or 8 cents per share, before heavy restructuring charges bringing net
losses to Dollars 8bn.
In terms of sales, however, Europe was static for the second quarter at
Dollars 5.5bn, with increases for the group reliant on growth in the
Asia-Pacific region which picked up 14 per cent to Dollars 2.8bn.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Halifax held to 18% rise by higher expenses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Halifax Building Society, the UK's largest mortgage lender, yesterday
reported an increase of 18 per cent in pre-tax profits for the six months to
July 31, taking the total from Pounds 411m to Pounds 486m.
The percentage increase was less marked that that reported by some other
mortgage lenders, but as has been true across the sector, it was primarily
attributable to a fall in provisions for bad and doubtful debts, from Pounds
156m to Pounds 56m.
Mr Jon Foulds, chairman, said that Halifax had produced strong results
against a very weak housing market. There was a small increase in net
interest receivable, from Pounds 738m to Pounds 783m. This reflected a
narrower margin - 2.29 per cent compared with 2.31 per cent - on a higher
volume of business.
Administrative expenses rose from Pounds 357m to Pounds 385m, an increase of
8 per cent, while other income and charges fell back slightly from Pounds
183m to Pounds 176m.
Mr David Gilchrist, corporate development manager, said that there had
perhaps been a slight fall in the sale of endowment mortgages which had
affected commission earnings.
Much of the increase in expenses came from the rising cost of meeting
financial services regulators' requirements, he said.
In January, Halifax will take on all the compliance costs when it sets up a
wholly-owned life insurance subsidiary, ending its current arrangement by
which it sells financial services policies produced by Standard Life.
Mr Gilchrist said that if the mortgage market remained flat, then the
savings side of the society's business could become increasingly important
and an area of growth.
In the six months to July 31, Halifax's retail balances fell slightly by
Pounds 151m, even when interest automatically credited to customers'
accounts is included. Mr Gilchrist made it clear, however, that the society
was determined to maintain its retail savings base. It had, for example,
increased savers' rates in July.
As a result of the slight outflow while the society was competing for
mortgage business, the proportion of funds raised on the wholesale money
markets rose to 21.1 per cent. This is well within the regulatory limits on
societies' wholesale funding ratios, but higher than the 15.2 per cent in
the 1993 interim results.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Bancassurance's golden egg loses some of its shine: Alison
Smith doubts the benefit of diversification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When one of the UK's larger and steadier retail financial organisations  -
Halifax Building Society - plans to set up its own life insurance
subsidiary, it may seem heretical to question the benefits of bancassurance.
Yet half-year results for organisations which have set up subsidiaries
suggest limitations on the strategy - which involves selling financial
services products through bank and building society branch networks.
The most spectacular drop was at Black Horse Financial Services, the Lloyds
Abbey Life arm which sells only to customers of Lloyds Bank, which reported
a 40 per cent drop in sales for the first half of the year. Other
bancassurers also reported flat or worse results.
The underlying logic behind bancassurance remains: it offers a low-cost,
high-productivity method of distribution. A wholly-owned subsidiary gives
the bancassurer control over the product and gives it all the profit from
sales.
But bancassurers are affected, like their competitors, by pressures such as
the increasing costs of meeting regulators' training and compliance
procedures.
'The typical Barclays customer will have a relationship with a number of
other providers who are in bancassurance as well,' says Mr Ken Bignall,
chairman of Barclays Life.
The specific limits within which bancassurance works helps to keep costs
down, but also mean checks on their growth.
At Woolwich Life, the jointly-owned subsidiary of Woolwich Building Society
and Sun Alliance insurance, the range of products is deliberately
mortgage-related.
Mr Michael Turner, chief executive, says this enables them to focus training
and systems on these products. However, it provides less prospect of
developing income streams which are particularly beneficial when the housing
market is depressed. 'The mortgage market has been pretty flat, and business
has been mirroring that,' he says.
Bancassurers restrict themselves to the bank's customer bases. This may not
seem much restriction when, as in the case of Barclays and TSB Group this
can total 7m, but only TSB believes it can aim to provide financial services
to more than half its customers. Most other bancassurers expect about a 30
per cent penetration of the retail customer base.
Mr Stephen Maran, chief executive of Lloyds Abbey Life, says that while
there is a finite customer base, customers who have bought life insurance
once are likely to do so again. He adds, however, that the customer base
will mature over time. 'Then you have to find other affinity groups, and do
the same.'
A further restriction lies in customers' tendency to think of financial
institutions in separate categories, even when they offer similar ranges of
services.
A poll for the National Consumer Council in July showed that for current
accounts people were most likely to go to a bank, but for life insurance
most likely to go to a life company.
Mr Nathan Moss, managing director of Midland Bank personal finance, admits
that the expansion of the range of services does take time to feed through.
Similarly, Mr Lawrence Churchill, chief executive of NatWest Life, says that
only about 30 per cent of National Westminster customers realise they can go
to the bank for a pension plan. 'We have to build awareness that NatWest is
not just where you go for cash.'
There are two other increasing restrictions. The more important is the drop
in bank customers visiting bank branches.
A recent survey by Mori for ICL the computer company suggested that only
around two-thirds of bank customers enter their branch regularly. Some
bankers say even that figure seems too high.
Banks then have to develop other strategies for contacting customers, such
as direct mail, where the impact of the brand and the existing relationship
may be diluted.
'We have to use a different communication channel to speak to these
customers,' says Mr Peter Ellwood, TSB group chief executive. 'We now get
quite a lot of our contacts from writing to customers. We can also speak to
customers over the phone.'
Secondly the passing of information about customers from the bank to a life
insurance subsidiary, is being restricted under pressure from consumer
groups.
The financial services industry is under pressure both for conventional life
companies or bancassurers. As the number of bancassurers increases, so their
total market share is likely to increase as well, but perhaps not at the
overall volumes of business or at the profitability that might once have
been envisaged.
As Mr Bignall says:'I think the advantage of bancassurers has been
significantly exaggerated'.

FT  08 SEP 94 / New Sharp microwave smells success in the kitchen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW DERRINGTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LOUGHBOROUGH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sharp, the Japanese electronics group, is to install an electronic nose into
microwave ovens manufactured at its plant in Wrexham in north Wales.
Smell sensors in the oven will feed information into a neural network
programmed to recognise the characteristics of different foods when they are
cooked.
Neural networks are computers, inspired by models of the brain, that can be
built to recognise complex patterns.
Sharp is refusing to discuss its new product before its official
announcement on Monday, but journalists who have a smell of the story expect
to be told that it will mean the end of the over-cooked and dried up food
that inexperienced cooks find all too easy to produce with current
microwaves.
The advantage of using a neural network is that cooking is a complex process
and it is difficult to decide when it is complete. Even the same kind of
food needs different amounts of cooking depending on its size and shape. For
example thick steaks need to be cooked for longer than thin steaks.
Several different types of information - on temperature, colour and smell -
are needed to know that cooking is done, and of course different cooks have
different views on what constitutes rare, medium or well-done.
The neural network will be programmed in the factory, so the microwave will
arrive in the home already knowing how Sharp thinks food should be cooked.
It is not known whether it will be adjustable for vegetables al dente.
Sharp's plant in Wrexham, which opened in 1975, manufactures microwaves,
VCRs, typewriters, and word processors. It employs 1,300 people, and
production in the last financial period was valued at Pounds 120m according
to Mr Mike Williams, director of personnel and general affairs.
Sharp had been planning a press conference in Wrexham on Monday to announce
the new microwave, with the company's president, Mr Haruo Tsuji, flying in
from Japan to make the announcement. A government minister was also thought
to be scheduled to attend.
But information about the new product leaked out at the British Association
festival of science in Loughborough yesterday, at a meeting to discuss
applications of neural networks.
Asked about the announcement, Ms Caroline Barratt, head of public relations
for Sharp UK said: 'As far as Sharp is concerned we have a press conference
on Monday.'

FT  08 SEP 94 / US says Japan trade talks still far from breakthrough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The top US trade negotiator warned yesterday that the US and Japan are still
a long way from any agreement in their framework trade negotiations, and
that no breakthrough was likely in talks this week.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said he did not expect that
'any dramatic announcements or breakthroughs in the near term' would follow
his meeting in Washington yesterday afternoon with Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto,
Japan's trade minister, nor his talks today with Mr Yohei Kono, the Japanese
foreign minister and deputy prime minister.
'I think this is a time for listening and exchanging ideas,' Mr Kantor said.
This sober assessment of the chances of a quick agreement came as the clock
ticked away towards a September 30 deadline, when the US must decide whether
to impose sanctions on Japan in retaliation for what it sees as unfair trade
practices.
Mr Kantor said no decisions had yet been made on sanctions. 'We are going to
listen and listen carefully,' he said.
But Japanese officials in Washington warned that they would not take US
sanctions lying down, and might instead take the issue to a panel of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
None of the three sectors targeted by the US-Japanese framework agreement -
government procurement, cars and car parts, and insurance - appears close to
resolution, although Japanese officials are more hopeful than their US
counterparts about an insurance deal.
In talks on government procurement, the two sides are still far apart over
how to measure progress in expanding foreign bidders' access to the Japanese
market. This reflects the broader disagreement between the US and Japan over
whether the use of numerical indicators to measure progress amounts to the
setting of unacceptably inflexible targets.
Japan complains that the US insists on an indicator tilted towards a
substantial increase in market share in each monitoring period, while Japan
wants a neutral indicator of progress.
The car and car parts talks are even further from agreement. Japanese
officials point proudly to statistics showing a 47 per cent increase in
imports of US automobiles in the first seven months of this year, even while
the overall Japanese car market has shrunk.
But they balk at giving any kind of government assurance to back up the
Japanese carmakers' voluntary commitment to increase their purchases of
US-made auto parts. The US is also seeking to add flat glass to the sectors
under discussion.

FT  08 SEP 94 / French business chiefs 'believe corruption rife'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Two out of three French company chairmen suspect that illegal practices are
rife in many companies, according to a poll published in today's Le Monde
newspaper.
More than half of businessmen believe France should launch an Italian-style
crackdown on white collar crime, the poll finds.
Its publication follows Tuesday's news that Mr Jean-Louis Beffa, chairman of
the Saint-Gobain glass group, has become the latest prominent French
industrialist to be placed under judicial investigation.
Mr Beffa was questioned by a magistrate looking into claims that in 1988
Pont-a-Mousson, a pipemaking subsidiary of Saint-Gobain, paid FFr4.4m
(Pounds 520,000) to a Nantes businessman to secure a water supply contract.
It is claimed the money was then given to an official of the Republican
party, which is led by Mr Gerard Longuet, industry minister, and Mr Francois
Leotard, defence minister. Mr Longuet, on French radio, praised Mr Beffa as
'an extraordinary man' and said the party had 'nothing to do' with the
investigation.
The Beffa probe comes at a time when France's investigating magistrates are
taking a tougher line on corporate fraud. Mr Pierre Blayau, who worked at
Pont-a-Mousson in 1988 but now heads Pinault-Printemps, France's largest
retail group, has been under investigation in the same case since May.
Mr Pierre Suard, chairman of the Alcatel-Alsthom electronics concern, faces
accusations of using corporate money for work on his home. Mr Pierre Berge,
head of the Yves Saint-Laurent fashion house, was investigated for insider
trading.
Earlier this summer, Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, chairman of the Schneider
electric engineering group, was held in custody in Brussels while being
questioned in a fraud probe. Mr Bernard Tapie, the controversial
entrepreneur and Euro-MP, faces a battery of charges ranging from tax
evasion to trying to cover up a bribery scandal at his football club.
At least 100 less newsworthy businessmen are also believed to be under
investigation.
Publicly, most French businessmen and politicians claim to favour a
clean-up. The Le Monde poll backs a similar poll in the latest Enjeux Les
Echos magazine, which found that 56 per cent of chairmen advocated a
crackdown. Mr Patrick Devedjian, a Gaullist MP, yesterday called on French
radio for the company heads under investigation to resign.
Yet there is growing concern about the ferocity of the recent probes and the
adverse publicity they generate.
The news of the Beffa probe on Tuesday took a heavy toll on Saint-Gobain's
shares and the entire Paris stock market. However, Saint-Gobain's shares
yesterday rallied by 1.1 per cent to FFr645.
Mr Louis Giral, a candidate for the chair of the Patronat, the
representative body of France's industrialists, yesterday called for a halt
to 'this massacre game'. Justice must be done, he said 'but I wish that the
judges were aware of the implications of hauling in the head of a company'.

FT  08 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Hillsdown Holdings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On the surface the market's attitude to Hillsdown Holdings seems a bit
churlish. Despite the improvements wrought by the new management - assets
generating some Pounds 1bn of turnover have been sold in the last couple of
years with virtually no loss in profit - Hillsdown's shares still carry a
yield of more than 6 per cent. That looks high for a company which claims to
have turned the corner, is now generating cash and is talking about
acquisitions and higher dividends. But Hillsdown must pay the price for its
failure to cut its dividend in the recession. Even now its payment is less
than twice covered.
Memories of the bad times will be slow to fade. After all, profits fell by
more than half between 1989 and 1992. The market, too, needs more evidence
of Hillsdown's ability to grow. Since there is not much sign of food price
inflation in the shops, margin improvement will require tough control on
costs and a judicious juggling of product mix. Recognising the need for
acquisitions is one thing. Finding suitable ones is another. Hillsdown
implicitly admits as much by clinging to its housebuilding assets on the
grounds that it could not easily replace them with a more lucrative
investment in food.
Nor has the market failed to recognise the improved outlook. Hillsdown
trades on a higher multiple than both Unigate and Northern Foods and has
out-performed the sector by 30 per cent since the start of last year. That
looks like enough for the moment. The muted reaction to yesterday's promise
of resumed dividend growth suggests the proof of the pudding will be the
rate of earnings expansion rather than higher payouts.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It will be long before many Americans turn on their personal computers
instead of motoring down to the mall for their shopping. But Home Shopping
Network's acquisition of the Internet Shopping Network brings that day
somewhat closer. Until now, most companies retailing goods over the Internet
 -including ISN itself - have been small start-up ventures. HSN, which owns
the US's largest cable tv shopping channel, has the financial firepower to
develop computer shopping. It also brings established relationships with a
multitude of manufacturers and retailers.
In the longer term, TV and computer shopping should merge. With the advent
of cable modems, ordinary TV sets will become interactive. People will no
longer sit passively as goods are paraded in front of them and then place
orders over the telephone. Instead, they will be able to search for items
and buy them with the press of a button. Similarly, computer shopping -
which still consists mainly of scrolling through text listings - will
increasingly be enlivened by moving pictures. HSN may have gained something
of a head-start by acquiring ISN, but the field promises to be crowded.
Computer groups such as Microsoft, telecommunications operators and rival
cable shopping channels such as QVC are all eyeing the opportunities.

FT  08 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Japanese equities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It may be wrong to pin the blame for yesterday's fall in the Tokyo market on
the 5 per cent fall in Japan Telecom's share price. But the issue's
high-profile flop has certainly put the Japanese system for pricing equity
offerings under the spotlight. Japan Telecom was designed to appeal to
foreigners. There is a danger that it will instead reinforce investor
suspicions that buying new Japanese equity is a quick way to lose money.
Japan's system for pricing issues was introduced following the Recruit share
scandal of the late 1980s. Then the problem was that new issues typically
shot to handsome premiums and so companies could reward their friends by
allocating them shares. But in combating corruption, the current system has
brought its own problems.
The main difference between the Japanese system and the 'bookbuilding'
process used in most international equity issues is that the price is set
through an auction near the start of the offering period rather than near
the end. The delay between pricing an issue and trading means the share
price is a hostage to wider market movements. Investors also have less time
to analyse a stock before placing their bids.
Japan Telecom is due to be followed by several other large issues. Japan
Tobacco is next in line and two railway companies, JR West and JR Central,
are expected next year. It is too late to alter the system for the Tobacco
sale. But if future flotations are to attract foreign investors, Tokyo will
need to bring its issuing practices closer to international standards.

FT  08 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: RTZ rides the cycle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RTZ is not just a reflection of the commodity price cycle. What it controls
it controls well. In most sectors, the group remains the lowest-cost
producer. Operating margins at the bottom of the cycle were a creditable 13
per cent. These have now reached 23 per cent, an increase admittedly helped
by the disposal of Pillar's rag-bag of low-margin businesses. More
cost-cutting is promised. As for volume growth, RTZ continues to invest in
new projects. Capital investment nearly doubled in the first half, and
exploration spending on long-term projects is up two-thirds.
But RTZ cannot control prices. Recent rises augur well. Since June
non-ferrous metal prices have ad-vanced 16 per cent, those of copper by 23
per cent and aluminium by 18.6 per cent. Such increases have contributed
heavily to the shares' advance.
Less clear is whether these higher prices are sustainable. Habitually
cautious RTZ managers are unusually upbeat about economic prospects. The
leading economies appear to be lining up in the same direction, offering the
prospect of synchronous economic growth. The danger is that the commodity
market, pushed partly by speculators' hot-money, has over-anticipated the
recovery. As in the plastics and paper industries, where prices have also
moved forward sharply, much of the increased demand has come from
restocking. If stocks fail to fall this autumn, metals prices could suffer a
correction. That would knock inflationary pressures on the head. But it
would also shake stocks like RTZ which have risen on expected further price
rises.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Open science
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Hunt, who makes his first public appearance as science minister at
the British Association meeting in Loughborough today, could do one thing to
please all sections of his new constituency without committing the cabinet
to an extra penny of public spending. He should announce an initiative to
open up to public scrutiny the scientific committees that advise the
government on a vast range of subjects, from genetic engineering to nuclear
waste. At present all meet in private. In future, their meetings should
normally be held in public, with appropriate arrangements to protect
commercially confidential information.
Such a move would be overwhelmingly popular with all sections of scientific
opinion. The advocates of open scientific advice include not only academic
researchers and environmental and consumer groups but also the biotechnology
industry. Companies complain that the present system gives the false
impression that they have something to hide.
Instead of the slow and secretive British system, the industry would prefer
a quick public assessment of applications to carry out genetic engineering
experiments, along US lines. A model is the US Recombinant DNA Advisory
Committee. The first meeting of the Rac, as it is known, attracted 150
journalists in 1990; now a handful of reporters and other outside observers
monitors its deliberations.
Mr Hunt could make a modest start with a co-ordinated effort to open up the
expert committees advising on biotechnology, such as the Genetic
Manipulation Advisory Committee, Advisory Committee on Releases into the
Environment, and Gene Therapy Advisory Committee. But there is no reason to
stop there. All committees giving independent scientific advice to the
government, outside the specific field of defence and national security,
should meet in public, as their US counterparts do under the government in
the Sunshine Act. Meanwhile, the policymaking committees of ministers and
civil servants would, of course, remain closed as at present.
The opening-up process should also extend to advisory committees on the
civil nuclear industry, where the history of secrecy has left a legacy of
public distrust which the young biotechnology industry rightly sees as an
awful warning. As in the US, arrangements can be made to protect genuinely
sensitive information without shrouding the whole procedure in secrecy.
The scientific community was sad to lose Mr William Waldegrave, the most
popular science minister for many years, to agriculture in the July cabinet
reshuffle. An open advice initiative would be an ideal way for Mr Hunt to
establish his credentials as Mr Waldegrave's successor with the scientific
world. At the same time, it would send a strong message that momentum has
not been lost on another of his responsibilities: open government.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Fresh meat from Europe's stable: The motives behind
controversial French and German suggestions for developing the EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others' -
George Orwell, Animal Farm, 1945
Since its inception, the European Union has rejected the notion of first-
and second-class citizens. Talk of inner circles or exclusive clubs has
always been taboo, despite stark differences in wealth, size and population
among the member states.
Now Germany, the biggest and most powerful member of the club, has broken
ranks. Last week, the ruling Christian Democrat party and its CSU coalition
partners came out in favour of a Franco-German-led 'hard core' of five
nations committed to faster integration. The paper, echoing similar thinking
within the French government, ended an uneasy truce over the pace and scope
of integration which has prevailed since last November's ratification of the
Maastricht treaty.
Whether by accident or design, the Germans have triggered a debate on the
issue at the heart of the EU's inter-governmental conference in 1996 to
review Maastricht: how can the Union preserve its integrated structure while
embracing an ever-increasing number of member states, notably the former
communist countries of central and eastern Europe?
Most member states would prefer not to peep into this Pandora's box.
Organising a European Union of 20 to 25 member states will require an
overhaul of EU institutions and procedures, which could jeopardise the
delicate balance of national interests that has ensured political stability
in western Europe for more than a generation.
In an expanded Union, tiny Luxembourg (population 450,000) could not reckon
on preserving its disproportionate voting power in EU decision-making. The
'Club Med' countries of Greece, Spain and Portugal risk reductions in
regional aid to accommodate the east Europeans. 'All these changes awaken
fears among smaller and poorer states of being marginalised,' says a
Commission official.
For the UK government, the contents of the CDU/CSU paper threaten to reopen
civil war in the ruling Conservative party. Mr John Major, prime minister,
papered over divisions during his speech in Leiden yesterday, which called
for new, flexible methods of co-operation while rejecting the idea of a
two-tiered Europe. But he remains trapped between Euro-philes, worried about
Britain being left in Europe's slow lane, and Euro-sceptics, resolutely
opposed to further dilutions of national sovereignty.
This week's diplomatic storm surrounding the CDU/CSU 'discussion paper'
would have passed quickly had its authors avoided naming countries which
they deemed worthy of membership of a hard core: the assumption that not all
countries would enter tighter economic and monetary union on schedule by
1997-99 is hardly new. Indeed, the Maastricht treaty explicitly provides for
a 'multi-speed' formation. But by excluding Italy (a founder member of the
European Community in 1957) as well as Spain and the UK, the German paper
pre-empted a future decision on which countries will qualify for Emu and
caused a needless slight.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's explanation that the CDU/CSU paper was not official
government policy served only to fuel questions about the timing and motives
behind it. Some observers viewed the paper as floating a trial balloon
staking out the German position ahead of 1996; others saw it as a
pre-emptive warning to the British and the Danes, the 'semi-detached'
members of the Union, who have long sought to temper enthusiasm on the
continent for faster, deeper integration.
Both views may overlook narrower German calculations linked to next month's
general election. Mr Wolfgang Schauble, second only to Mr Kohl in the CDU
hierarchy, and Mr Karl Lamers, the CDU's chief foreign affairs spokesman,
launched the paper in the apparent hope that it would prevent the party's
more conservative supporters defecting to fringe German nationalist parties.
Significantly, the CSU came on board, despite the misgivings of Mr Edmund
Stoiber, the CSU's Bavarian prime minister and avowed Euro-sceptic.
Yet it is also clear that Mr Kohl and his closest advisers are convinced
that the time is ripe for an open debate about the future of European
integration and Germany's place in it. Mr Kohl remains determined to avoid a
repeat of the Maastricht experience, when Europe's policymaking elite lost
touch with the public.
The paper's implicit message is that a frank exchange must take place with
France, Germany's most important ally. In blunt terms, it points to
differences on economic policy, including competition law, the objectives of
the common agricultural policy, industrial policy and trade. The paper says
that, if Germany puts forward plans for deeper political integration, France
must reciprocate with 'equally clear and unequivocal decisions'.
'France must agree to a common European foreign policy, not just continue
with a French foreign policy,' says a German official in Brussels.
In a striking passage, the authors argue that France's 'basic' commitment to
deeper integration remains indisputable; but they proceed to fret about
French attachment to the nation state. 'The notion of the unsurrendable
sovereignty of the 'Etat nation' still carries weight, although this
sovereignty has long since become an empty shell.'
The dilemma Germany and France face is how to preserve their alliance while
simultaneously widening EU membership to eastern Europe. As the CDU/CSU
paper implicitly acknowledges, enlargement serves Germany's economic and
geographical interests; but it also risks diluting France's political
leadership role in the Union.
France was a reluctant convert to the present enlargement of the Union to
encompass Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway - partly because it appeared
to expand Germany's sphere of influence and tilt the Union northwards.
A senior Commission official predicts that the French will come round to
enlargement. Yet he warns that the Union will tilt even further east: 'The
first round of enlargement will be Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and
Slovakia, but the second round will come soon after. That means Slovenia,
the Baltic states and, if the war in Yugoslavia comes to an end, maybe
Croatia.'
This week, Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, perhaps with an eye
on next spring's presidential election in France, gave an indication of his
country's position on future patterns of European integration.
In his view, Europe could organise along the lines of three concentric
circles. France and Germany would head an inner core; other EU members
wishing to travel more slowly could join a second circle; while the east
Europeans would be consigned to an outer ring reflecting their backward
economies. Crucially, Mr Balladur avoided naming which countries would form
the hard core, or how his version of 'variable geometry' would operate in
practice.
In fact, 'variable geometry' is a highly complex subject upon which the best
technocratic and legal minds in Europe have only just started to reflect.
The German plan for an inner core, Mr Balladur's remarks and Mr Major's
speech yesterday all offered different patterns of integration. The
difficulty is that variable geometry can mean different things. In rough
terms, there are three options:
Variable speed Europe. Most experts argue that there is nothing wrong with
countries moving at a different pace towards common objectives. Britain was
involved in the creation of the European Monetary System, but only joined
the European exchange rate mechanism several years later. Similarly, less
developed economies such as Greece and Portugal are allowed 'derogations' or
transition periods for single market legislation in banking and insurance.
Europe a la carte. The consensus is that complete freedom of choice to
accept or reject core obligations, such as the common agricultural policy or
a common competition policy, would undermine the Union beyond repair. It
would conflict with the treaty of Rome, unravel the single European market,
and destroy the single institutional framework embracing the European
Commission, the European Court and the Council of Ministers.
Variable geometry. This option lies somewhere between the two above options.
It would acknowledge that some member states have different interests, but
flexibility would have limits. Variable geometry would be subject to
agreement by all other member states.
In practice, variable geometry already exists. Britain does not take part in
the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty. Denmark has special protection
against foreigners buying second homes. Ireland is not a member of the West
European Union, the EU's emerging defence arm. France is a member of Nato,
but is not a member of the alliance's integrated command.
The challenge is how to apply variable geometry in an expanded Union, and
how to adapt it to deal with the economic and budgetary problems posed by
the entry of the east Europeans. 'The paradox is between what you want
politically on the one hand, and what is mathematically sustainable on the
other,' says Mr Hans Van den Broek, EU commissioner for external political
affairs.
The attractions of variable geometry are immense: able and willing states
could press ahead according to their own pace, while others would retain the
freedom to stay behind or catch up later. It could also allow the east
Europeans generous transition periods in which to prepare for full EU
membership. Yet the risks are also considerable if the variable geometry
grants too much latitude.
A senior EU official points out Britain may not subscribe to the social
chapter, but it is bound by social policy provisions in successive European
treaties: 'The social protocol (in Maastricht) is only a small part of the
whole.'
Similarly, there are big risks in allowing member states to opt out of EU
decisions. Under a 1971 European Court ruling, where the Union has been
given 'competence', or responsibility, in areas covering the internal
market, it extends automatically to international negotiations. Hence a
decision to allow 10 members of a 25-member Union to opt out of legislation
covering air quality would create a legal and political minefield. 'The
Japanese and Americans would rightly ask who the EU was representing,' says
one legal official.
The issue of whether the EU - through the Commission - has a distinct legal
personality in matters such as trade has led to friction with France.
Arguments over individual rights and collective responsibilities are equally
important in the area of foreign and security policy, where full freedom to
oppose decisions would paralyse the Union.
Many observers believe that the answer to these conundrums lies in
constructing a minimum set of rules and obligations to which all member
states could subscribe, perhaps in a new Euro-constitution. Franco-German
thinking appears to be proceeding on these lines, coupled with a stricter
definition of Union-wide competences and matters reserved for the nation
states.
Yet all these attempts to resolve disputes over the shape of Europe ignore
the present political constraints on member states and the fragile state of
public opinion. Moreover, the bargains necessary for a comprehensive
agreement have barely been identified, let alone negotiated among the
existing and future member states.
Thus France has yet to signal the degree to which it will commit itself to
political union in return for the prize of a single European currency.
Despite Mr Major's speech yesterday, Britain has yet to reveal how it
reconciles claims to be at the heart of Europe with its opt-out of European
monetary union and non-participation in other areas.
Perhaps the most promising area is defence, where tight budget constraints
and the US administration's active support for a new European force
operating under the Nato umbrella may succeed in accelerating agreement in
1996.
But many diplomats in Brussels suspect that the temptation will be to defer
tough choices, even if the price is a delay in EU membership for the eastern
Europeans. What is clear is that the past few days have witnessed the start
of a constitutional debate on the future of Europe. Nobody can stop it.

When Michael Heseltine unfolded his notion of the new 'linear city' to the
east of London in 1991, he picked the decidedly unpromising tag of East
Thames Corridor for the project. So what can we expect from the rechristened
Thames Gateway?
Environment minister David Curry was claiming credit for the new moniker
when he launched an action plan for the area yesterday. East Thames Corridor
had sounded a bit 'Kafkaesque', he said, and, rather than spend years
agonising over a new name or running competitions to choose one, he simply
'sat down and made the decision'.
Good to see a minister willing to make a tough call. But what a pity that
the same spirit of determination does not extend to the corridor itself.
Yesterday's plan had no new proposals and no new money to offer. At this
rate, Thames Gateway will be more of a linear village than a city.

TJ Rodgers, chief executive of Cypress Semiconductor, a Silicon Valley
chip-maker, was once a rather odd fish in the arcane world of the US
semiconductor industry. While most US chip producers rush for the trough as
soon as they sniff government money, Rodgers has often bitterly attacked
such subsidies.
He once laid into Sematech, a government-industry semiconductor research and
development consortium formed in 1987. Sematech gets half its loot from the
Defence Department, the rest from member companies. Rodgers saw Sematech as
nothing more than a hand-out for those chip industry fat cats not up to
fighting international competition.
Times change. Now Cypress Semiconductor says it's taking a Dollars 500,000
grant from Minnesota's Department of Trade and Economic Development toward
the cost of building what the company describes as 'one of the most advanced
semiconductor manufacturing facilities in the world'. Then again, perhaps
it's a virtual reality plant that doesn't actually exist.

Russians seem to have a sweet tooth - and are willing to pay for it. In
return for the 200 tonnes of Cadbury's chocolate fingers Hillsdown Holdings
sold to Russia this year it has received hard cash. No bartering, and
absolutely no attempt to pay for the nibbles in plutonium. But, says chief
executive David Newton, finance director Raymond Mackie has been known to
light up in the dark. . .

Alastair Campbell, the journalist recruited by Labour leader Tony Blair as
his personal press spokesman, is clearly not a man to pull his punches.
The 37-year-old Cambridge graduate, most recently assistant editor on Rupert
Murdoch's left-leaning Today newspaper, is fondly remembered by fellow hacks
chiefly for his showdown with Michael White, the Guardian's political
editor, just after the maritime disappearance of Robert Maxwell. The amiable
White was musing upon the fate of 'Captain Bob, bob, bob, bob . . .'.
Campbell, then political editor of the Daily Mirror, leapt to the defence of
his deceased proprietor, and there followed a spirited physical exchange.
Enter the intrepid David Hill, Labour's chief spin doctor, who broke up the
warring factions.
But Campbell obviously made an impression. No doubt he and Hill are now in
search of subtler ways to put across their views.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Leading Article: John Major's Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The British prime minister has lost no time in responding to the challenge
implicitly thrown out last week by his French and German partners when they
outlined their separate, but overlapping, visions of the future development
of the European Union. In his speech at Leiden yesterday, Mr Major welcomed
'their emphasis on a more flexible Europe'. Recalling his own preference for
a multi-speed Europe in which some states 'should integrate more closely or
more quickly in certain areas' than others, he nonetheless insisted that
such development must be acceptable to all member states, and that 'no
member state should be excluded from an area of policy in which it wants and
is qualified to participate'.
The French and German proposals have thus had the merit of obliging Britain
to clarify its views. Mr Major named three areas 'where conformity is right
and necessary', which apparently means that there must be no opt-outs. These
areas are international trade, the single market and - perhaps more
surprisingly, but logically - the environment. (He should probably have
added immigration, but this is an area the British government has not yet
clearly thought through.)
Everything else, in Mr Major's vision, is a la carte. He claims a leading
role for Britain in foreign policy and defence, while recalling that, on
stage three of economic and monetary union, 'I have thought it right to
reserve the United Kingdom's position, and still do'. Clearly what causes
him anxiety is the attempt by the German Christian Democrats, and perhaps
also (though this is less clear) by the French prime minister, to define a
'hard core' of leading member states, for which full membership of Emu would
be an essential qualification.
That would indeed be matter for concern if the proposal were to exclude
non-members of Emu from participating in such things as the common foreign
policy or common defence. But no one has actually proposed that. The CDU
proposal is almost as much analytical as prescriptive: it says that
leadership in the EU must come from a hard core of countries which
'participate as a matter of course in all policy fields, but should also be
recognisably more community-spirited in their joint action than others'. The
CDU thinks that core will initially consist of only five countries, but
'must be open to every member state willing and able to meet its
requirements' and must indeed seek actively to involve other member states
more closely.
The only point on which it clearly differs from Mr Major is in refusing to
allow him a veto on the efforts of other countries to move ahead in areas
for which Britain is not ready. Britain's pretention to such a veto must in
the long run be politically unsustainable. For the rest, Britain will no
doubt retain the right to opt out of Emu and other aspects of the EU that it
does not like. But the more it exercises that right, the more it will
exclude itself from the EU's central leadership.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Trade embargoes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The ending of Malaysia's seven-month ban on public contracts for British
companies is probably as much a cause of relief in Kuala Lumpur as in
London. The dispute had become an embarrassing headache in both capitals.
But while the two sides now seek to restore normal relations, they and other
countries should reflect on the wider lessons of this dispute, which
underlines the dangers that arise when trade is held hostage to political
objectives.
Neither side can take much pride in its conduct. The ban, in response to UK
newspaper reports that a British company had tried to bribe Malaysian
politicians, was misjudged and out of proportion. If Malaysia's real target
was the British press, as it claimed, it should have sought redress through
Britain's courts. It should also have been encouraged to do so by the UK
government and affected companies. To their discredit, some British
politicians and businessmen seemed keener to appease Kuala Lumpur, by
calling into question the principle of press freedom.
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, will doubtless argue that he
has lifted the ban because he has made his point. As likely, however, is
that it had become counter-productive. Dr Mahathir has ambitious plans for
Malaysia to become an industrialised country by 2020. If it is to do so, it
will need to continue attracting the inflows of foreign private capital and
technology that have fuelled much of its rapid development to date. The
trade ban hardly sent a reassuring message to prospective international
investors, who have plenty of alternative destinations.
Malaysia is far from alone in trying to use trade - or unilateral threats to
disrupt it - as a political lever. The US has also sought to do so, when
pressing China and Indonesia to improve their human rights records. The
Clinton administration also faces domestic pressure to discriminate against
imports from countries that do not respect US environmental rules.
Such tactics, even when well-intentioned, amount to an attempt by one
country to impose its values and standards on others, by force. There is
also little evidence that they achieve their objectives. Indeed, in an ever
more interdependent world economy, they risk rebounding swiftly on their
proponents. Witness Washington's retreat from threats to deprive Beijing of
most favoured nation trade status, under pressure from warnings by US
companies that such action would jeopardise their efforts to expand business
in China.
The advance of global economic integration is bound to make the disparities
between countries' cultural, political and social values more salient. To
cope with the friction, what will be needed is increased efforts to accept
those differences and, where necessary, negotiate constructively upon them.
Aggressive unilateral trade actions are the wrong response.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Sauce of inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID LEVAGGI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Recent Royal Mint adverts reminding punters that the anniversary Pounds
2 coin issue will cease at the end of September prompts the suggestion that
the issue of a permanent Pounds 2 piece is long overdue. On the other side
of the Channel, French FFr20 and German DM5 coins have been in circulation
for more than two years.
Bottom-line inflation may be 'only' 2.5 per cent, but Pounds 1 is now a
paltry sum compared with its purchasing power when sterling was first
decimalised in 1971. Then, many urged a basic unit based on 10 old
shillings, complaining that a Pounds 1 unit was too large.
There are still those who complain of the non-availability of a Pounds 1
note south of the border (Hadrian's Wall not the Rio Grande). This is
notwithstanding that it will not even buy two units of my regular measure of
inflation - a 228g bottle of HP Sauce which remains unaltered in size, shape
and nature of contents since the end of the first world war. What cost 4d
(Pounds 0.0167) in 1934 now retails, 60 years on, for about Pounds 0.58, a
35 times price increase, approximately.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Danger in making premature judgments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir JOHN BANHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The logic of your recent editorial ('England's local shambles', August
25) fell below the levels that your readers have come to expect.
First, you assume what you set out to prove: that the Local Government
Commission will produce unnecessary structural change, while ignoring the
advantages of a more pragmatic approach and of improvements to the existing
two-tier system. You would be wise to wait before rushing to premature
judgments. The commission is well aware of all the risks you mentioned;
indeed, we have alerted you to many of them.
Second, the changes of which you evidently approve - to correct the mistakes
made in 1974 - will only be possible with the kind of independent but local
consideration that the review is able to provide. How otherwise can
Parliament sensibly identify the 'handful of large cities' to become unitary
authorities, and those 'counties . . . enjoying little local loyalty' which,
presumably, you would like to see abolished.
Finally, you take us to task for implementing one of only two reforms that
you believe necessary to enhance local democracy, the use of advisory local
referendums to give electors a direct say on local matters of concern to
them. This is precisely what the Local Government Commission is now doing
throughout shire England, as we consult local people on the appropriate
structure for their local government and to which there has been a
magnificent and unprecedented response.
Of course, there are risks involved in the Local Government Review - just as
there are in the alternative approach that has been adopted in Scotland and
Wales. Managing them is not made easier by premature editorials riddled with
fallacies.

Sir, With reference to your article, 'DTI rejects Labour plea' (September
7), one wonders whether the Department of Trade and Industry is the best
forum to investigate cases such as Lord Archer's Anglia Television share
dealings. Consideration should be given to whether an independent body, such
as the Institute of Business Ethics, comprising well-known people with
practical experience, would not deal more competently and speedily with
these matters. It is unlikely they would need five months to decide no
further action should be taken.
The Institute of Business Ethics has recently issued a code of conduct,
which should be universally adopted.

REFERENDUMS AROUND THE WORLD: THE GROWING USE OF DIRECT DEMOCRACY Edited by
David Butler and Austin Ranney
AEI Press, Dollars 19.95, 304 pages
Democracy is always evolving. Now, just as its triumph over totalitarian
ideologies appears as-sured, representative government - the goal of western
democrats since the American and French revolutions  - is under challenge
from a different quarter.
The call for change comes from those who can be described as 'direct
democrats'. Dissatisfied with the limitations of representative democracy,
they want to give ordinary citizens an active role in government. Their main
demand is wider use of referendums - something on which they are making
significant headway. Theirs is a fraught struggle - and is bound to be so
since they confront one of the world's most entrenched vested interests: the
class of professional politicians.
This excellent study is both a catalogue of, and a commentary on,
referendums across the world since the French Revolution. Nearly 800
national referendums are listed. While no decade before the 1970s records
more than 80 referendums, there were 177 in the 1970s and 153 in the 1980s,
about half in bona fide democracies. The tally for the 1990s looks set to
exceed 200.
David Butler and Austin Ranney's catalogue includes most modern
dictatorships - a reminder that referendums can also be a handy aid to
dictators.
But referendums have played key roles in transitions to democracy. Like
elections and bills of rights, however, the democratic credibility of a
referendum is only ever as strong as a community's political conscience and
culture (and dictators) permit.
For mature democracies, the key issue is whether referendums can deepen
democracy by generating informed public debate on policy questions, and not
just prejudice manipulated by demagogues or the media.
The experience of Switzerland is critical to any assessment because that
country has held more referendums than all other nations combined. With 6.5m
citizens, and a regime which since 1848 has proved more durable, democratic
and prosperous than virtually any other, its example may offer important
lessons for other democracies.
In addition to mandatory referendums on constitutional changes, 100,000
Swiss citizens can oblige the state, by means of an 'initiative', to hold
referendums on laws passed by parliament or on proposed constitutional
reforms of their own devising. The Swiss typically vote on six to 12
national questions a year, spread over two to four separate ballots. Four
striking conclusions emerge from the chapter by Kris Kobach, a former Oxford
University doctoral student: Switzerland's representative institutions are
not rendered irrelevant by the referendum process. Rather, parliament and
the government are guaranteed a significant constitutional role, with power
to make counter-proposals and to delay polls. Popular votes generally
support earlier parliamentary decisions. But the prospect of a referendum on
an issue, and the need to carry majorities in more than half the 23 cantons
for constitutional changes, weighs on ministers and MPs.
The referendum in Switzerland has in effect taken the role played by the
opposition in other western democracies. Since 1959, the Swiss government
has been a permanent cross-communal coalition of four largest parties,
obliged to conduct a continual dialogue with citizens.
Although most 'initiatives' are defeated, they are still influential. Kobach
cites the 1989 'initiative' proposing to abolish the Swiss army. It was
defeated. But the 36 per cent vote in favour exceeded expectations,
prompting cuts in the size of the army, a relaxation of military service and
a civilian option for men (a proposal rejected in a 1984 referendum).
In Switzerland, then, referendums go hand in hand with federalism and a
consensual approach to government. That means the Swiss model cannot simply
be transplanted into different traditions.
Ireland is a case in point. In his chapter, Vernon Bogdanor, reader in
politics at Oxford University, argues that the republic abolished its
variant of 'the initiative' in 1937 partly, it seems, for fear that it could
result in the tyranny of the majority.
On the same grounds, one could argue, a referendum process is unlikely to
help secure lasting peace in Northern Ireland. Much would depend on the
definitions of electorates and guarantees for Catholic and Protestant
communities, each of which fears persecution by the other. If an Irish
federation combining the republic and Northern Ireland ever emerged,
localised referendums could help provide legitimacy.
Bogdanor also discusses what lies behind the increasing resort to direct
democracy in western Europe. He argues the rise of representative government
in the late 19th century was accompanied by the rise of mass political
parties. Dominated by professional politicians reliant on office for status
and income, the parties halted movement towards direct forms of democracy.
Voters accepted this, believing their interests depended on 'their' party's
triumph.
Now, however, ever fewer voters in the west identify with a single party,
while ever more are suspicious of politicians. It is no accident that Italy,
whose party system generated patronage and corruption on a massive scale, is
the European country to witness the most dramatic increase in the use of the
referendum in the past decade.
A century ago AV Dicey, the English constitutionalist, predicted that, 'once
established, the referendum would never be got rid of by anything short of a
revolution'. He may be right but, in Britain and perhaps elsewhere,
political revolutions may be needed to make it an integral part of
government in the first place.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Apec can be a force for global free
trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr C FRED BERGSTEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, My colleagues on the Apec Eminent Persons Group and I appreciate your
thoughtful comments ('Seeking a role for Apec', September 2) on the new
report, Achieving the Apec Vision: Free and Open Trade in the Asia Pacific,
which we recently submitted to the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec)
forum. We would offer four comments in response.
First, you ask whether the extensive dependence of most Apec members on the
US market is a sufficient basis for regional trade liberalisation. There are
certainly other bases: the large potential gains from eliminating the
substantial barriers that still dot the region; concerns about the
weaknesses of the global trading system and inward-looking regionalism in
other parts of the world; the security interdependence across the Pacific
and the American interest in the dynamic growth of Asia. But the members'
desire to maintain their trade access to the US propels them to-wards new
liberalisation initiatives because trade policy clearly slides backward
towards protectionism in the absence of steady forward momentum.
Second, you note the presence of important trade disputes among the members
of Apec. The need to address such conflicts more effectively is in fact one
of our main reasons for recommending prompt adoption of a comprehensive
regional trade programme, including the creation of a dispute mediation
service to help resolve the disputes directly. We would hope that such a
programme would inter alia induce the US to redirect at least some of its
negotiating efforts into regional channels, and it is noteworthy that the US
government has announced publicly that it will not be raising labour and
environmental issues in Apec.
Third, we are confident that Apec will respond positively to your query over
whether its regional efforts will support the global trading system. Leading
European trade negotiators have testified that last year's Apec summit in
Seattle was a significant, perhaps the significant, turning point in
bringing the Uruguay Round to a successful conclusion.
Your concern that Apec would hurt the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
by diverting negotiating resources is belied by the nearly simultaneous
achievements of the Uruguay Round and three regional agreements - Europe
1992, Nafta and the Asean Free Trade Agreement. The global trading interests
of all Apec members assure that they will do whatever is necessary to
implement the Uruguay Round and strengthen the Gatt. Every proposal in our
EPG Report either conforms fully to Gatt or goes beyond it to create new
'Gatt-plus' arrangements.
Our group indeed believes that Apec can become a leading force for global
trade progress.
We look forward to further dialogue during the run-up to the Apec summit
that will address these issues in Indonesia on November 15.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Good news is not always bad news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the paradoxical aspects of current economic discussion is the way
that good news is presented as bad. If output rises more quickly then
expected or unemployment falls faster, many market commentators treat it as
bad news. The reasoning is that central banks will fear 'overheating', and
will be more likely, in the case of the US and Britain, to raise short-term
rates or - in the case of Germany - less likely to cut them.
A few dissenting economists have always suspected that the mainstream
discussion was wrong and the instinctive public reaction correct. For
instance, the American 'new classical' economist, Robert Barro, has chided
the Federal Reserve for worrying about growth being too fast in its public
presentations of interest rate policy.
The issue is particularly relevant in the UK the day after chancellor
Kenneth Clarke's monthly meeting with Eddie George, governor of the Bank of
England. In spite of a standstill in the housing market and a downward blip
in consumer credit, the overall movement of the economy suggests that output
is rising faster than forecasters expected. Goldman Sachs makes a plausible
case that real gross domestic product outside the oil sector is likely to
rise by 3 per cent this year and 4 per cent in 1995.
The conclusion of the investment firm is that 'without higher interest rates
there is a considerable risk of the economy growing much too fast for
comfort'. There is a good chance that the Bank will express, and the
chancellor accept, such a view, if not this month, then next month or soon
after. Moreover, Goldman Sachs persists in its call for higher interest
rates even though underlying inflation is at a 27-year low and well below
the Treasury's 'optimistic' summer forecast. The Goldman economists persist
in spite of their own statement that the composition of the recovery is
changing in favour of exports (10 per cent up in volume on a year ago) and
investment (6 1/2 per cent up), and despite their more optimistic assessment
both of the current balance of payments and of the government's borrowing
requirement.
Obviously, there can be too much of anything. But the inflationary danger
comes not from too much output or too much employment, but from too much
expenditure. Indeed, to the extent that output rises to meet an increase in
spending the inflationary danger is mitigated.
The object of policy should surely be to encourage a rise of expenditure in
cash terms fast enough to support growth but not so high to finance an
inflationary take-off. In current circumstances this would be about 5-6 per
cent a year, not only in the UK, but also in many other western countries.
However, the precise breakdown of demand growth in any particular year
between greater output and higher prices depends on the actions of
businessmen, trade unionists and other agents  - as well as outside shocks
and world events - and is not under the control of policymakers.
The current orthodoxy is not nonsense. The general idea is that future
inflation depends both on the gap between actual and capacity output and the
speed with which that gap is being reduced. The capacity gap is a useful aid
to thought and I have used it in these columns in spite of sarcastic notes
from former finance ministers. But to use it directly for setting policy
presupposes a good idea of the trend growth of capacity, the present margin
of unused capacity and the size of the capacity gap required to prevent
inflation accelerating. It also depends on having a good idea of the likely
growth of output under unchanged policy. It is idle pretence to suppose this
knowledge exists.
The two years ahead, on which the Bank claims to take a view, are not nearly
far enough for its present approach. For the main question about current
trends is not whether they may lead to a temporary inflation peak of 4 per
cent in 1996 - with which we could live - but a cumulative pressure on
resources which will lead to ever rising inflation in subsequent years. It
may be that because of supply-side improvements, the UK economy could
sustain 4 per cent growth for several years ahead. On the other hand even 3
per cent growth may be too high.
Goldman Sachs makes a brave attempt to bypass these imponderables with two
sets of leading indicators, which have had an empirical relation to
inflationary turning points. The shorter indicator contains only three items
 -import prices, earnings and gilt-edged yields. This indicator gives a lead
averaging six months, but it gave scant warning of the inflationary
pressures of the late 1980s and its recent upturn is minuscule.
The longer indicator contains 11 variables, ranging from monetary aggregates
and house prices to industrial production and skilled labour shortages. The
lead time here has averaged 20 months, but varied from 5 to 44. It has been
rising, although not strongly, for 36 months. Such an index is a useful
supplement to a conventional forecast, as are the bond market's inflation
expectations. But all three signals together still leave 75 per cent of the
decision to hunch, judgment and fashion.
My own often-stated preference is an objective for total national
expenditure of which the headline measure is Nominal GDP and which can be
popularised as a national cash objective. It has the great advantage of not
pretending that monetary policy influences only inflation, and its pursuit
would provide a safeguard against the kind of collapse of spending which
took place in the 1930s Depression. A nominal demand objective would also
provide some reassurance against fears - recently voiced by Jacques Delors -
that downward pay flexibility would defeat itself by reducing demand for
products and labour.
Indeed the Bank's economic director Mervyn King went part of the way, in a
little-noticed section of his 1994 Institute of Fiscal Studies Lecture, to
argue that by making use of the full range of the 1 1/2 -4 per cent official
inflation target, something approaching the aims of a Nominal GDP objective
might be fulfilled.
But quite apart from the question of whether that speech is official policy,
it does not go far enough. For it still depends on what economists call a
well-determined short-term Philips curve - that is, an idea of the level of
activity which would go with any given rate of inflation.
Many of the objections to a nominal demand objective misunderstand the
proposal as one for short-term fine-tuning. That is why critics put so much
emphasis on delays and revisions to the quarterly GDP data. In fact the
intention is to influence the trend of spending rather than to hit a precise
quarterly or even yearly path. If the idea were ever taken seriously it
would probably be best to concentrate not on the exact measure known as
Nominal GDP but on some alternative such as domestic expenditure at factor
cost.
The chart shows how this measure explains, more convincingly than any other
kind of analysis, the effects of the credit boom of the 1980s. The rise in
underlying inflation was not that great, but inflationary spending was
diverted into imports, which provided a safety valve while policy was being
tightened.
The outstanding advantage of a nominal demand objective in present
circumstances is that it would reduce reliance on forecasts. If a set of
leading indicators could be developed for nominal expenditure so much the
better. But it would not be disastrous to rely on what is actually
happening. A slump would soon show itself in the growth of nominal
expenditure falling below a 5-6 per cent objective, as it did in 1991-92.
Overheating would show itself in expenditure rising persistently above it.
The ride would not be smooth, but it will not be anyway.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Arts: ENO looks to Lottery for cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday English National Opera announced rebuilding plans for its Coliseum
home. In other words it launched its bid for Lottery cash.
The ENO is looking for between Pounds 40m and Pounds 45m to modernise one of
architect Frank Matcham's grandest and most ornate Edwardian theatrical
extravaganzas. The sum is much higher than anticipated, but Shaun Woodward,
best known as a former director of communications at the Conservative Party,
who is leading the appeal, has based his estimates on 1998 building costs.
The money will go towards a smarter front-of-house, a regilded auditorium,
and more civilised backstage facilities, plus such money-making propositions
as a glassed-over roof-top restaurant overlooking Trafalgar Square.
An anoynmous friend of the ENO has already pledged Pounds 1m and there is
another Pounds 250,000 in the bag. Woodward will go for both Arts Council
and Heritage Fund Lottery money. Contacts should help: he knows well Peter
Gummer, who chairs the Arts Council's Lottery division.
But to be certain of Lottery support against frantic opposition, Woodward
knows he must make a strong case for the ENO. He is pushing its mass appeal
and high standards. 'If this place closed, the wider opera audience would
have nowhere else to go.'
To underpin the bid, general director Dennis Marks has already announced a
1994-95 programme which combines new productions of popular favourites, such
as Tosca, with operas likely to appeal to enthusiasts, such as Khovanshchina
and The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahaganny.
In his first year, Marks has raised attendances by 2 per cent, to a still
worryingly low 62 per cent of capacity, but subscriptions are up 30 per cent
and plans to introduce new productions of Turandot, Fidelio and a Jonathan
Miller Carmen should see the box office take improving at the same time that
Woodward woos corporate and private friends, and the Lottery providers.
Woodward knows that the ENO must raise at least a third, say Pounds 15m, of
its target from its own resources. He hopes to sell the ENO to companies as
the opera house for their workforces rather than for their boards. If all
goes well the ENO will close for its facelift in mid-1998 and re-open on New
Year's eve 1999.
The Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, also plans to be closed at this time
for its refurbishment, which equally depends on Lottery funding. Its appeal,
for around Pounds 100m, will probably be launched next year.
On Tuesday another celebrated London arts venue announced its application
for Lottery aid. The Riverside Studios, alongside the Thames at Hammersmith,
is looking for Pounds 3.3m for a complete overhaul and to pay off debts. The
debts, Pounds 300,000, are the most worrying. Unless the money is found by
the end of March, new director Bill Burdett-Coutts' efforts to make the
Riverside matter again will be doomed.
He is already finding it a challenge: the local authority has rejected his
plan to moor a ferry by the Studios as a new performing space and restaurant
on the grounds that it will disturb the ducks. A strong programme opens this
week with new plays by Berkoff and continues with a London Comedy Festival.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Arts: Design for Living - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY

<TEXT>
Some of Noel Coward's comedies succeed because they very shrewdly tell the
truth, but others are merely enchanting lies. About such matters as bad
manners, the dangers of charm, and offstage theatricality Coward knew
plenty: witness the spot-on brilliance of Hay Fever and Present Laughter.
About such matters as sustained sexual passion and responsibilities within
adult relationships he knew far less: witness such delicious fibs as Private
Lives.
Design for Living is a pretty fib about something Coward did not understand
at all: bisexuality. But people have been lying about bisexuality for
decades, and Coward's charming games with it are only seriously marred by
his terror of calling a spade a spade and by his final pretence that a
sexual threesome can be a good permanent arrangement. Sean Mathias's new
production is, however, happy to fill in, in 1994, what Coward left out in
1933, and to tear away some of what Coward needed to add. His staging is
sometimes much more than delicious, and to that extent it is on the verge of
being the most important production of a Coward play London has seen in many
years.
Design for Living is, you will recall, about the erotic triangle of Gilda,
Otto, and Leo. Mathias's most audacious stroke is to tear it away from its
original 1930s setting. This, at first, strips off that bright-young-thing
polish that makes most Coward plays sound like make-believe. Mathias is
strong on the sex between the three central characters, and thrillingly
reveals the two elements of sexual passion about which Coward knew most:
owning up to sexual attraction and sexual jealousy. He makes these gripping
to us - much of the time - because he has the actors speak the dialogue -
much of the time - with all the speed and attack that Coward's lines call
for, and because - much of the time - they eliminate the airily glamorous
artifice that is usually an adjunct of Coward's style.
The production begins with Gilda (Rachel Weisz) opening the fridge and
soothing her inflamed body after a night of impassioned sex. Everything  -
the way her body radiates sexual excitement through its gorgeous and thin
little shift, the sultry muzak in the air, the scatter cushions on the floor
 -plunges the play straightaway into the world we know. And the modern
effect is thrilling throughout the first act, even though this is the play's
least amusing. Thereafter, however, the production occasionally loses its
nerve. Even Stephen Brimson Lewis's vivid designs stop being so 'now' and
becomes more ambivalent.
Rachel Weisz, the least experienced of the three players, gives far the most
revelatory performance. No Cowardly world-weariness here. The way she plays
Act One, as if still high on last night, is marvellous. She is all reckless
self-discovery, and she embodies the dilemma of the modern woman: how to
have it all? She wants sex and intimacy and independence; she is sexual and
sophisticated but without a jot of calculation; she is endlessly
spontaneous. There is a bubble of doll's-house hysteria beneath everything
she does that makes her much the most interesting character in the play.
Clive Owen's Otto is even more radically conceived: no kind of upper-class
accent whatever here. This does not always work; the words 'my dearest dear'
do not come naturally from his lips. In general, however, he goes for Otto's
honesty. And his blend of roughness and tenderness make his bisexuality
persuasive; we can even believe, sometimes at least, that he wants Gilda to
realise herself as a woman and not just as his lover.
Paul Rhys, as Leo, starts with terrific freshness, and, like Weisz, he has
the kind of good looks that make sense (sexually speaking) of the story.
But, alas, he soon opts for the customarily artificial way of playing
Coward: the more-clipped-than-thou vowels, the pretty-boy tricks of the
eyes, the cultivated aloof facade.
The artificial way of playing Coward can, of course, be wonderfully funny.
When Rhys says 'You've been to Chuquicamata, I suppose?', he is uproarious.
But by this point the play has retreated into never-never-land.
We may believe that Gilda can tumble back into bed with her old boyfriends,
but not that this Gilda should want to stay there. The play's final scene
is, eventually, one big lie.

For some reason Radio Times describes Waiting For God, which begins a new
run today, as 'gentle'. It is anything but gentle. Vigorous to the point of
violence in its dialogue, it is in several ways better than that other
retirement comedy, 'One Foot In The Grave'. Waiting For God has a powerful
central duo in Graham Crowden and Stephanie Cole, as inhabitants of the
Bayview Retirement Home, and then two sources of strong ensemble acting: the
other inmates and staff of the home, and the ghastly younger members of the
family (8.30 BBC1). After the news, BBC1 begins a fresh batch of another
comedy: Chef] with Lenny Henry as the neurotic and hysterical cook (9.30).
With the UN conference on population and development in Cairo this week, C4
screens a 60-minute documentary called Sex, Sin And Survival which tries to
establish whether the growth in global population is really a time bomb
threatening human existence (9.00). The last programme in BBC2's Hamar
Trilogy about women in south-west Ethiopia is the first new one. It is now
three years since Duka left home to marry a man she had never met (9.30).

WYATT EARP (12) Lawrence Kasdan
MR JONES (15) Mike Figgis
COLOR OF NIGHT Richard Rush
WRESTLING ERNEST HEMINGWAY (12) Randa Haines
DARKNESS IN TALLINN Ilkka Jarvilaturi
A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH (U) Powell and Pressburger
It is easy to see why Lawrence Kasdan's sprawling biopic Wyatt Earp runs for
nearly twice as long as most other features - it wants to be two very
different films. The first is a standard Western, complete with elegiac
vistas of blood-red sunsets, free-swinging bar-room brawls, good-hearted
whores and laconic heroes with droopy moustaches. The second film,
meanwhile, is a wayward effort to demythologise the gunslinger icon along
the lines of Clint Eastwood's masterful Unforgiven. Not surprisingly, these
two antagonistic strands tend to cancel each other out, making for a
distinctly unaffecting exercise in film-making.
This problem is crystallised in Kevin Costner's performance as Earp. Even
after more than three hours in his company it is still hard to know what to
make of the man. Is he a brutalising bully who hides behind a sheriff's
badge and stoical cowboy code? Or is he the wise and strong patriarch of the
Earp clan, reluctantly employing violence to protect his kin? Or simply a
very human mixture of both? Neither Kasdan nor Costner are able to provide
the answer to these questions, leaving a big empty at the film's core that
all the action and scenery in the world cannot fill.
That said, Kasdan keeps things moving at a good pace, taking the viewer
through the story's inordinate span with relative ease. Owen Roizman's
photography looks great, and the shoot-out at the OK Corral is wonderfully
understated, with the two groups of combatants gunning at each other from
just a few feet away, most of their shots missing the mark. The best thing
about the film is Dennis Quaid's portrayal of Doc Holliday, an acerbic,
cynical turn that makes you wish Kasdan had stuck to his deconstructionist
guns instead of muffling them with all those lovely desert vistas and Calvin
Klein outerwear.
British director Mike Figgis's second American movie, Mr Jones, arrives on
his native shores surrounded by a cloud of Hollywood horror stories about
studio interference, including the classic about an executive who wanted the
depressive parts of the hero's manic-depression to be edited out, leaving
just the 'up' sequences. As it is, the film seems to have weathered these
crass assaults fairly well, making for a largely involving psychological
drama that only comes unstuck in the final reel.
In it, Richard Gere plays a gifted thirty-something who suffers from the
severe mood swings inherent in manic depression - at one moment he will be
charming everyone out of their socks; the next finds him muttering,
dishevelled and suicidal. It is easy to see why the Method-trained Gere
would opt for such a role, especially given Hollywood's recent proclivity
for awarding Oscars to actors who portray disabled characters. While his
performance certainly is not on that sort of level, Gere does have several
fine moments as he spars with shrinks, leaps on stage to conduct a symphony
orchestra and steals a kiss from a babe on the street. Lena Olin is his
match as the psychiatrist who forgets her Hippocratic oath as she falls in
love with her patient.
Where the film is less than convincing is in the deeper things it has to say
about Mr Jones's mental illness, which at times is presented as a curable
condition while at others depicted as the central part of a winning
personality which would be a shame to extinguish. One occasionally suspects
that the film-makers' primary interest might lie in the cinematic
possibilities of the disease's symptoms rather than in its true nature. This
is nowhere more apparent than in the absurdly rosy conclusion, which has
Olin abandoning her career to live with her uncured patient, as if love were
a clinically effective substitute for lithium.
Psychological disruptions are also the order of the day in Color of Night,
though they are just as likely to occur in unsuspecting audience members as
on screen. It has been 13 years since the American director Richard Rush
released his last film, the critically acclaimed and genuinely brilliant The
Stunt Man. It is the sort of hiatus that usually means the artist either has
a masterpiece up his sleeve or is suffering some sort of creative distress.
Unfortunately, Rush's new film indicates the latter. The woeful plot
involves Bruce Willis as a psychologist who takes over a murdered
colleague's therapy group in order to find out which of its members
committed the crime. Willis labours heroically to portray someone with a
sensitive nature and a three-figure IQ, but carries too much tough-guy
baggage to pull it off. By mid-film he seems positively relieved to be
involved in a monumental car chase. His love interest is portrayed by Jane
Marsh, who introduces herself to him as 'a struggling actress'. These prove
to be the film's truest lines.
Wrestling Ernest Hemingway is a pleasant, understated drama about two
elderly men striking up an unlikely friendship. Richard Harris plays a
75-year-old former sailor who finds himself washed up in a dingy Florida
town, abandoned by his yuppie children and spurned by landlady Shirley
MacLaine. All he has left are his memories (hence, the title) and his
burgeoning friendship with retired Cuban barber Robert Duvall.
The best thing about the film, not surprisingly, are the performances by the
two leads, particularly Duvall, whose musical Cuban accent never once
falters. Unfortunately, director Randa Haines has made the mistake of having
the film's pace match that of its heroes' lives, adding a half-hour to its
optimum length and creating an unnecessary sense of torpor.
Viewers not sufficiently motivated by the prospect of seeing a
Finnish-Estonian film should spare a second thought for Darkness in Tallinn,
which turns out to be a highly enjoyable caper flick that is only
incidentally set in the Baltics. In it, a group of marginally competent
criminals schemes to steal the entire gold supply of the fledgling Estonian
government by blackmailing a young electrician into turning off the entire
nation's power. The resulting mayhem involves as many shocks and twists as
the wiring of an old circuit box. Ilkka Jarvilaturi's direction of Paul
Kolsby's knowing script eschews gore and political commentary to create a
funny, well-paced thriller. A multi-million dollar Hollywood remake seems
all but inevitable.
Finally, this week sees the re-release of a cleaned-up print of Powell and
Pressburger's sublime A Matter of Life and Death. What is perhaps so
striking about viewing this 1946 masterwork amid the rest of the current
releases is to realise how daring and unfettered the filmmakers were 50
years ago, how alive they were to the possibilities of the medium. Despite
the occasionally quaint dialogue and even quainter wartime ethics, this
story of downed bomber pilot David Niven pleading his case before a
celestial court in order to stay on earth with lover, Kim Hunter, looks and
feels more giddily modern than most films being churned out nowadays.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Technology: Memory of shapes past - The potential of an
'intelligent' biocompatible alloy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MIRANDA EADIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nitinol, a biocompatible 'memory' alloy developed in the early 1960s and
recently further investigated for space applications, is showing potential
for use in minimally invasive surgery.
This 'intelligent material', composed of an almost 50:50 mixture of nickel
and titanium, has the capacity to memorise a particular shape. It expands or
contracts when heated and returns to its original shape when cooled. After
being deformed through bending, stretching and compression, it then needs
simply to be subjected to a predetermined temperature - in medical
applications, to that of the body.
Shape memory properties of certain materials were first discovered in the
1940s. Yet it was in 1962 that William Buehler, a materials researcher for
the US defence department, discovered those of nitinol. He used it for the
coupling of hydraulic pipes in jet aircraft, and this same system is still
used on the US F-16 fighter aircraft.
The other shape memory materials - copper, or polymer-based - have a more
limited usage than nitinol since they do not exhibit such a range of
movement and are not generally biocompatible. However, they are cheaper to
produce (about Pounds 100/kg as opposed to about Pounds 500/kg for nitinol).
A particularly elastic version of nitinol was the first to appear in a
medical application in the mid-1970s. It was used in dentistry to make
orthodontic bands to straighten teeth. The elasticity and shape memory
capacity of the material applies a constant tension on the teeth and avoids
the repeated visits to the dentist which are required to re-tighten the more
common stainless steel bands.
Another established application in medicine is for use as 'clot-catching'
filters in large blood vessels. Nitinol has also been used as urethral and
tracheal stents (mechanical devices which open out and reinstate the cross
section of fluid-carrying vessels).
It was not until the mid-1980s, however, that the full medical capacity of
nitinol began to be realised. Tony Anson, an engineer at the Brunel
Institute for Bioengineering in the UK, has played an instigating role. He
became familiar with nitinol while carrying out research for the European
Space Agency into its use for making 'linear actuators', or moving devices,
for Biosample, a space bioprocessing facility.
His work with nitinol brought him into contact with David Jenkins,
orthopaedic consultant at the Cardiff Royal Infirmary, who asked him to
investigate the material's potential in orthopaedic applications, in
particular for the correction of backbone deformity.
This research inspired a host of other potential uses for nitinol, including
bone repair staples and plates, soft tissue pins to repair torn ligaments,
vascular connection systems to join fluid-carrying vessels and other types
of stents for use in arteries and veins.
The use of nitinol for bone repair staples is in clinical trial at the
Cardiff Royal Infirmary and the results look positive, according to the
researchers. These staples were designed for non-complex long bone
fractures. However, researchers in the medical profession believe that by
changing the scale of the staples they could be used on any of the bones in
the body.
These staples are put into pre-drilled holes on either side of the fracture.
The heat of the body warms the staple, which then changes to its memorised
shape, pulling the bone ends together. A compressive setting of the bone at
the fracture site is achieved.
According to Anson: 'Such a treatment of broken bones may improve the
strength of the union, reduce the time taken to effect the repair by 25 per
cent, and is still one-third of the cost of presently available devices.'
Experimental work into the use of nitinol for vascular connection systems is
under way at the Brunel Institute for Bioengineering. 'The connection device
is essentially a hose clip,' explains Anson, 'and the whole connection
procedure takes no more than 30 seconds and is leak free.' This method of
joining blood vessels together could be advantageous in coronary bypass
operations where up to an hour is spent in suturing.
Sam Andrews of Charing Cross Hospital, London, is researching a minimally
invasive technique for repairing abdominal aortic aneurysms (swellings of
the main artery). Nitinol lends itself well to minimally invasive surgery
because it can be introduced into the body as a narrow wire and, once
inside, it can assume its memorised shape.
In this research, the nitinol is used as a stent to hold a fabric patch, or
dacron graft, in place. The dacron graft is wrapped around a nitinol wire
and fed into the aorta. When it is surrounded by blood, the nitinol warms up
and expands to reform its memorised shape stent.
Evidence shows that such stents hold grafts firmly in place and do not
migrate. Compared with traditional invasive surgery, the minimal access
operation involves only a tiny incision next to the patient's groin, instead
of a cut down the front of the body.
Nitinol also has non-medical uses in thermal control systems, for mounting
components in integrated circuits and as underwiring in brassieres. Typical
thermal control applications are found in kettle switches, on showers and
mixer taps (which switch off at a particular temperature to prevent
scalding), and on fire doors - such as those at York Minster (which close
when the temperature rises in the case of fire). In the latter case, it is
the strength of nitinol which is being exploited - a 3mm diameter nitinol
wire forming a spring of 2 1/2 cm diameter can move a force of 30kg.
The use of nitinol for mounting is exploited by the French company Souriau.
Its system, which avoids complicated soldering, uses split shape memory
sockets: these are wide open at low temperatures and close firmly around the
component parts at ambient temperature. Repair of such circuits is easy; it
is enough to cool the joints for the pieces to be taken apart.
Nitinol underwiring in bras is currently being commercialised by Japan's
Wacoal at its factories in the US, Asia, France and Belgium. In contrast to
traditional bras, Wacoal's do not lose their shape, even after repeated
machine washing.
The nitinol needs simply to be warmed by the body temperature for the
original preconfigured shape to be recovered. Over 3m Goodup bras, a popular
Wacoal model with nitinol underwiring, are sold in south-east Asia annually.
The bra is one of the biggest markets for nitinol at the moment, according
to Tony Michael, of Memory Metals, one of two companies in the UK that
market or process nitinol.
About 30 to 50 tonnes are produced annually for the global market by
Furakawa of Japan, and Raychem and Special Metal of the US.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Getting the measure
of PR - Claims that public relations cannot be evaluated are increasingly
questioned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Ever since public relations emerged as a discipline in its own right, the
industry has been struggling to prove its effectiveness and professionalism.
But attempts to evaluate PR are often hampered by the belief that its
methods are too subtle and results too intangible to be measured.
The view that PR was too 'creative and intuitive' to be evaluated was long
held by Shirley Horn, UK director of corporate communications at
Hewlett-Packard, the computer manufacturer. Until three years ago, the
nearest she came to measuring the effectiveness of her work was 'eyeballing
the size of the clippings binder'.
But in 1991 she was sent, under duress, on a three-day course about total
quality management. It convinced her that PR was a process that could be
evaluated like other disciplines.
'I emerged on a soapbox,' she says. 'Since then, we have been successfully
applying total quality management methodology to PR processes - documenting,
measuring and continuously improving the effectiveness of each process.' She
now measures everything from the correlation between coverage and the speed
of response to journalists' telephone calls, to the number of thank-you
letters written by dinner guests.
Horn's belief that PR can be usefully evaluated is increasingly widely
shared. 'This is the age of 'if you can't measure it, don't do it',' says
Sandra Macleod, managing director, Europe, of Carma International, a media
evaluation service. It is one of more than a dozen media evaluation services
recently established in the UK which quantify trends in media attitudes to
various issues and messages affecting a company.
Part of the value of media assessment to a PR department is that it helps
underpin the case for a particular budget.
Jane Drew, a public affairs manager at American Express, finds that using
the Carma evaluation system helps demonstrate to senior management the
effectiveness of PR campaigns. 'We find it useful because PR is not taken as
seriously as marketing or finance,' she says.
Evaluation reports can also suggest ways to improve a PR campaign. Bass, the
brewing company, uses the Impact system developed by Infopress, a PR
consultancy, to keep track of messages concerning matters such as quality,
innovation, tradition and management.
If the tracking studies show that a message such as 'Bass offers quality
brands' is being expressed less frequently in the press, the company will
try to remedy the trend by, say, making extra efforts to publicise awards
won by its beers, says Lesley Allman, external communications manager.
Evaluation reports may persuade companies to drop a campaign. For instance,
a drive by Philip Morris to counter criticism about the impact of tobacco on
health was found to be fruitless.
Other benefits of evaluation reports include identifying journalists who
have been particularly favourable or hostile towards a company. PR
departments may also be able to assuage the wrath of a chief executive
incensed by a negative article, by demonstrating that overall coverage of
the company is becoming more positive. Conversely, a critical press can
sometimes alert a company to an area of weak performance.
But not everyone believes that media evaluation techniques are a
satisfactory measure of PR's effectiveness. One inevitable problem is that
PR managers have no direct control over the results of their efforts in the
media. Moreover, it may be hard to disentangle the impact of a public
relations programme from that of other marketing exercises, such as direct
mail, promotions or sponsorship.
Another problem is that media response to a PR campaign is not the full
story. The ultimate purpose of most PR campaigns is to influence consumers,
or target groups such as shareholders or parliamentarians. The impact of the
campaign may need to be monitored by using survey research, setting up focus
groups, keeping track of share price movements and measuring sales.
PR evaluation also does not weigh success in limiting press criticism after
a damaging news story has emerged. Admittedly, companies that continually
attract negative comment can measure the performance of their PR departments
by keeping track of the volume of negative messages in the coverage. The
department can also measure its success in tempering the bad news with some
positive messages.
But most commentators agree that the greatest obstacle to PR evaluation is
cost. Although it may be reasonable to justify spending Pounds 10,000 to
evaluate the effectiveness of a PR budget of, say Pounds 250,000, the cost
of evaluation represents a large proportion of a small budget, unless
research is carried out in-house.
There is a distinct lack of enthusiasm on the part of PR consultancies and
their clients to find the extra cash to evaluate their campaigns. Quentin
Bell, president of the UK Public Relations Consultants Association, recently
dropped an attempt to introduce a standard evaluation tool for the PRCA's
members because of the lack of support for the move from clients and
consultancies.
Jon White, a visiting professor of public affairs at City University,
believes that the need of PR practitioners to evaluate activities is 'partly
a matter of professional insecurity'. He points out that PR is not alone in
experiencing difficulties with measurement and evaluation, which present
problems in all areas of management.
The point is echoed by Mike Beard, president of the Institute of Public
Relations, who argues that other disciplines such as finance, human
resources, law and marketing rarely have standard evaluation systems. 'Other
professions are not obsessed by the issue, nor should we be,' he says.
Yet the absence of an industry-wide measurement technique is regretted by
many people who believe that PR needs to improve its professionalism. 'It
would make the industry more quality-oriented if it allowed itself to be
subject to evaluation,' says Dermot McKeone, deputy chairman of Infopress.
Quentin Bell goes further. It is crucial that PR demonstrates its
effectiveness, he argues. 'Unless we can get clients to insist on
evaluation, there will not be a PR consultancy business in 25 years' time.'

Extending a product line, rather than launching a new brand, has the
attraction of offering quick rewards while minimising risk. The cost of
successfully launching a brand in the US, for example, is typically Dollars
30m (Pounds 19.3m) compared with Dollars 5m for a line extension.
But being swept along in 'line extension mania' can be dangerous.
In the latest issue of the Harvard Business Review* John Quelch, a Harvard
professor, and David Kenny, of consultancy Bain &amp; Co, identify pitfalls
which include:
Excessive segmentation and consumer confusion. If product lines are extended
without removing any existing items, the resulting clutter may drive
consumers to seek simple, all-purpose products.
Weakening brand loyalty. When a company extends its line, argue the authors,
'it risks disrupting the patterns and habits that underlie brand loyality
and reopening the entire purchase decision'. Customers may be encouraged to
switch brands.
Missing out on new brands. Some products currently marketed as extensions
could well have been launched as discrete brands. Long-term profits are
often sacrificed in favour of short-term risk management, say the authors.
No extension of demand. 'People do not eat or drink more, wash their hair
more, or brush their teeth more frequently simply because they have more
products from which to choose,' the authors say.
Other traps include damaging relations with retailers - the number of
packaged goods in the US grew 16 per cent each year from 1985 to 1992, while
retail shelf space expanded by only 1.5 per cent each year. Market share
gains from line extensions are also short-lived, as they can be copied
quickly by the competition.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Technology: Designing ways with electronics - A new
application that may transform an industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNA KOCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Etching technology is about to put new life into high-tech electronics
design which might otherwise reach its limits by the end of the century.
This is the view of Hewlett-Packard in Boblingen, Germany, where a Dollars
5m (Pounds 3.2m) investment is under way to make products whose
computational speeds are four times higher than those available today and
whose weight is more than halved.
At the high-tech end of the electronics spectrum, two trends are emerging
which indicate a demand for higher performances, says Manfred Buchwald, HP
program manager. One is the arrival of multimedia applications where the
massive volumes of computation impose a high-speed requirement. The other is
a growing miniaturisation trend in telecommunications where the emphasis is
on size and weight.
The more sophisticated the electronics, the more components there are to be
crammed into as small a space as possible on a circuit board. The
limitations that Buchwald foresees, however, concern not the size of
individual components but the circuitry connecting them. This also becomes
more complex the more components there are. The circuitry is laid out on a
stack of boards connected by electrically-conducting holes.
Developed by Dyconex in Zurich, HP's electronics facility combines a new
method of making the electrically-conducting holes with a new backing, or
substrate, material. Instead of drilling the holes - an operation which is
not practical for hole diameters of less than 200 microns because of the
brittleness of drilling tools - a chemical etching process is employed.
Plasma etching is already used for delicate cleaning tasks, such as the
removal of fingerprints from surfaces. It uses microwaves to crack oxygen
molecules in a vacuum. These attack the polyimide, reducing it to carbon
dioxide and water. The process is quick, enabling all 30,000 holes on one
board to be made in 15 minutes, compared with conventional mechanical
drilling which takes 4 1/2 hours, according to Buchwald.
The Swiss DYCOstrate technology brings other benefits. The smaller hole size
permits the width of the lines and spaces to be minimised - to less than
half their current width within a year, says Buchwald. More circuitry can
then be crammed on to a smaller area, reducing the number of layers needed
for the full circuit board, the fundamental component of electronic
equipment.
'Experience so far has shown that DYCOstrate will reduce the number of
layers from an average of eight-10 to two-four which will give a thinner and
lighter substrate with significantly improved electrical and
thermo-mechanical properties,' says Buchwald. With fewer layers, the
distance between components is shorter and the connection is straighter, so
that the transmission of a signal from one component to another is faster.
Today, computers send signals at a rate of 100m-150m per second (their
clockrate is 100-150 MHz). With DYCOstrate, Buchwald believes this will be
speeded up to 400 MHz by 1996. The development time for an electronics
product will also be considerably reduced as a result of DYCOstrate
technology, Buchwald says, because it is easier to design for fewer layers.
For a 12-layer board, it takes a computer program about two days to
calculate the best possible component layout, he says. But, if the number of
layers can be reduced to four, this calculation can be completed in 30-45
minutes.
The result, says Buchwald, is that the overall development time of a product
can be cut by one to two weeks by cutting the number of layers in the
electronic boards from 12 to four. This is especially important for getting
products to market on time. Items such as workstations have a sales life of
only 26-30 weeks before the arrival of next-generation equipment.
HP is pinning great hopes on the new DYCOstrate technology. Its success will
depend on its early use in the industry and the degree to which it becomes
accepted as a standard. Buchwald is optimistic. 'Within five years, 50 per
cent of the Boblingen facility's output will be produced using the Swiss
know-how. If not, something is wrong.'
If HP's hopes are realised, DYCOstrate's Swiss inventors have a bright
future. They still own the technology and will sell licences to any
manufacturer wishing to buy it.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Technology: Taiwan's hole in one
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Taiwan is aiming to capture the lion's share of a fledgling but potentially
huge market in the newest high-tech wrinkle in golf paraphernalia.
In a textbook case of Taiwan's state-led industrial advancement, the
government has transferred technology which it developed for the defence and
aerospace industries to the manufacture of golf clubs.
The Materials Research Laboratory, part of the quasi-official Industrial
Technology Research Institute, took existing carbon filament winding
technology and applied it to the construction of golf club shafts.
Gloria Wu, a spokeswoman for the laboratory, says the technique provides
greater power and control for the player. She compared the conventional
tape-rolling technique with making an egg roll, which leaves pockets of
empty space. 'Using the filament winding method, there are no air spaces,'
she explained.
A private Taiwanese sporting goods company, Advanced Composite Design,
recently began production of clubs using the technology. Four other local
manufacturers are to start by the end of the year.
Wu believes filament winding will supplant other techniques over the next
few years. With five Taiwan companies making clubs with it, the government
hopes to corner a 70 to 80 per cent share of the world market.
Taiwan sporting goods manufacturers have already established a strong
position making tennis rackets, fishing rods, bicycles and golf clubs.
Soaring land and labour costs have prompted many Taiwan companies to move
factories to southeast Asian countries and China. But makers of carbon-fibre
golf clubs and other high-tech sports products have kept their manufacturing
facilities in Taiwan.
Ever on the lookout for a club that can propel that little white ball
further and with more precision, aficionados of the game are already lining
up. 'We've already got so many orders for the new clubs, we can't keep up,'
says Wu.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): The personal
chemistry test - How to choose the right PR consultant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Selecting a public relations consultancy may seem a daunting task requiring
a great deal of time, long lists of criteria and scores of interviews with
potential agencies. But, in many ways, the process boils down to
personalities.
'The most important thing is to look for personal chemistry,' says Stephen
Whitehead, head of PR for the UK operations of Glaxo, the pharmaceuticals
company.
Finding the perfect PR is not as simple as spotting a stranger across a
crowded room. 'It is not the same as meeting someone at a party and having a
nice chat with them,' says Whitehead. 'You want someone who will stand up to
you. We do not want someone who is going to say 'yes' all the time, because
we believe that out of disagreement comes creativity.'
Most companies and PR consultancies agree, however, that a few standard
steps must be taken. The first is to develop a concise, but comprehensive,
written brief that expresses clearly why the company wants PR.
According to Meg Holmes, general manager of the PR Register, which steers
clients through the selection process, the brief should set out requirements
in a number of areas, including customer relations, corporate affairs,
crisis and issues management, internal communications, parliamentary
lobbying and links with charities.
The next step is to select a range of agencies. Information about
consultancies is available in directories such as the Hollis UK Press and
Public Relations Annual, which lists 1,200 agencies, separated into
specialist categories.
Organisations such as the PR Register, the Public Relations Consultants
Association, the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers and the
Institute of Public Relations will also advise companies on appropriate
agencies.
'The temptation is to go for too long a list of agencies,' says John Brown,
deputy chief executive at Burson Marsteller, a leading agency. 'But it
wastes your time as a client and the agency's time in preparing
presentations.' He recommends a short list of no more than six
consultancies.
Brown says companies should whittle down their choices by setting exact
criteria for what they want the PR to accomplish. 'By saying we need A, B, C
and D you can probably get down to five or six agencies that could possibly
meet these needs,' he says.
Each consultancy on the list should see the brief, and then prepare a
'credentials' or 'chemistry' presentation. 'After these meetings we
guarantee that one or two will drop off the list,' says Holmes.
The final two or three agencies should be invited to give a full creative
presentation, which usually lasts about an hour. Companies should insist
that those who will work on their business give the pitch. 'Some agencies
tend to have luminaries to do the presentation and then the secretaries do
the work on the account,' warns Steve Gebbett, director and head of
marketing at Charles Barker, a London-based agency.
The ultimate decision should be based on the programme and how it conforms
to the company's brief, awareness of the company's market and competitors,
political sensitivity, creativity - and, of course, the all-important
personal chemistry.
Finally, 'do not think the world will change just because you have appointed
a PR company', says Kenneth Miles, director general of the Incorporated
Society of British Advertisers. 'But do expect something to happen and have
an idea how to evaluate it.'

FT  08 SEP 94 / Accountancy: Time for auditors to look back to the future -
Andrew Jack examines the delays in publishing a white paper two years after
the McFarlane report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging by the tardy handling of its most contentious proposals yet, a
mischief-maker might suggest that the accountancy profession has recently
created a new type of 'expectations gap'. It comes in the form of the
silent, ever-expanding void into which responses have tumbled since the
publication of the Auditing Practices Board's 'Future development of
auditing' document.
Almost two years after publication in November 1992 of the green paper,
widely dubbed the 'McFarlane report' after its chairman, the dozens of
submissions reacting to its ideas have now been made public. The official
response in the form of a long-promised 'white paper' has yet to materialise
 -and is apparently not likely to appear before early next year.
Mr Ian Plaistowe, a senior partner with Arthur Andersen, has since taken on
and relinquished the presidency of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
England and Wales. He has also taken over chairing the APB, while his
predecessor has retired and other members of the board moved on. Mr John
McFarlane, who co-ordinated the green paper, has switched from his top role
at Citibank to take a board seat with Standard Chartered and recently
relocated to Hong Kong.
Some have no doubt benefited from the delays. A number of organisations
seemed incapable of responding in time for the date for submissions - which
was March 1993. More seriously, others may have hoped that its radical ideas
would simply fade away, such as Baker Tilly, the accountancy firm which
dismissed the entire McFarlane report in a few paragraphs.
In the meantime, some of those submitting their views have had time to
change their minds. The Chartered Association of Certified Accountants, for
example, has switched its views on auditor liability, arguing then that the
position must be reformed, but earlier this year deciding that there was no
need for amendments.
Overall, the delay might have had some advantages. It does allow a little
more time for reflection and a better historical perspective on the debate.
As Mr Prem Sikka of the University of London and his colleagues point out,
the UK accountancy bodies have persistently taken a sectional view and
resisted reform throughout the twentieth century.
He says the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales
unsuccessfully tried to oppose the publication of a profit and loss account
for companies in 1926, of an audit report in 1948, and of turnover in 1967,
for instance.
Browsing through the responses to the McFarlane report makes interesting
reading. Coopers &amp; Lybrand's English firm takes a constructive though
critical perspective. Its Irish partner firm is more outspoken, arguing in
an unusually candid letter that intensive price competition has led to 'a
dramatic reduction' in the level of audit fees for most companies.
The firm warns that this situation may risk a limitation on the scope of
audits as savings are sought to meet reduced fee levels; and restrictions on
the independence of auditors as management threatens to put audits out to
proposal or to withhold support for the auditors' reappointment.
One depressing element in the submissions is the lack of responses from
companies. Most are from accountancy firms, their professional organisations
and trade bodies, with just a smattering of - generally far shorter -
letters from businesses and individuals adding to the pile.
More sad is the correspondingly narrow focus of the responses that results.
Most take an extremely blinkered view, concentrating on criticising many of
the recommendations for being too radical or 'impractical' or simply too
costly.
Self-interest is often transparent in the replies, with the Institute of
Internal Auditors arguing for a greater role for internal audit, for
instance. Nonetheless, the importance of the function carried out by its
members is also flagged up by the Royal Bank of Scotland's response, which
points to the findings of a recent study showing that a tiny fraction of
significant computer fraud issues were discovered by the external auditors.
One apparently safe proposed reform is the idea that the dependency of a
firm on a single client should be reduced, with the permissable fee income
which could be generated being reduced perhaps from 10 per cent to 5 per
cent. Endorsement of the idea crops up in the responses with a regularity
that might lead a cynic to think it was the result of collusion. It is
almost the sole recommendation for change endorsed by the Big 6 accountancy
firms and the English Institute. The only thing on which these large
entities appear to agree is that there should be no other more radical
reforms, such as a ban on the provision of lucrative non-audit services to
audit clients by the same firm.
But hidden among the blandishments and defensive gestures are some important
points from others. One of the most controversial is the idea that auditors
should not be able to provide other services to their audit clients, such as
tax or consulting advice. The large firms always dismiss suggestions that
this practice jeopardises their independence.
However, Sir Brian Unwin, chairman of Customs &amp; Excise, (also now replaced
since the date of his letter), is among those who says he has 'reservations'
about the practice, which is all but forbidden for auditors to public sector
bodies.
Similar views come from others including the Chartered Institute of
Management Accountants (Cima), a number of the smaller accountancy firms and
even from the Association of Authorised Public Accountants (AAPA),
representing the rump of accountants recognised by the government to
practice but outside the remit of the other professional accountancy bodies.
Cima also argues for the creation of an Audit Commission to take over the
regulation of auditing in the profession, both standards-setting and
policing, wresting the Auditing Practices Board from the clutches of the
accountancy bodies alone.
The AAPA calls for a Royal Commission to examine - given similar large-scale
public inquiries into the subject in the USA and elsewhere. While the
process might be cumbersome, the idea does at least highlight the difficulty
because of the lack of independent research currently available. Most
derives instead from the profession.
However, there is almost universal rejection of ideas still being considered
by the Auditing Practices Board in the longer-term to introduce some form of
'shareholder panel' to bring auditors back closer to their true clients and
away from the pressures of the directors in a way that jeopardises their
independence when publicly reporting.
Even so, Prudential, Standard Life and others endorse in principle the idea
of some form of 'audit panel' which might oversee or mediate disputes over
work or auditor appointments across quoted companies.
Even some of the larger accountancy firms such as Grant Thornton and Moore
Stephens are in favour of further discussions on the topic.
A number of organisations do argue for a longer, 'free-form' report from the
auditors in companies' annual reports, which would provide some useful
information rather than the existing bland pro forma read by so few. These
include the 100 Group of leading company finance directors.
But if the Auditing Practices Board does not get on and produce its revised
white paper soon, in the light of these submissions, any chance of
meaningful reforms before the new millennium may start to seem impossible.
It should not give its critics that satisfaction.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Swans song played out on proud Tyneside: Why the receivers
have lost faith in the future of the shipbuilder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If a committed workforce, a fine reputation and a proud history could
guarantee a commercial future, the Tyneside shipbuilder Swan Hunter should
be looking ahead with confidence.
But none of these things can compensate for lack of orders, or for lack of
the financial and political muscle on which orders may depend.
This week's news from receivers Price Waterhouse that the prospects of sale
as a going concern are remote, and that it would start considering offers
for the piecemeal sale of assets, signals the end of Swan Hunter, barring
some unexpected last-minute intervention.
The impending closure is a body blow for the company's loyal and skilled
workforce, its suppliers and Tyneside's economy.
In the 1980s Swan Hunter underwent a radical change in working practices and
heavy job losses. But no amount of pruning and workforce flexibility could
overcome more fundamental difficulties.
The management buy-out team which privatised Swans in 1986 did not have
access to adequate financial reserves to withstand the reduction in UK
defence orders - or the government's increasing emphasis on driving down
costs and passing financial risks on to contractors by imposing large
performance guarantees.
The buy-out team knew it needed to break into export markets to reduce
reliance on UK defence contracts, but in spite of expensive and sustained
effort it failed to win export orders for new ships.
But the Pounds 5m for which the government sold Swan Hunter to the buy-out
team should have given pause for thought compared with privatisation prices
of other warship yards in the mid-1980s. Vosper Thornycroft was sold for
Pounds 18.5m, Yarrow for Pounds 34m and VSEL/Cammell Laird for Pounds 100m,
with Pounds 60m payable initially.
Within weeks of the buy-out Swans failed to win an order for a Ministry of
Defence auxiliary oiler replenishment vessel. It went to Harland and Wolff
in politically sensitive Belfast. In 1991, completion of the British
Antarctic Survey ship cost Swans Pounds 17m, wiping out reserves. On
receivership in May 1993 it had a net debt of Pounds 51m.
Of the other privatised warship yards Yarrow on the Clyde has the financial
security of being owned by the conglomerate GEC.
VSEL in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, has a financial cushion from its Trident
nuclear submarine programme and a tactical alliance with Norwegian-owned
Clydeside merchant shipbuilder Kvaerner which helped VSEL win the helicopter
carrier whose loss sent Swans into receivership.
On the south coast Vosper Thornycroft is underpinned by an extremely strong
export performance.
Cammell Laird in Birkenhead was closed by VSEL last year, after a failed
search for a buyer.
The government's insistence that it would like to see Swan Hunter survive,
but must follow the rules of competitive tendering, has a hollow ring for
Swans' supporters.
They point to the guaranteed 12-year MoD refit workload promised last year
to the Rosyth dockyard as evidence that, where the political will exists,
rules can bend.
They say that Swans, in a Labour-dominated area with only one Tory MP, has
not enjoyed the support given to areas where the Conservatives have more at
stake.
Mr Peter Chapman, one of Swans' union campaigners, said: 'They'd prefer to
sacrifice Trotter's seat rather than Rifkind's' The Edinburgh Pentland seat
of Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, is not far from Rosyth.
Nor has the government accepted the argument that Swans' closure will create
monopolies in capability, driving up prices.
None of Swans' competitors wants to be seen dancing on its grave but,
quietly, the view is expressed that the shrinking MoD order-book could
simply not sustain four warship yards. VSEL says orders from the government
are enough to support a maximum of three.
The question now is whether it can sustain that many.

The TUC congress yesterday adopted an emergency resolution condemning lack
of government support for Swan Hunter, David Goodhart writes. Mr Barry Davis
of the AEEU engineering and electrical union said the government had lied to
the people of Tyneside and to CMN, the potential buyer. 'We were all given
hope, but now we know that they had decided in January this year to close
the yard.'

FT  08 SEP 94 / Inquiry 'cleared Brent Walker'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An investigation by Brent Walker in 1989 into press claims about irregular
transactions by its film division was thorough and proved there was nothing
improper, Mr George Walker, the company's former chairman, told an Old
Bailey jury yesterday.
Giving evidence in his defence Mr Walker said the allegations that two
transactions selling film rights worth more than Pounds 7m had not been
carried out at proper 'arms length' caused him considerable concern.
'It was very important to me because we were being accused of malpractice in
the company,' he said.
Mr Walker and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, a former Brent Walker finance director,
deny charges of theft, false accounting and conspiring to falsify the
company's accounts.
Mr Walker said the inquiry, by outside lawyers and accountants, proved the
transactions were 'totally right'.
The trial continues today.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Breakthrough made on cause of diabetes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW DERRINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scientists have taken a big step towards understanding the genetic basis of
diabetes, which affects 150,000 people in the UK. They have used a
rapid-search technique to identify two genes likely to lead to the disease.
Mr James Copeman, an author of one of two papers describing the results in
the journal Nature today, says the technique means research into diabetes
and other complex diseases is going to move very rapidly in the next 10
years.
One of the papers, published by a group of 16 scientists from institutions
in the UK, identifies new genes predisposing to insulin-dependent diabetes
on chromosome 11 and on chromosome 6. Independently, 14 scientists from
institutes in France, the UK and the US have also identified the gene on
chromosome 11.
This independent confirmation of one of the genes is an important validation
of the new technique for finding the genes for complex diseases - those that
are influenced by more than one gene - which include schizophrenia, heart
disease and cancer.
Mr Copeman said the UK research group would pursue two lines of work: to
study the way the two newly identified genes worked and to search for more
genes.
So far the group has identified 16 further possible locations in its search
of the whole genome - the complete set of human genes. Mr Copeman suspects
about 10 of these will turn out to be important for diabetes. Checking each
possible location takes two months.
In insulin-dependent diabetes the patient's immune system destroys the
insulin-secreting cells of the pancreas. Insulin is essential for the uptake
of glucose into cells. Of the four genes identified so far the most
important is IDDM1, which was already identified, and appears to be involved
in the development of the immune system. The other three genes, the two new
ones and IDDM2, appear to be of roughly equal importance.
The research involved comparing the genetic material from pairs of diabetic
children in a group of 96 diabetic families. By identifying regions of the
genome that are the same in both children, suspect locations can be
identified. The research used a set of 'markers' - parts of the genome that
are present in everybody - to identify exactly which parts of the genome
contained the suspect genes.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Black market 'undermines CFC campaign'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 'black market' in chloro-fluorocarbons (CFCs) is slowing the transition to
environmentally friendly substitutes, an Imperial Chemical Industries
executive said yesterday.
Mr Michael Harris, external relations manager of Klea, the ICI business that
makes CFC substitutes, told a British Association press conference in
Loughborough that illegal CFCs were flooding into Europe. As a result, CFCs
would continue to affect the protective ozone layer in the upper atmosphere
for longer than scientists had predicted. A ban on CFC manufacturing takes
effect in the European Union at the end of this year and in the rest of the
world at the end of 1995.
Dr Joe Farman, who discovered the seasonal 'ozone hole', told the meeting
that 70 per cent of ozone was lost over the Antarctic between August and
October last year. This year's hole 'is developing strongly', he said. 'It's
looking similar to last year.'
Mr Harris estimated that thousands of tonnes of CFCs were reaching western
Europe illegally. He could not say where they were manufactured, though it
is believed that eastern Europe or Asia are likely sources.
'The big high-profile users have switched to CFC substitutes, not only for
public-relations reasons but also because they want to be up with the new
technology,' Mr Harris said.
The black market relies on large numbers of small CFC users who do not want
to make changes in their equipment to use the substitute chemicals. CFCs
still cost only half as much as the substitutes.
Mr Harris blamed governments for 'losing interest in the ozone issue just at
the time when we need the most draconian monitoring and enforcement to make
sure that we really are getting rid of CFCs'.
He said all the technology and manufacturing capacity was in place to
provide safe substitutes for all CFC applications without causing any
disruption to industry.

FT  08 SEP 94 / CBI sets target for links with schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Confederation of British Industry yesterday issued a new code of
practice for building links between companies and schools. It set a target
for all its members to have links with education by the year 2000.
It said companies should agree goals for their school links, which should be
managed 'as rigorously as any business project' and assessed by Ofsted, the
government schools inspectorate.
Mr Ian Dixon, chairman of the CBI's education policy panel, said: 'We can -
and must - do better. The challenge now is to maintain the momentum and to
improve the quality, particularly in planning, monitoring and evaluating
links.'
The announcement followed publication of research by Cellnet and Motorola
for the Institution of Electrical Engineers, which found that
secondary-school pupils did not find science teaching relevant, and were
deprived of 'real life' role models to make science and technology
interesting.
It revealed that 85 per cent of teachers found science and technology
'difficult', while only 29 per cent of pupils used this description.
Teachers were also more likely than pupils to perpetuate gender imbalances ,
with 65 per cent describing science as a 'male domain'.
The CBI said business-school links should aim to encourage 'relevant
knowledge' in pupils, and help with recruitment.
A survey by the London School of Economics for the CBI showed that 80 per
cent of UK companies intended to continue or extend school links in the next
three years, but only 14 per cent of them used performance indicators to
monitor activity. Fifteen per cent of primary schools and a third of
secondary schools included links in their formal development plans.
The survey shows that, since 1988, 57 per cent of companies have increased
their involvement with secondary schools.
Since 1988, more than half of all companies have started work with schools
aimed at providing relevant skills. These include help with curriculum
development and 'young enterprise' schemes, where managers are seconded to
help pupils run mock companies, mock interviews, and work-based scientific
projects.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Profit-pay cut angers unions at LWT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unions at London Weekend Television, a subsidiary of the Granada Group,
yesterday expressed anger at the imposition of a sharp cut in profit-related
pay at the London ITV company.
Staff were told 3 per cent of LWT's 1994-95 profits would be divided among
staff as profit-related pay for the financial year starting on October 1.
The pool for the current year is 7 per cent, and it was 8 per cent last
year.
The cut in profit-related pay comes less than two months after Granada
integrated the non-programme making activities of Granada Television and
LWT, causing the loss of between 150 and 200 jobs from a combined staff of
2,000. To sweeten the pill, staff will be paid monthly 'on account' 4 per
cent of their qualifying salary from the eventual total of profit-related
pay.
LWT staff were warned by Mr Michael Southgate, deputy managing director,
that the longer-term aim was to work towards a common Granada/LWT
profit-related pay scheme. LWT staff fear this may cause a further erosion.
There is also concern that possible cuts in management bonuses at LWT will
adversely affect a forthcoming issue of employee shares. Top LWT managers,
many of them millionaires from a management share scheme, agreed to make
money available to fund an employee share scheme. Not all the money has been
handed over and reduced bonuses may hinder the process.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Banham sets out Shropshire split
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Telford should be given an all-purpose unitary authority, and the other five
district councils in Shropshire should be merged to form one large
authority, the Local Government Commission recommended yesterday.
It said this was the only alternative to the current two-tier position,
which splits responsibility for services between Shropshire County Council
and six district councils. Local people will be consulted about the options
over the next two months.
The commission, chaired by Sir John Banham, estimated that creating the two
unitaries would cost between Pounds 13m and Pounds 16m, but would eventually
save Pounds 4m to Pounds 6m annually.
Under the plan, Wrekin district, dominated by the new town of Telford, would
split away from the rest of the county, which would be labelled
'Shropshire'. The commission will also consult on extending Wrekin to the
south to take in seven parishes from Bridgnorth district.
This option provoked fierce opposition from local politicians, because the
county and four of the districts had all supported leaving the two-tier
system intact.
Many had expected the commission to recommend making Telford unitary and
maintaining the status quo in the rest of the county.
The cross-party Association of District Councils welcomed the proposals for
Wrekin. However, it said a single authority for the rest of Shropshire would
be too remote to represent the views of local people properly.
The district councils of Bridgnorth, Oswestry and North and South Shropshire
all said they would prefer the two-tier status quo to this option, although
Shrewsbury &amp; Atcham favoured unitaries.
The Labour-led Association of County Councils said residents had been given
a 'fair choice' between a unitary option and keeping the status quo. It said
'questions must be asked about the viability of a unitary authority based on
the Wrekin', because the new organisation would be too small.

FT  08 SEP 94 / New measure of inflation trends unveiled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new statistical system for predicting inflation trends was unveiled
yesterday by a City bank amid claims that it provides a more reliable guide
than those used by the Bank of England.
The system, developed by broker Goldman Sachs, sets out to create leading
indicators for inflation using a composite basket of economic data - a
method broadly similar to the Central Statistical Office's cyclical leading
indicators for the UK economy.
The concept of creating a composite leading indicator for inflation has
recently received considerable attention among economists and academics.
Goldman Sachs is the first City bank to unveil a leading inflation
indicator.
It says that its system is needed because the separate indicators used by
the Bank of England to determine when an interest rate rise might be
required are not providing particularly reliable forecasts of future
inflation trends.
At present the Bank assesses whether monetary tightening is needed by taking
an overall view of six factors - average earnings, market inflation
expectations, commodity prices, corporate profit margins, capacity
contraints and M0, the narrowest measure of money supply.
The Bank of England said yesterday it was 'watching with interest' the
debate about using composite leading indicators.
Mr David Walton, senior economist at Goldman Sachs, admitted that one
shortcoming of the new system was that the lag between turning points in the
series and future inflation trends had been highly variable.
Nevertheless, he warned that the series strongly suggested that the downward
trend in underlying retail price inflation would end this year, and might
have occurred already.
Goldman Sachs' shorter leading index - composed of average earnings, import
price and long-dated gilt yields data - has risen since the beginning of
January.
In the past four decades a rise in this series has always heralded a rise in
inflation - usually about six months in advance, but the lag has varied
between one and 10 months.
The longer leading index, which incorporates a range of economic data and
appears to predict trends 20 months in advance, has been rising steadily for
36 months.
Lags in this series have varied in the past between five and 44 months.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Erratic growth predicted for UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK economy is likely to continue growing in the coming months, albeit at
a slightly erratic pace, according to the Central Statistical Office's
leading economic indicators.
The longer leading index, which highlights trends 13 months in advance and
is composed of a broad basket of economic statistics, has risen since April.
This is primarily because of increases in housebuilding starts, rising
business optimism and positive contributions from the yield curve.
The shorter leading index, which points to trends five months in advance,
has fallen in the first half of the year, although preliminary information
suggests that it rose in July as a result of rising share prices and
consumer confidence. This index incorporates data on borrowing, car
registrations, share prices, business and consumer confidence surveys.
The CSO said the coincident index, which monitors current trends, had
increased steadily since the start of the year with M0 - the narrowest
measure of money supply - and output data making a particularly strong
contribution.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Clarke and George tackle rates conundrum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank
of England, yesterday reviewed official interest rates as most City analysts
predicted that they would stay unchanged for the time being.
But the possibility of an eventual rise in base rates from their current
5.25 per cent was underlined by the Treasury's latest monthly monetary
report. It said recent indicators pointed to a further strengthening of
economic activity.
The report, prepared for the meeting of the two men, highlighted the dilemma
facing the Treasury and Bank. On the one hand underlying inflation was at
its lowest for 27 years in July and the broadest inflation measure - the
gross domestic product deflator - at its lowest for 31 years in the second
quarter. But growth - revised up to 3.7 per cent in the year to the second
quarter - was the strongest since the final quarter of 1988.
The report said: 'Monthly indicators point to a further strengthening of
activity.' It cited continuing growth in retail sales, manufacturing output,
output expectations and falling unemployment.
Yesterday Halifax Building Society, the UK's biggest mortgage lender, voiced
its fears about the impact of an interest rate increase on the fragile
recovery in the housing market. Announcing the society's interim results, Mr
Jon Foulds, chairman, said that consumer confidence was lagging well behind
the upturn shown in official statistics. He said: 'We are concerned that any
rise in interest rates would damage a very delicately poised housing market
recovery.'
Mr David Gilchrist, corporate development manager, said the society was
expecting some recovery in the autumn. But if interest rates and perhaps
taxes rose at about Budget time in late November, the housing market could
remain depressed through the start of next year.
As usual, the Treasury report gave no insight into official thinking on
interest rates while officials refused to comment on yesterday's meeting.
But City analysts suggested that Mr Clarke would be unlikely to opt for a
pre-emptive interest rate rise at this stage and might prefer to wait for
November, when next month's Conservative party conference will be safely out
of the way.
The next Clarke/George monetary meeting will be on September 26. That will
allow Mr Clarke to attend the Commonwealth finance ministers' meeting in
Malta late this month and the annual meetings of the International Monetary
Fund and World Bank soon after.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Government to survey industry on research
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Cabinet Office will start this week to send 8,000 detailed
questionnaires to industrialists, scientists and engineers.
It is the next stage of Technology Foresight, the government's programme to
draw up research priorities for the next 10 to 20 years.
Each of the 15 Technology Foresight panels has drawn up a questionnaire for
its industrial sector, asking about 80 questions covering the market
opportunities that will be most important to the UK and the scientific and
technological advances that will underpin them.
The financial services questionnaire asks for opinions about statements
ranging from 'DNA identification is socially acceptable as a universal
authenticator of transactions' to 'computer programs regularly outperform
human managers in portfolio management'.
The questionnaire is the first stage of the survey. The second stage,
starting in November, will give respondents the opportunity to revise their
views in the light of opinions expressed in the first phase.
Sir William Stewart, the government's chief scientist, told the British
Association that the findings from the questionnaires, with the results of
autumn regional workshops around Britain, 'will be drawn together to guide
long-term priorities for government-funded science and for research and
development in the private sector.'
The ultimate purpose of Technology Foresight, Sir William said, was 'about
developing a longer-term vision. The vision should not be developed by
bureaucrats . . . it has to be developed by the scientific community, by
academia, marketing people'.
Sir William reassured academic researchers that 'we cannot leave our
scientific infrastructure solely to the market'.

FT  08 SEP 94 / BT risks action on work patterns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications and the National Communications Union could be
heading for industrial conflict over the company's proposals for new
attendance patterns.
BT wants more engineers available on weekday evenings and weekends and is
offering the 27,000 affected workers four separate attendance patterns. The
company says it expects employees to sign up to one of the patterns by
September 16.
Mr Tony Young, NCU general secretary, said yesterday that any attempt to
force employees to accept new contracts would lead to a strike ballot.
Union officials had hoped that their success in negotiating a Pounds 1,000
one-off payment for workers choosing the weekend patterns, and a clause
insisting that workers could volunteer for any of the new patterns, would be
sufficient to head off industrial action.
But a large majority of the employees has rejected the deal in a
consultative ballot.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Gas industry and users step up call for legislation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The gas industry and consumer groups yesterday stepped up their lobbying
efforts to persuade the government to include a new bill on gas in the
Queen's Speech this autumn.
Utilicorp, the US group which has established joint ventures with a number
of regional electricity groups, said that 'scaremongering' by British Gas
had 'meant that the benefits of competition have been obscured'.
A report entitled 'Gas: The Final Act' said continuing uncertainty about
whether the government remained committed to the timetable to open up the
domestic market was causing big problems for independent gas marketing
companies.
The uncertainty meant that they were putting off investment decisions that
needed to be taken to prepare for the phased opening of the household market
for gas from 1996.
The Consumers Association appealed to the government for legislative action.
In a letter to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, the
association said: 'A truly competitive market . . . is the best spur to
quality improvement and lower prices.'
British Gas said it was committed to the introduction of competition. But
legislation had to be 'introduced on an equal basis . . . so that everyone
shares the social obligations currently undertaken by British Gas'.
A cabinet sub-committee is to meet later this month under the chairmanship
of Mr Heseltine to decide whether to include the bill on gas in the
legislative agenda.
Political support in the government and the Conservative party for gas
competition has been undermined in recent months by fears that many
consumers might face sharp price rises in the transition to competition.
This would result from British Gas moving away from uniform pricing to that
which reflected the actual costs of serving individual customers.
The company says its biggest and best-paying customers subsidise those which
have poor payment records or use small amounts of gas.
Gas industry executives believe advisers to Mr John Major, the prime
minister, are the biggest stumbling block to inclusion of the bill. The
advisers are said to fear the political consequences of higher gas prices
for some consumers.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Business channel aimed at City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Flextech, the fast-growing media group controlled by Tele-Communications,
the largest cable television operator in the US, and Dow Jones, publisher of
the Wall Street Journal, will today announce the creation of a European
Business Channel.
It is believed that the two companies are prepared to invest as much as
Dollars 50m (Pounds 32.2m) in the venture and that an agreement has been
reached with Videotron, the cable company, to carry the service to the City
of London.
The London-based channel, to be launched in the first quarter of next year,
will start transmitting 18 hours a day before moving to a 24-hour-a-day
service. It will be carried on the Eutelsat satellite system and will
broadcast to cable networks and satellite dishes all over Europe.
The plan is to launch a dual service - a conventional service of business
news and features with material from Dow Jones business television channels
in the US and the Asian Business Channel in which TCI is an investor.
There will also be a more specialist digital service to be broadcast direct
to the computer screens of market professionals.
This is likely to compete with Reuters Financial Television, which runs a
service aimed at foreign exchange, debt and treasury financial markets in
London.

FT  08 SEP 94 / MPs demand closer scrutiny of royal spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior officers of the royal household responsible for the Pounds 20m of
taxpayers' money spent each year on Buckingham Palace and other residences
occupied by the Queen and her family face closer scrutiny by MPs.
A report by the Commons public accounts committee published yesterday
rejects voluntary arrangements under which information about the use of the
money is made available.
It calls for 'public visibility' of the Pounds 20m a year of public money
involved, with the National Audit Office having an automatic right of access
to the relevant documents.
The committee recommends that the royal household should be required to
publish an annual report and accounts, instead of merely having to submit
them to the Department of National Heritage.
It concludes that there is 'no objection to placing the officials of the
royal household under comparable systems of scrutiny and control to public
servants when dealing with public money'.
Apart from Buckingham Palace the Pounds 20m is used in connection with
Kensington Palace, St James's Palace, Clarence House and Marlborough House
Mews, Windsor Castle, Windsor Great and Home parks, and Hampton Court Mews
and Paddock.
Members of the committee were critical of the arrangements for administering
the net income from public admissions to Buckingham Palace and Windsor
Castle - expected to amount to Pounds 25m in the next four years.
The money, which will go towards the cost of restoring the parts of Windsor
Castle severely damaged by fire in 1992, is administered by Royal Collection
Enterprises.
Mr Michael Peat, director of finance and property services in the royal
household, denied having censured Mr Robert Sheldon, the former Labour
minister and chairman of the committee, for wanting to study the accounts.
Mr Peat likened the decision of Royal Collection Enterprises to give money
towards the restoration of Windsor Castle to a charitable donation.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Insurer halts sales campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Independent Order of Foresters, a mutual life insurer, is withdrawing
from the regulated retail financial services market until next summer, and
will instead concentrate on trying to build up its membership.
Its direct sales force, which had already fallen from 120 a year ago to 90,
is to be absorbed as far as possible in an expansion of the 30-strong
membership sales force.
Membership advisers, who recruit people to join the insurer, do not have to
be authorised to sell financial services products. Members of the
Independent Order of Foresters qualify for insurance-type benefits and take
part in a variety of social events.
Mr Arno Kitts, the insurer's chief executive and compliance officer, said
yesterday the organisation was developing a new range of membership benefits
to be launched in January.
Mr Kitts admitted that the level of new financial services business brought
in by the sales force before the beginning of this month - when the decision
to withdraw was taken - was unlikely to have been profitable.
Distribution costs are an increasingly important factor in the life
industry, as regulatory standards become more demanding. In June the
Independent Order of Foresters was fined Pounds 200,000 by City regulators
for failing to organise its business responsibly.
When the organisation re-enters financial services next year, its new range
of products will be sold through a separate body in order to make a clearer
distinction between the different benefits for members. Mr Kitts said some
116,000 households are members of the organisation.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Thames plan falls short of ambitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A scaled-down plan to regenerate the east Thames corridor, a 30-mile swathe
of land on both sides of the Thames from Docklands to Tilbury and Sheerness,
was published yesterday by the environment department.
The corridor, renamed Thames Gateway, is expected to provide a total of more
than 110,000 new homes, 70,000 of them by 2006. These figures cover all
sites, irrespective of size. It identifies 10,000 acres of land scheduled
for development, including large areas of London's docklands.
The plan falls short of the ambitious proposal for a string of new towns
along both banks of the Thames outlined by Mr Michael Heseltine when, as
environment secretary, he launched the concept of a corridor in 1991.
Mr Heseltine envisaged a 'linear city' to the east of London, providing many
of the 575,000 homes needed in the south-east in the medium-term. Last year
Mr Michael Howard, his successor as environment secretary, unveiled plans to
create 182,000 jobs in the area.
Yesterday Mr David Curry, urban regeneration minister, would say only that
he was 'pretty certain' that up to 100,000 jobs would be created.
The new plan brings together existing development plans for the area to
provide a framework for future development.
No new government money is promised, although transport projects worth
Pounds 4.5bn are either under consideration or have been approved.
Mr Curry said: 'It will set the framework for development of the whole area
for a generation. Thames Gateway must no longer be regarded as London's
backyard. As it is through the area that Europe comes to London, it is a
place to take care over, where first and lasting impressions are gained.'
Mr Curry said development in the area would be to the same high standards
expected in other parts of London and the Home Counties. 'This is not the
cheapo end of the market. We will insist on the same environmental standards
in Ebbsfleet and Erith as apply in Esher, the same in Dagenham as in
Dorking,' he said.
There was a cautious welcome for the plan from Mr Bill Higham, deputy chief
executive of Redbridge council, a London borough on the north bank of the
Thames.
He said: 'It brings the area into sharper focus. Our major concern is that
most of the development envisaged is dependent on private-sector investment.
'Experience has shown that without government commitment to prime the pump,
private-sector investment is usually not forthcoming. There is no sign of
new public-sector investment in this project.'
The Labour-run Association of London Authorities said that the government
had missed an opportunity to build 'affordable homes' and create jobs.
Private-sector developers were enthusiastic. Mr Mark Pennington, project
director of Blue Circle Properties, which owns 5,000 acres of land in the
area, mostly in Kent, said: 'This is definitely a first - the first time the
area has been looked at strategically.'
Consultation ends in November. Once it is finalised, local planners will be
required to fit their planning decisions to it.
Separately, the transport department announced a public consultation on
additional river crossings in the east Thames area. The proposals include a
third crossing at Blackwall to relieve pressure on the two tunnels and two
more crossings to the east.

Hilton International, the hotel chain which is owned by Ladbroke Group,
yesterday announced plans to build a Pounds 17m luxury hotel in Belfast.
The hotel will be one of the biggest developments in the Laganbank area,
Belfast's main inner city project.
Hilton will build the 187-room hotel with Ewart, the Belfast-based property
and investment company. Hilton and Ewart are putting up Pounds 10m in equity
and debt finance and the balance will come from grants from the Laganside
Corporation, with support from the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
Construction is expected to start early next year.

The Corporation of London yesterday announced it had let more than 95 per
cent of the trading space in the refurbished east building of the Smithfield
meat market.
This follows a long dispute over the rents for stalls in the market between
the corporation and Smithfield market traders, who for several years refused
to rent space in the new development.
Smithfield's east building will open in January next year. The corporation
said that it would soon start refurbishing the market's west building.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Eighty-five per cent of people are concerned about environmental problems,
but most are optimistic about improvements, according to a government survey
of public attitudes to the environment.
The national survey showed that most people thought environmental clean-ups
should be paid for by those causing them, even if this meant that the cost
of goods and services had to go up.
Many of the respondents said they were trying to help the environment by
recycling paper and glass, but only a quarter were cutting back on car use,
and just 8 per cent said they had switched to public transport.

<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London has unveiled proposals to increase the efficiency of
'run-offs' - the management of claims faced by syndicates no longer
underwriting new business.
According to a consultative document issued yesterday, companies managing
run-offs will need minimum capital of Pounds 250,000 rising by stages to
Pounds 400,000 for 1999 onwards - the same minimum capital standards as
agents which manage syndicates,
Lloyd's is also proposing to review the experience and qualifications of
run-off company staff and will demand that run-off companies deploy
effective computer systems. Run-off costs amounted to Pounds 135m in 1993.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Teesside offshore yard to be closed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trafalgar House Offshore Holdings yesterday said that one of its two
Teesside yards is to close, Chris Tighe writes.
The group said the closures were part of a restructuring prompted by the
much-reduced market for large offshore modules as the North Sea oil industry
moved to subsea and floating production systems.
The Middlesbrough yard at Linthorpe Dinsdale, known as Redpath Offshore, is
empty but once employed more than 500.
Mr Syd Fudge, managing director of the group, said its other yards, at Port
Clarence on the Tees and Methil, Fife, would remain open and continue
operating normally.
Methil has work until mid-1995 and Port Clarence to 1996. The company is
pursuing orders for both.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Monks slams 'puppet' Horton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's role in the signal workers' dispute was attacked as
'intolerable and dishonest' yesterday by Mr John Monks, TUC general
secretary. He said ministers had 'intervened but wanted to appear innocent'.
The TUC debate on the rail dispute came as Railtrack, the state-owned
company responsible for administering the system, claimed that as much as 57
per cent of the network would be open to services today during the latest
24-hour stoppage.
Delegates at the TUC congress voted unanimously for a motion backing the
signal workers in their 13-week-old action. The motion condemned what it
described as 'the intimidatory tactics deployed by Railtrack'.
The motion went on to criticise the government's 'hypocritical stance',
which it said had 'been exposed by their own pay guidelines on MPs'
salaries'. The motion also called on the TUC general council to make 'urgent
arrangements for a national demonstration in London' in support of the
signal workers.
Summing up a short and highly charged debate, Mr Monks said that Railtrack
was no longer directly involved in resolving the conflict. He said its
strategy was being decided by a cabinet committee chaired by Mr David Hunt
which did not have anybody from Railtrack on it and was briefed by a
committee of officials chaired by Mr Nicholas Montagu, the transport
department's deputy secretary.
'The solution to this dispute lies in the government ceasing to play Mr
Horton's puppet master and in Mr Horton asserting himself as his own man,'
said Mr Monks.
'At the moment the only fair assessment the British people can make is that
the government doesn't care about the railways.'
Mr Wilf Proudfoot, the RMT's deputy general secretary, won a three-minute
standing ovation after moving the motion. 'We want a fair day's pay for a
fair day's work. We are not asking for the world,' he said.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Industry warns on cuts in funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The construction industry yesterday warned of adverse effects on training if
the government cuts its financial contribution.
Leading members of the industry, which has traditionally been a large
trainer of young people through Youth Training, expressed their fears at a
meeting with Miss Ann Widdecombe, minister for employment.
Miss Widdecombe was attending the launch of new occupational standards for
professional and managerial workers.
The industry-wide standards, developed by the Construction Industry Standing
Conference, build on the national vocational qualifications (NVQs) developed
by the industry for manual and craft workers.
The industry believes better workplace training, through the introduction of
NVQs, could bring a 10 per cent improvement in efficiency and produce a
Pounds 4bn savings for its customers.
However, Mr Allan McDougall of the specialist engineering contractors group
said that there were enormous benefits for everyone in the industry. But the
'narrow margins within which hard-pressed employers are required to work
mean they will need maximum encouragement to play their full part in the
necessary implementation and take-up'.
The industry has traditionally met its training needs through the
Construction Industry Training Board, which makes a training levy on
members.
The Department of Employment is examining its Pounds 1.8bn training budgets
and there has been speculation that substantial cuts are planned.
Sir Clifford Chetwood, chairman of the CITB, said he would urge the
government to fund the CITB directly for its new entrants' schemes, rather
than through the 82 Training and Enterprise Councils which deliver
government funded training in England and Wales.
He said such a move could save Pounds 4m in administrative costs.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Democratic Unionists to consider options
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Rev Ian Paisley stood on home territory yesterday, still fuming after
his Downing Street confrontation with Mr John Major.
Outside the Democratic Unionist party's headquarters in East Belfast Mr
Paisley was cheered by a dozen flag-waving supporters. He said he had no
immediate plans to call for a campaign of unionist civil protest. 'I am not
calling on my supporters to take to the streets,' he said. 'We shall be
putting forward practical plans for a Unionist forum.'
The unionist newspaper The Newsletter said it had been inundated with calls
from readers registering disgust at the way Mr Paisley had been treated in
Downing Street. But many unionists were critical of Mr Paisley's position. A
number of senior members of the Ulster Unionist party, including Mr Jim
Wilson, its general secretary, said the DUP leader was undermining the
unionist cause.
Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, and Mr Gerry
Adams are given more credit for achieving the IRA ceasefire than the British
and Irish premiers according to a Gallup poll in today's Daily Telegraph. Mr
Hume scores 27 per cent, Mr Adams 22 per cent, Mr Albert Reynolds 18 per
cent and Mr Major 12 per cent.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Minimum wage a potential 'hot-potato' for Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Union and Labour party leaders yesterday began the shadow-boxing over a
national minimum wage which could turn into more open conflict next year,
David Goodhart writes.
Although the party and unions are strongly committed to the principle of the
minimum wage, Labour leaders refuse to be drawn into supporting any specific
amount or formula.
The TUC Congress yesterday reaffirmed its support for the formula, also
supported by the Labour Party conference, of a national minimum wage to be
set at half male median earnings - now just over Pounds 4 an hour.
Neither Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, nor Mr John Prescott, the
deputy leader, were prepared to back that formula yesterday although both
said they were committed to the principle.
'There are four or five formulas we are looking at,' said Mr Prescott. 'It
is like full employment; we are committed to the principle and now we are
starting to look at its application.'
Mr Alan Jinkinson, general secretary of Unison, expressed doubts about
Labour's commitment. 'I do not know what the depth of Tony Blair's
commitment is to the national minimum wage,' he said. 'I hope he is
sincere.'
Mr Jinkinson, moving yesterday's TUC motion, said the number of people with
incomes below half the national average almost quadrupled during the 1980s
to stand at 11m by 1991.
He stressed that there should be 'no shadow of doubt' about Labour's
commitment to the level of 50 per cent of median earnings.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Diplomacy reigns in the unarmed struggle: The advance of
peace in Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, TIM COONE and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the smoke of battle clears following the IRA's ceasefire announcement,
the peace strategy being followed by the British and Irish governments is
emerging through the haze.
It looked as though the process had gone awry on Tuesday when London
dismissed as 'premature' a historic meeting in Dublin between Mr Albert
Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, and Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein
president.
While Mr Reynolds eagerly accepted Mr Adams' assurance that the IRA had
ended its terrorist campaign, Mr John Major continued to demand guarantees
that there would be no return to violence.
Meanwhile, in a theatrical confrontation in Downing Street, Mr Ian Paisley,
Ulster's single most popular Unionist leader, was ejected from the cabinet
room for refusing to accept that Mr John Major does not tell lies.
The dramatic series of events prompted reports of renewed tensions between
London and Dublin amid speculation that Mr Reynolds wishes to move much
faster towards all-party talks on Northern Ireland than Mr Major thinks
wise.
There are clear differences of perspective between London and Dublin, not
least because most of the carnage inflicted by the IRA has been within the
UK's borders.
The view from Dublin is also coloured by the historical fact that all the
Irish political parties except Labour are descended from the old Sinn Fein
party which campaigned for independence from Britain.
Perhaps because of these links the Irish government is more convinced than
London of the permanence of the Sinn Fein leader's change of heart, and less
concerned about a possible slide back to violence.
In spite of their differences the two governments are moving in tandem
towards the dual objective of entrenching Sinn Fein within the democratic
process while demolishing unionist suspicions of a sell-out to the IRA.
The British government was obliged to deprecate the speed with which Mr
Reynolds moved to meet Mr Adams because of the widespread distaste for the
Sinn Fein leader among unionists and Tory rightwingers.
But ministers are aware that the ceasefire declaration was opposed by a
hardline faction in the IRA, and that it could collapse unless Mr Adams is
able to show results from the so-called 'unarmed struggle.'
For the same reason the government has reduced security in Northern Ireland,
and would not be greatly unhappy to see Mr Adams make a second propaganda
visit to the US, although it would formally urge President Clinton not to
grant a visa.
Mr Major also accepts that Mr Adams cannot deliver the guarantee of a
'permanent' end to violence that London originally demanded because that
would be regarded by the hardliners in the IRA as tantamount to surrender.
Ministers remain hopeful that a form of words can be agreed, although
leading republicans say that further clarification is unlikely in the near
future.
Mr Major's pre-planned confrontation with Mr Paisley was intended to isolate
his hardline Democratic Unionist party by demonstrating that threats and
bluster will achieve nothing.
Mr Major also wanted to provide a contrast between the DUP and the more
constructive role played by Mr James Molyneaux's Ulster Unionist party.
There were signs yesterday that the strategy was working. Mr Paisley
compared Mr Major to Adolf Hitler, but ruled out taking his struggle to the
streets. Mr Ken Maginnis, a senior UUP MP, accused Mr Paisley of 'harming
the cause of unionism', confirming that the UUP will continue to go along
with Mr Major.
The big prize, however, is the prospect of a reciprocal ceasefire by the
loyalist terrorist organisations.
British ministers hope Mr Major's brusque rejection of Mr Paisley's attack
on his integrity will reinforce the government's insistence that no secret
deals have been done with the IRA. The indications are that the loyalist
paramilitaries would probably call a halt to violence if fears of a
'sell-out' could be assuaged.
Unionist leaders with paramilitary links warned yesterday that Tuesday's
nationalist summit in Dublin was being interpreted by some as evidence of
IRA influence.
Officials in both capitals say that the peace process is at an extremely
delicate stage and warn that an upsurge in loyalist violence or a republican
refusal to clarify the ceasefire could cause a breakdown.
Nonetheless, work is continuing on an inter-governmental 'framework'
agreement, expected in the autumn, which will make detailed proposals for
the future. If the ceasefire holds, that will be when the real tough talking
starts.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, told members of the
Orange Order last night that there was no question of the British and Irish
governments imposing a solution on the people of the province.
He said in Belfast's Comber Orange Hall, that joint authority against the
people's will would be incompatible with the principle of consent.
A crowd of protesters gathered outside but the meeting ended without
incident.

FT  08 SEP 94 / 'I cannot do without you,' Blair tells union barons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Fairness not favours' is how Opposition leader Mr Tony Blair describes
relations between the trade unions and a future Labour government led by
him.
His carefully chosen words have been interpreted by some as a sign that he
wants to distance Labour from its union allies. Mr Blair's refusal to back
the rail signal workers has been taken as a sign that he finds the unions an
embarrassment to the party.
But during his dinner with the Trades Union Congress general council in
Blackpool on Tuesday Mr Blair left most union leaders in no doubt that he
believed Labour needed their help to win the next general election. 'I
cannot do without you,' he said.
He emphasised that he was committed to the union agenda of full employment,
a national minimum wage to help end poverty pay, and the introduction of
legal rights for workers.
Mr Blair made clear to his TUC hosts that he would develop policies to
implement those agreed aims at his own pace and not at anybody else's. He
emphasised that Labour would govern in the 'public interest' unbeholden to
any pressure groups such as unions.
Mr Bill Morris, the TGWU union's general secretary, may believe it is
'insulting' to suggest unions are on a par with other voluntary associations
in the eyes of a Labour government, but Mr Blair is determined to avoid
Conservative accusations that either he or his party is in the grip of union
barons.
Nor does he want to return to incomes policies that would force trade unions
to shoulder wider responsibilities in return for political privileges.
None of this should come as any surprise to those with understanding of
party-union links.
When Hugh Gaitskell addressed the TUC as Labour leader on the eve of the
1959 general election he told delegates that they and Labour had 'different
jobs to do. You have your industrial job and we have our political job. We
do not dictate to one another'.
The two wings of the Labour movement had 'common aims' and it was in the
interests of both 'to work in harmony'.
What Mr Blair is suggesting reflects that position and it enjoys the full
support of Mr John Monks, the TUC's modernising general secretary.
The TUC is also keen to keep clear of any return to formalised entanglements
with the Labour party. The close alliance between them in the 1970s,
enshrined in the Social Contract, was a breach with previous practice.
In its evidence to the Donovan royal commission on the unions in 1966, the
TUC under George Woodcock said there was 'a significant divergence of
function' between Labour and the unions.
The TUC said: 'The existence of common roots yet distinct functions is the
most important feature of the relationship. The relationship becomes
strained if either attempts to capitalise on the loyalties which exist, and
the strength of the relationship lies paradoxically in the looseness of the
ties.'
Some union leaders may have reservations, but they support Mr Monks's
strategy to re-establish the TUC's room for political manoeuvre as an
independent campaigning voice in public policy debate.
This is what it enjoyed in the past under Labour prime ministers Clement
Attlee and Harold Wilson before the Social Contract. In this respect,
party-union relations may be returning to what they were during Labour's
political ascendancy nearly 30 years ago.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Paisley blasts 'dictator' Major
</HEADLINE>

   BELFAST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Rev Ian Paisley stood on home territory yesterday, still fuming after
his Downing Street confrontation with Mr John Major.
In a characteristically inflammatory press conference at the new east
Belfast headquarters of the Democratic Unionist party, which he leads, Mr
Paisley referred angrily to the way Mr Major abruptly ended their meeting on
Tuesday.
Flanked by DUP MPs Mr Paisley was cheered by a dozen flag-waving supporters
as he bluntly refused to answer questions from journalists from Irish
nationalist papers and barked abuse at agency and national television
reporters.
He stepped up his war of words with the British government by equating the
prime minister with Hitler. 'It was the stance of a dictator who says that
either you believe me or you go to the gas chambers,' he said. He reiterated
his hardline opposition to the UK-Irish peace process.
At the Downing Street meeting Mr Major repeatedly interrupted Mr Paisley's
attempt to read a long statement on the political situation in Northern
Ireland.
Yesterday Mr Paisley demanded a retraction from a national television
channel which reported that he had locked himself in a Downing Street
lavatory. He said he had read the remainder of his statement to a civil
servant after Mr Major, with two Northern Ireland Office ministers, had
abruptly left the meeting.
He again refused to accept Mr Major's reassurances that there had been no
secret deals with the IRA as part of last week's ceasefire announcement, and
accused the UK and Irish governments being part of 'a conspiracy' to take
Ulster out of the UK.
Mr Paisley said he had no immediate plans to call for a campaign of Unionist
civil protest, as he did in opposition to the Hillsborough agreement in the
1980s. 'I am not calling on my supporters to take to the streets,' he said.
'We shall be putting forward practical plans for a Unionist forum.'
Many unionists outside the DUP were critical yesterday of Mr Paisley's
position. A number of senior members of the Ulster Unionist party, including
its general secretary, Mr Jim Wilson, said the DUP leader was undermining
the Unionist cause at a crucial time in the province's political history.
But the unionist newspaper The Newsletter said it had been inundated with
calls from readers registering disgust at the way Mr Paisley had been
treated in Downing Street.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Post Office chief opposed to minority sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bill Cockburn, chief executive of the Post Office, yesterday warned that
a minority sale of the corporation's shares would be 'unworkable' and the
worst of all possible compromises.
A number of Conservative backbenchers opposed to the government's favoured
option of floating 51 per cent of the Post Office's shares are pressing for
a minority sale to keep the Post Office in the public sector.
The MPs, who include Mr Hugh Dykes, Harrow East, and Mr Nicholas Winterton,
Macclesfield, cite the example of the Dutch Post Office, which recently sold
about 30 per cent of its shares.
Mr Cockburn said: 'This would be the worst of all possible compromises. The
combination of public-sector control without commercial freedom is not a
solution. It would leave the Post Office with disenchanted shareholders and
without a base from which to expand.'
His warning comes as the Union of Communication Workers said the government
had lost its parliamentary majority for privatisation. Union leaders said
that as many as 24 backbench Conservative MPs were ready to vote against
government proposals to sell 51 per cent of the Post Office. This would be
more than enough to defeat its 15-seat majority if all the opposition
parties combined against it.
Other Conservative backbenchers who have voiced opposition to the
government's scheme are Sir Peter Emery, Mrs Ann Winterton, Mr Robert Hicks,
Sir David Knox, Mr Stephen Day, Mr Jim Lester and Sir Edward Heath.
The UCW said that a further 15 Conservative MPs have written sympathetic
letters to concerned constituents, but the union would not reveal their
names at this stage.
Mr Alan Johnson, the UCW's general secretary, said: 'We are pleased Tory MPs
are listening to their constituents' concerns and realising that Post Office
privatisation would destroy a cherished institution in British life. People
everywhere in constituencies around the country have inundated MPs with
letters of protest and this is clearly now having a significant impact.'
A poll commissioned from MORI, the independent survey organisation, by the
Communication Managers' Association and released yesterday, showed 76 per
cent of 350 middle to senior Post Office managers disagreed with the view
that the Post Office could be commercially successful only if privatised.
As many as 64 per cent opposed the government's plan for the Post Office,
with 61 per cent believing it would increase job insecurity and nearly 50
per cent saying that the service to customers would deteriorate.
Mr Cockburn, who recently completed a series of road shows to the
corporation's top 4,000 managers, said: 'People are naturally worried about
change since they do not yet know what the government is going to do. But we
are confident that the message is getting out that we either change or
decline.'

FT  08 SEP 94 / Cayman Islands to send back Cubans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES

<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Cayman Islands will repatriate most of the 395 Cuban refugees in the
British colony and will not accept any more, said Mr Michael Gore, the
colony's governor.
This follows the US rejection of a proposal from the Islands' administration
that the Cubans be transferred to refugee centres in either Panama or the US
naval station at Guantanamo Bay in south-eastern Cuba.
Mr Gore said the Caymanian administration had no alternative but to
repatriate the Cubans 'classified as economic migrants. . . as the US was
unwilling to accept Cuban migrants from Cayman'.
The move highlights Washington's difficulties in persuading Caribbean and
Latin American nations to help house the growing numbers of refugees.
The first of 10,000 Cuban refugees due to be airlifted from Guantanamo to
Panama were moved earlier this week, but Panama's government is only
allowing the refugees to be housed for six months as a humanitarian gesture.
The US coast guard remained busy in the Florida Straits yesterday rescuing
more than 600 Cubans by mid-morning, bringing to 7,217 the number of Cubans
rescued in the first six days of September.
Meanwhile, Mr Ricardo Alarcon, head of the Cuban delegation negotiating with
the US over the flow of Cuban boat people, was returning to Havana for
consultations, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said yesterday.
The Cayman Islands are 120 miles south of Cuba and small numbers of refugees
have been arriving over the past two years. The flow increased recently,
with 56 arriving last weekend, bringing the number since August 10 to 286.
Most are kept in a special camp and others are in the prison. The Islands'
administration said last week this year's refugee budget had been exhausted.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Canny Menem wins second shot: But new constitution could
backfire against the president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Argentina's new constitution is almost tailor-made to suit the interests of
two men - President Carlos Menem and his old rival, Mr Raul Alfonsn, the
opposition Radical party leader and former president.
They negotiated in secret a package of constitutional amendments in which Mr
Alfonsn supported Mr Menem's central objective - lifting a constitutional
ban on successive presidential terms - in exchange for greater powers for
the opposition, the legislature and the judiciary.
Mr Menem is now free to stand for re-election to a second, four-year, term
in May 1995.
However, the reforms which came into force last month, are not popular. Mr
Rosendo Fraga, a pollster and political commentator, says few people believe
the reforms are essential. 'The only reason for reform is Menem's
re-election. The other clauses are only there to justify this.' Mr Menem's
positive image has now dropped below 40 per cent from over 50 per cent last
December.
This has benefited the Frente Grande, an alliance of left-wing parties,
ecologists and disaffected Peronists and Radicals whose support has grown
strongly through opposition to the reforms and Mr Menem's re-election. Its
growth threatens the balance of interests the Radicals and Mr Menem's
Peronist party wrote so carefully into the new constitution.
Take the new election rules. In future, the president will be elected
directly - replacing the old US-style electoral college. Elections will be
held in two rounds, unless the winner takes at least 45 per cent of the vote
first time around. Alternatively, the leading candidate would win with only
40 per cent of the votes if the runner-up is more than 10 percentage points
behind.
This was designed to help the Peronist party, which normally polls over 40
per cent of the vote. But unless his image improves, Mr Menem could have to
go through a bruising second-round vote, and his likeliest contender would
not be a Radical, but Mr Carlos 'Chacho' Alvarez, the Frente's telegenic
leader, who boasts a rating of 24 per cent.
The new constitution adopts a semi-parliamentary form of government which Mr
Alfonsn hopes will give Congress greater leverage over the government. Under
the new rules, the president will appoint a cabinet chief, similar to a
prime minister, to run the government's day to day business. Congress will
be able to sack the cabinet chief with a simple majority in the Senate and
Chamber of Deputies.
The difficulty with this innovation is that Mr Menem has already said he
will not cede fundamental presidential powers. The cabinet chief could
therefore become either an irrelevance or a source of friction between the
president and Congress.
Mr Alfonsn also demanded that the 48-member Senate be increased by half,
with the new members coming from the opposition parties in each of
Argentina's 23 provinces and the federal district of Buenos Aires.
In addition, Congress gains new powers to reject presidential decrees,
control the federal audit office and participate in running the judiciary. A
new system allowing congressional committees to legislate virtually
independent of the floor of the Senate or Chamber of Deputies is intended to
increase the snail's pace of lawmaking.
However, the ruling Peronists dominate both chambers of Congress, so it is
debatable how effective these added powers will be. Furthermore, the
influential congressional committees could fall further under the sway of
special interest groups.
The constitution includes new direct democracy clauses. Anyone who gathers
the signatures of at least 3 per cent of the electorate can directly submit
a bill to Congress. Congress can also call referenda, which if approved,
cannot be vetoed by the president. The president can also call a referendum,
although its result is not binding.
The courts also win greater independence. Mr Menem's domination of the
judiciary - by packing the Supreme Court, or picking party hacks as judges -
is deeply unpopular. A new independent council of magistrates comprising
politicians, lawyers, academics and eminent persons will take over
administrative control of the courts from the Supreme Court and select
judges.
The council's detailed workings will be decided by a congressional law,
which the Peronists will be sure to construct as liberally as possible.
There is always the danger this body will be hijacked by the parties,
undermining its effectiveness.
The governors of Argentina's 23 provinces have also won important new
rights, especially over sharing federal taxes. At the moment, a complicated
formula regulates sharing of federal tax revenues with the provinces.
The governors will probably get more money and win greater independence from
Buenos Aires, strengthening them in their battle with Mr Domingo Cavallo,
the economy minister, who demands they reform their oversized and corrupt
public sectors.
Argentinians have followed the reform process with little interest. Many
people think that instead of rewriting the constitution - this is the third
reform since 1949 - the politicians should first learn to observe the
original 1853 constitution.

Mr Owen Arthur, the new prime minister of Barbados, says his administration
will not devalue the island's currency, despite charges made by his
political opponents in the campaign for Tuesday's general election on the
eastern Caribbean island.
Mr Arthur, a 44 year-old economist, was sworn in last night after his
Barbados Labour party won 19 of the 28 seats in the lower house, ending 10
years of rule by the Democratic Labour party. Mr David Thompson, leader of
the DLP and finance minister in the outgoing administration, is the
opposition leader.
Responding to persistent charges from his political opponents that he
planned a devaluation of the Barbados dollar, which has been under pressure
intermittently over the past four years, Mr Arthur said the currency's
parity, fixed by the government, would not be changed. The government's
priority was a reduction in the island's 22 per cent unemployment rate, he
said.
The election was called 15 months before it was constitutionally due, after
Mr Erskine Sandiford, the former prime minister, lost a vote of no
confidence in parliament when rebellious cabinet members, critical of his
leadership, sided with the opposition.
Mr Arthur's immediate task will be finding measures to support the moderate
growth which the economy is experiencing following three years of stagnation
because of poor performance by tourism and sugar, its main pillars.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Clinton puts his stamp on legal system

<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton may be having mixed success in persuading Congress to
pass the laws he wants, but he is making more progress at putting his stamp
on the men and women who will interpret those laws.
Already, Mr Clinton has won Senate confirmation for 86 of his nominees to be
federal judges, and White House officials hope they may be able to squeeze
another 40 or so through in the next few weeks before the Senate breaks up
ahead of November's congressional elections.
That would not only make a dent in the sizeable backlog of unfilled
judgeships that Mr Clinton inherited from President George Bush; it would
also go some way to changing the complexion of the federal judiciary away
from the conservative nominees of Mr Bush and President Ronald Reagan.
That includes Mr Clinton's two nominees to the nine-member Supreme Court,
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Justice Stephen Breyer, the first two
justices nominated by a Democratic president since President Lyndon Johnson.
In ideological terms, the change is not stark.
Very few of Mr Clinton's nominees have aroused much opposition. Most have
been, like Mrs Ginsburg and Mr Breyer, moderates of unquestioned legal
competence.
This is in contrast to the Justice Department, where in fields ranging from
civil rights to anti-trust the Clinton administration has diverged sharply
from the policies of the Reagan and Bush years.
The biggest confirmation row so far came over Judge Rosemary Barkett, a
former Catholic nun from Florida whose reservations about the death penalty
came under attack. But Ms Barkett eventually won confirmation to a seat on
the 11th circuit federal appeals court, which covers Florida, Georgia and
Alabama.
Another nominee who has aroused some controversy, Judge Lee Sarokin, has yet
to be confirmed.
Mr Sarokin was removed in 1992 from a liability case against a cigarette
company by the 3rd circuit appeals court to which he has now been nominated.
In diversity of background, however, Mr Clinton's selections differ
radically from the white males chosen overwhelmingly by Mr Reagan and Mr
Bush.
Among the judges so far nominated or confirmed, Mr Clinton has already
picked more women than Mr Bush did in his whole four-year term, and over
one-third more than Mr Reagan in eight years. The 28 black Americans he has
nominated beat by almost 50 per cent the combined Reagan-Bush total.

A regional leader of Mexico's opposition Democratic Revolution Party has
been shot dead in the troubled southern state of Chiapas, Reuter reports
from Mexico City.
Mr Roberto Hernandez Paniagua, who was the centre-left party's head in the
town of Jaltenango de la Paz, was shot several times as he cycled to a
school where he was a teacher.
The shooting followed several days of growing unrest in Chiapas, where PRD
supporters have protested at the results of the state's gubernatorial
election on August 21. The PRD claims its candidate won the race but that
the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party was given the victory
because of massive electoral fraud.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Money 'no problem' for population policies: World Bank chief
says meeting the Dollars 17bn UN target is 'not the main issue'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The World Bank has dismissed fears that lack of funding will prove a serious
obstacle to the policies agreed at the global conference on population and
development in Cairo.
As delegates become optimistic about reaching consensus on abortion, the
issue which has dominated proceedings, their concerns are switching to the
question of money. Mr Lewis Preston, the bank's president, said that meeting
the United Nations target of Dollars 17bn (Pounds 11bn) a year by 2000 was
'not the main issue'. Better use of resources and improving women's
education were greater problems, he argued.
Last year the bank spent Dollars 2bn on women's education, and Dollars 200m
on family planning. It expects to spend 50 per cent more on family planning
over the next three years. Mr Preston warned that developing countries would
probably have to find two-thirds of the Dollars 17bn total themselves, as
the UN's draft policy document recommends. This implies that developing
countries' current level of spending on family planning - some Dollars 5bn a
year - must more than double by 2000.
Although Mr Preston argued that Dollars 5bn amounted to less than 5 per cent
of military spending in developing countries, the likelihood of a sharp
increase in spending on family planning has been greeted with scepticism by
women's groups.
'It is unrealistic to think that these governments will prefer to spend
money on women's education rather than the latest aircraft technology,' said
one woman from a Moslem country, who asked not to be named. 'They even find
it humiliating to have someone suggest that they can't afford the latest
western military gadgets because they still have all these ignorant women
running around,' she added.
Against a background of such concerns, developed countries have announced
sharp increases in spending. Germany has indicated it may spend some Dollars
2bn by 2000. Mr Yohei Kono, Japanese foreign affairs minister, also told the
conference Japan would provide funds for family planning 'towards a targeted
sum' of Dollars 3bn between 1994 and 2000. He said this would be
co-ordinated with the Dollars 9bn he expected the US to spend in that
period.
However, Mr Brian Attwood, administrator of the US Agency for International
Development, said 'this is not a pledging conference' and that talks of
precise sums was inappropriate.
The US will spend Dollars 585m in the year to September 1995 - a sharp
increase from spending on family planning under the Reagan and Bush
administrations, which were determined that US funds should not be in any
way connected with programmes involving abortion.
In Japan's case, the increase reflects its sensitivity to allegations it has
in the past contributed relatively little to international development
programmes.
UN agencies such as the UN Population Fund and the World Health Organisation
 -now headed by a Japanese - have found themselves grateful recipients of
increases in Japanese contributions while other industrialised countries
have cut back. About 10 per cent of US and Japanese spending on family
planning will be diverted through UN agencies, delegates said.

<TEXT>
Nigeria's minister of justice said yesterday his ministry was not party to
controversial new laws giving the military rulers sweeping powers of arrest,
Paul Adams and Reuter report from Lagos.
'The ministry has to clear the air in that it has no knowledge, no copy or
any information about the promulgation of these decrees which sweep away our
liberties,' Mr Olu Onagoruwa, the justice minister and attorney general,
told a news conference. He said it was possible he would resign over the
issue.
The three new decrees have extended the powers of Nigeria's military regime
to suppress civilian opposition, after the collapse this week of a two-month
strike by oil workers demanding that Gen Sani Abacha hand over power to the
jailed presidential candidate Mr Moshood Abiola.
They strip the law courts of the power to challenge the government's
authority, extend the term for detention without charges from six weeks to
three months and proscribe three independent daily newspapers.

The Indian government yesterday approved 32 proposals for foreign direct

introduction of its reform programme in 1991 to more than Rs164bn, Shiraz
Sidhva reports from New Delhi. A Finance Ministry committee, which had
cleared the proposals, said in a statement that some of the investments had
projected export earnings of nearly Rs7bn over a period of five years.
Projects include the establishment of a holding company, BPL Finance, by
Sanyo Electric of Japan and its Indian partner, BPL Electronics.
Sanyo's clearance comes two weeks after a fully owned manufacturing and
marketing venture by another Japanese electronic giant, Sony, was approved.

President Nelson Mandela yesterday appealed to South African workers to curb
their right to strike following a recent spate of industrial stoppages that
threatened the country's development by frightening away foreign investment,
agencies report from Johannesburg.
Mr Mandela, speaking at the national convention of the Congress of South
Africa Trade Unions, said: 'There are at least 5m people who are unemployed,
who don't know where to find food, who don't know where to find a place to
sleep. That is your problem to solve.'
He urged the 1,700 union delegates not to look at their own personal
interest or those of their unions but to 'create conditions where business
can expand' and jobs be created.
Meanwhile, car industry workers streamed back to work yesterday after a
five-week strike. Assembly lines opened in all but one of South Africa's
seven car plants after the union decided to restart pay talks.
Since June there have also been strikes and walkouts in the metal, paper,
mining, oil, and road freight industries. The South African Chamber of
Business has put the cumulative loss of production as a result of recent
strikes at about R3bn (Pounds 535m), or 0.5 per cent of gross domestic
product.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Vatican makes waves at Cairo conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The 17-strong Vatican delegation is among the biggest per capita of any
attending the International Conference on Population and Development, given
UN figures putting Vatican City population at 1,000. By yesterday fuming
delegates from many countries felt that the Holy See was wielding
disproportionate influence in the conference proceedings.
While top diplomats and career lobbyists grudgingly marvelled at the
Vatican's discipline and tenacity in holding up consensus on the
conference's critical text on abortion, many also asked if it was
appropriate to have a religion represented at a convocation of nation
states.
'If they are here, the Buddhists, the Moslems and the Hindus should be here;
they have no right being here,' a European diplomat said.
Such views were being widely voiced. 'The Vatican is the only state in the
world that has no children and no mothers, but still it has been able to
hold up all the rest of the countries in agreeing this important document,'
one UN official said.
'Does the Vatican rule the world?' asked an exasperated Mr Maher Mahran,
Egypt's population minister. 'If they are not going to negotiate, why did
they come?'
In response, Vatican officials said they had every right to be at the
conference as they were among the world's biggest providers of health care,
through almost 100,000 clinics and hospitals. 'We may not be a traditional
nation state, but we're the only organisation here with responsibilities
worldwide,' said one delegate.
Critics argued, however, that unlike all other states which have to govern
people with health problems and formulate population policies, the Vatican
was in Cairo principally to defend the tenets of a religion.
Abortion, mentioned no more than a dozen times in the 133-page draft text
intended to offer a broad developmental approach to global population
stabilisation, is anathema to the Catholic faith. Terms such as 'safe
abortion' cannot be squared with a faith for which every abortion is the
ending of a human life.
Indeed, one Holy See delegate admitted that, above all, the Vatican wanted
to prevent any possibility that the final Cairo declaration could be open to
interpretation as offering an internationally sanctioned right to abortion.
The Vatican's critics have vehemently argued that no such right is sought,
but rather the right of women to have access to 'safe, effective, humane
health care,' to quote the World Health Organisation, and an acceptance that
since the occurrence of abortion is an unassailable fact, governments should
'deal forthrightly with unsafe abortion as a major public health concern,'
to quote the contested draft text.
But in haggling over the uneasy mesh of theological and UN conference
terminology, the Holy See has proved a tough belligerent.
As Ms Francis Kissling, president of Catholics for Free Choice, put it:
'They're good - they're intelligent, suave, sophisticated, tenacious. These
people have been doing diplomacy for 1,500 years. This is the former Holy
Roman Empire we're dealing with: they've made and unmade kings.'
Some diplomats said the Vatican's strength also derived from having placed
effective representatives within national delegations. 'They are in with
Malta, Guatemala: you don't know where they are,' a European official
declared.
The Vatican is additionally seen to be ably led, by Archbishop Renato
Martino, the Holy See's observer at the UN, whom one official characterised
reverently as 'the most brilliant Vatican negotiator in the world'. Bishop
James McHugh, bishop of New Jersey and chief interlocutor with the US, has
also won grudging admiration.
By last night, the Vatican had managed to keep at least 10 allied states
from falling in behind the abortion text.
Many (Baroness Chalker, head of the UK delegation among them) felt that the
Vatican and these states should simply state their objections and allow the
conference to move on: 'If they're going to enter a reservation but not
wreck the conference, surely they should enter one now.'
The Holy See's representatives vehemently deny they intend to wreck the
conference, but some other delegates believe the Vatican's intransigence in
Cairo may weaken its position in future world gatherings.
'They have seriously overplayed their hand,' says Ms Kissling, who cites a
string of polls indicating that most faithful in a host of Catholic
countries have long since forsaken Papal edicts on family planning.
