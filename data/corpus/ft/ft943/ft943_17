FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Sharp drop at Western Mining
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Western Mining Corporation, the Australian mining group, yesterday reported
an equity-consolidated profit, after tax but before abnormal items, of
ADollars 119.7m (USDollars 89m) in the year to end-June.
This compared with ADollars 165.9m in the previous year, a fall of 27.8 per
cent.
WMC took a large abnormal charge in 1992-93, of ADollars 113.3m before tax,
while the net charge in 1993-94 was ADollars 700,000. As a result, WMC's
equity profit after tax and abnormals was sharply improved, to ADollars 125m
in the year just ended, compared with ADollars 88.3m previously.
This figure was in line with the profits forecast made by WMC in its rights
issue prospectus last month.
The fall in Western's pre-abnormal profits derived largely from an 18.4 per
cent drop in operating earnings, to ADollars 127.8m. Total revenue was 7.6
per cent higher at ADollars 1.7bn.
On a divisional basis, WMC's nickel operations remained in the red, although
the loss was reduced to ADollars 23.2m from ADollars 284m.
The company noted that this improvement came despite a 14 per cent decline
in US dollar terms for the overall price of nickel, and the production
interruptions as the upgrading of facilities took place.
The Olympic Dam business contributed ADollars 60.2m, against ADollars 47.4m,
but the advance was largely due to WMC's increasing its ownership of the
operations to 100 per cent.
Higher production, coupled with an improved gold price, meant that the
Australian gold interests made ADollars 74.2m, up from ADollars 38.5m.
However, the North and South American gold interests produced a loss of
ADollars 16m.
The main depressant on profits was the petroleum division, which turned in
profits of ADollars 4.7m, compared with ADollars 43.7m in the previous year.
A lower oil price, declining production from a couple of fields, and an
increase in unit costs due to higher amoritisation/depletion charges did the
damage.
WMC's share of after-tax profits from Alcoa of Australia, in which it has a
48.25 per cent stake, also fell, by 17.6 per cent to ADollars 147.3m. This
was largely due to lower US dollar prices and lower aluminium sales volumes.
However, Mr Hugh Morgan, WMC's managing director, held out the prospect of a
better year ahead.
The final dividend is 4 cents a share, down from 7 cents last time, making 8
cents for the year, against 10 cents last time.

persists

Speculation about a possible takeover of the NBC television network
continued yesterday after a senior NBC executive stopped short of issuing an
outright denial of reports that General Electric, NBC's parent group, has
been considering selling all or part of the network to Time Warner.
Mr Robert Wright, president of NBC, would only say that a report that NBC
and Time Warner had been negotiating a sale of the network for Dollars 2.5bn
was not accurate.
A spokesman for Time Warner, meanwhile, said the group would not comment on
the story.
Mr Wright's comments failed to dampen takeover speculation on Wall Street,
which has been buzzing with rumours about upheaval in the US network
television market.
The latest talk of a NBC takeover was accompanied by reports that Walt
Disney has been negotiating to buy the CBS network, which earlier this year
failed to merge with the QVC television home-shopping company.
The takeover rumours lifted GE and CBS's share prices yesterday, even though
most leading stocks on Wall Street were lower. GE climbed Dollars  1/2 to
Dollars 50 1/4 , and CBS rose Dollars 11 1/8 to Dollars 332 1/2 , while Time
Warner fell Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 38. Disney closed unchanged.

<TEXT>
MCI , the US long distance telephone company, has ended talks with Nextel
Communications about co-operating in the creation of a new US-wide wireless
communications service without reaching agreement, the companies said.
Last week, MCI cancelled plans to acquire a 17 per cent stake in Nextel for
Dollars 1.3bn in cash, but the companies said they would continue talks
aimed at forming a strategic alliance on different terms. MCI said its
discussions with Nextel had been positive, but any new transaction would
have required Motorola's consent and that MCI and Motorola were unable to
reach agreement on terms.
Motorola is a Nextel shareholder, with a stake of about 20 per cent in the
wireless communications company.
MCI's withdrawal is a setback for Nextel, which has announced plans to build
a US-wide service offering voice and data communications, two-way paging and
radio dispatch services. The telephone company was to been Nextel's
marketing partner.
Since February, when MCI signed a letter of intent with Nextel, Nextel's
share price has fallen sharply. Analysts said that MCI may have been
renegotiating the price it agreed to pay for Nextel shares.

FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Canadian banks ahead sharply in
third period
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Canada's two biggest banks posted sharply higher third quarter earnings,
driven by strong lending activity, rising fee income, tight expense control
and lower loan losses.
Royal Bank of Canada's net profit for the July quarter was CDollars 294m
(USDollars 213m), or 80 cents a share, an increase of 32 per cent on the
CDollars 223m, or 38 cents, a year earlier. Return on assets was up at 0.70
per cent, against 0.62 per cent and on equity rose to 16.5 per cent from
11.7 per cent.
Nine-month profit was CDollars 867m, or CDollars 2.36, an advance of 20 per
cent from CDollars 720m, or CDollars 1.93. Return on assets was 0.70 per
cent compared with 0.69 per cent and on equity 16.9 per cent against 13.4
per cent.
Non-performing loans dropped 24 per cent to CDollars 1.8bn at July 31 while
the loan-loss provision for fiscal 1994 is CDollars 820m against CDollars
1.75bn in fiscal 1993.
The trust and investment-brokerage units improved. At July 31 assets
totalled CDollars 172bn, up 2 per cent year-on-year.
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said third-quarter net profit was
CDollars 223m, or 87 cents, ahead 17 per cent from a year earlier. Return on
assets was 0.58 per cent, against 0.55 per cent, and on equity 11.5 per
cent, up from 10.5 per cent.
Nine-months earnings were CDollars 654m, or CDollars 2.59, an increase of 21
per cent from CDollars 539m, or CDollars 2.24.
Total revenues rose 11 per cent with strong business and consumer lending,
while investments and brokerage activities were ahead. Net interest income
was up 4 per cent and other income ahead 11 per cent.
Non-performing loans continued to decline, to CDollars 1.7bn at July 31,
while fiscal 1994 loan provision was unchanged at CDollars 880m. Total
assets reached CDollars 152.5bn, up 9 per cent year-on-year.
Boise Cascade, the US forest products group, is going ahead this month with
an initial public offering of Rainy River Forest Products, a Canadian
subsidiary holding all the newsprint assets.
Rainy River, with two mills in Canada and one in the US, will have annual
sales of more than USDollars 350m and rank among North America's top 10
producers of newsprint and groundwood papers.
Boise Cascade expects to raise CDollars 420m by selling units of Rainy
River, comprising common shares and convertible debentures.
Boise Cascade will also raise USDollars 110m with an institutional issue of
secured notes.

group

<TEXT>
Lauritzen Holding, the Danish shipping and shipbuilding group, suffered a
first-half net loss of DKr198m (Dollars 32m), compared with a first-half
loss last year of DKr73m.
The group takes in the J Lauritzen Shipping Group, DFDS, the North Sea
freight and ferry group, and the Danyard shipyard.
Sales were up to DKr4.89bn from DKr4.33bn, but the result was hit by a rise
in net financial costs to DKr230m from DKr142m and a DKr54m loss on the
disposal of vessels.
The J Lauritzen Company made a loss of DKr289m, against a loss of DKr118m.
The company's fleet of refrigerated cargo vessels was hurt by low freight
rates and the weakness of the dollar against the krone.
The holding company said it has increased the shipping company's capital by
issuing subordinated loan capital of DKr150m.
The shipyard also moved into a loss of DKr42m, compared with a profit of
DKr66m.
The group has predicted a full-year loss of the same order as in 1993, when
there was a net deficit of DKr178m.
FLS Industries, the industrial conglomerate which is a leading global
supplier of cement mills and machinery, has reported an increase in
first-half net profits to DKr176m from DKr126m in the same period of last
year.
Sales advanced to DKr6.45bn from DKr5.6bn, which was mainly a reflection of
the domestic building materials group Aalborg Portland being classified as a
subsidiary rather than as an associate company.
Codan, Denmark's biggest non-life insurance group, recorded a first-half net
loss of DKr146m, against a profit in the same period last year of DKr503m.
Profits from insurance activities improved to DKr157m from a loss last year
of DKr163m, but there were unrealised losses on securities of DKr303m this
year against unrealised gains last year of DKr66m.

FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Telefonica rises 4.7% to Pta52bn
at halfway stage
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Telefonica, the state-controlled Spanish telecommunications group and the
biggest company on the Madrid stock exchange, lifted first-half consolidated
net profits by 4.7 per cent to Pta52bn (Dollars 397m) on the back of
increased demand, lower financial charges and increasing international
business.
The increased group profits reflected in particular the performance of
Telefonica Internacional (Tisa) which has invested strongly in acquiring
Latin American telecommunications companies. Talks are taking place that aim
to bring both GTE and Unisource into Tisa as large shareholders.
Results at the Telefonica parent company were up by just 1.7 per cent to
Pta44.8bn, in spite of a 6.5 per cent rise in operating income and a 7 per
cent fall in financial charges.
Analysts believe the parent company could be keeping its net profits low to
prod government regulators into raising tariff charges.
Improved first-half results, reflecting the incipient domestic recovery,
were also posted by Iberdrola, the private sector electrical utility, and by
Tabacalera, the government-controlled tobacco manufacturer and distributor.
Iberdrola reported a 96 per cent jump in its net profits over the first six
months of the year to Pta49.7bn but this sharp increase included
extraordinary income of Pta25.2bn realised through the disposal of its
Barcelona-based subsidiary, Hidroelectrica de Cataluna, to the
state-controlled utility Endesa.
Iberdrola's net profits, without this extraordinary item, rose by 11.7 per
cent due to energy demand, lower expenditure and an 18 per cent fall in
financial charges brought about by falling interest rates and reduced
borrowing.
Tabacalera, which is 52 per cent state-owned, raised its net first half
group profits by 32.5 per cent to Pta5.7bn.
The increase was due to extraordinary income of Pta2.5bn realised through
the disposal of its food division Royal Brands to Nabisco of the US, to a 54
per cent drop in financial charges and a 23 per cent rise in tobacco sales.
The sharp jump in sales was largely due to government action in curbing
cigarette smuggling.

FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Wallenbergs give a lesson in
invisibility The empire is held in a strong hand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A visitor to Stockholm intent on seeking out Europe's premier industrial
dynasty would soon discover something striking about the Wallenberg empire.
It has no headquarters, no annual report and no corporate logo.
This public invisibility stands in stark contrast to the glittering list of
Swedish blue-chip companies which the Wallenberg family controls such as
Asea, Electrolux, Ericsson, Astra, Stora, Saab-Scania and SKF.
But it is a key to understanding the way in which the Wallenbergs operate.
They deliberately adopt a low-profile approach, shunning the limelight and
avoiding a jet-set lifestyle. When they take to the water it is to sail in
Stockholm's archipelago rather than to cruise in luxury yachts off the Cote
d'Azur. Their style is summed up in the family motto 'Esse Non Vidare' - To
Be, Not To Be Seen.
Their empire is a collection of widely disparate companies gathered under
the same umbrella but controlled most often through minority shareholdings.
It is the identities of the individual companies which are promoted rather
than the common ownership.
However, the invisibility belies the strong hold exercised by the family,
headed by Peter Wallenberg, and a circle of trusted lieutenants over a
fiefdom accounting for 40 per cent of the value of the Stockholm Stock
Exchange.
'They will always be strong owners. They want to control their companies,
they want to make the decisions,' says a former Wallenberg director.
This rule through a close-knit network which acts as a kind of super-board
has been the Wallenbergs' traditional way of managing the empire.
It operates largely informally through frequent meetings in offices of the
key companies scattered around Stockholm's handsome waterfront, through
daily telephone calls between the main protagonists and through a regular
round of discreet social gatherings.
At the pinnacle stands Peter Wallenberg, aged 68. Alongside him in what the
former director calls 'an inner, inner circle', are his anointed dual heirs,
his son Jacob and his nephew Marcus, both in their late 30s.
Today, the other key members of the network include Bo Berggren, chairman of
Stora, Anders Scharp, chairman of Electrolux, Claes Dahlback, chief
executive of Investor, the family's core holding company, and Bjorn
Svedberg, chairman of Ericsson and chief executive of Skandinaviska Enskilda
Banken, the family bank.
Another insider is Percy Barnevik, the chief executive of Asea Brown Boveri,
the Swiss-Swedish engineering group which the Wallenberg's half control.
However, he appears to play a more independent role, holding chairmanships
of Swedish companies outside the Wallenberg sphere.
All this group, with the exception of Bjorn Svedberg, sit on the board of
Investor, which Peter Wallenberg chairs. But they also meet in overlapping
combinations, with one of them usually acting as chairman, across the core
Wallenberg companies.
The system is perfectly suited to providing a sheltered habitat within which
Peter is grooming Jacob and Marcus to succeed him. They have moved up from
lower level jobs within the empire, inside and outside Sweden, to senior
executive positions, respectively, in SE-Banken and Investor, and to assume
their first board positions.
Peter Wallenberg says the cousins will take over when he decides they are
ready. He is using the network to give Jacob and Marcus the chance to gain
experience precisely in the way he was denied by his father, who denigrated
Peter's abilities.
Members of the network say it provides a valuable cross-fertilisation of
views and strategic guidance for individual companies. But they insist this
is distinct from unwarranted interference in day-to-day manage-ment, which
is left to the executives running the companies.
The Wallenbergs certainly pride themselves in having fostered successive
generations of loyal managements who have had the backing to produce
long-term results.
One is Ericsson, the telecommunications group, where management under chief
executive Lars Ramqvist spent heavily on research and development in the
early 1990s - more than 20 per cent of turnover - at the expense of
dividends. The pay-off has been Ericsson's present success, especially in
mobile telephony.
The network also provides an invaluable service to individual companies,
providing access to the Wallenbergs' extensive international business,
political and academic contacts.
Peter Wallenberg sits, for example, on Swiss Bank Corp's international
advisory board and GM's European advisory council. Similar prestige posts
are held by all the inner circle.
These contacts were put to spectacular use in 1991 when Jacob Wallenberg led
a move by Investor to raise a Dollars 1.5bn unsecured syndicated bank loan
to fund Investor's buy-out of Saab-Scania.
'Do you think you'd get that out of the major banks without having a
particular reputation?' says Peter Wallenberg.
But the other side of the coin is the concern that the network is too
incestuous and is there mainly to support decision-making by the family.
'When it comes to strategy it is a question in the end for Peter Wallenberg
to make the decisions, and he does,' says a former insider. 'The others are
just advisers.'
Key issues, he says, are worked out before board meetings by the inner
circle.
Some critics worry that the network system ultimately stifles initiative.
'In every such constellation, there is a danger they are protecting each
other,' says Per Olof Edin, chief economist at the LO trade union
federation.
The network to date has certainly tended to resist outside intrusions. In
1990, the Wallenbergs responded to a demand for a seat on Saab-Scania's
board by Sven Olof Johansson, a corporate raider who had built up a 22 per
cent stake, by buying him out.
Today there is a striking discrepancy between the virtual absence of
foreigners on Wallenberg company boards and the fact that as much as 50 per
cent of the capital of individual companies is held by foreign investors.
This is not a pressing issue now because no single interest has built up a
significant voting stake in any company. But it could become so as the spate
of foreign buying of Swedish shares unleashed by deregulation continues
unabated.
This is the second article in a three-part series on the Wallenbergs. The
first appeared yesterday.

FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: VW and Ford loosen links in
Autolatina
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Soaring Brazilian car production and increasing rivalry between dealers has
forced Ford and Volkswagen to loosen their links in Autolatina, the holding
company for their joint operations in Brazil and Argentina.
The companies will no longer produce similar-looking vehicles from common
production platforms, but instead use the world platforms of their parent
companies. However, they have not confirmed local media reports that
Autolatina will be disbanded.
Autolatina plans to produce the Fiesta model locally because of the growing
Brazilian market for small cars. The company intends to invest Dollars 400m
in the venture by the end of next year.
Autolatina was formed in 1987 during a period of low production and
investment in Brazil's car industry.
Recent growth and the opening of Brazil's economy led to the decision to use
world platforms, according to company president Mr Pierre-Alain de Smedt.
Pressure from VW dealers, reluctant to share the platform for the new Golf
model with Ford, also contributed.
Mr de Smedt said Ford and VW would have more autonomy within Autolatina but
the holding company would continue in areas such as purchasing,
administration and legal services.
The Brazilian car market has been recovering since 1992 thanks to pacts
between the industry and the government, which reduced vehicle taxes.

<TEXT>
Brambles, the Australian transportation group, yesterday announced a
ADollars 233.2m (USDollars 171.4m) loss after tax and abnormal items for the
year to end-June, a sharp reversal from the previous year's ADollars 166.1m
profit.
The damage was done by a ADollars 378.1m abnormal charge, already reported
in the first-half and mainly due to the write-off of goodwill at Brambles'
US-based waste management operation, Ensco.
The company said there were no abnormal items in the second half.
Operating profits before abnormals and tax for the year were ADollars 242m,
slightly below the previous year's ADollars 259.2m. Brambles said, however,
that second-half results were in line with expectations and it had 'reached
a turning point'.
Revenues were little changed at ADollars 2.74bn, against ADollars 2.71bn.

FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Speculation on NBC TV bid
persists

<TEXT>
Speculation about a possible takeover of the NBC television network
continued yesterday after a senior NBC executive stopped short of issuing an
outright denial of reports that General Electric, NBC's parent group, has
been considering selling all or part of the network to Time Warner.
Mr Robert Wright, president of NBC, would only say that a report that NBC
and Time Warner had been negociating a sale of the network for eollars 2.5bn
was not accurate. A spokesman for Time Warner, meanwhile, said that the
group would not comment on the story.
Mr Wright's comments failed to dampen takeover speculation on Wall Street,
which has been buzzing with rumours about upheavel in the US network
television market.
The latest talk of a NBC takeover was accompanied by reports that Walt
Disney has been negociating to buy the CBS network, which earlier this year
failed to merge with the QVC television home-shopping company.
The takeover rumours lifted GE and CBS's share prices yesterday, even though
most leading stocks on Wall Street were lower. GE climbed Dollars 1/2 to
Dollars 50 1/4 and CBS rose Dollars s 6 5/8 to Dollars 328, while Time
Warner fell 6. 1/8 to 37 7/8 and Disney fell Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 41.
This is not the first time GE is reported to have been discussing selling
NBC, which it bought in 1986 as part of the Dollars 63bn acquisition of RCA
Corporation.
On previous occasions, Mr Jack Welch, GE president, had insisted the network
was not for sale, most recently last November. Yesterday, there was no
comment from Mr Welch.
Although Mr Welch has said he wanted NBC to remain part of GE, the
diversified industrial group is believed to be unhappy with the network's
recent performance.
NBC's revenues last year were down from 1993 levels, it has had the lowest
ratings of the big three networks for the past three years and has suffered
a string of recent mishaps, including a staged accident in a television news
report on General Motors pick-up trucks.
If Time Warner is interested in buying NBC, it is understandable, given that
the entertainment group is eager to develop its television interests and is
preparing to launch its own broadcast network
Any deal between GE and Time Warner over NBC would run into regulatory
problems. Certain limits are placed on cross-ownership of broadcast and
cable TV interests and Time Warner has extensive cable TV operations.

FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Net income up 2% at Sandoz in
first half

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sandoz, the Swiss pharmaceu-ticals, nutrition and chemicals group that has
just acquired Gerber Food Products of the US for Dollars 3.7bn, raised net
income 2 per cent in the first half to SFr1.01bn (Dollars 760m).
Operating income grew a faster 7 per cent to SFr1.36bn on sales up 2 per
cent to SFr8.2bn, 8 per cent higher in local currencies. But the net
financial result tumbled from a SFr79m profit to a SFr90m loss because of
price declines of securities held.
Sandoz expected sales trends in leading markets to remain favourable in the
second half and operating income to 'continue its upward path'.
Gerber would be consolidated from August 25. Mr Raymund Breu, Sandoz finance
director, said the baby food group would add Dollars 410m to group sales and
Dollars 70m to operating income this year. At net income level, it would
have no effect this year or in 1995.
Group volume growth was 4.6 per cent in the first half, with a 10 per cent
rise from agricultural chemicals, 5 per cent from construction and 4 per
cent from both pharmaceuticals and nutrition divisions.
Prices were squeezed, so the improvement in the operating margin from 15.9
per cent to 16.5 per cent came from volume and cost improvements.
Sales of the pharmaceuticals division were down 1 per cent to SFr3.59bn,
reflecting government enforced price cuts in some countries and the strong
Swiss franc.
Sales of the nutrition division soared 29 per cent to SFr1.15bn, largely as
a result of acquisitions last year.
Sales in the chemicals and environment sector were flat at SFr2.76bn, with
gains in agriculture and construction offsetting an 8 per cent slide in
chemical sales, especially those to textile and paper makers.

FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Leyland Trucks plans first big
investment

<TEXT>
Dutch and UK truck companies created out of the collapse of the Daf group
last year are increasing their profits and making a first significant
investment in a new range.
Leyland Trucks Manufacturing, the UK truck maker rescued by a management
buy-out last year, says it will spend Pounds 25m (Dollars 38.25m) to design
and develop a medium-sized truck range to be built at its Leyland,
Lancashire, headquarters. Most of the new vehicles will be for delivery to
Daf Trucks, the Dutch truck maker also revived - with Dutch and Belgian
government finance - from the Daf collapse.
The UK company has a long-term contract with the revived Dutch manufacturer
under which Daf Trucks sells and services all Leyland-produced trucks in
Europe.
The announcement came as Daf Trucks reported a net profit for the first half
of Fl 39.2m (Dollars 22m) on turnover of Fl 924.2m. Daf in March reported a
net profit of only Fl 10.8m in a truncated first financial year.

FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: AST loss forecast prompts PC
concerns

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A warning from AST Research, the world's fifth largest personal computer
maker, that it expected to report a net loss this quarter has prompted
increased concerns about a possible slowing of growth in PC sales.
Computer sector stocks declined, reflecting Wall Street's nervousness about
the outlook for PC sales.
At the close of trade yesterday, AST was down sharply by Dollars 4 15/16 at
Dollars 13 1/16 , a 27 per cent decline. Compaq Computer, the PC market
leader, was off Dollars 2 1/2 at Dollars 34 7/8 , while Apple Computer
shares declined by Dollars 1 3/16 to Dollars 35 and IBM was trading at
Dollars 67 7/8 , down Dollars  3/4 .
AST said delays in new products and sharp price cuts by Compaq, IBM and
Digital Equipment would result in a loss for the first quarter ending
October 2 and break-even results in the second quarter.
'We have encountered several unanticipated product development delays,
component constraints and delivery issues,' said Mr Safi Qureshey, chairman
and chief executive.
Price cuts by competitors have forced AST to make 'significant price
reductions on existing products to protect market share, as well as new
product introductions which will have to be priced more aggressively than
originally planned', he added.
A month ago, AST reported record results for fiscal 1994, claiming sales
growth of four times the industry average. Revenues for the year were
Dollars 2.4bn, up from Dollars 1.4bn in 1993. Net income was Dollars 53.5m,
or Dollars 1.59 a share, compared with a net loss after restructuring
charges of Dollars 53.7m or Dollars 1.72 a share in 1993.
Rumours that Compaq, the PC market leader, was trimming orders for
components also fuelled concerns about the outlook for sales.
But Dataquest, a market research firm, yesterday reiterated its forecast
that worldwide PC sales will reach 45m units this year, a 16.3 per cent
increase over 1993.

FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: BASF moves drugs divisions
toward generics
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BASF, the German chemicals group, is attempting to revive the fortunes of
its Knoll pharmaceuticals division by diversifying into non-patented generic
drugs in the German market.
A new distribution and marketing company, BASF Generics, will start
operating next year with the aim of generating DM100m (Dollars 63.3m) in
sales before the end of the decade, the company said yesterday.
Talks are also under way with potential partners, indicating further moves,
possibly into other markets, are likely.
Knoll recently bought the rights to around 80 out-of-patent drugs from Hexal
Pharma, one of Germany's leading generics makers.
It also took an option on a further 80 which are expected to be licensed for
use in Germany in the near future.
The creations of BASF Generics is the biggest step yet in a strategy
developed at the end of last year, when Knoll reported its first loss, of
DM6m on sales of DM2bn, and ordered a 15 per cent cut in its workforce.
Germany is the fastest-growing and largest market for non-patented generic
medicines in Europe, accounting for nearly 40 per cent of the Dollars 4.85bn
market, according to a recent report*.
In 1992, about 29 per cent of all prescriptions dispensed in Germany were
generic drugs. The German generic market then was worth about DM2.67bn,
accounting for about 22 per cent of all prescription drugs sales.
BASF is the last of Germany's big three chemical groups to gain a foothold
in generics.
In March, Bayer spent Dollars 130m on a 28.3 per cent stake in Schein, a
privately-owned US group. That followed last year's Dollars 546m purchase by
Hoechst of a 51 per cent stake in Copley Pharmaceuticals, another US
company.
Earlier this year US group Bristol-Myers Squibb acquired a 25 per cent stake
in Azupharma, a German generics subsidiary of Gehe. In June, Merck announced
its intention to acquire a 51 per cent stake in Amerpharm, an international
generics company based in the Netherlands.

<TEXT>
Eastern Germany's largest electricity utility and its biggest brown coal
field have been sold to a consortium headed by RWE Energie, the German
utility, the Treuhand privatisation agency announced yesterday.
The sale, which will be officially sealed next week, paves the way for a
DM41bn (Dollars 27.3bn) investment programme by west Germany utilities in
eastern Germany's energy sector. It also secures a future for brown coal,
despite the environmental costs, and particularly in an election year when
unemployment in eastern Germany is one of the key issues.
Although the Treuhand will not confirm the selling price until next week,
energy officials yesterday said RWE, PreussenElektra and Bayernwerk paid
about DM8bn for Veag, eastern Germany's largest utility. The former state
utility, which enjoyed a monopoly under the former communist regime, had a
workforce of 29,000. That has been reduced to 14,500, and is expected to
fall further.
A consortium led by Rheinbraun, RWE's brown coal offshoot, and including
Preussen-Elektra and Bayernwerk, bought the Laubag brown coal fields for an
initial payment of DM2.1bn and a commitment to invest more than DM6bn over
the next 20 years.
Laubag, which now employs less than 12,000, compared to more than 60,000
before German unification, will fuel most of Veag's 12,300-megawatt
capacity. Annual coal production will total about 55m tonnes, which is
considered the minimum for the fields' economic viability.
However, the long-term economic prospects for Laubag and Veag will depend on
the consortia's ability to withstand increasing pressure from the expanding
gas market and falling energy consumption in eastern Germany. Gas is quickly
becoming a substitute for brown coal.

<TEXT>
Mercedes-Benz, the world's leading truck maker, is planning to invest more
than DM5bn (Dollars 3.16bn) in the research and development of new
commercial vehicles between 1994 to 1998, Mr Helmut Werner, chief executive,
said yesterday.
The group will launch two van ranges in Europe next year, and introduce a
new-generation heavy truck range in 1996.
Mercedes-Benz is embarking on an aggressive expansion of its light
commercial vehicle operations in Europe, with the aim of increasing its van
production capacity by between 40 and 50 per cent during the next two years,
to around 150,000 a year from 100,000 in 1994.
It also plans to internationalise its light commercial vehicle operations.
It wants to start producing in South America, Mr Bernd Gottschalk, managing
director of the commercial vehicle division, said yesterday.
The new T1 medium-weight van range (2.5-4.6 tonnes gross vehicle weight) to
be launched in Europe next year will also be produced in Argentina, starting
in 1996.
In Europe, the capacity for this vehicle is being increased from around
75,000 to 100,000, competing with rivals such as the Ford Transit and the
Volkswagen Transporter.
In Argentina, Mercedes-Benz will build toward capacity of between 20,000 and
25,000 units a year, enough to supply the Brazilian market as well.
The group has begun negotiations on two ambitious joint ventures in China
for the production of heavy trucks and buses and coaches, said Mr Werner.
It has entered a feasibility study with Yangzhou Motor Coach Manufacturing
(YMC), the biggest Chinese bus and coach producer, for the formation of a
joint venture. The target here will be the production of up to 12,000 bus
chassis and 6,000 large coaches a year.
Such an operation would exceed Mercedes-Benz's existing Brazilian bus and
coach operations, which produced 14,600 vehicles last year. It would also be
twice as big as its European bus and coach operations in Germany and Turkey.
Separately, it is investigating the formation of a joint venture to produce
heavy trucks (above 15 tonnes) in China with its current licensee partner,
Norinco.

FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Olivetti chief seeks to allay
investor fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Corrado Passera, chief executive of Olivetti, yesterday sought to
reassure shareholders and the market about the financial and industrial
health of the Italian computer group. His assurances come at the end of a
week in which the value of their investment has fallen by almost 10 per
cent.
Mr Passera replied point by point to market rumours which led to a 5 per
cent fall in the share price on Wednesday.
Olivetti reports half-year results later this month, and the chief executive
said the group expected to be able to confirm earlier forecasts that it
would break even at operating level this year. He said revenues had risen by
7 per cent in the first six months.
Olivetti's shares were reasonably stable yesterday, slipping slightly to
close at L2,115 against an opening price of L2,123. That, however, compares
with L2,347 at last Wednesday's close, before Digital Equipment, the
troubled US computer company, revealed it had gradually sold its 8 per cent
stake in Olivetti on the market during the slack holiday period.
Although the two companies are maintaining technological and product links,
the announcement was taken as an indication that they had finally abandoned
the ambitious partnership set up in 1992. It has also put Olivetti's fragile
recovery under the market spotlight.
Mr Passera conceded yesterday that Digital's decision to sell 100m shares
into a difficult market created an overhang of Olivetti stock, 'which was
bound to reflect on the share price'. However, he pointed out that the way
in which the shares were quickly swallowed by the market was 'a further
demonstration of the strong liquidity of our stock'.
Analysts are still puzzled, however, by the delayed reaction to the Digital
news, and believe the market may also have taken into account a number of
other unsettling elements, including:
the personal computer price war in the US. On the same day as the Digital
announcement, International Business Machines launched a price-cutting
effort in response to Compaq Computer's price reductions. Mr Passera pointed
out yesterday that PCs represented only 20 per cent of Olivetti's L8,600bn
(Dollars 5.7bn) annual turnover (more than 60 per cent of group sales come
from the systems and services activities), and that the average price
reduction on PCs was about 12 per cent - 'not far from what we foresaw in
our budget and linked to a drop in component prices and to efficiency
improvements'.
extraordinary losses on share and bond investments. Mr Passera admitted that
in 1994 the group's fixed-interest portfolio had suffered a drop in value,
and that investments - held to cope with unexpected restructuring costs -
would suffer a one-off loss.
capital raising. Mr Passera said the group was not expecting to increase its
capital to finance investments in Italy's second cellular telephone network
by the Omnitel-Pronto Italia joint venture, in which Olivetti is the main
shareholder.
Last year Olivetti lost L465bn, compared with a net loss of L650bn in 1992,
but sales increased for the first time since 1990.
At the group's annual shareholder meeting in May, Mr Carlo De Benedetti,
chairman, said Olivetti was 'preparing to reap the benefits of a sweeping
structural reorganisation'.
However, the market's brusque treatment of Olivetti shares this week is a
clear indication to Mr De Benedetti of what will happen if he fails to
deliver on those promises. He probably feels the market's discontent more
than most.
In the last week, shares in the De Benedettis' two quoted holding companies
 -Cir, Olivetti's biggest shareholder, and Cofide, with a large stake in Cir
 -have themselves declined by 10 per cent and 8 per cent respectively.
When the market shakes Olivetti, the whole tree trembles.

FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Volvo takes over German coach
maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Volvo, the Swedish car and commercial vehicle maker, is taking over
Drogmoller, the German bus manufacturer, in a move which accelerates the
rapid concentration of the European bus industry.
Mr Bjorn Larsson, president of Volvo Bus, said the takeover of Drogmoller, a
maker of luxury tourist coaches with a turnover last year of DM56m (Dollars
36m) and a workforce of 250, was an important step in the Swedish group's
effort to break into the German market, which is dominated by Mercedes-Benz
and MAN, the domestic German commercial vehicle makers.
The big European truck and bus makers are moving quickly to consolidate
their hold on the small, and hitherto independent, bus and coach body
builders in Europe, in order to guarantee the outlets for their chassis and
drivelines (engines and gearboxes).
The Volvo acquisition is the latest in a flurry of recent deals, most
notably Mercedes-Benz's takeover of Kassbohrer, the German coach maker which
markets its products under the Setra brand-name.

English &amp; Overseas Properties is to pay its first interim dividend since
1991, after lifting pre-tax profits from Pounds 12,000 to Pounds 353,000 for
the six months to the end of June.
The company, which saw turnover rise from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 1.84m, said
the increase in profits came from two main areas: increased rental income,
both from properties developed by the group and from properties bought last
year, and the sale of an investment property in Gateshead.
Investment properties are now valued at Pounds 26.8m in the balance sheet,
compared with Pounds 1.43m at end-June 1993.
Earnings per share worked through at 0.55p (0.05p); the interim dividend is
0.3p.

The outcome amounted to less than a quarter of the Pounds 1.43m achieved

Turnover of the group, which manufactures continuous ink-jet printers, fell

Turnover dropped 22 per cent from Pounds 33.1m to Pounds 25.7m, largely

FT  02 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Production rise helps Brit-Borneo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 31 per cent rise in production helped British-Borneo, the oil and gas
exploration company, offset lower oil prices and boost net profits for the
six months to the end of June to Pounds 4.36m, a 49 per cent Increase on the
previous Pounds 2.94m.
Earnings per share were 9.7p, also up 49 per cent.
The value of oil and gas sales rose 34 per cent to Pounds 17.5m (Pounds
13.1m), although the average oil price for the period fell from Pounds 12.20
to Pounds 9.84 a barrel.
The company was helped by its strong position in natural gas, especially in
the US, where prices firmed during the first half. Gas accounts for 80 per
cent of British-Borneo's production revenues.
Mr Alan Gaynor, chief executive, said the company was encouraged by its
acquisition earlier this year of a 50 per cent stake in an onshore field in
Cuba, its first big international diversification away from UK and US
markets.
An unchanged interim dividend of 2.667p is declared.

costs

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A good performance from its consumer credit business helped Cattle's
(Holdings) lift interim pre-tax profits, before exceptional items, by 22 per
cent to Pounds 8.45m, against Pounds 6.9m.
However, after taking a Pounds 1.76m charge against the closure of its
lossmaking Swinton insurance franchise operation, the outcome showed a
slight decline to Pounds 6.69m.
Consumer credit turnover rose 11 per cent and contributed Pounds 86.1m
(Pounds 77.8m) to a total of Pounds 104.2m (Pounds 98.7m), an increase of 6
per cent.
Mr Edward Cran, managing director, said that the continued improvement in
the Shopacheck home collected credit business reflected a slow return of
confidence among the group's 260,000 households. Cattle's has an estimated
20 per cent of the weekly collected credit market.
Mr Cran added that the closure of its Swinton operations was likely to be
followed by the run-down of its other non-core activities, such as a small
travel agency business. 'We have positioned ourselves firmly in financial
services and plan to continue this process,' he said.
Earnings per share slid to 3.7p (4.3p). An interim dividend of 2.15p (1.9p)
is declared.

FT  02 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Williams shares aided by upbeat statement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Williams Holdings' shares yesterday recovered from their recent weakness and
jumped 3 per cent to 364p as the fire protection, security and building
products group offered the market an upbeat assessment on trading.
Mr Nigel Rudd, chairman, said Europe was showing better-than-expected
growth, while 'economic indicators for the second half in the UK and North
America continue to be favourable'.
However, he warned that the pace and duration of any economic recovery
remained uncertain.
The market welcomed Mr Rudd's statements as encouraging, but still more
cautious than those being made by other industrial conglomerates. 'They are
at pains to make sure people do not get carried away,' said one analyst.
Mr Rudd's comments came as the group announced a 13 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 86.2m for the six months to June 30. The outcome,
after reorganisation costs of Pounds 4m, were largely in line with
expectations. Sales were 10 per cent ahead to Pounds 648.7m.
Mr Rudd emphasised the group's organic growth, progress on margins, and
improving cashflow. Profits from continuing businesses rose by 18 per cent
to Pounds 98.7m, on sales 13 per cent ahead to Pounds 639m.
Cashflow - for which Williams has often been criticised - was held at
similar levels to last year, before dividends, disposals and acquisitions.
Given the 40 per cent increase in capital expenditure and higher tax, the
underlying cashflow position was better, Mr Rudd said, and was expected to
improve further in the second half.
Williams has bought three businesses since the year-end for Pounds 110m.
Provisions for restructuring the largest acquisition, Solvay, would come to
just over Pounds 5m, leaving Williams with total charges this year estimated
at more than Pounds 9m.
Mr Rudd said the group hoped to use the proceeds of the Pounds 267m rights
issue in May to complete further purchases - particularly in fire protection
and building products - before the end of the year.
Profits at the security division advanced 31 per cent to Pounds 16.5m,
thanks to the Corbin Russwin acquisition.
Fire protection increased profits by 21 per cent to Pounds 25.7m. North
American building products returned a 17 per cent profits advance to Pounds
19.6m, while the European business increased profits by 10 per cent to
Pounds 34.9m.
The interim dividend is increased to 5.25p (5p), payable from basic earnings
per share up 8 per cent to 9p.
Excluding exceptionals, earnings rose by 12 per cent to 9.6p.
COMMENT
The shares jumped today, less on the back of Mr Rudd's guarded optimism than
on the relief that Williams appears to be holding its margins in spite of
higher raw material prices. There is also the feeling that Williams may have
finally laid to rest cash flow doubts. Forecasts are for Pounds 200m in
profits this year, with the shares on a prospective p/e of about 18.
Although Williams offers solid long-term potential, the shares appear to be
fairly priced right now.

FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Independent Newspapers advances
to IPounds 15.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MCMANUS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Independent Newspapers, the Irish newspaper group controlled by Mr Tony
O'Reilly, reported a rise in pre-tax profits from IPounds 14.6m to IPounds
15.2m (Pounds 14.1m) for the half year to June 30.
The increase reflected better margins in Irish publishing operations,
improved trading conditions overseas and first-time contributions from
acquisitions in the UK and South Africa.
Independent's Irish operations accounted for IPounds 64.5m (IPounds 63.3m)
of turnover of IPounds 96.6m (IPounds 81.5m), and contributed IPounds 10.6m
(IPounds 9.4m) to operating profits of IPounds 15.8m (IPounds 11.7m).
Margins were enhanced by rationalisation and increased advertising revenue,
according to Mr Liam Healy, chief executive.
Independent has a 29.9 per cent stake in Newspaper Publishing, owner of the
UK titles, The Independent and The Independent on Sunday. Bought for IPounds
23.3m last February, the stake is treated as an investment and was the main
cause of a rise in net interest costs from IPounds 751,000 to IPounds
978,000.
Earnings per share were 9.28p (11.93p) and the interim dividend goes up from
an adjusted 2.67p to 3p.
COMMENT
The strong performance of Independent's core Irish publishing operation
makes it a good play on the recovery prospects of the Irish economy. With
improving advertising revenues feeding through, full-year profit forecasts
of about IPounds 32m seem a little on the low side. Recent circulation
figures show that Independent's titles dominate the Irish daily, evening and
Sunday markets. In the second half the group will make almost half its
operating profits outside Ireland, marking its transition into an
international media group. The prospective p/e is nearly 16 based on
yesterday's closing price of 305p. With the growth prospects, especially in
South Africa, the shares still look reasonable value.

FT  02 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Hartstone directors lift collective stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four Hartstone directors have increased their collective stake in the
hosiery and leathergoods group by more than seven times following the Pounds
30m rescue rights issue.
The company announced yesterday that the four directors, including Mr Shaun
Dowling, chairman, had increased their holding from 71,133 to 595,000
shares.
The directors both took up their entitlements through the 2-for-1 rights at
15p and bought shares in the market at 15p and 14 1/2 p.
The largest shareholder on the board is Mr Dowling, who now holds 500,000
shares, compared with 50,000 before the cash call. He took up 100,000 new
shares in the rights, and purchased a further 350,000 at 15p in his role as
sub-underwriter.
The other directors who increased their stakes are Mr John Hunter, chief
executive, with 40,000 shares (10,000), Mr Stephen Oakley, finance director,
with 30,000 (6,000) and Mr John Padovan with 25,000 (5,133).
At Hartstone's annual meeting yesterday, Mr Dowling warned that the US
leathergoods business was suffering from lower demand and the planned
cutbacks under the restructuring.
Sales were at lower levels than last year, he said. Hartstone was confident
trading would pick up in the second half, however.
The Spanish hosiery business, which may be sold at some stage in the future,
was performing satisfactorily, he added.

<TEXT>
T&amp;N, the engineering and motor components group, yesterday confirmed it was
considering a bid for Kolbenschmidt, the German vehicle parts manufacturer.
Mr Colin Hope, chairman and chief executive, said T&amp;N had held talks with

Announcing a sharp increase in first-half profits, Mr Hope warned that a
deal could be hampered by possible cartel problems in Germany, where the
enlarged group would control up to 40 per cent of the piston products
market.
Buoyant demand helped lift pre-tax profits from Pounds 39.4m to Pounds 61m,
on turnover ahead 27 per cent at Pounds 985m (Pounds 774m) in the six months
to June 30.
Although operating profits rose to Pounds 76.3m (Pounds 54.2m), the
improvement was dented by increased asbestos-related costs of Pounds 13.9m
(Pounds 9.8m) as the group topped up its liability provisions against future
legal costs and compensation claims.
Asbestos pay-outs and the second instalment on its Pounds 100m acquisition
of Goetze, the German piston ring producer, contributed to negative
operating cash flow of Pounds 6.9m, compared with a Pounds 33.3m surplus.
In a bid to strengthen its balance sheet and reduce borrowings, the group
announced an enhanced scrip alternative to its interim dividend of 7.5p
(10.85p). If all shareholders opted for the scrip - involving new ordinary
shares to a value of 11.25p for each share held - T&amp;N would retain cash of
Pounds 46m: a saving of Pounds 37m on the dividend pay-out and Pounds 9m of
advance corporation tax. It also promised a final cash dividend of not less
than 3.35p if the scrip is taken up.
Mr Hope said savings from the scrip would help reduce the group's ACT
problem, caused by having to use unrelieved UK profits to cover asbestos
liabilities in the US.
Earnings per share, meanwhile, rose from 7.7p to 4.8p.
COMMENT
T&amp;N has successfully exploited the upturn in vehicle demand and achieved
double-digit profit margins two years earlier than most analysts expected.
But it has an Achilles' heel - cashflow. The burden of asbestos compensation
and rising capital expenditure threatens to overshadow the group's
performance in outstripping profits forecasts by 20 per cent. The enhanced
scrip - designed to save cash - looks attractive at first glance but risks
diluting future earnings per share, as does the prospect of funding further
acquisitions through paper. Although full-year pre-tax profits are expected
to reach Pounds 115m, the shares look somewhat full on a forward multiple of
17.1, despite the strong growth potential.

FT  02 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Airsprung Pounds 9m expansion
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of Airsprung Furniture jumped 18p to 255p after the Wiltshire-based
group accompanied a sizeable acquisition with a cautiously optimistic
statement on current trading.
Airsprung is paying up to Pounds 9m cash for Intasco and Mensaco, both
suppliers of components and finished products to furniture markets. Initial
consideration is Pounds 7.16m with the balance on a performance-related
basis. The eventual total will be met from existing resources and
facilities.
In the year to June 30, Intasco reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 567,000
on sales of Pounds 3.66m; Mensaco made Pounds 703,000 pre-tax on turnover of
Pounds 4.92m. Trading between the two companies, which were under common
ownership, amounted to Pounds 1.31m.
Airsprung's trading since its March year-end had remained difficult, Mr John
Pierce, chief executive, said, but the first quarter had shown a
'satisfactory' increase in sales and profits.

FT  02 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Compensation provision 'clear in 10 years'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp increase in asbestos-linked personal injury claims has forced T&amp;N to
make record compensation payments in the first half of this year, writes Tim
Burt.
The company, which as Turner &amp; Newall was formerly Britain's largest
supplier of asbestos, paid claimants a total of Pounds 22.1m in the six
months to June 30, compared with just Pounds 3m last time.
Mr Colin Hope, chairman and chief executive, said the sevenfold increase
reflected the group's determination to settle as many outstanding cases as
possible before a new compensation framework came into force in North
America. Under the framework, claimants should avoid lengthy legal action by
receiving fixed compensation payments for various forms of asbestos-linked
illness.
The first-half compensation payments were paid from balance sheet
provisions, which fell from Pounds 38.4m at the year end to Pounds 34.9m at
the half-way stage.
Mr Hope predicted those provisions would decline gradually and could be
wiped out altogether within 10 years. 'The beneficial effect on gearing will
be significant and it will help our future results enormously,' he said.

FT  02 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Body Shop expose fails to shock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The long-awaited article that has helped trigger controversy over the image
of Body Shop International, the cosmetics and toiletries group, was
published yesterday to the bemusement of investors and ethical researchers.
'Shattered Image', an article in US-based Business Ethics magazine written
by Mr Jon Entine, highlighted a series of alleged inconsistencies between
Body Shop's marketing of its espoused ideals and its practices.
Some commentators expressed doubts about the potency of its revelations,
while Body Shop flatly rejected its contents.
Mr Entine said there had been a 'wide gap' between promises and delivery to
Body Shop's franchisees. He accused the company of having used off-the-shelf
product formulae filled with non-renewable petrochemicals.
He suggested there had been quality control problems, that only a tiny
amount of its ingredients came through its 'trade not aid' programme and
that its charitable contributions fell short of company statements.
He reported claims that Body Shop invented stories about the exotic origins
of some of its products. He said it had a history of legal threats against
journalists seeking to publish details behind the 'gloss'.
Body Shop yesterday called the article 'recycled rubbish' and hinted at
possible legal action by saying it was reviewing its position and would
defend its reputation. 'It is a mish-mash of defamatory and actionable
falsehoods. It contains distortions, shoddy reporting and views of several
unqualified or biased sources or so-called experts.'
Business Ethics decided not to publish or circulate its edition in the UK
following threatened legal action by Body Shop, but a number of analysts
have obtained details.
Mr Peter Webster, executive secretary of the Ethical Investment Research
Service, said: 'It doesn't seem to add up to its claims. It doesn't sound
like the end of an institution.'
He said it did not contain many of the positive aspects of the company's
activities, but said his organisation was planning to complete a full report
by next week on Body Shop.
Mr Rod Whitehead, analyst at Goldman Sachs, said: 'I felt that if (the
article) came up with some fairly serious allegations, and these were given
a fair amount of publicity in the popular press, that could affect sales
quite badly. But my impression is that they have not come up with
sufficiently new and serious allegations.'

FT  02 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Trimmer Rolls-Royce at Pounds 40m - Cost
cutting and restructuring behind 29% advance despite sales fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rolls-Royce, the aero engine and industrial power group, yesterday reported
a 29 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the first half of 1994 despite a
14 per cent decline in sales.
The higher profits of Pounds 40m (Pounds 31m) reflected the company's cost
cutting and restructuring drive, which offset continuing difficulty in the
aerospace and industrial power markets. Sales fell from Pounds 1.75bn to
Pounds 1.5bn.
Sir Ralph Robins, chairman, said he did not expect any improvement in market
conditions until 1996.
The company's restructuring programme, however, involving the closure of six
plants and the shedding of 6,500 jobs by next spring was running ahead of
plan, placing the group 'in a good competitive position to take advantage of
the orders which are expected over the longer term'.
'Conditions remain extremely challenging in all our markets, but our greater
productivity coupled with the completion of the major part of our Trent
civil engine development programme will enable us steadily to improve
performance,' Sir Ralph said. Trent engines will power the new Boeing and
Airbus wide body airliners.
Sales in the group's aerospace activities fell from Pounds 1.08bn to Pounds
924m with profits before interest of Pounds 3m (Pounds 5m). However, the
company expected civil engine deliveries for the year to be similar to the
1993 level. As expected, military engine deliveries were lower.
Sales in the industrial power operations fell to Pounds 576m (Pounds 674m),
while profits before interest rose to Pounds 37m (Pounds 35m).
The company's cost cutting drive has led to an improvement in operating
margins to 9.9 per cent (8.9 per cent).
The current order book totalled Pounds 5.9bn, excluding a further Pounds 1bn
of announced orders not yet subject to formal contracts, the company said.
The balance sheet remains strong with net cash of Pounds 309m at the end of
June. Excluding last year's rights issue, net cash has improved by Pounds
134m over the last 12 months.
The interim dividend is held at 2p, payable from earnings per share ahead to
2.53p (2.21p restated).
COMMENT
Although Rolls-Royce shares closed 8p down yesterday at 180p, the interim
figures were in line with most City estimates. The company is still having
to ride the bottom of the aerospace cycle which is unlikely to turn before
1996. However, extensive restructuring and productivity improvements should
put it in a strong position to take advantage when the upturn eventually
occurs - after a recession in the industry which started in 1990. The
company has also continued to invest in expanding its aero-engine product
range, which has placed it in a much stronger competitive position against
its US rivals than in earlier industry cycles. But there are unlikely to be
any short-term miracles and the company is likely to face another 12 to 18
months of hard slog before it finally sees some tangible improvement in its
main markets. A full-year forecast of Pounds 100m pre-tax, against Pounds
76m last year, leaves the shares on a forward multiple of nearly 29 even
after an 18p fall in two days.

FT  02 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Vickers ahead but shares fall on recovery
warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Vickers fell 7p to 188p yesterday after the engineering group,
which makes tanks and Rolls-Royce cars, said it was seeing only a patchy
recovery.
Pre-tax profits nearly doubled, from Pounds 8.3m to Pounds 15.9m, but were
still slightly below market expectations. Sales were flat at Pounds 330m
(Pounds 331m).
Sir Richard Lloyd, chairman, said the recovery in results which started last
year had continued, but this was more to do with plant rationalisation and
efficiency measures than improvements in markets.
Sales of Rolls-Royce cars rose slightly, from 683 to to 701, and higher
sales in the UK and east Asia (excluding Japan) offset poor sales in North
America.
Sir Colin Chandler, chief executive, said he hoped by the end of the year to
reveal the outcome of talks the group has been having with other
manufacturers over collaboration on new model programmes.
Vickers will not say who it has been talking to, but is known to have been
discussing the purchase of V12 engines and other components from
Mercedes-Benz of Germany.
Cosworth, the high-performance engine subsidiary, is still suffering from
declining demand for special Ford Escorts and Scorpios, but is investing in
a new factory for its castings business and an emission centre.
The group's defence systems business now has a total order book of Pounds
1.5bn, following the government's recent confirmation of the follow-on order
for 259 Challenger 2 tanks, in addition to the 127 tanks ordered in 1991.
Sir Colin said the strength of this order book made the defence business a
much stronger and more attractive partner when considering collaborative
projects.
The medical division's contribution fell, partly because of continued
uncertainty over the proposed Clinton healthcare reforms and tough trading
conditions for distributors in continental Europe.
The propulsion technology division continued to suffer from the depressed
state of the aerospace business, but on the marine side the Swedish-based
KaMeWa company had an 'outstanding' six months.
Earnings per share improved to 3.6p (1.9p).
The interim dividend rose to 1.75p (1.25p).
COMMENT
The trading statement was deliberately downbeat, to lower expectations about
the speed of likely recovery. But Vickers still looks in a strong position,
following last year's Pounds 60m rights issue and the recent award of the
crucial Challenger order. Capital investment is being increased -
particularly at Cosworth - and there is some scope for margin improvement at
the tank factories. On a prospective multiple of 19, the shares cannot be
called cheap, but a modest upturn in demand for cars will sharply improve
the bottom line. The shares are unlikely to move decisively until the group
reveals its decision over collaboration on the next generation of luxury
cars.

FT  02 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Motor side helps Barr &amp; WAT advance 40%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Barr &amp; Wallace Arnold Trust, the motor distribution and
leisure and holiday group, advanced 40 per cent from Pounds 663,000 to
Pounds 928,000 in the half-year to June.
The rise was achieved in spite of greater losses in leisure and holidays and
on the back of a 39 per cent increase at the operating level in the motor
distribution side. Here profits emerged at Pounds 1.98m (Pounds 1.42m) on
divisional turnover up at Pounds 82.2m (Pounds 68.2m).
Mr John Parker, chief executive since May when Mr Malcolm Barr, chairman,
ceded half the dual role, said new car sales, were ahead of the market.
The group took steps to develop its used cars sales operations, which,
including the concomitant financing and MOT sides, outperformed the new car
side.
As part of plans for 'controlled expansion', the group bought in August a
Mercedes dealership in Bristol for Pounds 3.66m, bringing the total to eight
dealerships.
Mr Parker said he was brought in to 'look at changing the culture of the
company', though he stressed that Mr Barr was the only family member on the
board and that the family was being proactive in the process. The group has
2.45m ordinary shares and almost 10m A non-voting.
The leisure and holidays side incurred losses of Pounds 820,000 (Pounds
538,000) on turnover of Pounds 31m (Pounds 30.2m).
Group turnover rose 15 per cent to Pounds 124m (Pounds 108m). Earnings were
4.8p (3.5p) and the interim dividend is held at 3p.

FT  02 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Michael Page ahead sharply to Pounds 4.35m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Michael Page Group rose 24 1/2 p to 114p as the international
recruitment and executive selection consultant announced pre-tax profits
more than doubled from Pounds 1.57m to Pounds 4.35m for the first half of
1994.
Mr Terry Benson, chief executive, said 'favourable trading conditions had
helped all the UK businesses exceed expectations'. This was in contrast to
the 'mixed progress' on the Continent.
Group turnover expanded from Pounds 23.4m to Pounds 34.2m. The previous
year's figure, however, included Pounds 1.16m from LBW France, which has
since been sold. Operating profits were Pounds 4.19m, against Pounds 1.49 -
including losses of Pounds 109,000 from LBW France.
Within the UK, turnover was divided as to 70 per cent permanent recruitment
and 30 per cent temporary. Revenue in the permanent side rose more than 51
per cent and the temporary side 'higher than that'.
Michael Page Marketing and Sales expanded further and, as a result, Sales
Recruitment Specialists was set up to provide sales representatives at the
lower end of the pay spectrum. Mr Benson said the accountancy side expected
to open two more offices by December, bringing the total to 10.
In mainland Europe, profits at the French operations enjoyed a substantial
increase, 'being well past the worst' as the economy recovers. Mr Benson was
more cautious about Germany and the Netherlands, where trading conditions
continued to be difficult. The outlook, however, seemed brighter, and
another German office is to be opened in Frankfurt.
The group is also planning to open an office in Hong Kong. In spite of the
start-up costs, Mr Benson is expecting long-term rewards from the Asian
market.
The interim dividend is raised to 0.8p (0.6p), payable from earnings sharply
up at 4.45p (1.65p) per share.

FT  02 SEP 94 / UK Company News: US giant takes small house
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
American giant gobbles up English miniature and, contrary to mythic
expectation, everyone says they are all going to live happily together ever
after.
This was the tale being told yesterday as Stanhome, a US marketer and
distributor of consumer products, giftware and collectibles, added another
collectible line to its collection.
It made a recommended cash offer of 160p a share for Lilliput, the
Cumbria-based maker of hand-painted miniature china cottages, casting a ray
of sunshine on to a niche in the small housing market.
The bid values Lilliput, which floated less than a year ago in October, at
Pounds 37.2m. At the flotation price of 135p it was valued at Pounds 31.4m.
Yesterday morning the shares opened at 92p.
As a result Mr John Russell, Lilliput chairman and chief executive, said
that he would have done the deal no differently in an ideal world.
He felt he had fulfilled his obligations to shareholders and, because
Lilliput will stand alone within Stanhome, to the future of the company and
its staff.
Mr Russell, who had 600,000 shares, is set to make Pounds 1m gross, while Mr
DG Tate, the group's founder who had some 3.8m shares, will gain about
Pounds 6m. Both men made substantial amounts at the time of the float.
At the time of the morning's announcement, Stanhome had received acceptances
in respect of 10.3m shares, or 44.4 per cent, from directors, their wives,
North of England Ventures and Lazard Ventures.
By 4.30pm Stanhome spoke for 57.9 per cent, having bought a further 13.5 per
cent at 158p.
Stanhome has three divisions: Lilliput will fall within Enesco Worldwide
Giftware, which in 1993 contributed 49 per cent of the Dollars 751m (Pounds
485m) group sales. Enesco designs and markets giftware, licensed lines and
collectibles and sells them through some 50,000 retail outlets mostly in the
US.
Mr Bill Seawright, Stanhome chief executive, said most of its collectibles,
in particular its Precious Moments line, were made in China. Lilliput's
products are made in the UK, an important factor for the east Asian market.
There would be synergies in US distribution - cottages are 'hot' in the US,
according to Mr Seawright - and Stanhome wanted a 'neat, tidy' company as a
foothold in Europe, a market it wanted to expand into.
He said that collectibles was a growing market, especially in the US and
particularly for women.

FT  02 SEP 94 / UK Company News: United Carriers falls to Pounds 1.2m at
midway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Poor trading conditions pushed down interim pre-tax profits at United
Carriers, the parcel and freight company which was floated in February.
In the half year to July 2 pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds
1.2m on turnover up from Pounds 52.7m to Pounds 59m.
Operating profits, which included a Pounds 364,000 loss on discontinued
operations last time, were down from Pounds 1.98m to Pounds 1.63m.
Earnings per share fell from 5.8p to 3p, adjusted to reflect the scrip issue
in February.
Mr Allan Binks, chairman, said that as foreshadowed in the profits warning
in May, the company's UK parcels and freight network suffered a sharp drop
in volumes.
The division had secured new customers, he said, but any benefits from the
additional business would not be felt until next year.
Although volumes had improved in May, Mr Binks said there was 'no reason to
change earlier expectations that volumes would remain flat during the second
half of the year'.
Operating profits in the specialist transport and distribution division were
also lower, although there were signs of a steady improvement in the UK and
Continental car markets.
Margins in this division would be improved in the second half by the
acquisition of 100 large trailers which would reduce spot hiring, Mr Binks
said.
The company has net assets assets of Pounds 29.1m (Pounds 24.7m) and gearing
of 17 per cent.
United Carriers shares closed unchanged at 103p yesterday.
On the day of the profits warning in May, the shares fell by 33p to 115p.
The flotation price was 153p, which produced a market capitalisation of
Pounds 51.8m.

FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Restructuring behind rise to
IPounds 5m at Waterford Wedgwood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MCMANUS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Waterford Wedgwood, the crystal and tableware group, yesterday announced
figures described by Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman, as its 'best first-half
results since 1987'.
Mr O'Reilly said the increase in pre-tax profits, from IPounds 400,000 to
IPounds 5.1m (Pounds 5.04m), 'fully justifies the actions, initiatives and
strategies implemented in the past two years'.
Sales rose IPounds 13.9m to IPounds 149m, while profits before interest more
than doubled to IPounds 7.9m (IPounds 3.6m). Lower interest charges of
IPounds 2.8m (IPounds 3.2m) and a higher tax charge of IPounds 800,000
(IPounds 300,000) left retained profits of IPounds 4.3m. The group has taken
a charge of IPounds 1.8m for restructuring in both the crystal and china
divisions.
Wedgwood sales were up 8 per cent to IPounds 104m, while operating profits
more than doubled to IPounds 4.5m - the first increase in profits at
Wedgwood in three years. Wedgwood's earthenware pottery subsidiary, Johnson
Brothers, continued to perform badly,with sales reduced by stiff
competition.
The improved operating profits at Wedgwood reflected last year's
restructuring and improved sales in the US and UK. Sales in Japan remained
steady following price reductions, the company said.
Sales of crystal rose 16 per cent to IPounds 44.9m and operating profits
more than doubled to IPounds 3.4m due to strong sales in the US and Ireland.
However, sales growth of Waterford's mid-market Marquis range tapered off
after two years of strong growth.
Earnings per share amounted to 0.6p (0.02p).
COMMENT
Mr O'Reilly hinted strongly at a resumed dividend payment at Waterford
Wedgwood's annual meeting earlier this year. On the basis of these interims,
a nominal but welcome dividend of about 0.5p looks on the cards. The
reduction in debt to Pounds 58m puts gearing at 48 per cent. The company is
not fully out of the woods, however, as shown by the Pounds 1.8m
restructuring charge, and analysts are expected to leave their forecasts
unchanged at this stage. Most are opting for full-year pre-tax profits of
between IPounds 22m and IPounds 23m, equivalent to earnings of just under 3p
 -a prospective p/e of 23.5, reflecting recovery prospects.

FT  02 SEP 94 / UK Company News: SE considers short selling regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Stock Exchange is to consult stock market participants on the potential
regulation of short-selling, in the wake of complaints over the impact of
speculative short sellers on recent share offers.
The Exchange said it would issue a consultative document during September to
tap views 'on proposals for dealing with concerns' over short selling.
Short sellers drive down the share price of companies which are arranging
substantial share issues by selling shares that they do not own. Speculators
can then balance their 'short' positions by buying cheaper shares through
the secondary market issue.
SG Warburg, brokers to the Treasury for last year's BT3 share issue, tried
to persuade the Stock Exchange to implement rules to prevent substantial
investors from driving down the British Telecom share price prior to the
offer. The request was turned down under pressure from a number of large
institutions.
However, Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board,
gave a speech last July urging the Exchange to introduce rules governing
short selling prior to secondary market issues.
The Exchange cited 'concerns expressed at the time of the British Telecom
and Wellcome share issues', both more than 14 months ago, as the driving
force behind its latest decision.
A response to the consultation process is likely by the end of this year.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Reckitt slides on cautious outlook: Growth 'will take a
while to filter through' warns toiletries group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Reckitt &amp; Colman fell 25p to 627p yesterday after the household
products and toiletries group delivered slightly weaker than expected
interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 123.3m and a cautious trading statement.
'The tough competitive and economic conditions which affected the group's
performance in the first-half year persist and are unlikely to improve in
the second half,' it said.
New products in core brands such as Harpic lavatory cleaner helped
compensate for the flat demand Reckitt said it faced in Europe and North
America.
Economic growth 'will take a while to filter through to our consumer
products', said Mr Vernon Sankey, chief executive. Confident of its brand
strengths and outlook, Reckitt raised its interim dividend by 7.8 per cent
to 6.95p a share. Fully diluted earnings were 21.8p per share against
24.62p. Adjusted for exceptional items they were 24.9p against 23.7p
The pre-tax profits of Pounds 123.3m for the six months to July 2, down from
Pounds 143.6m a year earlier, included a Pounds 56m charge for rationalising
Reckitt's European operations and a Pounds 30m gain from the sale of its
European pigments business in March.
Mr Sankey said the European reorganisation, its second in five years, would
generate annual cost savings of some Pounds 25m.
Operating profits from continuing operations before the exceptional charge
were flat at Pounds 169.9m but the profit margin rose to 16.4 per cent from
15.8 per cent, reflecting a dip in sales to Pounds 1.04bn from Pounds
1.07bn. Adjusted for sales of some minor brands and currency changes, sales
were flat.
Household and toiletry products showed a marginal increase in operating
profits to Pounds 121.4m due mostly to new products in North America and
Europe. Sales were down Pounds 29m at Pounds 724.1m.
Pharmaceutical profits were down slightly at Pounds 22.2m on sales ahead 5
per cent at Pounds 107m. Mr Sankey said Reckitt was benefiting from rapid
growth of non-prescription drugs. But, he added, 'we have no ambitions' to
expand in the US over-the-counter market. 'It is too late and too
difficult.'
He declined to comment on speculation that Reckitt might bid for Eastman
Kodak's household goods division.
The company would continue to buy brands in household products, toiletries
and pharmaceuticals and perhaps in food, he added.
Reckitt's food sector reported operating profits of Pounds 23.2m, down from
Pounds 34.4m including an exceptional gain of Pounds 10m a year earlier.
The main weakness for Reckitt was in the UK soft drinks market. Volumes in
its segment fell some 3 per cent. Net borrowings at the half-year fell to
Pounds 170m from Pounds 310.7m a year earlier.

It was clear that Mr Tiny Rowland had won another remarkable victory over
his fellow Lonrho directors when half way through yesterday's boardroom
meeting an ambiguous statement was issued to the Stock Exchange. The
statement, dismissing so-called speculation about Mr Rowland's future but
raising questions over his remuneration package, was put out on the
instructions of Mr Robert Dunlop, deputy chairman, and one of Mr Rowland's
closet allies.
Mr Rowland said nothing at the meeting. He knew he did not have to. He had
already heard an hour and half before it started that the three
non-executives had decided that a row over his possible premature departure
had to be avoided at all costs.
Mr Peter Harper, a director of Hanson, Sir John Leahy, a former ambassador
to South Africa and Mr Stephen Walls, chairman of Albert Fisher Group, had
all been appointed to the Lonrho board by Mr Dieter Bock, the German
financier with 18.8 per cent of the shares.
Mr Bock had been convinced that the three would support his moves to remove
Mr Rowland as joint chief executive. But one of the non-executives said
yesterday: 'An orderly and civilised option was preferable to a row which
could have damaged the company.'
Mr Bock is said to believe that he still achieved an important victory over
Mr Rowland, albeit of less significance that he originally planned. The
board statement made it clear that the company 'continually has under review
the ongoing expense levels at head office'. This was interpreted by those
close to Mr Bock as giving the company's remuneration committee the
authority to investigate Mr Rowland's expenses.
Further details also emerged of the Pounds 5.5m a year which Mr Rowland
costs the company in salary, expenses and other charges under his direct
control.
In the nine months to June 30 1994, just under Pounds 200,000 had been spent
from a 'hotels' expenses account on politicians and business contacts. In
the same period, there were also so-called 'special payments' in the UK of
about Pounds 190,000, Kenyan expenses of Pounds 250,000 and Zimbabwe charges
of Pounds 80,000. South African expenses were more than Pounds 80,000 for
eight months to May 31.
The company was also charged more than Pounds 110,000 for Mr Rowland's
domestic staff in 1993.
In addition, there are annual charges of about Pounds 200,000 for the
education of the dependants of African politicians and business contacts and
a contribution of more than Pounds 450,000 to the costs of Mr Rowland's
homes in Belgravia and Buckinghamshire. His basic salary exceeds Pounds
1.2m.
A Lonrho employee said: 'The company has traditionally been run a bit like a
government, in the sense that sums of money were voted for various general
purposes to particular directors, who then had considerable discretion over
how they were disbursed.'
But irrespective of whether the disclosure of Mr Rowland's costs have made
his position untenable in the medium term, he has bought time in his battle
with Mr Bock. In 1973, Mr Basil Small-peice led a majority on the board
which pressed for Mr Rowland's resignation. They were persuaded by Mr
Rowland to allow him time to sell his shares - which accounted for about 20
per cent of the company. But instead of resigning Mr Rowland turned the
tables on the so-called 'straight eight' whom he ensured were dismissed at a
subsequent extraordinary general meeting.
More than two decades later, Mr Rowland has only 6.5 per cent of the shares.
Mr Bock may still have the upper hand but he has suffered his first defeat
in his attempt to wrest control from Mr Rowland.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Elf blames 10% fall on lower oil prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Elf Aquitaine, the French oil group, yesterday blamed a 10 per cent drop in
first-half net profits, to FFr1.2bn (Pounds 145m) on lower crude oil prices
and refining margins and higher financial charges.
Mr Philippe Jaffre, chairman, said uncertainties over the price of oil and
the value of the dollar made full-year forecasts difficult. In 1993 Elf
showed a FFr1.4bn net profit in the first six months but turned in FFr1.07bn
for the full year.
'We are still on course in our strategy to concentrate on our core sectors
of oil, chemicals and health, and to improve our competitiveness to the
level of other oil majors,' he said. After rapid expansion in recent years,
Mr Jaffre said the group's goal now was to consolidate its position by
cost-cutting and sales of non-core businesses.
Capital spending was 13 per cent lower in the first half, while the French
group has cut its stake in the Leuna refinery project in eastern Germany
from 100 to 43 per cent. Mr Jaffre said asset sales of FFr1.5bn in the first
half were 'a bit slower than I had hoped', but he predicted sales of
FFr5bn-6bn this year and about the same next year.
Elf said profits on chemicals tripled in the first half and its health
activities remained stable.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Ladbroke to pay Pounds 50m for three casinos: Hotels and
Texas DIY pull interim profits down by 11 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ladbroke Group yesterday placed a Pounds 50m bet on the future of London
casinos, returning to the tables after a 15-year absence. The purchase of
Maxim's, Golden Horseshoe and Charlie Chester's marks the first step in
Ladbroke's strategy to play for bigger stakes in the growing global gaming
business.
Mr Trevor Hemmings, owner of the three casinos, will become one of
Ladbroke's largest single shareholders. A leisure tycoon who made his
fortune by selling Pontin's holiday camps to Scottish &amp; Newcastle, Mr
Hemmings will hold almost 2 per cent of Ladbroke after the deal.
The deal is subject to approval from the Gaming Board, a process which could
take up to a year. Ladbrokes has retained the casinos' management, however,
in a move which is expected to enhance its chances of approval.
Ladbroke was forced to give up four West End casinos in 1979, after
allegations of malpractice over its unorthodox attempts to win business from
rivals, including sending attractive women to the hotel rooms of high
rollers. Before yesterday's deal, it owned 13 casinos around the world.
The gaming, hotels, retail and property group also announced an 11 per cent
fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 57.8m to Pounds 51.3m, before an
exceptional gain of Pounds 6m, for the six months to June 30. Turnover was
Pounds 2.29bn (Pounds 2.21bn).
Ladbroke also said it would carry out a root-and-branch review of its
businesses expected to result in a 'cohesive strategic plan' for the group
by next year.
Analysts were disappointed by the results and strategic review. The shares
fell by 1p to 167p.
The biggest disappointment came from Ladbroke's hotels division, which was
hit by poor trading in Japan. Mr George said the four Japanese hotels -
which had returned profits of Pounds 20m at their peak in 1991, would make
little or no profit this year. This offset an improved performance from UK
hotels. Divisional profits were 6 per cent down at Pounds 44.6m.
Ladbroke was also hit by a sharp downturn from the Texas DIY chain, where
profits fell from Pounds 16.6m to Pounds 2m.
The core betting business returned better than expected results. Mr Peter
George, group chief executive, said the interest generated by the World Cup
had proved there were still substantial opportunities to expand the betting
market. A widely feared downturn in credit betting had not materialised and
the division returned profits 15 per cent ahead to Pounds 49.2m.
Property sales were also better than expected, with a net profit of Pounds
1.7m achieved on disposals totalling Pounds 140m. The disposals left rental
income 28 per cent lower at Pounds 16.6m.
Earnings per share before exceptionals were 18 per cent lower at 2.96p
(3.60p). The interim dividend was cut to 2.4p (4.92p) in line with the
reduction in last year's final. Mr Hemmings will receive 21.2m new Ladbroke
shares and Pounds 14.25m in cash for the businesses and freeholds of the
three casinos.

FT  02 SEP 94 / ABN Amro to use Hoare Govett name worldwide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hoare Govett, the London stockbroking firm acquired by the Dutch bank ABN
Amro two years ago, is to be renamed ABN Amro Hoare Govett as part of the
bank's effort to create a global investment banking arm.
ABN Amro, the seventh largest European bank, is to use the name for all its
equity broking, fixed income and corporate finance operations around the
world provided that it can overcome regulatory hurdles in some countries.
The bank has been building a network of brokers in Europe, including the
Irish firm Riada Stockbrokers, CIMO in Milan, and Massonaud-Fontenay-Kervern
in Paris. Along with the bank's own broking operations, these may be
re-named next year.
The use of both names is similar to the strategy used by Union Bank of
Switzerland when it acquired the broker Phillips &amp; Drew in 1989. The London
investment banking arm was known as UBS Phillips &amp; Drew until it was
re-named UBS this year.
However, ABN Amro's board has decided to extend the Hoare Govett name to
fixed income and corporate finance operations because it regards it as a
stronger international brand name than its own, which was created in a
merger in 1991.
ABN Amro is keen to ensure that Hoare Govett's relations with London
merchant banks are not affected by the use of the name for corporate finance
activities. The London corporate broking arm will still be known as Hoare
Govett.
Mr Rijnhard van Tets, ABN Amro's board member for global investment banking,
said the change of name was intended to underline ABN Amro's commitment to
the creation of a global network for underwriting and selling securities.
Some 40 per cent of the assets of ABN Amro, which dominates corporate
banking in the Netherlands. are outside its home country. It has a strong
presence in the US through the La Salle group in Illinois, and European
American Bank on Long Island.
ABN Amro started running its equity operations from Hoare Govett in London
this year, and is now trying to build up its European corporate finance
business.
The use of the combined name ABN Amro Hoare Govett could be used for
marketing purposes later this year.
Few of the biggest London broking firms before the Big Bang deregulation of
the City in 1986 have retained their independence or their names.
Rowe &amp; Pitman, the broking firm taken over by SG Warburg in 1986 was
re-named SG Warburg Securities two years ago. The name of Grieveson Grant,
the broker which merged with the merchant bank Kleinwort Benson, has also
been dropped.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Brussels may delay moves on EU media ownership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission is considering delaying proposals to harmonise rules
on media ownership in the EU, amid concern about a backlash among member
states worried about intrusive Brussels regulation.
A decision to delay would be a setback for Mr Vanni d'Archirafi, the Italian
internal market commissioner, who would like to introduce a new EU directive
at the end of this year or early 1995. But majority sentiment in the
Commission seems in favour of a 'softly softly' approach.
Under a compromise that emerged in late July at a meeting of chiefs of staff
of the 17 commissioners, the Commission will be asked this month to consider
supporting an 'initiative' on media ownership, pending fuller consultation
with member states.
'We think we need to do something, but we don't want to prejudge the
question of legislation,' said one official. 'This is a very important, very
touchy subject.'
Mr d'Archirafi argues that investment in Europe's single market is being
held back by the patchwork of media ownership rules. He believes that an
'initiative' - however it is dressed up - must lead to an EU directive if it
is to be effective.
The Italian commissioner has also argued, with some success, that the EU
must position itself quickly to exploit advances in broadcasting technology
which are paving the way for pay television, video on demand, and the
proliferation of specialised TV channels. Germany's Martin Bangemann, the
industry commissioner, supports this view.
But Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, has raised questions about
the need for EU-wide legislation, fearing it could infringe the principle of
subsidiarity - devolving decision-making to the lowest appropriate national
or regional level.
The problems created by differences in media ownership surfaced during a
consultation exercise the Commission last year.
For example, in the Netherlands, newspaper publishers with a market share of
more than 25 per cent cannot own a television channel, but in Italy the
threshold is 16 per cent. In the UK, newspapers can not own more than 20 per
cent of terrestrial channels, but there is no limit on ownership of
satellite channels.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Welsh regeneration to be funded by private sector, says
Redwood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, told business leaders yesterday that
in future most of the money for Welsh economic regeneration would come from
the private sector.
Increasing grants from the public sector paid directly to companies was not
the best way to create new jobs, he said.
'The idea that Wales's economy is a vulgarised Keynes-by-the-sea, propped up
grants on the pier and subsidies on the amusement arcades, is a myth which
does not bear scrutiny.'
In a keynote speech on economic development in Wales at the opening of the
D'Arcy Business Park near Neath in south Wales, Mr Redwood said the
principality was 'spinning out of recession in an impressive way'.
It was leading in the attraction of new jobs and inward investment as well
as the creation of more enterprises at home. Unemployment had fallen from
10.5 per cent to 9.6 per cent between December 1992 and July 1994, to the
point where it was now in line with the UK average.
But this had not been achieved on the back of government subsidies.
Mr Redwood said grants had their place for three of the four factors which
he regarded as the motors that power the Welsh economy - well-trained
people, a decent supply of land and a good transport system. The fourth -
access to money to do the job - he saw coming increasingly from the private
sector.
He conceded that some direct subsidies to companies had their uses.
'Grants are useful in encouraging footloose business to locate in more
disadvantaged areas. It is for that reason that we offer them in parts of
Wales. I have no plans to make further changes in the grant system. I am not
about to threaten the most disadvantaged areas of Wales with the removal of
their grants,' Mr Redwood said.
But he added: 'Most of the money for Welsh regeneration will come from the
private sector and will be channelled through a multitude of companies
drawing on support from the financial markets and banks.'

FT  02 SEP 94 / US and N Korea agree to meet in Pyongyang: Nuclear talks
will parallel diplomatic discussions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US and North Korean officials will meet in Pyongyang next week to discuss
the opening of liaison offices in the two countries. Such a move would be a
significant step towards establishing diplomatic relations.
Simultaneously, the two sides will meet in Berlin to discuss a US offer of
light-water reactors, the supply of interim energy sources to North Korea
while these reactors are being constructed, and the disposal of North
Korea's spent fuel rods, which are capable of producing enough plutonium for
five nuclear bombs.
The meetings, which will begin on September 10, are the result of last
month's US-North Korean framework agreement. Under the accord, Pyongyang
promised to accept full international nuclear inspections in return for
improved ties with Washington and the supply of safe reactors to replace its
dangerous graphite ones.
The talks confirm North Korea's willingness to abide by the agreement, while
they also offer evidence that the succession of power in Pyongyang by Mr Kim
Jong-il is proceeding smoothly after the death of his father, President Kim
Il-sung, in July.
Officials in Seoul said it was unlikely that the US negotiators would have
been allowed to go to Pyongyang if a serious power struggle was under way in
North Korea, as has been rumoured in recent days.
The talks are a preparatory step to the resumption of high-level bilateral
negotiations, which will begin on September 23 in Geneva and are intended to
achieve a final settlement of the North Korean nuclear dispute.
South Korean officials expressed concern that North Korea had already won a
diplomatic victory by persuading the US to hold discussions about the
establishment of relations in the North Korean capital.
The opening of liaison offices was used by the US to establish links with
China in the early 1970s after decades of hostility.
There are signs of increased friction between South Korea and the US on the
proposed settlement of the nuclear issue. Some officials in Seoul are
criticising the US for rushing towards an agreement with North Korea.
Meanwhile, Mr Kim Pyong-il, stepbrother of Mr Kim Jong-il, said that the
latter would shortly take formal power in North Korea, as the official
assumption of leadership has been delayed because of an extended mourning
period for his father.

FT  02 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Body Shop
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The much-heralded US article on the Body Shop contained no shockers. The
main categories of criticism had already been leaked. True, a lively debate
over whether the detailed charges are accurate looks set to rage for some
time. But the City has come to the conclusion that the criticism will have
precious little impact on the business. A few so-called ethical shareholders
may expect purity from the Body Shop. But most do not. If ethical investors
sell out, others will pick up their shares at a bargain.
The City will only worry if Body Shop's image is so tarnished that customers
stop buying its products. So far, it has taken the view that they will not.
Squabbles with franchisees and a few shampoo spillages are unlikely to turn
people away from Body Shop. Most customers are attracted by its bright
colours and powerful aromas.
This is not to say that Body Shop cannot learn lessons from the saga. In a
moment of pique, Mr Gordon Roddick, who with his wife Anita founded the Body
Shop, said that maybe they should 'no longer even try to be remotely
ethical'. Reflection will show that this is not the lesson. Companies, like
individuals, should behave ethically, though the exact definition of such
behaviour is open to debate. The lesson is rather one of presentation. Those
who proclaim their virtue as energetically as the Body Shop has leave
themselves wide open to criticism if they make the slightest slip.

FT  02 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Reckitt &amp; Colman
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the European rationalisation programme announced by Reckitt &amp; Colman
yesterday is its second such initiative in under five years it is debatable
how 'exceptional' the related Pounds 56m provision really is. The fact that
the company was vague on details only added to the impression that it was
part of an on-going process. True, the previous operation was carried out
before the group acquired Boyle-Midway in 1990. But that suggests it has
taken the group rather a long time to identify opportunities to rationalise
manufacturing and distribution. It is tempting to conclude that the
programme is a reaction to the group's poor performance in Europe.
The fall in European profits was disappointing when compared with Unilever's
results, and though much can be put down to recession, the signs of
switching to own-label products raise questions about the eventual impact of
economic recovery. In North America consumers are not returning to previous
spending patterns in a hurry while competition in the supermarkets remains
intense. That in turn throws doubt on Reckitt's confidence that it can
continue to increase margins which have now topped 16 per cent.
Even if it continues to grow well in Latin America and Asia the group
outlook is dull unless it can restart sales growth in the mature economies.
Against this background it would be surprising if Reckitt were not looking
at large potential acquisitions like Eastman Kodak's household products
business. But only the chance that Reckitt itself might become a target
justifies the stock's small premium rating compared to Unilever.

FT  02 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Ladbroke
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The warm glow of approval for Ladbroke's new open management style has
already dissipated. The shares have lost all the ground gained early in the
year following Mr Cyril Stein's decision to cut his links with the group he
created. It is not that Mr Peter George, the chief executive, has drifted
back into the bad old ways. Yesterday's half-year figures were a model of
clarity. The trouble is that a clear view of trading prospects is hardly
uplifting.
The performance of Hilton hotels is especially disappointing. Even allowing
for economic recovery in continental Europe, it will be a long time before
Ladbroke sees a decent return on the Pounds 1.8bn capital tied up in that
business. That is not to deny the long-term attractions of hotels, or the
logic of its marriage to gaming within the Ladbroke empire. The group's
modest move back into casinos could create additional synergies. But neither
hotels nor gaming is likely to deliver the kind of earnings growth the stock
market was anticipating earlier in the year.
This might explain Ladbroke's decision to invest in the Texas DIY chain
rather than look for a quick sale. Even modest margin improvements on
Texas's Pounds 700m annual sales would add pep to group profits. Optimism on
that score - and the prospects for early realisation of the remaining Pounds
600m property portfolio - should limit the downside for the shares. But it
is difficult to see that Ladbroke brings much to retailing in the longer
term. The sooner Ladbroke places its bets firmly on hotels and leisure the
better.

<TEXT>
One cannot fail to admire Mr Tiny Rowland's ability to prevail in boardroom
battles. Nevertheless, his defeat of the campaign to oust him as one of
Lonrho's chief executives leaves outside shareholders in an uncomfortable
position. The company now faces the possibility of a long power struggle
between two rival chief executives. Mr Dieter Bock, the other chief
executive, may hope that Mr Rowland will retire after a decent interval. But
there can be no guarantee that, having won yesterday's skirmish, he will now
vacate the battlefield.
Mr Bock stands accused of poor judgment by mounting his attack against Mr
Rowland at this time. He clearly over-estimated his chances of winning. It
would have been better to wait two months until the balance of the board had
shifted further in his favour. It is hard to see how the two men can now
work together.
The main damage to shareholders is that Lonrho's corporate strategy will
remain unresolved. There is significant potential to enhance shareholder
value by streamlining Lonrho's ragbag of businesses. Minority stakes in some
of the African operations could be floated to reveal the full value on the
group's assets. Alternatively, businesses could be completely demerged or
sold to trade buyers. Some analysts believe the group's break-up value is
180p-200p a share, compared with last night's close of 143p. Mr Bock, a
trader of assets at heart, seems keen to embark on some such programme. But
so long as Mr Rowland still wields power at Lonrho, radical restructuring
looks unlikely.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Seeking a role for Apec
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 17 members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum have been long
on visionary declarations about forging closer regional ties. They have been
much shorter, however, on specific plans. This week, a panel of expert
advisers sought to fill the vacuum with a blueprint for the long-term
development of the organisation.
Under the rubric of 'open regionalism', their report urges Apec leaders to
commit themselves at their November summit in Jakarta to the total
elimination of trade and investment barriers in the region by 2020. The aim,
they stress, should not be to create an inward-looking trade bloc, but to
use liberalisation within Apec to promote the advance of global free trade,
in conformity with the principles of the Gatt.
The authors of the report are to be commended both for their forthright
rejection of the notion of a 'Fortress Apec' and for their drafting skills.
In formulating their recommendations, they have had to bridge widely
differing viewpoints among the organisation's members. While the US and
Australia are keen that Apec should develop into an active trade negotiating
forum, that idea is opposed by a number of Asian members, including Japan
and Hong Kong. Against this background, the government-appointed experts'
unanimous agreement on the report's recommendations is no mean feat.
Richest economies
Whether their proposed way forward is either politically feasible or
economically desirable is, however, much more debatable. Impressive as the
aggregate economic weight of Apec's members may be - accounting for half the
world's trade and 60 per cent of its GNP - their diversity is more striking
than their similarities. They include the US and Japan, the world's two
richest economies, but also China and Indonesia, two of its poorest. The
main distinguishing feature of economic relations within Apec is the
dependence of most of its members on trade with the US, rather than with
each other.
This is not an obvious basis for regional trade liberalisation. It is made
no easier by the fact that disputes between Apec members are also at the
heart of almost every big confrontation in the international trade system,
ranging from trade in services to anti-dumping, labour standards and the
environment. It is unclear that Apec's members would be better able to
settle these differences in regional negotiations when they have signally
failed to do so in the Gatt. It is no less utopian to believe that the US
will suddenly drop its aggressive trade stance towards countries such as
Japan and China and agree to offer them trade concessions as part of
Apec-wide liberalisation.
Daunting hurdles
But even if these daunting hurdles could be overcome, would an Apec
liberalisation programme benefit the world economy, as the report's authors
contend? Their argument rests heavily on the claim that freer regional trade
provides powerful momentum at the global level. To the extent that disputes
between Apec members are responsible for thwarting progress in the Gatt,
they may have a point. Against that, the notion raises two objections.
One is that any meaningful regional programme would require a huge
commitment of government resources, and would therefore be likely to divert
negotiating efforts away from the Gatt and its planned successor, the World
Trade Organisation. The other objection is that any liberalisation programme
designed primarily to satisfy Apec members could become an alternative to
the Gatt. The consequences would be all the more serious if the programme
aimed, as the report recommends, to tackle not only border obstacles but
government procurement and competition policy. Other countries which sought
reciprocal trade agreements with Apec might then have no choice but to
accept rules dictated by the organisation.
At present, that remains a remote possibility. It is one that many of Apec's
members - as well as other countries - would also strongly resist. The
experts' report offers Apec leaders an extremely ambitious agenda. Their
sensible course in Jakarta may be to settle for more modest objectives.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Life with Tiny (contd)
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It would be understating things to say that Mr Roland 'Tiny' Rowland of
Lonrho is an anachronism in the sanitised entrepreneurial world of the late
20th century. Despite the mushroom growth of rules, regulations and codes of
corporate conduct he is still there, defiant, at the age of 76, even as the
remuneration committees roam and the audit committees delve. Yesterday,
despite reports of an impending boardroom coup, he emerged with his expenses
uncut, his position intact and his life expectancy almost certainly
enhanced. It is, of course, an act to which he has devoted some practice.
The directors who are hostile to Mr Rowland can console themselves with the
thought that he is (probably) mortal. But they will have to hone their
skills at corporate trench warfare if they wish to procure any other
denouement in the near term. For outside observers the question is whether
there are wider lessons to be drawn from the continuing saga surrounding
this most durable of maverick entrepreneurs.
That seems doubtful because Lonrho is sui generis, even if Mr Rowland is
not. But it remains worth asking how the man who built up this huge
international conglomerate has been able to run it down again over such a
protracted period without anyone pre-empting the process. It is not as if Mr
Rowland has had a controlling interest in the company. Yet he has had a
remarkably free run in capital markets where the penalties for poor
performance have grown harsher in recent years. If he is now under threat
from his fellow joint managing director and chief executive, Mr Dieter Bock,
it is only because he himself chose to bring him into Lonrho as a potential
successor.
Straight eight
One explanation for Mr Rowland's laissez-passer stems from the outcome of
the earlier, notorious boardroom row in 1973, when the so-called straight
eight directors failed to unseat him over several issues of corporate
governance including excessive expenses. From then on Mr Rowland became a
pariah with the big investment institutions, the insurance companies and
pension funds responsible for most of the net inflow of cash into the equity
market. Yet because he retained the support of small shareholders, Lonrho
was transformed into a perfect illustration of the thesis advanced by the
American academics Berle and Means, who pointed out the consequences of the
divorce between ownership and control.
In contrasting the situation in the early 1930s with the days when
proprietors held enough stock to exert proper control, Berle and Means
showed that the fragmentation of shareholding in the 20th century had
deprived shareholders of power and influence. That was certainly the case at
Lonrho, where earnings stagnated between 1976 and 1987. Today Lonrho has
still not returned to the level of earnings achieved in the upturn that came
to a peak in 1988. Yet Mr Rowland hangs on regardless.
Dismal performance
Elsewhere this dismal performance might have prompted institutional pressure
for boardroom change, because the growth of collective investment is helping
close the gap between legal ownership and control. Yet without enough large
shareholdings at Lonrho until institutional interest recently started to
revive, this was never a possibility. As for the alternative discipline of
the hostile takeover, Lonrho is a highly indigestible target. With so much
of its profits in Africa, and a marked difficulty in generating cash flow,
it would never have been an easy business to refocus.
The recent rise in the share price on hopes of Mr Rowland's enforced
departure suggests that the market regards Lonrho as a vastly more valuable
prospect without the man. Yet, historically, potential bidders who have been
prepared to contemplate heavy exposure to an economic disaster zone like
Africa have always worried about a uniquely African poison pill: the
possible dependence of profits on Mr Rowland's personal relations with black
African leaders. The broad message, if there is one, is that wider share
ownership entails weak accountability and poor corporate governance. The
narrower indisputable one is that Mr Rowland is a spent force in business,
but not in the boardroom.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Just junk the jeito: A look at a Brazilian habit that is
part inducement, part consideration, part bribe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a word newcomers to Brazil learn quickly. It makes them flinch at
first; later it triggers a bead of sweat, and then it brings on a nervous
laugh. It is used sparingly, even by long-term residents, because they sense
its ability to strip away an outsider's defences and launch him, naked, into
the cauldron of Brazilian culture.
The word is jeito and, like a formula for poison it is harmless unless you
know what it means. It is a way or scheme to get around (rather than
confront) a problem in Brazil. It can involve exchanging favours or outright
bribery. And in Brazil there are a lot of problems.
Assume you have arrived in Brazil and want a telephone line. If you approach
the local telephone company, its officials will merely laugh. The waiting
list is a couple of years long, by which time your posting will have ended.
Your options are to keep your sanctity but go without a telephone or, you
are told, there is a jeito - you can 'buy' a black market line for about
Dollars 3,000.
The next problem is to get the service working. Your local telephone company
is happy to activate the line - for the payment of a small jeito. But to
install the actual telephone, the best jeito is to use a private company,
which usually means an off-duty phone engineer.
Now comes the tricky bit. The off-duty engineer who installed the telephone
is not allowed to link your telephone to the activated line. The only way to
get it linked is to call another, on-duty engineer and to pay him a jeito to
go off duty momentarily while he overlooks the fact that your line is black
market and makes the connection.
If this scenario seems unlikely, let's just say it happened to a friend.
The jeito operates in almost every field of Brazilian life and often crosses
into nepotism or corruption. Those in government dispense jeitos to friends
and relatives, helping them find ways around the bureaucracy and to get
jobs. Some argue Brazil's entire political system, based on regional
alliances, would be paralysed without the flows of favour and patronage
between the capital, Brasilia, and the provinces.
No one knows how it started. Some say the jeito was travelling below deck
when the Portuguese arrived nearly 500 years ago. Others argue it grew up in
Brazil, where circumventing colonial law was crucial, given the size of the
country and the many weeks it took central government to relay decisions. A
third school sees the jeito as a Brazilian cultural icon, a fusion of the
Portuguese and west African affinity for compromise.
The jeito may appear harmless abroad, from where it can be shrugged off as
an endearing, faintly exotic aspect of Brazilian life. And it has many
supporters in Brazil who argue it would be a less interesting country if it
emulated northern European morality. Even the most sanctimonious foreigner
soon learns that jeitos seem less naughty the more they are used.
But the time has come to abolish the jeito. This is partly because it is out
of date. Since Brazil's return to democracy 10 years ago, the population has
been demanding more transparency from public officials. Both the
front-running candidates for this year's presidential elections have, for
example, had to dump their running mates over allegations that they used one
jeito too many for personal profit while members of the senate.
But the main reason to ban the jeito is that it, together with high
inflation, forms part of a way of life which has corroded Brazil's social
fabric for decades. Indeed, one particular jeito can be seen as a leading
cause of Brazilian inflation.
Successive generations of politicians abrogated their responsibility to
control spending and price rises. They did so by, among others, trying to
protect wages through the jeito of raising pay in line with inflation
indices. As the rise in the indices accelerated, increases in wages and
other prices became bigger and more frequent, exacerbating the inflationary
mess. In June this year, the monthly inflation rate exceeded 50 per cent.
Brazil is now tackling its inflationary legacy. A new currency launched in
July, called the Real and linked to the US dollar, has led to a sharp drop
in price rises.
Much remains to be done, including overhauls of the tax and social security
systems. But the start has been made, and Brazil finally appears ready to
cast off the stigma of being the last large Latin American economy to bring
inflation under control.
It will only succeed, however, if it sticks to the difficult task of
limiting spending and punishing corruption. It must also refrain from the
temptation to get round today's problems by finding another jeito.

Love him or hate him, Ian Kerr, who penned L'Eminence Noire for the pages of
International Financing Review, the bible of the Euromarkets, brought a
biting wit to the antics of friend and foe.
Since April, when he was lured to rival Euroweek, there has been something
of a void at the staggeringly expensive (Pounds 2,000 plus per annum)
yellow-jacketed weekly.
Re-enter Peter Krijgsman, 39, former editor-in-chief of IFR, who left last
autumn, and has now been rehired as a humble tittle-tattle recycler. Unlike
Kerr, who had headed fixed income research at Kidder Peabody, Krijgsman has
never seen the market from the inside. A some-time diarist at Accountancy
Age - 'funnier than it sounds' - he has his contacts however, not least
Kerr's enemies, from whom he would hear faithfully every Monday morning at
IFR.
But he will have a hard act to follow in the bitchiness and snobbery stakes,
not to mention matching Kerr's penchant for coining nicknames which stick.
CS First Boston's Alan 'Weetabix' Wheat, his spouse Mrs Shredded Wheat, and
Christopher Robin (the gangly new London boss of UBS David Robbins) are just
a few of the big cheeses who have been rechristened by Kerr.
Even so, if Kriegelburger focuses on the current movers and shakers, rather
than yesterday's men, he should be able to mine a tolerably untapped seam.

You can't fault the Italians for entrepreneurial spirit. With the ink hardly
dry on the IRA's ceasefire announcement, the FT's Milan office was rung up
yesterday by one would-be fast food magnate.
The caller, currently employed by a Japanese bank, was wondering how she and
her husband, who works in a TV repair shop, should go about setting
themselves up in Belfast to sell focaccia - a northern Italian pizza-like
dough - to the peaceloving inhabitants.
As it turns out, Sonia Paiatto and Marco Di Fiore had already decided
Belfast was the place for them, ceasefire or no ceasefire, and were
preparing to chuck in their jobs and indulge their passion for cookery. 'We
just went there on holiday and loved it,' explained Paiatto.

Is an interesting culture change imminent at Time magazine, the weekly
flagship of the Time Warner empire?
Norman Pearlstine, former executive editor of the Wall Street Journal, is
being tipped by the New York Times to take over as editor in chief of Time
Inc, the parent of Time, Fortune, Sports Illustrated, and People.
Pearlstine has interesting social and personal connections. His third wife,
Nancy Friday, has made a career from writing up (anonymous) sexual
fantasies. Her My Secret Garden (1979) regaled us with women's imaginings,
while Men in Love (1980) crossed the gender divide for the same purpose.
Francis Dealy, in his entertaining book The Power and The Money, Inside the
Wall Street Journal, quotes Pearlstine saying to him that Nancy had
'emotionally emancipated' him.
Pearlstine is far too glitzy to be mistaken for another Henry Luce. Even so,
Time hacks might welcome his arrival if he puts a stop to the long running
rumours that the mags are up for sale.
Indeed, Dealy reckons that when Pearlstine took over as managing editor of
the WSJ, in the first 10 months he incurred Dollars 11.4m in unexpected
salary costs, by hiring 143 new staff instead of the budgeted 36.
Dust off those CVs. . .

A symbolic choice, perhaps, given the coincidence with the IRA's ceasefire.
Littlewood's piece begins with a flush of nationalism at the outbreak of the

FT  02 SEP 94 / Observer: Hanson goes exploring
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rarely does a humble hack get to fly in one of Lord Hanson's helicopter
fleet.
But yesterday Observer temporarily joined the elite, visiting Air Hanson's
swish base in Surrey, for the launch of a new and rather special McDonnell
Douglas chopper.
A technologically impressive beast, the MD Explorer will be distributed in
the UK and elsewhere by Air Hanson. Its big novelty is the lack of a
tail-rotor. Given that 20 per cent of helicopter accidents are caused by the
tail-rotor, which is also a very noisy component, it should be a big selling
point.
With no tail-rotor, US police and military can sneak up on the bad guys, at
a price-they-like, with running costs of Dollars 375 per hour against a
minimum of Dollars 500 for tail-rotor competitors. How come nobody has
thought of it before?
Ah, but they have: 'I saw some photos of a Russian trial version back in the
70's, but nothing since then,' says an MD executive. Of course, the proof of
the pudding is in the eating.
Sadly, Observer can't tell you just how quiet the Explorer is since
yesterday's chopper flight was grounded, thanks to a missing vital part.
However, McDonnell Douglas has promised Hanson that the rogue item will be
found in time for next week's international air show at Farnborough.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Hot under the collar of the law: Fast-growing, unregulated
security groups are causing concern in the UK industry - and the police
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you want to know the time ask a policeman, advised the old music hall
song.
How things have changed. Telling people the time is not an activity
requiring the commitment of expensive, highly-trained police. Neither, the
UK government may be about to conclude, are more important activities such
as checking fingerprints, tracing missing persons or monitoring automatic
speed-check equipment.
The Home Office is currently completing an internal review of specific
policing functions as part of the government's review of public expenditure.
Although ministers say this will not necessarily lead to changes in police
responsibilities, the service is not convinced. Officers suspect the review
will prove the prelude to market testing and the transfer of 'ancillary'
tasks to the private or voluntary sectors.
Events have not awaited the review's completion. Last week's announcement by
Wandsworth council in London that it was considering extending its uniformed
parks patrols to housing estates has sparked debate about the
appropriateness of assigning policing duties to individuals who lack the
training and status of police officers.
Controversy over Wandsworth's plan is in the detail - specifically its
suggestion that patrols, with the powers of constables, should be sworn in
by magistrates - rather than the substance. The Association of Chief Police
Officers said patrolling was 'one of the most difficult jobs which police
officers are asked to undertake' and should not be attempted by
under-qualified individuals.
Several local authorities have, without arousing opposition, begun using
uniformed personnel to combat crime, while private security staff are
increasingly deployed on guarding activities that bring them into contact
with the public.
Completion of the review may mark the beginning of a government attempt to
formalise such activities. But such a move would face practical hurdles that
could, surprisingly, include reluctance of leading private security
companies to take on duties that the government might want to offload.
Other problems include doubts among senior police officers about the ability
of the private sector to give an adequate service and political arguments
about taking police activities out of the state's hands.
Reputable security companies believe that the opportunities created in a
fast growing sector are leading to an influx of 'cowboy' operators whose
disreputable, or incompetent activities, reflect badly on the entire
industry.
The UK market for private security, already one of Europe's biggest, is
growing with the introduction of private management of prisons and rising
demands for security guards at shopping malls, industrial estates and other
locations.
According to a study last month for the Economic and Social and Research
Council, the sector employs at least 162,000 people. This would make the
sector as big in employment terms as the police. The core security guarding
market is worth about Pounds 1bn a year.
Information is short because the industry lacks statutory regulation. Anyone
with a van, a mobile telephone and a convincing-looking dog can set up a
security company. Cynics add that a criminal record is no impediment.
Reputable companies deplore the absence of regulation. The British Security
Industries Association, which represents most of the leading operators,
senior police officers and opposition MPs all support statutory regulation
and licensing of security companies.
The government has rejected such demands for action. It prefers
self-regulation and has told industry representatives that licensing would
favour bigger companies and so be anti-competitive. It is not convinced that
'cowboys' are more prevalent than in any other sector. Leaders of the
industry may, however, insist on regulation to control rogue operators as
the price for taking on any police duties.
Even with statutory controls, some security company managers share chief
constables' reservations about the implications of transferring police work
to the private sector. Mr David Dickinson, director of security company
Group 4, told the Association of Chief Police Officers last month that the
role of security companies must be confined to crime prevention and not
stray into the area of law enforcement. He fears that the public would fail
to understand a blurring of the edges between companies such as his and the
police.
Setting a limit on the role of security companies would, however, allow
scope for imaginative developments in joint working between the public and
private sectors. Some police forces, Mr Dickinson says, already employ
private security companies to guard their own headquarters. He suggests the
police should consider whether to spend some of their budgets on buying in
'preventative uniformed patrols in the community under the total control of
the chief constable'.
Chief constables' control is likely to emerge as a central theme in the
police service's response to any government attempts to introduce a greater
private role in policing.
The service is unhappy about the prospect of two-tier policing - it holds
passionately to the view that whenever a police officer walks along a street
he or she might be confronted with any number of emergencies, and must be
trained and equipped for them all. But if the private security industry won
statutory regulation, police confidence in it would increase. That would put
pressure on chief constables to become managers of a 'mixed economy' of
policing.
They could, in a pattern becoming increasingly familiar in the public
sector, retain overall responsibility for activities carried out under
contract by other agencies. There is a precedent for this: chief constables
are now responsible for the management of large numbers of civilian staff
recruited in recent years to relieve police officers of behind-the-scenes
support duties such as running control rooms.
A 'mixed economy' approach was proposed last month by an independent inquiry
into police roles and responsibilities initiated by two academic bodies, the
Police Foundation and the Policy Studies Institute. It raised the
possibility of street patrols run by local authorities, community groups or
private security companies, operating under the direction of the regular
police. Such support groups could, suggested the inquiry, relieve the police
of administrative burdens such as delivering summonses or making inquiries
about under-age drinking in public houses.
The inquiry's ideas have alarmed the Police Federation, which represents the
rank and file. 'It is estimated that the police service costs about 31p a
day per head of population,' says Mr Fred Broughton, its chairman. 'By
raising public spending by a few pence per head, it would be possible to put
more police officers on the streets. They would be real, fully-trained
officers capable of dealing with everything that arose, unlike the
alternative patrols that are being considered.'
The federation scorns the idea of substituting police officers with
lower-cost replacements; but there are fears in Britain's police stations
that some chief constables, who are about to become more accountable under
fixed-term contracts, may be attracted to it as a means of trying to meet
and finance public demand for more street patrols.
As last week's reaction to the Wandsworth plan showed, transferring police
duties to other providers generates ethical and constitutional concerns.
Such worries have not been a obstacle before in the government's law and
order policies. The introduction of private prison management was not halted
by the argument of opponents that only state employees, untouched by the
profit motive, should be allowed to deprive individuals of their liberty.
Having failed to deflect ministers on that issue, critics could not with
equal seriousness claim that it would be an outrage for charities to become
responsible for lost dogs, or private security companies or motoring
organisations to escort wide loads along motorways.
But the argument does not end there. Those activities most suited to
contracting out - from lost property to routine patrols - are the ones that
bring ordinary citizens into most contact with the police service. Take them
away, and where does it leave the regular, front-line police? As an
increasingly remote, heavily armed, centrally deployed force, say critics -
some of them in the police service itself.
This raises big constitutional questions. Yet they may not be heard amid the
clamour from a public that wants more visible protection from burglars, car
thieves and muggers, and is not particularly concerned whether the
protectors wear the uniforms of the police, Securicor or the local council.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Personal View: 'Gatting' the Greens - Environmentalists must
live with trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAYTON YEUTTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recent congressional debate might suggest to most Americans that trade and
environmental policies are incompatible. Some environmental groups fear that
decisions made by the World Trade Organisation may force a 'lowest common
denominator' reduction in environmental protection in the US and elsewhere.
Proponents of trade expansion are equally worked up, fearing inclusion of
environmental issues on the WTO agenda will add burdensome delays and
complexities to trade policy decision-making.
Both sides are over-reacting. There is no inherent conflict between
environmental protection and open trade; they are not mutually exclusive
goals. There is nothing in General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade rules -
rules soon to be assumed by Gatt's successor organisation, the WTO - that
precludes consideration of environmental issues during a multilateral
negotiation. The more relevant question is whether those issues are ripe for
negotiation on a global basis. A second, and perhaps even more relevant,
question is whether those who seek consideration of environmental issues
have as their primary motivation protecting the environment, or impeding
trade.
The challenge for international environmental policy is to strike a sensible
balance between economic development/job creation/trade expansion, on the
one hand, and environmental protection on the other. In recent years most
environmental organisations have begun to embrace market-based solutions to
environmental issues, recognising that markets and growth are not generally
inconsistent with environmental protection. There remains, however, a cadre
of hard-core activists who view command-and-control regulation as the only
legitimate environmental policy, and who also view economic growth as an
enemy of the environment. This hard-core group seems bent on enshrining
unilateral trade retaliation, extraterritorial regulation, and unfettered
regulatory sovereignty as the cornerstone of US trade and environmental
policy.
Painting the new WTO as a 'Gattzilla' out to devour the environment, as some
environmental groups have done, trivialises the challenge of determining how
best to mesh environmental protection with economic growth and trade
expansion throughout the world. That answer is not to be found in a massive
global environmental bureaucracy, nor in unilateral imposition of US
environmental standards on developing countries; citizens of the third world
are not about to be consigned to a future as hewers of wood and drawers of
water. The answer must be found through multilateral consensus within Gatt
(and then the WTO).
Gatt is already addressing many of these difficult and vital issues. The
present agreement specifically permits nations to take measures to protect
the environment, so long as they are aimed at conservation of exhaustible
natural resources and are taken in conjunction with restrictions on domestic
production or consumption.
This is broad language, and it has been interpreted broadly. Too often the
positive side of Gatt's record on environmental issues has been overlooked.
Gatt has clearly stated that a nation may have more demanding environmental
standards than those in other countries - so long as they are not more trade
restrictive than necessary. Gatt has also ruled that nations may take
balanced action for conservation of natural resources outside their borders
and that restrictions may be imposed to conserve a natural resource even if
its stocks are not presently depleted. Gatt thus encourages nations to
conserve resources for future generations.
Just recently the Gatt established a special committee on trade and the
environment. It will study and report (to the new WTO) on a whole range of
environmental issues of concern to US business, including the trade effects
of packaging and labelling requirements, product standards, and
environmental charges. The US trade representative will also have an
advisory committee on the environment to examine similar issues.
The WTO must eventually confront these issues - in a manner compatible with
Gatt's historic objective of opening trade. WTO member nations must act
objectively and systematically, lest they seriously jeopardise a
half-century of progress in liberalising trade. The US, as a leader in the
WTO and a force for both open trade and environmental protection, should
nurture this process, helping its fellow WTO members to avoid premature,
capricious judgments concerning the future interrelation of the environment
and trade.
All this is relevant to the present debate over giving the President 'fast
track' authority to negotiate environmental agreements. We simply do not yet
know whether it would be in the self-interest of the US to negotiate on
these issues, and we certainly do not yet know what our specific negotiating
objectives would be. Most other nations are not nearly as far along on the
'negotiating curve' as we are. After the recently established committee on
trade and the environment reports its findings, interested parties in all
nations can assess whether new trade/environmental negotiations are
appropriate. If so, let's negotiate; if not, the WTO can and will move on to
other issues.
The Gatt accord now before Congress will allow an individual WTO member to
impose higher product standards than other nations so long as the standards
are based on sound science. The US supports this concept, for it encourages
environmental stewardship, but we need to make sure that 'high' standards
are not used simply to gain an unfair competitive advantage.
Standards that cannot be supported scientifically will properly be subject
to WTO challenge. Bad science is too often just disguised protectionism.
Good science will improve public health and environmental quality around the
globe, and it will also enhance the credibility of its proponent
organisations.
Only through multilateral consensus can the US achieve meaningful change in
international trade rules or global environmental standards. The US cannot
mandate standards, because the Gatt - to the frequent benefit of the US -
has traditionally operated by consensus. (Though that could change under the
WTO, it is unlikely to do so except on rare occasions.) Therefore, the key
to success is to negotiate and negotiate well.
If we have unrealistic negotiating objectives in these new areas, the
negotiations will not succeed. That would do nothing to protect the
environment. But we can work through the WTO and other international bodies
to convince other nations of our positions and to encourage the adoption of
sound principles to improve environmental protection.
Reducing trade barriers in industrial countries will also encourage
developing countries to raise their own standards of environmental
protection. Nations devote more attention to protecting the environment as
they become richer. As a middle class emerges and grows, demands for
protection of the environment increase. We should work with this trend, not
against it.
In short, we need to 'Gatt' the greens, not 'green' the Gatt. Multilateral
co-operation on issues affecting trade and the environment will offer a
stronger and more secure basis for environmental protection than ad hoc,
politically charged actions by individual nations, however well intentioned.
Those of us who have worked on trade issues for many years do not believe
that open trade and environmental protection are inconsistent goals. We look
to the future with confidence that the WTO will properly mesh legitimate
objectives in both areas.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Waiting for the workers' harvest: a look at attempts to
update UK trade unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trade unionism in Britain is like a pruned back plant poised for a new burst
of growth.' The 1,000 delegates assembling this weekend in Blackpool for the
126th gathering of the Trades Union Congress may draw comfort from the words
of Mr John Monks, TUC general-secretary. But could the TUC's modernising
leader just be whistling to keep their - and his - spirits up?
The immediate outlook for trade unionism, as he himself acknowledges, is not
good. Membership has continued to decline, by 400,000 to 7.2m, over the past
year despite the fact that unemployment started to fall. Long-term trends
contributing to the decline of unions and collective bargaining - the shift
from manufacturing to services and the shrinking size of the average
workplace - persist.
Nevertheless, TUC delegates can find some reasons for feeling cheerful. The
arrival of Mr Monks, who only took over from the unappealing Mr Norman
Willis last year, has almost certainly improved the public standing of the
TUC and unions in general.
He has reorganised the TUC to give it a sharper focus; attempts to
reposition it as a non-party political lobbying organisation for all
employees are begining to take effect. The arrival of Mr Michael Portillo as
employment secretary may reduce the scope for dialogue with the government.
But Mr Monks can develop further his friendly relationship with the
Confederation of British Industry and later this month he will be the first
TUC general secretary to address meetings at the Liberal Democrat and
Conservative conferences.
Best of all for the unions as a whole, the biggest challenge they faced for
years has been surmounted with relative ease. Recent legislation has
required them to obtain positive consent from members before employers can
'check off' union subscriptions from pay packets, in effect requiring unions
to re-recruit the 80 per cent of members who pay union fees this way.
Overall, TUC-affiliated union membership may shrink by about 500,000 as a
result.
But for the first time in 15 years, the movement can look the government in
the eye and state that its core membership is real and voluntary.
But in spite of Mr Monks's personal achievements, his attempts to modernise
the union movement may be insufficient to stem long-term decline. In
addition his reforms face opposition from within union ranks.
Some of the more conservative union bosses have not grasped that
European-style social partnership - which the TUC leadership regards as
providing a new lease of life for the movement - requires changes from them
too. There could be rows at the Congress on the policy of supporting
workplace rights for all workers, rather than just union members, and on the
shift to a less politically partisan stance.
Mr Monks's modernisation strategy has few reliable allies in the big unions,
while the TUC's two biggest affiliates - Unison, the public service union,
and the TGWU general union - remain consumed by splits between different
internal factions.
Further, some old fashioned problems could be looming. Several unions are
facing financial difficulties, none more than the heavily-indebted building
union Ucatt. Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, says the
fortunes of the unions no longer rise and fall together and that it is now a
question of the 'survival of the fittest'.
Another echo of the past could be a revival of strike action. Mr Jimmy
Knapp, chairman of this year's Congress and leader of the embattled RMT rail
union, is enjoying strong public backing for his striking signal workers.
But the relative popularity of unions may be because strikes are so rare. A
renewed bout of militancy over wages, often predicted in the course of the
recovery, could undermine the support unions have begun to enjoy. So, too,
could possible large-scale disputes over compulsory redundancies at British
Telecommunications or British Gas, which could cause much disruption for the
public.
Worst of all for the future of the unions, there is no sign at the workplace
that employees are turning to them for support in the face of increased
labour market insecurity.
Unions are failing to improve their record in the recruitment of women or
part-time workers. Only 21 per cent of part-timers are in unions compared
with 37 per cent of full-timers, while the proportion of women workers in
unions fell last year to 30 per cent.
There is also no evidence that employees who are not covered by collective
bargaining agreements are starting to join unions as an insurance policy,
for legal help and advice on subjects such as pensions.
Despite these obstacles to renewal the unions are not completely helpless.
They can look to two outside sources for help - the European Union and the
Labour party.
The EU is already passing union-friendly legislation in areas from health
and safety to works councils for consulting workers. And although the EU's
social dimension is not expected to produce much new legislation for a few
years, there is still plenty in the pipeline for organised labour to welcome
 -despite the UK's opt-out from the social chapter.
But for an actual increase in union membership, or even for an end to
persistent decline, a Labour victory at the next general election is a
necessity. Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader has talked about treating unions
as just another pressure group. He will be anxious not to play into the
hands of a Conservative party which will point to the apparent tension
between Labour's commitment to full employment and its union-inspired
policies on minimum wages and workers' rights. But a new right to represent
workers, stopping short of full union recognition, is certain to appear in
Labour's manifesto. 'That would open the door for us to show that we can
help workers in difficulty,' says Mr Edmonds.
UK trade unionism may be a pruned-back plant but it is still waiting for
fertilisation from outside.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Weakness of European defence industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAIN DECKERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Lex is right to argue that the consolidation of the US defence industry
sets a challenge to Europe's defence industry ('Allied forces', August 31).
Yet this trend has been ongoing for a number of years, and the European
defence industry's reply has been less than wholehearted.
The fact is that it remains hopelessly fragmented, largely for political
reasons. European companies which have undertaken cross-border mergers
(Matra Marconi Space, Eurocopter) have been slow to implement unified
management structures while others continue to engage in endless
negotiations before embarking upon them (British Aerospace Dynamics and
Matra Defence). This compares unfavourably to US deals which are clinched in
months not years.
Furthermore, the Groupement d'Interet Economique, which is so prevalent in
the European defence industry, tends to perpetuate national reporting
systems and duplication of effort. While second and third-tier suppliers
have fared somewhat better, the picture in European defence R&amp;D is equally
incoherent, being dominated by a host of bilateral treaties and ad hoc
collaborative projects with little or no co-ordination among them.
Previous attempts to provide a blueprint for a competitive European defence
equipment market, such as the Independent European Programme Group's 1988
Action Plan, have lacked any credibility since they did not include a
supranational executive agency which could force national governments to
act. Yet deregulation and rationalisation of the European defence agency are
desperately needed.
If European governments do not wish to abolish article 223 of the Treaty of
Rome and thereby give the European Commission oversight over the defence
industry, it is at least incumbent upon them to find an alternative
organisation which could fulfil this role. The western European Armaments
Group seems the only credible candidate, and steps in this direction need to
be urgently revitalised.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Thompson-Noel is, as a travel writer, entitled to his
subjective views about Great Yarmouth ('The English coast and its holidays
from hell', August 27/28). However, I am surprised that you have allowed him
to muddle these with what purports to be a business assessment of the state
of England's tourism and its resorts.
He tells us that we have lost our soul to 'naffness'. The bits in between
(the resorts) are 'often occupied by drab caravan parks'. If he had bothered
to go and look at these caravan parks and holiday centres he would have
found a number of thriving businesses and would have seen the result of many
years of steady investment by both national operators such as Pontins, Haven
and Warner and by private operators such as, in the Great Yarmouth area,
Potters, Blue Sky (the Timewell family), Cherry Tree (the Marsh family), or
Vauxhall. In any of these caravan holiday parks he would have found a wide
range of sporting facilities, indoor and outdoor swimming pools and, most
importantly, a variety of evening entertainment that he would not have found
at twice the price in France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Morocco,
Tunisia, Bermuda, the Caribbean, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, the
Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Mexico, California, Canada or even
Scotland]
Adele Biss, chairman of the British Tourist Authority and of the English
Tourist Board, was right to highlight some of the problems that our holiday
industry faces in her introduction to the ETB's annual report. I prefer this
honesty to the over-optimistic messages put out by some of her predecessors.
There still could be a further contraction in hotel accommodation in
resorts. But standards are improving. There is a need for more imaginative
use of parasols, wind-breaks and deckchairs to make our beaches attractive
in the way that the Belgians and the Dutch achieve with the same climate as
we have.
But there is life yet in England's seaside resorts and Financial Times
readers should be aware that there is still money to be made there too] Mr
Thompson-Noel would do well to reflect on what would be the effect on the
national parks of the resorts closing down and all those who holiday there
following him to the countryside.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Perverse argument
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER BENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The concluding paragraph of your editorial 'Venturing Capital' (August
30) surprised me. 'Generating more investment in small enterprises. .
.cannot in itself be regarded as a sane objective' looks perverse, when
earlier you point out some of the peculiar problems that small companies
face in raising funds. If the cost of due diligence is high in relation to
the sums invested, surely that argues for an enhanced return after a
successful investment? No one doubts the contribution that small business
can make to the economy; it seems a pity that so many hopeful enterprises
are strangled at birth.
Of course fiscal treatment is only part of the solution; the availability of
quality information on investment opportunities is also crucial. That is
what we are trying to promote.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Japan economy theory needs further
analysis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER MCGREGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Martin Wolf's latest theory (Economic Eye, August 29) that the way to
have a successful economy is to run a large trade deficit with Japan would
be more convincing if he had analysed the imports of countries like
Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia to discover how much of these were
semi-manufactures from Japan to be completed with low cost labour and
re-exported to the west. As it happens, the situation in Malaysia appeared
in your survey (August 30), in which it was reported that typical products
have 60 or 70 per cent of the value added in Japan or the US, a balance
which the Malaysians are trying to change. What this means is intermediary
'Wolf-successful' countries merely provide cover for a Japanese trade
surplus with the west which is even larger than the statistics show.
His suggestion that 'sophisticated econometrics does not support the belief
that (Japan's) imports are smaller than might reasonably be expected' also
needs to be looked at critically, since studies in depth on the ground tell
quite a different story, as was demonstrated for the construction industry
in 1990. Incidentally, I am disappointed to find that Wolf is not the
simple-minded free trader that l had always assumed, but a believer in
sophisticated econometrics. This has the great danger of substituting a
delight in the process for a hard look at the facts.
No doubt he will be telling us next that the Japanese are not Keynesians.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Arts: Art among the ruins - The Obala group from Sarajevo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This has been a good festival for the Demarco European Art Foundation,
housed for the moment in the former St Marys School. The building is
overflowing with activity in every corner. So far, one show, Mirjam by
Mariela Stefanski, has won a Fringe First award, Damien Hirst's rats have
grabbed lots of welcome headlines, and Romeo and Juliet by the Estonian
Youth Theatre is proving a festival favourite. But perhaps the most notable
achievement is the appearance of the group of artists from the Obala Gallery
in Sarajevo which has finally managed to bring its exhibition Witnesses of
Existence to the festival.
Invited by Richard Demarco last year, the group was unable to get permits to
leave the city. This year, with the help of a sympathetic officer, the
artists have been able to get out on UN flights and have taken the show to
New York and Switzerland before arriving in Edinburgh.
Demarco's interest in eastern Europe is no new phenomenon. The idea for the
present show was born when Demarco took a group of Scottish artists to
Sarajevo in February 1988. He says, 'I believe we must listen to all the
languages of Europe . . . Here we bridge the gap between the world of art
and the world of reality . . . around the heart of Europe which is bleeding.
Our life as artists is about confronting the issue of the creation of gaps,
failing to make contact.'
The visiting Sarajevan artists agree with this sentiment, but their position
is difficult. After discussion, it was agreed that it would be in everyone's
best interests if two Serbian theatre companies originally scheduled to
appear at the Foundation staged their performances elsewhere, and a new
venue was found. 'Being anti-war is not enough,' the exhibition co-ordinator
Izeta Gradevic told me. 'You have to be against the camps, ethnic cleansing,
everything. Our group is completely mixed, we are a Bosnian group. But art
is not divided from politics.'
Demarco believes that education is the vital factor in making art the force
for good in our lives, and hopes that the Foundation can remain permanently
at the school as a sort of international interdisciplinary university.
'Most people are so simple, their lives are about absurdities, and that is
our problem - it is a question of education, of giving people more than they
have been given. When we understand that culture and education are two sides
of the same coin, we will not have a Ministry of Culture and a Ministry of
Education, we will have civilisation.'
The experience of the Obala Gallery artists would seem to confirm that art
can have a life enhancing role no matter how atrocious the circumstances of
its creation. When what was to have been their new gallery space was
destroyed by shelling before they had moved into it in spring 1992, they
decided to exhibit their work there anyway, and organised a group show in
December in the ruins of the basement.
Meanwhile, the basement had become a safe passage for pedestrians across an
intersection notorious for sniper fire. The artists' diary of the exhibition
has photographs showing passers-by, one still in a crouching run, one
clutching a loaded shopping bag, staring in amazement at them calmly
arrranging their work. 'The artists wanted to keep it as a space for
spirituality . . .' Izeta Gradevic explained, and their installations among
the ruins, some of which have now been brought to Edinburgh, became an
affirmation of the determination to be civilised, to behave above all with
decency and dignity, which was coming under such brutal attack. 'People were
surprised and happy, they were crying at the opening. When you have no food,
no water, no electricity, people used to say is art so important? Now they
do not ask that question.'
Witnesses of Existence comes to the Atlantis Gallery, London, in December.

<TEXT>
People come, people go. (Nothing ever happens in Grand Hotel.) They have
their exits and their entrances. Time passes. Peter Handke's play The Hour
We Knew Nothing of Each Other has stage directions but no words. And its top
layer - as realised by Luke Bondy's staging for the Schaubuhne am Leitner
Platz, Berlin, now at the Edinburgh Festival Theatre - is an absurdist study
in character.
Individuals cross the stage, each revealing some different peculiarity; and
many of the vignettes concerning them are funny. There are the four
Austrian-type tourists, determinedly trekking along against all odds,
beaming their wonder; the two old peasant women pushing shopping-trolleys;
the lone male roller skater who finds time to stroke his hair oh so casually
and then glides offstage in a sudden arabesque; the SAS-type soldiers who
zoom perilously onto the stage and straight off again; a Tarzan who swings
onto the stage and then walks across it like an ape; a Papageno, whistling
appropriate tunes by Mozart, with his birdcage, who gets clobbered by a
harmless-looking gent carrying a huge pack of nappies.
All of them look as if they were New Yorker cartoons. But the fun of a
cartoon is that it is one frozen moment out of time. The Hour We Knew
Nothing of Each Other, however, is 120 minutes long. And it soon adds up to
a view of the world - a world peopled by oddballs, where nothing has rhyme
or reason, where noises off (guns? bombs?) frighten everyone into defensive
posture.
The mood only darkens after an hour or more, although you know from one look
at Gilles Aillaud's elegant after-Magritte set that darkness will descend.
An Egyptian dog-deity on a plinth; an old car half-covered by a dust-sheet;
a blue horizon; a manhole; an incomplete white wall . . . The fact that
these scenic elements do not add up to anything coherent is, of course, the
whole point.
Let nobody think that any of this is the least bit original, by the way. The
shape of it is extremely reminiscent of many Merce Cunningham works, and
many of its comic anecdotes have been prefigured in any number of ballets by
Jerome Robbins. And the Dadaist feel of it all, the collection of bizarre
human eccentricities, derives from such Pina Bausch works as 1980.
So why do I find so much less merit in Handke's play than in these works it
so resembles? He is only interested in external differences. Whereas
Cunningham honours human potential and makes it large and complex, Handke
knocks it down to size and makes it pointless. Even Bausch, to whose
Teutonic spirit he is much closer, is more interested in the urgent internal
forces that motor the unhappy crazies she puts onstage. Handke's play is the
hour we knew nothing of each other - and cared less.
At the Edinburgh Festival Theatre till September 3

FT  02 SEP 94 / Arts: Record for Edinburgh - Sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arts sponsorship was late into the recession, but seems to be coming out of
it quite smartly - at least in Edinburgh. The 1994 festival, which closes
tomorrow, attracted 15 per cent more corporate support than last year, with
a record total of Pounds 1m. The money is vital - it accounts for 20 per
cent of festival revenue. Only half the aid goes in straightforward arts
sponsorship. The remainder is donations from trusts and individuals and from
the corporate membership scheme, where companies are tempted to form a
festival connection for as little as Pounds 2,500. Edinburgh hopes to sign
up more London-based companies, Whitbread and Bats are recent additions.
The increase in sponsorship owes something to renewed business confidence
and more to the fact that the festival is enjoying an artistic revival under
director Brian MacMaster. This does not mean that his ambitious
presentations, like a seven and a half hour Oresteia in Russian, are
enthusiastically embraced by sponsors - this year's challenging foreign
drama productions failed to get backers. But they did receive a good
critical response and this raised the prestige of Edinburgh.
Predictably, sponsors at the festival are motivated mainly by the corporate
hospitality opportunities - IBM flew in 200 top executives from Europe for
its sponsored concert of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony - but the festival's
development director, John Godfrey, is trying hard to broaden their
horizons. He made some progress this year when one longterm sponsor, the
Royal Bank of Scotland, added advertising of its connection and competitions
for tickets, to his traditional format. Another leading sponsor, Hertz,
which sponsored Miami City Ballet, invested some of its money in an
educational project, with dancers visiting local schools.
The Royal Bank of Scotland was quick to exploit the festival's newest
attraction, the Festival Theatre, and put Pounds 60,000 behind the opening
production there, Beethoven's Fidelio. In contrast, events at the other main
festival venue, the Usher Hall, commanded a sponsorship tag of Pounds
30,000. The festival, like every other arts organisation these days, is open
to offers on the size of a sponsor's commitment.
This flexibility brings in the newer, more experimental companies, like
Beck's Beer, which was willing to put some money behind one of the most
elitist festival events, the Canadian director Robert Lepage's new work, The
Seven Streams of the River Ota. Even so the festival still relies on local
banks, utilities and breweries for most of its sponsorship income.
Like other arts organisations, the Edinburgh Festival is alive to the
opportunities in payment in kind. But Godfrey is not soft-headed - there is
no airline tie-in this year because he was not prepared to give Pounds
30,000 worth of sponsorship privileges to an airline in return for the
equivalent in full price tickets. It is better to do a deal elsewhere - with
InterCity, for example - and buy air tickets for artists when needed from
discount sources.
Hertz gives some of its support in kind as well as cash, and in return for
inclusion in the Corporate Membership Scheme Strathmore Spring Water is
supplying 8,000 litres of the stuff. Famous Grouse ensures that every
performer at the festival receives a bottle of whisky.
Godfrey is adept at persuading major arts supporters to at least do
something in Edinburgh. British Gas is currently re-examining its
sponsorship programme but has agreed to pay for the video that will promote
sponsorship of next year's festival, when the target is Pounds 1.2m.
The habit of using festival events to entertain means that most companies
double their expenditure by the end of the day, when the costs of parties,
accommodation etc, are added in. Godfrey hopes that the example of Beck's
will persuade sponsors to go for more avant-garde happenings in 1995 and
that the lead from the Royal Bank of Scotland will encourage them to exploit
the link more imaginatively. But one thing stays inviolate - Brian MacMaster
plans his festivals with sponsors firmly out of mind. Only when the
programme is fixed are they invited to pick it over.

Tom Vernon says that a bicycle is not for going places, a bicycle is for
stopping, and that principle has already led to him presenting a string of
entertaining series. If you feel, as I do, that Fat Man In France which
begins this evening must be a repeat, the reason is that Vernon began as a
radio person and won awards for his 'Fat Man On A Bicycle' series which did,
indeed, include France. He begins his television series, now as director and
producer as well as presenter, in Brittany (7.30 BBC1). It sounded as though
Channel 4 had invented yet another way of avoiding the word 'repeat' when it
decided to call five programmes from the early 1960s The Lost Betjemans, but
there does seem to be some justification in this instance. Devoted to five
towns in the west country, they have not previously been nationally
networked. They begin (8.00) with Marlborough where the poet went to school.
The third series tonight depending upon the eye of the idiosyncratic
onlooker is Michael Moore's TV Nation (9.30 BBC2). It investigates the
peculiar passion of so many ex public schoolboys for the swish of bamboo on
buttock.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you plan an Edinburgh evening wisely, you can see at the Assembly Rooms
Anorak of Fire, followed immediately by The Fabulous Lypsinka Show. The two
shows are so completely in contrast that the juxtaposition is very
satisfying. Anorak is male, English, naive, inhibited; Lypsinka is female,
American, sophisticated, full-out. Anorak has been around for a year and has
many cult followers; but oh, Lypsinka]
I must explain that I do not call Lypsinka female in the most literal sense.
She is John Epperson, who is both writer and performer, and she not only
transcends the camp drag act she performs, she actually makes a searing
feminist point. She is extremely funny, but she repeatedly wipes the
laughter off your face.
Like so many drag artists, Lypsinka reproduces feminine glamour, but what
makes her so original is that she is all about reproducing femininity. She
mimes to a tape that is a brilliant collage of quotes and acts by a hundred
different American popular divas of stage, screen and cabaret, and as her
act proceeds it becomes a study in the desperation of trying to fit the
image of femininity.
There are the desperations of the drag artist trying to fake femininity; of
the woman trying to fake diva glamour; of the diva trying to maintain
glamour. And all of it for the sake of men. Or is it? Within Lypsinka the
vamp lies Lypsinka the man-hater that bursts out to the stabbing shrieks of
Psycho-type music. The two faces of her persona are, deep down, different
faces of the same attitude: desperation again, arising from her need to
thrill men, to obtain men, to live for men, and from her plight of never
finding Mr Right, of being wronged by Mr Wrong.
One moment she is performing to 'The things I've done to make you love me',
the next to 'Isn't it plain, I can't bear to be handled. Don't touch me.'
The quick alternation is hilarious, and at the same time, horrifying. The
artifice of glamour becomes more and more obvious, and the torture of
striving for perpetual chic becomes more alarming. And yet, despite
yourself, you laugh.
Is it possible to be both camp and innocent? The Topp Twins, from New
Zealand, manage it. Their show has now ended at the Traverse, but I loved it
and I hope Britain sees them again soon.
In their late-night show, Camping Out, they welcomed us to the Happy Valley
Camping Ground. One of them was called Camp Mother, the other Camp Leader.
If you put Dame Edna into Hi-de-Hi], you might begin to get an idea. 'We're
going to try something tonight we haven't tried in a long time,' Camp Mother
announces, 'We call it audience participation. You call it fear.' And soon
we were singing camp songs, up onstage playing camp games, and several of us
ate camp food. We knew it was safe, because we had watched Camp Mother
frying it.
The innocent fun of it never palled. But what made Camping Out something
rare was its sheer professionalism - the Topp Twins are very good singers -
and the detail with which they built up their characters. Camp Mother and
Camp Leader are both relentlessly jolly, bespectacled, spinsters. Camp
Mother throws herself into camp activities with immense vim. In consequence,
she has to keep briskly readjusting her boob-tube. Camp Leader is more
tongue-tied and nervous, but gets terribly over-excited. She grins
awkwardly, her little tongue flickers out like a snake's, she blinks rinkles
her nose. Then at last she gets to have the stage to herself for two
minutes. 'I'd like to point out how mahvellous Camp Mother has been this
year,' she says with a nervous giggle. 'She had more than her share of
heartbreak last year, you see. Well,' (conspiratorially) 'as a matter of
fact,' (chortle) 'she get jilted]' For a moment Camp Leader is convulsed in
glee.
Another fringe highlight is The Big Window, a 100-minute musical at Theatre
Workshop performed by an Anglo-American cast of 10 and band of three. This
is a delicate, sophisticated piece which deals with heartbreak and sexual
confusion in an urban milieu.
The music, composed by Linda Dowdell, is in an eclectic vein of high jazz.
The words, by Kate Browne, have a fine talent for light irony. 'You and I
have known each other a long, long time. We are, if I remember correctly,
even married.' And she and Dowdell have so collaborated that the words move
into haunting Gertrude-Stein-type cycles: 'Perhaps she said perhaps.' There
is a wide panoply of rhythm, some deft choreography by Kraig Patterson, but
the most exciting thing of all is that Dowdell shows a very rare instinct
for word-setting. In ensembles, in solos, in high-jumping vocal lines, she
plants words with exceptional clarity and to great effect. While you
applaud, you hope this is the embryo of some larger project.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Arts: 'Oh What a Lovely War' revived
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There must a distinction between those who remember the original, explosive
production of Joan Littlewood's Oh What a Lovely War at Stratford East just
over 30 years ago and those seeing the piece for the first time in the
revival by the National Youth Theatre. By comparison, the NYT performance
understandably lacks fire-power.
Yet there are compensations and even the odd improvement. One of the opening
songs, 'We don't want to lose you, but we think you ought to go', is
immensely moving precisely because it is played by such young people.
The build-up of the songs is a reminder of what a musical masterpiece Ms
Littlewood produced. They go from confidence to doubt to near despair. In 'A
long way to Tipperary' there seems to be a new emphasis in the line 'but
we're not downhearted yet'. In 'Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag',
they are still trying to force a smile. It's a long from 1914 to 'I want to
go home, Oh my, I don't want to die'.
The dialogue scenes are generally less confident. The NYT cast cannot really
pull off the generals and their ladies and perhaps the original text was not
as strong as we recall. The exception remains Christmas Eve when the Tommies
hear the Jerries singing 'Heilige Nacht' from across the trenches: they
talk, fraternise, play football in no-man's land before the shelling
resumes. This is as moving as ever.
Direction is by Dean Byfield and the show is sponsored by Price Waterhouse.
It runs at the Bloomsbury Theatre, London WC1 (071-388-8822) until September
10.

microscope
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW DERRINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scientists working at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have
discovered how two tumour-suppressor genes, called Rb and p53, co-operate to
prevent cancer in mice, writes Andrew Derrington.
Their results, described in this week's issue of the journal Nature, throw
light on the way the body controls the destruction of irreparably damaged
cells. The Rb protein acts during the development of the eye in the embryo.
It stops cells from dividing and causes them to differentiate into their
adult forms. If it is absent, the product of the p53 gene prevents the cells
from proliferating by inducing programmed cell death.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Improved method to weld copper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Copper's ability to resist corrosion has made it one of the front-runners in
the search to find a suitable material in which to store nuclear waste under
ground. The snag is that copper is difficult to weld because of its high
thermal conductivity.
The Welding Institute, a Cambridge-based research group which is working on
a prototype copper canister for the Swedish Nuclear Fuel &amp; Waste Management
Company, believes the solution lies with the use of reduced pressure
electron beam welding. It uses a 100kW electron beam, which is sufficiently
intense to penetrate the 50mm-thick copper canister. The steel-lined
canisters produced by this process are expected to last more than 100,000
years.

Few arid countries can justify the cost of using water purified through
conventional desalination techniques for agriculture. Light Works, a
London-based company sponsored by the EC, has addressed this problem by
developing what it believes is a cost-effective system for producing crops
and pure water in hot coastal regions.
Its prototype greenhouse, which has been built on Tenerife, uses surplus
heat to evaporate sea water, which is purified by being passed through a
heat exchanger cooled by cold sea water. It yields sufficient surplus water
to water the crops within the greenhouse and irrigate the immediate
surrounding area.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Technology: Towards a cure for blindness
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Work on a protein that stimulates blood vessel formation may lead to a drug
to prevent blindness. The protein, vascular endothelial growth factor
controls the laying down of blood vessels during normal development.
VEGF may also cause abnormal blood vessel proliferation in diabetic
retinopathy, the commonest cause of blindness in the UK workforce. The
abnormal blood vessels prevent light reaching the sensitive part of the eye
and are fragile, often causing further damage by bleeding. The British
Diabetic Association estimates this type of blindness affects between 7,000
and 14,000 people in the UK annually. With early detection, laser treatment
is possible in 70 per cent of cases.
The hope of a drug treatment rests on three sets of results from researchers
in Israel, Australia and the US. The Israeli team first identified VEGF and
developed sensitive tests for it while working on ways of preventing the
blood vessel formation (and hence growth) in human tumours.
They then showed, in collaboration with Jonathan Stone of Sydney University,
that VEGF is the protein that regulates the formation of blood vessels in
the developing rat retina.
The third piece of the jigsaw is that high levels of VEGF are found in the
eyes of patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy.
The next step is to develop a drug that inhibits the production of VEGF, and
to test if it prevents the unwanted proliferation of blood vessels in the
retina.
According to Stone: 'Much is known about the gene and the protein and the
possibility of specific inhibitors is real.'

FT  02 SEP 94 / Technology: A vision for the future - Advances in surgery
mean many eye problems are now treatable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW DERRINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The idea of surgeons manipulating the shape of the eye to correct faulty
vision would have been unthinkable to most people a few years ago. But today
 -with the help of laser incisions, special materials and new techniques -
defective eyesight can be improved with a surgical precision that only the
latest technology can provide.
For many, this means a visit to the optician for a new pair of spectacles or
contact lenses will no longer be necessary, or not so often. Surgeons can
break up the lenses of patients with poor vision and replace them with
artificial ones. The profile of the cornea can be altered and tests are
being carried out on injectable lenses made of gels.
One of the most common eye defects, especially in old people, is the
cataract in which the lens becomes clouded. It is more common in old people
and affects 80 per cent of over 80s in the UK, according to Arthur Steele, a
surgeon at Moorfields Eye Hospital. The causes are unknown, but exposure to
ultraviolet light and poor diet may be important.
To restore the vision of an eye with a cataract, the cloudy lens must be
removed and may be replaced by a plastic implant. But early implants caused
problems. The Perspex (PMMA) lenses were large and heavy. A long incision,
weakening the eye and changing its shape as it heals, is needed to insert
them and their weight makes them tend to move around. Cells tend to stick to
the PMMA lenses, making the implant cloudy and the implant is rigid, so the
eye cannot accommodate (focus) on near objects.
Yet all these problems, except the lack of accommodation, have been solved
by advances in equipment and techniques. The first step towards reducing
incision size was to break the lens up before extracting it. The problem was
to hit the lens hard enough, without damaging anything else inside the eye.
In the technique known as phaco-emulsification, a vibrating ultrasonic probe
breaks the lens up and removes it by suction.
The latest instruments remove the lens through a 1.5mm incision. The
problem, however, is that the implant replacing the lens has to pass through
the incision and be big enough to sit snugly in the lens capsule holding it
in the correct position inside the eye. Extracting the old lens through a
pinhole is no use if the incision has to be enlarged to insert a big
implant.
The development of foldable lenses alleviates this problem. PMMA is rigid,
but small lenses can be made with folding extensions (haptics). After
insertion the haptics are unfolded to keep the lens in the centre of the
capsule. These lenses can be inserted through a 5mm incision.
Even more advanced are lenses that can 'remember' their unfolded shape, and
resume it after insertion. Made of newer plastics, such as silicone or
acrylic, they can be folded or rolled up and inserted through even smaller
incisions. Lens insertions through incisions as small as 1.5 mm have been
reported. But these techniques are experimental and need to be carefully
evaluated. One potential problem is that silicone lenses may unfold
violently and damage the eye.
New lens materials also have other advantages. Cells do not stick to them,
so the lenses stay cleaner. Acrylic lenses can be made very thin, because
the plastic has a high refractive index - it bends light sharply, allowing
implants of very high optical quality to be designed.
However, even the latest implants cannot change focus. In the normal eye,
the lens capsule is under tension and flattens the lens by squeezing it. The
eye focuses on near objects by relaxing the capsule, allowing the lens to
curve.
Researchers in several countries are searching for a substance that will
form a lens that fills the capsule, corrects the focus of the eye and is
elastic enough to permit accommodation, or close-up focusing.
Yet even without accommodation, vision with a rigid implant can be improved
by a new technique. The profile of the cornea is measured before surgery and
the size and shape of the surgical incision are then planned so that the eye
heals with a corneal profile giving a precisely calculated degree of
astigmatism (difference in focus for lines of different angles).
According to Julian Stevens, a London eye surgeon who uses a
computer-controlled laser to make the incisions, the desired astigmatism
leaves the cornea slightly more curved in the vertical direction than in the
horizontal direction. The subjective effect is that clear vision is obtained
except for the very closest work.
For patients with simpler vision problems surgeons can also modify the
profile of the cornea, avoiding the need for spectacles or contact lenses.
The profile must be made flatter to correct myopia (short sight) or more
curved to correct hypermetropia (long sight).
One such method is radial keratotomy, in which a star-shaped incision
flattens the cornea. The success of this technique is highly dependent on
the surgeon's skill.
A newer, and rapidly evolving, technique - entirely driven by technological
changes, many derived from military applications - is photorefractive
keratectomy (PRK). A computer-controlled laser etches tissue from the
corneal surface to change its shape. PRK is an area of extremely rapid
development. Companies in the US, Europe, Japan and Russia are developing
more flexible ways of controlling the lasers so that problems requiring
different patterns of tissue removal can be treated. The change in profile
is produced by varying the amount of tissue removed from different parts of
the surface.
Long-sightedness can now be treated using a moving laser beam. The first
results are available from a system which uses a moving slit, developed by
Aeschulap-Meditech of Germany.
To correct hypermetropia with a scanning laser beam, the beam intensity or
the number of pulses can be controlled to etch more tissue from the edge
than from the centre, thus steepening the corneal curvature. The approach
can be extended, modifying the shape, intensity and number of pulses to
produce any desired change in the corneal profile. Thus astigmatism and
irregularities in the corneal surface can be corrected.
With such rapid advances in eye technology, patients will one day find a
visit to the eye-surgeon as routine and beneficial as a trip to the high
street optician.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Management: Sharing the blame
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When a company performs badly, shareholders usually blame the chief
executive and other senior executives. The criticism is rarely directed
towards the board of directors.
Boards have been 'unique among institutions in their insulation from
performance review and enforceable mandates to change their procedures or
membership,' says a study* by the Conference Board, a business membership
organisation that researches business policy and practice.
Yet there are signs that this state of affairs is changing. The Conference
Board study reports 'a growing recognition' that boards have a
responsibility to review and improve the effectiveness of their operations.
There has been an increasing demand for director accountability following
poor company results and the publication of the Cadbury report in the UK,
which attempted to define standards for corporate governance.
Those companies which have introduced director appraisal systems tend to
stress the importance of contributions to discussions, says the report.
Other issues that tend to be highlighted include analytical ability,
assertiveness and skill at communicating.
But formal procedures to evaluate board performance are still rare.
The assessment of directors is handicapped because boards are 'a community
of peers' whose role has not traditionally involved criticising their
collective or individual effectiveness. As a result, devising an assessment
process that commands general respect is paramount. 'Because the exercise
lacks any compliance or enforcement authority, it derives its legitimacy
from the integrity of the process itself,' says the report.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Management: A question of motivation - How to keep up staff
morale amid job losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How do you manage a business whose 340 employees will mostly be made
redundant in two years' time? That is the challenge facing Keith Greenough,
chief executive of Mortgage Express, the TSB's centralised mortgage lending
subsidiary.
A casualty of the deep recession in the UK housing market, North
London-based Mortgage Express is winding down its 'book' ahead of the
transfer of its functions and remaining assets to TSB branches in 1996. At
that point, all but a few will lose their jobs.
Greenough acknowledges that the health of the business is heavily influenced
by macroeconomic factors - the six months to April, for example, saw a
turnround from losses of Pounds 15m to profits of Pounds 19m as the bad debt
charge tumbled - but he insists that the efforts of staff can make a
significant impact.
Employee involvement, training and better communication are on the Mortgage
Express agenda, at least as much as they would be at any enlightened
financial services company with a more secure future.
Morale was especially low when Greenough and his team arrived in 1991, amid
rumours that the company was likely to be sold and following a decision to
relocate the mortgage administration centre to Glasgow (subsequently
reversed). 'One of the first things we noticed was a lack of trust,'
explains Peter Taylor, director of human resources and quality.
An important part of the re-motivation strategy has been the development of
two-way communication channels. Particular emphasis was placed on
introducing a staff opinion survey that adequately reflected the needs of
the company. Other companies (including TSB, Rank Xerox and Federal Express)
were benchmarked and 'metaplanning', a technique involving different groups
of staff in confidential brainstorming sessions, was used. The fact that 78
per cent of employees responded to the subsequent questionnaire against a 60
per cent response rate to earlier polls conducted for the company by Mori,
is an indication that the planning paid off. There are now about half a
dozen cross-functional teams working on different issues, including finding
a fairer system of staff appraisal.
Overall 71 per cent of employees said they were positive or very positive
about the company, although 50 per cent do not or tend not to believe what
management says, and more than 60 per cent disagree or tend to disagree with
the statement that Mortgage Express management generally understands the
problems they face in their jobs.
Staff development is one means by which Greenough and his fellow executives
will be hoping to improve their rating this year.
Among the 36 employees being sponsored or part-sponsored for a professional
qualification at the moment is Susie Every, a litigation supervisor who
started as a temp in the collections department. Every has just completed an
MA in Human Resource Management, having written her dissertation on the
problems of downsizing at Mortgage Express. She is also developing a course
on CVs/job applications which she hopes to run for colleagues if a pilot
project proves successful.
More interesting work is another important source of motivation, say
Mortgage Express executives. Taylor points out, for example, that 32 people
have been moved to new positions in the company in the past year. 'As the
company gets smaller, the chance of someone moving into a
supervisory/management role is greater than it would otherwise be,' explains
Anne McDougall, manager in risk and management accounts.
Financial incentives, however, do not appear to loom large at Mortgage
Express.
According to Greenough: 'what you pay people is a potential demotivator if
you pay them a wage which is inconsistent with the market. This is a
possible source of dissatisfaction. Paying people more money is unlikely in
itself to create a higher level of performance. It is the way you treat
them.'

FT  02 SEP 94 / Management: Be a better builder - David Sainsbury reviews a
book expected to be this autumn's top business title in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID SAINSBURY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ideas of Gary Hamel and CK Prahalad are already well-known to regular
readers of this page. Harvard Business Review subscribers are also familiar
with them, from a series of brilliant articles, two of which, 'Strategic
Intent' and 'The Core Competence of the Corporation', have won the annual
McKinsey award for the review's best article.
Now they have used the material in those articles as the basis of an
exciting and valuable book on how companies build up leadership positions in
new industries.
It is a book they are well-equipped to write: Hamel is professor of
strategic and international management at the London Business School and
Prahalad is professor of business administration at the University of
Michigan. They are experienced consultants, and the book draws heavily on
the work they have done for companies such as Motorola, EDS, Philips and
Whirlpool.
Competing for the Future* is a book about corporate strategy, but it is not
a book about corporate strategy as it is taught in most business schools and
practised in most companies. The authors are not concerned with how to
position the firm optimally within an existing industry structure, but with
how companies create new industries.
They see this process as having three distinct but overlapping stages. The
first of these is competition for industry foresight and intellectual
leadership. This is competition to gain a deeper understanding of
technological, demographic, regulatory or lifestyle trends and
discontinuities that may transform industry boundaries and create new
industries.
Second, there is the race to accumulate the necessary core competencies, to
overcome technical hurdles, to attract coalition partners, to construct the
necessary product or service delivery infrastructure and to get agreement
around standards if necessary.
The third stage is competition for market position and market share. A big
advantage accrues to the company that is the first to penetrate global
markets, and the way to get there quicker is 'expeditionary marketing'.
Market research provides a valuable way for refining existing product
concepts, but it is not very helpful where new products are concerned. The
way to learn faster than competitors is, therefore, to develop an effective
system of product iteration.
This whole process of building a leadership position can take 15-20 years.
For example, JVC, a subsidiary of Matsushita and the world leader in VCRs,
began developing videotape competencies in the late 1950s and early 1960s,
after Ampex, a US company, had produced the first videotape recorder in
1959. But it was not until the late 1970s, nearly 20 years later, that JVC
had a winning product with its VHS-standard machine.
In this process of building up a leadership position the authors assign a
key role to the acquisition and deployment of core competencies. They define
a core competence as a bundle of distinct and defensible skills and
technologies that enables a company to provide a particular benefit to
customers. At Sony, for example, the benefit is 'pocketability' and the core
competence is miniaturisation. The possession of these competencies enables
companies to move into new product areas. Also, because they represent
cumulative learning rather than great leaps of inventiveness, it is
difficult for competitors to 'time compress' competence building and catch
up.
The authors also attach a great deal of weight to the motivation and
ambitions of companies, and they argue that starting resource positions are
a poor predictor of future industry leadership. While a traditional view of
strategy focuses on the 'fit' between existing resources and emerging
opportunities, the companies which build up leadership positions are those
that have a 'strategic intent' that creates, by design, a substantial
'misfit' between resources and aspirations. Strategy is about stretch as
well as about fit.
When British Airways proclaimed just after its privatisation in early 1987
that it wanted to become 'the world's favourite airline' many people would
have said this was not a realistic ambition. But by 1992, Business Traveller
magazine was rating BA as the best transatlantic airline, and number two
worldwide only to Singapore Airlines.
This book is a useful antidote to much current management thinking. As the
authors say, it is a book for those who are 'more inclined to build than
cut'. They believe that the US and Britain have produced an entire
generation of managers concerned only with downsizing, delayering and
divesting, and that the time has come to put more emphasis on creating the
markets of the future. Otherwise managers will find themselves on a
treadmill trying to keep one step ahead of the steadily declining margins
and profits of yesterday's businesses.
The ideas put forward in this book are stimulating and original and many of
them are already being used by successful companies. But they need to be
handled carefully by businessmen and women seeking to apply them.
While companies should be ambitious, the book at times become too
inspirational. If one's 'strategic intent' is strong enough and one is
imaginative enough, then there is apparently nothing to stop one becoming
the leader of one's industry. Any small business can become a Honda or a
Sony. But for many companies more modest ambitions may be more appropriate.
They may be limited by the talent and skills of their management team.
Second, while the authors have sought to show how their ideas can apply to
all industries, they are undoubtedly at their best when discussing
world-class electronics and IT companies, where most of their consulting has
been done. I have no doubt that their ideas can be applied more widely, but
they will need to be modified. The chief executive of a medium-sized
engineering company will find a lot here that is useful and interesting, but
he will need to adapt the concepts carefully to the circumstances of his own
company and industry.
I predict that this book will be a big success, and that many businessmen
will gain competitive advantage from reading it. It provides a more coherent
view of strategy than Kenichi Ohmae's The Mind of the Strategist, is more
original and stimulating than In Search of Excellence, and is certainly more
enjoyable to read than Michael Porter's volumes on Competitive Strategy and
Competitive Advantage.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Property: Returns fall
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Retail and industrial property rates of return fell in July with total
all-property returns declining by 0.2 percentage points to 0.7 per cent for
the month, according to Investment Property Databank, a research group.
Capital values managed only a marginal increase over the month while total
rental values fell by 0.2 per cent.
This was disappointing following the recent stabilization in rental values.
However, the long-term slide in rental values has slowed.
Rental values of all types of property during the 12 months to end-July have
fallen by 3.5 per cent says IPD.
The year-on-year total return on all properties fell from 26.1 per cent to
25.4 per cent between June and July. Retail remained the best performing
sector with total returns of 0.9 per cent in spite of a half-point fall in
July.
Industrials were in second place with a return of 0.7 per cent down from 1
per cent in June.
Offices, in spite of improving from 0.3 per cent to 0.4 per cent, remained
in third place in terms of total returns.
IPD said that net investment was the only indicator which remained buoyant
having been positive across all three sectors for nearly a year and rising
to Pounds 94m in July, close to the peak levels achieved in February and May
this year.

FT  02 SEP 94 / People: Powell Duffryn organises its top management
succession
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The top management succession at Powell Duffryn, one of the few British
companies to defeat an unwelcome takeover bid from Hanson, seems to have
been sorted out with the appointment of Barry Hartiss, 44, as deputy group
chief executive.
Hartiss, who joined the group following the 1985 acquisition of UK Petroleum
Products, has been responsible for rationalising the group's low margin fuel
distribution business.
He has been heavily involved in Powell Duffryn's move into port operations.
The firm is a major shareholder in Tees and Hartlepool port and is bidding
for British Coal's South Wales operations.
Hartiss was one of two internal candidates who appeared to be in the running
to take over from Andrew Roberts, 59, who retires as chief executive next
July.
Last September, Michael Noakes, 48, an ex-BTR executive and former chief
executive of Boustead, joined the board and there had been speculation that
he was being groomed for the top job. However, Noakes will take charge of
the group's principal engineering subsidiaries when Freddie Bircher, 62,
retires later this year.
The intention is that Hartiss will succeed Andrews who, along with Powell
Duffryn's chairman David Hubbard has been responsible for refocusing the
group after the unwelcome bid from Hanson.
Hubbard, a year younger than Andrews, is expected to stay on as chairman
until 1997, eventually handing over to VSEL's chief executive Noel Davies,
60, who has been appointed deputy chairman.
The appointment of Davies, who comes from an engineering background, is
designed to balance the promotion of Hartiss, who has come up through the
fuel distribution side.

FT  02 SEP 94 / People: Whiddett joins Threadneedle Investment Management
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Paul Manduca, who has been running Threadneedle Investment Management since
the end of May, has brought in a smaller companies specialist from Hill
Samuel Investment Management to improve the performance of a sector which he
has identified as in need of attention.
John Whiddett, 44, has spent the last decade at Hill Samuel, latterly
managing equity portfolios for UK life companies. He had been keen to return
to smaller companies.
In the early 1980s, Manduca also had a spell at the merchant bank,
specialising in smaller companies. Whiddett knows Threadneedle's investment
director in charge of UK equities - Howard Maguire - even better, as Maguire
had moved from an equivalent position at Hill Samuel just three years ago.
Threadneedle has around Pounds 30bn under management, comprising the funds
of both Allied Dunbar and Eagle Star insurance companies. Whiddett
acknowledged that he was 'slightly apprehensive' as to how the newly formed
Threadneedle - attempting to blend two such different cultures - would work
out, but added he had 'great confidence' in Manduca.
Manduca says inadequate expertise on the smaller companies side meant that
neither Allied Dunbar or Eagle Star had captured the 'big recovery bounce'
in the sector last year. He hopes Whiddett's arrival will increase the funds
allocated to this sector to Pounds 500m or more.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
George Simpson, chief executive of Lucas Industries since April, has seized
the reins at the Midlands-based automotive and aerospace components group.
The former Rover chairman has abolished Lucas's previous group executive
structure. Six business managing directors will now report directly to
Simpson, below, as will the four executives in charge of finance, human
resources, communications and strategic planning.
Jack Fryer takes the new position of director of strategic planning. Fryer,
55, was formerly managing director of Lucas Automotive, responsible for
power train systems. He joined Lucas in 1986 from Rank Xerox.
A Frenchman, Jean-Francois Cayot, 56, succeeds Fryer as managing director of
Lucas Diesel Systems. He joined Lucas in 1985 and is currently responsible
for the group's car and commercial vehicle diesel operations, based in
Blois, France.
Frank Turner remains managing director of Lucas Aerospace. Ken Maciver,
managing director of Braking Systems, will concentrate on developing Lucas's
braking interests. John Anthony assumes sole responsibility for Lucas
Aftermarket Operations. John Plant, Lucas Electrical Systems, now reports
directly to Simpson. John Parnaby becomes managing director of Lucas
Electronic Systems Products, responsible for the remaining applied
technology businesses.

FT  02 SEP 94 / People: Cook follows Gray's footsteps
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JP Morgan has found someone to fill the shoes vacated by Robert Gray, one of
the best-known figures in the international capital markets business, who
left the firm in April to go to HSBC Holdings.
Gray's old responsibilities as joint head of European capital markets will
be taken on by another Englishman, Joseph Cook, who returns to London after
a six-year stint at Morgan's New York office.
Cook went to the Big Apple in 1988, the year Morgan got permission to
underwrite US domestic bonds, to set up the US syndicate desk. He then ran
the North American capital markets operation.
Cook is no stranger to the London eurobond scene. Before joining Morgan in
1985, he was part of the so-called 'Orion mafia', having spent 14 years at
Orion Royal Bank, then a key player in the eurobond market. He should also
be familiar with Gray's shoes; he stepped into a previous pair nine years
ago, when he took over from Gray as head of Morgan's fixed-income syndicate
desk.

FT  02 SEP 94 / People: Amec
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Amec, the engineering and construction group which has been struggling to
recover from the recession, has replaced Dennis Clark, 46, head of its
process and energy business, which accounts for about a third of Amec's
Pounds 2.1bn turnover.
Clark is an oil and gas man who took over as managing director of Press, the
offshore engineering operation, after most of its top management team
defected to a rival firm ten years ago. He joined the Amec board in May 1990
and has been responsible for running one of the more resilient parts of
Amec's business.
Clark's departure has surprised some analysts. Amec, which publishes its
interim figures next week, stressed that there was nothing ominous about his
exit. Sources close to the company said it derived from differences in
management style rather than poor financial performance. It is understood
that Amec feels that it has not been as successful in the international
market as it should have been. Ex-Wimpey executive George Payne, 46, who has
been Amec's commercial director since 1993, has taken over as chairman of
Amec's process and energy sector.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Property: Deceptive appearances - A look at apparent
anomalies in Hong Kong's market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hong Kong's property market would appear to be full of anomalies. In the
past three years, strong demand from multinationals, eager to secure a
footing in the British colony as a bridgehead to the lucrative China market,
has sent property prices spiralling 200 per cent.
Yet only last month property developers watched with incredulity as a plot
of land was withdrawn from government auction after it failed to attract
bids. Two other sites were snapped up at the opening bids, creating the
quietest auction many Hong Kong analysts could recall. The last time the
government withdrew a plot was in 1984.
At the same time, some 10 floors of the Lippo Centre, a gleaming twin tower
block formerly owned by Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond, are lying empty,
says property consultants Brooke Hillier Parker. In the six months to
end-August rents for central office space rose 18.8 per cent to an average
HKDollars 93.40 per square foot.
In any other market these examples would reasonably be interpreted as signs
of an ailing market. But not, it seems, in Hong Kong. The empty offices in
the Lippo Building present a welcome dilemma for the owners (a mix of local
Hong Kong Chinese and mainland Chinese): whether to lease at yields of 10
per cent, or to sell for a book profit of at least HKDollars 5,000 a sq ft.
The offices would sell for between HKDollars 13,000 and HKDollars 18,000 per
sq ft.
The disappointing auction, which saw Citic Pacific, a Beijing-controlled
diversified conglomerate, walk off with two bargain sites after making the
only bids of the day, may primarily have been a reflection of developers'
anger over an Independent Commission Against Corruption investigation into
alleged corrupt practices at an auction on May 26; poorer quality sites and
a mood of caution also contributed to the disappointing response.
Mr Peter Churchouse, managing director of Morgan Stanley Asia, said: 'I am
fairly convinced this (the auction) is not reflective of the property market
in Hong Kong, or of where the market is heading.
'That auction was not about the property market. It was about the bad blood
between the developers and the government. Citic got a steal. This is about
making points. It's about power.'
His assertion - denied by developers, who instead grumbled that the opening
bids had been set too high - stems also from the tension between developers
and the government since March, when Mr Chris Patten, governor, announced
his intention to cool the overheating property market.
Since then, according to the government, property prices have fallen by
10-30 per cent. The slump was sufficient to prompt the government - just two
days after the previous month's embarrassing auction - to call a halt on any
further talk of intervention in the market.
The price fall, says the government, was the result of measures announced in
June, in particular the clampdown on the re-sale of pre-sale flats before
completion. At the same time local interest rates rose in response to a hike
in US levels while banks tightened mortgage lending restrictions.
The Hong Kong market, say analysts, defies the conventional definition of a
market. Indeed Mr Archie Hart, head of research at broker Crosby Securities,
says the colony's market does not strictly deserve the name of market, as
demand is artificially constrained by the banks, which cap loans, and supply
is limited by the government, which sells off limited parcels throughout the
year.
'At the moment it looks like this situation will continue. There is no
avalanche of new supply coming on stream and equally the banks are saying
the 70 per cent (loan to value) limit (for mortgages) could become a way of
life rather than a temporary thing.'
Government intervention could, too, remain a feature of the market in the
short-term, as indicated by the ICAC investigation into the ways auctions
are conducted - a probe prompted by the controversial May 26 auction.
The taskforce carrying out the review recently returned from a fact-finding
mission to Singapore, from where the idea of a tender system is likely to be
imported. Under this system, where developers are obliged to provide
infras-tructure - road links or sewage - they would tender rather than bid
at auction for land plots.
While the mood of caution provoked by the June measures is likely to
continue, anecdotal evidence suggests activity is returning to the market.
The number of new loans approved but not yet taken up increased in July,
while residential property transactions rose by between 10 per cent and 15
per cent last month. This evidence of activity suggests the recent low
prices achieved at auctions were aberrations - or political posturing -
rather than the signal for a toppling market.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Northern Ireland: Siege mentality takes a grip on the
Protestants - Loyalist view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hoarding of goods had begun on the Shankill Road yesterday. Shops said that
candles, gas lighters and basic foods were in demand all day as many
Protestants made provision for a breakdown in law and order.
'The siege mentality is taking hold down here,' one shopkeeper said. 'I'm
calling it the peace dividend.'
Fear was evident yesterday in the Shankill Road and other working-class
unionist strongholds - fear that the IRA ceasefire followed concessions made
by the British government and fear that the IRA will not hand over its guns,
enabling the violence to continue.
The talk along the Shankill yesterday was of a civil war in Ulster being
'the obvious outcome' if the British government has traded in the unionist
veto for the IRA ceasefire.
'People have reacted very badly,' said Mr Bob Stoker, an Ulster Unionist
party activist who lives near Sandy Row, another Protestant area.
'They have not taken it calmly at all. There has been a great run on food
stores and people have sold out of gas cookers, candles and paraffin lamps,'
he said.
'People are prepared to wait and see for a short while but while they do so
they are getting prepared,' Mr Stoker said. 'Ordinary people down here will
not be put in a situation where they can be starved into defeat.'
Tension in Protestant areas of inner-city Belfast was heightened following a
raid by the Royal Ulster Constabulary on two houses last night. According to
the Rev Eric Smyth, a councillor for the hardline Democratic Unionist party,
the police smashed down the door of one house in spite of it being empty.
'Tempers are very high at the moment,' he said. 'The feeling is very bad.'
Mr Smyth said concerns developed after part of yesterday's Sinn Fein
celebration procession involving more than 50 cars, taunted and threw sticks
at children playing in a Protestant area near to the Catholic Falls Road.
Suspicion is also rife. The Rev Brian Moore, minister at the West Kirk
Presbyterian church on the Shankill Road, talked of disaster if concessions
had been made by the British government.
'If that does emerge then that's another ball game altogether,' he said.
'That would be a very serious situation which we would find very difficult
to control.'
'We have longed for peace. But I suppose there is a suspicion in the
community that there may be a hidden agenda with the government and the IRA,
that a deal has been done.' Mr Moore said there was 'disillusionment with
our political representatives,' but 'hopes loyalist paramilitaries will
assist the peace process'.
Mr David Ervine, a leading member of the Progressive Unionist party, which
is thought to have insight into the UVF, the loyalist para-military
organisation, thinks the ceasefire will aid the peace process - but only
when it is clear no deal has been done.
'If the government can assuage the fears of unionists I would expect an
immediate response,' he said. He believes this would involve a ceasefire
announcement by the main loyalist terrorist groups. 'If assurances are given
the loyalist weapons will be laid down, and laid down quickly,' Mr Ervine
said.
Other unionists were willing to look on the bright side. Mr Michael
McGimpsey, an Ulster Unionist party councillor in Belfast, believed
assurances from the British government that no deals had been done.
Mr McGimpsey believed that the 'cul de sac' argument may be the real reason
the IRA called a ceasefire. 'They may finally have realised that their
tactics were not getting them anywhere,' he said.
But he also warned: 'If people believe the IRA have stopped because they
have got something then we are in for a very difficult time.'

FT  02 SEP 94 / Northern Ireland: Business hopes for up to 30,000 jobs -
Economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The IRA ceasefire has injected a mood of cautious optimism into Northern
Ireland's business community, but has also triggered warnings that economic
support to the province must be maintained to underpin the hoped-for peace.
Business leaders and economists in Belfast estimate that a lasting peace
could bring between 15,000 and 30,000 new jobs to the province over the next
five years, but this would be partially offset by job losses in
security-related employment.
One other benefit from a peace settlement, mentioned by a number of business
executives yesterday, would be that companies would find it easier to
attract senior managers to the province.
Mr Nigel Smyth, the director of the Confederation of British Industry
(Northern Ireland), said if the ceasefire proved to be permanent, 'there
will be a lot of business opportunities in the medium and long term'.
He thought job growth through inward investment would quadruple, from about
500 per year to 2,000 over a two-to-three-year period, while an additional
10,000 jobs could be created in the tourist industry.
'On a per capita basis, tourist numbers here are presently a third of those
in the republic and a quarter of those in Scotland,' he said.
Mr Michael Smyth, an economist at the University of Ulster at Jordanstown,
said the CBI figures erred on the conservative side. Tourism contributes 1.5
per cent to GDP in the province, compared with 7 per cent in the republic,
so catching up with the south could create 20,000-30,000 tourism jobs in
Northern Ireland. Unemployment is currently 98,000 - 13.1 per cent of the
workforce.
Stena Sealink, one of the main ferry operators across the Irish Sea, said
interest in Ireland as a holiday destination 'is weighted very much towards
the south because of the troubles in the north. Clearly, a permanent end to
the violence would do no end of good.'
The CBI said a climate of peace would allow manufacturing and service
companies to focus their marketing on quality production. Mr Nigel Smyth
said Northern Ireland businesses had one of the best records in Europe for
quality awards, but that had been overshadowed by the province's image
problem.
The downside of the peace will be the inevitable cuts in the security forces
and security-related industries. Reductions in policing levels and the
prison population, and eased security in shops, offices and factories will
mean less overtime, job losses, and less money going into the economy - the
loss could be as much as Pounds 300m to Pounds 400m per year.
The more pessimistic forecasts envisage job losses in the region of 20,000,
a figure calculated by Dr Graham Gudgin of the Northern Ireland Economic
Research Council. He said that over four to five years the province's
economy 'will be lucky to break even on jobs'. Mr Smyth of UUJ said the
number of job losses was more likely to be around 10,000 to 12,000, but he
admitted there could be further indirect losses.
Mr Michael Smyth said the transition to a peacetime economy would have to be
managed very carefully. The government would be 'extremely foolish if it
were to send any savings it made through an end to the violence straight
back to the Treasury.'
The CBI said any security-related savings and exchequer benefits achieved
through economic growth 'should be redirected towards wealth creation and
training'.
The Department of Economic Development in Belfast acknowledged that there
was a danger of short-term job losses. 'But any change will not be a jolt
but gradual, and will be balanced by new jobs over a period. The economic
development budget is very substantial at Pounds 400m and is expected to
remain that way.'
It said the Treasury would decide whether additional resources through
savings on security could be redirected towards development.
There may also be help from other sources. Last night Sir Leon Brittan, the
European commissioner, said the European Union was ready to consider
increasing the aid and assistance it gives to Northern Ireland.
Mr Clem Parkes, chief executive of CV Carpets which is based in the
north-east of the province, said: 'It is always difficult to get managers
and specialists that we cannot find here to relocate from Britain. That will
become much easier. And our experience is that when we do get them here they
don't want to leave.'

FT  02 SEP 94 / Northern Ireland: Peace is still not guaranteed -
Paramilitaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Renewed threats of civil war made by Ulster's loyalist paramilitaries
provide a grim reminder that an end to violence by the IRA gives no
guarantee of peace in the province. The gunning-down of a Catholic in
Belfast last night served to drive home that message.
Though the loyalists say they also want an end to 25 years of bloodshed,
they believe that almost any deal on Ulster's future acceptable to
republicans must undermine unionist interests.
Those interests, they warn, will be defended with a determination and
military skill equal to anything shown by the IRA over the past 25 years.
Those claims may be exaggerated, but their ultimate potential to wage war
will depend on the extent of support from a loyalist community feeling
increasingly cornered.
The fear, particularly in working-class areas, is that unionists - whatever
the assurances of Westminster - are close to being sold out.
The logic, in the minds of the loyalist paramilitaries, is that the IRA,
with minimal support, has pushed its cause to the top of the political
agenda using violence; if the strategy has worked for them then, the
argument goes, it will work to protect the majority loyal to the Union.
Ministers and politicians on all sides will have to work hard to set minds
at rest and convince the unionist community that, if the IRA reaches the
negotiating table, it will do so on the basis of the Downing Street
declaration alone and any agreement will fully safeguard the Union's future.
Most unionists have no more time for the loyalist gunmen than they have for
the IRA but that could change if, in the weeks ahead, the sands appear to be
shifting under Ulster's position in the UK.
Unionist politicians will play a critical role in determining the level of
support a nervous community might offer extremists. None of them condone
violence but in recent months there have been some attempts to rationalise
paramilitaries' actions in the face of the 'republican threat'.
Loyalist extremists believe they are well-placed to exploit new
uncertainties and old anxieties, and say they are able to launch a
counter-offensive which will render unworkable any political accommodation
with the republicans.
With loyalist action against the IRA and Sinn Fein cited as a reason behind
the switch in republican strategy, renewed attempts to draw the IRA back
into armed conflict can be expected.
The illegal Ulster Defence Association, the largest loyalist paramilitary
organisation, which mounts attacks in the name of the Ulster Freedom
Fighters, has traditionally portrayed itself as intent upon reacting only to
IRA atrocities.
But since the start of this year, the UDA claims it has tried to preserve
the Union. Failing that, the organisation - which said it would ignore the
ceasefire - wants to create an independent Northern Ireland.
After the three-day IRA ceasefire earlier this year, the UDA warned it could
extend activities to the Irish republic unless constitutional claims to the
north were dropped.
But for some years the UDA has not attracted the same levels of support it
enjoyed in the early 1970s. In 1974 it helped organise the workers' strike
that ended power-sharing in the province; that sort of influence and
authority has gone.
The Ulster Volunteer Force, also proscribed, has been responsible for some
vicious sectarian murders. 'The trouble is they just like killing
Catholics,' says one senior security officer.
The actions of loyalists have shown they have little to learn from the IRA.
This year, they have been responsible for a murder-rate almost double that
of the IRA.
The Catholic community is regarded as a legitimate target and the murderous
campaign is designed not only to spread fear, but to demonstrate the
loyalist capacity - in organisation and weaponry - to kill.
Security services do not underestimate that threat but say loyalist
extremists are not generally as well-armed as the IRA, are more loosely
organised and are more prone to infiltration. If the IRA remains dormant,
the Royal Ulster Constabulary hopes to direct more resources to the
loyalists.
The recognised danger is that politicians, in a search to embrace old
enemies, could supply fresh ammunition to loyalist extremists.
As one Ulster politician recently remarked, it is no longer impossible to
envisage them taking up arms against the very state to which they express
unswerving allegiance.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Northern Ireland: Sinn Fein voice ban may soon be lifted -
Media curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There were growing signs at Westminster yesterday that the government could
sanction an early lifting of the broadcasting ban on the voices of Sinn Fein
representatives if it was convinced the IRA had ended violence for good.
As both leading opposition parties said they would welcome the lifting of
restrictions, Mr Michael Mates, a former Northern Ireland minister,
indicated that he too thought an ending of the ban would be helpful.
Mr Mates, Tory MP for Hampshire East, said he thought the move would be
'high on the list' after the announcement of a permanent cessation of IRA
violence.
The only reason the voices of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, were
banned from the airwaves was because they supported violence, Mr Mates said.
'If there is no violence, that stricture goes away.' Removing the ban was 'a
relatively simple thing the government could do relatively soon - but I
think we will want one or two signs yet.'
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, is one of a number of
cabinet ministers known to favour an end to the ban on the grounds that it
has become counterproductive and tends to expose the government to
criticism.
But there are fears that such a move, if not handled sensitively, could
provoke anger among unionists and unionist sympathisers on the Tory back
benches.
One prominent unionist supporter said yesterday that he did not think
lifting the ban would provoke a strong reaction under the circumstances now
prevailing. But Mr David Trimble, the Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann,
indicated that he did not think the time for lifting the ban had yet
arrived.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Northern Ireland: Bomb targets warned not to drop their
guard - Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Insurers, hit by heavy claims from the IRA's mainland bombing campaign,
yesterday welcomed this week's ceasefire but insisted that new arrangements
for terrorism insurance and security precautions should remain in place.
Insurers have been hardest hit by the two IRA bombs in the City. Claims from
the Baltic exchange bomb in April 1992 amounted to Pounds 300m, including
about Pounds 100m for interruption to business. Claims from the Bishopsgate
bomb, a year later, totalled Pounds 500m, with about Pounds 150m for
business interruption.
Losses from other smaller bombs amount to less than Pounds 10m, said Mr Tony
Baker, deputy director-general of the Association of British Insurers.
In Northern Ireland the government has paid more than Pounds 620m since the
late 1960s to compensate property owners for damage. Losses rose to Pounds
50m in 1976-77 before falling steadily to Pounds 15m in 1986-87, but the
bill in 1991-92 was Pounds 33m.
After the London bombs, insurers withdrew cover for terrorism from standard
commercial policies. It is offered as a separate policy, with insurance
companies covering their own exposures through Pool Re, a company owned by
the insurance industry and backed by the government.
The decision by Pool Re to charge more to businesses in central London and
other areas judged to be terrorist targets than those in less vulnerable
areas caused considerable controversy.
Mr Baker said these problems had been overcome by insurers reducing some
expensive premiums in return for the installation or adoption of security
precautions. Mr Baker said changes were not likely for at least a year.
Mr Baker argued for the maintenance of security, such as the restrictions of
traffic in the City, and said there had to be a degree of caution.

Consultations on whether clergy should become subject to conventional

At present more than two-thirds of the Church's stipendiary clergy are in
post on the basis of the ecclesiastical freehold, meaning they cannot be
moved against their will. A steering group on conditions of service decided
this week to consult dioceses on seven possible alternative arrangements.
The church's policy-making General Synod will debate the issue next year.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Church panel appoints surveyor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Church Commissioners, the body which administers pensions and pay for
the Church of England clergy and its dependents, has appointed a
professional chief surveyor to manage its Pounds 1.2bn portfolio.
It is understood that Mr Andrew Brown, a partner at London chartered
surveyors St Quintin, was selected last month and will take up the post in
October.
Neither Mr Brown nor the Church Commissioners, which serves as a cross
between a pension fund and a private investment trust, would confirm the
appointment.
The appointment will fulfil a recommendation in the Lambeth Report, which
was commissioned in 1992 by the archbishop of Canterbury to look into the
Church's financial affairs. This followed a series of decisions to expand
its property holdings in the 1980s which led to an Pounds 800m loss.
The report advised the commissioners to hire a professional for the job,
formerly held by a commercial property manager with no professional
qualifications.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Women 'lose out' in heart treatment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Women heart attack sufferers are receiving inferior treatment and are less
likely to survive than men, research suggests today.
Two papers published in this week's British Medical Journal show they may
not be getting the best possible drugs, unlike their male counterparts.
A study of more than 800 patients admitted to a coronary care unit at a
London hospital found women were twice as likely to die in the first six
months as men were. One-in-three women died compared with one-in-six men.
Although the women tended to be older, researchers said this only partly
accounted for their increased risk, which was higher in the first 30 days
after an attack. Women were found to be less likely to be treated with
protective drugs when discharged from hospital and less likely to receive
drugs to counter clotting.
In a second study researchers from University Hospital, Nottingham, found
that elderly women are less likely to receive the best possible treatment
after a heart attack than men of the same age.
The elderly women in the survey - based on an examination of 7,850 patients
 -received fewer drugs to deal with clotting when admitted and fewer
preventative drugs when discharged than the men.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Vauxhall to close Luton upholstery unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US, plans to close a
component operation at its car assembly plant at Luton, Bedfordshire.
It said that the unit's 300-strong workforce would have had to accept a 50
per cent cut in wages to make it competitive with outside suppliers.
Vauxhall has warned trade unions that any industrial action over the closure
of the soft-trim unit could jeopardise its Pounds 12.5m plan to increase car
assembly capacity by 25 per cent at the Luton plant.
The company said there would be no compulsory redundancies among the workers
in the unit, which cuts and sews seat covers.
It said most European volume carmakers had already given up in-house 'cut
and sew' soft-trim operations because of the lower costs of specialist
producers.
The company plans to transfer most of the workforce to other production
areas. An early retirement or voluntary redundancy scheme will be offered to
a limited number.
About 90 per cent of workers in the seat-cover unit are women, who make up
only 15 per cent of the car assembly workforce at Luton.
The TGWU general union said employees in the soft-trim unit were to be
balloted about opposing the closure. A second ballot would be necessary
before industrial action could be taken.
Vauxhall said it planned to close the operation from July next year, when
production of the next generation Vauxhall Cavalier/Opel Vectra would start
at the Luton plant.
GM is investing about Pounds 130m to modernise and automate the plant in
preparation for the model change, and plans to increase capacity by about 25
per cent to 60 cars an hour by the end of next year from about 48.
Vauxhall has been the most profitable carmaker in the UK during the
recession and the Luton plant is GM's lowest-cost assembly facility in
Europe for production of the Vectra/Cavalier.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Tyne and Wear economy exceeds national growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manufacturing in Tyne and Wear outperformed both the UK and the northern
region on every main measure between 1989 and 1991, says a report. It adds
that the county's prospects in the mid-1990s, underpinned by a large and
growing motor industry, look good.
The report, by Tyne and Wear Research and Intelligence Unit, says output
rose 1 per cent in the two years compared with a 14 per cent UK fall.
Productivity rose 4 per cent to match UK levels for the first time since
1983, and manufacturing investment soared 46 per cent to Pounds 483m, 60 per
cent of which was accounted for by the motor industry.
Profit margins exceeded UK levels for the first time since 1979, and the
only two main indicators which fell - employment and profitability  -
recorded modest declines well below the northern region and UK levels, the
report says.
It says high investment, the closing of the productivity gap and improved
profitability all suggest a much better outlook for Tyne and Wear
manufacturing in the 1990s than the 1980s, although it predicts some decline
in manufacturing employment because of strong productivity growth.
The report, based on the Central Statistical Office census of production,
warns that some of the county's relatively strong 1991 performance might
have been due to the late impact of the recession on its industries.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Move to reorganise local councils under attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government pressure to standardise local authority services and limit
councils' autonomy to spend money raised locally is 'in conflict with local
democracy', the Joseph Rowntree Foundation warns in a report today.
The report says international comparisons suggest that local government in
France, Germany, Spain, Sweden and the US is more accountable than in the UK
and is viewed in more 'positive' terms.
It suggests that these countries are helped by a 'relatively stable
structure of local government' which is often based on an unchanging basic
unit, the municipality. This is a basic local tier of councils representing
very small populations.
These countries also distinguish between services where there is wide public
interest, and where the interest is local. In Germany regional authorities
control education while municipalities make decisions about refuse
collection.
The government's plans for local government reorganisation involve moving
further away from successful foreign models, causing further instability,
creating larger 'lowest tier' authorities, and combining more functions in
one council.
According to the foundation the 'lowest tier' in Great Britain are the
districts, with an average population of 110,000.
The Local Government Commission proposes to replace these in England with
new unitary authorities, combining the powers of districts and county
councils, with populations of between 150,000 and 250,000.
In France, the lowest tier 'commune' authorities have an average population
of 1,600. Municipalities in Germany, Spain and the US have average
populations of 7,500, 4,800 and 7,000 respectively.
According to the foundation autonomy is also helped by a wide local tax
base, but less than 20 per cent of all local revenues are retained locally
in Great Britain.
This compares with 43 per cent in France, 41 per cent in Germany, where
there is a local income tax, and 38 per cent in the US, which has local
property and sales taxes.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Investors invited to run Tube line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Private-sector rail companies have been invited to take over the six-mile
Epping to Ongar section of London Underground's Central Line following a
government decision to approve the ending of Tube services on it.
Mr John Watts, transport minister, yesterday gave approval for London
Underground to close the east London branch, which is losing Pounds 184,000
a year. He instructed the company not to sell or dismantle the track and
buildings for three years to allow another operator to acquire the assets.
The line, which carries a shuttle service during weekday rush-hours only, is
used by fewer than 80 passengers a day. London Underground said that at
least Pounds 4m would have to be spent on it if it were to remain open to
Tube services.
The company said yesterday that the only private-sector interest shown since
the closure was mooted had come from the Ongar Railway Preservation Society,
which had plans for a limited passenger service using steam engines.
The minister also approved the closure of Aldwych Underground station in
central London and the single-track link to nearby Holborn station.
The station provides a weekday rush-hour service only, used by 450 people a
day. The line loses Pounds 150,000 a year and would require investment of
more than Pounds 6m if kept open.
Mr Denis Tunnicliffe, managing director of London Underground, welcomed the
decisions, which will save Pounds 10.8m.

FT  02 SEP 94 / BT seeks to make the most of its lower prices: A look at the
tactics of telecoms companies as competition becomes keener
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not just British Telecommunications hype. The telephone really is
becoming steadily cheaper to use, particularly for business callers who
clock up long-distance and international minutes. And prices are set to fall
further as regulation and competition continue to bite.
This week's price cuts from BT mean that UK long-distance calls are barely a
third of the cost a decade ago, allowing for inflation. From the end of this
month a three-minute weekday morning call from London to Hereford will cost
30p. In January this year it was 50p.
Not all prices have come down. Line rental charges have risen 10 per cent in
real terms in the past decade, and will continue rising. Oftel, the telecoms
regulator, supports BT's efforts to reduce its deficit on maintaining basic
line connections. But it has forced the company to bring its call charges
down sharply, reflecting the falling cost of delivering calls as new
technology slashes overheads.
Oftel's price cap obliges BT to reduce its total charges by 7.5 per cent a
year, once an increase for inflation has been allowed for. In round figures
that equals price cuts worth Pounds 500m, with Pounds 100m recouped from a 2
per cent real-terms increase in line rental charges. BT is free to target
the cuts as it chooses.
Mr Michael Hepher, BT's managing director, says three factors determine its
price-cutting strategy. Ideally, cuts will stimulate usage. They ought to
give BT 'the most favourable stance against the competition' and they should
'do something to sparkle the imagination'.
The abolition of the morning peak rate earlier this year met the last two
criteria. This week's abolition of the higher long-distance rate, at a cost
of Pounds 244m over a full year, was firmly directed at the first and second
 -particularly at competition in the business market.
Mercury, BT's main competitor, has a quarter of the large business market
and about two-thirds of the City of London's outgoing traffic. But it is
increasingly hampered by BT's falling prices on one hand and by new entrants
pursuing its bigger customers on the other.
The price gap between BT and Mercury is steadily narrowing in the business
market (see graph). For many big businesses the saving is down to 6 per cent
or less for UK traffic.
Mr Terry Rhodes, Mercury's competition director, said his company had to
break out of the 'BT-but-cheaper' syndrome. He believes the message still
has strong appeal to small and medium-sized businesses - those with annual
telecoms bills of less than Pounds 150,000. But Mercury's efforts are
shifting to building 'brand loyalty' through added-value business services
such as network management and improved data telecoms links.
A host of new operators has moved into the City, the UK's telecoms honeypot,
and targetting Mercury first and foremost.
The most successful to date appears to be Worldcom, a US group which set up
in London in 1991. Worldcom re-sells international lines to big business at
a discount. It boasts 250 business customers and claims to have cornered
nearly 3 per cent of the UK's outgoing international telecoms traffic. Mr
David Hardwick, managing director, said: 'Our marketing is based on 10 per
cent to 15 per cent off Mercury's best business price.'
Worldcom is also about to enter the small and medium-size business market,
and plans to offer a long-distance UK service in addition to its
international service, inter-connecting to existing long-distance networks.
MFS, another US group, is already active in the UK long-distance business.
Launched in March this year, MFS offers free line rental to customers with
usage bills of Pounds 600 or more per line per year. Its fibre network
covers most of the City and Docklands and is being built out to Southwark
and Westminster. The company is considering a plan to extend the network to
the Thames Valley, putting MFS within reach of 35 per cent of the UK's big
telecoms users.
Long-distance telecoms capacity is abundant, giving plenty of scope for
re-sellers to expand. In addition to BT and Mercury, Energis, a subsidiary
of the National Grid which has erected a long-distance network on
electricity pylons, is opening for business. The regional electricity
companies covering Yorkshire and Manchester are building their own networks,
and targeting business users.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Fleet car buyers see discount cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The discounts businesses have been able to obtain on most company car
purchases have fallen sharply. This is mainly because of vehicle makers
cutting dealers' profit margins and other marketing changes prompted partly
by a taxation regime introduced in April.
The mean average discount reported by a broad sample of businesses
questioned in this year's annual Company Secretary's Review of company car
schemes fell to 9.6 per cent from 12.2 per cent last year and more than 14
per cent in 1992.
Even the 9.6 per cent figure overstates the discount most companies are
obtaining, because it includes deals made by some companies at much higher
discounts. The survey says: 'The vast majority of cars are now being
purchased with a reduction of 9 per cent or less.'
The survey, covering 400 companies operating a total of 38,000 cars,
identifies a small number of deals in which discounts of up to 41.3 per cent
were reportedly received. Most companies - none of which is identified -
reported achieving discounts of 9 per cent or less on the same models.
The survey acknowledges that some figures reflect deals agreed before
manufacturers cut their dealers' formal profit margins to 10 per cent or
less from a traditional 15 per cent to 16.5 per cent. 'However, it is
apparent that certain car manufacturers, keen to expand their presence in
the fleet market, often with new models, have been offering fleet buyers
very attractive deals,' it says.
The average discount figure appears to suggest that dealers are giving away
all their profit on a sale, or even making a loss. In virtually all cases,
however, manufacturers are providing them with other forms of compensation,
such as sales volume-related bonuses.
The reduced discounts also do not necessarily mean that companies are having
to pay more for their cars. In many cases official 'list' prices of cars
have been cut.
Low list prices are welcomed by the motor trade because of the new company
car tax regime, which links tax payable by employees directly to the list
price of cars, irrespective of any discounts obtained.
This year's survey also dispels the impression that 'prestige' carmakers
like to give that their products are above the general car market's discount
wars. It shows most companies achieving discounts of between 6 per cent and
9 per cent on some Mercedes and BMW models, for example.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Clergy may lose security of tenure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Consultations on whether clergy should become subject to conventional
employment contracts are to be conducted by the the Church of England.
At present more than two-thirds of the church's stipendiary clergy are in
post on the basis of the ecclesiastical freehold, meaning they cannot be
moved against their will. A steering group on conditions of service decided
this week to consult dioceses on seven possible alternative arrangements.
The church's policy-making general synod will debate the issue next year.
A report by the steering group finds that security of tenure in other
Christian denominations is 'considerably less' than that in most Church of
England clergy. It says the freehold enables clergy to voice their views
without fear or favour and protects them from arbitrary action by bishops,
fellow clergy, patrons or parishioners. But it impedes mobility and gives an
'unacceptable degree of permanence to the pastorally inadequate and
inefficient'.
Subjecting clergy to normal forms of employment contract are among the more
radical options raised by the report. Another option would replace the
freehold with a leasehold arrangement, under which incumbents would be
entitled to remain in post for a fixed number of years.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Names group turns on Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London has come under fire from a previously largely supportive
group of Names for allegedly overstating the assets the insurance market's
members need to continue underwriting.
The Association of Lloyd's Members says in its newsletter, published today,
that Lloyd's solvency rules 'appear to exaggerate solvency deficiencies and
minimise allowances for potential profits'.
Solvency rules govern the amount of capital which Names, the individuals
whose assets support Lloyd's, must deposit with the market.
The association says Lloyd's could be double-counting up to Pounds 2bn in
losses from claims on errors and omissions policies (which cover agents
against negligence awards) and catastrophe reinsurance, and suggests Names
are being asked for the money unnecessarily.
The newsletter says: 'These anomalies will prevent otherwise solvent Names
from continuing to underwrite . . . and alarm unnecessarily Names who have
ceased to trade. In part they represent fictitious losses which do not exist
and will never have to be paid.'
Mr David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman, yesterday rejected the claim, saying it
mis-stated the true position and held out false hopes to many members.
Separately, Lloyd's said it expected gross premium income to rise to Pounds
8.72bn in 1994 from Pounds 8.61bn last year, according to information in its
first quarterly business report.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Rise in house prices just tops inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The uncertain prospects for recovery in the UK housing market were
underlined yesterday with the publication of a survey showing the annual
rise in house prices at only just above the rate of inflation.
The monthly house price index published by Nationwide Building Society, the
UK's second largest society, suggested that house prices rose 0.6 per cent
in August, to a level 2.6 per cent higher than in August last year.
These figures are higher than those in the monthly survey produced by
Halifax Building Society, the UK's biggest mortgage lender.
The Halifax survey for August is due to be published today. It is expected
to confirm flatness in terms of month-on-month house price fluctuations, and
a small rise in prices over the year. In its July survey it said that
further monthly price falls were possible and estimated an annual rate of
increase of just 1 per cent.
Mr Brian Davis, Nationwide chief executive, said evidence suggested that the
recovery in market activity, which appeared to be strengthening early in the
year, was 'marginal', although underlying levels of transactions appeared to
have stabilised.
The society expects national house price rises to be close to the level of
inflation by the end of the year, but for this overall estimate to include
significant local variations.
Abbey National, the home loans and banking group, said that house prices
appeared to have steadied and were edging up slightly.
Mr Charles Toner, managing director of the group's retail operations, said:
'What we are seeing is that the mortgage market is probably a bit bigger
than last year. There is a lot of competition and the bulk of it is now in
discounted and variable-rate products rather than fixed-rate mortgages'.
He said that Abbey's replacement of its previous range of fixed-rate
mortgages at the end of business on Wednesday by a new range with interest
rates up to two annualised percentage points higher reflected the increasing
costs of funding fixed rates on the wholesale money markets.
Fixed-rate mortgages were the subject of intense competition among lenders
last year and earlier this year. But a number of lenders noticeably raised
their fixed-rates in a series of moves from late February onwards. Many
longer-term fixed rates are now more expensive than standard variable rates.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Upturn hits overseas earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's economic recovery had an unexpected side effect last year - it
reduced overseas earnings from the financial services sector.
Overseas earnings from activities such as banking, insurance and share
dealing fell to Pounds 15.6bn last year from Pounds 16.1bn in 1992, figures
released by British Invisibles, a trade group, show.
The main reason for the fall was an improved performance by overseas banks
based in London. During the recession bad debt problems caused many banks
based in the UK to record losses, which count as a positive item in
Britain's accounts.
Last year economic recovery in Britain meant bad debt problems were reduced.
With improved profits from securities dealing this meant overseas banks
could report and remit surpluses to parent companies. These count as a
negative item on Britain's accounts.
The result was that the UK's income from direct investment, which recorded a
surplus of Pounds 1.14bn in 1992, registered a deficit of Pounds 1.66bn last
year.
Mrs Alison Wright, director general of British Invisibles, said the increase
in overseas banks' profits 'augurs well for London's continued pre-eminence
as an international banking centre'.
The decline in earnings from direct investment was partly offset by two
improvements in the financial services accounts. Strong capital markets
meant that the net overseas earnings of UK securities dealers rose to Pounds
3.47bn last year from Pounds 2.53bn in 1992.
Secondly, underwriting at Lloyd's of London, the insurance market, having
recorded losses in 1990-1992, managed a small Pounds 76m surplus in 1993.
Such figures for Lloyd's are calculated on a cashflow basis, rather than on
the traditional basis under which results are not announced for three years.
British Invisibles splits the overall figures for financial services
earnings into two components: services, including fees, commissions,
insurance and share dealing profits; and investment income, including
portfolio investment by pension funds and direct investment.
While net earnings from services increased to Pounds 9.36bn last year from
Pounds 8.35bn in 1992, earnings from investment fell to Pounds 6.24bn from
Pounds 7.72bn over the same period.

FT  02 SEP 94 / ABB to shed 289 train plant jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABB Transportation's train and tram-building works in York is to shed 289
jobs, the company said yesterday.
The redundancies follow a shortage of orders at the plant, which has no work
beyond October next year.
ABB Transportation, part of Asea Brown Boveri, said it could see a long-term
future, but was facing a short-term crisis. Mr Bo Sodersten, managing
director and chief executive, said it was essential that new orders were won
quickly.
Mr Bill Beaman, the plant's engineering and electrical union convenor, said
redundancies had been expected, but not so many.
Mr Frank Dobson, shadow transport secretary, said the redundancies were the
result of the freeze on investment caused by rail privatisation.
ABB said it was chasing orders under the government's private finance
initiative. Today its Derby plant will submit a tender worth about Pounds
750m to London Underground for new Northern Line trains.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Lloyd's re-enters export credit insurance market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After an absence of more than 70 years Lloyd's is to re-enter the export
credit insurance market. Syndicate 33, managed by Hiscox, a prominent agent,
said yesterday that it was to lead a new insurance facility through the
Lloyd's market which would offer short-term cover against the insolvency or
default of trade debtors, Christopher Price writes.
Mr Neil Ross at the underwriter said that Hiscox's entry into the market
would give exporters a wider choice and allow them to gain cover for both
trade and political risk. He said, however, that he did not foresee the new
competition having an impact on premiums. Income on export credit premiums
is more than Dollars 1bn a year.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Credit data signal patchy recovery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gillian Tett, Economics Staff
The patchy nature of the recovery in consumer sentiment in the aftermath of
April's tax increases was highlighted yesterday.
New credit data showed lending in the retail and new-car loans sector weaker
than expected in July, while home loans fell sharply compared with a year
ago.
Lending in finance houses remained relatively strong, suggesting that
consumers took advantage of heavy discounting in the summer sales.
The report, by Infolink, the independent credit group, shows credit in the
retail sector 6.7 per cent higher in July than in July last year.
This annual growth rate was lower than in June, when lending was 13.1 per
cent higher than in the same period a year ago. Infolink said yesterday that
some of this fall might reflect high street sales, which might have
encouraged consumers to use cash rather than credit for smaller items.
Lending by the finance house sector - which covers 'in-store' credit schemes
for the purchase of expensive goods such as like televisions - performed
well in the month. Lending in this sector was 18.1 per cent higher - the
biggest annual growth rate seen in this sector this year, Infolink said.
A fall in the annual growth rate of new-car loans suggested that consumer
confidence might be faltering in other sectors. Lending in the new-car loans
sector was 3.8 per cent higher in July, compared with the same period a year
ago. In June annual growth was 7.5 per cent.
Lending in the home-loans sector, which represents specialist home-loan
companies and centralised lenders, was 14 per cent lower than in the same
period last year.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Miners reject severance deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
About 1,300 coalminers may be facing early redundancy after refusing to
accept a British Coal deal linking severance terms with flexible working.
Although there will be no threat to their jobs before coal privatisation in
December, they are likely to be among the first targets if the new owners
consider rationalisation necessary.
Those who refuse to sign would be relatively cheap to make redundant. They
would be entitled to the statutory minimum redundancy payment of less than
Pounds 6,300, while their 12,000 colleagues who have accepted the package
will be eligible for up to Pounds 27,000.
The deal also offered one-off payments of Pounds 6,000 but obliged miners
who accepted it to work shifts and at weekends.
Most of the miners who refused to sign are based at Kellingley, Maltby,
Stillingfleet and Longannet. The deadline for accepting the deal, which was
opposed by unions, was Wednesday.
Meanwhile British Coal said yesterday that a new processing facility at its
Gascoigne mine in Selby would be able to supply 750,000 tons of coal a year
for the domestic and industrial markets.
Although the corporation said the coal was intended to replace imports, the
development will worry private companies which have taken over nine pits
closed by British Coal in the past 18 months.
The private miners are aiming their products at the industrial and domestic
markets.
British Coal also said that it was exploring the feasibility of extending
workings at its Whitemoor pit in Selby.
The corporation said extending the mine's reserves beyond the River Derwent
would enable it to operate well into the next century.

FT  02 SEP 94 / FA Cup gains a sponsor
</HEADLINE>

   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Littlewoods Pools yesterday became the first sponsor of the 123-year-old
English Football Association Cup in a deal worth Pounds 14m, Neil Buckley
writes.
Together with investment in support activities, Littlewoods is committing a
total of Pounds 20m over four years - the biggest-ever sports sponsorship
package. The company will have its name attached to the FA Charity Shield as
well as the Cup.
The FA launched a marketing programme in June combining the commercial
rights of the FA and Wembley Stadium, called Total Football. Companies
joining the programme were given the opportunity to become 'presenting
sponsor' of the FA Cup. The FA selected Littlewoods, a family-owned football
pools and retailing business, as the 'ideal candidate'.
Littlewoods has previously sponsored the League Cup.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Approval for fifth TV channel likely soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Independent Television Commission hopes to announce approval for a fifth
national TV channel in the next two weeks.
The final decision has yet to be taken by the members of the commission, but
there are growing signs that the new channel is likely to go ahead and that,
in theory, the channel could reach as much as 70 per cent of the UK
population.
If the ITC decided to go ahead the new channel would be advertised in
November, with bids expected to be submitted in two or three months. A
similar period would be needed to look at the plans submitted and choose a
winner by April or May next year.
The main work being undertaken by the commission is to try to win permission
to use more frequencies for the channel, to take it beyond a minimum
guaranteed coverage of about 52 per cent of the population. Its difficulty
is that information on the frequencies which could be used will not be
available in time for a decision on the channel.
There seems to be growing interest in bidding for the channel, particularly
from the US and Canada, even though some of the potential frequencies have
been reserved for the development of digital terrestrial television in the
UK. As well as launching a fifth channel using existing technology, 12 new
digital terrestrial channels would be feasible.
An important option which the ITC is believed to be looking at would involve
asking bidders to do an analysis in their business plans looking at the
possibilities for coverage of between 50 per cent and 70 per cent.
This would enable the work on the channel to go ahead while the ITC sought
permission to use the maximum number of frequencies. Agreement would have to
be obtained from neighbouring countries, particularly the Irish Republic.
A winner could be chosen but the licence not be awarded until the maximum
possible coverage was known.
The situation is complex and the largest number of homes covered may not
necessarily make the most viable business, because of the need for new
aerials.
One option being considered would produce about 60 per cent coverage but
limit the need for new aerials.
Those who have expressed interest in the channel range from NBC and other US
networks to Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group and a consortium bringing
together Time Warner of the US; MAI, the UK television and financial
services group; and Pearson, the media group that owns the Financial Times.

Changes in the security standards of the electricity transmission system in
England and Wales could result in significant cost savings but would
increase the risk of interruptions in supply, says a report by the National
Grid.
The report, requested by Offer, the electricity regulator, says the majority
of those who experience loss of supply, such as big energy users and the
regional electricity companies, would prefer to retain the existing
standards.

The International Petroleum Exchange yesterday fined GNI, a commodities and
futures firm, Pounds 21,600.
The exchange said it had found breaches of its rules and procedures after
investigating trades by GNI staff and Mr Michael Angel, who trades on the
floor of the exchange on his own account.
The breaches included executing a number of trades other than by open
outcry, failing to register or properly execute a number of cross-trades and
two instances of trading away from the market price, thereby abusing a
client order.
Mr Angel was fined Pounds 10,450 and suspended for one month.
One of the directors of GNI is Mr Christopher Sharples, who is chairman of
the Securities and Futures Authority, the self-regulating body for the
securities industry.

FT  02 SEP 94 / ID cards still unpopular
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British public retains an ingrained aversion to the introduction of
identity cards.
A poll by MORI for the computer company ICL found that almost 50 per cent of
1,029 people interviewed were against the idea. About 33 per cent were
strongly opposed.
Those polled (510 men and 519 women) were asked if they would like an ID
card incorporating their photo and fingerprint and various personal details.
About 37 per cent were in favour. Only 16 per cent were in strong agreement.
The poll found that 51 per cent would like to see their photograph on their
credit cards, especially men, who were 57 per cent in favour, compared with
45 per cent of women.
Almost 32 per cent of respondents would like to see their fingerprints
incorporated.
Although identity cards are common in Europe there is a deep-seated mistrust
of them in Britain. They conjure up images of a police state, and part of
the dislike is thought to date from the second world world, when they were
introduced in Britain. They were abolished for most purposes in 1952.
There has, however, been much discussion in government about the
introduction of national ID cards and Mr John Major, the prime minister, is
said to favour them.
The only proposals which have been made are that driving licences have a
photo attached from 1996 and that a pilot scheme using cards for social
security claimants be introduced from next year.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Man held over Polly Peck shooting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ISTANBUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
One man was being held in an Istanbul prison yesterday and an arrest warrant
had been issued for two others in connection with the shooting last month of
a UK accountant working for Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the court-appointed
administrators of Polly Peck International, the collapsed conglomerate.
Mr Islam Elma was being held at Bayrampasa prison under a court order
pending trial related to the shooting of Mr David Adams, who received five
gunshot wounds to the leg.
Mr Elma, 21, reportedly told police he had mistaken Mr Adams for Mr Chris
Howells, the accountant directly involved in trying to recover the local PPI
assets.
Last night lawyers working for the administrators had still to be provided
with copies of the court proceedings. But local newspapers reported that Mr
Elma and two others had been offered TL250m (Pounds 5,000) and shares in
Vestel Electronik, PPI's listed Istanbul consumer electronics subsidiary, to
shoot the Coopers accountant.
The attack follows a pattern of intimidation of officials connected to the
administration.
Mr Asil Nadir, the former PPI chairman, has attempted to block court moves
by the administrators to gain access to the remaining Turkish and Cypriot
assets.
According to PPI's 1989 accounts the local companies - Near and Middle East
companies - generated two-thirds of the Pounds 160m reported group profit.
Two months ago Mr Howells was left with head injuries after being mugged
outside his Istanbul apartment. Last year a lawyer working for the
administrators in Cyprus and the former banker of Mr Nadir found dead
chickens nailed to the gateposts of their homes.
Mr Elma is said to have confessed to the attack after being apprehended in
the act of another shooting, according to the newspaper reports. His mother
had threatened to jump off the Bosporus bridge to protest his innocence.
Mr Elma is understood to have been recruited by Mr Erkan Kenanoglu, an
Iskenderum based businessman, who was also wanted for questioning.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Bill for remand prisoners is Pounds 200m a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Holding prisoners on remand before trial is costing the Prison Service more
than Pounds 200m a year, the National Audit Office says in a report
published today.
The public spending watchdog says half the cost is for prisoners awaiting
trial in the Crown Court, which deals with more serious criminal cases in
England and Wales. Waiting times for a Crown Court trial averaged 13.7 weeks
in 1992.
There is a statutory maximum waiting time of eight weeks, but this is
treated as advisory, the audit office says. Only 6 per cent of courts met
the deadline in 1992.
The audit office says that some of the reasons for delays are beyond the
control of the courts. These include lawyers not being ready and witnesses
not turning up.
Many cases listed for trial do not take place - about half because the
defendant changes his plea to guilty at the last moment. The cost of a
wasted day in the Crown Court can be as high as Pounds 5,900 in fees to
lawyers, legal aid and expenses for jurors and witnesses.
But more effective use of court resources could reduce delays, the report
says. Some courtrooms are unused for up to a third of the time, and courts
sit for an average of 4.3 hours a day.
The growing number of remand prisoners awaiting trial is the single biggest
factor behind prison overcrowding, according to the audit office.
Many of those held on remand are not sent to prison when convicted, the
report says. Just over half of those found guilty in 1992-93 were given
custodial sentences on conviction.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Success of youth training questioned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government training programmes for young people and their success in
providing qualifications were criticised by the Unemployment Unit yesterday.
The unit, which campaigns for better opportunities for young people, said
previously unreleased data for 1992-93 showed that only 21 per cent of
leavers from Youth Training, the training scheme for people aged 16 to 19,
achieved a National Vocational Qualification at level 2 - the vocational
equivalent of 4 GCSEs.
Nearly three-fifths of all YT trainees dropped out early, and half of all
leavers failed to get any kind of qualification or credit towards one.
The unit said the poor performance was not just a consequence of the
characteristics of the client group but the result of poor-quality
programmes and the qualifications which were prescribed by government
funding priorities.
The Department of Employment said the proportion of YT trainees studying for
a qualification had increased by 50 per cent since 1987-88.
It added that more than 70 per cent of trainees completing gained a
qualification or credits towards one.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Arms-to-Iraq report held over to 1995
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The publication of the report from Lord Justice Scott into the sale of
defence equipment to Iraq has been delayed until early next year, it was
announced yesterday.
The need to gather and assess additional evidence has led to the postponing
of the report's release, originally scheduled for this autumn, the inquiry
team said yesterday.
Lord Justice Scott has also decided to question two witnesses from the
Secret Intelligence Service or MI6, it was disclosed.
One of the witnesses is a serving MI6 officer and the other a former officer
with the secret service. The judge's decision to question them face-to-face
follows extensive recent requests to both witnesses to supply further
written evidence.
These requests followed evidence given to the inquiry by other witnesses
about the role played by MI6 when defence-related equipment was exported to
Iraq.
The two witnesses will be questioned about MI6's concerns regarding the
Iraqi procurement network and the service's involvement in the consideration
of granting export licences for defence equipment - in particular the
contracts awarded to Matrix Churchill, the Midlands engineering company, for
the export of 'dual-use' machine tools will be looked at.
The two MI6 witnesses will give evidence in closed sessions later this
month. The exact dates have not been released 'for reasons of national
security and for the personal safety of the officers concerned', the
statement said.
More than 30 other witnesses have been asked to provide further written
evidence to the inquiry since the public hearings ended in May.
No other face-to-face interviews with witnesses are planned. The statement
said, however, that no final decision about such sessions could be taken
now.
Mr Christopher Muttukumaru, the inquiry secretary, said: 'Lord Justice Scott
has already written a large part of the report and continues to write while
the investigative work goes on.
'Requests for evidence and for information are still being sent out. The
need to gather and assess additional evidence has inevitably extended the
timetable.
'The judge hopes to have completed the draft by the end of the year and he
will then give witnesses whom he proposes to criticise an opportunity to
comment before the report is finalised.'

FT  02 SEP 94 / Health officials forced to resign
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Eleven people have been forced to resign from health authorities after the
Department of Health discovered that they were not eligible for their posts.
The disclosure came at the same time as the government announced plans to
introduce more openness in the National Health Service.
The 11 non-executive part-timers were found to be serving on two authorities
each, which is against the regulations covering appointments.
A check on all the thousands of health authority members was carried out
after a similar case of a member serving on more than one authority was
discovered earlier this year. The 11 were allowed to choose which authority
they wished to remain on.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, said the issue was a 'genuine
mistake' arising from the complexity of the rules involved.
Mrs Bottomley yesterday launched a draft code of openness under which health
authorities and trusts will have to publish details of the money they spend
on red tape.
They will also be encouraged to publish summaries of their business plans,
give details of local waiting times, and reveal the number of complaints
received.
Information on the numbers of vaccinations and on cervical smear screening
should also be freely available.
Mrs Bottomley said being open with the public was 'an essential feature of a
good public service and must be part of the ethos of the NHS'.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Councils lack power of unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Company councils - the UK version of European works councils - are taken
seriously only where they have some power, according to a survey from the
independent employment analysts, Incomes Data Services.
Although such councils are relatively rare, more than 100 UK multinationals
will have to introduce them in the next few years under European
legislation.
Four of the six councils studied by IDS are non-union. IDS says councils
tend to be most common in non-union companies, organisations undergoing
widespread changes or wholly new enterprises such as Eurotunnel.
At Northumbrian Water, Monarch and Pitney Bowes, the councils negotiate pay
settlements; at Eurotunnel and Allied Colloids they discuss pay settlements,
but have no power to negotiate, while at HP Bulmer pay remains the province
of the unions.
The councils tend to cover all manual and most white-collar employees. In
most of the councils, employee representatives are elected by secret ballot.
In some cases, the turnout in elections was close to 100 per cent.
But if a council is not taken seriously by the employer, there will be a
lack of interest among employees, leading to shortage of candidates for
election.

FT  02 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Peril of fragmentation over free trade
pacts - UN economist warns Latin America against forming 'fortresses'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Latin America must not allow the web of free trade agreements across the
region to fragment into 'four or five fortresses', but should strive for
greater integration, the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the
Caribbean urges.
Bilateral and multilateral accords, now numbering more than 30, could 'merge
into one great bloc or, on the downside, divide the region,' Mr Gert
Rosenthal, commission executive secretary, said in an interview.
As well as 22 bilateral accords, several sub-regional pacts have been formed
recently, including the tripartite North American Free Trade Agreement of
the US, Canada and Mexico; the Mercosur customs union of Argentina, Brazil,
Paraguay and Uruguay; and the Group of Three, made up of Mexico, Colombia
and Venezuela.
Blocs are also emerging in Central America and the Caribbean basin.
Mr Rosenthal said there was a danger that the outbreak of such accords was
merely re-directing trade rather than creating it. Regional trade had grown
'spectacularly' - exports within the region have increased at 50 per cent a
year since 1990 - but it was very difficult to pinpoint cause and effect.
'We don't know how much of (the increasing trade) is due to the existence of
preferential treatment, how much is due to the indirect effect of business
communities becoming aware of each other, or how much would have happened
anyway in the absence of a trade agreement.'
What seemed certain was that nations on the margins of free trade pacts  -
such as Caribbean states in the case of Nafta - were likely to lose out,
both in terms of trade and of investment, he said.
Even Brazil, Latin America's largest economy, had claimed that preferential
agreements within Nafta, particularly those pertaining to capital goods, had
resulted in lost trade worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
Multiple pacts had also created an administrative bureaucracy that militated
against efficient commerce, Mr Rosenthal said. Tariffs on the same product
could vary enormously, depending on the country of origin and the stage of a
given treaty, most of which phased in preferential treatment.
Mr Rosenthal was not seeking to call a halt to the process. 'What we're
saying is: 'Why don't you proceed with these trade agreements in such a way
as to minimise the risks of trade deviation and maximise the potential of
trade creation?''
Governments could move in this direction by standardising trade agreements,
using Gatt rules as their starting point, and by broadening the range of
goods covered by pacts. Nations should join existing accords rather than
form bilateral alliances. 'It is ridiculous that there are 22 bilateral
trade agreements. We would like to see them multilateralised as quickly as
possible.'
In this respect, Mr Rosenthal thought Chile should join Nafta, rather than
sign a separate accord with the US. He also supported Chile's initiative to
become an associate member of Mercosur.
'I would like to see Chile taking on both commitments simultaneously,' he
said. 'Conceptually, they are not saying they are going to join Nafta but
turn their back on the rest of the region. They are trying to do in practice
what we are preaching - that is to take on multiple commitments.'
On the positive side, Mr Rosenthal thought that Latin American governments,
nearly all civilian and democratically elected, shared a political vision of
closer integration. 'There is a more favourable environment for actually
doing these things. There was a lot more rhetoric 10 or 15 years ago.'
The concept of integration, in the 1960s driven by notions of import
substitution, has now shifted to free-market terrain. 'Governments are
trying to rediscover the meaning of international integration in a more open
trading system.'
But the danger of economic fortresses and continental fragmentation still
existed. One possibility - 'not necessarily desirable' - was that political
realities in the US would halt the expansion of Nafta and that Brazil's
proposal for a South American free-trade area would take off. 'Maybe, by
2000, you will have a fairly solid regional bloc in South America and
another in North America.
'It is too early to tell where all this will lead,' Mr Rosenthal said. 'It
could have a happy ending. On the other hand, the ending may be more
complex.'

FT  02 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Toyota signals hopes to step up China role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Toyota yesterday gave the strongest indication yet of its interest in
setting up vehicle manufacturing operations in China, with the announcement
that it would establish a support centre for component suppliers there.
This came as Mr Tatsuro Toyoda, president of Japan's largest car company,
flew to Beijing yesterday, with other senior Toyota executives on a five-day
tour to strengthen ties with Chinese leaders and investigate the market.
Mr Toyoda, who is leading a group of Japanese vehicle parts executives, will
discuss the plan with the Chinese government and local vehicle makers.
The establishment of a supplier support centre is in response to calls by
the Chinese government for foreign manufacturers to help the country develop
its motor vehicle parts industry.
In July, China announced a moratorium on all new vehicle manufacturing
facilities until 1996 and invited foreign companies to extend support in
building up the country's components industry.
The establishment of a supplier support centre, where Toyota engineers would
extend technical assistance to parts suppliers, is not in itself a big
commitment by Toyota to the Chinese market. However, the move reflects
Toyota's interest in establishing manufacturing facilities in China, once
the government moratorium on new facilities has been lifted, and reflects
its belief in the potential of the Chinese market.
'It is a step looking towards the future and our ambitions for the Chinese
market,' a Toyota representative said yesterday. The company is considering
setting up a joint venture manufacturing facility in China, he said.
Toyota sold about 50,000 vehicles last year in China, or a quarter of all
Japanese vehicle sales in China and about 3 per cent of the entire Chinese
market of 1.5m.
The Japanese company provides technical assistance to a bus manufacturer in
Shenyang and an affiliate, Daihatsu Motor, extends similar help to a
passenger car maker in Tianjin. Toyota itself, though, has been slow to
express an interest in manufacturing in China.
It was not among a handful of foreign car companies - including Peugeot,
Volkswagen and Chrysler - which were quick to set up joint ventures in China
while such investment was still open.
However, the company says it now feels the market has enough potential to
justify local manufacturing.

FT  02 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Seeking a glass breakthrough - A look at a
US-Japanese trade dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The warehouse of Matsumoto Avante, a Japanese glass wholesaler based in
Tokyo, is not the kind of place normally to be associated with trade
friction between the US and Japan.
Matsumoto is typical of small Japanese wholesale businesses, employing about
150 people and trying to make best of modest floor space in a country where
property is expensive. Matsumoto, like other glass wholesalers, is the
intermediary between manufacturer and user.
The future of such small wholesalers depends in part on the outcome of a
US-Japan trade dispute over the flat glass market, which threatens to
trigger sanctions against Japan and could change the way companies such as
Matsumoto have done business for generations.
Flat glass is used mainly in the construction and automobile industries.
Negotiators from the US and Japan faced each other this week in an effort to
resolve the row. It is one of the more thorny disputes among several which
the two sides hope to resolve shortly. The US has to decide whether or not
to start procedures under its Super 301 trade legislation against Japan.
Prospects for an agreement, however, remain slim.
The dispute over flat glass has all the ingredients of a classic US-Japan
trade row.
The US accuses Japan of having a an anti-competitive market dominated by a
handful of large domestic makers.
It says that there is a convoluted distribution system that relies on close
relationships between businessmen with stakes in the industry and others,
and that this system makes the market inaccessible to foreign players.
The Japanese government has responded with a promise to take action to make
life easier for outside pro-ducers.
At stake is a market worth nearly Y3bn (Dollars 30m) in domestic sales a
year, according to Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
The Japanese flat glass market, which has come under pressure in the past
few years during the prolonged recession, is dominated by three
manufacturers - Asahi Glass, Central Glass and Nippon Sheet Glass.
Asahi, which belongs to the Mitsubishi group, is 4.9 per cent owned by
Mitsubishi Bank and 4.7 per cent by Mitsubishi Trust. Nippon Sheet Glass, a
member of the Sumitomo group of companies, is 6.8 per cent owned by Sumitomo
Trust, 5.4 per cent by Sumitomo Life Insurance and 4.9 per cent by Sumitomo
Bank. Central Glass, meanwhile, has close relations with the Mitsui group,
with more than 11 per cent of its shares owned by Mitsui-related companies.
The US claims that a close-knit group controlling a significant market
breeds anti-competitive practices and creates a barrier to free market
forces. It frustrates the ambitions of foreign makers looking to expand
their business in Japan. The Japanese trade ministry counters, saying the
market is not as closed as it might seem. In fact, Japan has a small trade
deficit with the US in flat glass products.
Manfucturers in Japan, the US and the European Union produce primarily for
their domestic markets.
Last year, Japan imported Y5bn worth of flat glass from the US while it
exported only Y1.6bn in return. The amount of flat glass per capita that is
imported into Japan is 1.5 times higher in Japan than in the US. Foreign
glass accounted for 12.8 per cent of Japan's overall glass consumption in
1991, compared with 4.9 per cent in the US market, and 17.4 per cent in the
EU.
The trade ministry also objects to claims of anti-competitive activity,
citing an investigation by the Japanese Fair Trade Commission in June last
year which, it says, found no evidence of breach of anti-monopoly laws.
A more recent Japanese government survey of flat glass wholesalers,
conducted last December, found that the industry distribution system was
dominated by small wholesalers which have limited warehouse and
glass-cutting capacity, and little interest in handling foreign-made glass.
The wholesalers said they found foreign imports uncompetitive in quality,
delivery times and product reliability.
'We buy foreign product,' said a representative of Matsumoto Avante, 'but we
do so to keep it in stock. We can't use it for specific contracts because
delivery times are too long.'
Foreign companies have to make an effort if they want to increase
penetration of the Japanese market, Miti says.
The US companies looking to increase their share of the market have only a
handful of representatives in Japan, says one Miti official. If they can get
the kind of market share they already have with so little marketing effort,
they must consider themselves to be doing very well. But if they want to
compete with Japanese sales forces numbered in the thousands, they have to
try harder, he says.

FT  02 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Airline chiefs bemoan Dollars 10m-a-day
subsidies - FT Conferences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission is consulting the European airline industry and
governments on tightening existing state aid rules for airlines at a time
when government subsidies to European national carriers are running at a
rate of Dollars 10m a day.
But Mr Herman De Croo, chairman of the European Commission's independent
'wise men' committee for air transport, yesterday warned at a Financial
Times aerospace conference that there was a risk that carriers seeking
subsidies would receive their share of state aid before stricter guidelines
came into force.
The 'wise men' committee, which was set up by the Commission last year to
draw up recommendations on the future of the European airline industry, is
also due to meet at the end of this month Mr Marcelino Oreja, the new
European Transport Commissioner,to discuss the issue.
One of the principal recommendations the committee made in its report in
February was the establishment of clear guidelines on airline subsidies.
But Mr De Croo noted that in July alone, the Commission approved state aid
totalling Dollars 7.1bn to three airlines including TAP Air Portugal,
Olympic Airways of Greece and Air France.
'This means that since August 1991, the Commission has approved state aids
to European airlines totalling Dollars 10.35bn. That's roughly Dollars 10m a
day,' he told the FT conference.
'The tragedy of it all is that when the economy is improving, air transport
is on the upswing, and most big airlines are finally making money, a hard
core of state-owned majors appear unable to take any medicine at all,' he
added.
Some European governments under political pressure from their country's
labour organisations have in turn placed significant pressure on the
Commission to allow state aid to airlines, Mr De Croo said.
The Commission's recent approval of state aid to a number of European
airlines, especially a FFr20bn (Dollars 3.7bn) package to Air France, also
came under heavy attack from senior airline industry executives at the FT
conference.
Mr Robert Ayling, group managing director of British Airways, said the
combined effects of liberalisation and the recession had created a two class
airline industry in Europe.
The first involved airlines which have had to solve their problems on their
own; the second included airlines which continued to defy the laws of
economics and had enjoyed a bumper year for subsidies.
'We don't see why Air France should be protected to the detriment of other
airlines which are not allowed to dip into their taxpayers pockets,' he
said.
The issue of state aid was an important test for the Commission. So far, Mr
Ayling said Brussels had 'dramatically failed' this test and done 'lasting
damage' to its reputation.
Mr Jan Stenberg, president of Scandinavian Airlines System, also said the
Commission's policy on state aid would slow down the overall European air
transport deregulation process.
The policy was also attacked by Mr Hans Mirka, head of international
operations at American Airlines, one of the two biggest US carriers, who
said the recent subsidies to Air France, TAP and Olympic equalled over 40
per cent of the total losses on all western airline scheduled international
passenger services in the past four years.
He also said several European governments had moved aggressively to restrict
the ability of US airlines to fly to and beyond their markets.
If other governments failed to match the US commitment to real competition,
the US would be unable to continue its pro-competitive policies in
international aviation, he said 'the result will inevitably be a return to
the protectionism of the past.'

90m people is by far the biggest nation in Africa.
Until 1988, when Prof Olikoye Ransome-Kuti, then health minister, launched a
national population policy, Nigerians had been so proud of their self-styled
tag as the 'giant of Africa' that, as long as the oil money rolled in, they
regarded high population growth as healthy and saw little point in
controlling the rate of growth.
Nigeria was then believed to have at least 110m people, putting it among the
10 largest populations in the world. The 1991 census caused a surprise:
Nigeria had only 88.5m. The over-estimate was a result of inflated numbers
by tribal chiefs and regional governors hoping to boost their political
clout and revenue allocation.
The United Nations Population Fund has projected the average population
growth rate between 1990 and 1995 as 3.1 per cent (which would double the
population in about 30 years) with the birth rate at 45 per 1,000 persons
and death rate at 14 per 1,000 (including an infant mortality rate of 96).
The UN estimates the fertility rate at 6.1 children per woman, while the
national policy set a target of only four. Since the 1970s the urban
population has risen from 30 per cent to nearly half and the rate of growth
in the towns is higher at 5.5 per cent.
Generalising about Nigeria, a country of over 200 ethnic groups and very
diverse cultures, is often deceptive and never more so than in attitudes to
education and the role of women.
In the mainly Christian south, female education and literacy are far higher
than in the predominantly Moslem north, where even the discussion of birth
control is not widely accepted.
In the south-east there is a high percentage of Catholics especially among
the Ibo tribe. The alarming decline in social services during the 1990s has
halted the progress towards family planning clinics and universal primary
education, especially in the north, bolstering the influence of the Koranic
schools.
Even nationally, the UN paints a bleak picture. 'The status of women in
Nigeria has improved little over the last decade. In general, they are
considered second-class citizens not by law but because of the social and
cultural climate', says the UNFPA's 1993 review of the national programme.
The literacy rate for women was 31 per cent (54 per cent for men) and more
than half of all Nigerian women were married at the age of 15.
The problem of education lies not just with women. As a prominent women's
group in Nigeria points out, there may be a target of four children per
woman, but in a polygamous society many men far exceed that figure.
If the prospect of curtailing population growth is limited, the outlook for
economic growth has become bleak. Despite the massive oil boom in the 1970s,
the GDP income per capita is down to around Dollars 290, about the level of
1963. In the period, Indonesia has risen from a lower per capita income to a
level three times that of Nigeria.
In January's budget speech the finance minister, Mr Kalu I Kalu, commented
on three years of political uncertainty, capital flight government
over-spending, which 'resulted in a further decline in GDP growth rate from
4.8 per cent in 1991 to 2.9 per cent in 1993. A comparison with the average
growth rate of 5 per cent from 1988-91 demonstrates the enormity of the task
involved in resuscitating the economy in 1994 and beyond,' concluded Mr
Kalu.
Since then strikes, shortages and a dearth of foreign exchange have taken
the economy further down hill. Nigeria accounts for about half of West
Africa's population and whereas Ghanaians once poured into Nigeria for a
better life, the chances of reverse migration look more likely.

FT  02 SEP 94 / 'Mr Clean' foresees new power bloc: Japan could soon have a
cohesive opposition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's fragmented opposition parties are just weeks away from pooling
forces to create the first powerful opposition group for nearly 50 years.
That is the belief of former prime minister Toshiki Kaifu, 64, father of the
reforms to have swept Japanese politics over the past year. The 'Mr Clean'
of Japanese politics yesterday took a break from campaigning in his home
prefecture of Aichi, the heartland of the Japanese car industry, which is
due for a critical by-election in 10 days, to explain his hopes.
If Mr Kaifu is right, Japan's frustrated economic partners will have cause
to throw their hats in the air. Lack of a coherent opposition during nearly
four decades of one-party rule by the conservative Liberal Democratic party
is commonly held to have suffocated political debate.
This has bolstered the power of the state bureaucracy, often tempted by
economic protectionism, which is blamed for contributing to Japan's huge
current account surplus. The new group, provisionally named the 'new-new
party' by the Japanese press, would have about 200 lower house seats, so
rivalling the LDP for size.
Mr Kaifu created a stir two months ago by leaving the LDP, in a failed
attempt for the premiership, which was seen by his enemies as fumbled
opportunism. He was prompted, he said, by distaste for his colleagues'
decision to form a coalition with the LDP's traditional foe, the Social
Democratic party, to attain the parliamentary majority needed to return to
power after a humiliating year in opposition.
'The LDP lost all the honour of the past by choosing a prime minister from
the SDP, just to get back into government. It is my responsibility, as the
one who started reform, to say this was wrong,' said Mr Kaifu. He had
repeatedly warned that the LDP was losing its way ever since being ousted by
the old guard three years ago for being too keen on reform.
In the weeks since leaving the LDP, Mr Kaifu has built a prominent place in
the pro-reform opposition. He is working with Japan's other two most popular
post-war prime ministers, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa and Mr Tsutomu Hata, to
create the new super-party, the subject of intense backroom bargaining over
the past month.
Mr Kaifu was certain the 10 parliamentary opposition groups will shortly
agree a common policy platform and joint electoral candidates. 'I assure you
we will succeed,' he said. He is ostentatiously non-committal on suggestions
that he is a candidate to lead the new super-party.
Much depends on the outcome of the Aichi by-election for an upper house seat
on September 11. It will give a measure of Mr Kaifu's own electoral value,
as leader of the campaign, and could help win over those opposition members
still doubtful about joining the super-party. It will also be watched
closely by the government coalition, as the first election test since it
grabbed power at the end of June.
Aichi's upper house poll will also give a clue to whether or not political
reform really will shake up Japan's power structure, because it will take
place under electoral rules similar to those due to come into effect for the
more powerful lower house next year.
There will be single candidates from the government and opposition coalition
groups, fighting openly for a single seat, rather than a cosy share-out of
several seats, as under the old multi-seat constituency system.
Mr Kaifu, making a brief stop in his Tokyo office before returning to Aichi
to campaign for the opposition candidate there, believes the outcome will
make or break the government. 'It is going to be difficult for an
administration composed of opposite poles to come up with an ideology. The
only way they can survive is to maintain the status quo,' he said.
'The SDP and LDP are like oil and water. They cannot compromise, and can
only delay on important decisions like tax and post-war reparations,' he
argues.
In theory, the opposition should have an advantage in Aichi. Mr Koshiro
Ishida, chairman of the Buddhist-backed Komeito, the Clean Government party,
the second largest opposition group, has a seat there. There is also support
from local unions linked to the Democratic Socialist Party, an important
opposition group supported by Toyota, the powerful car maker based there.
All this invites the question of whether the reforms started by Mr Kaifu in
1991 really will produce a new breed of skilled politicians better able to
make policies that respond to voters' aspirations, rather than scheme for
power.
'Yes, reform did go through a lot of detours,' he admitted, referring to the
success of LDP party elders in watering down his original plans. Yet a vital
general principle has been introduced. Politicians will henceforth be held
more directly accountable for their policies, by virtue of a more
competitive electoral system, Mr Kaifu argued.
That will make the job of prime ministers in the mid-1990s far harder than
was the case when Mr Kaifu held the post. When asked if he wants another
crack at the leadership, post-reform, Mr Kaifu laughed uproariously. 'That's
not in my mind just now,' he said. 'I just want politics to be clean.'

FT  02 SEP 94 / Jiang set to raise profile with tour

<TEXT>
When President Jiang Zemin of China arrives in Moscow today at the start of
a four-day visit, his purpose will be twofold: he will be seeking to promote
a closer commercial and strategic partnership with Russia and at the same
time boosting his own stock on the international stage.
With China in a transitional phase in preparation for a new generation of
leaders (Mr Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader, is in failing health), it
is important for Mr Jiang to assume the aura of an international figure.
His visit to Moscow, and subsequently to Ukraine and France, is part of
attempts to bolster his appeal. It follows his appearance at the Asia
Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) forum in Seattle last November, which
was also aimed at enhancing his credibility at home and abroad.
Mr Jiang is due to initial a document on border demarcation in the remote
western region of China and sign an accord in which the two countries agree
not to target each other with nuclear missiles.
All this is a far cry from the tension between the communist giants in the
early 1960s, which led to a brief border war and frequent skirmishes. When
Mr Jiang initials the border agreement, 99 per cent of border disputes will
have been resolved, according to an official Xinhua news agency despatch.
The two sides will also sign a communique aimed at providing a framework for
development of political and commercial ties into the next century. While
two-way trade at Dollars 2.245bn (Pounds 1.46bn) for the first six months of
this year is down 39 per cent on the same period last year, Beijing and
Moscow envisage the continued development of a substantial trading
relationship.
Two-way trade reached Dollars 7.68bn last year, an increase of 30 per cent
over the year before, making Russia China's seventh largest trading partner.
Exchanges this year have been hit by a 50 per cent slump in the first six
months in border trade because of disagreements over customs and immigration
issues.
Russia is proving sensitive to a flood of Chinese traders moving across the
border into its far-eastern regions. Russian officials fear this is a form
of 'colonisation', with the Chinese over-staying their visas.
'This situation is not good and should be corrected or stopped,' Mr Jiang
told Russian reporters in Beijing this week, but he added, using a Chinese
idiom: 'These are only problems in the course of development. We should not
give up eating for fear of choking.'
Mr Jiang's visit to Moscow follows increasingly frequent contacts between
Chinese and Russian officials in the past year or so.
Russian visitors to China this year included Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the
prime minister, and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister. China's foreign
minister, Mr Qian Qichen and the defence minister, Mr Chi Haotian, both
visited Moscow this year.
China and Russia are seeking to extend their defence co-operation, with the
Chinese pressing the Russians to supply technology for a fighter aircraft.
China has also been a big purchaser of Russian defence equipment, with
orders for 26 Su27 fighters, and plans for another squadron.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China has approved its first private bank with the shareholders coming from
domestic private companies, according to the official Xinhua news agency,
Tony Walker writes.
The People's Bank, China's central bank, gave its approval to the new
institution as part of continuing reforms of the banking sector.
China has been licensing some new banks, but they have been connected with
public sector companies or municipalities.
Mr Jing Shuping, chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and
Commerce, said the new bank would not accept foreign shareholders, but it
would act for foreign clients.
Little detail of the new bank was provided in a brief Xinhua despatch, but
Mr Jing said the bank's initial capital would be Yn2bn (Pounds 151.5m).
The establishment of the privately owned bank was described as a
'significant experiment' in China's banking reforms.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Where Egypt boasts decade of progress: Population curbs have
worked, but there is still far to go
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
None of the women attending the Cairo Family Planning Association clinic in
the sprawling suburb of Zeinhom yesterday knew that the world's biggest
population conference was due to open up the road on Monday. Few probably
cared; none seemed the least persuaded that seeking family planning advice
might be un-Islamic.
'I'm convinced Islam is not against family planning,' said Hoda, a
30-year-old woman swathed in a black Hejab veil, the badge of Islamic piety.
'My brother-in-law is a religious man and he ordered his wife not to use
contraception. He tried to deter me, but I didn't listen. I encouraged all
my friends to come to the clinic. Now all of them blossom like fresh
jasmine.'
Hoda has stopped at five children, and was having a routine check on her
IUD, a visit which cost 25 piastres (about 5p) at this private clinic. Her
21-year-old sister had come along too. She has two daughters and said that
was enough: 'I have an IUD, and don't plan to have any more children. My
husband would like a son, but he doesn't pressure me.'
For most women visiting the clinic, said Dr Mawahab el-Mouelhy, a UK and
US-educated doctor, birth control is a practical consideration, determined
usually by women's concerns for their health and, perhaps more commonly,
because they simply cannot afford to clothe, feed, educate or house more
children.
For all the criticism by Egypt's religious conservatives of the population
policy agenda of Monday's International Conference on Population and
Development, the strictures of Islam have so far done little to put a brake
on a decade of progress in population control, which Egypt's policymakers
and aid workers consider little short of remarkable.
The population growth rate has plunged from 3 per cent to about 2.1 per
cent. A fertility rate of 5.3 in 1980 has come back to an average of 3.9
births per woman, 2.9 in urban areas. Knowledge of family planning among
married couples is almost universal, while 47 per cent of women use
contraception in Egypt (predominantly IUD devices and the pill) against 24
per cent in 1980.
Behind such results lie 20 years of concerted government policy, backed by
foreign aid, of which USAID has provided 75 per cent of all family planning
assistance, a total of about Dollars 170m (Pounds 113m), to fill the media
with birth control information and stock and staff hundreds of clinics,
enough for 96 per cent of all Egyptian women to be within 5km of a family
planning centre.
But cheered as the government and organisations such as USAID are by such
results, they remain far from meeting their ambition of creating for Egypt a
population growth which the country can comfortably sustain. At present
rates, Egypt's 60m population grows by 1m every 10 months.
The constraints on the country's most basic resources are severe enough; all
but 4 per cent of its 1m sq km is desert. A recent report by the UN's
Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia reckoned Egypt was consuming
95 per cent of its available water sources and faced a water deficit by the
year 2000.
By most estimates, the economy needs to generate about 500,000 jobs a year
to mop up new entrants to the labour force, implying an annual growth rate
of 5 per cent of GDP, more than twice the most optimistic estimates of
present growth. The World Bank reckons that at least 5m new jobs must be
created by 2000 even to halve the present unemployment rate of 20 per cent.
But population experts tend to agree that cutting the growth rate to perhaps
1.9 per cent is unlikely to come by providing more pills, coils or publicity
campaigns alone.
'There is something missing,' says Dr el-Mouelhy. 'Which is the status of
women in this country. We need to work hard on this. It's not just family
planning, its about education of women.'
Emphasis on the education of girls is a central theme of the conference's
draft document to be discussed next week in Cairo, and one which groups such
as USAID and the Population Council hope the conference's hosts will take to
heart. A well established concomitant between raised educational standards
among girls and subsequent falls in fertility rates is seen as the key to
future policy in countries such as Egypt, these groups argue.
A guide to the task lying ahead for Egypt lies in the fact that, by
conservative estimates, at least 66 per cent of Egyptian women are
illiterate.
Changing that will require more than the provision of teachers and schools,
of which Egypt must already build on average one a day to keep up with the
rise in schoolchildren. It will need an attempt to alter many ingrained
attitudes, and is likely to depend on an improved economic climate. All that
before the air can thicken with the scent of jasmine.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Morocco and Israel to open liaison offices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel and Morocco moved towards establishing full diplomatic relations
yesterday, marking a another breach in the wall of Arab economic and
political isolation which has surrounded the Jewish state since its creation
in 1948.
Morocco will become the second Arab state to have direct ties with Israel
after Egypt signed a full peace with its neighbour in 1979. Although Israel
and Morocco will initially open 'liaison offices' rather than embassies,
Israel's foreign ministry said its mission in Rabat and Morocco's mission in
Tel Aviv would be staffed by diplomats and cover all economic, cultural,
trade and diplomatic activities including issuing visas.
Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said the move paved the way to
'an opening of a regional system of relations'. Israeli officials said other
Arab and Islamic states, such as Tunisia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Kuwait and
Oman could soon follow Rabat's lead. They also said the step erodes the Arab
economic boycott of Israel, which the Israel Chambers of Commerce estimates
has cost the Jewish state about Dollars 50bn (Pounds 32bn) in lost trade and
investment since 1950.
Morocco's decision to open its liaison office in Tel Aviv follows
international diplomatic practice of not recognising Jerusalem as the
capital of Israel. King Hassan of Morocco is also chairman of the Islamic
Conference Organisation's Jerusalem committee and as such is committed to
reversing Israel's assertion of sovereignty over the city.
The kingdom also said, in a separate statement aimed at maintaining a
balance between Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas, it would open a
liaison office in Gaza for relations with 'Mr Yassir Arafat, President of
the State of Palestine'.
Israel has long maintained clandestine relations with Morocco and trade
between the two countries was estimated to be worth Dollars 100m last year.
Up to 600,000 Israeli Jews have Moroccan origins and both states believe the
potential for trade and tourism is considerable.
In October King Hassan of Morocco will host an international conference on
economic development in the Middle East sponsored by President Bill Clinton.
Hundreds of companies from Israel, Europe and Arab states are expected to
attend the Casablanca event to devise ways of financing multi-billion dollar
Middle East projects in the post-peace era.
Israelis, particularly Jews of Moroccan descent, will be overjoyed by the
move in a country where many people judge the peace process by the extent to
which it ends Israel's isolation.
Israeli businessmen will also hope relations with Morocco will help end the
Arab economic boycott. Jordan and Egypt both have formal trade relations
with Israel, Qatar is talking with Jerusalem about a natural gas project and
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have eased some of the boycott rules to attract US
companies which do business with Israel. Egyptian industrialists, who
visited Israel last week, said the time had come to 'warm-up' the
16-year-old 'cold peace' with Israel and forge much deeper economic, trade
and financial ties. A formal suspension of the boycott, however, is unlikely
until Israel withdraws from the still-occupied West Bank and Golan Heights.

Ms Vassilya Inoyatova, who leads the banned opposition group Birlik (Unity),
said earlier this week that she had been charged with breaking article 60 of
the Uzbek criminal code, after police found two sacks of the newspaper Erk,
also banned, in her flat. No date for her trial has yet been set. All
opposition activity is banned in Uzbekistan.

Labour unrest in South Africa drew a violent response from the security
forces yesterday when police fired on striking forestry workers, injuring at
least 20. Private security personnel used stun grenades and rubber bullets
to quell a disturbance by striking gold miners, Patti Waldmeir reports from
Johannesburg.
Five miners were injured in demonstrations, including a sit-in by 300 miners
underground at an Anglo American mine near Carletonville, south-west of
Johannesburg, the company said. Violence also broke out at a forestry
plantation near Piet Retief, close to South Africa's border with Swaziland.
Police said they fired birdshot to disperse 4,000 workers, injuring at least
20. Local officials of the African National Congress said four had died, but
police denied this.
Labour unrest, either backed by unions or unofficial, has increased in South
Africa since the black-majority government of President Nelson Mandela came
to power in May. Pay is the biggest issue, as black workers raise their
expectations following the demise of apartheid and white minority rule.

<TEXT>
Car sales in Japan showed their second successive month of growth in August,
rising at a sharply increased pace which industry officials said was
evidence demand was recovering, Gordon Cramb reports from Tokyo. The 9.3 per
cent year-on-year jump in unit sales of passenger cars, according to the
Japan Automobile Dealers' Association yesterday, compares with a 1.5 per
cent upturn in July.
Demand was strongest for new subcompact models, to which leading
manufacturers have attached competitive price tags. The figures exclude the
special category of mini-vehicles with an engine capacity below 660cc, sales
of which have been on a rising trend for some months.
Analysts said the improvement in the consumer market followed tax rebates
provided as part of a government package to stimulate the economy.
Sales of all vehicles except minicars and minivans rose 12 per cent, a third
successive gain and the first double-digit increase since August 1990. This
stemmed in part from an 18.6 per cent leap in truck sales. Many older
commercial vehicles are being replaced because of tightened emission and
load requirements.
Toyota, the motor industry leader, sold 14.6 per cent more vehicles than a
year ago, but the second-ranking Nissan remained out of favour, with a 3 per
cent fall.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Shingles drug output ordered suspended
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Japan's ministry of health and welfare yesterday ordered the suspension of
production of a shingles drug whose side effects allegedly killed 15
patients last year.
The ministry said Nippon Shoji violated the Drugs, Cosmetics and Medical
Instruments Law, as the company only reported one death of a patient during
clinical trials, when in fact three patients had died. The suspension will
last 105 days from next Monday.
Sorivudine, the shingles drug, was brought to the market last September, but
was withdrawn two months later following the deaths.
Until now, the health ministry, Nippon Shoji and doctors have been blaming
each other for the deaths. Doctors and the company have been pointing
fingers at the ministry for allowing the drug to be marketed in the first
place, while the doctors have been blamed for not reading the warning
against prescribing Sorivudine along with certain other drugs.
In order to avoid criticism, the ministry is not withdrawing official
approval of Sorivudine, since it would raise questions over why the
government authorised the drug in the first place.
Meanwhile, Nippon Shoji is under investigation from the Securities and
Exchange Surveillance Commission, for alleged insider trading. A total of
139 company employees and their relatives are alleged to have sold the
company's stock ahead of the announcement of the deaths.
Analysts say the suspension would be a blow to Nippon Shoji's earnings. Some
91 per cent of the company's revenue comes from drug wholesaling, but profit
margins on the business are thin and about a quarter of earnings derive from
drug manufacturing.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Argentina prepares more sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Argentine government is planning a second round of privatisations, to
complete its transfer of federal enterprises to the private sector, writes
Stephen Fidler.
Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, said the remaining privatisations, to
take place by the end of 1995, would include the sale of all airports, three
nuclear power plants, the post office, the federal mint and the country's
largest petrochemicals plant.
He gave no estimate of how much the new privatisations would raise.
The next round is to include enterprises which, for various reasons, it has
been difficult to privatise in the past.
Mr Cavallo, who was speaking to Argentine bankers, was also underlining the
government's determination to keep public finances in order through 1994 and
1995.
He announced a hiring freeze in the public sector, including the military,
and indicated vacancies would be left unfilled. Public spending on
non-salary, non-investment areas would also be cut by 10 per cent, he said.
The measures would save the equivalent of an estimated Dollars 2bn this year
and next.
In measures aimed at bringing more control of government spending to his
ministry, Mr Cavallo said all public contracts would be handled through the
economy ministry, as would regional development spending.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Implants settlement approved
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A US judge has approved a proposed Dollars 4.25bn (Pounds 2.76bn) settlement
for women around the world who have suffered ill-health as a result of
silicone breast implants, Richard Waters reports from New York.
The decision, by Judge Sam Pointer in a federal court in Alabama, followed
months of deliberation and brought one step closer the biggest US product
liability settlement.
However, the deal could still fail. Some 15,000 women have already chosen
instead to retain their rights to sue the implant manufacturers in US
courts. The manufacturers have warned they will abandon the global
settlement if too many women opt out of it, though they have not indicated
what level of acceptance is needed for the deal to stay.
Under the terms of the deal, all women are automatically covered by the
settlement - and lose their rights to sue - unless they explicitly opt out.
The settlement is meant to cover women who have already experienced medical
problems and those who develop problems in future, though opponents claim
that the amount of money being made available is too small and will be
quickly exhausted.
In one amendment to the original plan made by Judge Pointer, Dollars 96.6m
of the settlement will be made available to women outside the US, up from
the original Dollars 81m, but critics still maintain that this is far too
little.

FT  02 SEP 94 / US N-waste clean-up under attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US department of energy's programme for cleaning up nuclear waste sites
is extremely expensive and often ineffective, because of its failure to
adopt new technologies, according to a General Accounting Office report.
The congressional auditor's review of use of innovative technology in
nuclear waste operations notes that, although the department has received
Dollars 23bn (Pounds 14.9bn) for environmental management since 1989,
'little clean-up has resulted'.
The result has been that, during the last five years, only about 10 per cent
of the department's contaminated sites have been cleaned or closed, the GAO
observed. During the past 40 years, more than 1bn cubic feet of hazardous
and radioactive waste at weapons' plants has been disposed of. Many of the
containers housing that waste are now unsafe.
'As a result of earlier disposal practices, soil and groundwater
contamination is now widespread,' it said. The GAO said that more than 5,700
individual contaminated areas have been identified on department lands.
'Even where new technology has been successfully demonstrated, agency
officials are reluctant to try new approaches, tending instead to choose
conventional techniques to clean up their facilities,' the report says.
Resistance to innovative techniques is due in part to the department's
reliance on 'on-site contractors who may favour particular technologies on
the basis of their own experiences and investments', and local governments
which 'view faster clean-up as a threat to local economies' and see little
incentive to adopt more efficient methods.
The GAO stresses that developing less costly and more effective technologies
may be the only way the US can afford the cleansings, which the department
recently estimated would cost Dollars 300bn in the next 30 years.
The department, which requested the review in January 1993, said yesterday
it was taking steps to encourage technological innovation.
'This is a problem we've known about for some time and, over the last two
years, we have been trying to come up with ways of utilising new
technologies,' said Mr Gerald Boyd, director of the Office of Special
Projects in technology development.
However, the GAO pointed out that one of the other reasons for the tendency
to use conventional techniques was 'the co-ordination flaws in the
department's clean-up program. Individual offices have not worked together.
. . to overcome the resistance to using improved technology'.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Bermuda plans tougher rules for insurance market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bermuda government has announced plans to tighten its insurance
regulations, in a move designed to affirm the long-term stability and
financial health of its rapidly growing commercial insurance and reinsurance
market.
Over the last two years between Dollars 4.5bn and Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.2bn)
of capital has been pumped into the island, much of it directed towards the
formation of eight new companies specialising in catastrophe risk.
The government aims to update a framework developed largely to control an
industry dominated by captive companies - subsidiaries formed by industrial
and service companies mainly to insure the risk of their parents.
The changes, which are expected to come into force by the end of 1995, were
announced yesterday by Mr David Saul, the minister of finance, and include a
range of tough new requirements.
Highly capitalised insurers writing significant amounts of 'direct excess
liability' and/or 'property catastrophe reinsurance' will be required to
demonstrate minimum capital of Dollars 100m, while some other insurers will
also need to show higher levels of capital.
Solvency margins - the yardstick which compares net assets as a percentage
of premium income and measures the financial health of an insurer - are to
be radically tightened. These will be adjusted to levels which in some cases
are more stringent than the international norm. The heavily capitalised
companies will need to show solvency margins to at least 50 per cent, for
example.
'The significant changes that have taken place in the Bermuda marketplace
now require change in the insurance regulatory system,' said Mr Saul.

The US said yesterday its first round of talks with Cuba on migration was
'serious, professional and businesslike,' writes James Harding in
Washington. The Cuban delegation leader, Mr Ricardo Alarcon had said before
arriving in New York for the talks that the only way to stop the exodus of
Cuban refugees was to end the US trade embargo of the island.
But the US said the opening round 'focused exclusively on migration',
including US plans to accept more legal emigrants from Cuba, the stepping-up
of US legal action against illegal immigrants, and returning Cuban criminals
from US jails.
The talks were expected to continue today.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Bank regulators propose new rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US bank regulators are proposing new capital adequacy rules to take account
of banks' exposure to risk from their derivatives holdings.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates nationally
chartered banks, yesterday published the new rules for a two-month comment
period, and the Federal Reserve Board has also proposed similar rules.
An OCC official described the proposals as a 'refinement', but said they
could require banks to hold more capital to offset the risk of some of their
derivatives holdings.
The new rules would change the factors which estimate exposure, by
converting the notional principal amount of derivatives contracts into the
equivalent of loan, and would sharply increase the factors for contracts
linked to equity, precious metals other than gold, and commodities.
Earlier international standards for bank capital adequacy ratios agreed by
the Basle committee on banking supervision did not explicitly cover this
kind of contract, but many national bank supervisors, including the US, have
informally allowed banks to use the conversion factor applied to exchange
rate contracts, which is 1 per cent for less than one year and 5 per cent
for longer.
Under the new rules, gold would still use these factors, because its
volatility is estimated to be comparable to foreign exchange contracts, but
other contracts would be weighted more heavily.
Equity-linked contracts would have a conversion factor of 6 per cent of
notional principal amount for maturities under one year, 8 per cent for one
to five years and 10 per cent for longer terms. Other precious metals would
be weighted at 7 per cent for maturities up to five years and 8 per cent for
longer.
Other commodities would be weighted at 12 per cent up to five years, and 15
per cent for longer maturities.
The proposed rules would also recognise some netting arrangements that banks
enter into with partners as a way of reducing potential future exposure.

FT  02 SEP 94 / US manufacturing output slows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Activity in US manufacturing slowed down in August, but inflationary
pressures continued to rise, according to the National Association of
Purchasing Managers' monthly index.
The NAPM index fell to 56.2 per cent last month, a drop from the 57.8 per
cent recorded in July, but still a level indicating strong expansion of the
economy.
'The past relationship between the purchasing managers' index and the
overall economy indicates that if the PMI were to average 56.2 per cent for
all of 1994, then real gross domestic growth should approximate 4.2 per
cent,' said Mr Ralph Kauffman, chairman of the association's business survey
committee.
However, the NAPM's index of prices paid for materials rose in August to
74.5 per cent, with every manufacturing sector reporting higher prices in
August than in July.
'This increase in material prices is one of the strongest concerns of
purchasers, with some indicating inability to raise product prices to cover
the increased material prices,' said Mr Kauffman.
Poor delivery performance by suppliers was also now a prime concern for
purchasing executives, said Mr Kauffman, with deliveries becoming much
slower in August as many material suppliers were now operating at maximum
capacity. Printing and publishing, plastics and rubber, clothing, textiles
and glass were among the industries reporting the most trouble in obtaining
deliveries.
Financial markets, meanwhile, are closely watching today's employment
statistics for further confirmation that the pace of growth is slowing.
The unemployment rate dropped in July to 6.1 per cent, close to the rate at
which many economists believe the labour market will start to tighten and
wage demands start to rise, and a further drop could prompt the Federal
Reserve to tighten monetary policy further.
One indicator that has suggested there is more slack left in the labour
market is an index of help-wanted advertising compiled by the Conference
Board, a New York-based organisation with more than 2,000 companies among
its members. That index rose only slightly to 121 in July after dropping in
June.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Moscow warns on wages crisis: Late payments raise unrest
fear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Oleg Soskovets, Russia's first deputy prime minister, has warned that the
country's escalating late payments crisis could spark social unrest with
severe political repercussions.
According to Russian press reports, Mr Soskovets told a meeting of economic
ministers, bankers and industrialists on Wednesday that the failure of many
energy companies to pay their workers for months could prompt mass action by
coal miners and oil and gas workers. An Economics Ministry report estimated
that late payments of wages in industry and agriculture had risen from
Rbs800bn (Pounds 240m) at the beginning of the year to Rbs4,000bn (Pounds
1.2bn) by August 1, with the energy sector being badly hit.
The Russian government is grappling with ways of resolving the internal
debts crisis but appears torn between whether to stick to a strict monetary
path or try indirectly to inflate its way out of its difficulties by issuing
fresh credits.
Many Russian companies claim that the accumulation of inter-enterprise debt
 -now estimated at Dollars 45bn (Pounds 29bn) - has created a cash flow
crisis making it impossible for them to pay their workers. They are
demanding cash injections from the government to ease the liquidity problem.
The government commission for dealing with late payments, chaired by Mr
Soskovets, has proposed an alternative package of measures including:
Forcing companies to settle their rouble debts out of their hard currency
accounts. Many companies have hidden away funds in foreign bank accounts to
avoid paying taxes and to hedge against inflation.
Insisting that enterprises could not pay dividends until their outstanding
debts have been settled - a proposal which has prompted outrage among
industrial managers.
Greater investigating powers to assess the true financial state of troubled
companies.
Encouraging the use of promissory notes as a non-inflationary means of
settling debts.
Mr Anatoli Chubais, privatisation minister, has also suggested formal
bankruptcy procedures could be used more aggressively to concentrate the
minds of the managers of 200 companies which account for the bulk of the
inter-enterprise debt. Mr Chubais cited the example of the Kristal
enterprise, manufacturer of Stolichnaya vodka, which had suddenly 'found'
Rbs500m to repay a debt when it was threatened with bankruptcy.

sinking 10 steel cables up to 50m below ground and anchoring them to a

century tower, which leans about 5m off the perpendicular. The scheme is a
temporary solution until a more permanent way to stabilise the tower's

German companies and financial authorities have not benefited from the
expected savings following the abolition of VAT after the creation of the
European internal market in 1992, according to a government report. The new
VAT law which applies during the present transition period has created 'an
almost incomprehensible amount' of extra work, according to companies and
tax advisers. Government brochures, explaining the new regulations, were not
available soon enough, the report said. Companies, especially smaller and
medium-sized ones which were expected to benefit most from the single
market, complained about the extra work resulting from new reporting
requirements and more complicated searches for business partners' VAT
identification numbers. Financial and personnel savings had not been
possible, the report added, and differing legal and tax systems in the 12 EU
member countries meant that computer software programmes needed to be
constantly updated.

The chairman of the Ukrainian parliament's foreign affairs commission
signalled yesterday that the former Soviet republic might delay joining the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). President Leonid Kuchma (left) has
said he will present the NPT, under which Ukraine would give up nuclear
weapons permanently, to the communist-dominated assembly in October for
approval. President Kuchma is due to visit the US in November, and
Washington has put pressure on Kiev to join the pact. But Mr Boris Olinyk,
chairman of the influential foreign affairs commission, said parliament
would sign up for the NPT 'when we are ready'. 'This won't happen so
quickly. This time we have to be careful. One should not make romantic
statements about a non-nuclear zone when all around us are nuclear states.'
Many Ukrainian leaders, including Mr Alexander Moroz, chairman of
parliament, have criticised the US for dragging its feet on a promised
Dollars 350m (Pounds 225.8m) in disarmament aid.

Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, chairman of the French industrial group
Schneider, is to ignore a summons by Belgian authorities involved in a fraud
inquiry. A Belgian legal official said an investigating magistrate, Mr
Jean-Claude Van Espen, had summoned Mr Pineau-Valencienne to Brussels for an
interview tomorrow. On Wednesday Schneider said it had taken steps to get an
annulment of the legal proceedings taken against Mr Pineau-Valencienne in
Belgium which led to a 12-day spell in prison in late May and early June.
The company has said its chairman is willing to co-operate with Belgian
officials, but only in France and under the supervision of French legal
authorities.
Mr Pineau-Valencienne was arrested in May after he went voluntarily to
Brussels to be interviewed by Mr Van Espen, who is investigating alleged
fraud in the affairs of Cofibel and Cofimines, Schneider's Belgian units.
Schneider said its lawyers believed the magistrate violated the 1959
European Convention on judicial co-operation and Belgian rules of procedure
in criminal investigations.

FT  02 SEP 94 / European Profile: Lesson for man who hopes to tame Eta - The
Spanish justice minister's anti-terrorist policy appears to have backfired
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While the IRA ceasefire nudges the British and Irish governments towards
framing a peace settlement for Northern Ireland, politicians in Spain are at
odds over how to deal with Eta, the Basque separatist organisation which to
date has given no sign of ending a campaign of violence that, like Ulster's,
stretches back 25 years.
The row centres on a discreet partial parole policy for selected members of
the 525-strong jail population of Eta members - a terrorist prison count
that bears comparison with that of Northern Ireland. This policy is
sponsored by Mr Juan Alberto Belloch who in May added the responsibilities
of the Interior Ministry to his existing job of justice minister.
An independently-minded magistrate before he joined the socialist government
last year and now considered one of the most influential members of Mr
Felipe Gonzalez's cabinet, Mr Belloch has discovered that dealing with Eta
as a minister is a lot more complicated than passing sentences on the
group's gunmen in a courtroom.
His partial parole policy, which has been fiercely rejected by the
conservative Partido Popular opposition and has had no immediate impact on
Eta's commitment to violence, threatens to derail both his own reputation as
a minister and the Spanish parliament's long-standing bi-partisan approach
to terror-ism.
Mr Belloch seeks with his initiative to hasten the end of Eta by denting the
separatist organisation's 'patriots behind bars' propaganda.
Critics contend that the policy risks allowing Eta to raise its operational
ability by regrouping released gunmen and by attracting new recruits on the
grounds that the government is 'soft' on terrorism.
Known as the Biministrio because of his dual ministerial responsibilities,
Mr Belloch had a second successive day of talks yesterday with opposition
parties in preparation for a formal all-party of meeting this month which
will attempt to re-establish a consensus on counter-terrorism policy.
Mr Belloch faced hostile questioning in parliament a month ago when he
admitted that 14 Eta members, who were not named but are understood to be
serving long sentences on murder counts, had received partial paroles which
allow them out of prison during daytime and at weekends.
The controversy over the disclosure of the policy coincided with an Eta bomb
attack in Madrid that killed one of Spain's key army officers, General
Francisco Veguillas who as director-general of defence policy had played a
key role in the modernisation of Spain's armed forces.
Mr Belloch was accused in parliament of failing to consult the opposition
over his initiative and of breaking a formal understanding that any partial
freedoms for jailed Eta members would only follow a sustained ceasefire by
the separatist organisation. 'The (bi-partisan) agreement was that while Eta
continued to kill, Etarras would go to prison, not leave it,' said the
conservative opposition spokesman, Mr Federico Trillo. The row over the
prison policy continued during August as youths sympathetic to Eta clashed
with security forces during the Basque region's summer fiestas. Earlier this
week, on the peak day for returning holidaymakers, Eta showed its muscle
again when it took a leaf from the IRA's violence manual and bombed railway
tracks linking the cities of Pamplona and Zaragoza.
As one of the chief legal officers in Bilbao, the main city in the Basque
region before he became a minister, Mr Belloch balanced stiff sentences for
Eta gunmen with a close watch on the possible maltreatment of separatist
suspects. He took a particularly strong line in supporting fellow
magistrates investigating a celebrated case concerning police involvement in
a shadowy anti-Eta death squad.
To the minister's acute embarrassment, the initial details of his
controversial partial parole initiative coincided with the extension of
similar partial freedom privileges to two former police officers who in 1991
received 108-year sentences for their part in the anti-Eta death squad. Mr
Belloch knew both men well from his days as a magistrate in Bilbao.
The minister hotly denied that the former policemen had gained a partial
parole in exchange for remaining silent over the government's alleged
involvement in the 'dirty war' against the separatists.
Mr Belloch argued that by extending an olive branch to members of Eta who
had shown good conduct in jail he could drive a wedge between those who
wanted to break with the violence and those who remained hard-core
terrorists.
The storm created over his initiative has now prompted Mr Belloch into
hawkish language. 'While I am minister there will be no relationships, no
negotiations, no dialogue, no taking of any temperatures and no contact of
any kind with the terrorists,' he said after meeting the conservative party
spokesman on security affairs.

FT  02 SEP 94 / CDU proposes an EU top five: Italy, Britain and Spain would
be excluded from centre of Community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and MICHAEL LINDEMANN

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italy, a founder member state of the European Union, as well as Britain and
Spain, would be excluded from the five-nation 'hard core' of a future
flexible Community, according to a top policy document published yesterday
by Germany's Christian Democrats (CDU), the leaders of the country's
coalition government.
Their vision of an EU of 'variable geometry' would be centred on only five
of the original founding members - France and Germany, as well as Belgium,
Luxembourg and the Netherlands.
However, the reformers say their plan does not imply abandoning hopes that
Great Britain will assume its role 'in the heart of Europe', as Mr John
Major, the British prime minister, said in Bonn three years ago. Rather,
they hope that by forcing the pace of European integration, Britain will in
turn be forced to 'clarify its relationship' with the rest of the EU.
The five-nation future core would be expected to co-ordinate ever more
closely not only on monetary policy, in keeping with the plans for economic
and monetary union, but also on fiscal, budgetary, economic and social
policy.
The future structure of an expanding EU, to include not only the
Scandinavian countries, but also the emerging democracies of central Europe,
was spelt out yesterday by Mr Wolfgang Schauble, the parliamentary leader of
the Christian Democrats, and the second most powerful man in Germany's
ruling party after Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
For the first time, they have openly stated their view that Italy can no
longer qualify to be a member of the inner core if the EU inevitably moves
to multiple speeds, or variable geometry. The expressions mean that
different groups of the member states will co-ordinate their policies in
different ways, depending on the subject concerned: some will opt for
monetary union, others for a common foreign and security policy, and yet a
third combination for a common social policy, for example.
'For the formation of European policy this is a period of many crises but
also of many chances,' Mr Schauble said. 'Variable geometry . . . gives us
better chances to complete this process, given the different, sometimes
competing views. We must accept that not every member can accept every step
at the same time.'
Along with the CDU's sister party, the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union
(CSU), Mr Schauble presented a comprehensive five-point programme for the
next phase of radical reform of the EU, intended to reconcile the
conflicting demands of ever closer integration with continuing enlargement
towards eastern Europe.
This includes the overhaul of all the main EU institutions, granting still
more democratic control to the European parliament, while limiting the
authority of the Council of Ministers, in which the governments of the
member states are represented. Apart from the reinforcement of the 'hard
core', it also involves ever closer co-ordination between France and
Germany, 'raising the quality of relations to a new level'.
'Germany and France form the core of the hard core,' the document, called
Reflections on European Policy, says. 'Their special relationship faces a
stiff test because it too is beginning to show signs of differentiation of
interests and perceptions, which might cause them to drift apart.'
It suggests that the two must overcome their differences of opinion on
'fundamental issues of economic policy', including industrial policy and
competition, as well as, by implication, trade protectionism. There must
also be a debate on the long-term objectives of the common agricultural
policy, and on basic features of the future financial system. The other key
points in the plan are the reinforcement of the EU's common foreign and
security policy, and its enlargement to the east.
On foreign and security policy, it stresses the priority needs for a common
policy on stabilising central and eastern Europe, development of relations
with Russia, and a common policy towards the Mediterranean region, including
north Africa. It also singles out development of 'a strategic partnership'
with Turkey.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Militant Serbs want arms ban lifted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US threats to lift the arms embargo against Bosnia's Moslem-led government
have produced an unexpected reaction: the most militant Serbs say they would
welcome the move, while some prominent Moslems view the prospect with alarm.
This paradoxical response reflects the hardline Serbs' confidence that they
could make further gains in the event of an all-out war, and Moslem fears
that their side, albeit growing in strength, is not ready for an escalating
conflict.
President Bill Clinton has told Congress, where the ban on arms sales to
Bosnia is unpopular, that he will formally propose lifting the embargo
unless the Bosnian Serbs accept the current peace plan by October 15.
Militant Bosnian Serbs, who have resisted pressure from their kinsmen in
Belgrade to accept the plan, are confident the US move would force all Serbs
to bury their internal divisions and prosecute the war with renewed
intensity.
President Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's Moslem leader, acknowledged this week
that his side had not yet matched its enemies' firepower.
His remarks reflect growing concern in Sarajevo that, if the embargo is
lifted, Bosnian Serb forces would quickly move to crush the government army
before it could get heavy weapons and learn to use them effectively.
The fighting ability of the Bosnian army has improved since the creation of
a Moslem-Croat federation six months ago, but troops are still organised on
a local basis and are ill-prepared to fight beyond their village or town.
UN officers say that if the embargo is lifted, it could take at least a year
for the Bosnian army to make proper use of what equipment it received. Mr
Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, claimed last week his adversaries
lacked professional officers capable of handling heavy weapons.
General Ratko Mladic, Bosnian Serb commander, has shown little concern about
the arms embargo.' Let them lift it,' he had told the independent daily
Borba. Another Bosnian Serb officer said: 'If they lift the embargo, the UN
would leave and we could fight a real war. We would finish them off
quickly.'
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic yesterday threatened to cut gas, water,
power and food supplies to Moslem and Croat communities unless Belgrade
lifts its economic blockade, Reuter reports.
The Serb regime in Belgrade imposed a trade embargo on Serbia's recalcitrant
kinsmen in Bosnia four weeks ago to punish them for refusing to agree to the
peace plan.

German industrial production in July rose 2.2 per cent from June and 7.5 per
cent against the same month last year, according to preliminary figures
released by the federal statistics office. The office warned, however, the
figure would be revised down by 1.3 percentage points once final data had
been collected, but analysts said the final rate of 0.9 per cent would still
be strong. Final figures for June were revised upwards by 0.8 percentage
point, taking the monthly rise to 1.8 per cent. Figures for June and July -
the two-month period diminishes seasonal factors - show production in
manufacturing industry increased 5.9 per cent against the same period last
year. Overall industrial production rose 5.2 per cent against the two-month
period a year ago, with the largest rises coming in investment goods, up 7.9
per cent, and raw materials and production goods, up 6.2 per cent.
Norway's unemployment rate in August fell to 5.6 per cent of the workforce
compared with 5.8 per cent in July, according to figures released yesterday
by the Norwegian Labour Directorate. The number of jobless in August fell to
118,448 people from 124,347 in July.
The Dutch government said yesterday that wage increases negotiated as part
of collective labour agreements would have risen a modest 0.8 per cent
during the 12 months ending December 1994.

Herri Batasuna, the radical Basque nationalist coalition that supports Eta's
separatist gunmen and has close links with Ireland's Sinn Fein, yesterday
called on the Spanish government to imitate the example of the British
cabinet by recognising the political nature of violence in the Basque
country, writes Tom Burns. 'The logic of the (John) Major government is in
direct contrast to the closed and hostile position of the Spanish government
which, in the words of (interior and justice minister Juan Alberto) Belloch,
has only yesterday rejected all avenues towards an understanding and called,
once more, for repression,' the Basque coalition said in a statement. The
Basques described the developments in Ireland as 'common sense'.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Balladur advocates EU defence white paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union should produce a white paper on defence to define
'precisely' its security interests and how to defend them in conjunction
with Nato, the French prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, proposed
yesterday, writes David Buchan in Paris. Expanding on the vision of a
multi-speed Europe that he unveiled earlier this week, the prime minister
made clear at a meeting with French ambassadors that such a defence white
paper should be prepared by EU governments in contrast to the economic white
paper drafted last year by Mr Jacques Delors' European Commission.
Mr Balladur's proposal seems to stem from disappointment that the defence
white paper which his government produced earlier this year, and which
committed France to maintaining military spending in the 1995-2000 period,
has not evoked any matching commitments or ambitions from France's EU
partners.
At the same meeting, Mr Alain Juppe, the foreign minister, called yesterday
for big changes in EU institutions at the planned 1996 revision of the
Maastricht treaty. 'For France', he said, 'it is a question of a significant
reform, not a simple re-plastering job.' The government's foreign policy
pronouncements are designed to signal France's ambitions for its EU
presidency in the first half of next year. However, they drew a sharp
reaction from President Francois Mitterrand who tartly reminded the prime
minister that the French constitution gives the president the first word in
foreign and defence policy.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Russia clamps down on TV advertising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian government yesterday approved a draft law on advertising
designed to stop the blanket advertising which propelled the now collapsed
MMM financial company into most Russian homes through TV advertising,
gaining it millions of shareholders who now face losses or even ruin.
The draft comes as advertising executives say that Russia's TV advertising
market is becoming rapidly more sophisticated and profitable, and is
steadily acquiring the range of products which provide the staple of western
TV ads.
The draft, still to be passed by the state duma (lower house of the
parliament), bans all advertising from unlicensed companies - as MMM was -
and prohibits any company from advertising more than twice in one hour on TV
or radio. MMM swamped TV programmes with as many as five commercials in an
hour.
The draft legislation also lays down that all advertisements be 'trustworthy
and conscientious'; bans subliminal advertising and all advertising for
alcohol and cigarettes; and calls for the need to protect the young. It also
decrees that commercials 'do not discredit works of art representing
national or universal values'. This is to prevent the satirical or comic use
of art works and historical figures.
Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, called the measure
'timely' and said he had opposed more radical suggestions to cut down by
decree the volume of advertising in newspapers and in the broadcast media.
MMM was far and away the largest advertiser on TV, spending on some
estimates up to Dollars 100m (Pounds 64.5m) annually on pushing its shares
through commercials using the Golubkov family of working class Muscovites.
Mr Bruce MacDonald, head of the BBDO agency in Moscow, said yesterday that
'no other advertiser came close'.
However, a number of western consumer goods companies are now spending
heavily on TV commercials as they seek to buy their places onto the
increasingly choosy Russian market. Mars, the confectionery company which
has established a manufacturing plant in Russia, is thought to be spending
around Dollars 20m on an annualised basis - while western cigarette and
cosmetics companies are spending between Dollars 2m and Dollars 6m each a
year on their products.
The largest Russian advertisers are financial services companies and banks.
Many of these are either establishing their names through rather grandiose
displays linking their enterprises to Russian historical figures or events,
or pushing shares.
Alcohol and tobacco advertising on TV accounts for some 5-8 per cent of the
total, according to Mr MacDonald. Foreign brands of alcohol have proved
particularly popular on the Russian market, with even the vodka sector now
showing a one-third penetration by overseas brands.
However, whole sectors of consumer advertising such as cars, certain kinds
of foods and some kinds of financial services such as mortgages are wholly
or largely absent from the screen. Mr MacDonald said that 'it would be
better if the industry could develop its own code of conduct and police
itself, as in other countries - but frankly it's not yet in a position to do
so'.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Catholic killed in Ulster on first day of IRA ceasefire:
Major 'livid' over prisoner transfer to N Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The first day of the IRA ceasefire in Northern Ireland ended last night with
the killing of a Catholic man in north Belfast and a shooting in another
Catholic area of the city.
The incidents appeared to damage seriously any immediate prospect of
loyalist paramilitaries ending their campaign of violence.
The shootings came as a political row erupted over transfer of four
Republican prisoners from the mainland to jails in Northern Ireland only
hours after the start of the IRA ceasefire.
A 'livid' Mr John Major ordered an urgent inquiry into the decision to move
the prisoners, which threatened to put the high-risk UK-Irish peace
initiative under renewed pressure by undermining efforts to reassure
unionists that no secret deals had been entered into in return for
Wednesday's IRA announcement.
Meanwhile, the prospect of face-to-face meetings by the end of the year
between Sinn Fein and the British government moved closer as London
acknowledged that amplifications during the day by republican leaders showed
they were 'moving in our direction' over the permanency of the IRA
ceasefire.
Police said the man who died last night was a 32-year-old unemployed
labourer. They confirmed that the victim was a Roman Catholic.
In a second incident, a car was fired at in in the Old Park area of north
Belfast, and a person claiming to represent the loyalist terror group, the
Ulster Freedom Fighters, telephoned BBC Radio Belfast to say they had
carried out that shooting.
Downing Street said the decision to transfer the prisoners to Northern
Ireland had been taken by officials without reference to ministers.
But Mr Derek Lewis, director-general of the Prison Service said the decision
to transfer a total of 14 prisoners - including the four moved today - was
made in June by Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary.
He said the timing of the transfers, once the decision had been made, was
the responsibility of the prison service and had been determined by
'practical' considerations.
Among the prisoners transferred was Mr Patrick Magee, who is serving a life
sentence for his involvement in the Brighton bomb which devastated the Grand
Hotel during the Conservative conference in 1984.
The transfer was immediately attacked by Lord Tebbit, the former
Conservative cabinet minister, who was badly injured in the blast. He said
it was either 'an early reward for the IRA or crass political incompetence'.
As the debate continued over whether the IRA had declared a permanent end to
its armed campaign, Downing Street emphasised that the three-month countdown
to talks with the IRA's political wing would not begin until the
organisation's intentions were 'utterly clear'.
But Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, who does not share Downing
Street's caution, said the controversy over the omission of the word
'permanent' from the IRA's ceasefire statement was over.
He used a state-of-the-nation speech to urge all parties to show imagination
and flexibility. Nobody, he said, should diminish the potential of the
ceasefire 'by trying to interpret it as anything other than what it is'.
His comments followed an article by Mr Gerry Adams in The Irish Times in
which the Sinn Fein president said: 'Albert Reynolds, Dick Spring, John Hume
and others have responded positively and correctly to the IRA announcement.'
In a further republican amplification, Mr Martin McGuinness, a member of
Sinn Fein's governing executive, said the organisation was committed to 'a
complete cessation of military operations under all circumstances'.
Meanwhile, in London, Mr Michael Mates, the former Northern Ireland
minister, said he thought the countdown to talks between London and Sinn
Fein should begin at once. 'I would think it is not unreasonable for the 90
days to start now,' he said.
In Washington, there was little tangible evidence that the US was putting
flesh on its promise of support to the peace process.
In the past, US president Bill Clinton has expressed interest in a visit to
Ireland, and there was some preliminary discussion earlier this year of
adding Ireland to his itinerary for one of his two trips to Europe. No plans
yet exist.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Rowland wins fight with Bock to stay as Lonrho joint chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tiny Rowland won a last-minute victory yesterday over Mr Dieter Bock, his
fellow chief executive at Lonrho, who had planned to strip him of his
executive duties.
The German financier, with 18.8 per cent of the shares, had been confident
that the group's 14 directors would remove the 76-year-old Mr Rowland as
joint chief executive after the disclosure that he was costing Lonrho Pounds
5.5m a year in salary, expenses and other charges under his control.
But Lonrho's three non-executive directors were instrumental yesterday in
preventing attempts to remove Mr Rowland. One explained that they feared
such an attempt could turn into a 'damaging confrontation'.
Instead of questioning whether Mr Rowland should continue in his post, the
board issued a statement saying that speculation regarding his role in the
company 'was totally unfounded'.
However, it also made clear that the remuneration committee, set up by Mr
Bock and chaired by Mr Peter Harper, would review expense levels at head
office.
The statement also said the review of all directors' contracts, remuneration
and expenses was part of an 'ongoing process of change within the group'. Mr
Rowland knew he had won an important victory before the start of the meeting
when he told waiting journalists: 'I am too young to retire.'
Mr Bock's supporters were putting a brave face on events, making clear that
the public disclosure of Mr Rowland's expenses had made it harder for him to
remain in his post in the medium term.
Some directors also remain concerned that the company sold a recently
completed film about the Lockerbie bombing to an Egyptian company linked to
Libya, in possible contravention of United Nations sanctions.
But one Lonrho employee questioned Mr Bock's timing in trying to remove Mr
Rowland. Mr Bock is said to believe that his timing was dictated by the
Lockerbie film disclosure.
Mr Rowland's two most prominent allies on the board retire in the autumn: Mr
Rene Leclezio, the chairman, goes at the end of October and Mr Robert
Dunlop, deputy chairman, retires at the end of the month.
With the disagreement between the two chief executives out in the open, some
analysts warned that a question mark over the group's strategy would remain
until it became clear who had won the power battle.
Mr Bock may now have to wait until the end of next year, when he can
exercise a call option on Mr Rowland's remaining 6.5 per cent stake.
He has made no secret of his desire to remove Mr Rowland, who he believes
has been frustrating his attempts to reorganise Lonrho's assets.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Railtrack prepares plan for dismissing strikers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Railtrack is finalising plans to break the deadlock in the 13-week rail
strike by dismissing striking signal workers who refuse to accept new terms
of employment.
The company's chairman, Mr Robert Horton, is thought to favour an option
that could cost Railtrack about Pounds 16.5m in incentives to signal workers
to encourage them to defy their union and go back to work.
The signal workers would be offered a final pay and productivity package
that would raise their basic wage rates by up to 26 per cent and their
overall earnings by 10 per cent. In return, they would have to accept new
working practices to improve efficiency.
Last night, Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT transport union's general secretary,
said he found it 'astonishing that Railtrack would spend up to Pounds 16.5m
on signal workers when they could settle this dispute for a third of that
figure'. He added: 'My message to the signal workers is quite simple - stand
firm, refuse to sign any new contracts.'
While Railtrack said no decision was 'imminent' on new contracts, the union
fears the company will go ahead with its plan next week during the Trades
Union Congress.
After taking legal advice, Railtrack has prepared a detailed timetable for
introducing the new individual contracts for the signal workers.
First, a letter would be sent to the signal workers asking them individually
to accept the revised offer. Eight days later, a second letter would go to
those who still refused to agree, warning that if they went on strike again
they would be summarily dismissed.
After 16 days, if disruptive action continued, all remaining strikers would
be dismissed. They would then be offered re-engagement with a choice of
either accepting the new terms and conditions or returning to work on the
old conditions so as to treat them equally with non-strikers.
Railtrack hopes at that stage there would be large-scale acceptances of the
new conditions and the strike would crumble.
But the company is also preparing to face the prospect that a hardcore of
workers would continue striking. It plans to train new staff to take
signalling jobs but believes this option would depend on how many signal
workers accepted the new terms.
Mr David Armstrong, Railtrack's human resources director, also wrote to Mr
Knapp yesterday warning him that the 'legal deadline' of September 30 to
ensure signal workers secured up to Pounds 50m in pension fund benefits is
fast approaching.
Mr John Monks, the TUC's general-secretary, said yesterday he believed
Railtrack's policy of opening up more of the network on strike days was 'not
working' and he saw no end to the dispute.
'The company is not going anywhere in this strike. I don't see any sign of
this changing.' Mr Monks pointed out that while half the track might be
open, very few signal workers were defying the strike call.

FT  02 SEP 94 / British Gas gets go-ahead to discount prices for industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas was freed yesterday from regulatory restraints which have
allowed its competitors to seize 84 per cent of the Pounds 1.1bn a year
market for large industrial customers.
Ofgas, the industry regulator, decided to suspend the requirement that
British Gas sell to large industrial and commercial customers - those using
25,000 therms a year or more - at its published prices, a rule that did not
allow for any discounting.
The requirement lifted yesterday was imposed in 1989 as part of the
government's efforts to introduce competition into the gas market.
Independent companies, operating with minimal overheads and using British
Gas pipelines, were quickly able to take a large market share by offering
discounts of 10 per cent-20 per cent below British Gas prices.
The suspension of the regulation will run for six months from October 1,
during which time Ofgas will also conduct a regulatory review of the entire
gas contract market above 2,500 therms.
Ofgas said yesterday the suspension was dependent on British Gas's
maintaining a 'non-discriminatory' pricing policy.
It said any evidence that the company was selling gas at 'broadly below
cost', or using predatory pricing to win back market share, might result in
the reimposition of price schedules.
Ofgas held out the prospect that similar restraints on British Gas in other
market segments might be lifted at the end of the review.
Those restrictions may be replaced with a general requirement that the
company should not discriminate in pricing.
Ofgas has ordered British Gas to reduce its share of the contract market
above 2,500 therms a year to 55 per cent by 1995 to encourage competition.
The company has asked for the early lifting of all price restrictions,
saying that its share of the contract market had fallen to 47 per cent.
But Ms Clare Spottiswoode, Ofgas director-general, said the company's
dominant share in other market segments made it 'premature to lift those
schedules at this time'. Many of British Gas's competitors expressed doubts
about the ability of Ofgas to police an unrestricted market.
Mr Norman Ellis, managing director of Kinetica, a joint venture between
PowerGen and the US oil company Conoco, accused Ofgas of being
'short-sighted' in allowing British Gas to compete freely in the commercial
market for guaranteed supplies while the independents were still barred from
competing in the residential market.
He said the move would depress already thin profit margins in the commercial
market and might cause some independents to reconsider their commitment to
the UK gas market.
He added that squeezing the independents 'won't give our shareholders
confidence to make the investment decisions that need to be taken' to
prepare for the phased opening of the domestic market in 1996.
British Gas welcomed the Ofgas decision and said it 'looked forward to the
removal of all other regulatory restraints as soon as possible'.

The FT-SE 100 share index closed 34.8 points down at 3,216.5 as pessimism
about the future direction of interest rates gripped world financial
markets. The gloom was prompted by poor US price data, strong German output

FT  02 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Quarto static despite lacklustre book
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Quarto Group, the publishing and printing services company, saw
sales advance 17 per cent at the interim stage despite a weak UK book
market.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to June 30 rose from Pounds 1.63m to
Pounds 1.67m on turnover ahead to Pounds 22.7m (Pounds 19.5m).
Operating profits improved to Pounds 1.91m (Pounds 1.86m).
Mr Laurence Orbach, chairman, said sales had been affected by a shortfall in
the UK publishing business but, based on current order books, he expected an
improvement in core publishing activities in the second half.
The effect of destocking by leading UK book retailers 'had been profound' in
the first six months but he believed this was temporary.
Turnover in the US, which accounts for 53 per cent of total sales, had been
strong, boosted by a first time contribution from Front Line Art Publishing,
a California-based publisher of art prints and posters, acquired in May.
Earnings per share fell from 6.4p to 4.8p, reflecting extra shares in issue
following the Pounds 9.5m rights issue in September. An unchanged interim
dividend of 2p is declared.

FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: Czech telecom monopoly advances
to Kcs3.49bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPT Telecom, the Czech state telephone monopoly being restructured and
privatised, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Kcs3.49bn (Dollars 124.6m)
for the six months to June on revenues of Kcs10.01bn.
Interim figures for 1993 were not made available, but SPT Telecom made
full-year pre-tax profits of Kcs6bn on revenues of Kcs18.3bn last year. The
company expects full year pre-tax profits for 1994 of Kcs7.4bn.
SPT Telecom is seeking a single strategic partner to buy 27 per cent of the
company by March 1 next year to help modernise its outdated network. Several
international telecoms groups are believed to be interested, with most
speculation centred on France Telecom and AT&amp;T of the US.
Only one in five Czechs has a telephone, and SPT Telecom has a backlog of
more than 500,000 applications for new telephones.
The company's future investment programme calls for spending up to Kcs130bn
on updating equipment and speeding up installations.
Under the government's telecommunications policy, SPT Telecom is to retain a
monopoly of Czech telephone services until the end of the decade.

<TEXT>
Stadshypotek, Sweden's largest mortgage credit institute, yesterday launched
a SKr3bn share issue to convert it from a co-operative organisation into a
profit-orientated listed company.
The offer, one of the biggest de-mutualisation projects carried out in
Sweden, is being made to 760,000 Stadshypotek borrowers who will be allowed
to waive subscription rights in favour of domestic and international
institutions.
Borrowers will be eligible, according to the size of their mortgages, to
subscribe for shares at a price of SKr80 per share. They will also receive
one matching share free for every share they buy from Stadshypotekskassan
(the Urban Mortgage Bank), the trustee fund which currently owns 100 per
cent of Stadshypotek.
The shares are expected to have a pro forma net asset value of about SKr125.
Stadshypotek can also issue a further 4.5m shares at market prices to
Swedish and foreign institutions if the initial offer is a success.
The subscription period for the initial offer starts on September 26.
If fully taken up, the offer to borrowers will leave UMB with a 36.2 stake
in Stadshypotek. Under current legislation, UMB's holding is due to be wound
up by the year 2002.

FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: Telia earnings increase fourfold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Telia, the state-owned Swedish telecommunications group, yesterday announced
a surge in first-half profits to SKr3.4bn (Dollars 441m), nearly four times
the SKr865m achieved last year.
It said full-year earnings would be considerably higher than last year's
SKr3.95bn level even though it antici-pates greater competition and lower
prices in the autumn.
The group said it benefited from improved operating margins, lower capital
costs and the sale of Teli AB to Ericsson.
Operating revenues rose 7 per cent to SKr18.9bn while costs were reduced by
a similar amount to SKr11.09bn. This left the group with operating income of
SKr7.80bn, against SKr5.70bn.
Telia said it had noted a marked increase in the inflow of orders from big
customers in the commerce and service sector.
It added that traffic revenues in the switched telephone network were 2.6
per cent higher than a year ago while the number of subscriptions had begun
to rise again after a decline in 1993. 'Mobile telephony continues to
experience strong growth,' it said.

FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: Financial items boost Skanska
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Skanska, the Swedish construction and property group, yesterday reported a
30 per cent rise in first-half pre-tax profits to SKr1.52bn (Dollars 196m).
The rise came in spite of a weaker Swedish construction market and was
achieved due to lower net interest costs, reduced exchange losses on loans
and increased income from dividends.
Operating profit before financial items was SKr1.32bn, after including a
SKr234m gain on the sale of investment and development properties. The
figure was 7 per cent lower than a year ago when operating profits of
SKr1.43bn included a SKr37m gain from property sales.
The group has already exceeded the SKr1.12bn profit it reported for the
whole of 1993. Its second-half figures will include SKr880m in revenues
following the winding-up of Protorp, the investment company.
Revenues climbed to SKr14.9bn from SKr14bn. However, the group relied on a
strong expansion of its international construction business, where revenues
climbed to SKr3.9bn from SKr2.4bn, to offset the downturn in domestic
construction, where revenues fell to SKr6.7bn from SKr7.4bn.
During the first half the group established a Finnish subsidiary and bought
the Beers Construction group in Atlanta, Georgia, as part of an
international expansion drive. It wants international business to reach
35-40 per cent of group revenues to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in
the Swedish building sector.
Skanska noted that Swedish housing starts had slumped to 3,300 units in the
first half from 5,644 units. It said the extremely low level of residential
activity created 'major difficulties for Swedish contracting operations,'
although there had been a slight improvement in the road and civil
engineering sector.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Castro may go to war, says report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Fidel Castro may opt for war with the US if he is backed into a
corner, said a study prepared for the Pentagon and released yesterday,
Reuter reports from Washington.
The study by Rand, a California research organisation, was completed last
spring and anticipated the anti-government demonstrations and refugee exodus
of recent weeks.
It said Mr Castro was unlikely to accept a forced resignation because it
would tarnish his place in history.
'Castro is not likely to give up power voluntarily; and if cornered he might
fight to the death,' said the report, paid for by the office of Mr William
Perry, defence secretary.
'With his regime at the point of unravelling, Castro might try to engineer a
final military reckoning with the US in a Gotterdammerung-type scenario that
could leave Cuba destroyed but would confirm his legacy as Latin America's
staunchest anti-imperialist,' it said.
Such an outcome, the study insisted, 'conforms not only to the value that
Castro places on struggle, intransigence, and defiance, but also the way he
and past Cuban leaders have exalted the acts of death and martyrdom on
behalf of the nation.' The Cuban leader might seek a clash over the Florida
Straits, which separate Florida and Cuba by 90 miles, or over Guantanamo
Bay, the US naval base on Cuba's southeast shore.
His grip on power remained firm, with the Communist party apparatus,
military and security organs 'largely in the hands of hardline officers',
the report said. Clinton administration officials have said they are not
committed to ousting Mr Castro. Instead, they have tightened a 31-year-old
US trade embargo against Cuba to force him towards meaningful economic and
political reforms.
The Rand report concluded that such reforms were highly unlikely while Mr
Castro remained in power.

FT  01 SEP 94 / US middle class divided by skills, says Reich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The middle class in the US is being divided by its levels of education and
skills, according to Mr Robert Reich, US labour secretary.
In a pre-Labor Day speech on the state of the workforce yesterday, Mr Reich
said: 'The deepest divisions (in US society) aren't based on race or on
national origin or on geography. They're based on the ability of individuals
to make their way in an increasingly turbulent society.'
Mr Reich said that whereas in 1979 a 'middle class' male with a college
degree earned 49 per cent more than one with only a high school diploma, by
1992 the college graduate was earning 83 per cent more.
Unemployment patterns, too, reflect the divergence between the skilled and
the unskilled. The unemployment rate for those who completed a college
education has held steady over the last 15 years at around 3 per cent. The
level for those who did not finish high school, however, has jumped from 7
per cent in the 1970s to 12 per cent last year.
Although Mr Reich said there was much to celebrate in the news that between
last Labor Day and the end of July the economy had added 2.5m new jobs, he
said the middle class had splintered into three groups: an 'underclass'
isolated from the core economy and walled off from hope; an 'overclass' who
profitably rode the changes in the economy; and the bulk of the population,
an 'anxious class. . . pulled and stretched by the need to work two or more
jobs to keep a family solvent, by uneasiness about healthcare, by the
spectre that today's job will disappear tomorrow. . .'
Mr Reich was one of the main intellectual forces behind the Clinton
administration's pledge to reward the work of 'the forgotten middle class'.
The answer to the growing divisions, he says, is education. Expanding
skills, particularly in technology-related fields, in-house training
programmes and keeping potential high-school drop-outs in education longer
all help to build a new middle class, he believes.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Mexican rates rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Interest rates on Mexican short- and long-term government paper rose sharply
yesterday, reflecting concern over the country's political and economic
situation, writes Damian Fraser.
The interest rate on 28-day paper rose by 51 basis points to 14 per cent,
and on one-year paper by 75 points to 13.18 per cent. The rise in interest
rates follows weakness in the peso against the dollar in recent days. Market
analysts attributed the rise to investor nervousness about Mexico after the
election last month and about the incoming government's exchange rate
policy.

FT  01 SEP 94 / North Korea signals move on succession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
North Korea's decision to send a special envoy to China signals an imminent
announcement of a new leader in the Stalinist state, diplomats and analysts
in Seoul said yesterday, Reuter reports from Seoul.
North Korea said on Tuesday it was sending Mr Song Ho-gyong, vice-foreign
minister to China as a special envoy.
'Song will be making the first public and official visit to Beijing by a
senior North Korean official since the death of Kim Il-sung. This appears to
be the completion of reshuffling in North Korea's hierarchy,' an Asian
diplomat said.
'It is an established practice between North Korea and China to notify
important changes in their countries,' he said.
North Korea's former president died of a heart attack on July 8 after he
designated his eldest son, Mr Kim Jong-il, as his successor, but the younger
Kim has yet to be named as the country's communist party chief or state
president.
'It is quite likely that Mr Song will notify leaders in Beijing of
Pyongyang's plan to hold a huge rally soon formally to name Kim Jong-il as
the party leader,' said Mr Ko Tae-woo, chief analyst at the Institute of
North Korean Studies.
'He will probably ask Beijing to take steps to help consolidate Kim
Jong-il's legitimacy,' Mr Ko said.
China is North Korea's last important ally, and its blessing of the
communist world's first dynastic succession is seen as vital to Mr Kim
Jong-il, who lacks his father's charisma.
The Asian diplomat said China's support for Mr Kim Jong-il's leadership was
particularly important as South Korea had built up an important business
partnership with Beijing, diminishing the North's political leverage.
South Korea's trade ministry said two-way trade between Seoul and Beijing
was expected to total Dollars 12bn this year, up from Dollars 9bn in 1993.
Chinese figures put trade with South Korea in the first half of this year at
Dollars 5bn, up 59 per cent on the same 1993 period, while trade with North
Korea fell 21.9 per cent to Dollars 335m.
'As this trade and investment grow North Korea's influence in Beijing wanes,
especially after the death of Kim Il-sung, who knew many of China's veteran
political and military leaders,' a diplomat in Beijing said. Mr Kim Jong-il
has rarely visited China and does not have the good personal relations with
Chinese leaders his father enjoyed.
North Korea watchers in Seoul said that North Korea's elite must have been
preoccupied with the task of restructuring its hierarchy around Mr Kim
Jong-il since the elder Kim's death.
'Now it is beginning to address the importance of its external relations,'
said Mr Lee Seo-hang, a director-general of the government-backed Institute
of Foreign Affairs and National Security in Seoul. 'Song's visit could mark
the first step to seek continuity of its external relations,' he added.
The naming of Mr Kim Jong-il as the new communist party chief could coincide
with celebrations on September 9 or October 10, the anniversary of the
setting up of the ruling party.
He was last seen publicly at a July 20 memorial service for his father.

FT  01 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: NIE in demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While the rest of the electricity sector paused for breath after the
startling post-distribution review, shares in Northern Ireland Electricity
forged ahead to match their all-time high as the market responded to news
that the IRA had declared a cessation of violence in the province from
midnight yesterday.
Analysts focused on the potential benefits to NIE from the ceasefire, which
include a substantial saving on the cost of intensive security at its
installations in the province and expected closer ties with the Republic of
Ireland.
Analysts estimated that the savings on security costs could come out at
Pounds 0.5m and pointed to the good opportunities for NIE to export
electricity to the Republic, which suffers from supply shortages. Other bull
points for NIE included increased US investment in Northern Ireland which,
if involving investment in manufacturing, would flow into NIE's core home
market.
Hoare Govett, the stockbroker, and a long-time bull of NIE, forecast that
NIE's current 3 per cent yield discount would go out to 10 to 15 per cent
and said positive sentiment would drive the NIE share price. The broker's
fair value estimate for NIE is 450p. The stock ended 21 dearer at 419p,
having touched 421p.
Internationally traded stocks with a heavy US presence came under pressure
as a result of a weak Wall Street. SmithKline Beecham attracted
profit-taking following the earlier boost from its acquisition of Sterling
Health. There was also talk that one small US broker was taking a negative
view of the stock but dealers who arbitrage between the US and London said
the main selling came from the UK. The 'A' shares fell 10 1/2 to 455p and
the Units slipped 10 to 411p.
Zeneca moved back 6 to 839p in spite of getting marketing approval in Italy
for one of its products and filing in the UK for approval to sell a cancer
treatment.
Elsewhere, Reed International retreated 10 to 785p as it announced its plans
to take a big stake in computer magazine group Ziff Communications.
Banks performed strongly, with the two Scottish banks the sector's
outstanding stocks. Royal Bank of Scotland was 10 higher at 426p after
further aggressive institutional demand and Bank of Scotland 8 stronger at
208p.
TSB was the most heavily traded bank stock, with the market bracing itself
for a big buy recommendation. The shares climbed 5 1/2 to a two-month high
of 222p.
Schroders raced up 48 to a record 1508p ahead of interims due tomorrow.
Provident Financial was up 18 at 541p in the wake of excellent half-year
numbers.
The day's biggest decline in the Footsie stocks was in aero-engines group
Rolls-Royce as several brokers took profits ahead of today's interim
figures. The shares fell 10 to 188p in trade of 4.9m, with BZW and Credit
Lyonnais Laing among the leading sellers.
Sentiment was further dampened by vague talk in some quarters that the group
would announce provisions for the benefit of its power division.
High street retailer Body Shop bounced 11 to 216p, with Robert Fleming said
to have turned positive.
Kingfisher fell 15 to 539p in reaction to the decision by leading French
banks to raise their interest rates. The move was expected to hit the
group's French subsidiary Darty.
Food retailer Argyll shed 12 to 295p after James Capel advised investors to
sell.
Brewer Bass gained 10 at best before closing 6 ahead at 593p. James Capel
and UBS were both cited as recommending the shares.
The two building sectors included a welter of strong performers. In the
housebuilders, Persimmon advanced 10 to 262p after better than expected
interims.
James Capel was said to have been the driving force behind strong
performances of Blue Circle, 12 higher at 322p, and Redland, 14 firmer at
562p. BZW was responsible for lifting Pilkington 2 1/2 to 197p.
Aran Energy, one of the smaller oil exploration stocks, attracted some
aggressive buying amid rumours of drilling success west of the Shetlands.
The stock moved forward 1 1/2 to 39 1/2 p.

FT  01 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Coats Viyella upset
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sell advice from one of its joint brokers just before interim figures due
next week hit the share price of Coats Viyella, the UK's leading textile
group.
The stock fell quite sharply in early trading as BZW recommended that
clients take profits following a good run in the shares. It remained weak
and closed 10 off at 229p with turnover reaching 3.5m.
Ms Julia Blake, textile analyst with the UK investment bank, said the
rationale was quite simply that: 'The shares were on too much of a premium
to the sector and looked vulnerable. We had the stock on a trading buy at
200p, and 240p was quite a good level to take profits.'
However, there was some confusion as the negative advice came the day before
an expected 70-page BZW review of the sector and five days ahead of interim
figures which are expected to begin a jumpy reporting period. Textile
profits have been badly affected by Continental competition and the
inability to raise prices of goods leaving the factory gate at a time when
raw material costs are creeping up.
William Baird, which reports on September 7, was flat at 234p, while
Courtaulds Textiles, with figures on September 15, eased 3 to 494p.

FT  01 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Defence stocks on alert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Defence and industrial giant British Aerospace advanced sharply as
speculation that it is to merge with defence electronics group GEC returned
to the market.
The talk was fuelled by this week's Dollars 10bn merger between Lockheed and
Martin Marietta, and shares in BAe closed 20 ahead at 504p, having touched
508p earlier in the day, to make it the best performing stock among FT-SE
100 constituents. However, turnover at 2.7m was modest and several analysts
suggested that a merger was unlikely in the near term. Trade in GEC was also
light, totalling a mere 2m. The shares held at 308p.
One market watcher said: 'I find today's move in BAe surprising; after all,
the new merged group in the US is likely to provide stiff comp-etition.'
Some dealers put the day's rise down to straightforward catching up
following recent underperformance. Others pointed to some switching from
Rolls-Royce into BAe. There were also bargain hunters ahead of next week's
Farnborough Air Show.

FT  01 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Worries over inflation following the release of US economic data checked an
advance in stock index futures, although dealers reported a positive tone to
the sector, writes Joel Kibazo.
A firm opening to trading in the September futures contract on the FT-SE 100
at 3,260 encouraged early buying, especially from independent, or local,
traders. Sporadic demand was also seen from some of the leading institutions
in the first half. The contract moved steadily forward and reached a peak
for the session of 3,284 in the late morning.
At this stage the contract was showing a healthy premium to the underlying
cash market and dealers used the opportunity to arbitrage between the two
markets.
Following a bout of inactivity over the lunchtime period, the contract
slipped back after the release of a clutch of US economic indicators, which
brought back some fears on inflation.
September closed at 3,263, unchanged on the day but at a 13-point premium to
cash on turnover of 10,145 lots.
Good activity in the FT-SE 100 option boosted volume in the traded options.
Total turnover at the close stood at 31,697 lots, of which 18,709 were dealt
in the FT-SE 100 option and 1,525 in the Euro FT-SE option.
Pilkington was the busiest stock option with 1,250 contracts transacted.

FT  01 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Recovery halted as inflation worries
resurface - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An attempt to recover from the profit-taking of the previous session was
abandoned yesterday after the latest data on the US economy raised the
spectre of inflationary pressures. But, once again, it was the UK blue chips
which looked uncertain. The broader market held steady and strength in
building shares reflected underlying confidence in the progress of economic
recovery.
At best, the FT-SE 100-share Index was more than 15 points up. The rises in
French bank rates announced after London had closed on Tuesday were
dismissed as purely technical moves, with no serious implications for
today's meeting at the Bundesbank, where most analysts believe German rates
will be left unchanged. A modest fall in the UK Purchasing Managers Index
encouraged hopes for non-inflationary growth, although this index is not yet
taken too seriously by the stock market.
However, gains were quickly whittled away when London caught the hint that
the New York markets would react negatively to the July US leading economic
indicators, which showed a rise in material prices, known to be a sensitive
area at the Federal Reserve; the Chicago Purchasing Managers report seemed
to indicate similar trends. Some commentators revived the word 'stagflation'
coined 20 years ago to describe the combination of rising prices and slowing
economic growth.
The FT-SE 100 Index ran back almost to its overnight level as the big
trading houses sought to reverse their trading positions in a hurry.
However, a late rally left the index at a final reading of 3,251.3 for a
gain of 1.7 points on the day. Trading volume increased in the second half
of the session as arbitraging was reported between stock index futures and
underlying equities. But the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, incorporating a wider
range of second line stocks, remained firm, closing 2.8 higher at 3,816.6.
Several trading programmes were reported, and these increased the pressures
from the stock index futures sector.
Seaq-reported trading volume of 647.9m shares was nearly 8 per cent above
Tuesday's figure, which in turn reflected Pounds 1.22bn in retail worth and
confirmed the return to higher levels of investment activity since the most
recent upswing in the stock market.
A market highlight in terms of share price movement, although not in trading
volume, came in the defence sector, which responded to the Dollars 10bn
merger of Lockheed Corporation and Martin Marietta in the US. Shares in both
British Aerospace and GEC rose smartly as the stock market revived past
hints that GEC might seek closer links with, or bid for, Aerospace. By the
close, GEC shares had given back the gain but Aerospace remained in demand.
On balance, however, the stock market did not sound convinced of its own
hopes for an early bid.
Interest rate-related stocks, including most of the store and retail issues,
made a good recovery from the bout of profit-taking endured in the previous
session, although Kingfisher, the high street trader, suffered from the
implications for Darty, its French retailer, of the rises in bank interest
rates in that country.
Traders said that the underlying tone of the stock market had remained very
firm yesterday. The economic data from the US provided a somewhat
discouraging curtain-raiser for the more significant statistics on US
unemployment and payrolls due on Friday, which are likely to set the pact
for world markets next week.
Today will bring both the meeting of the Bundesbank policy council and also
the wider ranging US purchasing managers survey. Either could have
significant effect on near-term views on the equity market outlook.

FT  01 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Profit-taking emerges as
carmakers weaken
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks succumbed to profit-taking yesterday, as investors regrouped after
a week-long surge in share prices, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally 3.88 easier at 3,913.42, while
the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 softened 0.59 to 475.50. Still, rising issues
outnumbered declines on the Big Board by a four-to-three margin. Heavy
program-guided trading lifted New York SE volume to 357m shares.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was up 1.65 at 454.34,
but the Nasdaq composite closed 0.84 down at 765.62.
On balance, the day's conflicting economic news was neutral for the stock
market. The Commerce Department reported a 2.3 per cent fall in factory
orders, against forecasts of a 2.0 per cent decline.
The slowdown supported the notion that the economy was cooling down enough
to delay the Federal Reserve's move to tighter money. The credibility of
that scenario, which had been responsible for the recent rally, was
reinforced by the monthly survey of Purchasing Management Association of
Chicago. The trade group said its August index of business activity receded
from the previous month's level.
However, the prices-paid component of the Chicago report showed a jump,
unsettling the inflation-sensitive bond market during the morning.
Although Treasury prices later recovered, equity investors could not get
back on track after running up the value of Dow industrials by 4.5 per cent
over the previous six sessions.
But the profit-taking remained light. General Motors, off Dollars 1 3/4 at
Dollars 50 1/4 , showed the biggest drop among the 30 Dow components. Some
of GM's weakness was linked to renewed concern over Chrysler's future
performance. Shares in the third-largest US car maker fell Dollars 1 1/4 to
Dollars 48 1/8 on reports that company insiders had sold stock valued at
Dollars 7m in late July. Ford shed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 29 1/4 .
Semiconductor shares were the session's hardest hit sector. Texas
Instruments tumbled Dollars 4 5/8 to Dollars 77 7/8 after SoundView
Financial Group downgraded the issue. Earlier, a Japanese court rejected the
company's claim of patent infringement by Fujitsu. Micron Technology, which
was also knocked off SoundView's 'buy' list, lost Dollars 3 1/4 at Dollars
40 1/4 .
NorAm Energy, a leading gas utility and pipeline operator, surged ahead 21
per cent to Dollars 7 1/4 . The net gain of Dollars 1 1/4 came in a response
after a federal court in Houston threw out a long-standing lawsuit against
the company.
In the pharmaceuticals sector, which has come to life amid a flurry of high
profile acquisitions, Warner-Lambert gave back Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 83
5/8 . During the previous session the stock bounded Dollars 5 5/8 higher on
takeover speculation.
On the positive side, Philip Morris strengthened Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 61
in trade of 8.7m shares on its announcement of a dividend increase and an
ambitious stock buy-back programme.
It was a relatively quiet day on the Nasdaq after eight straight sessions on
the upswing. But Castle Energy jumped Dollars 3 1/2 , or 25 per cent, to
Dollars 17 5/8 , its highest level in the past 52 weeks. The company settled
a contractual dispute with Metallgesellschaft, the German group.
Canada
Toronto closed higher after moderate trading, extending its rise to four
sessions. The TSE 300 index added 15.79 at 4,349.50 and advances led falls
by 410 to 327. Volume came to 69.2m shares. Twelve of the 14 sub-indices
rose, led by golds, up 1.7 per cent.
Seagram, CDollars  1/2 firmer at CDollars 44 3/8 , reported better than
expected second-quarter earnings and a quarterly dividend lifted to 15 cents
from 14 cents.
Mexico
Equities lost ground for a fifth consecutive session, leaving the market's
principal index below its level prior to the August 21 presidential
elections for the first time. The IPC index slipped 30.11, or 1.1 per cent,
to 2,702.73.
Another surprising rise in bellwether Treasury bill rates and post-election
fears of a renewal of troubles by the revolutionary faction in the southern
state of Chiapas conspired to drive the sell-off.
At the Bank of Mexico's weekly auction, rates for 28-day Cetes, or Treasury
Bills, rose 51 basis points to 14 per cent - more disappointment for a
market expecting a sharp post-electoral drop in rates.

FT  01 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris volatile after rises in
lending rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses took little interest in today's Bundesbank meeting, with 19 of 20
European economists telling Reuter that there would be no change in German
key interest rates today, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS was volatile, the CAC 40 index hitting an early low of 2,038.44 after
Wednesday's post-bourse rises in French banks' base lending rates; in the
end, the key index managed to shrug off a drop in bond futures and closed
8.71 to the good at 2,069.08.
Turnover rose from FFr1.96bn to FFr3.5bn. Alcatel, already depressed by
recurring allegations of over-billing, fell FFr6 to FFr599 on an item in the
Canard Enchaine weekly which covered similar ground. Once again, the company
denied the allegations.
AGF, the insurance company, produced lower first-half profits as expected
and, again as predicted, forecast higher profits for the year. The shares
fell FFr2.20 to FFr228.10. But some financials benefited from the rise in
bank base rates, Societe Generale putting on FFr7 at FFr582 and BNP FFr3.40
at FFr250.50.
FRANKFURT saw corporate influences in the morning, and derivatives pressure
in the afternoon as the Dax rose 2.00 to 2,212.85 on the session, and
subsided to 2,207.09 at the post-bourse close. Turnover rose from DM7.6bn to
DM8.3bn.
On the session, a DM9.70 rise to DM837.50 in Daimler, which reported
US-style net profits of DM369m for the first half against a comparable loss
of DM949m, was offset by general weakness in the automotive sector and, in
particular, a DM6.50 fall to DM498.50 at Volkswagen.
Rumours of a VW rights issue were denied by the company but a fall of DM6.50
to DM498.50 on the session was extended after hours, leaving the stock at
DM493.20. Brokers said a fall in the Dax future brought share prices down in
the afternoon.
ZURICH saw further strong demand for banking and insurance stocks lift the
SMI index 9.9 to 2,645.6, and above the 2,640 resistance level.
Among the recently underperforming banks, UBS bearers rose SFr7 to SFr1,174
and CS Holding by SFr8 to SFr552. SBC gained SFr1 at SFr380 on its plan to
buy Brinson, a US asset manager, for the equivalent of Dollars 750m, which
will be paid over seven years, and some of it in SBC shares.
Ciba bearers dropped SFr18, or 2.2 per cent, to SFr808 in response to its
flat first-half results, which were hit by turbulent financial markets
earlier in the year and the strength of the franc.
Roche certificates picked up SFr130 to SFr6,100, with US and British
investors said to be switching from Ciba. Sandoz, which reports interim
figures today, saw its bearers advance SFr8 to SFr730.
MILAN's early attempts at a rally ran out of steam as a 5 per cent fall in
Olivetti soured the mood. The Comit index finished 1.71 higher at 690.53 in
very thin trade.
Olivetti fell L112 to L2,123 and its industrial holding company, Cir,
finished L82, or 3.6 per cent, down at L2,219.
Mr Andrew Haskins at James Capel noted that the fall came after some weeks
of volatility in the Olivetti price.
He said three factors had weighed on the shares. Most relevant were worries
about possible provisioning against currency losses and losses on bond
holdings.
The sale by DEC, of the US, of its 8 per cent stake had also prompted some
concern, and there
was also the spectre of a renewed round of price-cutting in the pc markets;
but Mr Haskins noted that Olivetti's market share had already grown and
lower prices were likely to lead to a larger global market.
AMSTERDAM was depressed by an unexpected downturn in first-half net profits
at Bolswessanen, the drinks group.
The AEX index fell 1.56 to 419.44 as Bolswessanen dropped Fl 4.10, or 10 per
cent, to Fl 36.90. The group announced an 8 per cent decline in net profits,
compared with expectations of a rise, and analysts downgraded full-year
forecasts.
Among publishers continuing to benefit from a switch to defensive stocks,
Wolters Kluwer rose a further 80 cents to Fl 122.10, and VNU was 90 cents
higher at Fl 186.40 ahead of its six-month figures which came after the
market closed. In the event, the group's 32 per cent profits rise proved to
be at the lower end of expectations.
MADRID stayed in the doldrums, turnover falling from Pta15.7bn to Pta13.3bn
as the general index closed 1.16 lower at 312.02. Brokers blamed the weaker
dollar and losses in the debt markets as a result of higher French rates.
Fans of Acerinox, the stainless steels producer, were consoled by a 58 per
cent rise in profits and a share price Pta280 higher at Pta15,530.
ISTANBUL lost nearly 4 per cent, the composite index ending 1,039.12 off at
25,282.43, with many investors sidelined by money market fluctuations.
WARSAW fell 4.4 per cent in light volume, with buying discouraged by
negative technical signals, the Wig index closing 517.4 down at 11,181.4 as
turnover dropped by 20 per cent to 622.0bn zlotys.

<TEXT>
Reports of the development of an advanced plastic optical fibre prompted
investor interest in telecommunications companies and optical fibre makers,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average closed 36.41 up at the day's high of 20,628.53 on
index-linked buying and purchases by some domestic institutions. The index
fell to a low of 20,533.51 in the morning, but it was supported in the
afternoon by small-lot buying on reports of the optical fibre development,
and of a consortium of 45 companies planning to commercialise it.
Volume totalled 264m shares, against 181.2m. Some investors bought telecom
stocks ahead of Japan Telecom's listing next Tuesday. The Topix index of all
first section shares edged ahead 3.02 to 1,640.39 and the Nikkei 300 gained
1.09 at 299.25, but declines led rises by 519 to 389, with 224 issues
unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.80 to 1,338.66.
Mitsubishi Rayon, the day's most active issue, advanced Y47, or 11 per cent,
to Y472. As the leading plastic fibre manufacturer, it will be participating
in the consortium. Brokers and investors piled into the stock, which did not
trade during the morning due to a lack of sellers. Other beneficiaries
included NEC, ahead Y20 at Y1,220, Fujitsu, up Y10 at Y1,090, and Sumitomo
Electric Industries, a leading telecom cable company, which firmed Y10 to
Y1,500.
Other telecommunication stocks were actively traded. Nitsuko climbed Y40 to
Y1,620 and NTT moved ahead Y13,000 to Y912,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average receded 20.56 to 22,852.05 in volume of 43.5m
shares.
Roundup
The bullish trend in New York was echoed and, in some cases, amplified.
Kuala Lumpur was closed for Malaysia's National Day holiday.
HONG KONG's Hang Seng index finished above 9,900 for the first time since
mid-March, rising 242.83, or 2.5 per cent, to 9,929.39. Turnover climbed
again, from HKDollars 5.19bn to HKDollars 6.50bn.
Brokers said the visit to Beijing by US commerce secretary Mr Ron Brown
rekindled American investors' interest in Hong Kong as well as in China.
Jardine Matheson surged HKDollars 4.75 to HKDollars 72.75 and Jardine
Strategic advanced HKDollars 2.90 to HKDollars 32. They had lagged behind
the recent market rise, and news that share trading of the companies will
shift to Singapore from January 3 after delisting from Hong Kong boosted
interest.
BOMBAY hit an all-time high, the BSE 30-share index adding 62.91 at 4,588.16
on good company results and a normal monsoon.
Brokers said this bull market had more virtues than its predecessor which
peaked over two years ago; the latter, they added, was fuelled by money
which came from the inter-bank securities market and led to the country's
worst ever, Dollars 1.28bn financial scandal.
The scandal involved brokers and bankers who colluded to divert money from
the securities market to the then booming Bombay bourse. Share prices
crashed after the scandal was exposed in April 1992.
BANGKOK posted its fourth consecutive gain on foreign buying of banking and
communications blue chips, and on active speculative trade. The SET index
closed 32.30, or 2.2 per cent, higher at 1,524.83.
Turnover increased from Bt14.2bn to Bt18.6bn. Banks rose 3.3 per cent in
Bt5bn of turnover, and communications by 4.3 per cent in Bt2.7bn.
SYDNEY's golds gained 1.4 per cent as the All Ordinaries index put on 5.6 at
2,122.1. The Perth-based Orbital Engine jumped 19 cents, or nearly 11 per
cent, to ADollars 1.94 on its development of a cheap fuel injection system
for motorcycle engines, claimed to cut pollution by 95 per cent and boost
fuel efficiency by 45 per cent.
WELLINGTON was lifted by well received results from Fletcher Challenge,
which appreciated 13 cents to NZDollars 4.18, a 1994 high for the industrial
conglomerate. The NZSE-40 index moved up 15.67 to 2,148.48.
KARACHI remained under pressure due to political uncertainty, the KSE 100
index falling 34.56 to 2,186.90.

FT  01 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Easier bullion price hits S African
golds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold and mining-related stocks closed slightly lower as the bullion price
softened, while industrials were flat, with a stronger financial rand
tending to cap activity.
Industrials also continued to be depressed by fears about government
spending and an upward trend in inflation, in spite of reassuring comments
by President Nelson Mandela.
Golds eased 9 to 2,288, the overall index lost 11 at 5,833 and industrials
dipped 4 to 6,535.
De Beers fell R1.50 to R103 and Anglos receded R1 to R259.
Midwits went against the easier trend in golds, moving forward R1.50 to R15,
while Loraine shed 50 cents to R21.25 and Kloof dipped 25 cents to R67.
Randcoal ended unchanged at R24 after news that it would merge with
Trans-Natal.

Politics continued to dominate the Brazilian market last week as the latest
opinion polls suggested that Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso could win in the
first round of the general election on October 3. At the same time, steady
inflows of foreign cash continued to bolster the local currency, which has
appreciated against the US dollar by 11 per cent since the reais was
introduced on July 1.
Mr Anthony Parker at Baring Securities commented that experience showed that
successful investors traditionally sold when the market looked expensive and
bought when it looked cheap, but the country could now be at a watershed and
have a reforming president for the next four years, or even longer.
'This could mean that investors will continue to buy,' he said. 'We think
the market could comfortably go up by another 15 per cent before investors
become worried about the multiple. Much higher than that, and you would be
in a rarified atmosphere.'

FT  01 SEP 94 / Markets Report: Lira recovery continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The lira yesterday continued its gradual recovery on the currency markets to
again reach the L1,000 level to the D-Mark, writes Philip Gawith.
A combination of encouraging events - most recently, a favourable floating
rate bond auction - helped the lira to a London close of L1,000, from L1,007
on Tuesday.
Elsewhere in Europe, the D-Mark's performance was fairly mixed, as it failed
to benefit from the upward trend in French interest rates. The franc was
barely changed at FFr3.422 against the D-Mark from FFr3.423.
The announcement that the Irish Republican Army was suspending military
operations after 25 years had little discernible impact on the pound. The
trade weighted sterling index finished at 79.1 after opening at 78.8.
Market talk about progress in the US-Japan trade talks helped the dollar
finish firmer against the yen at Y100.175, from Y99.665. It ended slightly
lower against the D-Mark at DM1.5783 from DM1.5805. In New York it edged up
to a closing Y100.185 and DM1.5817.
Overall activity was quiet, with most traders focusing on today's Bundesbank
council meeting, and the release tomorrow of the monthly US employment
report.
The firmer lira was one of a number of currencies which defied those who
thought higher rates in France would favour the D-Mark. Mr Adrian Schmidt,
international economist at Chase Manhattan, said there were three factors
which explained the lira's recent recovery from a low of L1,030 on August
12.
These were the firmer tone to the dollar, improved expectations of a
credible budget package - based primarily on government plans to implement a
pensions reform package - and the good response to Tuesday's auction.
While the recent absence of political tensions has clearly helped the lira,
most observers believe that the market will continue to place a risk premium
on it, until there is evidence of sustained calm on the political front.
Analysts were split as to whether the decision by leading French commercial
banks to raise rates presaged a bottom in European rates, or not.
Mr Brian Durrant, economist at broker GNI, said the rates increase did 'not
have Bank of France official policy implications and certainly does not
imply conclusively that the European interest rate cycle has bottomed'.
But Mr Robert Thomas, head of research at NatWest Markets, said the move,
aimed at bolstering lending margins, 'surely underlines that there is not
much more to go in European rates, if at all'. He added that it was most
unlikely that the banks had not spoken to the Bank of France first, and
their action in then raising rates suggested they were not confident about
the prospect of a further fall in rates.
Various theories circulated about why the banks lifted rates. One is that
they were trying to pressurise the Bank of France to hasten rate cuts.
Another suggested they were acting pre-emptively in anticipation of the
Bundesbank raising rates at its meeting today.
The latter view is certainly a minority one. A Reuters poll of 20 European
economists, ahead of the council meeting, found that only five of those
polled thought the discount rate would not be cut again, and none are
predicting it to be above the current level of 4.5 per cent at the end of
the year. The consensus is that it will be at 4.25 per cent.
Economists at SG Warburg argued, in their latest foreign exchange review,
that 'the Bundesbank lacks economic justification for further monetary
relaxation'. This is based on the view that inflation is approaching a
cyclical bottom.
'They will also have to facilitate substantial issuance throughout potential
political uncertainty in the coming months, a scenario which rules out
measures that may leave the D-Mark and Bundesbank credibility at risk.'
If the Bundesbank does opt for change, it is most likely to revert to a
variable rate repo. The repo rate is currently fixed at 4.85 per cent.
Earlier this week, a Bundesbank council member said the bank had an interest
in keeping alive interest rate speculation.
Analysts were reluctant to predict whether the IRA announcement might
benefit sterling. One line of reasoning was that the pound would firm if
Prime Minister John Major's reputation was seen obviously to have been
enhanced by the ceasefire declaration.
Sceptics, however, said he might well have opened a Pandora's box, fostering
political division among his own supporters. In the medium term, analysts
surmised that the fiscal implications of a unified Ireland would probably
have more impact on the Irish punt, than on sterling.
The August purchasing managers report conveyed little fresh information
about the economy and was ignored by sterling. It also had little impact on
the futures market, with the December short sterling contract closing at
93.40, from 93.43.
The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 194m assistance
after forecasting a daily shortage of Pounds 300m.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Survey of Kansai (9): Developers at bay - Kyoto is 1,200
years old, yet celebrations are muted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kyoto, Japan's historical and cultural capital, began the year of
celebrations commemorating the founding of the city 1,200 years ago, with
fireworks and high-tech laserbeam shows.
But the birthday party has yet to pick up, because the occasion falls at a
time when the city is still suffering the effects of the burst of the asset
'bubble' of the late 1980s and the economic downturn that has followed.
The dramatic rise in property prices and the subsequent fall has hit the
city's development activity. During the late 1980s, the increase in
development in a city surrounded on three sides by mountains, so that
available land is limited, sent real estate prices surging.
Land and condominium prices tripled between 1987 and the peak in 1991, far
exceeding the increases in larger cities such as Tokyo and Osaka. But as
interest rates have risen and speculative activity has diminished, prices
have declined more sharply than in other large cities, falling by half in
the past two years.
The strong yen has also hurt Kyoto's export-oriented companies. Earnings
have plunged at manufacturers such as Nintendo, the video-game maker, and at
high-technology companies Kyocera and Shimadzu.
The economic slump has depressed anniversary festivities, as organisers have
failed to collect the full Y30bn (Dollars 300m) needed for the planned
events from local government and companies.
Yet the economic downturn and the fall in development projects has come as a
relief to many conservationists. They claim that enough damage has been done
to the city, and that further development would only harm Kyoto. The city of
temples and gardens remains the spiritual home for many Japanese, although
traditional wooden houses in the centre have been replaced by investment
houses and offices, and temples and shrines share the skyline with
condominiums and department stores.
'The Japanese are trying to ruin even what the Americans (in the war) chose
to preserve,' says Mr Chikou Kiyotaki, high priest of Koryuji Temple, the
city's oldest.
Many Buddhist temples have been hardened by their experience during the late
1980s, and are relieved at the current economic downturn. In 1990, Kiyomizu
Temple, the most visited in Kyoto at the foot of the eastern hills, was
forced to buy adjacent land to fend off developers trying to construct a
condominium.
Along with the Buddhist community, conservationist citizens groups have
tried to stop developments. Mr Akira Nakajima, leader of a citizens group
against the development of Kyoto, argues that the 'hollowing out' of the
city stems from the rise in property prices, due to the bubble and not the
lack of development.
On the other hand, many of Kyoto's leading businessmen believe a remedy for
the faltering economy is a loosening of development restrictions. They claim
that excessive conservation, aimed at preserving the city's skyline and its
image as Japan's ancient capital, is restraining Kyoto's vitality.
Some of the businessmen who favour further development go so far as to claim
that the city - which was spared US bombing after American academics had
persuaded the airforce not to attack Kyoto and destroy its temples and
shrines during the war - would have prospered had it suffered as Tokyo did,
and therefore been freed from construction restrictions.
'Kyoto is a dead city,' says Mr Katsuji Tsunoda, at the Real Estate Research
Institute, a private agency that monitors property markets.
Members of the development camp blame a recent population drain on building
restrictions that have obliged residents to sell their cramped homes and
move outside the city. Universities have also left Kyoto, because of rigid
height restrictions.
City officials, also disturbed by the fall in economic activity, have not
missed the opportunity to use the 1200th anniversary to request funds from
central government and to change stringent rules covering development
projects. They recently announced a compromise plan, tightening building
rules around historic sites, but easing height restrictions in the southern
industrial areas.
Following the rule changes, rebuilding has begun at Kyoto railway station,
located in the south of the city, to include a concrete and glass monument,
400 metres wide and 58m high, in commemoration of the anniversary.
The business community hopes the project will help to vitalise the regional
economy. They hope the building, which will house a large shopping centre
complex and a hotel, will bring young consumers of the Kansai area to Kyoto;
while an express railway line, linking the new Kansai airport to Kyoto,
which does not have a city airport, will give visitors and cargo easier
access.
Many conservationists, however, fear that economic recovery will mean more
development and further urbanisation.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Survey of Kansai (10): Imperial and tranquil - William
Dawkins offers suggestions to tourists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chances are that most foreign tourists in Kansai will be business
travellers, and will therefore need to be selective.
The yen's inexorable rise makes a Japanese holiday prohibitively expensive
for most foreign travellers, and for an increasing number of Japanese
tourists too. For business tourists, inevitably short of time, the secret of
getting the most out of Kansai is not to try to see too much at once.
The most popular tourist spot in the region - and in the whole of provincial
Japan, for that matter - is of course the former imperial capital, Kyoto,
blessed with more than 1,000 Buddhist temples and 400 Shinto shrines.
It received just over 38m visitors last year - 25 times its own population -
of which less than 1.5 per cent were foreigners, mainly from North America,
South Korea and Taiwan, according to the city's tourist office. The
recession has ensured that numbers overall are down by about 15 per cent
this year, despite the multiple series of festivals, concerts and
exhibitions laid on for Kyoto's 1,200th anniversary.
Mr Teiichi Aramaki, governor of Kyoto prefecture, is using the anniversary
as an excuse to lean on central government for cash and planning permission
to modernise the city's infrastructure. 'We were lucky not to have been
bombed in the war, but this means we have to revitalise earlier than many
other cities. Kyoto today is trying to regain its vitality,' he says.
Not that Kyoto lacks vitality in its present condition. Crowds can be
expected at most of the main sites, in and out of season. For most visitors,
the first port of call is the the Kiyomizu Temple, propped on massive wooden
pillars on a hillside, commanding a splendid view of the city.
The next essential is the golden pavilion, a modern replica of the
five-century old original, burned down in 1950. Nearby is Ryoanji temple,
with its Zen Buddhist rock-and-gravel garden, which most foreigners and not
a few Japanese find an aesthetic puzzle.
If you have any energy left, visit Nijo castle, former residence of the
all-powerful Tokugawa Shoguns, who held Japan under despotic rule for two
and a half centuries, while puppet emperors lived in splendid confinement
just down the road. The Shoguns, never sure from where the next traitor
would spring, installed at Nijo what must be one of the world's earliest
burglar alarms, floorboards designed to betray intruders by squeaking at
every step.
The real pleasure in visiting Kyoto, however, is being able to find your way
off the beaten track. It would be a waste of an opportunity to stay in one
of the many bland western-style hotels in the city centre, one of which
recently annoyed the local monks by flouting a little-observed planning
regulation against new buildings more than 40 metres tall.
For visitors who want a flavour of traditional Japan, I recommend one of the
old-style tatami room inns in the Higashimaya hills on the outskirts of
Kyoto. The best of them have an atmosphere of courtly tranquillity. This is
true of Yachiyo*, where I stayed, and which also happens to be three
minutes' walk from the delightful Nanzenji temple.
If you are lucky enough to have a second day's sightseeing, I suggest a
visit to Nara, a short train ride from Kyoto. This was Japan's first
imperial capital, before the emperor switched to Kyoto 1,200 years ago after
a row with Nara's Buddhist monks.
Parkland, stocked with hundreds of tame red deer, occupies about half of
central Nara. Most of the main sites are situated in pleasant shady glades,
from which traffic is banned. Some people - I am one of them - prefer green
uncrowded Nara to Kyoto's urban bustle.
It was here that Buddhism first flourished in Japan after being imported
from China, from the sixth century. Fortunately Buddhism's most splendid
early Japanese traces are still intact, and they are all here.
The grandest of these is the eighth century Great Image of Buddha, said to
be one of the largest bronze sculptures in the world. It is housed in the
Todaiji Temple, claimed to be the world's largest wooden building, even
after being burned down and rebuilt, at two-thirds of its original size, in
the late 17th century. Most of Japan's ancient buildings are made of wood,
so the fate of Todaiji temple, and Kyoto's golden pavilion is all too
common.
Turn left out of Todaiji's main entrance, and wander up stone steps into the
wooded hills, which conceal a whole complex of lesser-known temples,
repositories for some of Japan's finest religious art. I recommend two for
special attention. The Nigatsu-do Hall, reached by a covered stairway,
offers a magnificent view of Todaiji's monumental roof. Next to it is the
Sangatsu-do Hall, which contains a remarkable collection of early Chinese
sculptures of Buddhist deities. They are poorly lit, so take time to let
your eyes get used to the gloom.
For accommodation, I can suggest Nara Hotel*, a half-timbered 19th

FT  01 SEP 94 / Survey of Kansai (6): Feeling the price-squeeze - Osaka's
small businesses are under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The hidden strength of Osaka's economy, its army of subcontractors, is
coming under unprecedented pressure.
The presence of some of Japan's largest manufacturing companies in the
prefecture, like Matsushita and Sharp, has supported an enormous network of
suppliers, so that small businesses make up a larger than average share of
Osaka's economy.
More than 90 per cent of the local workforce is employed in companies of
less than 300 staff. They produce 65.5 per cent of the region's industrial
turnover, well above the 54.2 per cent for small businesses in the Tokyo
region, according to the Osaka prefectural institute for advanced industry
development.
As in the rest of Japan, the leading manufacturers have squeezed their
suppliers' prices hard during the recession, as part of their cost-cutting
strategies. This has been intense enough to drive some of the weaker
suppliers out of business. At the start of Japan's recession in 1991,
bankruptcies in Osaka grew faster than the number of new businesses for the
first time. The sad trend has continued, says Mr Moriyuki Tsuda, director of
industrial research at Osaka prefecture.
A tour of local subcontractors suggests that prices are still under
pressure, despite signs of an economic upturn, as the latest rise in the
yen's value intensifies the pressure on export-dependent businesses to trim
their costs. Suppliers of the big electronics companies are an example, says
Mr Tsuda.
The big manufacturers are understandably reluctant to push too many of their
suppliers too hard, partly because of traditional loyalties, but also
because Osaka, like the rest of Japan, faces a labour shortage over the long
term.
A classic example of pressures on Osaka's subcontractors is Takizawa
Precision Gear, a tiny producer of machine gears, which has determinedly
kept on its 14 staff throughout the recession.
Mr Kiyoshi Takizawa, its president, whose father founded the business in
1950, devotes 40 per cent of annual sales to his top three customers. The
exposure is big enough to make it impossible for the company to resist their
demands for price cuts of between 5 per cent and 15 per cent every year for
the past four years.
Sales have shrunk from Y300m to Y200m over the same period, perilously close
to Takizawa's Y180m break-even point. Instead of sacking his tiny workforce,
Mr Takizawa has increased spending on training, borrowed Y50m to re-equip
with Swiss machine tools and carried out an engineering cost analysis. He
took on two new employees last April, because he says the business will lose
its edge if he does not rejuvenate the workforce.
Mr Takizawa's strategy of investing through a recession was typical of
Japanese industry in the 1980s, but has been widely abandoned by most of its
largest customers in the recent downturn. He justifies sticking to the old
invest-or-die approach on the grounds that Takizawa has few foreign
competitors, operating with the advantage of cheaper local currencies. This
allows him to market more on quality than on price. But Mr Takizawa admits
that 'there is nothing we can do' if the Japanese market continues to
shrink.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Survey of Kansai (8): No business like funny business -
Conserving a culture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few Japanese people would consider a sense of humour to be a national
characteristic. But in Kansai, cracking jokes is a way of life.
'When they are late for an appointment, Osaka folk will often greet their
companion with a joke instead of apologising for their tardiness,' observes
Mr Kenji Miyashita, editor of the Kansai edition of PIA, a popular weekly
magazine on city trends and events.
This instinctive humour has given rise to a strain of comedy that is
distinctly Kansai, and which is exemplified in Yoshimoto Kogyo, one of the
most successful entertainment companies in Japan. Amid one of the country's
gloomiest post-war periods, Yoshimoto has been doing a roaring trade selling
Kansai laughter. The company owns three theatres in Osaka, and earlier this
year opened another in the classy Ginza district of Tokyo.
Yoshimoto's influence and the appeal of Kansai humour have been such that,
to many Japanese people, comedy fails unless it is performed in the Kansai
dialect.
'It is not surprising that Yoshimoto has been such a success,' says Mr
Tatsuya Terasawa, a civil servant living in Tokyo, who comes from Osaka.
'Everyone in Osaka is like a Yoshimoto comedian. It is no wonder that the
better among them should be considered especially good anywhere else.'
The cult, according to those who have lived there, begins early in life for
Kansai folk. Unlike Tokyo, where schoolboys aspire to achieve high marks or
win sports medals, popularity in the Osaka classroom depends less on
intelligence or athleticism than on how funny you are.
The propensity of Kansai people to look for the funny side of things stems
from a merchant culture which fostered the knack of spotting the unadorned
truth beneath the respectable show that most people, especially Tokyoites,
tend to put on.
'Kansai humour stems from the gap between tatemae, or human behaviour that
follows the social rules, and honne, or their true thoughts and feelings,'
explains Mr Masashi Noyama, manager of corporate information at Yoshimoto
Kogyo.
There is also a happy-go-lucky attitude among Osaka people that contrasts
sharply with the seriousness with which Japanese society takes most things
in life, and adds to Kansai humour.
For example, if a cheque bounces, the Osaka businessman might call his
lawyer and say, 'something terrible has happened,' as if it had happened to
someone else, points out Mr Noyama. The contrast between the seriousness of
the event and the easy-going attitude is what makes the situation funny, he
explains.
Yet, while Kansai humour is today widely appreciated throughout Japan, Mr
Noyama and others worry that the distinctiveness of the region's culture is
being lost behind the uniformity of an increasingly influential mass media.
Like many other things which originated in the Kansai region, local
musicians, designers and performers tend to move to Tokyo once they become
successful, observes Mr Miyashita, at PIA. There used to be an Osaka blues
and soul culture in the 1970s, but that has more or less disappeared; while
Kansai theatre performers, including comedians, move to Tokyo in order to go
into television.
Concern that Kansai is being drained of talent has prompted the Osaka city
government to encourage theatre companies to use public facilities for
performances.
The Osaka chamber of commerce aims to encourage the study of Osaka as a city
by promoting plays that use it as a setting, gift ideas that improve the
city's image, and music compact discs by, for example, the Osaka
Philharmonic Orchestra.
Others, such as Mr Noyama, hope that, with the spread of the information
superhighway, talented performers will no longer have to move to Tokyo.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Survey of Kansai (7): Consolidation is the likely cure -
Pharmaceuticals in crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Along the narrow bicycle-lined street of Dosho-machi, in the Chuo-ku
district of Osaka, are located some of Japan's biggest drugs companies. By
western standards, the headquarters are modest, lacking in ostentation. That
is partly Japanese corporate style, but more significantly it reflects the
failure of these companies, and their Tokyo counterparts, to compete on a
global basis.
Japanese drugs groups' sales growth is slowing; pre-tax profits for many
companies are forecast to decline; and their strength by comparison with
their western counterparts continues to deteriorate.
The industry needs to restructure. Companies do not have sufficient sales to
finance the R&amp;D essential to ensure long-term survival.
When the industry does eventually rationalise, the process will probably
involve a consolidation of drugs companies into larger groups, with those in
Tokyo merging with their local counterparts, and those Osaka-based
businesses in Kansai linking up with their neighbours.
Those located in Osaka include Takeda, Shionogi and Fujisawa. These are
among the largest drugs groups in Japan. Indeed, Takeda is Japan's largest
pharmaceuticals manufacturer. Yet in world terms, the Osaka-based companies
 -as well as the Tokyo-based groups - are pharmaceutical pygmies. Only
Takeda, is rated in the world top 20 drugs groups by sales, and only four
Japanese pharmaceuticals companies are in the top 30.
The reason is their failure to internationalise. In spite of some
small-scale and mostly disastrous overseas acquisitions, and occasional
investment in US and European development activities, the Japanese remain
dependent on their domestic market. Only four groups generate more 10 per
cent of their sales overseas.
Dependency on domestic sales has been all the more debilitating because of
the dire state of the Japanese market. The government, cash-strapped by
falling tax receipts during the recession and appalled by demographic trends
that indicate nearly a quarter of the population will be over 65 by the year
2025, has attempted to cut health-spending by attacking the drugs bill.
These efforts have included demand-side controls, as well as price cuts.
The combined consequences of the groups' lack of scale and the biennial
price cuts are immense. It means the Japanese spend less than their western
counterparts on R&amp;D, and what they do spend is often misdirected.
Admittedly, the industry spends a respectable proportion of sales on R&amp;D;
but because the groups' sales base is so small, the actual amounts available
remain pitiful compared with western organisations.
These meagre amounts might possibly be enough to assure survival, if they
were spent appropriately. But much R&amp;D investment is misdirected. Kunio
Takeda, president of Takeda Chemical, explains that in order to counter the
price cuts: 'Manufacturers resorted to launching modified (non-innovative)
compounds to conserve development costs and time. Such policies are likely
to damage the industry.'
This led to a massive rise in the number of new chemical entities developed
in Japan in recent years. The increase was mistaken by some observers as an
explosion in innovative research. Between 1975 and 1989, Japanese companies
launched 212 new chemical entities. Few of these were innovative enough to
be used overseas.
Given the Osaka-based groups' proximity to each other, consolidation would,
in theory, not be too arduous. Mergers tend to occur in Japan only when
companies are in crisis. Admittedly, no Japanese drugs group is losing
money, but the crisis assailing them is no less real. Drugs companies'
directors must swallow their pride, consolidate their industry, refocus R&amp;D,
and internationalise. The alternative is permanent marginalisation.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Survey of Kansai (5): Progress without vision - A look at
the impact of the new airport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'On a clear day you should be able to see Awaji Island across the water,'
the driver says, as he steers his taxi down the eye-catching, double-layered
bridge that spans the stretch of sea between the mainland and Kansai
International Airport (KIA).
'Unfortunately, there's usually a mist over the water, and it's hardly ever
possible to see the island,' he adds apologetically.
Kansai's striking new international airport may have many things in its
favour, but clarity of vision is not one of its strengths, whether in the
surrounding atmosphere or in its ambitious plans to become Japan's preferred
hub for international travel.
Seven years after construction work started, the airport, built on reclaimed
land about 4 kilometres off the shore of Osaka, opens 18 months late this
Sunday with less than half the expected number of flights, a sinking
foundation and uncertainty surrounding expansion plans that are crucial if
the airport is to become the gateway to the world that it hopes to be.
KIA's stumbling start throws into relief the lofty ambitions that inspired
its private and public owners to embark on the costly and daunting task of
building the world's first offshore airport.
The development that has been publicised as Japan's first 24-hour airport
was conceived as the much-needed public project to transform its host city,
Osaka, from an urban sprawl on the eastern edge of Asia to a shining
metropolis. The opening of Kansai's doors to greater international traffic,
it was believed, would place the region firmly on the map of every
globe-trotting policymaker and businessman, and do wonders to the regional
economy.
It may still happen. But even before its opening, the image of Kansai has
been hurt, rather than helped, by the airport and its myriad woes which have
overshadowed the positive aspects of the airport, such as the striking
terminal building designed by Italian architect Renzo Piano, or the
convenience it offers by servicing both domestic and international flights.
To many people, KIA is known as the sinking airport. The first ever to be
built on a man-made island, it ran up costs far exceeding initial estimates,
largely because the land on which it is built sank more than was expected
and had to be repeatedly fortified.
When experts gave opinions as to how much the island would sink, the airport
authorities, with characteristic Kansai optimism, took the lower end of
their estimates.
'While construction work was going on, it emerged that the worst scenario
was in fact the most accurate,' explains Mr Zenjiro Ogawa, managing director
and vice-president of Kansai International Airport Company (KIAC), the
airport's operators. The island will sink about one more metre, but this is
in line with expectations, he says reassuringly.
The result of the initial miscalculation, however, is that costs have surged
from Y1,000bn (Dollars 10m) to Y1,500bn, leaving the airport saddled with
over Y1,000bn in debt. Interest payments alone amount to Y100m a day, and
the airport is expected to suffer a loss of Y55bn in its first year.
'We have to explore whether we will have to redraw our long-term plan or
whether there is a way to avoid doing so,' concedes Mr Ogawa.
KIAC had planned to make a profit in five years, and to complete loan
repayments and start paying dividends in 23 years. But now the company
expects to have to delay repayment of loans.
In order to minimise the damage, KIAC was initially forced to set
landing-fees at a rate surpassing those at Narita, Tokyo's international
airport which until this month enjoyed the notoriety of being the world's
most expensive one.
The move backfired, however, and KIAC found itself unable to attract as many
flights as it had been hoped, because increasingly cost-conscious airlines
balked at having to pay Y995,000 each time they landed.
Airport officials were locked in negotiations until the last minute with the
International Air Transport Association (Iata), which found KIAC's fees
unacceptable.
'We are a private company, and we must collect fees that cover our costs,
otherwise we cannot exist,' Mr Ogawa protests. KIA's landing fees are only
10 per cent higher than those at Narita, an amount that airlines can easily
recoup by signing up a few extra customers, he says.
In the end, just weeks before the airport was scheduled to open, the KIAC
agreed to lower its fees to match those charged at Narita. But the move
hardly bodes well for KIA's efforts to earn as much as it can in fees
towards the construction of two more runways.
Without that increased capacity, KIA will not be able to realise its true
potential as an Asian hub. Having got over one hurdle, in setting initial
landing-fees, the airport operators now face another, even more contentious
battle over how much of the estimated expansion cost of about Y1,000m is to
be shouldered by the national and local governments, the local business
community and the airport itself.
Nevertheless, KIAC and the airport's loyal supporters in Kansai remain
optimistic about its long-term prospects.
Mr Takaharu Akitake, general manager of the Kansai economy research
department, at Daiwa Research Institute, is one who believes strongly that
the international airport will help revitalise the regional economy. Osaka
international airport, which had served the region's international needs, is
already up to capacity and has no room for expansion. The opening of KIA
will encourage new companies to locate in the Kansai region, and make it
easier to hold international conferences here, Mr Akitake points out. 'Osaka
then offers an alternative to Tokyo.'
The expected increase in cargo traffic will also help the regional economy.
As much as 85 per cent of air cargo in Japan is concentrated at Narita, the
world's largest handler of air cargo. Since a large proportion of this is
delivered to the Kansai area, KIA, which has the capacity to handle 1.4m
tonnes of cargo a year, is expected to take much of the burden off Narita.
The new airport is also expected to stimulate more business with Asia. KIA
offers direct flights to Asian countries not represented at Narita,
including Nepal, Vietnam and Mongolia.
Assuming that KIA signs up 397 international flights and 441 domestic
flights a week, the research institute expects the extra economic activity
generated by the airport to add 1.56 per cent to the gross regional product.
There is a shortage of airport facilities in Japan, Mr Ogawa points out.
'Narita is full, so the fact is that Japan needs another international
airport.'
Compared with Narita, which is far from Tokyo's domestic airport, KIA, which
serves both international and domestic flights, offers the convenience of
easy transit to and from principal cities throughout Japan and the world.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Survey of Kansai (4): A regional lesson for national rulers
 -Politics: A look at an enduring consensus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's lurch over the past year into an era of unstable coalition
governments has raised ironic smiles among Kansai politicians.
Mainstream political parties, with the expection of the eccentric
communists, have been working together in Kansai in what might be described
as loose coalitions for many years. They may have a lesson to teach their
national government colleagues in Tokyo, who struggle to achieve political
stability in their fourth government within the space of a year.
In Osaka and Kyoto, the two most populous of the six prefectures that make
up Kansai, local governors and mayors are chosen by agreement between the
main parties, and can count on cross-party support. Japan's tradition of
consensus remains strong in Kansai politics, just as it is breaking down on
the national stage.
'Politics here are entirely different from central politics. The Liberal
Democratic party (LDP) is in a minority and other parties are very strong,'
says Mr Hajime Ishii, member of parliament for the Japan Renewal party (JRP)
 -a national reform-minded group formed in June last year - from Hyogo
prefecture and former home affairs minister.
Mr Teiichi Aramaki, an independent in his eighth year as governor of Kyoto,
says the national political turmoil has had no impact on local politics. He
and his prefectural colleagues are more interested in defending the
interests of the community, than in waging backroom battles over political
philosophy.
The same habit of co-operation exists in Osaka. 'We decide our own policies,
and the governor co-ordinates if there is a discrepancy. We all support the
governor,' explains Mr Tokuo Nishikawa, secretary general of the left-wing
Social Democratic Party (SDP) in Osaka. 'Communications between parties here
are very good, and there is not much room for disagreement on the main
policies,' says his opposite number at the Osaka branch of the conservative
LDP, Mr Yoshio Matsui.
The balance of power in Osaka, the biggest prefecture, is more or less in
line with the national balance, with one exception. Komeito, the
Buddhist-linked clean-government party, has a stronger than average showing
there. It was founded in Osaka, and has strong support from lower middle
class employees of the prefecture's legions of small subcontractors, says
the SDP's Mr Nishikawa. Overall, the LDP has the strongest power base in
Osaka, with 48 seats on the 104-seat prefectural assembly, followed by the
SDP with 23, Komeito with 18, the Japan Communist party with 11, and three
independents.
Osaka politics may be different, but the need to maintain contacts in Tokyo
is as crucial as ever. The region is dependent on central government in
Tokyo for cash to fund its ambitious projects, such as a badly needed
extension to Kansai airport - short of capacity before it even opens - and
Kansai Science City.
Traditionally, local politicians have relied on three clear lines of
influence to defend their interests in central government; members of
parliament; the LDP's sectoral lobby groups, known as zoku; and direct
approaches to the government ministries concerned with particular issues.
The weakening of the LDP and its formerly powerful zoku, due to its 11-month
spell in opposition until returning to power at the end of June, means that
local politicians will increasingly rely on direct lobbying to the
government bureaucracy.
'It is a very slow system. It took us 10 years of lobbying to complete one
runway for the new airport, and now we need another one. Over the past year,
we have had a very hard time trying to get the budget for this. First the
governor had to approach the Hosokawa cabinet, then a few months later there
was the Hata cabinet, and now we are back in power,' says the LDP's Mr
Matsui.
The LDP, SDP, JRP and Komeito see eye to eye on the most important regional
policies, to continue promoting Kansai's big public works projects, to lobby
for greater budget independence from central government, and to channel more
financial support to the small businesses that make up the backbone of the
regional economy.
In Kyoto, the main item on governor Aramaki's big-ticket shopping list is a
new government guesthouse in the grounds of the city's former imperial
palace. He thinks it is high time the Japanese government lodged visiting
dignitaries in a traditional Japanese-style house, rather than the present
miniature of Versailles in central Tokyo. If Mr Aramaki gets his wish, which
hangs on a central government decision due in the next few months, he hopes
to persuade the government to hold the Group of Seven annual summit in
Kyoto, when it is Japan's next turn to host the G7 in 2000.
One of the most pressing concerns for the JRP's Mr Ishii is to give greater
control over fiscal policy to the prefectures. 'At the moment, two thirds of
the region's taxes go to central government, yet two thirds of regional
spending is made by local government. That means one third of tax revenues
have to be transferred from central to local government. We need direct
local taxation,' he says.
That, argues Mr Ishii, will be the key to transferring more power from
central government to the regions. This has been a subject of much political
debate and little concrete progress for the past decade, briefly relaunched
by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa's reform-minded government last year.
'Transferring more power to local government is a very slow business,
because we are still rooted in the strong central government traditions of
the Meiji era,' says Mr Ishii, referring to the birth of modern Japan in the
late 19th century. Mr Nishikawa, of Osaka's socialist group, believes
central government is becoming more sensitive to demands for
decentralisation.
At the LDP, Mr Matsui says his most important policy issue is to expand the
volume of low-interest loans for small businesses, to help them survive the
impact of the yen's rise. Here he is hoping to expand support for local
trust banks and farmers' co-operatives, which, unlike other banks, are
controlled by the prefecture rather than the ministry of finance in Tokyo.
Mr Matsui argues: 'The yen's rise companies all the way down the line, but
the smallest ones at the end of the chain of subcontracters are the most
vulnerable. We must do what we can.'

FT  01 SEP 94 / Survey of Kansai (2): Feeling good under grey skies - The
economy: Popular optimism runs ahead of actual recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ticket vending machines at Osaka station offer a convenience unknown in
other parts of Japan. Instead of having to patiently insert one coin at a
time, ticket buyers can throw in up to five coins all at once.
Right in front of the station, the traffic lights inform pedestrians how
much longer they must wait for the light to turn green.
The ticket machines and traffic lights suit the restless nature of the
tradesmen of Osaka, the commercial heartland of the Kansai region, where the
pace is fast and the people are irachi - or impatient, in the down-to-earth
local dialect.
Lately, the innate impatience of Osaka folk, coupled with their natural
optimism, has extended to their views of the economy, prompting a growing
feeling that the recovery which the whole of Japan has been anxiously
waiting for, has finally arrived.
It has arrived, Osaka street wisdom has it, not in Tokyo but in the Kansai.
Even the national press has highlighted the recent plethora of publications
on Kansai, the increase in new car registrations in June, and the jump in
travellers to the cities of Kyoto and Osaka this year, and has concluded
that Kansai is further down the road to recovery than Kanto, the region
consisting of Tokyo and its surrounding prefectures.
'Although it may not show in the statistics, people say that there is a
liveliness in the Kansai economy,' asserts Mr Takaharu Akitake, general
manager of the Kansai economy research department, at Daiwa Research
Institute in Osaka. 'There are no bright spots on the horizon in Tokyo as
far as the economy is concerned, but as a region, Kansai is feeling
healthy,' he says.
But available evidence hardly justifies such confidence. The region's gross
product fell last year for the first time in 18 years, by 0.1 per cent.
Osaka's business district suffers an embarrassing abundance of empty
offices, and the streets are littered with 'for rent' signs.
Commercial land prices in the Osaka area fell 19.5 per cent in 1992 and 24
per cent in 1993, while residential property prices saw a fall of 23 per
cent two years ago and 17 per cent last year, according to the Osaka chamber
of commerce and industry. And prices are still falling.
'For the next three years the Osaka market is going to be a tenants'
market,' says Mr Paul Boylan, a consultant to Sekisui House, Japan's largest
house builder. 'Rents are falling, land prices are falling and the knock-on
effect from the Kansai International Airport is not happening.'
Large new developments like the Osaka Business Park, Rokko Island and Rinku
Town were developed to meet rising demand for office space, but the collapse
of the property market since the turn of the decade has left many of the new
high-rise buildings only partially occupied.
Ambitious plans for Rinku Town, being developed at a site near the new
international airport, had to be cancelled, and Osaka prefecture is instead
making the space available temporarily for fairs and various events.
Nor have the banks based in the Kansai region been spared the massive bad
debts that have weighed heavily on Japan's financial system in the past few
years.
The region has had its share of scandals, stemming from the years of
financial and speculative excess in the late 1980s - such as the disclosure
that the prestigious Industrial Bank of Japan had made loans of up to Y240bn
to an Osaka restaurateur, who made speculative stock market purchases based
on seances and has been charged with fraud and forgery.
Companies based in Kansai, from Matsushita, the world's largest consumer
electronics company, to Obayashi, the general contractor which owns Bracken
House, are still suffering from the debilitating effects of Japan's longest
recession since the war.
Meanwhile, traditional industries, such as textiles, which used to support
the region's economy, have suffered not only from the downturn in consumer
spending but also from an influx of cheaper imports from other Asian
countries.
Nishijin, a town outside Kyoto where expensive, traditional silk kimono are
woven by hand, has seen the number of families in the business fall from
270,000 to just 20,000. 'At the present, Nishijin weaving is surviving as an
industry. But there is a question as to what will happen in five years'
time,' laments Mr Yoshio Katsuyama, a director of the Nishijin weavers'
industry union.
The slump in consumer spending, which has hit department stores sales
particularly hard, has forced Seibu, a prestigious retailer, to take the
unprecedented step of closing its store in Kobe.
Nevertheless, hopes are rising that, with the worst of the recession behind
it, Kansai can take the lead in pulling the country out of recession.
With the current coalition government facing an uncertain future, and with
many conventional business practices being questioned, Tokyo companies will
not be able to take advantage of their proximity to the central halls of
power, reckons Mr Yoshihiro Otani, general manager of public relations at
the Osaka chamber of commerce.
In contrast to Tokyo's current powerlessness, he says, 'Kansai businesses
have always relied on their own strength rather than on the central
government.'
Faced with uncertainty, Kansai is thus better placed to pull itself out of
the long downward spiral of the past few years by sheer ingenuity and drive.
'The 21st century is the era of Kansai,' Mr Otani declares.
Part of this optimism in Kansai can be attributed to the psychological
impact of the many large-scale projects that are expected to significantly
improve the area's infrastructure and increase its cultural and academic
appeal.
Apart from the international airport, which will bring more tourists and
businessmen to the area, the new roads and railways, built to accommodate
the increased traffic, the need for surrounding facilities, such as
distribution warehouses and conference halls, and new services, are expected
to raise economic activity. Investment in surrounding facilities totals
Y3,000bn (Dollars 30bn) says Daiwa's Mr Akitake.
In addition, projects to build facilities such as the Kansai Science City,
will bring research and cultural activities to the area. Science City, which
spans Osaka, Kyoto and Nara, is the site of the first multimedia experiments
being held under the auspices of the ministry of posts and
telecommunications.
The Akashi Kaikyo Bridge, connecting Awaji Island with the mainland, will
become the longest suspension bridge in the world. Wakayama, to the west of
Osaka, will host an international resort exposition this year on a reclaimed
island in the Sea of Japan.
All of this activity will help to spur economic growth in the Kansai region
by 1.3 per cent this year and 3.3 per cent in 1995, Daiwa Research
forecasts.
Observers also believe that the push for economic deregulation that is being
seen in Tokyo is another reason why Kansai has a better chance of recovery
than Tokyo. The region has always fostered an entrepreneurial spirit that
has in the past given rise to new businesses, such as instant noodles (which
have become a staple throughout Japan), self-service sushi bars and karaoke.
But for many years, Kansai has had to watch successful businesses move out
to Tokyo in order to be close to the sources of information and the seat of
political and bureaucratic power.
As the bureaucracy is increasingly forced to relax its grip on authority and
on information, more businesses will find it easier to grow in Kansai, and
the region will benefit from its intrinsic resourcefulness, Mr Akitake
believes.
'It would be dangerous to have everything concentrated in Tokyo,' he warns.
With the new airport, improved infrastructure and less red tape, Kansai can
now offer an alternative. 'This is not just for the good of Kansai, but the
good of Japan as a whole.'

FT  01 SEP 94 / Survey of Kansai (3): In place of the west - Trade links
with Asia are increasingly important
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To declare that Kansai has important commercial ties with Asia - as Kansai
officials and businessmen often do - is something of a truism: Japan's whole
economy is dependent on Asia, and Kansai is no exception.
Like other Japanese companies, Kansai-based corporations such as Matsushita
Electric and Sharp have invested and traded heavily in Asia. Like other
regions of Japan, Kansai has been affected by the strength of the yen, and
its industries are embarking on a new round of factory relocations from
Japan to cheaper sites in south-east Asia and China.
But Kansai boasts that its trade links with other Asian countries go back to
the eighth century, when Nara was a terminus of the silk road; and even to
the fifth century, when Osaka is said to have thrived as one of Japan's
first sea ports.
Today Kansai collectively continues to emphasise the importance of Asia and
Asia's fast-growing economies. Businessmen, disappointed by the performance
of their investments in Europe and America, sometimes take it for granted
that the west is in decline and therefore rely on Asia more than ever.
About 47 per cent of exports from Kansai go to Asia - more than to North
America and Europe combined. (Asia takes only 34 per cent of Japanese
exports as a whole). Asia also provides the biggest share of Kansai's
imports (43 per cent, compared with 32 per cent for the whole of Japan).
Traditionally, most of these imports to Japan have been raw materials or
agricultural and seafood products - logs from Asia's dwindling tropical
forests can be seen floating in the big lumber pools at Osaka's port - but
they now include electronic goods and vehicle components made by Japanese
factories in south-east Asia.
'We still serve as the gateway for south-east Asian products, and also we've
made large-scale investments in practically all countries in Asia,' says Mr
Michio Sugimoto, managing director of the Osaka chamber of commerce and
industry. In the lobby of the chamber's building, a digital sign keeps track
of the rise of the yen against the dollar, an obsession for Japanese
companies which are finding it harder and harder to compete in international
markets.
'Lots of small companies in Osaka are now thinking of investing in Asia,
including China and Vietnam,' says Mr Kazuo Ishii, director general of the
Japan External Trade Organisation's Osaka branch.
The potential of China's domestic market of 1.2bn people and the size of its
labour force have attracted intense interest - and investments - from local
businesses; the ports of Kobe and Osaka handle some 40 per cent of Japan's
growing trade with China. 'One of our staff in Osaka who came from Beijing
is now very busy giving lectures on China,' says Mr Ishii.
Kansai's reputation as a centre of commerce is enhanced by the large number
of foreigners living in the region. They include half of Japan's 700,000
Koreans (who provide links to both South and North Korea), Indians based in
Kobe (who trade with Africa and the Indian subcontinent), and Chinese
residents.
Both the Osaka Foreign Trade Association and the Kansai Economic Federation
(Kankeiren) are seeking to strengthen their links with the overseas Chinese,
who dominate commerce and distribution throughout much of Asia.
Japanese government organisations, along with local authorities and
businesses in Kansai, have also promoted several big projects to improve
Kansai's standing as an Asian and international commercial centre.
These include the new airport, whose 24-hour operation will be particularly
useful for regional air freight services used for everything from seafood
and cut flowers to microchips, and the Asia and Pacific Trade Centre (ATC)
opened in Osaka in April.
One of the ATC's principal aims is to promote imports from Asia, to deflect
criticism of Japan's trade surpluses and the difficulty of selling goods in
the Japanese market.
'We'd like to energise transport links between Japan and the rest of the
world, and traditionally this area has strong ties with east Asia,' says Mr
Tetsuro Kawakami, chairman of Kankeiren and of Sumitomo Electric Industries.
In the future increasingly high-level technology will be transferred from
Japan to other countries in Asia, he believes. 'We can't survive without our
east Asian partners,' says Mr Kawakami. 'We have to divide our work with
them.'

FT  01 SEP 94 / Survey of Kansai (1): A beautiful window of diverse pieces -
Deregulation, infrastructural developments and its own resourcefulness all
contribute to the region's confidence that it can at last compete with
Japan's national capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a recent television advertisement, aired in western Japan, demons that
bring poverty in national folklore were shown dressed in rags, stalking the
grounds of Osaka castle. On hearing of the convenient new Kansai
International Airport, they decide to take advantage of its opening to fly
east to Tokyo.
The joke, at the expense of the Japanese capital, captures the current mood
in Kansai, the region made up of the six prefectures of Osaka, Hyogo, Kyoto,
Nara, Wakayama and Shiga that span the western stretch of Japan's main
island of Honshu, between the scenic Lake Biwa on the east and the Chugoku
mountain range on the west.
After years of trying to catch up and compete with Tokyo, and of suffering
unflattering comparisons with its more cosmopolitan rival as a result,
Kansai has recently begun to feel a greater confidence in what it has to
offer as an alternative to the capital.
'The advantage of being in Kansai is that you are less disrupted by
political noise,' says Mr Tsuzo Murase, executive vice-president of
Matsushita, the world's largest consumer electronics group, which has its
headquarters in Osaka.
Businessmen point to the greater openness of Kansai people to new ideas,
compared with Tokyo, their ability to make quick decisions and their talent
for spotting new business opportunities, as evidence that the region is
better suited to the more competitive business environment in the 1990s.
Confidence in the region is such that the 21st century is being hailed as
the era of Kansai, as opposed to Tokyo.
What will make Kansai so special in the years ahead, according to its
proponents, is the different opportunities the region offers from Tokyo. For
one thing, its relative proximity to the Asian continent and the large
number of non-Japanese Asian visitors it receives each year, gives Kansai a
better chance than Tokyo of capitalising on the huge potential for growth
that the continent holds.
The recent momentum behind deregulation in Japan also offers hope that, as
the central bureaucracy in Tokyo is forced to loosen its tight hold on
economic life, Kansai - birthplace of many unique new businesses, ranging
from karaoke and sushi served on conveyor belts to capsule hotels - will be
better able to capitalise on its gift for coming up with enterprising ideas.
Even the diversity and traditional lack of cohesiveness of the Kansai region
 -a curious collection of six prefectures, each with its own distinct
cultural and historical identity, which seem to have little in common except
their proximity to each other - is beginning to be appreciated as a source
of the region's vitality.
Mr Masafumi Onishi, chairman of the Osaka chamber of commerce and industry,
and of Osaka Gas, likens Kansai to a stained-glass window in which very
different parts make up a beautiful whole.
But the infectious optimism that pervades the Kansai establishment stems
also from a conviction that, with the recent completion of a range of
ambitious infrastructural projects, the region is finally coming into its
own. For the first time in many years, Kansai people feel they have
everything that their compatriots in Tokyo have.
From this month, the region will have the impressive new international
airport that is slated to offer Japan's first 24-hour air terminal services,
and which will be a hub for domestic flights. Osaka Bay, along which lie
some of the region's most vibrant cities, such as Osaka itself and Kobe, a
famous port, is now the proud home of no fewer than three man-made islands,
one of which is the site of the new airport.
The narrow corridor of sea that separates the city of Akashi, in Hyogo
prefecture, from Awaji island will soon be spanned by a spectacular
suspension bridge that, it is claimed, will be the longest in the world. And
further south, just off the coast of Wakayama prefecture, another artificial
island has been built to accommodate Japan's biggest marina.
On land, a vast science, culture and art centre, covering 15,000 hectares in
the three prefectures of Kyoto, Osaka and Nara, is taking shape; while the
skylines of principal cities in the region have been transformed by the
high-rise office buildings and expansive business parks, such as the Osaka
business park near the Osaka castle, that have been built in recent years.
This frantic investment in infrastructure, which is costing the regional
economy dearly, was Kansai's response to a sense of crisis that gripped its
economic leaders several years ago. Unless something was done to revitalise
the region, they feared, its vitality could be sapped by the growing
dominance of Tokyo and its neighbouring prefectures on the Kanto plains.
Tokyo, the centre of Japan's political, economic and cultural life since the
end of the war, seemed to have everything; while Kansai, which encompasses
the ancient capitals of Nara and Kyoto as well as the merchants' city of
Osaka and the port city of Kobe, has long been regarded as a region steeped
in history and bubbling with creative ideas, but not quite able to claim the
world-class stature of Tokyo.
While Kansai's gross regional product is equal approximately to that of
Canada, and is forecast to exceed that of the UK by the year 2000, there has
been a strong feeling among the business community that the region's
economic vitality has not received the recognition it deserves.
Osaka, Kansai's economic powerhouse, boasts a stock exchange that is the
fourth largest in the world by market capitalisation, global giants such as
Matsushita, and the largest concentration of pharmaceuticals companies in
the country. Its history as a merchant town has encouraged an
entrepreneurial spirit and an openness to new ideas that is unknown in
Tokyo; and it has created a distinct culture that gave birth to such
national phenomena as Yoshimoto Kogyo, an entertainment company that has
provided Japan with most of its famous comedians.
Kyoto and Nara, two ancient capitals, are treasure-houses of traditional
Japanese culture; while Kyoto is the home of many vibrant new businesses,
ranging from the industrial ceramics leader Kyocera to Nintendo, the video
games company. Kobe, a famous port renowned for its tender beef, is also a
bustling commercial centre.
Despite these accomplishments, Kansai has, for much of Japan's post-war
history, felt that it has been forced to play second fiddle to Tokyo.
Moreover, in recent years the increasing concentration of wealth and
information in the capital has led many businesses that originated in Kansai
to move their headquarters operations to Tokyo. Kansai's share of Japan's
GNP fell from 18.2 per cent in 1980 to 17.2 per cent in 1990, according to
the Centre for Revitalising Kansai Industry.
Concern among Kansai business leaders about the deteriorating state of the
economy had prompted a long period of collective angst, particularly in
Osaka, as they jealously watched Tokyo reap what seemed an unequal share of
the benefits and the glory of Japan's post-war economic miracle.
However, the gradual completion of big infrastructural projects is raising
hopes that the region now has the means to compete for both business and
recognition. In the next few years, it will have the means to accommodate
its expected growth in economic activity.
The bigger immediate challenge is to show that, in the aftermath of a
prolonged nationwide recession and a regional spending spree, it can still
generate that activity.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Drought threatens Ghanaian
aluminium smelter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Drought conditions in Ghana have caused power authorities in the Volta Lake
region to declare force majeure on its supply contracts to the Volta
Aluminum Company (Valco) smelter, which this year was projected to produce
140,000 tonnes of aluminium.
The smelter is 90 per cent owned by Texas-based Kaiser Aluminum, with the
minority interest held by Reynolds Metals.
Kaiser officials are negotiating with the government of Ghana to avoid the
power cut-off, but at present are facing at September 10 shutdown date.
If the negotiations are unsuccessful, Kaiser faces the loss of nearly
one-third of its current global production. Kaiser has global capacity to
produce 508,000 tonnes of aluminium annually, but has been operating at
about 77 per cent of that capacity, or about 390,000 tonnes per year.
It cut output at the Valco plant by about 30 per cent this spring, because
of the low water conditions.
Mr Robert Irelan, a Kaiser spokesman, said the company was examining its
options for replacing metal lost if Valco were shut down. Those options
included restarting idled potlines in the US Pacific north-west, where low
water has also interrupted the supply of cheap hydro-electric power.
Kaiser's Mead smelter in Spokane, Washington, is operating at only 75 per
cent of its annual 200,000 tonne rated capacity.
The Ghanaian smelter was last shut by drought in 1983, when it remained idle
for two years. The Valco plant employs about 1,600 people, most of whom are
Ghanaian nationals, and is an important source of foreign exchange for
Ghana.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian cotton estimate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BOMBAY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
India's officially-sponsored Cotton Advisory Board has estimated the
country's 1993-94 (September/August) crop at 12.1m bales (170kg each),
compared with the previous year's 14m, according to traders, reports Reuters
from Bombay.
Meeting on the eve of the new season, the CAB did not give reasons for the
lower crop but traders said the shortfall, occurring mainly in the northern
states of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan, was caused by floods and pests.
East India Cotton Association president Mr CH Mirani said the CAB estimates
were lower than the 12.3m anticipated by trade associations.
The world cotton production estimates for 1994-95 had been raised slightly
to 19.01m tonnes, from an end-July figure of 18.849m, the Liverpool-based
industry publication Cotton Outlook said.
The figure reflected a rise in the US estimate to 4.106m tonnes from 4.002m
a month earlier.
China's projected output remained at 4.3m tonnes, with India's and
Pakistan's unchanged at 2.295m and 1.7m tonnes respectively. The Australian
crop estimate was down to 341,000 tonnes from 386,000 because of drought.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold market prospects 'very
finely balanced'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold market prospects look 'very finely balanced', according to Gold Fields
Mineral Services, a London-based research company.
In an update to its Gold 1994 report, published today, the company says that
a good case can be made for suggesting that the metal's price will break out
of the recent trading range, 'either on the upside or the downside'.
The direction of the break-out will depend, it says, on 'the interplay
between wealth creation, inflation, interest rates and finally, perceptions
about gold's fundamentals'.
In the first half of this year mine production continued to grow at an
annualised rate of 2 per cent, taking account of seasonal factors, says the
update. But net official sector supply changed dramatically. 'While not
actually reversing to a position of net buying, the level of sales (by
central banks) dropped to only 36 tonnes (compared with 244 tonnes in the
second half of last year and 275 tonnes in the first half). 'Instead of
sales,' GFMS explains, 'the activities of official participants have been
largely confined to lending and swapping gold.'
Meanwhile, forward selling by producers continued to decrease and, 'with the
continued repayment of gold loans, this has resulted in producer hedging
contributing more than 90 tonnes to the demand side of the equation'.
'The above changes might have been expected to produce a positive impact on
sentiment and price,' the update says. But they have been countered by
significant disinvestment in Europe and North America as investors,
disillusioned with the gold price's reduced volatility, switched their
attention to other commodity markets. Successive increases in US interest
rates also dampened interest in buying gold.
The jewellery sector's demand for gold this year has reflected 'a mix of
some very disparate trends', says GFMS: 'the continued improvement in the
United States; the sluggishness so far of European demand to respond to
improved economic conditions; extremely weak offtake in the Middle East;
and, finally, the price-elastic response (relative to the first half of
1993) of jewellery (demand) in the Far East'.
The net result has been a moderate first half rise to a level that remains
nearly 14 per cent below the first half figure in 1993.
GFMS sees scope for sharp upturns in European jewellery sector demand for
gold, as consumer confidence improves, and in Middle Eastern demand, as this
year's oil price recovery feeds through.
'But it is in the Far East that the most intractable question lies: namely,
did this year's recovery in physical offtake represent consumers beginning
to adjust to the higher price level, or alternatively, was it an example of
pent-up demand following the buyers' strike of the second half of last
year?'
GFMS suggests that, 'with other things being equal', the former explanation
would point to further rises in offtake and the latter to a slowdown.
'But of course, other things will not be equal,' it says. If China's
monetary policy is loosened before the economy has cooled sufficiently 'the
impact on confidence could easily initiate a new hedge-buying gold rush,
similar to what was seen in 1992.
'On the other hand, some of this year's (gold) fabrication in China appears
to have gone into increasing retail inventories which may have to be worked
off before a real improvement in offtake can take place.'
GFMS sees the level of world-wide investment or disinvestment as 'arguably .
. . the element in the market which will have the greatest impact in the
short term.
'If inflation looks like gaining the upper hand over the efforts of central
banks to keep it in check, there could easily be a renewed surge in
hedge-buying of gold.
'But again, perceptions about the gold market's fundamentals and interest
rates will be crucial in determining investment strategies. A break-out of
the price on the upside could galvanise investors and result in a
self-fuelling rally, whereas if the price were to show the same lack of
movement that characterised the first half, a continued drift away from the
market could be expected.'

The copper price is likely to rise sharply during the final quarter of this
year and into 1995 as stocks fall towards a critical four weeks' supply,
according to London broker Hambros Equities UK, reports Reuters.
In a special report Hambros forecast that stocks held by producers,
consumers and merchants, now equivalent to 5.5 weeks' supply, would fall
rapidly from mid-September, as they did between January and July.
Hambros analyst Mr Christopher Pearson said copper prices could then reach
150 cents a pound, compared with about 113 cents at present.
If the decline in London Metal Exchange stocks matched the pace of falls
earlier this year, the total could reach 180,000 tonnes by the end of the
year, the report said.
'Before allowing for any movement in producer and consumer stocks, this
would lower the stocks consumption ratio by about 0.3 weeks supply to about
4.7 weeks by December 31.'
Net new production of 460,000 tonnes next year was unlikely to meet rising
world-wide consumption, it said. In response to synchronised economic
recovery copper consumption growth of 6.5 per cent this year would be
followed by a 5.8 per cent increase in 1995.
Western world consumption would exceed supply in both 1994 and 1995, leading
to stocks falling to three weeks availability next year.
'Below four weeks of supply, copper prices have tended to rise almost
exponentially,' said Hambros. 'Therefore, we expect the price to spike above
150 cents a pound during the first half of 1995.'

FT  01 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME copper rally continues
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Copper prices continued their rally yesterday at the London Metal Exchange,
reaching the highest levels since July's two-year peak.
A burst of investment fund buying in mid-session took the three months
delivery price through resistance around the Dollars 2,500-a-tonne mark,
traders told the Reuters news agency. The price touched Dollars 2,520 a
tonne before easing back to Dollars 2,509.50 at the close, up Dollars 39.75
on the day.
The aluminium market was also strong, aided by news of problems at Kaiser's
Ghanaian operation (see next story). Having reached Dollars 1,534.50 a tonne
at the close the three months position added nearly Dollars 10 in after
hours trading.
News that a strike had been averted at the Sudbury, Ontario, operation of
Falconbridge, the second largest western nickel producer, only briefly
interrupted the metal's price rise.
Yesterday's Dollars 134 rise to Dollars 6,259 a tonne for three months
delivery took the advance over the last seven trading days to Dollars
481.50.
Falconbridge said it reached agreement early yesterday morning with mine,
mill and smelter workers to avert the threatened strike, reports Reuters
from Toronto.
'We have an agreement as of 05:15 (local time)' said company spokesman Mr
Gerald Foley at a Sudbury hotel where management and union representatives
had been negotiating through the night. The Canadian Auto Workers Union,
which represents the Sudbury workers, had threatened to strike if no
agreement was reached by 8am.
Mr Foley said the new contract would be for three years but disclosed no
further details of the deal, which covers some 1,400 workers.
The Sudbury plant last year produced 38,300 tonnes of nickel, 47,200 tonnes
of copper and 800 tonnes of cobalt.

FT  01 SEP 94 / World Commodities Prices: Profit-taking trims coffee gains -
Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures ended firmer but off six-week highs
as profit-taking set in following a rally fuelled by trade, speculative and
roaster buying and a bullish New York market, traders said.
The November position, which had rebounded from an early low of Dollars
3,700 to touch Dollars 3,840 a tonne at one stage, ended the day at Dollars
3,773 a tonne, up just Dollars 18 on balance.
'It was quite a run, reflecting mixed buying and New York's rally,'
explained one dealer. Both selling and buying here were technically
inspired, he added.
Other dealers said the London rally was encouraged by New York breaking
resistance at 220 cents a pound in early trade. But the December position at
the US market later backed off to 213 cents.
COCOA futures closed lower but well off their lows after responding to a
firmer New York market, dealers said. New York was on the upswing at midday
amid light activity, they added.
At the close London's December was down Pounds 10 at Pounds 1,013 a tonne
after trading between Pounds 1,003 and Pounds 1,044.
Market players were still awaiting fresh news of the Ivory Coast's crop, the
dealers said. In its daily report private US-based forecaster Weather
Services said the Ivory Coast's cocoa regions needed more rain as below
normal shower activity continued in West Africa. 'Light showers are
providing only some relief to dry conditions in Ivorian cocoa regions, and
some reduction in crop production is likely,' the report said.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Government Bonds: European sector waits for the Bundesbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European government bond markets were uneventful as dealers marked time
before the Bundesbank's council meeting today. Most markets moved in a
narrow trading range and volume remained thin.
Analysts view today's Bundesbank meeting as the last chance for it to
announce any changes to official interest rates before the German federal
elections in October. However, apart from a possible return to a
variable-rate repo, the market does not expect the Bundesbank to make any
policy changes.
On Liffe, the September bund future moved between a high of 91.99 and a low
of 91.66 before trading at 91.79 in the late afternoon, down 0.19 points on
the day.
The prospect of a large supply of government bond issuance also prevented
bond prices from recouping the losses they had made the previous day in the
wake of the unexpected base rate rise by leading French banks.
France is expected to seek around FFr20bn through an auction of 10-year
paper today and Italy is hoping to raise around L14,000bn this week. Spain
is also issuing paper with three, five and 10-year maturities.
Dealers said the disappointing reception given to the Dutch government bond
auction this week showed that investors remained reluctant to buy bonds.
Sales of the Dutch 7.25 per cent bond reached Fl 6.4bn after three days of
subscription, during which the government had to reduce the price of the
bonds twice.
On the Matif, the notional French government bond future was virtually
unchanged in the late afternoon, up just 0.02 at 113.30.
The UK government bond market opened with an easier bias following the early
morning leak of the results of the survey of UK purchasing managers,
published by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply. The survey
showed that the price index rose to a seasonally adjusted 73.7 per cent last
month, up from 73.2 per cent in July.
Although the shorter end of the yield curve remained nervous ahead of next
week's publication of minutes of the monthly meeting between the chancellor
and the Bank of England governor, longer-dated gilts showed marginal gains.
On Liffe, the December long gilt future, which saw higher volume levels than
the September contract as traders rolled their positions forward, rose  1/16
to 101.
Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi, said that although the
undertone to the market remained bullish, higher volume was needed to drive
prices higher.
US bond prices ended with modest gains yesterday afternoon despite fresh
evidence of inflationary pressures.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  1/8 better
at 100 9/16 , with the yield dipping to 7.446 per cent and the two-year note
was up  1/32 at 100 3/16 , to yield 6.132 per cent.
It was the second straight day in which bonds reversed course in mid-stream
and pushed into positive territory.
Early on, the market stumbled when confronted by a mixed bag of economic
indicators. The Purchasing Management Association of Chicago revealed that
its August prices-paid index had jumped to 79.3 per cent, from 71.9 per cent
in July. Even though it also reported a slight dip in overall business
activity, the market was concerned about the possibility of higher prices
feeding into the consumer sector.
The Commerce Department supported the suggestion of a cooling economy with
data showing a 2.3 per cent drop in July factory orders. But the market
seemed to ignore that news, too.
However, trading conditions were thin, with many traders on holiday or
waiting for the release of employment data on Friday. As a result, bonds
improved gradually as the afternoon progressed although there were no
additional developments to alter the mood.

FT  01 SEP 94 / International Bonds: Opportunities in lire tempt borrowers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Eurobond market saw a number of small, mainly retail-driven offerings
yesterday in a variety of currencies, continuing the trend of recent days.
The Italian lira market saw several offerings. Borrowers are being tempted
into lire by profitable arbitrage opportunities caused by high investor
demand, syndicate managers said, and investors by historically high coupon
levels and the flatness of the yield curve in the three to 10-year area.
However some syndicate managers questioned the timing of these deals in the
lira market, which they said is nearing saturation point.
Nestle Finance France launched a L150bn offering of two-year bonds with a
coupon of 11 per cent, which lead manager Swiss Bank Corporation said
performed well, despite aggressive pricing.
In the dollar sector, Okobank launched a Dollars 150m offering of perpetual
bonds callable after five years and yielding 150 basis points over six-month
Libor for the first five years, and 300 points over thereafter.
Syndicate managers said the deal was well priced and performed well. Lead
manager Goldman Sachs said the issue was mainly bought by institutional
investors although there was also good retail demand.
SNCF, the French national railway, tapped the D-Mark market for the first
time in 11 years with a retail-driven DM300m offering of five-year bonds
aimed at Swiss and Benelux investors.
The National Bank of Hungary came to the Swiss franc market for the first
time this year with an issue of SFr150m five-year bonds, increased from
SFr100m, offering a coupon of 8 1/4 per cent. The bonds were sold primarily
to banks with strong retail distribution in continental Europe, lead manager
Merrill Lynch said.
Argentina is expected to come to the Eurobond market in the next few days,
in a deal lead-managed by Paribas Capital Markets, with an offering of
CDollars 100m three-year bonds.

FT  01 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Flexible options play blamed
for Dow rally - Derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An 18-month-old derivative product caught the attention of Wall Street last
week when a respected money manager's options play, representing a mere
Dollars 100m in underlying stock value, was blamed for igniting a 70-point
rally in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday afternoon.
Insiders scoff at the idea that such a small options play could move the
market so substantially.
However, the event and subsequent publicity have created an awareness that a
new and fast-growing variety of exchange-traded options might introduce a
new sort of volatility into stocks.
Mr William Mullen, managing director of Loomis, Sayles and Company, a firm
that manages money for a variety of pension funds, was reported to be
engaged in a portfolio enhancement strategy that has been popular over the
last nine months because it works best in markets that are static or which
are on a downwards trend.
Known in the industry as 'index overwriting', it involves writing, or
selling, call options on popular stock indices like the Standard &amp; Poor's
100 or 500 for the income the options sale generates.
Over the past year, derivatives traders say, such call writing could have
added a full 1 per cent of return on a fund's investments.
The calls sold are generally 5 per cent or more 'out of the money', meaning
that the underlying index would have to rally by at least 5 per cent to give
the calls any value to their buyers.
The strategy works best with 'short-dated' options that expire six to eight
weeks after they are sold, since research has shown that the stock market
rarely rallies by 5 per cent to 7 per cent in most 45- to 60-day periods.
The call writer faces a loss only if the market rallies and throws the
options 'into the money' by expiration.
The strategy is best applied using flexible exchange options, or 'flex'
options, a product introduced to the world by the Chicago Board Options
Exchange in early 1993.
Flex options are the exchange's answer to competition from over-the-counter
structured instruments. They allow traders to tailor their own options
terms, including expiration dates, and have a Dollars 10m minimum
transaction size.
Until flex options were introduced, all US exchanged-traded options expired
either once a month, or quarterly.
Index overwriters like Mr Mullen tend to stagger their flex options call
writing to ensure a steady stream of premium income, making just about any
day an options expiration day.
When conditions are right, options expirations present sophisticated
derivatives traders with attractive arbitrage opportunities.
This was best observed in the late 1980s, when the 'triple witching'
quarterly expirations of stock index futures, stock options, and stock index
options often caused the US stock market to pitch and roll in the final hour
of that day's trading.
Regulators tamed those quarterly events by staggering the expiry times of
the three types of instruments, and the New York Stock Exchange began
publishing lists of stocks for which there are derivatives-related order
imbalances on any important expiration day.
In last week's case, traders say a stock market rally had put the flex
options calls that Mr Mullen wrote at the American Stock Exchange close to
the money, and that related stock and futures purchases by people on the
opposite side of his trade helped stock prices shoot up, causing him to take
a loss.
Mr Rob Merrilees, a managing partner with G-Bar corporation, a Chicago-based
trading firm that specialises in equity-linked derivatives, said that while
flex options have become increasingly popular with institutional investors,
they are still such a small part of the market that it would be unlikely for
them to be to blame for underlying stock market volatility.
'Their size by comparison just pales next to the options and futures that
expire on a monthly and quarterly basis,' he says.
Mr David Hall, vice-president for institutional marketing at the Chicago
Board Options Exchange, says there were flex options contracts representing
about Dollars 13.5bn in underlying stock value open at his exchange at the
beginning of the week.
That is about double the amount represented by the flex products a year ago,
and institutional interest continues to grow.
Other exchanges, such as the American and Philadelphia Stock Exchanges and
the Chicago Board of Trade, have adapted the flex options concept to their
own products, and the London International Financial Futures Exchange is
seriously considering launching flexible exchange options products.

Fletcher Challenge, the New Zealand-based forestry, energy and construction
company, yesterday reported consolidated net earnings of NZDollars 675m
(USDollars 406m), including after-tax abnormal gains of NZDollars 367m, for
the year to end-June, agencies report.
In the previous year, the group's net earnings were NZDollars 382m,
including after-tax abnormal gains of NZDollars 79m.
Consolidated net earnings excluding abnormal items were NZDollars 308m
compared with NZDollars 303m a year earlier. The result included taxation
(excluding tax on the abnormal items) of NZDollars 35m, compared with a tax
credit of NZDollars 120m in the previous year.
Fletcher Challenge also reported, for the first time, on full-year earnings
of the Ordinary Division and the Forests Division, which were created last
December. The two divisions are represented by separately listed shares, and
dividend payments relate directly to the economic performance of the
businesses within each.
Net Ordinary Division earnings for the year, including combination
adjustments of NZDollars 58m, were NZDollars 649m. In-cluded in this amount
were net abnormal items after taxation of NZDollars 367m, relating mainly to
the gains on the sales of Wrightson and Methanex.
Directors have recommended a final Ordinary Division dividend of 6.25 cents
a share, making a total of 12.5 cents a share for the full year.
Forests Division net earnings were NZDollars 62m, with no abnormal items.
Directors have recommended a final Forests Division dividend of 3 cents a
share, making a total of 6 cents a share for the full year.

<TEXT>
Television Broadcasts, Hong Kong's premier television company, yesterday
surprised the stock market when it reported a 70 per cent increase in
first-half net earnings to HKDollars 278m (USDollars 36m) from HKDollars
163.5m.
The higher-than-expected profits at TVB were struck on turnover up nearly 36
per cent to HKDollars 1.18bn from HKDollars 871m in the previous half.
Earnings per share of 66 cents were nearly 70 per cent up on last year.
The company said it had experienced strong growth in demand for advertising
airtime and cited advertising directed at property investment in China as
one of the main forces behind this.
TVB is seen as one of the strongest media companies in Asia. Recently
Pearson, the UK group which publishes the Financial Times, entered
negotiations to acquire 10 per cent of TVB. These talks have since stalled.
Mr Lau Siu-chuen, media analyst at Morgan Stanley, said there were a number
of special factors which helped boost profits in the first half compared
with a year earlier.
The most important of these was a change in the Hong Kong government's
advertising royalties. A year ago the government took 12 per cent of TVB's
advertising revenues but now takes 10 per cent. TVB, as with all other Hong
Kong companies, has also benefited from a 1 percentage point cut in the
corporate rate.
Directors declared an interim dividend of 20 cents a share, up 33 per cent
on the corresponding period last year.

FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: Ansett turnround lifts TNT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A strong contribution from its 50 per cent interest in Ansett Airlines and
continued improvements in core operations helped TNT, the large Australian
transportation and package delivery group, to an equity-accounted profit
after tax and abnormal items of ADollars 105.1m (USDollars 78m) in the year
to end-June.
Group revenues were ADollars 5.69bn, up from ADollars 5.52bn previously.
The result compares with a loss of ADollars 256.7m a year earlier, when TNT
faced some heavy one-off charges.
In the latest period, abnormal items contributed an after-tax surplus of
ADollars 57m, partly due to gains on both asset sales and foreign currency
movements at Ansett, in contrast to the 1992-93 charge of ADollars 212.1m.
However, even at the trading level, there was an improvement. Operating
profit before tax rose to ADollars 127.5m from ADollars 14.8m on an
equity-consolidated basis, and edged up to ADollars 45.8m from ADollars
44.3m on a statutory consolidated basis.
TNT said the advance was largely due to the turnround at Ansett, and reduced
losses in its GD Express Worldwide business, its express delivery joint
venture.
The company said that full-year results at GD Express were still below
expectations, having been hindered by aggressive competition, although the
fourth quarter was in line with estimates.
It said that the better economic outlook in main markets, coupled with cost
reduction measures, should 'bring substantial financial improvement in the
current year'.
The core Australian business saw operating earnings improve 'significantly',
while Canada also showed 'an exceptional turnround'. The UK business earned
record profits, and Germany improved.
There is no dividend.

FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: Santander sells 1.47% of Banesto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banco Santander has sold 1.47 per cent of Banesto, the troubled bank it took
over earlier this year, to La Caixa, the Barcelona-based savings bank. The
deal could foreshadow wider agreements between the two leading domestic
financial institutions.
La Caixa, which paid Pta7.4bn (Dollars 57.4m) for the stake, said the
acquisition, an unprecedented investment by a savings institution in a
leading commercial bank, was a 'purely financial investment'. It rejected
speculation that it formed part of a 'non-aggression pact' with Santander.
The savings bank paid Pta830 per Banesto share, well below the average
trading price during August of more than Pta1,000 for Banesto stock.
Santander paid Pta762 per Banesto share to take control of the bank in
April.
It emerged, however, that the purchase, which makes the savings bank
Banesto's fourth largest shareholder, coincided with a Pta13.6bn sale by La
Caixa to Santander in early August of 0.7 per cent of its equity in
Telefonica, the telecommunications company.
La Caixa, ranked second after Italy's Cariplo among European savings banks,
earned Pta5bn in capital gains from its Telefonica share sale to Santander.
The disposal lowered La Caixa's equity in Telefonica to 1.3 per cent
although it remains one of its largest individual shareholders.
Market sources believe that there could be further deals between La Caixa
and Santander.

FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: Philip Morris in Dollars 6bn
buy-back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Philip Morris, the US food and tobacco group, is launching one of the
biggest share buy-backs ever mounted in the US.
The group's board yesterday authorised the management to repurchase and
cancel up to Dollars 6bn of the company's shares over the next three years.
It also voted to increase the dividend by 19.6 per cent, to 82.5 cents from
69 cents a share in the previous quarter
The moves sent Philip Morris shares leaping yesterday by Dollars 2 1/2 to
Dollars 61 - their highest level in more than a year.
Philip Morris prepared the ground for yesterday's moves in May after Mr
Michael Miles, the then chairman and chief executive, fell out with the
board over his support for a plan to hive off the group's tobacco operations
into a separate entity.
The idea was to lift the group's share price by relieving the company of its
controversial cigarette-making activities. But Mr Miles' successors - Mr
William Murray, chairman, and Mr Geoffrey Bible, chief executive - ruled out
a split, promising other methods of lifting the share price.
Stock repurchase programmes tend to increase a company's share price because
they reduce the amount of shares in issue, so increasing earnings per share.
They are widely used by US companies with cash to spare as a means of
delivering value to shareholders.
Philip Morris's cigarette-making operations produce particularly large
amounts of cash.
According to Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, the group as a
whole last year generated about Dollars 3bn in free cash flow - that is,
cash left over after paying for capital expenditure and dividends.
The stock repurchases announced yesterday, if fully exercised, would cost
Dollars 2bn a year, and the increase in the quarterly dividend would cost
Dollars 576m a year if sustained for the full year.
This suggests that Philip Morris should have little difficulty in funding
its new commitments from existing cash resources.
The stock repurchase plan is the latest of a series of buy-backs mounted by
Philip Morris. In November 1991 it authorised a Dollars 2bn buy-back and in
May 1992 it authorised a further Dollars 3bn worth of repurchases.

FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: Abnormal charges put MIM in red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIM Holdings, the Queensland-based metals and mining group, yesterday
announced a ADollars 195.1m (USDollars 145m) loss after tax in the year to
end-June, largely resulting from heavy abnormal charges. In the previous
year, it had made a ADollars 74m profit.
Revenues were ADollars 2.31bn, up from ADollars 2.02bn previously.
The abnormal charges amounted to ADollars 170m before tax last year,
compared with ADollars 80.8m in 1992-93.
In large part, they were due to the restructuring of MIM's interests in
Germany and included a ADollars 95m write-off of goodwill at the Duisburg
zinc smelter, in which MIM has acquired a 100 per cent interest, and a
ADollars 50m provision for the reduced value of its investment in Berzelius
Umwelt Service, the recycling business.
However, even at the pre-tax level, and before exchange differences, MIM
made a much reduced profit of ADollars 43.3m, compared with ADollars 126.8m
in the previous year, with an ADollars 16.9m loss coming in the fourth
quarter, against a loss of ADollars 13.2m.
The company said it had not been a good year and it had been hit by lower
metal prices. The average copper price, in Australian dollar terms, was down
by 14 per cent from the previous year, while lead was 7 per cent lower, and
zinc down by 9 per cent.
Higher volumes partly offset this effect but the rising Australian dollar
diminished their impact.
MIM is paying a final dividend of 2.5 cents a share, after a similar
interim.

Attributable earnings for the 12 months to June rose by 81 per cent to R512m

Turnover for the year rose 9 per cent to R9.82bn. Iscor also reported a

Net debt dropped R401m to R1.72bn from R2.1bn while the debt/equity ratio

Mr Hans Smith, managing director, said a 6.4 per cent increase in local
sales volumes had fuelled the rise. He also noted that the decline in the
rand/dollar exchange rate had combined with an improved steel price to
increase export earnings.
Mr Smith said overall costs had been reduced and capital expenditure had
fallen 20 per cent to R498m, from R622m.

FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: UK building society to
securitise mortgages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bristol &amp; West Building Society, the UK's 10th largest, is set to launch a
commercial mortgage securitisation, the first by a UK society.
It intends to issue about Pounds 150m of listed bonds, equivalent to
approximately 17 per cent of its commercial mortgage book, to help fund its
commercial property lending business.
Bristol &amp; West and Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank involved in setting
up the deal, were unable to comment yesterday on the details and terms of
the issue, which are expected to be announced next month.
However, Goldman Sachs said the issue was likely to be of floating-rate
notes, involving senior and sub-ordinated tranches.
The move was welcomed by industry analysts. 'This particular transaction is
an excellent prelude to the development of the securitisation market in the
UK for building societies,' said Mr Rick Abbott, director responsible for
securitisation at Morgan Grenfell.
Securitisation is common in the US but is still at an early stage of
development in the UK. It allows financial institutions to take loans off
their balance sheets, removing the risk of default and freeing capital.
Bristol &amp; West will place the commercial mortgages in a special-purpose
vehicle which will sell the debt securities to investors. Interest on the
'mortgage-backed' securities will be funded by the loan repayments.
Earlier this year, the Building Societies Commission issued draft guidance
on securitisation, and in May, the Leeds Permanent Building Society raised
Pounds 100m through a type of securitisation, based on residential
mortgages. However, instead of selling securities in the public market, the
Leeds used a pool of mortgages as collateral for a loan from a group of
banks.
Other lenders, such as The Mortgage Corporation, have made extensive use of
securitisation to fund their residential mortgage books, although activity
has died down in recent years due to the weakness of the housing market.
Bristol &amp; West said yesterday it had no plans to securitise residential
mortgages.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Television Broadcasts, Hong Kong's premier television company, yesterday
surprised the stock market when it reported a 70 per cent increase in
first-half net earnings to HKDollars 278m (USDollars 36m) from HKDollars
163.5m.
The higher-than-expected profits at TVB were struck on turnover up nearly 36
per cent to HKDollars 1.18bn from HKDollars 871m in the previous half.
Earnings per share of 66 cents were nearly 70 per cent up on last year.
The company said it had experienced strong growth in demand for advertising
airtime and cited advertising directed at property investment in China as
one of the main forces behind this.
TVB is seen as one of the strongest media companies in Asia. Recently
Pearson, the UK group which publishes the Financial Times, entered
negotiations to acquire 10 per cent of TVB. These have since stalled.
Mr Lau Siu-chuen, media analyst at Morgan Stanley, said there were a number
of special factors which helped boost profits in the first half compared
with a year earlier.
The most important of these was a change in the Hong Kong government's
advertising royalties. A year ago the government took 12 per cent of TVB's
advertising revenues but now takes 10 per cent. TVB, as with all other Hong
Kong companies, has also benefited from a 1 percentage point cut in the
corporate rate.
Mr Lau said he was holding to his full-year profits forecast of HKDollars
626.5m. Lehman Brothers revised its expectations to HKDollars 732m from
HKDollars 630m.
Sir Run Run Shaw, executive chairman, said he expected satisfactory growth
in profits for the remainder of the year.
Directors declared an interim dividend of 20 cents a share, up 33 per cent
on the corresponding period last year.

The billionaire US investor Mr John Kluge yesterday unveiled a four-company
merger between his privately-owned international telecommunications group
Metromedia, the Hollywood studio Orion Pictures, the film and television
production group MCEG Sterling, and Actava, a cash-rich conglomerate.
The new company will be called Metromedia International. Mr Kluge, who
rescued Orion from bankruptcy last year, said yesterday: 'Our vision is to
create a new global media, entertainment and communications company.'
Actava, which after recent divestments has Dollars 215m in cash and liquid
securities on hand, will provide the capital for the new entity. Orion and
MCEG Sterling will produce new entertainment programming and provide a film
library of more than 1,000 titles (including Oscar-winning movies such as
Silence of the Lambs and Dances with Wolves).
Metromedia will contribute the delivery mechanism via its international
telecommunications systems.
Initially, the new company will focus on delivering entertainment
programming to overseas markets.
Mr Kluge will be chairman of the new company, and Mr Jack Phillips, a
telecommunications industry executive who was chief executive of Actava,
will be president.
The creation of the new company is the latest evidence of how
telecommunications and entertainment are converging.
Companies in both industries are eager to exploit technological developments
and regulatory reform that will allow films and other entertainment and
educational programming to be delivered to customers via phone lines.

<TEXT>
Mr Rand Araskog, chairman of ITT, the US conglomerate, may be able to reward
himself with a weekend at the famous Gritti Palace hotel in Venice this
autumn. But he has probably not yet made his reservation.
Seven months attempting to gain control of Ciga, the Italian hotels group
which owns the Gritti, have taught Mr Araskog that when it comes to Italian
takeover bids - even those agreed by the target company - it is best not to
plan too far ahead.
Under the control of Fimpar, the Aga Khan's holding company, Ciga
accumulated borrowings of about L1,000bn (Dollars 628m) by the end of 1992,
and at the beginning of last year asked Mediobanca, the powerful Milan
merchant bank, to study plans to cut its borrowings.
Forte of the UK stepped in with a rescue plan last autumn, before Host
Marriott of the US and ITT, which owns the Sheraton hotel chain, tabled
rival bids.
In February, ITT appeared to have outbid Forte for the right to buy Ciga.
Since then, however, a combination of bad judgment and bad luck has forced
ITT to abandon its original plan and start again, laboriously building a
stake in Ciga to the point at which it is now poised to launch a second
formal bid for the loss-making company.
This being an Italian bid, nothing is official. From its New York base, ITT
will say only that it is complying with Italian takeover regulations and
will make a statement when appropriate.
Consob, the Italian stock exchange authority and takeover watchdog, has
issued no official communique.
A terse statement in July, welcoming the appointment of ITT/Sheraton
directors to the Ciga board, is the nearest Mr Araskog himself has come to
acknowledging that hotels like the Gritti, the Meurice in Paris and the
Principe di Savoia in Milan are within his grasp.
However, sources confirm that ITT plans to launch a formal bid for 35.25 per
cent of Ciga, at a price of about L1,100 a share.
The offer will probably have to be made by September 16, the start of the
next Milan stock exchange trading account.
Under Italian stock exchange rules, ITT must bid at least the average price
it paid for Ciga shares accumulated on the market.
If successful, the bid will double the US company's stake in Ciga to just
over 70 per cent, and cost ITT a further L400bn on top of the L400bn or so
the company has already spent buying its existing 35 per cent holding.
The offer price is nearly 50 per cent higher than ITT's original
unsuccessful bid, but it is not enough for a hard core of the company's
vociferous minority shareholders.
Some have already said they are unhappy with the small premium to the
current market price of about L1,080 and will reject such an offer.
Their continued presence on the Ciga shareholder register would be a mixed
blessing for ITT. Although the US group only needs 51 per cent of the
company, it has already seen how determined Italian investors can upset
carefully laid plans.
In April, ITT was forced to abandon its original hope of acquiring Ciga
through a complex financial manoeuvre masterminded by Mediobanca.
A deliberately overpriced rights issue was supposed to fail, delivering Ciga
into the hands of its creditor banks and thence to ITT for the equivalent of
L740 a share. In preparation for takeover, a team of ITT/Sheraton executives
came to Italy to start examining the real state of Ciga's assets.
Unfortunately for ITT and Mediobanca, investors snapped up the issue of
shares. An angry and embarrassed ITT withdrew its management team, claiming
that more than L300bn of capital investment was needed to bring the Ciga
hotels up to a satisfactory standard.
ITT continued to buy shares in the company, however, although the tactics
this time were much less aggressive. At a stormy shareholder meeting in
early July, the Aga Khan's management of the company was fiercely
criticised.
It was agreed by the seven-strong board that three directors would step down
to be replaced by ITT-Sheraton nominees. As a result, Consob decided the US
group effectively controlled Ciga, even though it directly owned less than
20 per cent of the group.
Italian investment funds which took stakes in Ciga during or just after the
capital increase are happy that the hotels group will be managed by
ITT-Sheraton, but some are upset about the way in which ITT has gone about
the takeover.
Although the funds claim they are long-term investors, they see the Italian
group, now it is recapitalised, as a valuable play on real estate values,
worth more than L1,200 a share. 'For an international company coming into
the Italian market for the first time, they could be a bit more generous,'
says one fund manager.
In addition, some investors were irritated by the way in which ITT brought
its stake up to 35 per cent in August, sweeping up shares on the market
while there was still uncertainty about the terms of a future bid.
ITT is now said to have lodged its formal offer with Consob, making further
purchases illegal, but the US company's earlier forays into the market were
within Italian rules.
In any case, in spite of bid speculation, the Ciga share price rarely
exceeded L1,100 during August.
In ITT's defence, Mr Araskog could point out that only a foolish traveller
offers to pay more than the advertised rate for a suite at the Gritti
Palace.

FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: Banco Santander sells 1.47%
Banesto stake
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Banco Santander has sold 1.47 per cent of Banesto, the troubled bank it took
over earlier this year, to La Caixa, the Barcelona-based savings bank. The
deal could foreshadow wider agreements between the two leading domestic
financial institutions.
La Caixa, which paid Pta7.4bn (Dollars 57.4m) for the stake, said the
acquisition, an unprecedented investment by a savings institution in a
leading commercial bank, was a 'purely financial investment'. It rejected
speculation that it formed part of a 'non-aggression pact' with Santander.
The savings bank paid Pta830 per Banesto share, well below the average
trading price during August of more than Pta1,000 for Banesto stock.
Santander had paid Pta762 per Banesto share when it took control of the bank
in April.
It emerged, however, that the purchase, which makes the savings bank
Banesto's fourth largest shareholder, coincided with a Pta13.6bn sale by La
Caixa to Santander in early August of 0.7 per cent of its equity in
Telefonica, the national telecommunications company.
La Caixa, ranked second after Italy's Cariplo among European savings banks,
earned Pta5bn in capital gains from its Telefonica share sale to Santander.
The disposal lowered La Caixa's equity in Telefonica to 1.3 per cent
although it remains one of its largest individual shareholders.
Market sources believe that there could be further deals between La Caixa
and Santander, which has become Spain's leading commercial bank after its
takeover of Banesto.
Santander now holds 68.4 per cent of Banesto and intends to cut this to
about 50 per cent.

FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: Seagram climbs 32% to Dollars
224m in second term

A strong contribution from 24.5 per cent-owned Du Pont, the US chemicals
group, lifted Seagram's second-quarter net profit by 32 per cent to
USDollars 224m, or 60 cents a share, from Dollars 170m, or 46 cents, a year
earlier.
Seagram, one of the world's top three drinks groups, said its revenues from
beverage operations rose 2 per cent to USDollars 1.45bn, with good gains at
Tropicana, the fast-expanding juice unit, offsetting a modest decline in
spirits and wines.
Tropicana achieved a 41 per cent share of the US ready-to-serve orange juice
market, up from 37 per cent a year earlier.
Beverage operating income overall was Dollars 144m, down Dollars 14m, partly
due to exchange factors. Latin American markets were weak, especially in
Venezuela, but US spirits sales staged a turnround, with a strong
contribution from Seagram's new vodka brand.
Mr Edgar Bronfman Jr, president, estimated that fiscal 1995 spirits and
wines operating income will exceed the fiscal 1994 level of Dollars 666m.
Seagram's share of Du Pont's unremitted earnings jumped to Dollars 117m,
against Dollars 51m, and dividend income was Dollars 77m, compared with
Dollars 74m. Du Pont has been reporting higher profits with a strong
recovery in chemical prices, especially in the US.
Seagram's overall first half earnings were Dollars 346m, or 93 cents, up
from Dollars 332m, or 89 cents, a year earlier, while beverage revenues
totalled Dollars 2.7bn, up from Dollars 2.6bn. The share of Du Pont profit
was Dollars 198m, against Dollars 98m, and dividend income was Dollars 153m,
against Dollars 146m.
The quarterly dividend is being raised to 15 cents from 14 cents with the
September 30 payment.
Seagram also owns almost 15 per cent of Time-Warner, the US communications
giant.

FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: Bols Wessanen slips 7.9%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bols Wessanen, the Dutch food and beverages group, blamed a downturn in its
beverages activities for a 7.9 per cent decline in first-half net profit to
Fl 110.2m (USDollars 63.0m), from Fl 119.6m a year earlier.
It said the decline was partly due to poor weather during the second quarter
in Italy. In the Netherlands its profits from spirits fell because of an
increase in excise duties.
Group turnover rose by 6.4 per cent to Fl 2.66bn, with most of the increase
due to acquisitions, but operating profit fell by 3.6 per cent to Fl 66.8m.
In spite of the first-half decline, which caused the company's shares to
fall nearly 10 per cent on the Amsterdam stock exchange yesterday, Bols
Wessanen predicted that full-year net earnings per share, excluding
extraordinary items, would at least match the 1993 figure.

<TEXT>
VNU, the Dutch publishing group, saw net profit rise by 32 per cent to Fl
79m (Dollars 45.2m) in the first half, helped by acquisitions, cost-cutting
and economic recovery in some markets.
Operating profit rose by 20 per cent to Fl 144m, matching the rate of
increase in turnover, which rose to Fl 1.27bn from Fl 1.06bn.
Acquisitions, including the purchase of BPI Communications of the US,
publisher of Billboard and other magazines, accounted for slightly more than
half of the turnover increase.
Net profit expanded more sharply than operating profit because of lower
interest charges and lower taxes.
VNU said its Dutch and Belgian commercial television activities benefited
from increased demand for brand advertising. In the UK, where VNU publishes
trade and business magazines, the company reported a strong market recovery.
The Dutch company took a Fl 20m charge against operating profits at its US
business information group to reflect more conservative valuations of both
capitalised software and database costs.
In January, VNU announced a Dollars 220m US deal giving it control over two
'bibles' of the West Coast entertainment industry, the daily newspaper
Hollywood Reporter and Billboard. It also took over 17 other US trade
magazines.

<TEXT>
Assurances Generales de France, the French insurance group which is a
candidate for privatisation, yesterday announced a fall in net profits to
FFr1.04bn (Dollars 192m) for the first half of 1994 from FFr1.41bn in the
same period last year.
However, Mr Antoine Jeancourt-Galignani, chairman, said AGF was on course
for an increase in net profits for the full year to between FFr1.46bn and
FFr1.7bn. This compares with net profits of FFr977m in 1993.
'We're extremely cautious,' he said. 'But our forecast at the moment is that
profits for the full financial year will be 40 per cent to 60 per cent
higher than those for the first half.'
Mr Jeancourt-Galignani also stressed that AGF would be ready for
privatisation by the end of September, the deadline set earlier this year
when the Balladur government outlined its privatisation plans.
The government has since appeared cooler about the prospect of selling its
AGF shares, in favour of concentrating on the proposed partial privatisation
of the Renault motor group.
AGF has made no secret of its hopes that the sale will go ahead this autumn.
'It's up to the government to take the decision,' said Mr
Jeancourt-Galignani.
Meanwhile AGF is reorganising its assets.
Mr Jeancourt-Galignani confirmed it intended to sell a 43 per cent stake in
Banque Francaise du Commerce Exterieur, which is held jointly with the
Credit Lyonnais banking group.
He also affirmed that AGF had begun talks with Suez, the French holding
company, to acquire the latter's 26.7 per cent holding in SFAC, a credit
insurance concern.
AGF already owns 45 per cent of SFAC and hopes to take control.
Mr Jeancourt-Galignani declined to comment, however, on the progress of
talks for AGF to raise its stake in AMB, the German insurance company of
which it now owns 33.5 per cent.
AMB doubled its contribution to AGF's interim figures, providing net profits
of FFr106m, against FFr54m in the first half of last year.

FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: Ciba result undermined by
financial factors

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ciba, the Swiss pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, reported unchanged
first-half net income of SFr1.4bn (Dollars 1.05bn), as unfavourable currency
and financial factors undermined a 'creditable' operating result.
Mr Alex Krauer, chairman, forecast that net income in the full year would be
comparable to last year's SFr1.78bn.
First-half sales were down 2 per cent to SFr11.64bn, but operating income
rose 3 per cent to SFr2bn. Ciba said operating profits expressed in local
currencies jumped by 19 per cent, with two-thirds of the growth coming from
better margins and the remainder from expense control.
However, the group's financial income, based on liquid funds of SFr7.2bn at
the end of last year, plunged 30 per cent to SFr199m, largely because of the
decline in market values of many investments.
The group's currency hedging activity also suffered, swinging from a SFr44m
profit to a SFr61m loss. Ciba said it had been able to compensate partially
through hedging the rise in the Swiss franc's value, but the cost was high.
Sales in the healthcare division were down 2 per cent to SFr4.24bn, but up 3
per cent in local currencies. Pharmaceutical sales were flat at SFr2.9bn,
hurt by pressures from governments to cut prices. Generic competition for
the leading anti-rheumatic drug Voltaren should start to have an impact in
the second half.
However, sales of Ciba Vision, which is acquiring the ophthalmic drugs
business of Johnson &amp; Johnson, advanced 6 per cent to SFr530m.
The self-medication division, following the acquisition of Fisons products,
raised its sales by 3 per cent to SFr485m, 10 per cent in local currencies.
The agriculture sector also reported a 2 per cent decline in sales to
SFr3.02bn, a 3 per cent rise in local currencies.

FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: Cost-cutting helps Pharmacia to
half-time profits of SKr2.66bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmacia, the newly-privatised Swedish drugs group, yesterday reported a
better-than-expected profit of SKr2.66bn (Dollars 343m) for the first six
months as sales reached SKr13.7bn.
The group said it was difficult to compare its figures with the same 1993
period because of the acquisition of the Italian pharmaceuticals group
Farmitalia Carlo Erba (FICE) in May 1993.
If FICE is included on a pro-forma basis from January 1 1993, underlying
sales were 4 per cent higher than a year ago and underlying operating
profits were 25 per cent higher at SKr2.76bn. The group said the main reason
for the improvement was cost-cutting.
The company said its operating margin for the 12 months to June 30 was 16.5
per cent, compared with 14.7 per cent for the whole of last year. It is
looking for savings of SKr1.2bn by 1996 to achieve an operating margin of 20
per cent.
Sales of the group's two main drugs, Genotropin (growth hormones) and Healon
(cataract surgery) both fell slightly. It blamed restrictions on healthcare
spending in Spain and Australia for the 1 per cent decline in Genotropin
sales to SKr1.3bn. Healon sales were also 1 per cent lower at SKr797m due to
fewer surgical operations in the US.
Although sales in the Swedish market fell 7 per cent to SKr967m, sales in
Japan, the group's most important market, rose 15 per cent to SKr2.2bn.
The Swedish government sold most of its shares in Pharmacia in June but has
retained a minority 12 per cent stake to provide the group with ownership
stability ahead of Volvo's planned divestment of its 28 per cent stake in
the company in 1996.

with US deal

<TEXT>
Swiss Bank Corporation, Switzerland's third largest bank, is acquiring
Brinson Partners, a leading US investment management firm, as part of its
strategy for building up a global institutional asset management business.
SBC said in Zurich yesterday it would charge Dollars 750m against its
capital reserves for the purchase, although the final cost would depend on
the performance of Brinson over at least seven years. It had pre-tax profits
of Dollars 35m last year.
The Chicago based Brinson, with assets under management of Dollars 36bn and
a staff of 233, is the second big US acquisition made by SBC in the past two
years. In 1992, it bought the business of the O'Conner Partnerships, also of
Chicago and specialised in the use of futures, options and other so-called
derivative products in investment risk management.
Mr Marcel Ospel, global markets director, said acquisition was the only
practical way for a big Swiss bank to keep pace in sectors that were
developing quickly elsewhere, particularly in the US.
SBC would integrate its own institutional asset management business with
that of Brinson in a new division under the direction of Mr Gary Brinson.
Together, they would manage some Dollars 65bn.
The bank said Brinson, formerly First Chicago Investment Advisors, pioneered
active management of global portfolios for US clients in the early 1980s. It
has built up a strong position in the US but wants to extend its reach
throughout the world.
As part of the acquisition, SBC would take over Brinson's 1991 joint venture
with Yasuda Fire &amp; Marine Insurance of Japan.
Mr Georges Blum, SBC chief executive, said Brinson would 'reinforce the
share of stable and sustainable income streams' of the bank, a remark that
appeared aimed partly at responding to recent criticism of its earnings
volatility.
In the first half of 1993, profits before taxes and provisions plunged 45
per cent to SFr1.2bn (Dollars 900m) mainly due to a 63 per cent slide in
trading income.
Mr Blum said the directors had reassessed their strategy but decided to make
no changes in the light of the disappointing results.
'We are out to achieve as broad a diversification as possible in our income
streams,' he said. For the first time, he revealed a breakdown of operating
income by division. The Swiss domestic division made SFr2.36bn, 70 per cent
of the total, while the international and finance division contributed
SFr899m.

FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: Sharp turnround for Daimler-Benz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Daimler-Benz, the German automotive and aerospace group, achieved a DM3.3bn
(Dollars 2.1bn) turnround in its operating performance in the first half
with an operating profit of DM926m, compared with an operating loss of
DM2.4bn in the same period a year ago.
Mr Edzard Reuter, chairman of the management board, said the group would
achieve 'a thoroughly satisfactory operating profit' for the full year, and
forecast that 'almost all' operations should have returned to profit by
1995.
Around DM650m of the improvement came from the sale of a majority stake in
Mercedes-Benz Leasing to German banks.
Daimler-Benz net profits under US accounting standards totalled DM369m in
the first half compared with a net loss of DM949m a year ago, while earnings
per share on the same basis recovered to DM7.82 from a loss of DM20.37 per
share a year ago.
Under German accounting rules net profits nearly tripled to DM462m from
DM168m on a group turnover which rose by 13.4 per cent to DM48.96bn from
DM43.19bn.
Mr Reuter said the group was concerned by 'the inexplicably weak rate' of
the US dollar against other leading trading currencies, and in particular
against the D-Mark.
The turnround follows a drastic restructuring programme begun in the second
half of 1992 which includes the cutting of 78,000 jobs by the end of 1995.
The recovery in the first half has been helped by severe measures to cut
costs, boost productivity and rationalise operations, but it has also been
supported by an improvement in the fortunes of the Mercedes-Benz executive
and luxury car operations, due chiefly to the successful launch a year ago
of the new C-Class executive car range.
Car production in the period jumped by 44.3 per cent to 302,076, while car
sales volumes rose 40.3 per cent to 296,770 and turnover rose by 22.8 per
cent to DM21.2bn.
Mr Reuter forecast that the volume of car sales in the full year would rise
by around 15 per cent to 585,000. The car operations were currently working
'to the limit of our technical capacity' in most areas, he said. The group's
E-Class luxury car would be replaced in mid-1995.
The turnover of Deutsche Aerospace, which is cutting 10,000 jobs and closing
6 plants, declined by 5.6 per cent to DM7.2bn and for the full year was
expected to be unchanged, said Mr Reuter.

<TEXT>
Skanska, the Swedish construction and property group, yesterday reported a
30 per cent rise in first-half pre-tax profits to SKr1.52bn (Dollars 196m).
The rise came in spite of a weaker Swedish construction market and was
achieved due to lower net interest costs, reduced exchange losses on loans
and increased income from dividends.
Operating profit before financial items was SKr1.32bn, after including a
SKr234m gain on the sale of investment and development properties. The
figure was 7 per cent lower than a year ago when operating profits of
SKr1.43bn included a SKr37m gain from property sales.
The group has already exceeded the SKr1.12bn profit it reported for the
whole of 1993. Its second-half figures will include SKr880m in revenues
following the winding-up of Protorp, the investment company.
Revenues climbed to SKr14.9bn from SKr14bn. However, the group relied on a
strong expansion of its international construction business, where revenues
climbed to SKr3.9bn from SKr2.4bn, to offset the downturn in domestic
construction, where revenues fell to SKr6.7bn from SKr7.4bn.

<TEXT>
Astra, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, yesterday announced a 23 per cent
jump in first-half profits to SKr4.50bn (Dollars 581m), with strong sales
growth more than compensating for a sharp drop in financial income.
The group said sales and earnings would continue to rise in the second half,
although it warned that growth would be slower than last year because of a
less favourable currency influence.
Underlying sales were 23 per cent higher at SKr13.3bn, enabling the group to
take further market share in its most important markets.
Star performer was the anti-ulcer drug, Losec, which lifted sales by 41 per
cent, compared with market growth of around 10 per cent. Overall, Losec
sales reached SKr8.14bn, up 47 per cent.
Losec, the main challenger to Glaxo's Zantac, has around 35 per cent of the
European market and is the top-selling drug in both France and Germany.
Astra says it has preliminary indications that Losec may even have overtaken
Zantac in the UK market. The drug has a US market share of around 17 per
cent.
Pulmicort, the anti-asthma agent, increased sales by 29 per cent to
SKr1.77bn, helped by the launch of the group's Pulmicort Turbuhaler in
Germany this year.
Group operating earnings grew 37 per cent to SKr4.42bn but the full impact
was not felt at the bottom line because of a sharp drop in financial income
to SKr85m from SKr392m.
The group said it suffered up to SKr150m in unrealised losses on its bond
portfolio while capital expenditure rose sharply to SKr3.3bn from SKr1.2bn.
Among other investments, the group strengthened its position in Japan by
lifting its stake in a joint venture with Fujisawa to 90 per cent.
Sales in Germany, the group's main market, climbed 27 per cent in local
currencies, against estimated market growth of 5 per cent. The company said
Losec's German sales had not been affected by a domestic scare surrounding
an injectable form of the drug.
Analysts expect full-year profits of between SKr9.5bn and SKr10bn, compared
with SKr7.8bn last year.

<TEXT>
Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL), one of the big three Belgian banks,
yesterday an-nounced a 26 per cent rise in consolidated net profits for the
first half-year, of BFr3.85bn (Dollars 118m) against BFr3.05bn in the first
half of 1993.
Announcing the result, Mr Daniel Cardon de Lichtbuer, chief executive, said
that BBL's 'battle is won,' after the black year of 1992.
BBL cut its dividend in 1992 after having to make heavy provisions for bad
loans, and a bid to link up with Internationale Nederlanden Groep, the Dutch
financial services group, collapsed.
Since then, there has been a clean-out of the foreign network's loan
portfolio, where most of the bad debts were lodged, and a much more rigorous
assessment of credit risk, especially in lending to the private sector.
BBL earned a BFr392m profit from its European subsidiaries in the first
half, against losses for the whole of last year of BFr942m. Private sector
loans, meanwhile, rose only 3 per cent in the first six months of 1994,
compared with a 12 per cent increase in lending to the public sector.
Provisions for loans and investments fell 28 per cent to BFr4.47bn, against
BFr6.21bn in the first half of last year.
Mr Cardon expected similar earnings in the second half, and total provisions
for the year of the order of BFr5bn, half 1992 levels.

Stadshypotek, Sweden's largest mortgage credit institute, yesterday launched

The offer is being made to 760,000 borrowers who will be eligible, according
to the size of their mortgages, to subscribe for shares at a price of SKr80
per share. They will also receive one matching share free for every share
they buy from Stadshypotekskassan (the Urban Mortgage Bank), the trustee

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Clear evidence of a strong upturn in the pulp and paper cycle emerged
yesterday when two of Sweden's leading forestry groups, SCA and MoDo,
reported a sharp increase in first half profits.
SCA said profits after financial items had risen to SKr818m (Dollars 105.7m)
from SKr550m, excluding one-off items.
MoDo returned to the black, swinging to a SKr471m profit after financial
items from SKr319m loss a year ago.
Both companies said they were feeling the effects of increased volumes and
lower financial costs. MoDo also highlighted a sharp upturn in prices for
pulp, fine paper and sawn goods as the basis for its turnround.
SCA upgraded its full-year forecast, saying it now expected profits of
between SKr1.9bn to SKr2.3bn.
MoDo saw sales climb 12 per cent to SKr9.4bn, mainly because of higher
volumes and increased prices for pulp and fine paper.
The operating result climbed sharply to SKr909m from SKr277m.
All the group's units reported higher operating profits. MoDo Paper, the
fine paper division, swung to SKr127m profit from a SKr202m loss while
Iggesund Paperboard saw profits rise to SKr332m from SKr156m. Group
financial costs fell to SKr438m from SKr596m.
The company says full-year profits will comfortably exceed SKr1bn.

FT  01 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Cairn falls 35% as oil price dips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Low oil prices hit Cairn Energy, the Edinburgh-based oil and gas explorer
which yesterday announced a 35 per cent drop in interim net attributable
profits to Pounds 415,000, compared with Pounds 641,000.
A 19 per cent decline in the average price of oil per barrel to Dollars
13.54 offset the benefits of a rise in production. Turnover increased by 2
per cent to Pounds 8.4m, while production rose by 370 barrels of oil
equivalent per day to 4,936.
The results included a three-month contribution from the on-shore assets
acquired from Kelt Energy for Pounds 6.7m.
Earnings were 0.64p (1.21p) and there is no dividend.
It is proposed to dispose of a further stake in Cairn Energy USA, the US
subsidiary, to raise a net Pounds 17.5m.
The UK group has over the last year been steadily selling shares in the US
company to raise funds for exploration and to reduce debt. Including the
proposed disposal, the group will have raised Pounds 33m from the share
sales and issues since June 1993.
Cairn is proposing to sell 3.7m shares in CEUSA, reducing its holding from
54 per cent to 17.9 per cent. The resulting stake would be worth some Pounds
15m.
Mr Bill Gammell, chief executive, said the group intended to use the
proceeds of the sale to increase its production and reserve base outside the
US.

Pounds 2.6m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Beckenham Group, the USM-quoted heating and ventilation engineer which has
recently undergone a capital reconstruction, reported a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 2.6m for the six months to April 30.
The deficit, which compared with losses of Pounds 186,000 last time,
reflected 'continuing difficult trading conditions, the heavy cost of
completing long-standing contract commitments, and damage inflicted by the
financial crisis the group has experienced', the directors said.
Turnover fell from Pounds 17.4m to Pounds 13.4m and the pre-tax result was
struck after an increased interest charge of Pounds 174,000 (Pounds
112,000). Losses per share emerged at 12.9p (3p).
The company also announced it had sold its Contract Components subsidiary to
Simco 651 for Pounds 2.5m cash.
The sale would enable the group to concentrate its resources on the core
ductwork businesses and to develop its fire protection activities.
It was also necessary to maintain the company's working capital and reduce
indebtedness, directors said.

FT  01 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Ropner improves 22% despite mixed showing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ropner yesterday announced a 22 per cent expansion in interim profits
despite a mixed performance by its property investment, engineering and
shipping activities.
On turnover up 33 per cent to Pounds 12m, the pre-tax line for the six
months to June 30 rose to Pounds 1.99m, against Pounds 1.63m.
Mr Jeremy Ropner, chairman, warned, however, that it would be 'unrealistic
to expect the second half to show the same degree of improvement'.
The property division performed well, he said, reflecting improved values at
the start of the year. Two properties were sold for Pounds 3.03m, some
Pounds 660,000 above book value. The shipping side, which currently manages
seven bulk carriers, lifted profits by 13 per cent to Pounds 899,000.
A dull spot was engineering, where demand had been irregular. 'We have
suffered from significant fluctuations and have had to make some hard
decisions,' Mr Ropner said.
The interim dividend is held at 3.5p on capital increased following the
enfranchisement of the A capital. Earnings per share were 5.2p (4.2p).

FT  01 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Psion more than doubled at Pounds 2.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Psion, the supplier of hand-held computers and communications equipment,
maintained its recovery with profits more than doubled at the halfway stage.
The pre-tax outcome for the six months to end-June was Pounds 2.92m, against
Pounds 1.07m, achieved on turnover ahead 57 per cent at Pounds 28.3m (Pounds
18.1m). Earnings per share were 8.65p (3.41p); the interim dividend goes up
10 per cent to 1.1p.
The results were above market expectations and the shares improved 11p to
close at 285p.
Psion makes a range of hand-held computers, including the Series 3 family,
aimed chiefly at consumer markets and the HC range for corporate use.
Mr David Potter, chairman, said each product area had shown good growth.
Sales of the Series 3 and 3a jumped to Pounds 16.7m (Pounds 8.15m) while
sales of HC products almost doubled at Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 1.88m).
The older and cheaper Organiser II products saw sales decline just 15 per
cent to Pounds 4.05m. The datacommunications division turned over Pounds
3.69m (Pounds 2m). Psion is a leader in credit-card sized modems  - devices
used to allow computers to communicate over telephone lines.
Mr Potter said the company now had 1,500 retail outlets in the US including
Radio Shack and Office Depot. The market had been adversely affected by the
relative failure of other manufacturers' 'personal digital assistants' using
pen-based technology, however, and an advertising campaign aimed at
establishing brand awareness was planned.
Psion has cash of Pounds 842,000 and Mr Potter did not anticipate having to
raise additional funds in the foreseeable future.

FT  01 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Serco buoyed by organic growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of Serco firmed 14p to 297p yesterday as the facilities and contract
management group reported sharp organic growth within a 38 per cent interim
profits advance.
Turnover rose 46 per cent to Pounds 120m (Pounds 82.3m), with substantial
new business gains helping existing operations expand sales by 21 per cent.
The pre-tax outcome increased from Pounds 4.35m to Pounds 6m, although 17
per cent of the increase came from three companies acquired in the second
half of 1993.
Mr Richard White, chief executive, said: 'We see the trend we've set for
organic growth being maintained.'
Defence continues to account for close to 30 per cent of sales, and Mr White
said there was substantial scope for new contracts, as the Ministry of
Defence continues its efficiency drive by contracting out to the private
sector.
Serco recently won the MoD contract for air traffic control at Gibraltar
airport, in addition to winning the civil contract for a range of services
at Liverpool airport.
Other new business included a new contract for maintenance of London's
traffic signals, giving Serco maintenance responsibility for two thirds of
the the capital's junctions. It also won a contract from Yorkshire Water for
maintenance of its vehicles.
When Serco was listed, 10 per cent of its staff worked overseas. The figure
is now closer to 30 per cent, as it has expanded primarily in the US and
Asia Pacific, and is currently targeting Scandinavia and Germany.
Serco operates primarily under fixed rate contracts, of which about half are
linked to an inflation index.
It remains sensitive to increases in wages, however, which form its largest
cost.
Mr White said there were signs of increasing pressure on salaries, but he
said that this was being factored into contract tenders.
Serco is paying a 1.25p interim dividend, an increase of 18 per cent.
Earnings per share rose 25 per cent to 5.6p (4.5p).

Spring Ram, the Yorkshire-based kitchen, bathrooms and furniture group, is
to close its lossmaking Artisan Tile factory in Bradford.
The new management, appointed after institutional investors forced a
boardroom shake-out last year, said intense price competition from imports
was likely to prolong the losses at Artisan, which started production in
1992 and lost Pounds 1m in the last six months. It employs 95 people, but
the group hopes to redeploy about 30 of the workforce.
An exceptional charge of Pounds 2.5m for the closure pushed Spring Ram to a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.1m for the six months to July 2. This compared with
losses of Pounds 34.4m last time, which included Pounds 30.3m of write-offs
and charges.
The group incurred an operating profit of Pounds 2.2m, compared with losses
of Pounds 4.8m. Sales rose by 11 per cent to Pounds 18m.
Mr Roger Regan, chairman, said: 'The deflationary pricing conditions both in
our home and international markets and in the UK economy as a whole, coupled
with the first signs of increased raw material prices, make internal
improvements in efficiency and productivity all important.'
Spring Ram's kitchen division, its biggest and most profitable business,
increased sales by 8.5 per cent to Pounds 62.6m, and operating profits rose
from Pounds 4.7m to Pounds 6m. After a good first quarter for the division
as a whole, the rate of sales growth in the UK home improvement market was
checked in the second half of May and June.
Sales in the bathroom division fell to Pounds 28.3m (Pounds 29.7m), but the
elimination of lossmaking activities enabled the division to report
operating profits of Pounds 100,000, compared with a loss of Pounds 3.2m
last time.
The special products division, which includes Artisan, increased sales from
Pounds 14.9m to Pounds 21.5m and cut operating losses from Pounds 7.1m to
Pounds 4.7m. Turnover rose at Regency Doors, while operating losses fell.
Stag, the group's furniture business, increased sales by 21 per cent to
Pounds 15.8m. Operating profits remained static at Pounds 800,000 as the
group invested in new products for its living and dining room ranges.
Losses per share were 0.3p, compared with losses of 10.4p last time.
COMMENT
The new team at Spring Ram continues to make progress, but the sluggish
trading environment and costlier raw materials mean they face a hard slog.
Closure of Artisan will disappoint, but the losses could scarcely be
maintained - the whole venture will have cost the group Pounds 9.5m since
start-up, including the latest Pounds 2.5m exceptional charge. Analysts
expect operating profits of about Pounds 6m this year, but all eyes are on
1995 and 1996 when profits could bounce back to Pounds 18m and more than
Pounds 30m respectively. The shares, down 1 1/2 p to 51p, are on a sky-high
multiple of 36 this year, but that falls to 16 for 1995 and below 10 for
1996. They remain an attractive recovery play.

FT  01 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Domnick Hunter advances to Pounds 2.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Domnick Hunter group, the filtration and gas separation company floated in
March, increased pre-tax profits by 29 per cent to Pounds 2.6m in the six
months to June 30.
The results, coupled with an upbeat trading statement, bolstered the
Tyneside-based group's status as one of the most attractive of recent
flotations. The shares, launched at 200p, yesterday closed 10p higher at
260p.
Sales rose by 17 per cent to Pounds 17.7m. The pre-tax figure was flattered
by reduced interest charges after flotation; the underlying performance
showed in operating profits, ahead 21 per cent at Pounds 2.72m.
Mr Brian Thompson, executive chairman, said: 'A strong level of orders and
sales continues into the second half and there is every indication that this
situation should prevail for the remainder of the year.'
The industrial division, which makes dryers and filters for compressed air
and gases, benefited from an uplift in market confidence. In particular,
sales of compressed air dryers were strong. Operating profit rose 27 per
cent to Pounds 2.67m, on sales of Pounds 13.5m, up 18 per cent.
Mr Thompson said the group's new nitrogen generators were attracting
'tremendous' interest. Sales increased by 50 per cent to Pounds 660,000 and
there was 'huge' scope for the generators, which produce nitrogen gas from
compressed air at a fraction of the cost of cylinder supplies. A Pounds 2.5m
extension to the industrial division's Birtley plant will increase space by
50 per cent.
He said the process division - which filters pharmaceuticals and liquids
using sophisticated membranes - was still in the evolutionary phase of its
development. Sales rose 14 per cent to Pounds 4.2m, but investment in an
overseas sales network was behind a fall in operating profits from Pounds
151,000 to Pounds 51,000.
Fully-diluted earnings per share improved to 3.8p (3.02p). A special interim
dividend of 1p is declared for the three-month period since listing.
COMMENT
Analysts love this company, which attracts plaudits such as 'a little gem'
and 'one of the best small companies I have ever seen'. Its products are
market leaders and more than 60 per cent of sales are exported to more than
40 countries. The dryer business is going well, and the new nitrogen
generators have tremendous potential. The process division is also seen as a
sound investment, in spite of its present modest profits. Alas, all this
quality comes at a price, and forecast full-year profits of Pounds 5.6m put
the shares on a prospective multiple of 23 - a 45 per cent premium to the
market. The shares are tightly held, but those who are lucky enough to have
got on board still have no reason to sell.

FT  01 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Johnston Press up by 11% to Pounds 6.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Johnston Press, the Edinburgh-based group which owns weekly newspapers
throughout Britain, increased pre-tax profits by almost 11 per cent to
Pounds 6.67m, against Pounds 6.02m, in the six months to June 30. Turnover
improved from Pounds 41.5m to Pounds 44.3m.
Mr Fred Johnston, chairman, said market conditions were generally improving
but growth in advertising revenues varied between different business sectors
and regions.
The group is to disengage from its printing businesses which lost Pounds
195,000 (Pounds 64,000). It hopes to sell the two companies - Wood Westworth
at St Helens, Merseyside, and Yorkshire Communications at Wakefield, West
Yorkshire - but if not they will be closed. A provision of Pounds 507,000
has been made against either course of action.
Operating profit, which excludes the provision, was up 18 per cent at Pounds
6.96m (Pounds 5.9m).
The results included a two week contribution from Halifax Courier Holdings,
acquired in June for Pounds 29.4m. This was the group's largest purchase and
brought it its first daily newspaper, the Evening Courier in Halifax, as
well as titles in West Yorkshire and the Isle of Man. The acquisition will
boost annual turnover by between Pounds 10m and Pounds 12m.
Among the group's other newspaper interests, Scotland did well, with a
strong rise in profitability. Newspapers generally improved their
profitability in the north of England, the Midlands and Sussex.
Net borrowings were Pounds 2m at June 30, the group having been cash
positive at the end of 1993. Gearing was 7.1 per cent.
Earnings per share rose from 12.9p to 13.9p. The interim dividend is raised
to 2.75p, against 2.5p.
COMMENT
The shares have fallen from a peak of 669p in recent months, partly because
the market assumed that as a newspaper company it must be suffering in the
national price war. In fact only 6 per cent of its revenue comes from
newspaper sales, the bulk coming from advertising. Yesterday the shares
advanced 15p to 605p in recognition of its good performance and reliable
growth record. UBS, the house broker, is forecasting pre-tax profits of
Pounds 15.4m for the current year, for earnings of 31.5p and a multiple of
19. That seems realistic.

In its first set of results since gaining a listing through its reversal
into Greyfriars Investment Company, IAF Group reported pre-tax profits of
Pounds 2.61m for the nine months to end-June.
The outcome compared with a profit of Pounds 2.02m for the previous 12 month
period and was achieved on turnover of Pounds 6.81m, against Pounds 7.81m.
IAF adopted the June year end at the time of the take-over.
Basic earnings per share emerged at 2.41p (1.86p), or 2.37p (1.87p) fully
diluted.
Following the loss of its investment trust status, the company was left with
a large adverse balance on the capital reserve account. It proposes to
present resolutions at the forthcoming AGM to reorganise the share capital
and reserves to correct this position.
Conditional upon these resolutions being passed, the directors propose to
pay a nominal dividend of 0.1p.

Prolific, the fund management subsidiary of Scottish Provident, is planning

the sector over the five years to August 1, according to Micropal.
The public offer is due to open on September 22 and close on October 13.
Shares will be issued at 100p, with launch expenses capped at 4.9 per cent.
Warrants will be attached on a 1-to-5 ratio, and the trust will have an
initial life of 10 years. The annual management fee will be 0.8 per cent.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Louis Newmark, the engineering and specialist equipment group, reduced
pre-tax losses from Pounds 1.58m to Pounds 896,000 in the year to April 2.
The result is in line with interim expectations with the second half loss
coming down from Pounds 689,000 to Pounds 258,000.
Mr John Newmark, chairman, said that the first half loss for the present
year was likely to be similar to the same period last time. But he said that
he would expect a generally improved trading situation to show through in
the second half.
Turnover rose from Pounds 23.9m to Pounds 26.8m, helped particularly by a 39
per cent increase in watch sales from Pounds 4.71m to Pounds 6.53m.
Losses per share were 21.3p (53.8p) and again no dividend is recommended.

GPA, the Irish aircraft leasing company which in August successfully
strengthened its balance sheet with a Dollars 998m (Pounds 600m) aircraft
lease portfolio securitisation (Alps 94-1) package, yesterday reported a net
post-tax loss of Dollars 5m for the quarter to June 30. Losses in the year
to March 31 1994 totalled Dollars 64m.
The package enabled GPA to meet the terms of the refinancing thrashed out
with its bankers in October 1993.
Revenue for the quarter was Dollars 389m and cash inflow from operating
activities was Dollars 293m, inclusive of net proceeds from aircraft sales
of Dollars 109m. Respective figures for the year were Dollars 1.84bn and
Dollars 1.26bn.
Shareholders' funds at June 30 were Dollars 182m against borrowings of
Dollars 5.4bn. Cash balances stood at Dollars 291m, with undrawn facilities
of more than Dollars 200m.
Mr Patrick Blaney, chief executive, said the trading performance reflected
the continuing difficult trading environment. He was pleased that Alps 94-1
had agreed to acquire a portfolio of 27 aircraft over several months.

FT  01 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Guinness buys back Haig brand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Haig, once the leading Scotch whisky in the UK, has returned to Guinness's
drinks portfolio after eight years with Whyte &amp; Mackay Group, a subsidiary
of American Brands.
After Guinness took over Distillers in 1986, the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission required Guinness to reduce its share of the UK Scotch market to
25 per cent by selling Haig and nine other brands to Whyte &amp; Mackay.
Guinness retained Dimple Haig, the upmarket version famous for its 'pinch'
bottle, and the Haig brand elsewhere. It is the leading Scotch in Germany,
Greece and Ireland.
A brand dating back to the 19th century, Haig was the UK market leader until
the 1960s. It then suffered from a supermarket price war and competition
from other whiskies such as Bell's, Teachers and Famous Grouse. Industry
observers believe only some 30,000 cases of Haig were sold in the UK last
year, compared with 3m for Bell's, the market leader.
'We have no plans to make it a major brand in Britain,' Guinness said. 'We
will continue to focus on Bell's but there may be a niche marketing
opportunity with Haig.'
Guinness declined to give a value for the deal, but it is thought to be
under Pounds 5m.

FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: Irish Continental cuts loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MCMANUS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Irish Continental Group, the ferry and freight company, reduced interim
losses by 35 per cent to IPounds 3.45m (Pounds 3.42m) as a result of
increased passenger and roll on-roll off freight traffic across the Irish
Sea.
Turnover grew by 18 per cent to IPounds 46m in the six months to the end of
April, reflecting increased carryings of cars and freight. There was also a
first time contribution from the charter of the MV Pride of Bilbao
super-ferry which ICG acquired for IPounds 56m last November and is
chartered to P&amp;O.
ICG traditionally incurs a loss in the first half of the year since the
tourist season coincides with the second half.
'It is primarily on the Irish Sea that we are seeing growth,' said Mr Eamonn
Rothwell, managing director. The ferry division increased turnover by 18 per
cent to IPounds 31.7m, and the seasonal loss improved from IPounds 4.7m to
IPounds 2.9m.
However, the group's freight capacity on the Irish Sea remains constrained
by the size of its fleet. 'There is frustrated demand on the freight side,'
according to Mr Rothwell. ICG plans to introduce a new IPounds 46m
super-ferry on the Irish Sea routes in 1995. The ship is currently under
construction in the Netherlands and the cost is being met through bank
borrowing and the proceeds of a IPounds 29.2m rights issue last March.
Mr Rothwell said the group was experiencing increasing competition on its
routes to France from the Republic of Ireland, with its main rival Brittany
Ferries increasing capacity on these routes.
The container division, which includes a 25 per cent stake in Bell Lines,
the shipping company, increased turnover by 16 per cent to IPounds 14.5m for
operating profits of IPounds 1.5m, including IPounds 200,000 from Bell. ICG
has ended its freight joint venture with Pandora on the Dublin to Liverpool
route as it was not making a significant contribution.
Mr Rothwell declined to comment on the company's full-year performance,
saying that a clear picture would not emerge until after the end of the
tourist season. The company declared an interim dividend of 1.2p (0.97p).

FT  01 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Mowlem returns to black with Pounds 700,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Mowlem, the construction equipment and contracting group, moved back
into the black, with interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 700,000 against a
loss of Pounds 41.8m for the same period last year.
The results, for the six months to June 30, were the first since a financial
restructuring in March, and showed all the group's divisions improving.
Borrowing was all but wiped out by the proceeds of the Pounds 64m rights
issue, and the disposal of the housebuilding division in July - sold to
Beazer for Pounds 31m - has left the group cash positive. Turnover slipped
Pounds 12m to Pounds 646m.
The SGB scaffolding hire arm showed the most marked improvement, with
profits nearly tripling to Pounds 6.3m (Pounds 2.4m). Contracting moved from
break-even to notch up profits of Pounds 700,000. Losses at the London City
Airport fell by 33 per cent to Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 2.4m).
Earnings per share were 0.5p (38.4p losses). The company reiterated its
intention to pay a final dividend of 2p.
COMMENT
Shareholders who stumped up the Pounds 64m needed to stop Mowlem breaching
its covenants six months ago will have been doubly relieved yesterday to see
the group return to profitability, and the shares creeping above the 100p
rights issue price. That the company has turned the corner is beyond doubt.
This is reflected in analysts' pre-tax profit forecasts for 1995 which range
from Pounds 11m to Pounds 18m - a handsome leap from the current year's
Pounds 3m to Pounds 5m estimates. However, beyond this, market optimism
begins to dry up. Few analysts share Mowlem's belief that it can achieve
Pounds 40m annual profits, even in the medium-term. Even at the bottom of
next year's forecasts, the prospective p/e is about 18 making the rating
look very demanding.

FT  01 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Hartstone 45% take-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hartstone Group's investors have taken up less than half the available
shares in the leathergoods and hosiery company's Pounds 30m rescue rights
issue.
The group will still be able to meet its October deadline to repay Pounds
15m to lenders, however - a key element of its recent refinancing.
The issue was underwritten by J Henry Schroder Wagg, the merchant bank, and
sub-underwritten by several institutions.
After the rights, Schroders will control 13.8 per cent of Hartstone, either
directly or through funds under discretionary management.
Hartstone announced yesterday that acceptances had been received for 44.66
per cent of the 215.64m shares on offer in the 2-for-1 cash call at 15p.
However, it put a brave face on the outcome, and pointed to the fact that
the shares closed  1/2 p down at 16p, above the rights price.
Hartstone's annual meeting to approve the accounts will be held in High
Wycombe today.

FT  01 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Coutts Consulting shares shed 25% on dim
outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of Coutts Consulting yesterday shed 25 per cent of their value as the
career consultancy, outplacement and residential training company reported
disappointing first half figures.
The shares closed 22p down at 67p after Mr Stephen Johnson, chief executive,
said he expected operating profits for the full year would fall below
expectations and would only match the Pounds 1.52m of 1993.
Pre-tax profits emerged at Pounds 341,000 (losses Pounds 5.24m after
exceptional costs of Pounds 6.41m). Turnover on continuing operations
declined to Pounds 7.75m (Pounds 9.42m) with discontinued operations
contributing a further Pounds 1.98m.
Operating profit from continuing activities was sharply down at Pounds
569,000 (Pounds 1.13m); discontinued activities incurred losses of Pounds
802,000.
Mr Johnson said the main cause of the decline was lower revenues from
outplacement because of deferrals of large contracts.
He added that revenue damage in the first half would not now be repaired in
the second.
Operating profits at the residential training division slid to Pounds
408,000 (Pounds 599,000).
Nevertheless, dividends are resumed via an interim of 0.4p, payable from
earnings of 1.2p (losses 21.43p) per share.

FT  01 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Housebuilders offer evidence of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Share prices of housebuilders rose sharply yesterday after companies
reported that new house sales had recovered last month after a poor June and
July.
Persimmon, the UK's eighth-biggest housebuilder, said it had sold 250 homes
in August, 25 per cent more than August last year.
Ideal Homes, part of Trafalgar House, the construction, property, shipping
and hotels group, also reported higher August sales than a year ago.
Wimpey, the UK's biggest housebuilder, which announces first-half profits
next Tuesday, is also thought to have seen sales bounce back in August after
falling in the first two months of the summer.
Mr Jeremy Withers Green, analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing, said: 'This shows
that the housing recovery is still on track, while new homes are taking
market share and selling better than existing houses and flats.'
Persimmon, which yesterday announced a 34 per cent rise in interim pre-tax
profits to Pounds 11.3m, saw its share price rise 10p to 262p. Barratt
Development rose 12p to 210p; Berkeley Homes 15p to 430p and Wilson Connolly
17p to 234p.
Mr Duncan Davidson, Persimmon's chairman, said: 'I believe the recovery is
sufficiently entrenched to withstand an increase in interest rates of up to
one percentage point - although I would prefer rates not to increase.'
He said that Persimmon had increased net profit on each sale to Pounds 7,818
from Pounds 4,825 in the first six months of last year. This compared with a
peak profit per house of Pounds 18,000 in 1988-89. The aim was to get this
back to Pounds 10,000 a unit.

Waterglade International, the lossmaking property developer, announced
yesterday it was holding talks with rebel shareholders who have been seeking
to oust the board.
Mr David Cunningham, chairman, said the board was seeking 'an amicable
solution' to the company's problems.
The board overcame attempts by rebel shareholders to have it ousted by
cancelling an EGM on August 18 on a technicality.
The meeting had been called by rebel shareholders, led by Mr Winston Ng, to
instal a new board which would include Mr Ng, Mr Anthony Midgen and Mr
Selwyn Midgen.
Mr Anthony Midgen said counter proposals made by the board last week had
been rejected, but he hoped for a further meeting soon.

FT  01 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Rugby up 17% but sentiment clouded by
trading warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK cement sales rose by 8 per cent in the first six months of this year,
according to Rugby Group which yesterday announced a 17 per cent rise in
first-half profits to Pounds 35.6m, against Pounds 30.5m.
The building materials group, which now generates higher worldwide sales and
profits from joinery than cement, increased its interim dividend from 1.425p
to 1.5p.
Its share price fell 5p to 139p, however, on warnings from Mr Peter Carr,
managing director, that trading conditions in the UK joinery business were
becoming increasingly competitive.
UK cement profits rose by 11.4 per cent to Pounds 9.8m with turnover
increased by 11 per cent to Pounds 64.5m. Cement sales were helped by
increased housebuilding, a rise in infrastructure construction, and greater
industrial building.
UK joinery sales increased by 16 per cent to Pounds 75.1m while operating
profits rose by 19 per cent to Pounds 8.6m. This reflected sharp rises in
raw material timber prices, which have risen by some 13 per cent during the
past 12 months.
Mr Carr warned that profits could come under pressure if UK manufacturers
continued to battle to increase market share.
UK metals profits increased by 55 per cent to Pounds 3.1m, on a sales
increase of just 16 per cent to Pounds 67m. UK profits over the three
divisions rose by 19 per cent to Pounds 21.5m.
Overseas profits increased by 21 per cent to Pounds 14.5m. Australian cement
and lime profits, which rose 25 per cent to Pounds 7.4m, would have been
almost flat but for Pounds 1.2m raised from land sales.
US joinery profits fell by a third to Pounds 1m due mainly to poor weather
while European joinery profits increased to Pounds 4.9m (Pounds 2.6m) helped
by new acquisitions.
COMMENT
The cloud hanging over Rugby's share price yesterday was the prospect of
further skirmishing between UK joinery manufacturers just as their raw
material costs have soared. The pace of recovery in UK cement demand is also
likely to slacken next year. The acquisition of Bunzl's US distribution
business is rightly well regarded, but prospects elsewhere look a little
dull compared with others in the sector. Annual pre-tax profits of Pounds
80m followed by Pounds 95m next time would put the group on a prospective
p/e of 14 on 1995 earnings, which is dear enough.

FT  01 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Partco reveals three year expansion plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Redfern, managing director of Partco, said yesterday he wanted the
group to double in size within the next two to three years, both by
acquisition and organic growth.
His statement came as the independent distributor of automotive parts and
equipment reported a 46 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.01m
to Pounds 2.93m for the six months to June 30. The advance prompted a 13p
climb in the share price to 246p.
Turnover at Partco, which raised Pounds 20.7m at its flotation in March,
rose 3.2 per cent to Pounds 65.6m (Pounds 63.5m), about 1 per cent of the
total UK market, according to Mr Redfern. He added that inflation had a
minimal effect in its market place.
Mr Chris Scott, finance director, said that sales had only risen 7 per cent
in three years, but that the operating margin rose 17.1 points to 4.8 per
cent. The group ascribed this to improved productivity and cost control.
Partco completes tomorrow the Pounds 2.41m acquisition of the 32-branch
Woodhead RSR, which broadens the group's scope beyond cars and light
commercial vehicles into trucks and buses.
Mr Scott thought Woodhead, which along with Partco's greenfield expansion
increases the number of branches to 244, should be earnings enhancing in
1995. In the year to March 1994, Woodhead had operating profits of Pounds
629,000 on turnover of Pounds 19.5m. He added that there were still a
further 200 locations into which the group could expand.
The group has Pounds 5.1m cash in hand. After a tax charge which Mr Scott
expects to remain at 20 per cent for two more years, earnings grew 33 per
cent to 8.4p (6.3p) per share. A maiden interim dividend of 2p is declared.

FT  01 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Provident Financial ahead 40% to Pounds
30.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Provident Financial, the personal loan and consumer finance group, yesterday
reported a 40 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 21.9m to
Pounds 30.7m.
The dividend is raised by 37 per cent to 6.5p. The aim is that this should
represent one third and the final dividend two thirds of the total for the
year.
Almost all the profits increase came from the home collected credit
business, where the pre-tax outcome for the six months to June 30 rose 39
per cent to Pounds 27.9m (Pounds 20.1m).
There was a 12 per cent increase in the amount of credit issued, reflecting
a rise of about 6 per cent in the number of customers, which reached 1.1m,
and a higher average loan at between Pounds 300 and Pounds 400. The group's
central costs fell from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 2.6m.
The home collection credit business saw a further reduction in the number of
offices to 257, against 267 at the year-end, and a further cut of 46 in the
number of staff to 3,404.
By contrast, the self-employed sales force increased by 170 to about 8,000.
They deal mainly with tenants on council estates and act as agents
collecting payments from borrowers' homes for the unsecured loans offered by
the group.
Mr John van Kuffeler, chief executive, said the group was committed to a
continuing programme of cost reduction.
The charge for bad debts rose by 4 per cent - a higher absolute amount than
in the first half of 1993, but a lower proportion of the amount of credit
issued.
The insurance division reported a 4 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 5.5m (Pounds 5.3m), which came almost entirely from Provident
Insurance, the underwriting operation. It specialises in areas of the market
where competition from direct writers has not been so fierce, such as third
party insurance.
Colonnade Insurance Brokers broke even; it made Pounds 528,000 last time.
COMMENT
Not for the first time, Provident Financial has produced
better-than-expected results. Now that it has had a full year of benefits
from getting out of non-core businesses and stringent cost-cutting, the
question must be whether this progress can be continued. The growth in loans
is encouraging, but the scope for further reductions in costs must narrow
eventually, slowing increases in profitability. Full-year pre-tax profits of
about Pounds 80m would give it a prospective p/e of about 13.5. The business
is moving in the right direction, but after a good run since the end of June
the price looks about right.

<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits of Persimmon, the UK's eighth largest housebuilder, jumped
34 per cent, from Pounds 8.44m to Pounds 11.3m, in the first six months of
this year, helped by sharply higher sales and margins.
The housing operation on its own increased profits by 85 per cent, with last
year's figures boosted by sale of advance corporation tax benefits of Pounds
2.36m.
Turnover advanced from Pounds 73.4m to Pounds 91.3m.
The interim dividend is increased from 2.8p to 3p, and is more than twice
covered by earnings per share which rose from 6.7p to 7p.
The shares put on 10p to close at 262p yesterday.
Mr Duncan Davidson, chairman, said profit margins had risen substantially as
the group had used up much of the expensive land it bought in the late
1980s. Sales incentives introduced during the recession had also been
reduced, while new house prices had risen by a 'few per cent'.
Selling costs, which had risen from Pounds 1,500 per home in 1989 to Pounds
5,500 in 1992, had fallen to Pounds 3,700 by the first half of this year and
were expected to fall to Pounds 3,000 next year.
The number of homes sold during the first half had increased by 14.5 per
cent, from 1,260 to 1,443. Persimmon expected to push up sales for the year
as a whole from 2,771 to at least 3,250, rising to 4,000 next year.
Mr Davidson was confident that the slow recovery in the housing market would
continue. The company, to satisfy its expansion plans, had increased its
land holdings to 16,500 plots owned or controlled with planning permission.
This compared with about 14,300 a year ago.
Persimmon expected to increase the number of plots to about 20,000 during
the next 18 months. Mr Davidson said net borrowings as a result could rise
to about Pounds 40m by the end of this year, equivalent to gearing of 20 per
cent.
This compared with net cash of Pounds 6m at the end of June following the
group's Pounds 50m rights issue in March.
COMMENT
Persimmon's share price, which had underperformed the sector by about 7 per
cent since the March rights issue, deserved to bounce back yesterday, helped
by better news of August house sales. The margin improvement is encouraging,
although the company is unlikely to recover to previous levels. The market,
rightly, was perturbed about a further increase in the number of shares in
issue, which has risen by 49 per cent since 1990. But the relative decline
in Persimmon's rating looks to have gone too far for a quality builder with
a strong land bank. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 30m, including ACT proceeds,
would put the shares on a prospective p/e of 14.5, which looks cheap against
the sector.

FT  01 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Spurs victory takes shares to four-year
high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Tottenham Hotspur yesterday climbed 19p to a four-year peak of
144p as the north London football club reaped the benefits of its successful
league form.
About 45,000 shares were traded as the price jumped to its highest level
since Mr Alan Sugar, chairman of the Amstrad electronics group, took a stake
in the club in 1991.
Yesterday's rise, prompted by the club's third win in four games, boosted
the value of Mr Sugar's 50.88 per cent holding to Pounds 11.7m.
Analysts were reluctant to forecast likely pre-tax profits for the year to
May 31, due next Thursday, but predicted that operating profits before
transfer fees and provisions could rise from Pounds 1.34m to about Pounds
2.5m.
The share price increase, meanwhile, lifted the company's market
capitalisation by some 15 per cent to Pounds 23.1m - a threefold increase on
the Pounds 7.6m value in 1991 when Mr Sugar joined forces with Mr Terry
Venables, the former team manager, to mount a bid.
At that time, Mr Sugar and Mr Venables paid 75p a share for a 37 per cent
stake.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Lonrho vote on Rowland today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lonrho directors will today vote on whether to strip Mr Tiny Rowland of his
executive powers, in a move which may end his 33-year reign over the
international trading group. Although the formal agenda of today's board
meeting does not contain a motion to depose him as joint chief executive,
directors are expected to raise the question of whether he should continue
in the post as part of 'any other business'.
One director said: 'I am determined to push to remove him.' However, another
said: 'Betting against Tiny has always been dangerous.' The move to oust Mr
Rowland has been prompted by disclosures that he costs the company more than
Pounds 5.5m a year in salary, expenses and other charges under his direct
control.
Some directors are also concerned that the company has sold a recently
completed film about the Lockerbie bombing to an Egyptian company linked to
Libya, in possible contravention of United Nations sanctions.
Mr Rowland has increasingly been at loggerheads with his joint chief
executive, Mr Dieter Bock, a German developer who owns 18.8 per cent of the
group.
The board meeting, which will begin mid-morning in London, is expected to be
attended by all 14 directors. Mr Rowland can be certain of the support of
only two board members, Mr Rene Leclezio and Mr Robert Dunlop, both of whom
retire this autumn.
A simple majority of voting directors is necessary to strip a director of
executive powers. There is unlikely to be an attempt to remove Mr Rowland
from the board altogether, as this requires a notice to be signed by 75 per
cent of directors.
Mr Rowland may attempt to supersede the board by calling an extraordinary
meeting of shareholders. One of the group's biggest shareholders said
yesterday that if Mr Rowland did this, his institution would vote its shares
based on the recommendation of Lonrho's three non-executive directors, who
were appointed on Mr Bock's initiative.
The Pounds 5.5m annual cost of Mr Rowland includes a contribution of about
Pounds 500,000 to the costs of his two homes, more than Pounds 1m in
business expenses and Pounds 200,000 to pay for the education of dependants
of African politicians.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Japan Tobacco at Pounds 9,410 a share leaves 'em gasping:
Monopoly's privatisation price seems steep as core growth is being
extinguished
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese finance ministry yesterday put a market value of Y2,876bn
(Pounds 18.6bn) on the country's monopoly cigarette manufacturer, setting
the privatisation price for Japan Tobacco at what many found a gasp-inducing
Y1.438m (Pounds 9,410) per share.
While maximising revenues for the government at a time when its tax receipts
are down, the pricing drew concerns from analysts that the Tokyo Stock
Exchange might be in for another bumpy autumn journey.
Initial trading last October in JR East, the previous big state sell-off,
all but derailed the exchange's systems as the price ran up furiously. But
liquidity was drained from the rest of the market, and stock in the regional
train operator eventually fell back to join other issues in a hibernation
which they have yet to shake off.
Japan Tobacco shares, which go on sale from tomorrow, start trading on
October 27. Like JR East, the company has strong cash flow and a healthy
land portfolio. It is also virtually debt-free. But like tobacco groups
elsewhere, it has no prospect of growth in its main business. Its
diversification attempts are not expected to contribute significantly to
earnings for as much as a decade. JT's asset base helped prompt bids of up
to Y2.11m a share in a pre-offer auction among institutions. Although the
lowest accepted bid in the auction of 230,000 shares, or 11.5 per cent of
equity, was more than Y1.36m, some securities houses said the shares were
worth only Y500,000 if measured against western industry leaders such as
Philip Morris of the US, maker of Marlboro.
After the public tranche, the government will retain two-thirds control of
JT, and has left intact its status as the only licensed producer of
cigarettes in Japan. The market has, however, been open to imports since
1987, and these have grown steadily to account for 17.9 per cent of all
cigarettes sold in Japan last year.
JT acknowledges that the rise in foreign penetration will continue. The
company's main advantage is its distribution system, which extends to
pavement vending machines which fall under its control. The main foreign
brand there is Marlboro, which JT makes under licence.
The group has struck a similar deal with France's Seita state monopoly to
produce Gitanes Blondes, and international links are seen as a way forward.
JT licenses its own best-selling Mild Seven brand to be manufactured in
Malaysia, and in 1992 bought Manchester Tobacco in the UK to supply Europe
and parts of Asia. In May JT said it was quintupling capacity in Manchester
to 10bn cigarettes a year, a figure that pales compared with the 272.9bn JT
products which Japanese lit up last year.
Japan is among the few developed countries where most men still smoke - 59.8
per cent - but the proportion is slowly falling, while the 13.8 per cent of
women who are smokers has barely changed in a decade. JT admits: 'We will
see a decline in the number of young people who are the primary consumers,
so the tobacco industry will be faced with difficulties.'
Japan, where foreign consumer products have usually sold on a premium image,
has not yet encountered the wave of supermarket brands which have brought
price competition to some western cigarette markets. In the current climate
of austerity JT recognises this as a threat and at least one US maker has
begun selling a discounted line in Japan.
To shape up for the private sector, JT's workforce has been cut by nearly a
quarter to 23,700 and the number of domestic plants reduced by a similar
margin to 26. It has sought other businesses, most notably pharmaceuticals
where it now produces 40 over-the-counter drugs and an agent used in
chemotherapy, its first prescription treatment developed in-house. But it is
likely to be 10 years before the sector generates an income stream, and
outlays are still high.
The company spent Y40bn on a research centre for the division and says that
such spending, along with increased promotional for its tobacco business,
account for a steady increase in marketing and administrative expenses -
these outlays rose 44 per cent over the past five years while pre-tax
profits were up a little more than a third.
JT is forecasting a 4.5 per cent dip in profits before tax to Y109bn in its
current year to March, on a 2.6 per cent decline in sales to Y2,711bn. Net
earnings are, however, projected to emerge higher at Y36,000 a share against
Y33,246, from which a dividend of at least Y5,000 will be paid. Net assets
per share in March were put at Y564,947.
Most foreign funds which track Japanese stock market indices will shell out
for some Mild Seven. But Mr Keith Donaldson, investment strategist at
Salomon Bros in Tokyo, says: 'I don't think I'd recommend it at this price.'
Individual Japanese investors may decide differently. But in a country where
decisions are commonly made in smoke-filled rooms, there was one possible
portent yesterday. As Mr Masayoshi Takemura, finance minister, chaired the
meeting of dozens of officials and advisers which set the JT price, the air
was curiously clear.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Metallgesellschaft escapes from Castle contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A gaping hole in Metallgesellschaft's finances was plugged yesterday after
the struggling German metals and engineering group negotiated its way out of
a series of crippling contracts with a US oil refiner. The costly
relationship, which recently forced Metallgesellschaft to sell prime assets
to generate DM1bn (Pounds 400m) to cover expected losses on the contracts,
is to end on January 31.
The deal could mark the group's most significant step towards financial
health since its creditor banks provided a DM3.4bn rescue package to save it
from collapse last January. Under a complex two-stage agreement, MG Corp,
the group's US subsidiary, will effectively cancel all existing links - as
shareholder, customer and financier - with Castle Energy.
The extraordinary customer relationship was developed by now-departed US
executives. It obliged MG Corp to buy all Castle's refinery output until the
year 2000 at prices above market levels.
Mr Kajo Neukirchen, group chairman, recently described Castle, in which MG
Corp had a 40 per cent stake, as a money-making machine. MG Corp was a
money-destroying machine, he said. Group officials were unable last night to
specify the cost of the arrangements, which include Metallgesellschaft's
assuming Dollars 375m (Pounds 242m) of Castle's third-party debt and
cancelling Castle's obligations to MG Corp. 'It is expensive, but the
alternative (to honour the oil contracts) would have been much, much
dearer,' a spokesman said. 'We are all very relieved,' he added.
It also emerged yesterday that Metallgesellschaft is preparing to place its
47 per cent stake in the Kolbenschmidt automotive components group if talks
with potential industrial buyers fail again. Plans were being drawn up as an
'option' to raise about DM250m, banking sources said.
Industry officials suggested the preparations were intended to 'put a squib'
under Dana Corp of the US and Britain's T&amp;N, the two leading contenders for
the stake. A placing would almost certainly result in the holding's being
taken into 'safe German hands'. The leaked news that the shares could be
placed might have been a warning to Dana and T&amp;N that they could miss an
important opportunity in the German market if they tried to drive too hard a
bargain, the officials suggested.
Metallgesellschaft confirmed negotiations had resumed with Dana, which
unexpectedly pulled out of a purchase agreement signed in March after
reportedly deciding the price was too high and that it wanted to exclude
Kolbenschmidt's aluminium foundry from the deal.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Broadgate suitors agog at Pounds 1.5bn value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Potential buyers of Broadgate Properties, the City property investment
company owned jointly by Stanhope and Rosehaugh, have been told that the
company will be worth Pounds 1.5bn in three years' time, compared with its
most recent valuation of Pounds 935m.
Jones Lang Wootton, which has been advising Stanhope on Broadgate, has
indicated to interested parties that rents, excluding concessions, in
Broadgate's core City properties should reach Pounds 50 per sq ft within 18
months. This compares with current estimates of around Pounds 30 per sq ft,
which implies an explosion in City property prices back to the peak levels
of 1989/1990, which saw average prime rents of Pounds 55 per sq ft.
Potential bidders were agog at the price, and dismissed it as an attempt to
divert them from Stanhope's weak negotiating position. Stanhope has to
restructure its Pounds 160m debt by the end of this year, when its bank
lines come under review.
Interest has been intensifying in Stanhope, which had a net negative worth
of Pounds 15.8m in June 1993, but which still controls a large high quality
property portfolio.
Mr Stuart Lipton, Stanhope's chief executive, is confident that his
portfolio will remain intact. He is keen to arrange a restructuring,
enabling Stanhope to buy the Rosehaugh receiver's half of Broadgate, but
analysts dismissed this as a pipe dream. It is more likely that Stanhope
will have to part with its own stake in the holding company for the
Broadgate and Ludgate developments.
The front runner for such a purchase is Mr John Ritblat's British Land,
which owns 29.9 per cent of Stanhope's shares - sufficient to block any
financial reconstruction under Stanhope's quaintly named 'Project Phoenix'.
British Land has made no qualms about the fact that its only interest is
Broadgate. US securities houses, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, are also
known to be interested, and there is a fourth bidder lined up.
There has also been renewed interest in Stanhope's debt. Long-Term Credit
Bank has found a buyer for Pounds 20m of debt, at a price of around 60p in
the pound. It is understood that Bankers Trust is the buyer, but there may
be other sub-participants, prepared to gamble on a successful restructuring.
Part of the attraction of Stanhope is its pre-emption rights over
Rosehaugh's Broadgate stake. Mr Tim Hayward, senior corporate recovery
partner of accountants KPMG Peat Marwick and joint receiver of property
group Rosehaugh, said there had been serious expressions of interest from a
number of investors. 'We have repeatedly said we will not be pushed into a
sale and have strong support from the Rosehaugh's bankers.'
JLW have argued that activity in the City property market is picking up at a
time when the supply of new quality space remains limited, providing the
potential for rental increases.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Japanese court backs Fujitsu on chip patent
</HEADLINE>

A Japanese court ruled yesterday that semiconductors made by Fujitsu, the
Japanese electronics and computer manufacturer, do not infringe a patent
covering the invention of the integrated circuit or semiconductor chip,
which is held by Texas Instruments of the US.
The ruling highlights the gap between the two countries in the
interpretation and enforcement of patent rights in spite of a recent
agreement to make their patent systems more compatible.
The decision appears likely to increase friction between the US and Japan
over intellectual property rights. A spokesman for the US trade
representative said US trade officials were 'aware of and interested in the
case'.
Mr Richard Agnich, Texas Instruments' senior vice-president and general
counsel, said the decision 'flies in the face of logic and justice'. The
company would file an appeal, he said.
The legal dispute goes back to 1991 when Fujitsu asked the court to declare
that the 'Kilby' patent, named after the co-inventor of the semiconductor
chip, does not apply to modern-day memory chips. Texas Instruments then
sought an injunction to halt Fujitsu's manufacture and sale of memory chips.
The Tokyo district court decided that Fujitsu's products did not infringe
the Kilby patent on the ground that the patent covers old technology not
being used today.
For Texas Instruments, the decision is particularly onerous because the
company has been fighting for its Kilby patent in Japan since 1959, when the
company filed its application with the Japanese patent office. It took the
US company close to 30 years, however, to win the patent, which was awarded
in 1989 after opposition from Japanese companies.
Japan has a 'first to file' patent system, unlike the US system, which is
based on the principle of 'first to invent'.
In addition, patents in Japan can be challenged before they are granted,
whereas in the US opposing claims are filed after the patent is granted.
'We are deeply disturbed by a patent system that keeps a major invention
tied up in the Japan patent office for 29 years, and, when the patent is
issued, in effect claims that it covers old technology and does not pertain
to products made today,' Mr Agnich said.
Japanese courts have generally interpreted patents narrowly, enabling
Japanese companies to obtain numerous 'improvement patents' covering related
developments.
Texas Instruments has already won licensing agreements for the Kilby patent,
which expires in 2001, from 16 Japanese semiconductor makers. In addition to
Fujitsu, Sanyo has also refused to license the patent although both
companies have cross-licensing agreements with Texas for thousands of other
patents.
Yesterday's decision may affect renegotiations of cross-licensing agreements
due next year. Texas Instruments said it was impossible to calculate the
value of a single patent among the thousands that it held.
In New York, Texas Instruments stock closed at Dollars 77 7/8 , down Dollars
4 5/8 on the day.

FT  01 SEP 94 / City fears impact on market from selective data release
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A controversy has broken out in the City over price-sensitive economic
statistics amid claims that their selective release is leading to market
leaks.
The privately compiled figures - the monthly UK purchasing managers' index -
are distributed to fee-paying subscribers hours ahead of the general market.
Although City analysts protest that the system is adding to market
volatility, the Chartered Institute for Purchasing and Supply, which
produces the index, rejects the criticisms and insists on its right to
release the figures early to its customers.
The issue has become more controversial in recent weeks because the survey,
which questions almost 300 purchasing managers about business trends, has
become increasingly market-sensitive.
A leak of the data last month, for example, had a significant impact on bond
markets. Yesterday's data also contributed to a small, temporary dip in the
gilts market, analysts said, although the impact was quickly reversed. The
data showed that purchasing managers had reported substantial price rises in
August, fuelling market fears that the rapid pace of economic growth might
be creating manufacturing bottlenecks.
Mr Michael Waterson, chairman of the NTC research group, which collects the
data for the PMI, admitted yesterday that there had been 'one or two
mistakes' in the release of the data in the past.
However, he pointed out that modifications were introduced into the
distribution system yesterday, with institutions that paid the highest
Pounds 395 annual subscription fee now receiving the data only four hours
ahead of the rest of the market news services. Under the previous system,
some analysts had been receiving the data up to two days in advance.
'Nobody has a God-given right to information. We are not trying to blackmail
people - we are just asking for a few hundred pounds for a survey that costs
several thousands to produce,' Mr Waterson said, adding that the survey was
still losing money to produce.
Nevertheless, the system continued to provoke criticism in the City
yesterday, with some analysts arguing that the delayed release of the index
was exaggerating the impact of the data, not least because other main
economic indicators are released through the market news services at a set
time.
Mr Robin Aspinall, economist at brokers Panmure Gordon, said: 'The main
value of the index for me is just that people in the markets are talking
about it four hours ahead of the release.'
Meanwhile, a City fund manager, who previously had been receiving the data
early, said: 'Releasing the data early does create problems with inside
information - we have not been sure in the past how far we should use it.'
Nevertheless, the stock exchange said the issue did not appear to be
breaking regulations.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Smiles fail to hide gap between Kohl and Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
German chancellor Helmut Kohl and Russian president Boris Yeltsin
congratulated each other yesterday on the departure of Russian troops from
Germany after five decades, but the lingering divide between the two
countries echoed in their speeches during a day of ceremony.
Although the two men shook hands and smiled at each other, Mr Kohl was
determined to use the occasion to boost his chances for re-election next
month. He won re-election in 1990 after convincing Russia that it would not
be threatened by German unification.
A shaky Mr Yeltsin frequently referred to the role of Russian troops in
saving Germany from the 'tyranny and terror' of Hitler and also to the 12m
Russians who had died while ridding Europe of the Nazis. He did not mention
the Berlin Wall, Stalin or the Russian control over East Germany.
However, Mr Kohl did remind the audience. At the Schauspielhaus, east
Berlin's beautifully restored concert hall, he said that 'the pact between
the dictators Hitler and Stalin removed the last barrier to the war which
the National Socialist tyranny unleashed shortly afterwards'.
And he explained why he had opposed the Russians joining in next week's
ceremony saying farewell to British, US and French troops from Berlin.
'Terrible harm was done to the Russian people by the Germans and in the name
of the German people . . . but we Germans were destined to live through the
painful division of our country,' he said.
'The blockade of Berlin, the totalitarian regime in the east of our country,
the wall and barbed wire were a heavy and lasting burden on our relations.'
Mr Yeltsin tried another tack. Armed with a speech written by the Russian
defence ministry, he praised the Conference on Security and Co-operation
(CSCE), a non-military organisation grouping western, eastern Europe and the
former Soviet republics, and one in which Russia is seeking a much greater
role. This, he said was 'the real forum for stability and security from
Vancouver to Vladivostok'.
Mr Kohl seemed not to hear. At the Schauspielhaus, and later at Treptow Park
in east Berlin, home to the giant Soviet war memorial, he did not even
mention the CSCE. Instead, he said the 'signed agreements between Russia and
Nato on Partnership for Peace, and on co-operation with the European Union
are essential building blocks for the European House'.
German defence officials dutifully nodded in agreement, but the divide
between the two leaders was painfully apparent.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecom's latest price cuts show that the company has learnt a thing
or two about marketing. Reductions have been mandated by its regulator. But
Oftel determines neither the precise timing of cuts nor which services they
should focus on. In the past, BT often announced a confusing jumble of price
changes once a year. But the company has now woken up to the fact that the
timing and focus of price cuts can be used to throw the competition off
balance.
Cutting long-distance charges by up to 25 per cent is sensible since that is
a market where competition from its main rival, Mercury Communications, is
stiff. The timing looks designed to spoil the launch of Energis, which
opened its long-distance service only this week. Further cuts can be
expected to focus on international calls, where Mercury is also strong. But
BT will probably hold fire until it has a better idea of the competition it
will face from a new breed of international operators and so knows how to
cause the maximum damage.
BT is also becoming smarter about presenting price cuts. It now picks one
service at a time and so can articulate a clear message. That is essential
if it is to persuade customers, who generally think that calls are more
expensive than they actually are, to use their telephones more. None of this
is rocket science. But investors will pleased that BT's marketing department
is no longer in the dark ages.

Persimmon's comments on August house sales provided some cheer for its
shares yesterday, but they still ended 20p below the rights issue price in
March. Since then hopes of a sustained recovery in the housing market have
been dashed. The sharp rise in the cost of fixed-rate mortgages and talk of
the need for higher short-term rates stopped the improvement in its tracks
in June and July. Persimmon's report of a pick-up in August confirms
comments from other housebuilders but even these tentative signs have not
been mirrored in the overall housing transaction figures.
While housebuilders with the right products are having little trouble making
sales the problem with the second-hand market is the dearth of decent
supply. This in turn seems to be driven by the lack of house price inflation
which has removed any sense of urgency from the market. The low level of
house moves partly explains the depressed repair, maintenance and
improvement activity which was highlighted by the weak sales of bagged
cement reported by Rugby yesterday. But there appears to be more to it than
that. Stagnant prices may have made householders question the value of
adding that extension.
Such penny-pinching has prolonged the price war among the do-it-yourself
sheds which has brought continued deflation for consumer building products.
But with many of the sector's raw materials prices on the increase suppliers
like Spring Ram are having to keep hacking away at costs just to stand
still. Without an uptick in house prices the sector's recovery could soon
run out of steam.

FT  01 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Broadgate
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The tussle over the future of London's prestigious Broadgate development is
starting to resemble an elaborate game of poker. In addition to Rosehaugh
and Stanhope, joint owners of Broadgate Properties, at least three sets of
anxious bankers and an unknown number of potential buyers are involved.
British Land, the most aggressive of the bidders, has already strengthened
its hand by buying a 29.9 per cent stake in Stanhope itself. Talk of
Stanhope's debt changing hands in the secondary market raises the suspicion
that it, or another bidder, is trying to apply additional pressure.
Whatever the truth on that score, it is the attitude of lenders rather than
shareholders that will determine the final outcome. With the property market
moving in their favour, Rosehaugh's receivers and bankers have said that
they are in no mood to sell their share of Broadgate for less than a full
price. Since Stanhope is under pressure to restructure its Pounds 160m debt
by the end of the year, though, the question is whether its syndicate of 15
banks is prepared to take an equally optimistic view.
The Pounds 1.5bn target valuation of Broadgate by Stanhope's surveyors must
encourage them to do so. If the heady assumptions about rental growth prove
to be correct it would make sense for Stanhope to retain an equity interest
in Broadgate rather than selling at the first opportunity. After the
disappointments of recent years, though, the bankers must be inclined to
treat such forecasts with suspicion. The bidders must decide whether to call
their bluff.

FT  01 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Daimler revs up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Daimler-Benz has huge potential. This is not because the German behemoth has
performed well in recent years but precisely because it has not. It has
suffered from high engineering costs, over-staffing and a confusing mix of
businesses. This means there is massive scope to turn its operations around.
The good news from Daimler's first-half figures is that the first fruits of
restructuring are reaching the bottom line. There is more to come. It is not
simply a matter of shedding jobs and shifting production to lower-cost
locations. Daimler also needs to focus on those businesses where it can
achieve global scale. Mercedes already fits the bill. Most of its AEG
division, with the exception of rail systems, probably never can. Dasa, the
aerospace arm, is somewhere in between. For it to be a successful global
competitor, rationalisation of the European defence and aerospace industries
is necessary. In a few years, Daimler could turn itself into a streamlined
motor, aircraft and train manufacturer - after which one could re-examine
whether it makes sense for the three divisions to be yoked together.
The big risk for investors is that management could become complacent. With
demand picking up, the company may think the pressure to perform is off.
Yesterday's comments by the outgoing chairman, Mr Edzard Reuter, that this
year's profits would be 'thoroughly satisfactory' could cause some concern.
The net profit margins of 1 per cent forecast by analysts are measly. Mr
Jurgen Schrempp, the next chairman, should be aiming much higher.

FT  01 SEP 94 / The family firm fights back: In the first of a series, the
strengths of Sweden's Wallenberg dynasty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Sweden's phalanx of big international companies, the recession is
emphatically over.
In contrast to the atmosphere of crisis over the financial deficit in the
country's public sector, companies such as Volvo, Electrolux, Ericsson and
Saab-Scania have over the past two weeks reported a gush of half-year
profits after three of the toughest years Swedish industry has endured since
the 1930s.
As industry pulls out of recession, one striking feature has become clear.
In spite of dire predictions to the contrary from the markets, the
industrial dominion controlled by the Wallenberg family has not only
survived. Mr Peter Wallenberg, doyen of its fourth generation, has extended
its dominance of Swedish industry to unprecedented levels and entrenched the
family as Europe's most powerful industrial dynasty.
The core companies in the Wallenberg 'sphere' (the family, which rarely has
majority control of a company, prefers to call it an association of
companies rather than an empire) had a combined annual turnover last year
approaching SKr550bn (Pounds 46.6bn). Together, these companies make up
about 40 per cent of the market capitalisation of the Stockholm stock
exchange.
How have the Wallenbergs so strengthened their position? And as they
approach a handover from one generation to the next - with Peter Wallenberg
now 68 and his son Jacob and nephew Marcus being groomed to succeed him -
can they maintain their pre-eminence?
Between 1990 and 1993, the chief question was whether the empire could hold
together under the pressure of recession.
Mr Peter Wallenberg, who has the world-weary look of an old campaigner,
admits it was a rough period. 'All in all, it put the organisation to a very
tough test,' he said in an interview with the FT.
As recently as in early 1993, the outlook was still grim. Investor, the
holding company chaired by Peter Wallenberg which groups most of the main
family shareholdings, remained burdened with debt of more than Dollars 1bn.
Core companies such as Stora, Europe's largest forestry group, and SKF, the
company which invented ball-bearings, had reported losses in 1992 of
SKr1.42bn and SKr1.77bn respectively.
Saab-Scania, the vehicle and airplane maker bought out by Investor in 1991
as an anticipated source of cash flow, had seen profits slump, as had other
stalwarts such as Electrolux, the world's leading household equipment maker.
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, historically the family's financial flagship,
founded in 1856, was almost swamped by bad loans that sank it deep into
operating losses of SKr5.4bn in 1992.
Sceptics saw cracks in the Wallenberg edifice. Speculation was rife that a
pattern of marginal disposals and portfolio reshuffles would fail to satisfy
the empire's capital needs. A strategic disposal was keenly anticipated by
the markets.
The subsequent transformation owed much to the change in Sweden's economic
fortunes following the 25 per cent devaluation of the Swedish krona after
its flotation in November 1992. But the Wallenberg companies helped by
cracking down on costs, slashing as much as 20 per cent of their workforces.
By the end of last year, the crisis was over with most of the companies back
on a healthy profits path.
The balance sheet of Investor, the key holding company, has been
transformed. Piecemeal selling of shares in a number of companies, rather
than the disposal of a single large stake, drove down debt from SKr8.4bn at
the end of 1992 to SKr4.8bn a year later. This year the group has bolstered
its position further with a SKr3.45bn bid for its Export-Invest stablemate,
essentially a giant share issue.
Further strengthening is likely as dividend flows into the group's coffers
pick up. Bo Berggren, Investor vice-chairman and a Wallenberg lieutenant,
considers 'the Investor balance sheet today is probably as strong as it has
ever been.'
It was not just market conditions and restructuring that helped the family
pull through. The family was able to exploit Swedish 'dual-share' rules to
raise money from disposals without any loss of control in the target
company.
Swedish rules allow equity to be split between A and B shares with voting
power heavily weighted to the former. This system has long enabled the
Wallenbergs to control companies often with very little capital commitment.
Much the most significant factor in underscoring the dominance of the
Wallenberg family occurred, however, at Volvo where for 20 years, Mr Pehr
Gyllenhammar had striven to create a industrial empire to rival the
Wallenbergs.
Mr Gyllenhammar was deposed in December 1993 by a shareholder and management
revolt against his plan to merge Volvo car and trucks with France's Renault.
His strategy was then quickly abandoned by Volvo's new board, chaired by
Bert-Olof Svanholm of ABB and including Bjorn Svedberg of S-E Banken, both
from the Wallenberg 'sphere'. Instead, Volvo decided to sell off SKr40bn of
non-core investments.
The Wallenbergs, back on the offensive after the recession, moved swiftly.
Within a week of Volvo announcing its strategic U-turn in the spring,
Incentive bought out Volvo's controlling shareholding in Cardo, an
investment group which included Gambro, a medical equipment supplier that
matched the Wallenbergs' evolving focus on technology-based growth
industries for future investment.
'The Wallenbergs manoeuvred marvellously over Volvo after the Renault deal
collapsed,' says the chief executive of one of Sweden's top non-Wallenberg
companies. 'They got Volvo where they wanted it without paying a penny and
now they are carving it up.'
Mr Peter Wallenberg rejects any suggestion that he deliberately sought to
exploit the Gyllenhammar debacle. But it is unarguable that events since
have enhanced the Wallenberg dominance.
A principal strength of the Wallenbergs has been their record in choosing
skilled managers, who in turn have benefited from having dedicated owners
who understand international markets and invest for the long term.
Another factor that is often underestimated is the determination of Peter
Wallenberg himself, who succeeded his formidable father Marcus in 1982
despite the latter's dim view of his ability to become a leader with 'ice in
his belly'. Mr Wallenberg still talks bitterly of the way he was written off
in his early days in charge, when now-forgotten 1980s whizz-kids were
circling his vulnerable empire.
'I am surprised when people say 'this is the beginning of the end',' he
says. 'Do you think we are just sitting here looking at things going wrong?'
He clearly feels his job is still not complete. Asked what challenges
remain, he says: 'To prove that we are not as vulnerable as some people seem
to believe. I think that is very important.'
The first task now may well be to conduct some internal reorganisation. The
group's structure, concentrated round Investor and Incentive, an industrial
operating group, looks cumbersome. For example, profits from Asea Brown
Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering giant half-owned by Asea, must first
swill through Asea and Incentive before they reach Investor.
Saab-Scania, which is 100 per cent owned by Investor, may also be re-shaped.
Few would be surprised if the company was either re-listed or if some of its
defence and vehicle operations ended up in joint venture partnerships
mirrored on the collaboration with General Motors at Saab Automobile.
But there are other challenges on the horizon which will test the next
generation - Jacob and Marcus, working respectively in senior posts in S-E
Banken and Investor.
Most obvious, perhaps, is the financial markets' perception that the
Wallenberg portfolio of companies is over-dependent on low-growth cyclical
industries.
Even under the dual-share structure, which acts as a built-in defence
against an outside takeover, the empire could yet prove vulnerable to
foreign predators - especially given the deregulation of the Swedish share
market in recent years.
To counter any impression of vulnerability, the Wallenbergs stress they are
again on the offensive, looking for opportunities in growth industries and
casting their gaze more outside Sweden.
Senior family members talk of an 'evolution' in the sphere in which their
traditional willingness to take a long-term view is preserved. But there are
signs that financial deregulation is putting pressure on the companies to
concentrate more on maximising investors' short-term returns.
One dramatic step has already been taken, in Incentive's Dollars 1bn bid in
May to gain control of Gambro, the medical equipment specialist. Incentive
then sold its controlling share in Esab, the world's biggest welding
equipment supplier, to Charter of the UK. The swap tilted Incentive
decisively away from a traditional cyclical industry to a fast-growing
technology sector. The trend will continue, says Mikael Lilius, Incentive's
chief executive.
The Wallenbergs have also in recent months talked of looking abroad for new
investments as part of the evolution. Sweden is chronically short of
'growth' companies, and the family is also conscious of the political
sensitivities that attach to their dominance of the corporate sector. Peter
Wallenberg says: 'This is a rather small country and industrially we
represent a rather sizeable share. I think we must be observant of the world
around us.'
Investor has said it envisages building up its foreign portfolio to 10 per
cent of the group's total investments. A start was made through the
Export-Invest takeover, which brought Investor holdings in Roche, the Swiss
pharmaceuticals group, and Alcatel Alsthom of France. The group is also
paying closer attention to South-East Asia and the Far East in its trawl for
investment opportunities.
This is bound to intensify questions about the underlying industrial logic
of the Wallenberg sphere. The loose-knit nature of the empire makes the
individual companies stronger, family members insist. 'I don't even know
whether Saab or Scania is buying SKF ball-bearings for their cars and
trucks,' says Peter Wallenberg, 'The basic situation between these
industries is arms' length. No deals or favours for one another.'
Outsiders conclude that the driving force of the empire is more the family's
determination to keep control than about creating value. 'The thing they
care most about is protecting their heritage,' says one Swedish corporate
financier.
The Investor investment record suggests there is something to this view. Its
share portfolio has done better than the Stockholm stock exchange in six of
the last 10 years and its annual total yield (defined as dividends plus
share price appreciation) has averaged 17.2 per cent, compared with 15.0 per
cent for the stock exchange. But the outperformance is entirely due to
Astra, the high-flying pharmaceuticals group.
Elsewhere, the Wallenbergs have often been prepared to pay a high price to
retain control, as when Investor paid a hefty premium to buy out Sven Olof
Jahansson, a financier who had built up a 22 per cent stake in Saab-Scania
and demanded a seat on the board.
There are also doubts as to whether they are prepared to take the
hard-headed decisions needed to re-shape the empire significantly away from
its dependence on low-growth industries. The empire did sell its entire
stake in packaging company Alfa Laval to rival Tetra Pak in 1991. But as one
ex-Wallenberg director says: 'You can't see Peter Wallenberg selling out of
Atlas Copco (the engineering group) where he worked for 25 years.'
With an average of 25 per cent of the capital of Wallenberg companies now in
foreign hands, the empire is far more susceptible to this kind of assessment
than in the past. The perception that a company is not delivering maximum
returns could lead to greater share price volatility  - perhaps even
takeover bids, although they face the barrier of the weighted share
structure. The tension between such pressures and the Wallenberg's
traditional style is among the many challenges facing Jacob and Marcus
Wallenberg as they prepare for the day when Peter steps down.
A second article will be published tomorrow.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Leading Article: The prize in Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is still not clear that the ceasefire announced yesterday by the Irish
Republican Army is permanent, a necessary condition for political talks
involving Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. But the substance of the
announcement seems unambiguous. There is a widely-held feeling on all sides
in Northern Ireland that a new phase has begun, a turning away from the
violence that has brought misery to nationalists and unionists alike.
That alone is cause for rejoicing. There are few parallels that can be drawn
between Ulster and long-running conflicts in South Africa and the Middle
East. But events in these other places show that, when all sides are
committed to finding a solution, there is a momentum in the peace process
that sweeps away many of the real or imagined obstacles.
That this point appears to have been reached in Northern Ireland is a
tribute to effective co-operation between the UK and Irish governments. Mr
John Major deserves credit for placing a solution in Ulster on his list of
priorities. He has made clear that Britain has no strategic interest in
Northern Ireland apart from protecting the right of its people to determine
their future. He has also taken risks, most notably in conducting secret
exchanges with Sinn Fein leaders. Those risks appear to have paid off,
thanks to his cool determination under fire.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish Taoiseach, has also been prepared to take
risks. In last December's Downing Street Declaration, he acknowledged the
right of the people of Northern Ireland to remain in the UK unless they
decided otherwise. He also undertook to amend the claims in the Irish
constitution to the north - essential in reassuring unionists.
The peace process will not be smooth. There will be those among both the
republican and the 'loyalist' communities who will try to disrupt it. There
may be a breakaway from the IRA, with diehards seeking to continue the
violence. The process will have to survive whatever 'spectaculars' are
thrown up at a time when trust may still be in short supply.
There is also the fear of betrayal among the unionist majority that must be
constantly and convincingly assuaged. It was their opposition that derailed
two previous attempts at constitutional settlements involving the Irish
Republic. The main Unionist party, led by Mr James Molyneaux, has sensibly
accepted the assurances of the Downing Street Declaration on Northern
Ireland's right to self-determination. But the Reverend Ian Paisley's
Democratic Unionists seem to be flirting with the idea that any peace must
involve unacceptable concessions to Dublin.
Now, therefore, is not a time for complacency but for renewed efforts to
maintain the momentum. Mr John Hume, leader of the moderate nationalists,
advises throwing away the formal timetable for bringing Sinn Fein to the
conference table. This advice should be politely turned down. The quarantine
period of three months after a permanent ceasefire is the least that will be
acceptable to the unionists.
But there is scope to provide immediate benefits to all the people of
Northern Ireland that will carry forward the peace process. One priority
must be to scale down the military presence to the minimum level compatible
with protecting all sections from maverick terrorists. Another is to lift
the absurd ban on broadcasting the voices of Sinn Fein members which has
done so much harm to the UK's reputation abroad. A peace process involves a
dialogue, and a dialogue is impossible if one side cannot be heard.
Finally, amendments to articles 2 and 3 of the Irish constitution to remove
the unqualified claims to the north are promised as part of a final
settlement. Bringing forward the changes would bolster unionist confidence.
The ceasefire demands further risks on all sides to win the bigger prize of
lasting peace in Ireland.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Leading Article: German prospect
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany is recovering from recession. But what sort of growth will it manage
in the medium term? That is the question raised by this year's excellent
survey from the OECD. It is an important question, not just for Germany,
which needs rapid growth to cope with the burden of unification, but for
Europe.
East Germany is - and will remain - a huge burden, despite GDP growth of 7.1
per cent last year and an OECD forecast of another 9.1 per cent in 1994.
This growth has only been made possible by net transfers of DM130bn (Pounds
54bn), 4.6 per cent of west German GDP, last year. These transfers, which
amounted to 47 per cent of east German GDP, have made it possible for
exports from the new Lander to be less than a fifth of their imports. The
need for transfers, which this ratio reveals so starkly, is unlikely to
change in the near future.
At least the fiscal damage has been contained. The general government
deficit as a share of GDP is expected to be brought down to 2.9 per cent
this year. Even the overall public sector borrowing requirement is forecast
at 4.6 per cent, not unreasonable in the circumstances. While the ratio of
public debt to GDP will breach the Maastricht treaty guideline of 60 per
cent in 1995, the OECD argues that further increases can be halted by a
'combination of sustained medium-term growth and active programmes of fiscal
consolidation'. But, inevitably, a price has been paid. Germany's effective
tax rate is higher than that of any leading industrialised country, except
France.
For all its strengths, the economy may not be able to bear this burden that
well. The growth of total factor productivity has slowed markedly since the
1960s; unemployment has risen cycle-by-cycle; in the 1980s, productivity in
manufacturing grew at less than half the rate of the European Union as a
whole; the shares of German exports in markets outside the EU have declined
markedly since 1973; and wage costs seem out of line with productivity, by
comparison with the US and Japan.
The German economy is, in short, showing signs of senescence. It needs to be
revitalised, for its own sake and for that of the European economy as a
whole. A combination of tough control over spending, lower taxation and
structural reforms - privatisation and deregulation - is urgently needed.
The OECD report shows the way. Will Germany dare to follow?

FT  01 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Russia withdraws
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's ceremonies, marking the final withdrawal of Russian troops from
Germany and the Baltic states, celebrated the peaceful liberation of central
Europe from the Red Army and drew a line under the second world war. History
has, once again, given Russia and Germany the chief responsibility for the
peace, prosperity and freedom of central Europe.
Fortunately, the Germany that has emerged from two world wars and the Cold
War is a stable, democratic country firmly anchored in Nato and the European
Union. Meanwhile, Russia seems committed to re-integrating itself into the
world economy and repairing the damage caused by 75 years of self-imposed
tyranny. The litmus tests of these countries' future behaviour will be
Moscow's continued willingness to honour the independence of the Baltic
states and united Germany's toleration of post-war frontiers that leave most
of former Pomerania and Prussia in Polish hands.
Russia and Germany have much to gain from growing economic prosperity and
self-confidence in the central European and Baltic states which, all too
often in the past, have been crushed by the machinations of their
neighbours, acting in concert. But the greatest gainer from the decline in
the power and influence of the Red Army could be Russia itself.
Under communist rule the Soviet Union became the most militarised society on
earth. The health and wealth of Soviet citizens were sacrificed in the vain
effort to wear down the west. Now, at last, Russians and citizens of other
former Soviet states have an opportunity to use their talents and resources
to repair the environmental, economic, social, physical and psychological
scars left by the ill-conceived communist experiment.
Nostalgia for the imperial past is misplaced. The decks have been cleared
for Russia to concentrate on its own affairs. So far as its security is
concerned, the main tasks are to keep its nuclear weapons under watchful
control and to replace the sprawling conscript army of the past with a
smaller, better equipped and trained professional force.
The main challenge, however, is to build an economy responsive to consumers,
whose needs were neglected for decades. The old economy produced world-class
rockets but terrible shoes. Russia's military withdrawal from Europe should
free up the men and resources needed to shift the balance at last towards a
productive civilian economy.

Premier Li may be forgiven for thinking that the local press has it in for
him. In the Portuguese colony of Macao, hacks have just landed an
uncomfortable exclusive, c/o the office of General Vasco Rocha Vieira, the
governor.
His officials have compiled a profile of Li, describing him as arrogant and
incompetent. Of course, it was intended for the general only. But you can't
keep a grubby hack down.
Very poor show, not least because the general is now on an eight-day
official trip to China, where today he will meet Li. Even more poor show,
Macao - a Portuguese colony since 1557 - is due to revert to Chinese rule in
1999.
Still, five years should be enough for the general to find himself another
job.

Jimmy Lai, the Hong Kong businessman who was recently forced to relinquish
his position at the helm of retailer Giordano - following a scathing attack
on Li Peng, the Chinese premier - is entering the world of newspapers.
Lai, who already owns Next, the successful weekly where he lambasted Li and
China's communist party, is planning to launch a new Hong Kong daily by next
spring. Rumour has it that he will call it either Apple or Pingguo, which is
Chinese for apple.
Apple, Next . . . sounds familiar. Steve Jobs founded Apple and, after being
forced out, went on to found Next. Lai, an aficionado of philosopher Karl
Popper's The Open Society and its Enemies, is also a fan of Jobs.
Why not save himself the trouble of thinking up titles for the new paper and
just call it Jobs for the Boys?

The UK prime minister, John Major, will soon be getting an extra Pounds 70 a
week (before tax), thanks to the 4.7 per cent pay rise British MPs recently
awarded themselves, taking the prime minister from Pounds 78,292 to Pounds
81,971.
Pretty paltry. His co-celebrant in yesterday's historic Ulster developments,
Irish prime minister Albert Reynolds, is getting a 16.9 per cent increase -
from IRPounds 82,020 to IRPounds 95,920. Irish President Mary Robinson's
salary will rise by 10 per cent to IRPounds 105,512, while ministers and
judges will have to get by with an increase of 17.1 per cent.
Not bad. Mind you, ordinary TDs (Irish MPs), will have to make do with just
3.8 per cent more, taking their annual whack to IRPounds 32,700. Hardly
enough to stand a round in Dublin these days . . .

Getting rid of Tiny Rowland may be easier said than done. It's one thing

persuading him to vacate his office.
Dieter Bock, the German financier determined to sack his joint chief
executive, was recently aghast to find Paul Spicer still firmly installed at
the Lonrho's Cheapside headquarters. The former Lonrho deputy chairman was
supposed to have retired early this year. But apart from having procured
himself a new desk, Spicer was acting as if nothing had changed. Quite how
Bock had overlooked Spicer's continuing presence for so long remains a bit
of a mystery, but, now alert to the problem, he has apparently vowed he will
make future personnel changes stick. We shall see.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At last Italians know whom to thank for saving their country from a bloody
coup d'etat. Why, Umberto Bossi of course, founder of the populist Northern
League. Not that anyone actually knew of a threat of armed rebellion until
the loquacious Bossi spilled the beans to some hacks on Monday.
Back in 1987, 300,000 warlike League supporters were poised to stream down
from the valleys around Bergamo, a hitherto peaceful northern Italian town,
and march on Rome. Their intent? To depose Socialist prime minister Bettino
Craxi. Only the intervention of Bossi The Wise, preaching the wisdom of
democratic opposition as the best tactic for unseating a corrupt old
political regime, saved the day. Ecco, seven years later, Craxi is in exile
in Tunisia, and the League is in government.
Just a slight snag with this heartwarming tale. That year, the League polled
fewer than 28,000 votes in the Bergamo area. Indeed, excluding old people
and children, there were only 667,000 potential warriors living in the
entire province. So how come this fearsome revolt passed unnoticed by either
the local authorities or the bergamaschi themselves?
Yesterday Bossi was furiously denying he had said anything of the sort. But
it had been too good a story to miss and Bossi still graced the front page
of almost every Italian newspaper, while the Bergamo magistrates duly opened
a file on local armed uprisings of the late 1980s.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Ideas for UK healthcare imaginative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MALCOLM COLES and Mr PETER WELCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The government and the Labour party should respond more positively to
the imaginative ideas of Mr Peter Griffiths, former deputy chief executive
of the National Health Service, on the delivery of healthcare ('Bottomley in
row on private healthcare', August 24). The role of government is to ensure
that a 'public' service such as healthcare is available to all, but not
necessarily to supply it via a public sector monopoly.
The delivery of public services should meet three criteria. First, the
services should be provided efficiently. Second, users should have a choice
of providers. Third, service providers should be accountable to their users.
In a simple tax-funded system, however, the supply of services is not
sufficiently driven by the choice of users, let alone accountable to them.
Instead, government chooses what to supply, and the signals which a market
automatically generates are missing. Furthermore, the efficiency of the
provider is difficult to measure. Attention is focused on how much
government spends rather than what the government gets for its money.
The separation of purchaser and provider allows competition among providers
and permits greater measurement of efficiency. However, even in an 'internal
market', such as the NHS operates, the provider is accountable to its
paymaster, not to its user. It is disappointing that the secretary of state
is quoted as saying that trusts should be accountable to her, not to
patients and the local community.
Plans for the future delivery of 'public' services should correct the
imbalance between purchaser and user, and create structures which are
market-driven and socially based. In a recent pamphlet for the Fabian
Society, we put forward ideas for restructuring NHS Trusts, along similar
lines to those of Mr Griffiths. We proposed applying mutual principles to
the delivery of healthcare. Government should guarantee, and subsidise, the
right to membership of a mutually structured healthcare provider. The actual
choice of provider would be left, so far as possible, with the user.
Contrary to perception, most 'private' healthcare is already provided by
mutual suppliers.
Thinking on the delivery of 'public' services needs to be more radical. Mr
Griffiths' contribution to the debate should be welcomed.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Pepped up for the counter-attack: Why drugs companies have
their eyes on the market for non-prescription medicines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
World drugs groups are scrambling for position in the market for drugs that
can be sold without a doctor's prescription. This week's Dollars 2.9bn
acquisition by UK-based SmithKline Beecham of the retail healthcare business
of US pharmaceutical group Sterling Winthrop was the largest, but not the
first in a series of deals by groups jockeying for position in the
'over-the-counter' market.
But in spite of their fashionableness, non-prescription pills are unlikely
to prove a panacea for drugs companies troubled by slowing sales growth that
has resulted from government attempts to curb healthcare costs. While some
may generate long-term profits, the high costs of launching and marketing
products in a competitive sector means many may fail to make decent returns.
For now, the over-the-counter market appears deceptively attractive.
SmithKline Beecham estimates world sales in the market last year rose by 7.1
per cent to Dollars 32.5bn. IMS International, the London market research
company, forecasts the US market should increase from Dollars 17.4bn last
year to Dollars 24.2bn by 1997.
For drugs companies, the non-prescription market offers an opportunity for
growth when other areas of their businesses are under pressure. The
prescription medicines sector expanded by only 4 per cent in 1993, says IMS.
But it is not just the lacklustre performance of other sectors which is
fuelling interest in the over-the-counter market. 'The basic driving force
is the need of governments to rein back healthcare spending,' explains Mr
Chris Weighell, strategic planning manager of IMS International. 'In many
cases, particularly in Europe, health ministries are re-fusing to reimburse
the cost of drugs, forcing patients to pay for the medicines themselves over
the counter.'
The pharmaceuticals companies are also keen to sell formerly
prescription-only medicines over the counter because it allows them to
extend the product life of their drugs. This has become increasingly
important for the drugs groups because patents on half of the 50 top-selling
US medicines will expire in the next four years. Broker Goldman Sachs
estimates that this year alone 17 drugs with combined US annual sales of
Dollars 2.8bn will lose patent protection.
That would be serious in any circumstances - in the past drugs companies
assumed that they would lose 50 per cent of revenues within two years from
drugs whose patents hadexpired - but the impact now is greater. Producers of
identical, non-patented 'generic' drugs are entering markets earlier once
patents expire. The result is a fall in prices: the price of generic
versions of Naprosyn, made by US drugs company Syntex, fell by 95 per cent
after its patents expired in January. Some drugs companies have even
launched generic versions of their own drugs before patent expiry.
To combat such pressures, companies selling patented drugs are trying harder
to market them as over-the-counter products in the run-up to patent expiry.
'If they can create a strong brand, the product can generate revenues for
decades,' says Mr Peter Glynn-Jones, managing director of strategic
development at SmithKline Beecham consumer healthcare.
The pharmaceuticals groups manufacturing prescription-only drugs have an
advantage in the over-the-counter medicines market: 'Critical to the success
of over-the-counter medicine is its prescription-only heritage,' says Mr
John Walsh, president of US group Warner-Lambert's consumer products
division. 'Ten of the top 11 over-the-counter products in the US were
previously prescription-only medicines.'
Among the medicines whose patents expire soon and could, assuming regulatory
approval is granted, be sold without a prescription are some of the world's
top-selling drugs. They include: anti-ulcer drug Zantac, Glaxo's best
selling medicine, and Zovirax, Wellcome's herpes treatment and the world's
fifth largest-selling drug.
The sales potential of such drugs is, in theory, huge: sales of prescription
products have been known to increase more than five-fold. Take
Gyne-Lotrimin, a virtually unknown prescription anti-fungal medicine for
vaginal infections marketed by US company Schering-Plough. Prescription
sales in 1990 were worth only Dollars 22m. A year later, after being
launched as an over-the-counter product, sales reached Dollars 120m.
But in spite of the rapid projected growth for the over-the-counter market,
many drugs groups which want to enter the over-the-counter market do not
have the expertise, international distribution network, or size to succeed.
'The pharmaceutical groups are good at discovery, development and marketing
to doctors. That expertise does not carry over well to over-the-counter,'
says Mr Walsh at Warner-Lambert.
Mr James Dudley, managing director of consultancy James Dudley
International, says: 'Scale is vital. In order to earn a good return on your
investment you have to have a good range of products to reach the shelves of
the pharmacist or supermarket. You also need size to achieve the purchasing
power to swing good deals in consumer advertising.' SmithKline Beecham
bought Sterling Winthrop's business partly because of the latter's expertise
in selling over-the-counter drugs such as Panadol, the world's best-selling
painkiller after aspirin.
Many large groups which have drugs they want to become over-the-counter
products, but which have little presence in the non-prescription market,
have admitted their weakness and set up alliances with companies strong in
consumer marketing. Glaxo and Wellcome have forged separate pacts with
Warner-Lambert. Merck has teamed up with Johnson &amp; Johnson, the US consumer
products group.
Yet such alliances will not guarantee sales success. Despite the growth of
the total over-the-counter market, it is a tough environment. Unlike
Schering-Plough's drug Gyne-Lotrimin, which was launched into a market with
no established rivals, sales of many drugs may not exceed their pre-patent
expiry prescription levels. Aleve, for example, Syntex's over-the-counter
version of Naprosyn, is competing in the competitive market for analgesics
(painkillers). Brokers Lehman Brothers expect it to generate sales in the US
of no more than Dollars 200m a year, compared with prescription sales of
Dollars 1bn last year.
Similarly, the market for indigestion treatments is likely to prove
exacting, with four similar new over-the-counter products being launched
over the next two years. Lehman Brothers predict US non-prescription sales
of SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet will reach only Dollars 150m by 1998. That
compares with pre-patent expiry sales of Dollars 650m last year.
Even if decent sales are achieved, profitability is far from immediate. The
launch and marketing costs are so high that typically products do not break
even for at least three years, says Mr Glynn-Jones.
If profits are made, margins are likely to be less attractive than in the
prescription business. Boots Healthcare International, the non-prescription
business of Boots, the UK retailing and pharmaceuticals group, estimates a
successful over-the-counter company can achieve margins of 15 per cent. In
contrast, brokers James Capel reckon a well-run drugs group can achieve
operating margins of 29.3 per cent.
Such sales and earnings projections, as well as the recent alliances and
acquisitions, assume that prescription products will be cleared by
regulatory authorities for sale over the counter - but at least in the US
such clearance has proved far from automatic. The federal Food and Drug
Administration advisory committees have refused to recommend, at least for
the moment, SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet, Merck's Pepcid, Wellcome's
Zovirax, and Upjohn's Rogaine. They have yet to be convinced the drugs would
be safe and effective when sold over the counter.
In spite of relatively fast market growth, the road to profitable
over-the-counter sales is far from uncertain.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Book Review: Bedrock trade unionism lives on

<TEXT>
THE FUTURE OF THE TRADE UNIONS
By Robert Taylor
Andre Deutsch Pounds 9.99. 238 pages
Since 1979 British trade unions have lost about a third of their members,
and union strength is now concentrated in the public services. Their
membership is particularly weak among women and in business sectors showing
the fastest employment growth.
At the same time, union political power has been much weakened. The
abolition of National Economic Development Office and other tripartite
bodies has cut them out of much decision-making. And Tony Blair has clearly
stated unions will not have a privileged position in relation to a future
Labour government.
It is not surprising, then, that there should be a debate about whether the
movement has a future, in anything like its present form.
The Future of the Trade Unions presents the case for the defence.
Commissioned by the Trades Union Congress, the book is unashamed in
advocating a strong future role for the unions. There is blush-inducing
praise for general secretaries. We hear a lot of John Monks and Bill Jordan
but, strangely, there is no mention of Arthur Scargill (or Jimmy Knapp),
though John Edmonds is allowed a few observations. Reacting to the fall in
membership he grumbles: 'Working people should be queueing up to join trade
unions.'
But Taylor's case, though highly partial, deserves attention. He says unions
have begun to put their house in order and can look confidently to the
future.
His main reason for optimism is that the European Union is re-establishing a
framework in which trade unions have a privileged position in policy-making.
The 'social dialogue' formalised in the Maastricht treaty requires the
Commission to consult employers and unions on projected social legislation.
Agreements reached by the social partners can be adopted by the Council of
Ministers.
When this procedure was first tried - over European works councils - it did
not result in agreement. Yet the Social Affairs Council seems likely to
implement a directive establishing such councils, now called European
committees, in big European companies (many with UK parents). British unions
see a re-entry point here. As Taylor says in summarising his second
argument: The EU has provided not just 'a lifeline for the trade unions, but
the means for a potentially effective counter-offensive by organised labour
for the rest of the 1990s'.
His third argument is that the key to enhanced competitiveness is consensus
in the workplace and unions are the path to this consensus.
It sounds persuasive. So why are most employers still unconvinced that
institutionalised works councils will help their businesses? And why do many
prefer routes to better communication with their workforces which do not
pass through union channels?
There are two main reasons. First, UK employers note that elsewhere in
Europe works councils are not exclusively union-based structures. In France,
'enterprise committees' represent the whole workforce. While union
representation is often prominent, unionisation is remarkably weak. Yet many
British trade unionists talk as if European works councils will re-establish
unions' exclusivity. Mr Edmonds has said bluntly: 'If we succeed, works
councils would become our dream solution to the problem of declining trade
union power.'
Taylor himself points out that instances in which the trade union is the
single channel of representation are not compatible with support for
universal civil rights for UK workers on a Continental model. But it is not
clear that the British trade union movement has yet accepted this.
Employers' second concern is that many union leaders seem still to believe
the interests of employers and employees are mutually exclusive. Taylor's
own writing provides two vivid examples.
He contrasts British employers' 'commitment to deregulated labour markets'
with the attitude 'of their European mainland counterparts who have a sense
of social and ethical responsibility for the well-being of their employees'.
Such generalisation is absurd and offensive. He argues, similarly, the
decline of trade union-based collective bargaining means employers have no
'need to behave in a civilised manner towards their workers'. This ignores
the point that well-treated, involved employees will show greater commitment
to a business and be more productive.
There are unscrupulous employers against whom individual employees need
protection. But most companies do not see their relationship with employees
as a zero-sum game. They are keen to develop participation, and surveys show
they are, overall, succeeding.
Employers are, today, not in principle hostile to unions. There is no
evidence that they have forced the pace of union decline through
derecognition. Indeed in the private sector union membership has fallen far
faster than recognition.
And very few employers now say they have been unable to achieve
restructuring because of union obstructionism.
But bad memories die hard, and have been reawakened by the behaviour of RMT,
the transport union, in the rail dispute. (RMT is not mentioned by Taylor.)
So employers will be reluctant to support a more prominent role in
policy-making for trade unions, or Continental-style legislation, until more
union leaders are ready to accept the consequences.
That means greater identification with an enterprise's success and
acceptance of non-union channels. Some in the union movement, notably the
TUC leadership, understand the implications of those choices. But this book
shows there are many Flintstones still on the general council.
The author is director general of the Confederation of British Industry.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Allegations against Body Shop lack
any real evidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBIN BINES and Others
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As environmentalists with knowledge of both the Body Shop and the
ethical sector, we wish to ask why it appears that the FT, along with the
rest of the media, is singling out the company and its credentials for
attack; and largely on the basis of what seem to us to be both unproven
allegations and facts blown out of all proportion.
There can surely be few people who really doubt that the Body Shop is one of
the leading companies in the field of social, ethical and environmental
policy. While there may be companies which will go to greater pains in one
particular sector of business, you would be hard pushed indeed to find
another company which goes as far in almost every aspect of its business.
Which other company even thought of building a wind farm to cover its energy
needs in the UK?
Of course the Body Shop is not perfect. It has its share of disputes with
franchisees, minor spills and business misadventures. It is, however, a good
example of a successful yet caring company with priorities way beyond the
usual profit motive, and in a world where business ethics are all too often
sadly lacking. Yet your critical articles would suggest sizeable problems.
So what purpose do these reports serve in a respectable paper like the FT?
Are they an attempt to engender debate about some of the serious issues
facing business today? Or do they merely perpetuate the cynicism so often
aimed at anyone who tries to inject a real sense of purpose into almost any
field, be it politics, business or the arts?
If there are genuine grounds for complaint, let us hear real evidence. If
not, try attacking companies which have yet even to consider a social,
ethical or environmental policy, let alone implement it.
We desperately need to encourage businesses, consumers and green investors
to develop the kind of ideas that the Body Shop espouses, and to put them
into practice. Articles like those in your pages over the last few days can
only make them all wonder whether it is really worth the effort.

Sir, I would question the statement in your news item 'End of the line'
(August 27) about the last button A and B pay phone being in the Shetland
Isles.
During a sailing holiday to the Small Isles in the Inner Hebrides my husband
and I visited the island of Soay off the south coast of Skye. There, on
August 1 1994, we saw a telephone box with buttons A and B and powered by
solar panels. I suspect it is still there.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KENNETH WHIPPLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Frances Williams missed a critical point in the article, 'Unfinished
Business in Uruguay Round' (August 16). She characterised ongoing
negotiations on financial services as '. . . in essence a bilateral argument
between the US and Japan . . .' From the US financial community's
perspective, this is incorrect.
While it is true that some segments of the US financial service sector still
face market access and national treatment issues in Japan, many of the
significant problems confronting US financial services providers are in the
developing markets of Asia. Simply stated, US financial markets remain wide
open to entry by foreign financial firms. On the other hand, US financial
firms face barriers limiting their ability to penetrate markets abroad. In
many promising markets, they are prohibited from establishing or expanding
operations. Other problems run the spectrum from denial of access to local
debt markets to discriminatory or unpublished licensing procedures.
Singling out Japan misses the point of the financial services negotiations -
a successful financial services agreement must achieve substantial
liberalisation across a wide range of commercially important countries. At
the conclusion of the round in 1993, virtually no meaningful commitments had
been made. Acceptance of offers on the table would have locked US financial
markets permanently open while foreign markets would have remained closed.
CSI Financial Services, a private sector coalition of US financial firms and
associations, remains committed to the position it has taken throughout the
negotiations - open access to all financial markets sets the foundation for
increased economic growth and job creation. That was the goal of the Uruguay
Round, and continues to be the goal of the services negotiations.

ITV's appeal these days is to the innate conservatism of the British public:
nothing here will shock or surprise you, everything is utterly familiar, any
new series will look exactly like an old series. This evening they begin
with a 22-year-old soap, Emmerdale, (7.00); move on to a 33-year-old nature
series, Survival, devoted today to animals that fly (7.30); then to an
episode of The Bill which began a mere 10 years ago (8.00). Downwardly
Mobile is yet another crass house-sharing sitcom (8.30); People Like Us yet
another lip-gloss mini-series from the US (9.00 and 10.40); and News At 10
is, well, News At 10. If you use television instead of Horlicks this should
do the trick. BBC1 and BBC2 are stuffed with repeats, ranging from The
Protectors, (11.50 BBC1) which was launched on ITV 22 years ago, to a nature
series, Realms Of The Russian Bear, which natural history freaks can zap
into the moment 'Survival' ends on ITV (8.00 BBC2). BBC2 alone has four
repeats tonight, but the best is on BBC1: the episode of French And Saunders
in which the girlies deliver a brilliant parody of the BBC's own 'House Of
Eliott' (9.30).

THE HUDSUCKER PROXY (PG) Joel Coen
WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN (15) Luis Mandoki
THE SLINGSHOT (12) Ake Sandgren
BOSNA] Bernard-Henri Levy
If you can imagine Death Of A Salesman gift-wrapped for Christmas by Frank
Capra - and I sympathise if you cannot - you will have an idea of The
Hudsucker Proxy.
The film-making Coen brothers, writer-director Joel and writer-producer
Ethan, have long been threatening to make an overblown, under-conceived
movie. Blood Simple was a modest but punch-packing murder thriller; Raising
Arizona was a slight but funny baby-napping comedy; Miller's Crossing was a
rich, labyrinthine, intermittently barmy tale of American-Irish gangster
wars. Then came Barton Fink, stylish, bloated, loved by the French and
beginning to hint at major vacuity. Now we have The Hudsucker Proxy, a
whimsical enormity in which the brothers' whole creative operation seems to
have been surrendered to their production designer, Dennis Gassner and his
numerous assistants.
Size and show have been used to cover up the pinbrained premise. Amid
over-rich sets - every room looks like Grand Central Station, every actor
seems to be drowning in the ochre-and-twilight light - we watch a fable of
man's greedy quest for enrichment. Takeovers threaten Hudsucker Industries,
New York, after the suicide of their chairman just before Christmas, 1958.
We see this in flashback: Waring Hudsucker (Charles Durning) taxi-ing for
take-off on the boardroom table before flying through the window.
Can his aide and next-in-line Sidney Mussburger (Paul Newman) lower the
company's stock, thereby enabling the board to buy control? And might not
the best way to effect that devaluation be to appoint a nincompoop as
chairman?
Enter mailboy Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins), upon which everything goes
according to plan. The movie's moral plan, that is, not Newman's money plan.
Norville sends the stock skyrocketing with his first theoretically silly
invention - the hula hoop (all resemblances to real history . . . ) - and by
the close he is announcing something even more stupid called a frisbee.
Between the crunching ironies about small dreams triumphing in the teeth of
repressive corporate ambition, our hero is visited and romanced by a
character we can only call the Ghost of Screwball Heroines Past. She is
reporter Amy Archer, played by Jennifer Jason Leigh as if the Coens had sat
her down at a phonograph with records of Katharine Hepburn and Jean Arthur
and told her to stay until she could do them both to a turn.
A 'turn' is what the poor actress then gives us. We feel our minds' ears
being dragged through Mr Smith Goes To Washington and Mr Deeds Goes To Town
and Bringing Up Baby, as if not only were there no tomorrow but today had
been forced at gunpoint to turn into yesterday.
Everything in The Hudsucker Proxy is nostalgic pastiche: from the
corny-sumptuous Khachaturian music (recognisable to ex-addicts of TV's The
Onedin Line) to the lovingly mocked-up skyscrapers embossed with giant
clocks, out of Citizen Kane by Harold Lloyd. As for the film's
David-versus-Goliath view of industrial politics, it is stuck around the
year of Fritz Lang's Metropolis.
The Coens play their capitalism-trashing fable for comedy not epic
melodrama; but its simplifications still seem retarded. In this world
everyone who holds power (Newman) or gains power (Robbins) becomes corrupt.
'Little' ideas are the truly durable ones. And only the love of a good woman
can hope to turn our hero from the path of moral degeneration. Sad,
sententious, time-warped. Wake me up when the Coen brothers reach 1994.
*****
Hollywood has traditionally been reluctant to make films about alcoholism,
writes Stephen Amidon. When drunks do appear on screen, they are usually
used for either comic relief or a quick shot of pathos. Eliciting sympathy
for the addict is a tricky business, requiring the genius of a Jack Lemmon
or a Michael Keaton. Far better to afflict your hero with a less problematic
disease.
The makers of When a Man Loves a Woman seem to have lost sight of this fact,
creating a wino weepie that never really engages the audience's sympathy. In
it, yuppie Alice Green (Meg Ryan) tries to kick her quart-a-day Vodka habit
at an exclusive clinic, while her hunky, caring husband (Andy Garcia) looks
after their angelic kids in a San Francisco dream home, aided by a diligent
ethnic nanny. Setting aside the obvious cavil that if someone who looked
like Meg Ryan drank a quart of Stoli a day she would not look much like Meg
Ryan, it would still take a rare film indeed to make us care for such a
pampered character.
Unfortunately, director Luis Mandoki tries to push all our pity buttons
without first earning our respect. He, along with writers Ronald Bass and Al
Franken, would have us believe that their heroine merely catches alcoholism
as she might 'flu. It doesn't wash. Kicking the bottle certainly has its
heroic elements, but they are of a different order than those found in, say,
terminal cases. Ryan is at a loss to portray a character for whom hitting
bottom means taking a baby step down the social ladder, while Andy Garcia is
equally at sea as her beleaguered spouse. Only Ellen Burstyn as Ryan's
acerbic mother can inject some realistic passion into the film, suggesting
that somebody might be to blame for this boozing after all.
*****
The Slingshot is one of those perfectly pitched coming-of-age stories that
the Swedish film industry churns out with alarming regularity. Set in 1920s
Stockholm, it follows the exploits of Roland, a poor yet resourceful
12-year-old who wins friends by using the condoms his progressive parents
distribute to make slingshots.
Director Ake Sandgren's touch is as light as a feather, allowing him to
modulate scenes of ribald anarchy and gentle emotion without ever hitting a
wrong note. Lesser talents would have turned the prophylactic weaponry into
the film's centrepiece, but Sandgren wisely keeps it just one of many
arresting images of youth. And it is a measure of the director's ironic
sensibility that when Roland finally escapes poverty for his childhood
paradise, his destination turns out to be a reform school.
Bernard-Henri Levy's Bosna] is an old-style polemic whose maker would like
nothing better than to have its audience storm out of the ICA, rush across
The Mall and besiege the Foreign Office, demanding something be done about
the situation in Bosnia. Levy spent several months in the Balkans last year,
collecting imagery too powerful for the TV news - snipers at work, the
aftermath of bombings and beheadings, and one unforgettable scene of a
concentration camp inmate dying of shock after being given his first drink
of water in three days.
Levy argues that the Bosnian government's fate is a political situation
which the west has cravenly transformed into a humanitarian crisis. It is a
compelling point, though the director's unchecked partisanship hinders his
argument. The Serbs are referred to as 'scum' and at no time are they asked
to give their side of the story, weak as it may be. NATO's recent air
strikes, meanwhile, undercut Levy's accusations of western inaction. That
said, this remains a disturbing documentary that should shame everyone who
claims to suffer from compassion fatigue.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Arts: Lindsay Anderson - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN AMIDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lindsay Anderson, who died in France on Tuesday, was among the small group
of directors who in the 1950s and 1960s transformed British cinema from a
blinkered guardian of the nation's institutions into a sharply satirical
mirror of its many ills.
Along with his 'Free Cinema' colleagues Tony Richardson and Karel Reisz,
Anderson spearheaded a national film movement which rivalled its French and
American counterparts for intelligence and trenchant social analysis.
Current lamentations about the sad state of the British movie industry
almost inevitably point to Anderson's work as the ideal so rarely attained
nowadays.
Born in Bangalore in 1923 into a Scottish military family, Anderson served
with the Army Intelligence Corps in the second world war before entering
Oxford, where he edited the influential film journal, Sequence. Upon
graduation he pursued a career as a film critic for such publications as New
Statesman, Sight and Sound and The Observer, platforms he used to rail
against the conformity and anaemia of British film-making.
Before long, Anderson began to make films himself, cutting his teeth on a
series of respected short documentaries that concluded with his Academy
Award winning Thursday's Children in 1955. During this period, Anderson also
distinguished himself as a theatre director at the Royal Court as well as
directing five episodes of the famous Robin Hood series for television.
Anderson's career in feature films began spectacularly in 1963 with This
Sporting Life, a powerful examination of celebrity and class dynamics in
which Richard Harris portrayed a social-climbing rugby player. Although
firmly in the tradition of the Angry Young Man school of gritty realism,
Anderson's first film distinguished itself through a crisp anecdotal style
gleaned from his years as a documentary maker.
The director's next triumph was his public school masterpiece If .. (1968),
a quintessential study of 1960s alienation and surely one of the greatest
youth rebellion films of all time. That film's star, Malcolm MacDowell, was
again featured in the final instalment of Anderson's informal trilogy of
decay in British life, O Lucky Man] (1973), a technically-brilliant and
blackly funny account of capitalism gone mad. In all these films the rigid
institutions that held British society together were subjected to a brutal
analysis, while at the same time an anarchic, emotional humanity was
unabashedly triumphant. Though heavily schooled in theory, Anderson was
above all else a visceral, instinctive talent who came to have little time
for the visual technocrats currently masquerading as the avant garde of
British film-making.
Anderson's later work never quite reached the dizzying heights he achieved
in his first decade of feature film-making. Britannia Hospital (1982), a
scathing satire of the NHS, had its memorable moments, though the deftness
of comic touch that marked its predecessors was missing. And The Whales of
August (1987), Anderson's only American film, was a sentimental drama of the
first order that nevertheless had little to do with the dizzying darkness of
his previous work. During this period he also continued to direct for the
stage and television (most recently he returned to the National Theatre last
year to direct a sell-out production of David Storey's new play Stages) as
well as to act, most notably his portrayal alongside John Gielgud of an
anti-Semitic Cambridge don in Chariots of Fire.
In 1947, reflecting on the controversy surrounding Powell and Pressburger's
The Life and Times of Colonel Blimp, Anderson remarked that 'perhaps the
tendency is to treat the films of one's own country like its prophets - with
less than justice.' It is a mark of Lindsay Anderson's contribution as a
director that it would be difficult for any justly-minded filmgoer to deny
that his oracular, trenchant and altogether unique vision is one that
remains unsurpassed in his nation's cinematic tradition.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Arts: Armstrong's Last Goodnight - Theatre in Edinburgh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Nationalists who have been complaining about the paucity of native
culture in the official Edinburgh Festival may be appeased by a slice of
Scots history from an English playwright. Certainly, Armstrong's Last
Goodnight by John Arden, unveiled at the Lyceum Theatre 30 years after its
Glasgow premiere is a tough experience for non-Caledonians. Most of it,
conducted in an accent that makes Rab C. Nesbitt sound like Brian Sewell, is
unintelligible; and when intelligible, uninteresting.
The story is set on the Anglo-Scots marches, among the reivers, those
freebooting lairds who cocked a snook at authorities on both sides of the
border; cattle-rustlers, pillagers and gangsters whose favourite form of
protection money came in the original 'black mail'. The central character is
John Armstrong of Gilnockie, a historical figure in the time of James V and
his uncle Henry VIII. His execution by the Scottish king is the subject of
an old ballad. The modern playwright has fleshed out this violent episode
with what I suspect are reflections on the nature of politics, trust,
responsibility and probably nouvelle cuisine, DIY and formula one racing for
all I could gather from the incomprehensible dialogue.
What is clear from William Gaskill's indeterminate direction is that
characterisation is almost totally absent. The play is less a think piece
than a talk piece. For the most part these are pawns who come on, talk
politics and walk off. When something more engaging is called for the result
is embarrassing. The courtesan mistress of the smoothie troubleshooter and
man of letters Sir David Lindsay is a terrible cliche, and so Alison Peebles
plays her, strenuously roguish, hand on hip, with much swishing of skirts
and knowing oeuillades at the audience.
Fairly typical of the writing's inability to rise to the theatrical
challenge is the scene where the roistering Armstrong and his followers are
revealed as converts to a reforming evangelist, with no hint of how, when or
why these bandits turned into witnesses of faith that Billy Graham would be
proud of. The conversion has been done off-stage with the chastity of a an
ancient Greek disaster. On second thoughts perhaps one should be thankful.
The ideas are not only banal but confused: sophisticated realpolitik is set
against - what? For the main weakness of this production is the void at its
centre. Stuart Hepburn's dowdy Armstrong is so glumly uncharismatic as to
verge on the invisible. His final tragedy, lured to a treacherous end in his
finery with the king's false safe-conduct, leaves the impression of the
death of a strutting clown since it has been preceded by no characterisation
whatever.
The vast cast-list suggests that Arden had seen Osborne's Luther - there are
hints of an attempt at the same historic scope, which may have prompted the
1965 National Theatre production with Albert Finney. That must have been
more gripping. Or more decipherable.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Putting price before
conscience - A look at a Japanese printer campaign in which environmental
concerns have lost out to cost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kazuo Inamori, founder and chairman of Kyocera, the Japanese high-technology
ceramics company, is an iconoclast with a reputation for promoting
tomorrow's orthodoxy today.
This year, however, he has been forced to abandon advertising based on the
environmentally sound qualities of Kyocera printers in favour of a punchier,
cost of ownership campaign. 'Green' is not yet the colour of the month for
hard-headed office equipment buyers, it seems.
Inamori's far-sightedness is legendary. A decade ago, he was the first to
exploit the ending of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone's telecommunications
monopoly, setting up a carrier which has become the leader among Japan's new
public telecommunications operators.
He has overseen Kyocera's diversification from its base in semiconductor
casings into computer games, cameras and, more recently, page printers.
These are relatively inexpensive machines, typically costing around Pounds
1,500, designed for use with personal computers. They offer a combination of
high print quality and economic operation and have become the workhorse of
today's networked data processing.
The page printer market is dominated by Hewlett-Packard, the US electronics
giant. Its Laserjet machines command a 60 per cent market share, leaving a
handful of competitors, among them Canon, Kyocera and Oki, scrambling for
the rest.
Kyocera has been looking to raise its world-wide market share from about 6
per cent at present to around 15 per cent. Today it competes only in the
market for machines printing at least 10 pages a minute. Later this year it
will introduce a four-page-a-minute model which it hopes will double its
market share.
In seeking to expand further, however, it faces fierce marketing challenges,
among them overcoming the power of a spectacularly successful brand. HP sets
the pace in the computer industry. It is a byword for quality electronics
and the name is essentially synonymous with laser printers. Customers ask
for HP printers without going into the competitive differences between
machines. And dealers, selling a commodity product with a low profit margin,
find little incentive to promote other makers' offerings. It is, according
to Philip Murphy, general manager of Kyocera Electronics (UK), a
'self-perpetuating connivance' which works to the disadvantage of HP's
competitors.
Printer technology, furthermore, is not intrinsically exciting to customers
looking only for convenience and reliability. HP's machines are powered by
laser technology licensed from Canon of Japan. Kyocera has a competitive
technology which uses light emitting diodes. Both technologies involve
'writing' on a rotating drum which, in turn, transfers an electric charge to
paper to attract toner in the shape of the characters to be printed.
Kyocera's 'green' campaign, launched last November at a worldwide cost of
about Pounds 8m, exploited the fact that the laser printer drum mechanism -
the cartridge - is designed for disposal. When the toner runs out, the
cartridge must be replaced. There is a saving on maintenance costs at the
expense of the price of a new cartridge.
Manufacturers of laser printers receive a steady income from the sale of
these consumables. And the cartridge has to be disposed of. Kyocera says
that by the end of 1994, laser printers will have used 300m cartridges - 'a
new variety of noxious, non-biodegradable landfill' its advertising claims.
Its own machines, it says, simply have to have their toner replenished.
'How to save the world from your office' was the slogan Kyocera used to
advertise its Ecosys range of printers. Even at street prices they work out
more expensive in capital cost than their HP equivalents: 'You should tell
your customers there is no greater investment than saving the Earth,'
Inamori told his senior mangers. The campaign was aimed at increasing
awareness of the Kyocera brand. But the business world is clearly not yet
ready to embrace greenness as a criterion for printer purchase. 'Perhaps
next year' was a typical response from potential customers.
This spring, with the slogan 'the page printer that prints money', Kyocera
in the UK switched to a new campaign based on data collected by Context, a
London-based marketing consultancy. Its analysis suggests that over the life
of a printer, the cost of consumables - paper, toner, new cartridges - is
more significant than the purchase price.
It concludes: 'Kyocera is able to lead the field in terms of overall cost of
ownership through its adoption of a long-life developer and drum assembly
unit which has a life of 300,000 pages.' Kyocera claims costs of 0.5p a page
compared with 1.9p a page for competing systems. Its rivals dispute these
figures.
Will this latest campaign be successful? The photocopier market is familiar
with the concept of cost per page but it is new to the printer business.
Most companies neither know nor measure their printing costs. And different
managers may be responsible for capital spending and spending on
consumables. The market may have to go through some sharp re-education if
Kyocera is to get its message across.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A costly presence -
New research into the price of promoting and maintaining brands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   BY ALAN MITCHELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even before the great soap war erupted this summer between Unilever and
Procter &amp; Gamble, the two companies were together expected to spend more
than Pounds 75m in 1994 advertising and promoting their Persil and Ariel
brands in the UK.
That is more than last year's total annual sales of Britain's 28th biggest
grocery brand, Felix catfood. On its own, Persil's 1993 marketing and
advertising expenditure of around Pounds 38m was equivalent to the total
supermarket and high street grocery sales of Cadbury's Dairy Milk chocolate,
and Ariel's Pounds 35m to the total grocery sales of Schweppes mixers.
Such can be the cost of maintaining and refreshing a top grocery brand - a
cost which is making it prohibitive even for many household names to sustain
their special place in consumers' hearts by using traditional marketing
strategies.
Economies of scale are making life hard even for medium-sized brands. The
average cost of maintaining a top 10 brand last year was Pounds 15m, about 7
per cent of sales. But for the top 70 as a whole it was Pounds 8m, more than
10 per cent of sales, according to a new study by Added Value, a marketing
consultancy. For the first time, its research estimates both advertising and
normally hidden 'below the line' expenditure figures. The latter covers
direct marketing, sales promotion, trade promotions and public relations.
'Many brands have an uphill struggle to enter the mainstream,' comments
Rahul Sen, a manager at Added Value. 'If they can create critical mass then
the ratio of advertising and promotion expenditure to sales falls rapidly.
But if the marketing is not quite working, the ratio becomes very high.'
Sen suggests that marketers in many categories of product are too influenced
by competitors' expenditure and advertising patterns, rather than
concentrating on what is needed to build a credible overall presence. Only a
few can afford to create that presence on television. He adds: 'The question
is what happens to the rest. A lot of small brands will die.'
Sen's gloomy predictions are backed by as yet unpublished research conducted
by OC&amp;C Strategy Consultants earlier this year. For one of the top 10 food
companies, the marketing costs of a typical food product launch - currently
running at an average Pounds 3m - will take 2 per cent of operating profits,
says Michael Jary, OC&amp;C director. But for a company ranking 31-40 they will
account for 27 per cent of profits. For one between 51 and 60 they will
gobble up 84 per cent.
'Escalating marketing costs suggest that fewer products are getting
sufficient support during launch to create a defensible franchise,' says
Jary. 'You don't have to be too far down the league before you can't launch
a new product.'
Companies have already developed branding and marketing strategies which
respond to these cost pressures. For example, all commercials for Cadbury
chocolates carry the corporate name; the budget is then evenly spread across
selected brands, including Crunchie bars. Others, such as Bournville
chocolate, are not advertised at all.
Marketers at Unilever's Birds Eye Walls subsidiary now have a strict
umbrella branding policy whereby all the company's advertising is designed
to enhance the standing of its various sub-brands, and all new product
advertising is equally designed to 'freshen' the Birds Eye image. Says John
Sharpe, Birds Eye Walls' chairman: 'With the costs of supporting and
developing a brand you have got to look for the best synergies.' Even so, he
adds, 'we are definitely removing support from certain products to
concentrate resources on priority brands, and we are also having to
rationalise our product range'.
'Most companies just cannot afford to keep their whole load of brands fresh,
so they are trimming, cutting their tail-end brands off,' comments John
Brady, head of the consumer goods and retail practice of McKinsey, the
management consultancy. This, he points out, is 'emotionally a very hard
thing to do. But if you assign all relevant costs - not just advertising and
promotion spends - you often find they are losing you money'.
Now, however, some marketers are realising that even the synergies generated
by portfolio rationalisation and classic umbrella branding may no longer be
enough. Next month, for example, the first corporate brand-building campaign
for Heinz should appear on Britain's television screens. Heinz has decided
to withdraw all product advertising from television to concentrate its
resources on direct marketing. Television will be for the corporate brand
alone.
This is not because the company is now a rumoured takeover target, but
because of the more mundane dilemma highlighted by Added Value's research.
With an advertising budget of Pounds 15m, Heinz had an average of just
Pounds 0.8m to support each of its leading categories, such as baked beans,
soups, baby foods and ketchups. It would have been 'a Herculean task' for
Heinz to support its 350 separate variants on television, agrees a
spokesman. 'There was no way we could do it. We reached a point where it was
time for us to review our whole marketing strategy.'
Heinz's rethink and Added Value's research suggest that for those many
brands whose total sales struggle to keep pace with the marketing spends of
'power brands' such as Persil and Ariel, more such 'put up or shut up'
decisions will have to be made.
Comments Roger Ramsden of the Boston Consulting Group. 'Most companies are
reappraising their brand portfolios as a consequence of the cost of
maintaining their brand presence. Many are beginning to include private
label production (for retailers) in their plans.'
That is the shut-up choice. The put-up alternative? Says Sen: 'If you have
classical television-led brand management and you only have Pounds 1m-Pounds
2m to spend, you are likely to lose. So you have to look at non-conventional
methods to avoid the costs of entry.' Heinz has chosen a database marketing
route.
Muller, the sensation of the UK yoghurt market, forced its way into the
branded goods charts by ploughing all its marketing budget into distribution
 -offering retailers margins they could not refuse, notes Jary.
As the cost of branding combines in a pincer movement with rising retailer
power, more grocery brand marketers will have to develop similarly
innovative strategies.

Mark Malloch Brown, 40, a former journalist on The Economist, has been given
the job of repairing the image of the Washington-based World Bank, which is
celebrating its fiftieth anniversary this year.
A British national who created and edited The Economist Development Report,
he has been appointed director of external affairs, reporting to World Bank
president Lewis Preston. He replaces Alexander Shakow who becomes senior
adviser in the Bank's operations policy department.
The Bank has come under increasing attack over the last couple of years.
Those on the right argue that the markets can take over its role as investor
in developing countries. Others argue that the Bank's programmes have hurt
rather than helped the poor. The decline in the Bank's image has been partly
blamed on its inability to get its message across.
Malloch Brown's media skills have been honed in some of the world's toughest
trouble spots. During his time with the United Nations High Commission for
Refugees he was responsible for establishing camps for Cambodian refugees.
Other jobs have included advising the presidential campaigns of Cory Aquino
in the Philippines and Mario Vargas Llosa in Peru.
He currently heads the international practice of Robinson Lake Sawyer
Miller, a Washington political consultancy.

Preston, who joined the group in 1990, is currently the operations director.
In his new role he will run the group on a day-to-day basis and take some of
the weight off the shoulders of Nicholas Oppenheim, the group's vice
chairman. Oppenheim had got more heavily involved in the company's affairs

At the FT, he helped develop the paper's coverage of social affairs.
In 1984 he decided to study law, and was called to the Bar in 1986.
But a summer relief job with the public relations agency Carl Byoir

FT  01 SEP 94 / Technology: Cutting the cord - Japan's handy phone system
may become the pan-Asian standard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PATTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government of Hong Kong this summer became the first outside Japan to
opt for Japan's Personal Handy Phone System. Hong Kong's decision to go
ahead with PHS instead of rival systems even precedes Japan's formal
adoption of its own system.
Not that there are any doubts that PHS - the latest attempt to provide
wireless personal communications at costs low enough for most people in
developed nations - will begin operations in Japan early next year. Most
Japanese consumer electronics manufacturers (including Toshiba, Sanyo,
Casio, Mitsubishi, Nippondenso, Aiwa, JVC, Kenwood and Sony) have produced
telephones for the new system and Matsushita has had a PHS-compatible
cordless phone on the market since April.
Japan's government is developing a proposal which, if accepted by its
neighbours, will make PHS the pan-Asian standard for wireless
communications.
It would be hard to come up with an example of a product that has generated
so much enthusiasm and national commitment so far ahead of official
approval, let alone market acceptance. PHS may just turn out to be the
'killer product' that Japan's high-technology industries need to disperse
the clouds over the Japanese economy since the boom of the late 1980s.
The roots of the PHS concept can be traced back to the first cordless
telephones of the 1970s. Dubbed CT1, these early attempts to cut the cord
were limited to a range of only a few yards. But the second generation CT2
technology gave cordless telephone users a wider range of several hundred
feet. PHS aims to break the constraints and allow users to roam anywhere
within a few hundred feet of cell stations installed and operated by service
providers.
There have been previous attempts to achieve that goal, including the
Telepoint system tried with little success in the UK and Hong Kong and the
Digital European Cordless Telecommunications (DECT) system.
Hong Kong's geography is particularly well suited to PHS technology, which
is based on much smaller cells than existing cellular telephone systems.
Countries such as the US or Australia have large areas that must either be
covered with large numbers of unprofitable cell stations or left as holes in
the system.
The small area of Hong Kong, on the other hand, requires a relatively small
number of cells for complete coverage. Japan is aiming for only 50 per cent
coverage of its population in the first five years of the PHS service.
When used near its base station, a personal handy phone functions as a
cordless telephone and is billed as if it were any other home or office
telephone. Out of range, however, the handy phone switches to the nearest
cell station. Like a cellular phone, it can originate or receive calls as
long as it remains within range of a cell station, but it cannot be used in
cars and other fast-moving vehicles.
In return for that shortcoming, it enjoys two important benefits. The first
is drastically reduced cost: calls can be made and received at about a third
of the cost of cellular services. That fact alone has led to projections
that 90 per cent of the population of developed countries would subscribe to
the system.
The second benefit is a very wide usable bandwidth. Unlike cellular phones,
which use much of their available bandwidth to provide the fast cell-to-cell
switching required for communication from moving vehicles, PHS has
sufficient bandwidth for multimedia use. According to Sachio Semmoto,
co-founder of the DDI telecommunications company and a pioneer of PHS, the
personal handy phone opens the door for small operators to compete with
telephone and cable television companies that have wired infrastructures in
place.
This month, a Tokyo cable operator will launch the first tests of PHS for
wireless multimedia applications. Fifteen ground stations will be built for
the test, connected to the Tokyu Cable Television network and then tied to
the switchers of the Tokyo Telecommunication Network. Other Tokyo-based
companies involved in the project include Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Tokyo Electric
Power and Tokyu.
The ability of PHS to transmit multimedia data is especially important to
many areas in China and south-east Asia that lack a copper
telecommunications infrastructure, let alone the 'fibre to the home' that
technologically advanced nations are talking about. PHS offers the potential
of moving into the multimedia age using wireless technology.
But there have been some false starts. Hong Kong had an earlier,
unsatisfactory experience with the Telepoint system and its CT2 technology.
The Hong Kong telecommunications authority chose PHS over DECT and the
American B-CDMA systems. The decision was largely based on the results of
Japanese field trials that have been under way in Sapporo and Tokyo since
last autumn.
The Tokyo trials will finish at the end of September, but in Sapporo 98.7
per cent of male non-business users said they wanted to use a handy phone as
soon as commercial service begins. Female non-business users were only
slightly less enthusiastic at 97.5 per cent.
Hong Kong decided on PHS after the Japanese system was promoted by Japan's
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) and a consortium of 28
companies including Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, DDI, Kokusai Denshin
Denwa, NEC, Nippon Motorola and Sweden's Ericsson.
Hong Kong, which has already asked MPT for technical assistance in
introducing the system, will be able to accommodate approximately 6m
subscribers within its confined geographical area by allocating the same
1,895-1,918.1 MHz band that Japan will use for its system. Other technical
issues such as voice transmission speed and switch specifications have yet
to be decided.
Licences will be awarded to telecommunications carriers in the first quarter
of 1995 and the Hong Kong service is expected to begin by late summer or
early autumn. MPT hopes that Hong Kong will be the first of many Asian
governments to adopt PHS.
At the end of August, the ministry set up a task force to promote the
acceptance of a single wireless communications standard throughout Asia.
Called the Office of Multimedia Mobile Communications Promotion, the task
force will begin by establishing a multimedia mobile communications study
group to evaluate the feasibility of establishing PHS as that standard.
The ministry's goal is to promote the development of a multimedia
information infrastructure for Asia. Wireless technology is essential
because most Asian countries are not expected to create a 'hard-wired'
infrastructure until well into the next century at the earliest.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Technology: Coffee and genes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the non-squashy tomato and the slow-ripening banana, the latest
product to catch the imagination of genetic engineers is the decaffeinated
coffee bean.
This month, ESCAgenetics Corporation, a Californian biotechnology company
based in San Carlos, was granted a patent covering a process for genetically
modifying coffee cells. The company is now looking for a collaborator to
help exploit the process.
That process involves inserting a gene from a wild strain of coffee that
produces low levels of caffeine into coffee cells grown in culture. The same
process could be used to produce coffee plants with better yields and
increased pest resistance.
The developers hope the use of genetic engineering will be a breakthrough in
the hitherto largely frustrating quest to produce naturally decaffeinated
coffee. Attempts to breed decaffeinated coffee plants are complicated
because coffee cells have four sets of chromosomes, making them difficult to
manipulate.
The success of ESCAgenetics's process in producing decaffeinated coffee
plants is so far unproven, and putting the process to the test will be
lengthy. It will take a year from the initial gene-splicing experiment to
produce the first seedlings, after which it will take three to five years to
produce the first crop.
The company believes that decaffeinated coffee produced by its process is
likely to be cheaper than existing methods of decaffeinating coffee. It also
hopes that consumers would prefer its process because of concern about
chemical solvents which are sometimes used to remove caffeine from ordinary
coffee.
If the process proves successful, it could potentially open up a large
market. Decaffeinated coffee accounts for around a third of the coffee
market in health-conscious countries such as the US.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Technology: Dangers of data overload - Information is an
asset that must be guarded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With a computer on every desk, information now flows freely in most
commercial organisations. But according to Robert Hawley, chairman of
Nuclear Electric, the state-owned UK nuclear power generator, that very
access to data is proving counter-productive.
Companies are being saturated with data. Hawley is one of a growing band of
industrialists who have recognised the need to control information before it
can be properly exploited.
Since last October, Hawley has chaired meetings of the Hawley Committee.
Taking its cue from the Cadbury Report on corporate governance, this body is
dedicated to producing practical guidelines for board members when dealing
with information systems.
Hawley's fellow committee members include leading figures from Smiths
Industries, the aerospace and defence group, the Cooperative Bank, the
Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Defence. This working party is
complemented by KPMG, the management consultancy. It has been assigned the
vital leg-work of trawling through British industry to establish data on the
management of information. The main finding of the committee so far is that
the saturation of information in business is undermining its value. Staff at
all levels are overwhelmed with computerised data.
'In our attempts to make sure everybody is informed we're over-informing,'
says Hawley.
One way to tackle this problem is to limit access to IT systems. This might
appear to fly in the face of the received wisdom of the 1980s that more
databases meant better business. Hawley thinks otherwise, and has embarked
on an ambitious programme to rationalise information in his own backyard.
A Nuclear Electric working group is trying to establish just who needs what
information. It is currently preparing for privatisation, so any move that
trims an annual IT budget of Pounds 35m and also ties into management
concerns about unlimited access to information is timely.
The executive information system blinking from the terminal on Hawley's desk
is updated with market data, the organisation's daily operations and the
state of play at 15 nuclear power plants. But it can only be used by 100
staff.
'When I came on board, everybody wanted it. The popular sentiment was to
expand the system by 100 staff at a time. But we run the business with this
information. It's one hell of an asset and now we're protecting it.'
According to Hawley, not enough executives view information as a vital and
risky asset, even though 'the board is ultimately responsible for illegal
use of data'. A deluge of publicity surrounded the recent British Airways'
courtroom admission that staff effected illegal access to Virgin Airlines'
booking data. But this case does not appear to have raised the profile of
information as a critical asset to be guarded.
Hawley is keenly aware that a report of the committee's findings will only
be as good as the response it generates. Will industry take the conclusions
on board? Hawley hopes it will and intends to distil the committee's
conclusions into a painless read.
'We're not going to produce a tome. There will be a single page containing
short and simple guidelines. That should spark enough interest to get board
members reading a more detailed document listing our findings.'
Hawley is convinced that this is too important an issue to gather dust.
'We're not studying the mismanagement of IT,' says Hawley. 'We are saying
that information is an asset main board directors are consistently failing
to recognise.'
He says boards are not yet asking whether they are getting the right
information. 'They can easily talk about the bicycle shed question - which
big computer system to install. But they miss the whole issue of management
of information.'

FT  01 SEP 94 / Accountancy: Little has changed in a quarter of a century -
The first edition of Accountancy Age sees a continuity of issues over 25
years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Twenty five years ago, Neil Armstrong took his first steps on the moon,
Concorde made its inaugural flight, parliament abolished the death penalty
and the London School of Economics was closed by student protests.
Predictably enough, things were rather more static in the conservative world
of British accountancy. But not everything stood still. On Friday December
5, 1969, a new weekly specialist journal came into existence which continues
to thrive: Accountancy Age.
The senior editor was Robert Willott, now in charge of Willott Kingston
Smith, a specialist London-based accountancy firm. The advertisement manager
was Maurice Saatchi, who later decided to go it alone. The publisher was
Michael Heseltine's Haymarket group.
Some 62,750 copies were distributed free to all qualified accountants,
including members of the Institute of Cost and Works Accountants (now
Chartered Institute of Management Accountants) and the Association of
Certified and Corporate Accountants (now the Chartered Association of
Certified Accountants). Others could pay two shillings for the privilege of
hearing an independent voice for the profession.
Flicking through the 32 pages of the first issue, the format looks strangely
familiar to readers of the Age today. There are differences, of course. In
common with many newspapers at the time, there were no by-lines on the
stories to indicate who had written them.
One article makes references to the tight restrictions imposed by the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales: advertising or
soliciting for new business by accountancy firms is prohibited. Members
could give their names and call themselves 'chartered accountants' if quoted
on television or in print, but they were forbidden from mentioning the name
of their firms.
Salaries also reflected the era. The advertisement section tantalises with
some jobs paying as much as Pounds 5,000, and remuneration for an equity
partner designate in an accountancy firm of Pounds 3,000.
There is a piece about the Canola 1200 electronic desk calculator, 'probably
the cheapest of its kind available in this country' at Pounds 325, which is
able to multiply and divide numbers. Its dimensions were 10.5 inches by 13
inches.
On the same page, the Decimal Training Company is selling plastic replicas
for training purposes of Britain's new decimal coins, scheduled to be
introduced in February 1971. 'Experience has shown that even when
checking-out cashiers have been trained it is realistic to expect that
checking out will take longer,' it warns.
One of the most happy and visible changes since that early era is the
disappearance of an enormous number of sexist advertisements, with
skimpily-clad women draped around the most mundane products on the slightest
pretext.
Even the editorial judgments were affected. Page two of the first issue
includes a large photograph of Gail Renshaw, Miss USA, and runner up in the
Miss World contest. The justification for her appearance was that she was
studying for her CPA qualification with a firm in Lexington, Georgia.
But perhaps the biggest surprise to a contemporary reader of the original
edition of Accountancy Age is how little the issues of the day have changed
in the last quarter of a century.
The most prominent front page story deals with 'staff shortages and
legislative complications' at the Inland Revenue threatening a 'tax crisis'.
The board of the Revenue had called for a three-year standstill on all new
tax legislation, while the accountancy profession was demanding in its
'annual plea' simplification and removal of anomalies and 'hastily
conceived' proposals.
Mr N C Price, deputy chairman of the board, complains that 'we do say in the
most forcible terms that we do not want anything new until we have had time
to digest what we were given in 1965.' Meanwhile, the Confederation of
British Industry was criticising tax changes 'for not having been thought
out sufficiently well in advance'.
The Revenue also seemed concerned that youth clearly had its mind more on
Bob Dylan and drugs than on matters fiscal, since it bemoaned the
difficulties in retaining staff and the need to remove both the 'material
and psychological barriers' to the recruitment of graduates.
The tension of the 'dual role' of accountants also featured prominently: an
article highlighted the claimed conflict of interest when auditors also act
as consultants, accountable in the first role to shareholders and in the
latter role to the board.
One anonymous consultant complained to the Age that the role of the
accountant as the statutory auditor should be made more 'constructive', and
that management information services provided by the firms should be
restricted to these areas.
The story was triggered by apparent concerns from management consultants
under threat because the Institute had lifted its ban on marketing for the
consulting arms of the firms - a move welcomed in one of the Age's first
editorials.
A second editorial supports calls from Lord Shawcross, then chairman of the
City Takeover Panel, for the accountancy profession to clarify current
practices. He was concerned about the inconsistencies in financial
reporting, and the fact that the existing limited guidelines issued were not
mandatory.
Ironically, the first profile of a 'leading figure' was Sir Joseph Latham,
who had quit AEI after its takeover by GEC at the end of a hotly contested
battle. Disputes about the profit forecasts made by AEI  - to which
Shawcross was in part referring - became the starting point for the creation
of the Accounting Standards Committee, forerunner of the Accounting
Standards Board.
'I could sit down with auditors in most big companies, produce two widely
different forecasts and convince the auditors of the validity of each,' Sir
Joseph says. He makes a plea for accountants to present 'reality' not the
figures as shown in 'an orthodox accounting statement'.
Mr Ronald Leach, yet to be knighted in 1969 but that year's president of the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and senior partner
of Peat Marwick Mitchell, was also quoted in an extensive interview with the
magazine.
His most important concern? The ill-fated attempt to integrate the different
professional accountancy bodies. His view was that modernisation and
consolidation was essential, and the chance to merge the bodies might never
be possible again.
He talked about the possibility and complexities of the incorporation of
accountancy firms, partly reflecting their desire to try to raise external
capital to help fund their operations and also to protect them from
unlimited liability at a time of rising legal claims and escalating
insurance costs.
He discussed rotation of audit firms - on which he was open-minded - and the
tensions of auditors getting too close to management - which he argued did
not in his experience jeopardise independence.
Leach suggested there was likely to be greater consolidation of the firms, a
shift of clients towards large firms and a single worldwide auditor, and
predicted a move towards accountancy becoming a graduate profession.
Some of his predictions have clearly held true. Yet overall, the message of
the Age seems to be that little of substance has changed at all in its first
25 years. When it celebrates its 50th anniversary, much of the profession
might take some secret comfort from that.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Teacher unions warn on ill-health
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Figures showing a 19 per cent increase in the number of teachers retiring on
grounds of ill health over the past two years today led unions to claim that
schools faced a teacher shortage.
Statistics for England and Wales from the Teachers Pensions Agency,
published by the National Association of Head Teachers, also showed a 350
per cent increase in the number of heads and deputy heads being made
redundant since the 1990-91 academic year.
They include a 10-fold increase in redundancies for deputy heads, from 29 to
316 over the four-year period.
Mr David Hart, the association's general secretary, said: 'The considerable
increase in ill-health retirements for teachers should serve as a warning
about stress levels throughout the profession.'
He added that deputy heads were often needed to take on the extra
administrative tasks created by recent government reforms, but that in many
large secondary schools heads were working with one or two, rather than
three or four deputies.
He said: 'There could be good reasons for reorganising the hierarchy of a
school. But it is often being done instead for budgetary reasons, adding
nothing to efficient management and putting more pressure on the head.'
There was also concern over Department for Education statistics showing that
the numbers passing the Postgraduate Certificate of Education teacher
training qualification last year rose by only 1 per cent, with a drop of 4
per cent in the number of men qualifying.
Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said
the high numbers leaving the profession meant a 1 per cent rise was 'not
enough to cope with the expected increase in primary school pupil numbers'.

FT  01 SEP 94 / BA silent over 'harassment' saga
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A retired police officer who has alleged he was harassed after making
complaints to British Airways was told the airline did not challenge his
account of the incidents, although it denied responsibility for them.
Mr John Gorman, a retired police officer, has alleged that he was the victim
of a series of threatening phone calls, robbery of documents and a beating
in his home since he complained of a condom in an in-flight meal in January
1990.
It is understood that in a meeting in July between Mr Mervyn Walker, BA's
senior lawyer, and Mr Gorman, Mr Walker accepted that criminal incidents had
occured. But BA said it had not 'been able to find out who is responsible
for what has happened'.
Mr Gorman said the abuse escalated after he reported a piece of glass found
in his drink during an in-flight meal in January 1993. In May 1993 he was
arrested for alleged conspiracy to defraud BA but it was decided there was
insufficient evidence to prosecute.
At least one of the allegedly malicious phone calls made in November 1993
has been traced to the offices of Mr Ian Jackson, then BA head of security.
But BA said Mr Jackson was away from his office on the day of the call.
It is also believed that some malicious phone calls made to Mr Gorman's home
have been traced to the Heathrow police station or to public telephone
booths within the station. The Metropolitan Police are continuing inquiries.
Last week BA passed on documents concerning its own investigations.
The police complaints unit has also prepared a report for the Crown
Prosecution Service.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Lib Dems set out plans on low pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A regional minimum wage and the introduction of a low-pay commission were
yesterday proposed by the Liberal Democrats as options to bridge the gulf
between the low paid and high wage earners.
The package of proposals outlined in a discussion paper, Working for Change,
will be put to the party's conference in Brighton next month. The two
options are:
Establishing a regional minimum hourly rate of pay across the whole economy;
A low-pay commission to investigate any industrial sector or company in
which it believed there was exploitation due to low pay. The commission
would recommend solutions such as a minimum hourly rate in a particular
sector or company.
The party is also proposing converting social security benefits to the
long-term unemployed into vouchers payable to employers taking them on.

FT  01 SEP 94 / North Sea gas licences granted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday announced the completion of the 15th North Sea oil
and gas licensing round, the first to be conducted under a 'fast-track'
approach to ensure early exploration of the blocks on offer.
Mr Tim Eggar, energy and industry minister, said many of the successful
bidders had agreed to accelerate their seismic surveys and exploration
drilling to ensure any discoveries could be tied into the existing North Sea
transportation infrastructure.
'This will bring forward smaller developments which might not otherwise be
economic,' he said.
The six-year licences cover 29 of the 81 blocks offered last April. They are
concentrated in the southern basin, a mainly gas area, and the central North
Sea. Both are established production areas.
Amoco UK, the British arm of the US oil company, and British Gas were among
the successful bidders. But Mr Eggar said he was pleased that a number of
smaller companies also secured licences.
The recent surge in North Sea oil and gas production continued in July,
according to figures published yesterday by the Royal Bank of Scotland.
Output to the end of July was up 29 per cent over the same period last year,
in spite of a seasonal fall owing to annual maintenance shutdowns on many
platforms. Oil production in July averaged 2.4m barrels a day, 19 per cent
higher than a year ago.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Doctors fear 'death blow' of local pay deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prospects for a better relationship between the government and doctors would
be dealt an 'ideological death blow' if ministers went ahead with plans for
local performance-related pay, the British Medical Association warned
yesterday.
Dr Sandy Macara, chairman of the association's council, told a BMA national
conference in London that he believed Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health
secretary, had responded positively to BMA calls for changes to the 1991
reforms to the NHS. The 'fragile but precious prospect' this offered of
finding a 'new consensus to restore equity, integrity and sanity' to
healthcare could be wrecked if the government tried to force local pay
machinery on the NHS.
Ministers intend to start shifting the NHS's national pay structure to local
arrangements next year. Hospital managers have been told to have local pay
machinery in place by February.
Conference delegates brought the BMA into direct conflict with these plans,
with hundreds of doctors from throughout the country declaring that locally
determined pay was 'not compatible with a national health service'.
The BMA fears that, in the market-based NHS created by the 1991 reforms,
local pay arrangements would force doctors to concentrate on their
hospitals' business priorities at the expense of medical ones. Because some
hospitals and medical specialties are more financially viable than others,
it believes local pay would undermine the even spread of specialist skills
throughout the country.
Dr Anthony Toft, president of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh,
told the conference there was a 'certain inevitability' that managers would
offer the greatest rewards to individuals, units or hospitals generating the
greatest incomes.
The conference demonstrated the extent to which the doctors' vocal
opposition to local pay is seen as spearheading wider concerns in the NHS
and elsewhere in the public sector. Although the BMA is not affiliated to
the Trades Union Congress, Mr John Monks, general secretary, sent a message
of support to the conference.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Britannia cabin crews back strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cabin crews at Britannia Airways, the UK's second-largest airline, have
voted to take strike action in support of their annual pay claim.
About 700 out of the 900 Britannia members of the British Airlines Stewards
and Stewardesses Association - part of the Transport and General Workers
Union - voted. Some 87 per cent of these supported the strike, the union
said.
The union had rejected an offer of 3 per cent on basic pay, with an extra 2
per cent unconsolidated lump-sum payment.
Britannia management has agreed to talks with the union today together with
Acas, the conciliation service.
In the meantime Britannia, in volume terms the biggest charter airline in
the world and a subsidiary of Thomson Travel Group, the holiday company, is
training volunteers from other parts of the group.
The airline said it had secured more than the 400 volunteers it needed to
replace striking cabin staff if they took action. Some 900 of the airline's
1,460 cabin crew belong to the union. The 400 volunteers are undergoing a
four-day safety and emergency procedures course that will allow them to gain
Civil Aviation Authority certification.
Britannia said it was confident that it would be able to run a complete
service with skeleton crews.
The union said it would be taking selective strike action, probably over
weekends, if negotiations broke down.
It is seeking extra commission rates on duty-free sales on board aircraft.
The company has rejected this, which it said would give staff a pay rise
equivalent to between 11 per cent and 15 per cent.
Mr Matthew Campbell, the union's airport officer, said staff did not think
the pay offer adequately reflected changes to their rosters and working
conditions. He cast doubt on the airline's ability to train replacement
staff adequately in safety standards and called the proposed use of skeleton
crews 'dangerous and unwise'.
He said: 'I would not want to be flying with them with people being trained
for four days.'
Mr Roger Burnell, Britannia managing director, said: 'In the event of
industrial action we believe the measures we have taken will enable us to
maintain safe operations, albeit with reduced standards of catering and
on-board services.'

FT  01 SEP 94 / Stena joins curb on live animals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stena Sealink became the last big ferry company to impose a ban on the
transport of live animals on its cross-channel routes yesterday. The ban,
which comes into effect today, applies to animals which are exported for
fattening and subsequent slaughter in continental abattoirs.
Sealink's decision followed earlier moves by P&amp;O and Brittany Ferries to
stop carrying live animals destined for slaughter after a high-profile
campaign orchestrated by animal welfare groups such as the Royal Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
The Ministry of Agriculture is trying to work out an acceptable code of
practice with the ferry companies, livestock exporters and welfare groups.
Stena said that until a code of practice is adopted its ban will remain in
place.
But Mr Roger Gale, the Conservative MP and chairman of the Commons all-party
animal-welfare group, called yesterday for a end to the transport of live
animals throughout the European Union and from its member states.
Mr Gale said: 'It is abundantly plain that mainland European authorities are
quite simply not interested in enforcing transport regulations.'
Welfare groups are pushing for an improvement in conditions for animals in
transit, including a reduction in the 24-hour time limit during which they
can travel without food or water.
However, EU governments have found difficulty in agreeing changes to
existing regulations.
Sealink carries about 10 per cent of the live animals exported, compared
with 60 per cent for P&amp;O and 10 per cent for Brittany Ferries.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Lib Dem paper tackles low pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A regional minimum wage and the introduction of a low pay commission were
yesterday proposed by the Liberal Democrats as options to bridge the gulf
between the low paid and high wage earners.
The package of proposals, outlined in a discussion paper, Working for
Change, will be put to the party's conference in Brighton next month. The
two options are:
Establishing a regional minimum hourly rate of pay across the whole economy.
A low pay commission to investigate any industrial sector or company in
which it believed there was exploitation due to low pay. The commission
would recommend solutions such as a minimum hourly rate in a particular
sector or company.
Baroness Williams, the former MP Shirley Williams, who chaired the policy
working group, said: 'There are good reasons, if you are giving people
exactly the same standard of living, for some variations (in pay) between
one region and another.'
Mr Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, described Labour's
support for a national minimum wage as 'ill-defined and inflexible'. The
party is concerned that a minimum wage can destroy jobs if set too high.
The party is also proposing converting social security benefits to the
long-term unemployed into vouchers payable to employers taking them on.
The party has estimated that the cost to the state would be 'negligible',
and less than the cost of benefit and tax revenue forgone for the unemployed
 -an average of Pounds 173 a week.
Its document also suggests tax relief measures on the costs of child care.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Graduate employment surges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 50,000 new graduates of English higher-education institutions had
found permanent employment by the end of last year, the highest figure on
record, the Department for Education said yesterday.
The figures follow several other surveys which suggest that graduate
unemployment has peaked, and that the labour market is now absorbing the
extra number of graduates being produced by England's expanded
higher-education system.
The number of graduates finding a permanent job rose 19 per cent to 51,500,
having fallen for three successive years since the previous peak in 1989 of
48,300.
Women's success in the graduate labour market improved sharply. For the
first time on record, more female graduates (26,500) found jobs than men
(25,000). While 41 per cent of female graduates found a permanent job, only
36.9 per cent of male graduates did so.
Graduate unemployment stabilised at 13,600, having trebled over the previous
three years. Men were far more likely to be without a job six months after
graduating, suffering an un-employment rate of 12.25 per cent compared with
8.2 per cent for women.
This was achieved in spite of a 120 per cent increase in the number of women
graduating since 1983. They accounted for 49.5 per cent of all graduates, up
from 43 per cent 10 years earlier.
Numbers entering teacher training rose 5 per cent, while entries to other
further-education and training courses rose 4 per cent following several
years of swift increases.
Of those gaining a first degree, 49 per cent obtained a first or upper
second class honours award compared with 45 per cent in 1989.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, pointed out that Britain had
the highest graduation rate in the EU, and added: 'The quality controls we
have set in place for higher education ensure that the standards of degrees
are maintained.'
The proportion graduating in science rose to 36 per cent compared with 34
per cent in 1989. The proportion of women graduates in science has risen
from 21 per cent in 1989 to 24 per cent in 1993.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Adviser's fine and costs total Pounds 73,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Disciplinary charges relating to investment advertisements, maintaining
proper records, and supervising staff have cost Knight Williams, one of the
UK's largest financial advisers, more than Pounds 73,000.
Fimbra, the self-regulating organisation for independent financial advisers,
yesterday announced a Pounds 50,000 fine - the second-largest it has levied
 -and associated costs against KW. The penalty will be financed by a
reduction in the dividend to shareholders.
The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator, took the
unusual step of issuing a statement. SIB said it had received an assurance
from KW that full consideration would be given to any complaint made by a
client, including complaints which had already been dealt with but where the
customer wanted to reopen the issue.
Two of the 10 charges related to investment advertisements, but most covered
failings in client files.
Fimbra said that there was not enough information on files to show that
dealings with customers complied with regulatory rules about giving best
advice, properly knowing the customer's needs and making suitable
recommendations.
KW yesterday issued a written statement saying it believed no clients had
been financially disadvantaged, and that it was implementing procedures
designed to ensure that the rule breaches did not recur. It refused to
answer questions about the Fimbra fine or its statement.

<TEXT>
Railtrack claimed last night that 53.4 per cent of its network was open
yesterday in defiance of the signal workers' strike which will end at noon
today, Robert Taylor writes. The RMT transport union intends to hold the
next strike a week today for 24 hours.
Only 17 per cent of signal workers worked normally yesterday with little
sign of any erosion of support for the dispute among union members.
The union said some who returned to work during last week's strike stayed
away yesterday because of their outrage at the 4.7 per cent pay rise awarded
to MPs.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Exchange rules out Anglia action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Stock Exchange said yesterday that it would take no action against
Anglia Television's directors after reviewing the Department of Trade and
Industry's report on alleged insider dealing in the company's shares.
The exchange had been examining whether Lady Archer, an Anglia director, had
taken sufficient steps under its Yellow Book rules to prevent the leakage of
price-sensitive information and to ensure that her husband, Lord Archer, did
not deal in Anglia shares before MAI's Pounds 292m takeover of the
television company.
DTI inspectors had been told that on January 12, Lady Archer attended an
Anglia board meeting, at which the price proposed by MAI for the Anglia
takeover was first discussed.
On the following day, Lord Archer placed an order to buy 25,000 Anglia
shares on behalf of an acquaintance, Mr Broosk Saib. A further 25,000 shares
were bought for Mr Saib on January 14. On January 18, when the takeover bid
was publicly announced, Lord Archer ordered the sale of the shares, netting
a profit for Mr Saib of just over Pounds 77,000.
Anglia said last night that the exchange's finding confirmed its own
investigations.
The DTI said in July that it would be taking no further action against Lord
Archer, the bestselling novelist and former deputy chairman of the
Conservative party. It plans to issue a reply in the next few days to a
question from Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade secretary, about whether there
is any legal impediment to the publication of the report if Lord Archer
gives his consent.

and power station in Runcorn, Cheshire, Michael Smith writes.
The plant, which will supply electricity and steam for Salt Union, part of
the Harris Chemicals Group, will be owned and operated by Hydro.
Surplus electricity will be sold to Hydro's existing customers through the
local distribution system.
Salt Union is Hydro's third combined plant in England. The first was a 9MW
joint venture with Arjo Wiggins in Dover, Kent, and the second is a 157MW
joint venture with BNFL at Sellafield in Cumbria.

FT  01 SEP 94 / More appeals likely against tax decisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A steep increase in the number of appeals against tax decisions is expected
to follow reforms to the appeal procedures to be phased in over the next
four months.
The reforms will make it easier to challenge rulings by Customs &amp; Excise and
open the procedure for appealing against the Inland Revenue to public
scrutiny.
The VAT and Duties Tribunal will for the first time hear appeals against
Customs &amp; Excise duty assessments from January 1. These assessments now can
be challenged only in the High Court, with appeals taking two years to be
heard.
At the same time, the special commissioners who hear appeals by taxpayers
over Inland Revenue decisions are opening their proceedings to the public
from today after nearly 200 years of secrecy.
Tax appeals to the special commissioners lodged from today will be heard in
public unless the taxpayer wants it to be in private. The commissioners'
decisions will also now be published, providing information to taxpayers and
their advisers that was previously available only to tax inspectors.
Judge Stephen Oliver, who presides over both bodies, said yesterday he
expected the reforms to encourage a higher level of appeals against tax
decisions.
He predicted that appeals against Revenue decisions would rise by 10 per
cent to 15 per cent as taxpayers and their advisers saw commissioners'
decisions. 'Openness will stimulate accountants, lawyers and advisers to
appeal against decisions which they had previously thought were beyond
challenge,' he said.
On Customs &amp; Excise duties, the judge estimated that the tribunal might
attract 160 to 200 appeals a year compared with the four or five cases which
come to the High Court under the present arrangements.
The tribunal will be able to review a wide range of administrative decisions
by Customs &amp; Excise relating to duties. These include licensing arrangements
for bonded warehouses, the imposition of anti-dumping duties and deadlines
for payment of duties.
The tribunal will also hear appeals over two new taxes introduced in the
November Budget last year: the insurance premium tax from October 1, and the
air passenger duty from November 1.
Judge Oliver said he planned to recruit new members to reflect the expansion
of the tribunal's remit. Representative bodies affected by Customs &amp; Excise
duties, insurance premium tax and air passenger duty would be invited to put
names forward.
He also intended to create a users' committee to advise him on the work of
the special commissioners. This would review their rules and procedures and
make recommendations about facilities for those appearing before the
commissioners.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Terms set out for tenders on Channel link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The four private consortia bidding to build the Channel Tunnel rail link
must submit plans to build stations at both Ebbsfleet in Kent and Stratford
in east London, Dr Brian Mawhinney, the transport secretary, announced
yesterday.
Ebbsfleet will definitely be the site for an international and domestic
station, while a decision will be taken later on Stratford. Tenderers have
been asked to submit plans for both an international and a domestic station
there.
Proposals to build a station at Rainham in Essex have now been abandoned.
A government decision on intermediate stations for the link was originally
scheduled for May.
The consortia must lodge their tenders with the government by March 14 next
year. These must include the size and timing of the support required from
the government - total costs of the project are estimated at Pounds 2.7bn -
and an allocation of risk between the government and the private sector. Dr
Mawhinney said a bill authorising construction of the link would be ready in
November.
The winning consortium will design, build, finance and operate the link
through European Passenger Services, the company responsible for
international passenger train services using the Channel tunnel, and take
over Union Railways, the British Rail company which has developed the link
project.
The four groups invited to tender are: Eurorail CTRL (BICC, GEC, HSBC
Holdings, National Westminster Bank, Seeboard, Trafalgar House); a
consortium of Hochtief, Costain, Nishimatsu and Siemens; London and
Continental (Arup, Bechtel, Blue Circle, Halcrow, National Express, Virgin,
Warburg); and Union Link (AEG, WS Atkins, Holzmann, Mowlem, Spie
Batignolles, Taylor Woodrow).

FT  01 SEP 94 / Employers collude in benefits frauds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employers have been colluding with workers to claim unemployment benefits
fraudulently, according to government inspectors who last year made net
savings of Pounds 53m after stopping benefit frauds.
The Employment Service, part of the employment department, has targeted
employers as part of a clampdown on 'dole cheats'.
Mr James Paice, employment minister, said: 'The majority of benefit
claimants are genuine and their needs will be met by the taxpayer. But
today's figures clearly demonstrate that there are still people who are
working and claiming benefits illegally.
'There are others who help their workforce to commit dole fraud, some even
to the extent that they give employees time to sign on.'
The fraud teams' investigations led to more than 69,500 withdrawals of or
reductions in benefit payments. More than 3,600 claimants were prosecuted,
as were 100 employers for colluding in the fraud.
Those implicated included more than 400 flower-pickers in Cornwall, saving
Pounds 370,000; and more than 500 people working in leisure industries at
coastal resorts in Wales, saving Pounds 562,000.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Value of farmland rises by 21%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The average value of agricultural land rose 21 per cent in the year to the
end of June, according to a farmland valuation index compiled by Savills,
the land surveyors. The improvement in British farm incomes following the
devaluation of sterling against other European currencies has contributed to
the land boom, the company said.
Land values increased most in regions where large arable holdings are
predominant as these farmers have benefited most from the upturn. Rises in
hill land value were lowest at 10 per cent.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Purchasing managers warn on effect of supply bottlenecks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The manufacturing sector continued to expand last month, but the rapid
growth may be creating supply bottlenecks and pushing up prices in some
sectors, a business survey suggested yesterday.
The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply's survey of purchasing
managers showed the price index rose to a seasonally adjusted 73.7 per cent
last month, up from 73.2 per cent in July.
The institute said this was the highest level since the index started in
1991, indicating that more manufacturers were reporting price increases.
Purchasing managers in the plastics, paper and steel sectors had seen
significant price rises, with more than two-thirds of respondents in the
chemical, rubber and plastics industries reporting increased costs, it said.
Although rising commodity prices accounted for part of this surge, growing
demand was also pushing up prices.
In another trend that may point to capacity constraints in some sectors,
suppliers' delivery times were also growing. The suppliers' deliveries time
index fell to 36.6 per cent last month, the lowest rate in its three-year
history.
Meanwhile, the overall index, compiled from the separate figures on output,
orders, purchases, delivery times, stocks and employment, fell to 59.6 per
cent in August compared with 62.0 per cent in July. Any reading above 50 per
cent indicates an increase in activity compared to the previous month so
manufacturing activity was continuing to expand last month in spite of the
slight slowing, the institute said.
Mr Peter Thomson, the institute's director-general, said: 'This strong
recovery presents a great opportunity for UK manufacturers. However, they
urgently need to increase capacity and shorten delivery times to customers
if they are to take full advantage of the growing demand.'
Concerns about the price increases were yesterday echoed by City analysts,
who warned that it might add to pressure on the chancellor to raise base
rates.
Mr Robert Barrie of brokers BZW said: 'The message from this survey, and
recent surveys from the Confederation of British Industry, is that capacity
pressures in manufacturing are growing.'

FT  01 SEP 94 / Swans offer hinges on lay-offs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A fresh proposal from the French company wishing to buy Swan Hunter would
mean some workers having to wait on lay-off, being able only to claim state
benefits when not receiving wages. Any who chose to leave while waiting
would not be entitled to redundancy.
Those being laid off rather than made redundant would forfeit entitlement to
lay-off payments as a condition of continued employment, the Tyneside
shipbuilder in receivership said yesterday.
The affected workers are entitled under the present company scheme to 68 per
cent of their earnings if laid off.
Mr Fred Henderson, who has led negotiations for Soffia/ Constructions
Mecaniques de Normandie on its proposed purchase of Swan Hunter said CMN
would take on the legal obligation to pay the employees their redundancy
should they later not be needed.
The time they would have to wait to resume work at the yard would vary.
Mr Henderson said: 'The way we view it, the entire moral responsibility in
relation to the difficulties which face the workforce rests with the former
employer, not the new employer.'
He said a further CMN condition was that the unions accepted sub-contracting
of shipbuilding work where cheaper. Steelwork, he said, would almost
certainly be sub-contracted, probably to Sunderland.
CMN will buy Swans only if the yard has two years' work. On Tuesday it
offered Price Waterhouse, the receivers, a new deal after a previous
proposal ran into negotiating difficulties.
The new offer includes paying the wages of Swans' design team until the end
of the year in the hope of winning a Ministry of Defence order for an
ocean-survey vessel.
On Tuesday CMN told the receivers it expected them to make everybody
redundant except the design team. But yesterday it amended the proposal,
saying it required the ocean-survey vessel core team to be laid off.
Mr Henderson said that the new offer also required CMN to have 'first
refusal' on Swans' assets, including intellectual property, should it not
buy the yard.
Unions at the yard maintain that CMN must buy the business before
negotiations on terms and conditions.
Mr Henderson and Price Waterhouse are to meet in London today.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Two radio stations to open today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five new large regional commercial radio stations capable of reaching more
than 15m people are being launched over the next fortnight, the first two
going on air today.
The FM stations, aimed at adults, are staging the UK's largest number of
virtually simultaneous radio launches.
The stations should boost commercial radio's 47.4 per cent share of total
listening, put further competitive pressure on the BBC, and encourage growth
in radio's 4 per cent share of total advertising.
The largest of the new stations, JFM 100.4 Northwest, launches today with a
mix of blues, soul, rhythm and blues and jazz. It will be able to be heard
by about 6m people in the north-west.
Mr Peter Salt, managing director of the new station, which is a subsidiary
of Golden Rose Communications, said yesterday he had received more than 800
letters of appreciation from people who had heard test transmissions.
Heart FM, which will launch on September 6, will specialise in soft adult
contemporary music. Up to 3m people in Warwickshire and the west Midlands
will receive the station. Heart, which is owned by Chrysalis, the media
group, has already taken more than Pounds 300,000 in advance advertising
bookings.
Century Radio, a wholly owned subsidiary of Border Television, will be aimed
at the north-east. It also launches today with a mixture of speech, music
and well-known broadcasters such as Simon Bates and James Whale.
Galaxy Radio goes on air on September 4 with a mixture of classic and
contemporary dance music and local and national news to about 2m listeners
in the Severn estuary area in the south-west.
The last of the five to go on air will be Scot Radio on September 16,
broadcasting to central Scotland.
The station, whose main shareholders are Border and Grampian Television,
should be able to reach 70 per cent of the Scottish population with a
mixture of music, and news, phone-ins and conversation during the day.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Union check-off shortfall reported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Between 600,000 and 1.2m of the 6m trade unionists who pay their
subscriptions through the check-off system for deducting dues from wages had
still not signed new instructions to do so by the beginning of last month,
the independent Labour Research Department said yesterday.
Under the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act 1993 union members
who pay through check-off had to confirm their desire to continue paying in
this way by yesterday. The unions will have to repeat this exercise every
three years.
A survey by the department found that very few members had refused to
confirm, but many unions were having difficulty contacting remaining
members.
In the AEEU engineering union, refusals are running at only 0.5 per cent of
the membership but the union is still nearly 20 per cent, or 160,000
members, short of a full sign-up. Just 414 of the 55,416 members of the IRSF
tax officers union had decided not to re-sign.
The public-service union Unison, Britain's largest union, said yesterday
that around 130,000 of its 1.3m members had still to re-sign.
Three unions encouraged their members to switch from check-off to direct
debit payment of their subscriptions. The NUT teaching union persuaded 65
per cent of its members to switch to direct debit, the banking union Bifu
had a 56 per cent conversion and Natfhe, the lecturers' union, had a 47 per
cent conversion.
The survey found that 12 employers had withdrawn check-off facilities
including the Bank of England, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays (from
November) and BAA, the airports group.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Monks expected to address Lib Dems: Break with tradition may
invite criticism at TUC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Monks, the Trades Union Congress general secretary, is expected to
break with tradition and address the Liberal Democrats' conference later
this month.
He will also address a fringe meeting at the Conservative party conference.
Mr Monks is keen to loosen the trade union movement's special ties with the
Labour party in favour of a more broad lobbying role with close ties to the
main parties and the government. He continued to stress this modernisation
strategy yesterday at the launch of a TUC-commissioned book by Robert
Taylor, labour correspondent of the Financial Times.
The TUC general secretary said trade unions should support rights for all
workers - not just union members. 'As champions of workplace rights for all,
unions can help to restore the balance between capital and labour that has
been upset by 15 years of hostile anti-union legislation,' he said.
He added: 'The immediate outlook is difficult but the unions are adaptable
and pragmatic enough to grow.'
His policies have their opponents in the trade union movement and Mr Monks'
decision to address parties other than Labour may attract criticism at next
week's TUC Congress.
He has received an 'open-ended' invitation from the Liberal Democrats to
speak to the full conference or to a fringe meeting. Mr Monks also said
yesterday that he had accepted an invitation from the Law Society to speak
at a fringe meeting at the Conservative conference.
Both Mr Monks and Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, believe that a greater
distance between the trade unions and the Labour party would be to their
mutual advantage.
However some union officials have raised objections to the close relations
Mr Monks has been trying to foster with government ministers.
The three main TUC-affiliated unions - Unison, the public-service union and
the TGWU and the GMB , the two general unions - all objected to an
invitation to Mr David Hunt, then employment secretary, to attend a
TUC-organised conference on full employment in July.
The arrival of Mr Michael Portillo to replace Mr Hunt makes a close
relationship between the TUC leader and the employment secretary less
likely, although Mr Monks has had an introductory meeting with Mr Portillo.

<TEXT>
Harmonisation of employment laws in the European Union must 'remain within
reasonable limits', Mr Jacques Delors said in London yesterday, David
Goodhart writes.
Mr Delors, retiring president of the European Commission, said at a Trades
Union Congress meeting that EU-level rights must not become an obstacle for
less developed countries.
Mr Delors, a former union leader in France, stressed that it was important
to respect national diversity. He also warned that unions had often failed
to stay in touch with their members' aspirations and needed to restrain wage
demands.

FT  01 SEP 94 / The IRA Ceasefire: Cautious response urged on Major - UK
reaction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prime minister was yesterday urged by rightwing Conservatives not to
embark on constitutional talks with Sinn Fein until the IRA agreed to a
permanent ceasefire.
Among Northern Ireland politicians, nationalists greeted the ceasefire
announcement with delight while unionists voiced suspicion that the
statement did not signal a permanent end to the IRA's terrorist campaign.
Sir George Gardiner, chairman of the 92 group of Thatcherite Tory MPs,
warned of the risk of 'igniting opinion in the majority of Northern Ireland'
if ministers moved too fast in response to the IRA ceasefire.
Mr Andrew Hunter, a member of the Commons Northern Ireland committee, feared
it could be 'a tactical ploy - a pause in the killing'.
He said: 'You cannot possibly sit at a table and negotiate with people who
will resume killing if they don't get what they want in those negotiations -
that is an impossible situation.'
An indication of the potential Tory opposition to constitutional talks with
Sinn Fein came with the publication of a pamphlet by Mr Norman Lamont, the
former chancellor, who argued against involving Sinn Fein in talks.
The pamphlet, written before yesterday's announcement, said Sinn Fein's
participation in a constitutional conference would put ministers 'in the
position of being held responsible for the next round of terror if they do
not give in to the IRA blackmail of threatening to pull out'.
On the left of the Tory party Mr Peter Temple-Morris said people were
'afraid of peace'. Another Tory backbencher urged unionists to 'seize the
opportunities of peace' and break the 'hatred of the past'.
Mr Tony Blair, Labour leader, gave a cautious welcome to the IRA ceasefire,
but stressed the test would come in whether it led to a permanent
renunciation of violence.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said: 'If the IRA has at last
realised that it cannot achieve its aims through violence, then this is a
very important moment for peace in Northern Ireland.'
In Northern Ireland, unionist politicians said the IRA should surrender its
arsenal of weapons and explosives to prove it was serious about ending
terrorism for good.
But Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, who put
his reputation on the line by talking with Sinn Fein, said the ceasefire
would be 'welcomed by Irish people everywhere, but particularly by the
people in the streets of Northern Ireland. Now we face the primary challenge
which is to reach agreement among our divided people.'
The Rev William McCrea, an MP from the hardline Democratic Unionist party,
said the IRA was not seeking peace but trying to blackmail the government
for more concessions.
Dr John Alderdice, leader of the moderate Alliance party, commented that
actions would speak louder than words.
Mr Terry Carlin, regional officer of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions,
called on 'all paramilitary organisations to halt the violence. There's a
lot of work to be done in healing the wounds and the mental and physical
scars of social deprivation.'
A number of broadcasters, led by Mr John Birt, the BBC director-general,
last night called on the government to reconsider broadcasting restrictions
on Sinn Fein members in view of the ceasefire.

FT  01 SEP 94 / The IRA Ceasefire: Sweet moments for SDLP leader - John Hume
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The crucial word 'permanent' did not appear in the IRA's ceasefire
statement. But these must nevertheless be sweet moments for Mr John Hume.
The leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party is
widely credited with injecting vital momentum into the peace process through
his meetings with Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, starting in April
1993.
He was pilloried savagely for his troubles - not least when he claimed in
November there could be 'peace within a week' if the joint initiative,
dismissed as 'sheer lunacy' by Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist
leader, was embraced.
But now he is entitled at the very least to a wry smile. His decision to put
his reputation on the line by insisting on the overriding need to bring Sinn
Fein on board, often against the instincts of his senior party colleagues,
may well have been vindicated.
No wonder he yesterday professed himself 'very pleased indeed' with the the
IRA's announcement and insisted that a total cessation of violence was at
hand.
The sheer bitterness of the vitriol that has at times been heaped on him
over the last year is in some ways readily comprehensible.
Apart from his determination to sup with the devil, as hardline unionists
have seen it, Mr Hume has a reputation for not being a good team player, and
for arrogance and bloody-mindedness. Interviews with him can quickly
degenerate into university-style tutorials.
His frustration at the comments of others in some of the heated Commons
debates as the UK-Irish initiative ground its way forward has sometimes been
counter-productive and all too readily apparent.
But Mr Hume, 57, is also a man of passion, generosity and integrity -
besides being enormously good company.
Although steeped in the cauldron of Ulster politics, the stress of the last
few months has been enormous. A cigarette is rarely absent from his grasp.
Talk of his retirement as MP for Foyle, a Westminster seat he has held for
11 years in addition to serving as one of the province's three MEPs, has
surfaced more than once. But it is a safe bet that such thoughts are far
from his mind at present.
Among his most pressing tasks will be to try to convince the British
government that yesterday's announcement is enough to start the clock
ticking on the three-month period within which London has promised to begin
talks with Sinn Fein in the event of a permanent end to violence. He said
yesterday that he hoped dialogue would begin 'as soon as possible'.
A respected figure in Washington and Brussels, he may also have a key role
to play in encouraging support for the substantial package of US aid which
is widely expected.
The transformation that heavy US investment has helped bring about in his
backyard of Derry - once the epicentre of the troubles but comparatively
calm in recent years - is seen by many as indicative of what might be
achieved throughout the province.

FT  01 SEP 94 / The IRA Ceasefire: US visa gives veteran a role in peace
process - Joe Cahill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The final piece of the jigsaw to fall into place before the announcement of
the IRA ceasefire was the granting on Tuesday of a US visa to Mr Joe Cahill,
a veteran republican.
During the visit of an influential Irish-American delegation to Dublin and
Belfast last week, Sinn Fein attached great importance to the US government
allowing a senior republican to visit the country.
The purpose of Mr Cahill's visit is to explain the plans of Sinn Fein and
the IRA to republican supporters and to prepare the ground for Sinn Fein's
efforts to encourage the US administration into acting as an 'honest broker'
in developing the peace process.
Mr Cahill, now in his late 60s, was sentenced to death for IRA activity in
1942. The sentence was commuted, and he emerged in the early 1970s as a key
figure in establishing the Provisional IRA when it split from the Official
IRA.
He became commanding officer of the IRA's 'Belfast Brigade' in 1971. He met
Mr Harold Wilson, the Labour leader then in opposition, during a 72-hour IRA
ceasefire. The two met again later at Mr Wilson's home.
Mr Merlyn Rees, then Labour's spokesman on Northern Ireland, described Mr
Cahill and his colleagues as 'hard men who talked and looked like soldiers.
'They talked solely in terms of military victory. There was no sign of
compromise'.
Mr Cahill became head of the IRA's Army Council in November 1972 and was
involved in negotiating the first Libyan arms shipments for the IRA.
He was arrested by the Irish Navy in March 1973 aboard a West German cargo
ship, accompanying five tons of Libyan arms.
He spent time interned in Northern Ireland and was imprisoned in the
Republic, where he spent 23 days on hunger strike.
Replaced by a younger leadership in the late 1970s, Mr Cahill has remained a
respected figure in the Republican movement.

FT  01 SEP 94 / The IRA Ceasefire: Limits of republican patience may soon be
tested - Nationalists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the 'troubles' began in Northern Ireland 25 years ago, graffiti
appeared on walls in nationalist areas in Belfast and Derry saying 'IRA = I
Ran Away'.
That taunt against the old IRA, which did not want to be drawn into
sectarian conflict with Protestants, provided the rallying cry for a new
generation of republicans who wanted to revive the armed struggle, largely
dormant since the 1950s. The Provisional IRA split with the Official IRA and
has been at the forefront of the conflict ever since.
That new generation is today's old generation, which yesterday announced an
end to its 25-year campaign with a view to joining a purely political battle
for the goal of a united Ireland.
But if Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, is unable to make political
headway there can be little doubt that hardliners will begin to question the
value of the ceasefire. And, if it collapses, the position of Mr Gerry Adams
as Sinn Fein leader and prime mover of its 'peace strategy' will inevitably
fall into question.
If loyalist paramilitaries think that an eventual participation of Sinn Fein
in negotiations is leading to significant political concessions to
nationalists, they may well decide to escalate their own military actions to
undermine the ceasefire, rather than respond in kind to it, as they are
being urged to do.
The 'I Ran Away' taunt could then return to haunt the leaders of Sinn Fein
and the IRA, and create pressure for action in defence of nationalist
communities - or in the worst of scenarios, a replay of the 1970s split that
saw the 'Officials' enter mainstream politics and the young militants carry
on the war.
There is little doubt in the minds of the security forces that the IRA is a
tightly disciplined organisation. Its 'active service units' operate in
small cells. Their weapons are controlled through a separate quartermaster
division, and bunkered in secret sites in the republic and Ulster. The
quartermasters are controlled by the IRA's ruling body, its Army Council.
The possibility of 'maverick' units rejecting the ceasefire and operating
independently of the Army Council is minimal - although not impossible if
weaponry exists outside the control of the leadership.
The IRA is believed to have some 700 automatic rifles, a considerable stock
of machine-guns, millions of rounds of ammunition, two to three tons of
Semtex explosive, plus copious supplies of home-made fertiliser-based
explosive as well as its own-design mortars.
Senior republican officials have repeatedly stressed that the IRA and Sinn
Fein leaderships are moving in tandem on the peace process, and that the
possibility of a rupture will not arise, either between the organisations or
within them.
Some councillors from the Catholic community in Belfast, however, believe
the IRA leadership is prepared to call off the ceasefire if loyalist
killings escalate and the security forces are unable to contain them. Some
200 republicans are said to have been warned by the RUC that loyalists have
details of them.
Sinn Fein blames this leakage of intelligence information on renegade
elements within the security forces sympathetic to the loyalist
paramilitaries. The IRA's commitment to the ceasefire is, therefore, likely
to be in part determined by how the security forces respond to any upsurge
in loyalist violence.
Attempts by armed republican splinter groups - such as the INLA and the IPLO
 -to pick up hardline support from within the IRA by continuing the war are
considered to be limited because of their shortage of weaponry and the
debilitation of their leadership by internal feuding.
The IRA has also been willing to act ruthlessly against its rivals, if it
felt its own territory was being invaded or its leading role threatened. It
is thought that its recent killing of a gangland boss in Dublin may be
linked to the IRA asserting its authority and discipline within the armed
republican movement.
There was a firm belief in political circles in Dublin yesterday that the
IRA is committed to a permanent cessation of violence. But the rapidity with
which the Irish government has moved to reassure Sinn Fein that it will be
quickly incorporated into political talks indicates Dublin's appreciation
that IRA patience has its limits.

FT  01 SEP 94 / The IRA Ceasefire: Clinton hails start of 'new era' - US
reaction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Bill Clinton, the US president, yesterday greeted the IRA's ceasefire as
a 'watershed announcement'.
Mr Clinton said: 'While much work remains to be done, the IRA's decision to
join the political process can mark the beginning of a new era that holds
the promise of peace for all the people of Northern Ireland.'
From the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard, where he is on holiday,
Mr Clinton said: 'I urge the IRA, and all who have supported it, to fulfil
the promise of today's announcement to end the use and support of violence,
just as we continue to call on all parties who have sought to achieve
political goals through the use of violence to cease to do so. There must be
a permanent end to violence.'
Mr Clinton, who spoke by telephone yesterday morning with Mr John Major, the
prime minister, and his Irish counterpart, Mr Albert Reynolds, said he was
'pleased that the US has been able to contribute to this process of
reconciliation', and was ready to assist in advancing the process of peace.
He gave no details of any possible increase in US financial aid to Northern
Ireland. US officials are discussing a financial package, although figures
have not yet been decided.
White House officials said there were no plans yet for any joint meeting of
Mr Clinton, Mr Reynolds and Mr Major, but they were 'aware of interest from
the Irish government' in such a meeting.
Privately, some White House officials see the ceasefire announcement as
vindication of their decision - overriding objections from the Departments
of State and Justice, and the British government - to allow Mr Gerry Adams,
the Sinn Fein president, to enter the US in February.
The European Commission said it would step up its efforts to aid the
province. Mr Jacques Delors, the commission president, took the opportunity
to stress the importance of the 'European dimension'.
He said he would discuss 'additional financial and other measures' with the
UK and Irish governments.
Mrs Pauline Green, leader of the European Parliament's largest bloc, the
198-strong Socialist Group, urged 'all sections of the community in Northern
Ireland to seize the historic opportunity for peace that is now before
them'.

FT  01 SEP 94 / The IRA Ceasefire: Molyneaux holds the power of veto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was no accident that Mr James Molyneaux was in 10 Downing Street within
hours of the IRA's announcement yesterday of an end to its campaign of
violence.
Nor was it by chance that his publicly voiced concerns about the absence in
the IRA statement of the word 'permanent' were echoed by Mr John Major.
Mr Molyneaux, the MP for the Protestant stronghold of Lagan Valley and
leader of the mainstream Ulster Unionists, holds a veto over the prime
minister's search for a durable political settlement in Northern Ireland.
Without his tacit consent, Mr Major could not have struck the political deal
with Dublin which provided the essential backdrop to the IRA's decision.
Mr Molyneaux did not like the Downing Street declaration or the subsequent
clarifications. But he acquiesced.
Had he decided otherwise, Mr Major - an embattled prime minister with a
perilously small majority and plenty of enemies on his own backbenches -
would have had to abandon the enterprise.
The same will be true now. Assuming that the IRA is genuine in its intent,
Mr Molyneaux will have a similar influence over the pace and extent of Mr
Major's government's response. An eventual political settlement will depend
on his signature.
Mr Molyneaux is no soft touch. One of the most experienced figures in Ulster
politics - he has been an MP since 1970 and celebrated his 74th birthday at
the weekend - his commitment to unionism is as strong as any in the
community he represents.
Taciturn but instinctively a shrewd political operator, he has survived
longer than many expected as the top of one of the roughest political
environments in western Europe.
Over 15 years he has headed off several potential challenges to his
leadership of the Official Unionist party, which has nine MPs. He has
contained the threat to his party's position from Mr Ian Paisley's more
extreme Democratic Unionist party.
He is deeply suspicious of any negotiation between London and Dublin. Like
many in the unionist community he sees no reason why the republic should
have any role in discussions on the future of part of another sovereign
state.
His stated preference for a political settlement has been greater
integration of Ulster into the political process at Westminster - or failing
that, the creation of a devolved assembly in the province with no
interference from Dublin.
But Mr Molyneaux is a man of Westminster as well as of the raw politics of
Ulster. He lacks the intemperate bigotry of some in the unionist community.
He believes that if deals are to be made, then it is better to remain on the
inside track than to join Mr Paisley in shouting from the sidelines.
Mr Molyneaux has judged so far that the interests of the unionists would not
be served by derailing the process which led to the IRA ceasefire. And in
spite of his insistence on proof of its permanence, the signs yesterday were
that he is willing to acquiesce in further moves along the same road.
To his opponents in the nationalist community, Mr Molyneaux is a stubborn
and blinkered man whose refusal to admit even the possibility of Irish unity
will be a permanent obstacle to a political settlement. But without him Mr
Major and Mr Reynolds would not have got even this far.

FT  01 SEP 94 / The IRA Ceasefire: Unionists divided in degrees of
scepticism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The response by Northern Ireland's unionists to the IRA ceasefire will be
crucial in determining how far the two governments can respond to it,
consolidating it into what Dublin already believes is a permanent ceasefire.
Initial unionist reactions have been ambivalent and sceptical. Mr Jim
Wilson, general secretary of the Ulster Unionist party, said the IRA
ceasefire did not meet the conditions of the Downing Street declaration and
'should not therefore trigger the process in which Sinn Fein could enter
into exploratory talks with the British government'.
Sitting across the negotiating table from Sinn Fein is 'way, way down the
road', he said. If there is a permanent end to IRA violence though, and
after exploratory talks between Sinn Fein and the British government, 'as a
democratic party we would envisage a situation in which we would talk to
other democratically elected parties'.
Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the UUP, emerged from an hour-long meeting
with prime minister John Major at Downing Street to say that he did not
think the IRA's statement was sufficient to start the clock ticking in the
lead-up to talks between London and Sinn Fein.
'I hope those who have influence with Sinn Fein/IRA will be able to take the
next step and make it permanent,' Mr Molyneaux said.
In a message to loyalist paramilitaries, Mr Molyneaux said there was 'no
justification or excuse for violence on the part of anyone.'
The hardline Democratic Unionist party has been predictably apocalyptic in
its response. Mr Ian Paisley, the DUP leader, was earlier this week warning
of a 'civil war' if the IRA ceasefire involved a deal with the British
government.
Mr Gregory Campbell, a DUP councillor from Derry, said: 'The IRA is
replacing violence as a means of achieving its aims, with the threat of
violence. Does anybody believe there has been no deal? We await with great
interest what the British government has agreed to do in return.'
The DUP remains steadfastly opposed to talks with Sinn Fein at any stage in
the peace process, and has refused to enter round-table talks even with the
other parties in the province unless the Downing Street declaration is
rescinded.
With the prospect of inclusive round-table talks still some way off, of
immediate concern for the politicians and the security forces in Northern
Ireland is whether there will be a backlash from the loyalist paramilitaries
which could undermine the IRA ceasefire.
The Combined Loyalist Military Command, the umbrella group for the two main
protestant paramilitary groups, the UVF and the UFF, appears to be waiting
to see what happens. In a statement yesterday it said: 'We will not be
dancing to the Pan-nationalist tune,' and added: 'Is our constitution being
tampered with or is it not? What deals have been done? End the speculation.
No further comment will be forthcoming from the Combined Loyalist Military
Command at present.'
Perhaps the most encouraging signal that loyalist reaction may be restrained
has come from Mr Hugh Smyth, Belfast's Lord Mayor, who is a member of the
Progressive Unionist party, whose political base is in the loyalist Shankill
Road area in Belfast and is considered close to the Ulster Volunteer Force.
He welcomed yesterday's 'opportunity for peace' and urged the people of
Northern Ireland to 'grasp this opportunity because history will not treat
us kindly if we throw this opportunity away, providing that there is no
sell-out. I believe we should all work now for peace, stability and
political progress through reconciliation.'
He described Republican aspirations for a united Ireland as 'legitimate' as
long as they are not pursued by violent means.
The key issue facing unionist leaders in the weeks ahead, therefore, will be
whether they can bury their differences to confront what is now likely to
emerge as a powerful nationalist alliance with agreed negotiating goals,
between the mainly Catholic SDLP and Sinn Fein in Northern Ireland, backed
by Fianna Fail and Labour in the government in the Republic. Failure to do
so may well see a further erosion of unionist aspirations.

FT  01 SEP 94 / The IRA Ceasefire: Development fund stands to gain new cash
 -International aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL and DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the wheels of peace are to be partly oiled by a fresh injection of
foreign finance, then the International Fund for Ireland is likely to be
among the main recipients.
With reports suggesting that the administration of Mr Bill Clinton, US
president, could provide up to Pounds 130m in aid, the fund - which already
gets Pounds 13m a year from the US government - could soon find itself
receiving extra cash.
At the same time, Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission,
said in London he would be proposing an increase in aid. He added: 'The
future of Northern Ireland is a matter for the Irish, but also a European
matter.'
The fund, which already has the confidence of the US and of European Union
nations, would provide a ready-made conduit for much of the promised
additional money. It was set up in 1986 by the governments of the US and the
Irish Republic and has now established itself as an engine for improvement.
Until recently US budget cuts meant the fund faced a reduction in the annual
contribution voted to it by the US Congress. At the beginning of August,
however, the sum was again fixed at Pounds 13m and the figure could now be
raised several times over. Since 1989 the EU has contributed Ecu15m (Pounds
12m) a year.
The fund, whose total available resources by the end of last year stood at
Pounds 225m, was established by the two governments to promote economic and
social advance both in Northern Ireland and in the six border counties in
the south.
It is also charged with encouraging 'contact, dialogue and reconciliation'
between nationalists and unionists throughout Ireland. Last year it helped
create more than 2,600 jobs.
Although the US and the EU have been among the principal sources of its
finance, the fund has also been supported by Canada and New Zealand.
The board of the fund is appointed jointly by the Irish and British
governments and operations are controlled by joint directors-general based
in Belfast and Dublin. Much of the day-to-day work, however, is carried out
on the fund's behalf by government departments and agencies.
The organisation, which has laid great emphasis on its independent status in
order to give it credibility, has acted as a catalyst in encouraging
economic regeneration in many of the most disadvantaged areas. It provides
seed funding to stimulate public and private-sector investment and also
encourages self-help schemes to bring together alienated communities.
Particular efforts have been made to promote cross-border projects. These,
together with additional help programmes in inner-city areas, could be
significantly expanded.
There have already been a series of 'flagship' cross-border projects, such
as the Shannon-Erne waterway. Aid also goes to creating community-based
businesses, developing science and technology and tourism.
The EU has already allocated Ecu1.23bn in structural aid to Northern Ireland
for 1994-99, up from Ecu1.07bn in 1989-93, mostly to develop infrastructure,
training schemes, research and development and small businesses.
Under a separate programme, the EU intends to spend a further Ecu100m on
improving frontier links between the north and the republic.

FT  01 SEP 94 / The IRA Ceasefire: Markets show first flicker of positive
response - Economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE and WILL LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN, BELFAST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The first flicker of a positive response by the markets to the IRA ceasefire
came yesterday as several Northern Ireland companies made gains on the
London Stock Exchange.
The share prices of companies such as Northern Ireland Electricity and
Ewart, the property developer, advanced by about 5 per cent to 6 per cent,
against an overall FT-SE index gain of 1.7 per cent.
It is obviously early days to assert that a trend is emerging from these
gains, but they are indicative that business confidence in the province will
grow if the ceasefire holds and that economic benefits for the province, and
even for the republic, will flow from an end to the violence.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said yesterday: 'I have always
believed there would be a huge peace dividend for the island of Ireland.'
The first payments on that are expected to come from the US. Mr Reynolds
talked by phone to US President Bill Clinton yesterday, following the IRA
announcement, and said he believed US economic support for the peace process
'is going to be very important'. He added: 'President Clinton assured me
today that he going straight away to work at an economic package to underpin
the peace process in Northern Ireland.'
Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, is to visit Washington shortly
to follow this up.
The US money will boost confidence, but of far greater importance will be
decisions by the business community - both local and from overseas - on
whether to boost investment in the province.
An FT survey of business opinion in Northern Ireland in December last year
revealed that more than half of the 56 leading companies surveyed believed
that a political settlement, arising from an end to violence, would have a
very positive effect on business and economic opportunities in Northern
Ireland. A further 38 per cent believed that the effect would be 'fairly
positive'.
An additional benefit from an ending of the IRA bombing campaign will be a
sharp reduction in compensation costs. The Northern Ireland Office currently
pays between Pounds 30m and Pounds 50m a year to individual and corporate
victims of the violence.
The stationing of some 19,000 British troops in the province, and the
maintenance of the RUC police force at a strength of around 12,000, imposes
an even heavier burden on the Exchequer - thought to be in excess of Pounds
1bn per year. In addition, there is an Exchequer subsidy to Northern Ireland
of a further Pounds 3bn.
Economic development will reduce unemployment, raise the taxation base and
allow a reduction in this subsidy, which if required could be recycled into
investment projects.
A joint statement by Mr Doug Riley, chairman of the Confederation of British
Industry in Northern Ireland, and Mr Paddy Murphy, president of the Chamber
of Commerce and Industry, said 'real economic benefits' would flow from
'peace and creation of a stable political framework based on agreed
democratic principles'.
Potential benefits included improved confidence leading to more investment
and cross-border trade, the development of new products and 'a more
expansive approach which could mean significant new employment
opportunities'.
Yesterday most small businesses along the Catholic Falls Road and the
Protestant Shankill Road were sceptical about the effect of the IRA's
statement on their businesses.
Mrs Jan Cheevers, owner of Stevensons florists in the Shankill Road, said:
'If peace comes then it may help me, but I can't see that happening.' Her
shop is next door to the fish shop bombed by the IRA last October. Nine
people and the bomber died. 'There is no trust any more,' she said. Nearly
all of her customers are Protestants.
A newsagent in the Falls Road who did not wish to be named said: 'I suppose
we may get some more tourists up here now, but really things are likely to
go on much the same.'
The manager of a taxi company based on the Falls Road said that the only
benefit he would get was from increased aid from the US. 'If this leads to
Clinton giving us more money then that obviously is good. But other than
that business will probably go on as normal.'

FT  01 SEP 94 / The IRA Ceasefire: Prize of peace in Ulster has never been
closer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It may be too soon to celebrate. It is not too early for hope to displace
the cynicism that has long suffocated politics in Northern Ireland.
The prospects for a permanent peace remain uncertain. But the prize has
never been closer since the present round of killings started 25 years ago.
The grip of history has been loosened.
Building a political settlement in a province where many are more frightened
of peace than of war will not be easy. The misery inflicted on the people of
Ulster by the mindless killings is matched only by the mutual mistrust
across the sectarian divide. The habit of murder is deeply ingrained.
Nor does it take much understanding of the past to appreciate that the
objectives of the IRA and of the unionist majority are as irreconcilable
today as they have ever been.
After so many vicious murders over so many years, no one can be expected to
take the IRA statement on trust. There was no mention of that most critical
word - permanent.
It may be that the present generation of republican leaders has given up
hope of military victory. Certainly some in British intelligence share that
view. History however - still an insidiously powerful force in Northern
Ireland - reminds us that past ceasefires have split the republican
movement. The killing has then resumed.
The IRA remains as strong militarily as it has ever been. Some of its
commanders will be looking for an opportunity to resume what they call the
armed struggle.
The response of the so-called loyalist paramilitaries - responsible in
recent years for about half the killing in the province - will be crucial.
The Rev Ian Paisley's warning of civil war was characteristically
forthright. The hard-line Democratic Unionist leader is right, though, that
the working-class Protestants need persuading that the price of peace has
not been a weakening of Britain's commitment to the province.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish
counterpart, have shown rare determination and grit in pushing the process
this far.
Mr Major, as beleaguered a prime minister as any in recent history, shrugged
off the brickbats of colleagues who whispered behind their hands that last
December's Downing Street declaration was destined to fail.
He has gone as far as a Conservative leader could to rebuild trust with
Ulster's nationalists and with the Dublin government. The personal risks
have been considerable. So too have been his negotiating skills.
Mr Major has managed thus far to avoid a backlash from the moderate majority
among the unionists by ensuring that the door of 10 Downing Street has been
ever open to Mr James Molyneaux, the leader of the Ulster Unionists. He has
been rewarded by acquiescence, if not enthusiasm, from the leader of the
province's most important political party.
It will be harder now than it has ever been to sustain that careful
political balancing act. But if the IRA statement does presage peace,
Ireland could rescue Mr Major's premiership.
Both prime ministers will have to take more risks. There will be many
calling themselves Catholics or Protestants determined to wreck the
initiative. There will be strains between London and Dublin.
The contrasting tone of the responses in the two capitals underlines the
danger. The understandable euphoria in Dublin was not echoed in Downing
Street. Mr Major's statement spoke in more measured terms of the need to
confirm that this is more than a pause in the killing.
The risk is that an ambiguous ceasefire will create a rift between London
and Dublin; that Mr Reynolds will be too eager to respond quickly to the IRA
statement and that Mr Major will be unduly cautious.
The political compromises behind the Downing Street declaration and the
search for a new constitutional framework for Ulster would then be
threatened. Some in Whitehall believe that has been the IRA's game-plan all
along.
So the two governments must stick firmly to their public pledge that there
will be a place at the negotiating table for Sinn Fein, the IRA's political
wing, only when it is clear the renunciation of violence is irrevocable.
The fundamental principle on which co-operation between London and Dublin
has been based is that of consent - in short, it is (and always will be) for
the people of Northern Ireland to decide their own future.
For all his government's protestations that nothing has changed in its
attitude to the future of Ulster, Mr Major has moved in the direction of the
nationalists.
He has made explicit what has been implicit, but carefully hidden, in the
approach of successive governments since 1973 - that Britain has no 'selfish
or strategic' interest in maintaining Ulster as part of the union - it will
do so only if and for as long as a majority in the province so wish.
For his part Mr Reynolds has been obliged to admit the legitimacy of the
unionist veto - that the nationalists' longstanding demand for
self-determination in Ireland cannot override the wishes of a majority in
Northern Ireland.
That principle must remain inviolate. If Mr Major steps just an inch over
the line dividing neutrality from persuasion he will lose the support of
moderate unionists and face a backlash on his own back benches.
In his understandable enthusiasm to ensure that the chance of peace is not
lost, Mr Reynolds must be careful to ensure that reassurances to the
unionists offered by London are not undercut by nationalist triumphalism in
Dublin.
Every step for the next few weeks will be an awkward one. There are ways in
which the British government can respond quickly to the cessation of
violence - by lifting the broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein, by changing the
pattern of policing in Northern Ireland - which involve few risks.
But it cannot allow the slightest hint that its actions are being driven by
the threat of a resumption of IRA killing.
Mr Major and Mr Reynolds must move quickly to finalise the outline plans for
a political settlement they have been promising since early summer.
The shape is clear - dilution of the republic's constitutional claim to
Northern Ireland, changes in Britain's 1920 Government of Ireland Act to
enshrine the principle of consent, a devolved Northern Ireland assembly and
new cross-border institutions to build trust.
It is talks on this document that Sinn Fein will be invited to join if in,
say, two or three months' time the IRA has proved its good intent.
You do not have to search too hard around Westminster to find those
confident that even if the process gets that far, the nationalists' demand
for a united Ireland and the determination of the Protestant majority to
sustain the union will quickly restore the familiar deadlock.
History is on the side of the cynics. But this time there is a decent chance
the future will not be a prisoner of the past. The police said yesterday
that 3,168 people had died in the sectarian terror which has engulfed
Northern Ireland for 25 years. Maybe, just maybe, that is enough even for
the IRA.
