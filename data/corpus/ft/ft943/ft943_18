FT  01 SEP 94 / The IRA Ceasefire: Next step hangs on the missing word
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN

<TEXT>
The ceasefire is complete - but is it permanent? On that question yesterday
hinged what happens next in the Northern Ireland peace process.
When it flashed on to news screens at 11.54 am, the IRA's statement
contained many fine phrases and much grounds for optimism.
But it pointedly avoided committing the organisation to the permanent
cessation of violence which London and Dublin have demanded before allowing
Sinn Fein into political talks on the province's future. Instead it promised
a 'complete cessation of military operations' as of midnight last night.
It might seem churlish to quibble over semantics on one of the most historic
days in the province's recent history. But IRA leaders must have known that
their statement would be judged by many on the basis of whether it committed
them to a permanent ceasefire.
It seems inconceivable, therefore, that the word's exclusion was not
carefully judged and deliberate. This was certainly the view of unionists,
who quickly warned that the statement did not fulfil the two governments'
terms.
Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, said bluntly it could
not 'trigger' the countdown of the three-month period within which London
has promised to enter preliminary dialogue with Sinn Fein in the event of a
permanent end to violence.
It is crucial that Mr Molyneaux stays on board if the revitalised peace
process is to stand any chance of success.
Mr John Major's initial response to the statement, first circulated about
lunchtime, was somewhat ambiguous. 'I am greatly encouraged by this, but we
need to be clear that this is indeed intended to be a permanent renunciation
of violence, that is to say, for good,' he said, implying that the clock
would not start ticking without clarification from republican leaders.
'If they are genuinely and irrevocably committed to use only peaceful and
democratic methods in the future, then we shall respond positively.'
But his exhortation to 'let words now be reflected in deeds,' suggested it
might be acceptable for the clarification to take the form of an extended
period without violence.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, later aligned the government
firmly with Mr Molyneaux, however, saying that the question of permanency
had to be resolved before the government would consider that the three-month
period had started.
'This is so important a matter that it ought not to be left at large or able
to be the subject of discussion and argument,' Sir Patrick said.
His words appeared to open up daylight between the government's stance and
the position of Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, who said he
thought IRA violence was permanently finished.
It also opened the prospect of a tense period of cat-and-mouse politics
involving the two governments and republican leaders, similar to that which
followed the Downing Street declaration.
Under the timetable set out by the government, preliminary talks would begin
with Sinn Fein within three months of it receiving the assurances it
requires. This would have three purposes:
To explore the basis on which Sinn Fein would be admitted to an 'inclusive
political talks process'.
To exchange views on how Sinn Fein would be able in time to play the same
part as the other constitutional parties in Ulster's public life.
To examine the practical consequences of ending violence.
These practical matters would be expected to include the handing in of IRA
weapons, the treatment of IRA prisoners, the question of security and the
broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein representatives.
Some ministers believe the ban no longer serves any useful purpose and
should be lifted as soon as possible.
On troop deployment, the government is expected to emphasise that decisions
are the responsibility of military commanders. But a reduction of troop
strength in response to a reduction in the perceived threat of violence has
not been ruled out.

<TEXT>
'Recognising the potential of the current situation and in order to enhance
the democratic process and underlying our definitive commitment to its
success, the leadership of the IRA have decided that as of midnight, August
31, there will be a complete cessation of military operations. All our units
have been instructed accordingly.
'At this historic crossroads the leadership of the IRA salutes and commends
our volunteers, other activists, our supporters and the political prisoners
who have sustained the struggle against all odds for the past 25 years.
'Your courage, determination and sacrifice have demonstrated that the
freedom and the desire for peace based on a just and lasting settlement
cannot be crushed. We remember all those who have died for Irish freedom and
we reiterate our commitment to our republican objectives.
'Our struggle has seen many gains and advances made by nationalists and for
the democratic position. We believe that an opportunity to secure a just and
lasting settlement has been created.
'We are therefore entering into a new situation in a spirit of determination
and confidence determined that the injustices which created this conflict
will be removed and confident in the strength and justice of our struggle to
achieve this. We note that the Downing Street Declaration is not a
solution.'
'A solution will only be found as a result of inclusive negotiations.
Others, not least the British Government, have a duty to face up to their
responsibilities.
'In our desire to significantly contribute to the creation of a climate
which will encourage this, we urge everybody to approach this new situation
with determination and patience.'

FT  01 SEP 94 / Splits follow an election defeat: Main Mexican opposition
parties troubled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Divisions have emerged within Mexico's two main opposition parties,
following their heavy defeat in the presidential election of August 21.
Both the leftist and centre-right opposition have blamed unfair electoral
conditions - the ruling party's massive spending in the campaign and its
favourable television coverage - as the key reason for defeat.
But both opposition parties are internally divided on the best way to push
for fairer future elections, and how far they should co-operate, if at all,
with the administration of Mr Ernesto Zedillo of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI), due to take office in early-December.
The leftist Party of Democratic Revolution (PRD) - which came third with
17.1 per cent of the vote - is increasingly split between a radical faction,
which supports challenging the election results through civic protests, and
a moderate wing which believes that the party should move to the centre, and
focus on presenting evidence of fraud to electoral tribunals.
Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the party's presidential candidate, appears caught
between the two wings. He has denounced the election as fraudulent - even
though most observers believe reported irregularities did not affect the
result. Yet he has called on his supporters to avoid the sort of mass
mobilisations that have given the party a reputation for extremism.
Also, Mr Cardenas, who has so far held the party's two tendencies together,
has said he will not run for office again. Hence his ability to unify the
party's various factions may diminish.
The leaders of the centre-right National Action Party (PAN) have implicitly
accepted the victory of Mr Zedillo and the PRI. However, under pressure from
many of their supporters, the leaders have stepped up attacks on the
fairness of the Mexican political system and questioned the legitimacy, if
not the legality, of the result. On Tuesday, the PAN called for new laws to
govern the conduct of political parties and to separate the PRI from the
government.
The PAN's divisions are less profound than those of the PRD, in part because
the former won a greater proportion of the vote than ever before. The party
won 119 of the 500 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, 48 more than the PRD,
and will have 24 seats in the expanded Senate. For many, the results are a
vindication of the PAN's strategy of maintaining good relations with the
government.
Even so, the PAN's failure to win much more than a quarter of the national
vote has led to criticisms of close co-operation with the government in
recent years, and its acceptance of electoral conditions that favour the
PRI. Some even wonder whether Mr Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, the party's
presidential candidate last month, had done a deal with the PRI to lose the
election.
The PAN has been particularly hurt by heavy losses in the three states which
it governs - Baja California, Guanajuato and Chihuahua. The PAN had hoped
that these local strongholds would act as a springboard for national
victory. The PAN's best showing was in states firmly controlled by the PRI -
Jalisco, Nuevo Leon and Sonora, indicating that much of its support is based
on a protest vote.
Mr Vicente Fox, the PAN leader from Guanajuato, last week attacked Mr
Fernandez for having accepted the PRI victory and having described the
electoral process as clean.
Such internal criticisms have led to a notable hardening in statements by Mr
Fernandez over recent days. In an outspoken television interview on Sunday
night, he sharply criticised the extravagant campaign spending of Mr Zedillo
and the favourable coverage the latter had received on television. The PAN
leader withheld a full endorsement of Mr Zedillo's victory, describing it as
an illegitimate triumph.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Cubans risk all for better life: A look at economic pressure
to become a refugee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PASCAL FLETCHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As talks begin in New York today on the Cuban refugee crisis even government
officials in Havana admit that life has become plagued with hardships for
the island's 11m people.
The chronic shortages of food and other basic goods are the result of the
worst economic crisis in the 35-year history of the Cuban revolution. It
followed the collapse after 1990 of preferential trade and aid links with
the now defunct Soviet bloc.
While hundreds of Cubans risk their lives trying to reach the US in flimsy,
home-made rafts, those who stay behind view their departure with mixed
emotions.
'I'm a revolutionary and all that I have I owe to the revolution,' said Mr
Roberto Perez from Havana. He was explaining why he had not joined five
members of his family who, with nine others, clambered aboard a rickety
half-raft, half-boat that set off this week from a beach at Cojmar, east of
Havana. Their craft joined a dozen others on Monday afternoon aiming for
Florida.
Mr Perez added: 'Besides, I'm 54 and black. What am I going to do over
there?'
Gesturing towards his departing relatives, a brother, a sister-in-law and
three teenage grandchildren, he went on: 'I don't criticise them. They are
young, they aspire to other things. If I were young, I would go too.'
Further along the beach another elderly man was staying behind. 'I would
like things to improve here so that people wouldn't have to go,' he said.
Fear of making the risky, 90-mile sea crossing, reluctance to leave behind
family and friends and hopes that things might eventually improve are all
factors keeping many Cubans from joining the exodus from the communist-ruled
Caribbean state.
There is an air of desolation about the streets of Havana. The decaying
buildings and potholed streets of and the lack of shops, restaurants and
businesses operating normally are symptoms of an economic squeeze made worse
by a longstanding US trade embargo.
The desire for a 'better life' is the motive most cited by the departing
rafters, who appear undeterred by the change in policy announced by US
President Bill Clinton in mid-August. The change means that Cubans who try
to leave without visas will now not be granted automatic entry to the US as
they had been for years. They face indefinite detention at the US naval base
at Guantanamo Bay in eastern Cuba or at other US detention centres.
The dispute over immigration is part of the wider US-Cuban conflict and will
be at the centre of the talks in New York between high-ranking Cuban and US
officials. Senior US officials have made clear they are willing to discuss
ways of controlling the exodus of Cuban refugees, but not much else.
Cuban President Fidel Castro, who criticised Mr Clinton's recent policy
change towards the Cuban refugees as 'absurd', has said the talks should
include lifting the US embargo and ending the barrage of anti-communist
radio and television broadcasts directed from the US.
He also wants an immediate end to new sanctions announced this month by Mr
Clinton, which included a virtual halt to US dollar remittances from Cuban
Americans to relatives on the island.
Heading the Cuban delegation will be Mr Ricardo Alarcon, a prominent figure
in the communist party hierarchy and head of the island's National Assembly.
He is a former foreign minister and ambassador to the United Nations.
Mr Alarcon is an experienced diplomat who has faced the Americans before in
immigration negotiations. He helped to negotiate a previous immigration
accord in 1984, four years after the so-called Mariel 'boatlift' by which
about 125,000 Cubans left the island. Mr Alarcon is a staunch defender of
the island's one-party political system and can be expected to resist any US
demands for reforms in that area.
The Cubans hope the pressure generated by the humanitarian problem of the
refugees will persuade Mr Clinton to change the policy of hostility towards
Mr Castro's rule practised by successive US administrations since shortly
after the 1959 Cuban revolution. This may be a vain hope, as US officials
such as Ms Janet Reno, the attorney-general, have publicly blamed the
refugee exodus on the Cuban leadership.
Some relief to the refugee problem may come from third nations such as
Canada and Mexico, which have said they are willing to take some Cuban
refugees with families already living in their countries.
Meanwhile, as the exodus of rafters continues, Cubans staying behind will
wait to see if this week's talks can break the 30-year deadlock of
hostility.

FT  01 SEP 94 / US signs bilateral tax pacts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US yesterday signed new tax agreements with France and Canada, as US
Treasury officials stepped up a programme of negotiations aimed at
overhauling Washington's network of bilateral tax treaties, writes George
Graham.
In a protocol to their original 1980 treaty, the US and Canada agreed to big
changes in withholding taxes expected to save multinational companies
millions of dollars.
Canada agreed to drop altogether its 10 per cent withholding tax on
royalties, as well as to lower the withholding rates on interest from 15 per
cent to 10 per cent and on direct investment dividends from 10 per cent to 5
per cent.
The result is expected to be a large saving for US businesses receiving
royalties from Canada since most are not able to deduct the withholding from
their US tax bill.
The two tax pacts are expected to be sent to the US Senate for ratification
this month.

FT  01 SEP 94 / County's derivatives loss fuels calls for legislation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Heavy losses on financial derivatives trading by a county administration in
Maryland are fuelling calls in the US Congress for legislation to tighten
oversight of the derivatives market.
Charles County, Maryland, said its deputy treasurer had been dismissed after
the county discovered a loss of an estimated Dollars 1.3m (Pounds 850,000)
on investments in derivatives, including mortgage-backed securities. The
investments also tied up about Dollars 27m, a quarter of the county's annual
budget, in securities, which Mr Roger Fink, county attorney, says the local
government was not authorised to buy.
In a move that echoes the lengthy legal battle in the UK over Hammersmith
and Fulham council's investments in swaps, the Maryland county has filed
suit against the brokers involved in the trades to seek the return of the
money invested. The British House of Lords ruled in 1990 that local
government purchases of swaps were ultra vires and thus void.
Mr Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the US House of Representatives banking
committee, said the losses confirmed the need for derivatives legislation,
for which he has been arguing. 'How many more firms, pension funds and
counties are we going to read about losing money due to derivatives before
the Congress takes action?' he asked.
The addition of local taxpayers to the list of losers in the fast-moving
markets for derivatives - complex securities whose return is derived from
another security or index - is expected to increase concern in Congress.
In earlier congressional hearings on the need for tougher regulation of
derivatives, many members said they were unmoved by news that large and
sophisticated multinational companies, which should be able to look after
themselves, had lost money in derivatives trading. Local government
treasurers and local taxpayers, however, arouse more sympathy in Congress.
Charles County faced a cash crisis as a consequence of the trades. The
county saw itself as having been without authority, under state law, to have
bought securities with a maturity longer than 270 days. Because it believed
it never legally owned them, it could not sell them, Mr Fink said yesterday.
However, to avoid freezing the securities during years of litigation, the
county and the brokers being sued subsequently agreed to sell the portfolio.
Mr Stephen Johnson, deputy treasurer but now dismissed, is running for
election in November as treasurer. Ms Thelma Bowie, the treasurer who
appointed Mr Johnson as her deputy, announced last week that she would
resign before the election.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The middle class in the US is being divided by its levels of education and
skills, according to Mr Robert Reich, US labour secretary.
In a pre-Labor Day speech on the state of the workforce yesterday, Mr Reich
said: 'The deepest divisions (in US society) aren't based on race or on
national origin or on geography. They're based on the ability of individuals
to make their way in an increasingly turbulent society.'
Whereas in 1979 a 'middle class' male with a college degree earned 49 per
cent more than one with a high school diploma, by 1992 the college graduate
was earning 83 per cent more. The unemployment rate for college graduates
has stayed at around 3 per cent but for those who did not finish high school
it has jumped from 7 per cent in the 1970s to 12 per cent last year.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Forecasting index points to US economic slowdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US government's principal economic forecasting measure stayed flat in
July, adding to economists' growing certainty that the economy is slowing
down and could avoid the sort of boom and bust that has plagued most past
expansions.
The Commerce Department said its index of leading economic indicators, a
composite of eleven statistics such as manufacturers' orders and stock
market prices which is intended to gauge the strength of the economy roughly
six months ahead, was unchanged in July at 101.5. The index has risen
steadily for the last 12 months but, after going up by more than 2 per cent
in the last half of 1993, it has gained only a little over 1 per cent in the
first half of this year.
A large majority of economic forecasters, ranging from the Clinton
administration to the consensus of private-sector economists, now expects
some form of soft landing for the economy over the next two years. Instead
of rapid growth - leading companies to raise the prices of their products
and workers to increase their wage demands - the Federal Reserve's policy of
raising interest rates in five steps this year is expected to have taken
enough steam out of the economy to prevent overheating.
But the expansion is then expected to continue, though at a steadier pace,
for some time, with the Fed not needing to raise interest rates dramatically
to choke off inflation.
Yesterday's economic data added to the view in the financial markets that
the economy is losing speed, and that growth in the third quarter of this
year is likely to be slower than in the second.
Only three of the index's components - changes in the price of sensitive
materials, building permits, and average weekly claims for unemployment
insurance - increased in July, while six elements fell.
At the same time, the Commerce Department said new orders for manufactured
goods fell by 2.3 per cent in July to a seasonally adjusted level of Dollars
273.3bn. This takes manufacturing orders to their lowest level since
February.
One other indicator, the Chicago purchasing managers' index, dropped to 61.6
per cent in August from 63.0 per cent in July, but showed a sharp increase
in prices paid for materials.
The closely watched National Purchasing Managers' index is due to be
published today. But the attention of the financial markets is most closely
focused on the employment statistics, to be announced tomorrow, which Mr
John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers in New York, called 'the
bedrock of indicators for future demand growth'.
When it announced its latest tightening of monetary policy on August 16  -
an increase of half a percentage point to take the discount rate to 4 per
cent - the Fed said it expected this action 'to be sufficient, at least for
a time, to meet the objective of sustained, non-inflationary growth'.
Unless there are signs of continued rapid growth in employment, most
economists expect the Fed to wait at least until November before considering
any further tightening.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Caricom supports Haiti invasion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES

<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Neighbours of Haiti yesterday agreed to support a US-led invasion of the
Caribbean republic, saying the refusal of the military leaders there to step
down had closed the door to a negotiated settlement of the country's
political crisis.
Mr Strobe Talbott, US deputy secretary of state, and Mr John Deutch, US
deputy defence secretary, yesterday attended a meeting of the Caribbean
Community (Caricom) in Jamaica, to agree on the Caribbean nations' role in
an invasion.
Mr Paul Robertson, Jamaica's foreign minister, said yesterday that Caricom
troops would not take part in an invasion, but would be involved in a
'holding operation' before the deployment of a UN mission in Haiti.
Caricom's decision was a 'watershed', which indicated 'a sense of increasing
urgency' in dealing with Haiti, said Mr Talbott.
Caribbean countries have been reluctant to get involved in Haiti militarily,
fearing domestic opposition to entanglement in a problem seen as
intractable, as well as to a possible flood of refugees. But they see a
holding operation as a way to address these fears.
About 300 Caribbean troops would be involved, their task being to maintain
law and order before, and perhaps after, the return to Haiti from exile of
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, said a Caricom official. Caricom is made
up of 13 English speaking-members, but only those with standing armies -
Antigua, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Guyana, Jamaica, and Trinidad and
Tobago - will be involved.
'As this has been done by some of their closest neighbours, albeit some
without military might, the Haitian leaders must now know that foreign
military intervention is imminent unless they step down in a few days,' said
a Caricom spokesman.
Military staff officers from the Caribbean countries will join their US,
British and Argentine counterparts to 'finalise and co-ordinate
arrangements' for the military intervention in Haiti, said Mr Erskine
Sandiford, prime minister of Barbados and Caricom chairman. The Caribbean
contingent will be trained at a US naval base in eastern Puerto Rico.
US and Caribbean officials refused to be drawn on the timing of an invasion
of Haiti. But Caribbean military sources said the plans were in place and
only awaited President Bill Clinton's authorisation. They expected that US
forces, led by special groups such as naval Seals, would infiltrate Haiti
under the cover of darkness and disable strategic targets, including command
and control centres of the Haitian military.
Some Haitian junior officers, according to Caribbean military sources, have
been holding clandestine meetings with representatives of foreign
intelligence agencies, mainly the US, and have committed themselves to
support the invasion.

FT  01 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Asia-Pacific pledge urged on trade curbs
</HEADLINE>

Leaders of the 17 countries of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
should commit themselves this year to eliminating by 2020 all barriers to
trade and investment in the region, an international advisory panel has
recommended.
The panel's report says liberalisation should not be confined to Apec
countries, but should seek to reinforce the multilateral trade system by
simultaneously extending the benefits of freer trade to non-members. The
report is the most detailed effort yet to draft a blueprint for the
development of the five-year-old organisation.
It was drafted by a 16-member eminent persons' group at the request of last
year's Apec summit in Seattle.
The authors call on Apec leaders to agree at their next meeting, in Jakarta
in November, to launch the liberalisation programme in the year 2000 and to
pledge themselves to completing it over the next 20 years.
Though the report's recommendations are unan-imously backed by its authors,
some have admitted that they do not expect all their proposals to win
political approval quickly.
Mr Neville Wran, Australia's representative on the eminent persons' group,
said yesterday that the liberalisation timetable yesterday was some-thing of
a vision, and that over-hasty efforts to turn Apec into a more formal
organisation could damage confidence in it.
Apec members have already displayed sharp differences about the pace and
direction of future development. While the report's findings seem likely to
be broadly favoured by industrialised countries such as the US and
Australia, reactions in Asia are expected to be more mixed.
The report says more advanced Apec members should dismantle all their trade
and investment barriers by 2010, and developing countries by 2020.
As well as tackling border obstacles, liberalisation should extend to such
matters as government procurement and technical standards.
The authors say the programme should aim for 'open regionalism' by building
on - and in some cases going beyond - the principles of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
They emphasise that Apec should not become a customs union and should avoid
the 'over-institutionalisation and over-bureaucratisation' typified by the
European Union.
'Without any reservation whatsoever, we strongly oppose the creation of a
trading bloc that would be inward-looking and would divert from the pursuit
of global free trade,' the report says.
Individual Apec countries should instead be encouraged to liberalise trade
unilaterally as fast as possible, while the organisation should be ready to
negotiate concessions with non-members on a reciprocal basis. However, the
report says that unless Apec leaders move rapidly to launch a liberalisation
drive, the group's achievement could be jeopardised by fragmentation and
discrimination caused by a proliferation of sub-regional economic groupings.
To prevent this happening, the authors call on groupings such as the North
American Free Trade Area to undertake to extend to the whole of Apec the
trade preferences enjoyed by their members.

British Steel said yesterday it was in talks about a three-way joint venture
which would bring together the company's large-diameter welded pipe business
with Usinor-Sacilor, the French steel group, and Mannesmann, the German
engineering group.
The possible joint venture would be the first time that three European
steelmakers have pooled such resources.
'It is a highly competitive and variable world market,' a spokesman said.
'There is over-capacity so it's only natural that companies should be
talking to each other.'
The talks, which a British Steel spokesman said were at a 'preliminary'
stage, are designed to create a three-way venture out of Europipe, a
three-year-old joint venture between Mannesmannrohren-Werke, the German
partner, and Dillinger Huttenwerke, a subsidiary of Usinor-Sacilor. The
talks are not expected to reach any conclusion until early next year,
British Steel said.
Mr Brian Moffat, British Steel chairman, has repeatedly urged European
steelmakers to discuss mergers and alliances which would help lift depressed
steel prices and cut over-capacity. 'Cross-border mergers and alliances are
inevitable and desirable,' he said in a recent speech.
However, a spokesman for British Steel admitted that the company had had no
major successes with these efforts because of what he described as 'in-built
resistance' among European steel producers.
So far British Steel has two European joint ventures, Avesta Sheffield and
European Electrical Steels, both with Swedish steel companies.
Large-diameter pipes represent about 25 per cent of British Steel's total
pipe and tube capacity.
The company produces around 200,000 tonnes of large-diameter pipes a year at
its works in Stockton and Hartlepool in the UK, where it recently modernised
the 42-inch pipe mill.
A spokesman for Mannesmann declined to give any details about Europipe's
turnover.

FT  01 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Rolls-Royce seeks bigger Airbus share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Rolls-Royce, the British aero-engine manufacturer, is seeking to win a
greater share of the European Airbus market after two decades in which it
favoured supplying engines for rival US aircraft manufacturers including
Boeing and Lockheed.
The move reflects the UK company's reassessment of the growing penetration
by Airbus of the market for large aircraft. Airbus has now secured about 30
per cent of the world market and set itself a target to increase this share
to 50 per cent over the next decade, according to Mr Jean Pierson, the
Airbus chief executive.
Rolls-Royce, which is expected to report higher first-half profits today, at
present only provides the Trent 700 engine for the Airbus A330 twin-engine
wide-body airliner, although it participates with other companies in the
V2500 engine powering the smaller A320 and A321 twin-engine narrow-body
airliners.
The UK company's hopes hinge on the development of a new 40,000lb thrust
engine to equip a new larger-range version of the A340 four-engine wide-body
aircraft. This is currently powered only by CFM engines jointly manufactured
by General Electric of the US and Snecma of France.
This new engine could also have applications for advanced versions of the
older A310 wide-body airliner currently under study at Airbus.
Airbus confirmed yesterday it was holding intense studies with all three
leading aero-engine manufacturers (Rolls-Royce, Pratt &amp; Whitney and GE) on
the development of a new 40,000lb thrust engine.
Mr Pierson said the consortium expected to take a technical decision on a
longer-range version of the A340 next year. The ultimate aim was to develop
an ultra-long-range aircraft capable of flying a one-stop round-the-world
trip. The new engine would have a market estimated at about 5,000 units for
both the A340 and the new A310 advanced aircraft.
Rolls-Royce, whose first Trent 700 engine made its debut on an A330 airliner
for Cathay Pacific yesterday, is also seeking opportunities to equip other
future Airbus products with its expanded engine family as well as with
possible new power plants.
Rolls-Royce's intention was to offer engines for Airbus programmes including
possible replacements of the older A300 and A310 wide-body airliners, future
derivatives of the A330 and A340 and the proposed A3XX super-jumbo, said Mr
John Rose, Rolls-Royce's deputy managing director.
Airbus, which is also collaborating with Boeing on a possible development of
a super-jumbo aircraft, plans to have a scale model of its proposed A3XX on
display at the Farnborough Air Show next week. It says the new four-engine
super-jumbo - capable of carrying up to 840 passengers in one class with a
possibility of going up to 1,000 in a stretched version of the aircraft -
would not require the development of a new engine but could be equipped by
power plants like the Trent 700 and its US rivals.
But demand for a super-jumbo is not expected to emerge until the next
decade. Mr Peter Sutch, chairman of Cathay Pacific, said the Hong Kong
airline did not envisage a need for a super-jumbo until around 2003. It
unveiled yesterday a new corporate livery to reflect what Mr Sutch called 'a
changed and revitalised airline moving into a new era'.
Both British Airways and Singapore Airlines have already expressed interest
in acquiring a super-jumbo.
Mr Pierson yesterday welcomed the roll-out of the first A330 equipped with a
Rolls-Royce power plant, saying it was 'high time we saw a made-in-Europe
engine on an Airbus aircraft'. With a Rolls-Royce engine and British
Aerospace's 20 per cent share in Airbus, the UK content of the A330s ordered
by Cathay Pacific topped 50 per cent.
Mr Rose said the A330 was 'one more building block' in the UK company's
relationship with Airbus. 'We must now build up this relationship,' he
added. But Rolls-Royce is also interested in developing its share on new US
Boeing aircraft, including the 777 twin engine wide-body airliner and Boeing
studies to develop a larger version of its 747 jumbo or a new very large
aircraft.

FT  01 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Victory for Taipei as air links with Japan
are boosted
</HEADLINE>

Taiwan and Japan have agreed to expand air links between the two countries
for the first time since a civil aviation pact was agreed in 1975.
The accord allows each side to appoint two carriers to provide air services
between Taiwan and Japan, Taiwan's transport ministry said yesterday.
It adds a new route, Taipei to Fukuoka and increases flights on the existing
routes between Taipei and Nagoya and between Tokyo and Okinawa.
The outcome of the talks marks an important victory for Taipei, which for
two years has been thwarted by Beijing in its efforts to expand services to
Japan to meet increased demand.
It also represents a coup for EVA Airways, Taiwan's first privately owned
international carrier.
Taiwan's flag carrier, China Airlines, and Japan Asia Airways currently
provide regular flights between Taiwan and Japan.
EVA, founded in 1991 by the Evergreen group, the shipping concern, will
share the expanded routes with Japan's Air Nippon, a subsidiary of All
Nippon Airways.
The accord was not an unqualified success, however, as the two sides were
unable to establish direct air links between Taipei and Osaka's new Kansai
Airport, an important route for business travel.
Negotiations over this route were stymied by objections from Beijing. Japan
switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1972.
Trade and investment ties between Taiwan and Japan have grown rapidly in
recent years. Two-way trade climbed to USDollars 32.1bn last year from
Dollars 8.06bn in 1983, with Taiwan posting a record bilateral trade deficit
of Dollars 14.2bn in 1993.

Singapore Airport Terminal Services (Sats) is teaming up with Vietnamese
groups in a USDollars 15m venture to provide cargo handling services at Ho
Chi Minh City airport, in the south of Vietnam.
Sats, a subsidiary of Singapore Airlines (SIA), will hold a 30 per cent
stake in the venture, with the rest controlled by Vietnam Airlines and a
local Vietnamese company.
Sats says that cargo traffic between Singapore and Vietnam rose by more than
60 per cent in the past year, while passenger traffic between the two
countries increased by more than 40 per cent in the first six months of
1994.
Sats is already participating in the development of an airfreight terminal
in the Chinese capital, Beijing, and is involved also in setting up a flight
catering operation in Karachi, Pakistan.

FT  01 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Indian imports of oil set to fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
India's oil imports are expected to fall by 6m tonnes in the current
financial year (April 1994-March 1995), following an increase in domestic
crude production, saving the country nearly Rs23bn (Dollars 733m) in foreign
exchange at current international prices.
Crude oil imports are expected to drop to 24m tonnes this year, from 30m
tonnes in 1993-94, according to figures released yesterday by Indian Oil
Corporation, one of India's largest public sector units, and the canalising
agency for the import of crude oil and selected petroleum products.
However, petroleum product imports were expected to rise to 13m-15m tonnes,
from 12.64m last year. This increase is due in large measure to the increase
in demand for diesel (for tractors) when the country has had a good monsoon.
Mr J L Zutshi, chairman of Indianoil, yesterday announced the corporation's
net profit of Rs7.72bn during 1993-94, through its refining and marketing
operations, up 14 per cent from last year.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Japan offers war atonement scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan took a further sign-ificant step yesterday in its efforts to atone for
second world war aggression with a pledge to spend Y100bn (Pounds 656m) on
historical research and cultural projects to promote peace in Asia.
'It is imperative for us Japanese to look squarely to our history with the
peoples of neighbouring Asia and elsewhere,' said Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the
prime minister, who yesterday unveiled the 10-year programme, beginning next
year, the 50th anniversary of the end of the war.
However, a foreign ministry official emphasised that the handout marked no
change in the policy of refusing further official government compensation
for individual war victims and their families. Japan argues that this was
formally settled by the 1951 San Francisco peace treaty.
The new money is instead earmarked for the creation of a historical war
document centre in Japan, vocational training centres for women in
neighbouring Asian countries and youth exchange visits. 'We have no
intention of reopening war claims,' said the official.
As a result, Mr Murayama's scheme is unlikely to defuse continuing claims
from British and Dutch prisoners of war and Korean women forced into
prostitution by invading Japanese troops.
These claims are irritants to Japan's painstakingly slow attempt to raise
its profile in international affairs and to bolster relations with
increasingly valuable Asian neighbours. South-east Asia has formed Japan's
largest export destination for the past three years and is its fastest
growing investment location.
Three successive Japanese prime ministers over the past year have issued
various statements of regret and apology in a campaign to normalise
relations with Asia. Mr Murayama returned recently from a four-country Asian
tour, largely devoted to trying to atone for the past, during which he was
told by the Malaysian government that Japan should cease apologising.
The effect of Japan's apologies has been spoiled by outspoken lack of
contrition from Japan's right wing, including two cabinet ministers sacked
over the past six months for trying to justify Japan's wartime actions. In
contrast to Germany, Japan's national consensus against its wartime record
is shaky. Undeterred, Mr Murayama yesterday repeated apologies to women
forced into prostitution and reiterated 'profound remorse' for suffering
caused by Japan.
He also said the government aimed to settle 'as soon as possible' the plight
of Koreans stranded in the Russian island of Sakhalin after the war and
wages owed to Taiwanese soldiers in the Japanese army, two other constraints
on Japan's relations with its Asian neighbours.
The government estimates that 43,000 Koreans, used for hard labour by
Japanese forces, were left in Sakhalin when it reverted to Moscow's hands
after the war. It faces 2.4m claims from Taiwanese for savings and unpaid
wages worth Y600m at 1945 prices.

FT  01 SEP 94 / China scraps Patten's reform package: Beijing passes law to
disband Hong Kong's popularly elected assemblies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China's threat to disband popularly elected assemblies in Hong Kong was made
law yesterday when the National People's Congress, China's parliament,
empowered a yet-to-be-appointed group to establish a fresh political order
in Hong Kong after 1997.
The official Xinhua news agency said the standing committee of the NPC had
issued a 'legal regulation' to abolish Governor Chris Patten's reform
package. 'The last Legislative Council, city government, district government
and district board will be terminated on June 30,' Xinhua said.
Since October 1992, when Mr Patten unveiled his plans for political reform,
China has repeatedly threatened to reverse them on regaining sovereignty on
July 1, 1997. The decision of the NPC, which was expected, puts beyond
question Beijing's determination to do just that.
The Hong Kong government's spokesman said that electoral arrangements,
approved by Hong Kong's Legislative Council (LegCo) earlier this year,
provided the best means for developing 'mature institutions' consistent both
with what has been agreed with China in the past and with the aspirations of
Hong Kong people themselves.
'It is not immediately apparent how dismantling representative institutions
which have been openly and fairly elected can be conducive to smooth
transition,' he said.
Xinhua said a preparatory committee, due to come into existence during 1996,
has been given responsibility for matters relating to setting up the first
post-colonial government and for forming its first legislature. The
preparatory committee will consist of mainland officials and Hong Kong
representatives.
The NPC's action in altering the preparatory committee's terms of reference
constitutes an amendment of the Basic Law for Hong Kong, passed in 1990.
Throughout months of talks with Britain about Mr Patten's political reforms,
China maintained that the Basic Law could not be amended.
Hong Kong's first fully democratic elections will be held later this month
when voters participate in elections for the colony's 18 district boards, or
local councils. Hong Kong is decked with posters proclaiming the virtues of
Liberal, Democrat and pro-Communist candidates.
Ms Marian Elsden, a consultant to the conservative Liberal Party, said
yesterday that most participating in the elections had accepted that there
would be a change in 1997 when China takes over. 'They are an amazingly
pragmatic people,' she said. 'There is also a feeling that there will be a
compromise after 1997.'
Be that as it may, it is clear from the NPC's decision that the Chinese
government has no intention of making life any easier for Mr Patten and the
British in Hong Kong.
The optimism which surrounded the Anglo-Chinese agreement on military lands
in June has given way to caution as talks about the colony's new airport and
a container port development drag on.
On the airport, talks appear to have stalled because Beijing is not prepared
to sign a detailed agreement, preferring instead a general statement of
support for the project. The Hong Kong government claims that lenders to the
project will want to know if China approves of the financial agreements
between the Hong Kong government and the two public corporations responsible
for the airport and its connecting railway.
If this were not enough for Mr Patten, who returned to Hong Kong from a
European holiday on Monday, he also has a number of other issues to contend
with.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption is conducting an investigation
into alleged corrupt practices at a recent land auction. If the commission
should recommend prosecution, the government will face the unpalatable
choice of charging some of the colony's leading businessmen or ducking the
advice and reducing Mr Patten's advocacy of the rule of law to empty
rhetoric.
The governor is also facing the prospect of a rift between his office and
the civil service, the 180,000-strong body which keeps Hong Kong functioning
in an efficient manner.
Mr Patten has been at odds with Mrs Anson Chan, chief secretary, over a law
banning discrimination against women and school textbooks' accounts of the
1989 Tiananmen massacre in Beijing. On both occasions Mrs Chan sided with
officials who sought to adopt a more permissive tone.
Observers in Hong Kong expect the gulf between UK and local officials to
grow over the next three years as local Chinese officials adjust to the
prospects of Chinese rule in the colony.
There is growing antagonism to Caucasians within the bureaucracy. A senior
member of Mr Patten's own staff has been unable to move from Government
House to another post within the senior civil service, partly due to his
links with the governor and partly because he is not Chinese.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Banks' financial secrets to be revealed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Much of the secrecy surrounding banks' financial statements in Hong Kong is
to be abolished, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) said yesterday,
writes Simon Holberton.
The changes, which were welcomed by Hong Kong's investment community, mean
that for the first time investors will know the true profits made by banks
in the colony. In the past banks have been able to disguise their true
position by transfers to or from secret balance sheet reserves.
The authority said banks with accounting periods ending on or after December
31 this year will be required to disclose all transfers to and from these
reserves. In addition, banks will be required to provide much more detail
about the structure of their loans and deposits than they have been required
to do. This will make it easier to understand the structure of bank balance
sheets.
The HKMA said the colony's banks will be able to keep secret the amount they
have already salted away in inner reserves, but by disclosing the amount of
the transfer to or from reserves, analysts will be able to infer the true
profit position of banks.
The authority said it would review its policy on disclosure of inner
reserves in mid-1995.
The Hong Kong stock exchange's listing rules will be amended to make
compliance with the disclosure provisions mandatory for listed banks.
To date, only HSBC Holdings and its listed subsidiary Hang Seng Bank, fully
disclose their financial position.
Mr Herbert Hui, a stock exchange executive director, said the changes to
banks' reporting would enhance considerably the transparency of local bank
reporting.
Mrs Laura Cha, an executive director of the Securities and Futures
Commission, Hong Kong's corporate watchdog, said the level of disclosure to
be required exceeded that originally proposed by the stock exchange and SFC.

Australia's annual growth rate dipped back to 4.3 per cent during the June
quarter, after reaching 5 per cent during the first three months of the
year, Nikki Tait reports from Sydney. However, the new figure was in line
with market expectations, and Mr Ralph Willis, the federal treasurer, said
the government saw no need to adjust its recent budget forecasts.

A treaty banning all nuclear tests is unlikely to be completed by next April
when the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) comes up for renewal,
Frances Williams reports from Geneva. Mr Miguel Marin-Bosch of Mexico, who
chairs the test ban treaty negotiations in Geneva, said yesterday it would
take 'a minor miracle' to finish the pact by then, though it might be
possible to have an 'almost agreed' text next spring.
A number of developing countries have said their position on extending the
NPT will depend on progress in the talks on a comprehensive test ban treaty
which began last January under the auspices of the United Nations
Disarmament Conference.

Japan's Science and Technology Agency (STA) lost its Y41.5bn (Pounds 270m)
experimental satellite yesterday as engineers abandoned attempts to
manoeuvre it into orbit following engine problems, Emiko Terazono reports
from Tokyo.
The loss of the satellite, launched to conduct tests on communication, has
caused deep embarrassment among officials of the STA and the National Space
Development Agency (Nasda). Its launch last Sunday marked Japan's first solo
development of a two-ton class geo-stationary satellite and Japan had hoped
to join the world's leading space powers with its success.
Mr Masato Yamano, president of Nasda, apologised to the public yesterday for
the failure. The programme had cost the government Y60bn, with the H-2
rocket, which launched the satellite, worth Y19bn.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Building boost for Japanese economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Evidence of a modest recovery in Japanese domestic demand emerged yesterday
in the form of an optimistic official forecast for industrial output and
good construction industry figures.
Industrial output, representing just under a third of the economy, fell by
1.7 per cent from June to July, but manufacturing probably perked up again
by 1.6 per cent in August, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry
said. Overall production in the year to July was all but stagnant, with a
0.6 per cent decline.
Production has wavered all this year (it rose by 2.7 per cent in June) as
the economy has bumped along in the early stage of a weak recovery. But Miti
believes the latest result confirms a general trend for output to
strengthen.
That view was supported yesterday by a 17.8 per cent rise in orders received
by Japan's top 50 construction groups in the year to July, the first such
jump in 18 months.
An encouraging feature was a 24.1 per cent rise in private sector orders,
two-thirds of the total, showing that the industry is becoming less
dependent on public works, a one-off boost financed by previous governments'
economic stimulation packages. Public sector orders grew 12.1 per cent over
the same period.
Separately, housing starts grew 5.8 per cent in the year to July, the fourth
monthly rise running, and confirmation of a recovery in unit sales, though
not prices, in the market for condominiums.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Groups join up to speed 'super-highway'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Forty-five Japanese companies have joined forces to commercialise plastic
optic fibre that would make laying the country's information super-highway
more practical and dramatically reduce its cost. The move could speed
Japan's entry into the multi-media age.
The consortium, which includes Mitsubishi Rayon, the world's largest
producer of plastic optical fibres, NEC, Fujitsu, and NTT, aims to
commercialise high-quality plastic optic fibre (POS) developed by Mr
Yasuhiro Koike, an assistant professor of applied science at Keio
University.
The optical fibre at present in use for communications purposes is made of
glass. The problem is that connecting different strands of glass fibre is
difficult, making the connectors used for that purpose highly expensive,
according to Mitsubishi Rayon.
Plastic optical fibre, on the other hand, is easily connected, reducing the
cost of connecting fibres from as much as Y30,000 (Pounds 194) for each
connection to as little as Y10.
It had been thought that plastic fibre, because of its limited transmission
capacity, was unsuitable for multi-media services, which call for the
transmission of huge amounts of data. The new plastic optical fibre
developed by Mr Koike has been able to overcome this shortcoming and is
capable of transmitting from one to more than 2.5 gigabits of information
per second, or equivalent to the amount required to send several television
channels down one multi-media line.
Mitsubishi Rayon expects plastic optical fibre to serve different needs from
glass optical fibre, which is likely still to be used for main trunk lines.
Development of the improved plastic optical fibre has attracted US
companies, with Boeing expressing interest in licensing the technology.
News of the development supported a strong rise in the share prices of
companies involved. Mitsubishi Rayon, for example, enjoyed an 11 per cent
increase on the day to Y472 in active trading. NEC rose Y10 to Y1,220.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Philippine first-half economic growth rate doubles to 5.1%
</HEADLINE>

The Philippines economy grew 5.1 per cent in the first half of this year,
more than double the 2.3 per cent growth in the same period last year,
according to government data released yesterday.
The performance puts the economy on track for its target of 4.5 per cent
overall growth for the whole of 1994, government economic managers said.
Behind the first-half expansion, according to the state policy-making
National Economic and Development Authority (Neda), was the stable
electric-power supply and favourable weather conditions during the period.
In the previous couple of years, the economy had stagnated because power
supply shortages had caused daily power cuts that crippled manufacturing
activities. Agriculture, on the other hand, was badly hit by typhoons and
drought.
Gross domestic product in the first half rose 4.1 per cent, but the
ever-increasing flow of remittances from Filipinos employed abroad continued
to bolster the overall gross national product, the Neda data showed.
Power-related activity and construction were the growth leaders during the
period, rising 14.5 per cent and 10 per cent respectively.
The government, in an effort to bring greater stability to power supply, has
been commissioning several private groups to construct power stations.
The manufacturing sector, on the other hand, advanced 5 per cent, a
turnaround from the decline of 3.1 per cent in the same period last year,
when the power cuts were at their worst.
The trade sector was also vibrant. Exports expanded 18.2 per cent, but
imports rose 22.2 per cent. Neda officials said the bulk of the imports were
capital goods (industrial equipment and machinery), which could lead to
further industrial growth in the coming months.

FT  01 SEP 94 / PNG discerns some light amid the gloom: Search for peace
will be right at the top of new premier's priorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Sir Julius Chan, Papua New Guinea's new prime minister took over the
leadership reins with relative ease.
From here on, however, life for the Chan regime may not be so easy. Sir
Julius, Papua New Guinea prime minister for a brief two years in the early
1980s, and its first finance minister after independence in 1975, faces
three main issues.
The first is the situation on the island of Bougainville, where the
government has been fighting a guerrilla war with local secessionists for
more than five years. The tactics of both sides have been condemned by
organisations such as Amnesty International, and international censure has
rained down.
There are, however, some hopeful signs. Private contacts between the
government and the Bougainville Revolutionary Army have been getting under
way in recent months, and Sir Julius, in his former role of foreign
minister, had been due to fly to Honiara, in the Solomon Islands, later this
week to meet secessionist leaders.
He quickly confirmed that this visit will go ahead. 'Peace is vital: it's
very much top of the priority list,' Sir Julius said, although he was less
precise about concessions which might be offered to the secessionists.
The second, even more intractable, problem is the economy, which suffered a
serious blow in 1989, when the Bougainville dispute forced the island's
large Panguna copper mine, operated by Australia's CRA, to close. The mine
had been providing about 30 per cent of the country's export earnings, and
accounted for some 10 per cent of its gross domestic product.
At first, PNG seemed to weather the Panguna loss fairly well. Gross domestic
product fell from Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.3bn) in 1989, to Dollars 3.2bn the
following year, but growth then picked up as the Porgera goldmine and Kutubu
oil field projects came on stream. It ran at double-digit rates in 1992 and
1993.
However, despite efforts to reduce public spending in line with diminished
means, the budget deficit mounted to dangerous levels in the early 1990s,
with actual government expenditure outstripping budgeted sums by significant
margins. The government deficit, which had stood at only 1.2 per cent of GDP
in 1989, rose to 5.6 per cent of GDP in 1992, and 7 per cent last year,
according to the latest Asia-Pacific Economics Group report.
With growth likely to evaporate in 1994 as the Porgera and Kutubu
contributions ease off, Mr Masket Iangalio, finance minister in the
government of Mr Paias Wingti, had warned that his country could be heading
for bankruptcy.
The third issue of pressing interest to western markets, and closely related
to the country's economic situation, is the country's resources policy. This
has been the focus of much confusion recently, with Mr Iangalio at open odds
with Mr John Kaputin, the former mining minister.
The fiercest tussle has come over the proposed ADollars 1bn (Pounds
487m)-plus gold mine on the island of Lihir, which is a joint venture
between Britain's RTZ and Niugini Mining, controlled by Canada's Battle
Mountain. The original plan was split funding between a ADollars 400m share
issue and debt financing, with the two partners and the Papua New Guinea
government all holding stakes in the project.
Since then, there has been furious debate over whether the PNG government
should stick to a provisional agreement to involve Malaysia's state-owned
Malaysia Mining Corporation at an early stage in return for assistance with
funding, and what equity entitlements should be offered to landowners.
The required 'special mining lease', due to be granted in early 1994, has
still not materialised.
In Australia, mining executives seemed to be holding their breath and hoping
that the change of government will mean a more pragmatic approach to Papua
New Guinea's economic difficulties, and thus a smoother ride for would-be
project developers.
One, involved with the Lihir project, suggested Sir Julius would probably
want to put his own stamp on the mine decision, but would appreciate the
economic boost it could eventually bring. 'I don't think they can afford not
to go ahead,' he said.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Fears of violence stalk Cairo conference: Population
delegates are putting themselves in danger's way, militants warn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The glee with which the Egyptian government originally greeted the UN's
selection of Cairo as host to next week's International Conference on
Population and Development looks increasingly tinged with apprehension, as
the hordes of delegates, journalists and assorted experts start to arrive.
After two years' hitting the headlines for Islamic militant violence,
publicity which devastated its glittering tourism industry, Egypt was able
to point proudly to the conference as evidence of the highest confidence in
its control of domestic security. The prestige of the gathering was also
taken as acknowledgment of Egypt's central role in the Middle East and
Moslem world.
But as Monday's official opening of the conference nears, its hosts have
reason to feel anxious.
Not only has the violent and militant Gamaa al-Islamiyya re-emerged after
several months' relative silence to warn visitors that they 'are putting
themselves in danger's way' by attending, but the debate about the
conference's agenda has suddenly reared into an awkward religious battle
which seems to have caused one of Egypt's staunchest regional allies, Saudi
Arabia, to boycott the affair altogether.
It has put Cairo firmly on the defensive in its domestic political tussle
with Islamic conservatives.
The government has bent every bone to assure the greatest possible security
for the conference, which will attract 15,000 delegates, with an assortment
of prime ministers, vice-presidents and celebrities.
The capital's main routes are dotted with white-uniformed police, and
parking has been banned around the main hotels, which resemble minor
military encampments.
Until a week ago, the Cairo government could claim with some confidence that
it had won the upper hand in its assault on violent Islamic extremists.
Although violence continued in militant hotbeds around Assiut in Upper
Egypt, Gamaa al-Islamiyya had failed to pull off attacks on tourist targets
for almost five months, its flow of faxed warnings had abated and the
capital had for months been free of even minor incidents.
But last Friday, Gamaa re-surfaced to claim credit for an attack on a group
of Spanish tourists in Upper Egypt in which a young Spaniard was killed.
Last weekend it condemned what it called the 'conference on licentiousness'
and made its warning to attending delegates.
The result has been to remind the government, and all those attending the
conference, that however successful the government has been in constraining
militant violence, it has failed to eliminate it.
Few diplomats or other observers in Cairo would therefore pronounce with any
confidence that the next 10 days will pass without a single incident. 'It is
an enormous test,' says a western diplomat. 'The militants will know that
the smallest incident over the next few days will get them big headlines.'
But the headlines surrounding the conference to date have already been
discomfiting enough for the government.
That the conference's proposed final text has become the focus of a furious
battle between Roman Catholic and Moslem conservatives and the majority of
the other 170 states represented at the meeting, who have been working on
the draft for some two years, is embarrassing enough.
It has already led to the boycotts by Saudi Arabia and Sudan, and is likely
to have been a factor in the decisions of Turkey's Premier Tancu Ciller and
Ms Begum Khaleda Zia, Bangladesh's prime minister, not to attend.
Worse, for the government, however, is the ammunition the row over the draft
text has handed Egypt's religious conservatives, particularly the Moslem
Brotherhood, to which President Hosni Mubarak's regime vehemently denies
status as a political party.
The regime has done all it can in recent months to counter the Brotherhood's
increasingly successful infiltration of powerful professional associations,
such as the lawyers' and doctors' syndicates.
The government is suspicious of the Brotherhood's position in relation to
extremist and violent militant groups, despite the Brotherhood's constant
assertion of its moderation.
It recently excluded the Brotherhood from a national political dialogue,
saying it did not exist as a political group. It has done all it can to try
to diminish the Brotherhood's religious and political authority, in favour
of its own state-sanctioned Islamic voice, which has traditionally issued
from the Al-Azhar University mosque, one of Islam's oldest seats of
instruction.
But the Al-Azhar earlier this month handed the government an unpleasant
surprise by condemning the conference as un-Islamic. It accused the draft
text of condoning homosexuality, abortion and pre-marital and adolescent
sex. The Brotherhood promptly agreed with the condemnation, branding the
conference an imperialist attempt by the west to curb population growth in
the Moslem world.
That the row over the draft text has handed the Brotherhood a powerful
political platform is clear from the fact that the government has been
forced to reply, defensively, that it could not condone anything in the
final document which ran contrary to Sharia, or Islamic, law.
'The government cannot oppose the Brotherhood,' says Mr Essam al-Arian, a
doctor and Brotherhood spokesman, 'because society feels we are moderate and
active. They have no choice but to have full dialogue with us.'
The full political consequence of this row for the government, and the
implications for its own population policies will take much longer than the
conference to shake out. Leaders of the Brotherhood have their eyes firmly
on next year's party elections, which they are likely to contest in informal
alliance with the Labour Party.
Meanwhile, the conference hosts can only hope at least for another
incident-free fortnight in Cairo, one which might help to restore the city's
currently fully booked hotels to their former profitability.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Birth-rate successes moderate Iran's stance: A look at
attempts to rein in alarming fertility rates as population hits 60m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU

<TEXT>
The Iranian government's opposition to next week's United Nations population
conference is not so great that it will join Saudi Arabia and Sudan in
boycotting it.
Iran is sending a delegation which it hopes will 'adapt the final document
to incorporate religious ethics'.
Criticism of the Cairo conference centres on the pragmatic approach taken
towards issues such as extramarital and adolescent sex.
Mr Ali Reza Marandi, Iran's health minister, said earlier this week, that
the draft document 'seemed to have disregarded the religious views of the
Islamic world and formulated the text with a sense of sexual liberty'.
Iran's own religious ethics underwent revision toward population control in
1988, when the government recognised the severity of the country's high
population growth rate.
The average population growth rate of 3.9 per cent a year in the early 1980s
was among the highest in the world. The Islamic government, which took over
after the 1979 revolution, laid greater emphasis than before on early
marriage and the woman's role as wife and mother and saw no reason to
encourage birth control.
It welcomed the growth in population, seeing it in terms of increased
resources to build the country into an Islamic model. By the mid-80s,
however, concerns about the economy led to fears that the high population
growth was a threat rather than an aid to economic development.
Iran's population grew from just over 37m at the beginning of the revolution
in 1979 to 57m by 1986, an increase attributed to the lack of a family
planning programme combined with improved health care since the 1960s.
Today, Iran's population is believed to stand at more than 60m.
Implementation of a family planning programme in 1988 has witnessed a drop
in the annual average growth rate from the 3.9 per cent peak to 2.3 per cent
last year and down further to 1.8 per cent in July, according to government
figures. Demographic experts, while acknowledging that Iran has been
successful in controlling its population growth, are sceptical of these
figures. They argue that such a rapid population decrease is impossible in
such a short period of time and cite the need for strengthened data
collection and statistical analysis.
The most reliable figures are those of the country's census, taken every
five years. This showed an annual average growth rate of 2.9 per cent in
1991, well above the current 2 per cent growth rate for developing
countries. Subsequent figures have been based on less reliable samples.
Mr Shu Yun Xu, Iran country director at the United Nations Population Fund
(UNFPA), says that despite the controversial figures, Iran's family planning
programme has been 'a great achievement', partly because of the strength of
the government's commitment. 'It has been supportive of all contraceptive
methods, including male sterilisation. Only abortion is not allowed.'
In June, the UNFPA approved a Dollars 10m five-year country programme for
Iran and part of the funds are allocated to improving Iran's demographic
data collection.
The main thrust of the government's population control programme has been
based on an increased supply of contraceptives, the training of rural
midwives and counselling in family planning techniques. The Ministry of
Health, which established a Fertility Regulation Council in 1988 to
implement the programme, reports a decline in total fertility from 6.4
children per woman in 1988 to 4.25 in 1993.
Increase use of contraceptives has been partly fuelled by the lack of family
planning services for almost a decade. An active family planning programme
was launched under the Shah's regime, so the implementation of the current
programme has been relatively easy given the public's existing awareness.
Another reason for the success of the family planning programme has been a
relatively good health infrastructure which, according to UNFPA reaches 60
per cent of those living in the countryside and 90 per cent of the majority
urban population.
Mr Xu said: 'The primary healthcare network is very good especially in rural
areas and the infrastructure is much better than for many Asian countries.'
A women's health volunteer programme in the poor suburbs of southern Tehran
has so far produced good results and is to be extended. Under the programme,
women volunteers act as family planning counsellors in areas which are not
served by the primary healthcare network.
Iran has a relatively high literacy rate of 74 per cent and girls' enrolment
in primary school is nearly as high as that of boys. The spread of education
and literacy has increased a widespread desire for smaller families.
Despite the success of the programme to date, the UNFPA says the tasks ahead
are still 'formidable'. A relatively large number of Iranians, born in the
baby-boom of 1976-1986 will be of child-bearing age from 1996 onwards, so
fertility rates will increase.
Since 65 per cent of the population is under the age of 25, there is a need
for even more emphasis to be placed on education.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Sri Lanka to investigate 'three business deals'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MERVYN DE SILVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sri Lanka's new government will investigate three multi-million dollar
business deals set up by the country's previous rulers, Mrs Chandrika
Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, the newly-elected prime minister, said yesterday.
The deals, a Dollars 73m (Pounds 48.6m) arms agreement with Russia, the
purchase of three Airbus jetliners, and the import of 5,000 buses from India
and Britain, would be investigated by the Finance Ministry, she added.
'In the arms deal, 10 per cent has been paid in an unconventional manner
without following procedure,' she alleged.
According to a report by the army's Directorate of Electrical and Mechanical
Engineers, obtained by Reuters this week, a consignment of eight BMP-2
infantry fighting vehicles also had defective engines and steering systems,
despite Russian assurances the vehicles would be fully overhauled and
defects repaired.
A second cargo of eight BMP-2s arrived last week and is waiting at Colombo
airport, army officials said.
They were part of a controversial arms deal with Russia, now suspended by
the government, for 200 armoured vehicles, gunboats, helicopters and
transport aircraft, for use in an offensive against Tamil guerrillas
fighting for independence in the island's north and east.
Mrs Kumaratunga said Airbus Industrie had agreed to a 10-day grace period to
sign an agreement, earlier scheduled for last Monday for the delivery of
three A340-300 jetliners.
'We are studying the agreement,' she added.
Mr Dharmasiri Senanayake, Aviation Minister, said the Dollars 300m Airbus
contract, criticised by the People's Alliance when it was in opposition as
being too extravagant, would not be cancelled because of international
obligations.
Officials of the People's Alliance coalition, which won the August 16
national poll, have accused unnamed officials of receiving 'commissions'.
Mrs Kumaratunga said the treasury had overspent Rs33bn (Pounds 433m) under
the former United National Party government which ruled for 17 years.
'Because of this deficit, the Central Bank was about to print money. I had
to stop that.' The Prime Minister, who is also the finance minister, said
she was looking at ways of bridging the gap.

Only 7 per cent of the 14m businesses in the European Union have more than
nine employees, according to a study by the EU's statistical office,
Eurostat. Enterprises with fewer than nine employees account for around a
third of EU employment and a quarter of the EU's Ecu10,500bn (Pounds
8,368bn) annual turnover. Small businesses are particularly important in
Italy and Spain where they form the backbone of the economy. In Germany,
France and Britain larger companies have a bigger share of employment. Only
slightly more than 15 per cent of the Spanish workforce is employed in
companies with 500 people or more, against 36 per cent in Germany. The
survey, based on 1990 figures, which are the latest available, also show
that the four largest economies in the EU - those of Germany, the UK, France
and Italy - account for 67 per cent of the 14m EU enterprises, and for 75
per cent of the 92m people employed in the EU.

<TEXT>
Further evidence of France's economic recovery emerged yesterday with the
news that the level of unemployment fell slightly in July for the second
month in succession. The number of people out of work in July fell by
10,800, or 0.3 per cent from June, with the overall jobless total reaching
12.6 per cent, or 3.22m people, against 12.7 per cent for May. Rising
unemployment has for the past four years been one of the toughest problems
facing France. The socialist government's failure to address the issue was a
key factor behind its defeat in last year's parliamentary election and the
recent reduction in the jobless figures has helped boost the popularity of
Mr Edouard Balladur's centre-right administration this summer. Economists
anticipate further reductions in the unemployment figures during the autumn
and winter, albeit at a gradual pace, given that the rate of growth is
expected to slow.

<TEXT>
Most Germans do not believe a campaign pledge by the opposition leader, Mr
Rudolf Scharping, to reject any pact with ex-communists after the October 16
general election, an opinion poll released yesterday showed. The poll, by
the Allensbach Institute, indicated that 54 per cent of those surveyed said
Mr Scharping, leader of the Social Democrats (SPD), would accept the support
of ex-communists if it was needed to become chancellor. Twenty-five per cent
said they believed Mr Scharping, who insists he would reject any backing
from the ex-communists when a new parliament convenes. The remaining 21 per
cent were undecided, according to the poll, published in the Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung. Even among SPD members, only 40 per cent believed Mr
Scharping, while 38 per cent doubted his word and 22 per cent did not answer
either way. The issue has dominated campaigning since the SPD in the eastern
state of Saxony-Anhalt last month formed a minority state government based
on tacit toleration from the Party of Democratic Socialism, the successor to
East Germany's ruling Communist party.

The Dutch prime minister, Mr Wim Kok, yesterday promised 'work, work and
more work' from his new coalition government to tackle rising crime, build
prosperity and launch a review of foreign policy. Presenting his government
programme to the Dutch parliament, Mr Kok responded to criticism that his
new coalition, which excludes the Christian Democrats and joins the Labour,
conservative Liberal, and reformist D66 parties, would prove fragile. The
coalition has been dubbed 'purple' because of the mix of the three parties'
political colours. The government took 111 days to form after an
inconclusive general election in May.
Mr Kok, former finance minister, inherits a sound economy emerging from a
mild recession. As part of a modestly austere financial package, he has
pledged funds to stimulate new jobs, financed by spending cuts. Mr Kok
warned that the cuts, aimed at health care, state pensions, higher education
and child benefit, would mean 'some painful measures'. Foreign policy will
be reviewed within two years, with a new emphasis on linking it to
development co-operation.

The American UN envoy, Ms Madeleine Albright, said yesterday that Washington
was anxious to ensure that Russian troops leave Moldova and it was ready to
act to encourage them to do so. Russia's 14th Army has been deployed in the
breakaway Dnestr region of Moldova since Moldovan independence in 1991.
Earlier this month, Russia and Moldova finalised an agreement which
stipulated the withdrawal of the 14th Army within three years. It is
awaiting the approval of the Russian and Moldovan presidents, Mr Boris
Yeltsin and Mr Mircea Snegur. Ms Albright said she had discussed the issue
with Mr Snegur and the Moldovan foreign minister, Mr Mihai Popov. 'We were
discussing how the international community can be helpful in observing the
departure of the 14th Army and what international approaches can help to
keep the pressure on in order to make the army leave,' she said.
She said that, when in Moscow, she would urge Russian leaders to act without
delay in withdrawing their forces from Moldova and other former Soviet
republics. 'This is not only good for the republics themselves, such as
Moldova, but also for Moscow in order to have peace on its borders and in
its former republics,' she said. Moldova is the only former Soviet republic
where Moscow keeps its forces without a formal agreement on military bases
or any other accord. Russia has signed such treaties with the Transcaucasian
states of Georgia and Armenia as well as with the Central Asian republic of
Tajikistan.

FT  01 SEP 94 / European Profile: German in EU hierarchy - Helmut Kohl's
nominee moves into a top job in Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Dr Jurgen Trumpf is hardly a household name. But today in Brussels, Mr
Trumpf, formerly the top civil servant at the German foreign ministry in
Bonn, moves into one of the most powerful jobs in the EU hierarchy.
The post of secretary-general of the European Council cannot compare with
the president of the European Commission, a job which Mr Jacques Delors has
transformed over the past 10 years into the public face of Europe. But its
attractions are no less real.
The selection of Mr Trumpf reveals much about the discreet manner in which
Germany prefers to wield influence in the EU; but it also reflects a shift
in the balance of power away from the Commission to the Council and the
European Parliament.
The secretary-general serves as chief adviser to the Council of Ministers,
the leading decision-making body in Brussels; and as counsellor to the
rotating EU presidency. Supported by a modest but slowly expanding
secretariat, he is also a high-level diplomatic intermediary between the
member states, particularly ahead of EU summits which set the broad
direction and policy of the Union every six months.
In this capacity, the secretary-general serves as the guardian of the EU's
institutional memory. He is charged with reminding member states of the
commitments and obligations which they have undertaken. Thus, what looks
like an innocuous bureaucratic function is, in fact, a powerful constraint
on the (often misplaced) ambitions of incoming EU presidencies and a
guarantor of continuity in EU policy- and decision-making.
Under Mr Niels Ersboll, Mr Trumpf's long-serving Danish predecessor, the
influence of the Council secretariat expanded. Its legal team - headed by Mr
Jean-Claude Piris - was instrumental in drawing up the compromise which
allowed Denmark to resubmit the Maastricht treaty to a second referendum
after voters had thrown out the first version in June 1992.
It also has a nascent foreign policy co-ordination unit headed by Mr Brian
Crowe, a senior British diplomat.
The question is whether the decline in influence of the Commission will
continue once Mr Delors hands over to Mr Jacques Santer, the outgoing prime
minister of Luxembourg.
Mr Trumpf, 63, a classical philologist by training, studied in Athens in the
mid-1950s. An avowed Anglophile, he entered the German foreign service in
1958 - the date when France, Germany, Benelux and Italy concluded the treaty
of Rome which created the (then) European Community. Coincidentally, Mr
Trumpf's career has been built on making the ideal of European integration a
reality. He has worked exclusively on EU affairs since 1970, latterly as EU
ambassador in Brussels.
Like many of his generation, Mr Trumpf shares Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
determination to bind Germany into an integrated Europe.
Though mild of manner and usually sporting a friendly smile, Mr Trumpf has a
stubborn streak when it comes to defending Germany's commitments to Europe.
He is a staunch advocate of European monetary union and the imperative of
the Franco-German alliance. He understands public opposition in Germany to
giving up the D-Mark, but insists that Germany sticks to its treaty
commitment.
The temporary crisis in Anglo-German relations in September 1992 caused by
the forced withdrawal of sterling from the Exchange Rate Mechanism pained
him. He was less than comfortable with the presentation of the Bundesbank's
case against a premature lowering of German interest rates.
During his five-year term, Mr Trumpf will deal with the 1996
inter-governmental conference, as well as preparations for future EU
membership for the east Europeans, Cyprus and Malta.
It is widely predicted that an expansion of the EU beyond its present
planned membership of 16 will require a further dilution of national
sovereignty, mainly through streamlined decision-making.
The appointment of Mr Trumpf followed pressure from Chancellor Kohl who made
it known in Brussels that Germany was under-represented at the highest
levels of the EU bureaucracy. Germany has also taken a close interest in the
development of the European Parliament, where Mr Klaus Hansch has just been
voted president.

Dutch second quarter gross domestic product rose a provisional 2.3 per cent
year-on-year, the Central Bureau of Statistics said yesterday. Analysts had
forecast a rise of about 1.9 per cent. Without the effect of an extra
working day in the period, growth in the second quarter would have risen
around 1.7 per cent from the same period in 1993, the CBS said. Corrected
for seasonal factors, GDP rose 1.1 per cent from the first quarter of 1994.
The growth in the most recent quarterly reporting period was led by
expansion of nearly 3 per cent in the private sector, the CBS said, while
public sector growth was measured at a more moderate 1.5 per cent. The value
of goods produced rose approximately 3 per cent. Stronger growth in the
construction sector, including activities abroad, in the second quarter
compensated for a decline in the first quarter.
Hungary's trade deficit widened to Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1bn) in the first
half of 1994, compared with Dollars 1.53bn in the same period last year, the
central bank said yesterday. The current account deficit was Dollars 1.96bn,
up from Dollars 1.83bn in the first half of 1993. The government devalued
the forint 8 per cent in August in an attempt to boost exports and keep the
trade deficit for the year below Dollars 3bn.
Greece's retail sales index rose 13 per cent year-on-year in May after a
21.4 per cent rise in April, the National Statistics Service said. The rise
exceeded the 11 per cent year-on-year increase in the consumer price index
in the same month.

The French authorities yesterday expelled to the African state of Burkina
Faso 20 of the 26 Algerians who have been detained at a military base for
nearly a month as part of the Balladur government's anti-terrorist
clampdown, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. Mr Charles Pasqua, the
pugilistic interior minister who last month orchestrated the detentions
after a radical Moslem group claimed responsibility for the assassination of
five French nationals in Algeria, said the expulsions should act as 'a
lesson to anyone who doesn't respect the laws of the land'.
The Interior Ministry declined to comment on what would happen to the six
Algerians still being held under heavy guard at the disused army barracks in
the village of Follembray on the outskirts of Paris. However, Mr Said Magri,
a Lille pizza parlour owner who went on hunger strike after being interned
in early August, was yesterday allowed to return to his home.
Mr Pasqua came under fire from legal groups for sanctioning the original
internment of the Algerians and for yesterday's expulsions.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Unease inside Moslem Paris: How immigrants are coping with a
clampdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The heavy policing of areas of Paris inhabited by large numbers of Moslem
immigrants, following the killing of five French officials in Algiers last
month, appears so far to have been well received by French public opinion.
The policy, announced by Mr Charles Pasqua, the minister of the interior,
won the support of 71 per cent of respondents to one poll taken in
mid-August who said they trusted the government to 'avoid the risk of
terrorism'. Some 57 per cent agreed that repeated identity-checks by
security forces were 'efficient and dissuasive'.
Weeks after the killings, with newspapers carrying daily reports of further
violence and deaths in Algeria, the police are still out in force in the
north-African populated districts of larger towns, although the tension is
now easing. However, in such north-African strongholds as Barbes, near
Montmartre, shops close earlier and cafes are quieter than usual. Some
immigrants have even abandoned their customary Friday prayers at the local
mosque for fear of police spot-checks or being caught up in random trouble.
Older immigrants, mainly Algerians, fear that the worsening violence in
their country could spill over into terrorist acts in France. They remember
all too clearly that the Algerian war of independence was fought out in the
streets of French cities as well as in north Africa.
But they also fear growing racism encouraged by indiscriminate political and
media rhetoric. Mr Dalil Boubakeur, rector of the Paris mosque, has
expressed his concern that the 'fragile consensus' which has grown up in
recent years between many immigrants and French society is coming under
increasing strain.
The greater police activity has yielded what appears to be a very mixed bag
of alleged terrorists, reminiscent of a similar crackdown nearly a year ago
in response to the kidnapping of three consular officials in Algiers. One of
the two dozen Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) sympathisers detained at the
Follembray barracks, 100km north-east of Paris, is the activist, Mr Ahmed
Simozrag, who acted as lawyer for Mr Abassi Madani, the leader of the FIS
who has spent the last three years in an Algerian jail. Others are
self-proclaimed imams or run bookshops which stock FIS literature. Some had
weapons and considerable sums of money when picked up.
Critics of Mr Pasqua's policy argue that he does not differentiate between
the FIS, with its armed wing in Algeria, the Islamic Liberation Army (AIS)
which has condemned the killing of foreigners, and the hardline Islamic
Armed Group (GIA) which claims to be responsible for the deaths of the 59
foreigners killed over the past 12 months. As a result, they feel that the
minister is inviting reprisals on French residents in Algeria and tempting
the FIS to take its fight onto French territory.
Unlike Mr Alain Juppe, the minister of foreign affairs, who has called for a
dialogue between all parties to the conflict in Algeria, Mr Pasqua has given
his unstinting support to the military-backed regime. Mr Pasqua's
involvement with Algerian affairs can be traced back to the days when he
founded the Service d'Action Civique (SAC) to fight settlers who, between
1959 and 1962 had regrouped in the Organisation de l'Armee Secrete (OAS) to
fight General Charles de Gaulle's policy in Algeria.
Mr Pasqua's supporters argue that there is no such thing as a 'moderate'
fundamentalist. Ironically, since government-backed attempts in the
mid-1980s to integrate immigrant children in the poorer suburbs failed,
mayors of cities with large immigrant populations have often turned to imams
in the battle against crime and drugs.
Young unemployed Beurs, as French-born north Africans are called, found
solace in Islam and are proclaiming their Moslem faith in growing numbers.
Traders have erected signs which distinguish their outlets from other,
'non-Moslem' shops.
A sharp rise in the number of TV satellite dishes in north African suburbs
has allowed immigrants increasingly to tune in to non-French television
An estimated 3m Moslems live in France today, 500,000 of whom are French
citizens and the children of older immigrants. Of this total, 800,000 are
Algerian, 500,000 Moroccan and 200,000 Tunisian. It is more a patchwork of
groups than a homogeneous community, however, and the French authorities
remain extremely nervous at any sign of fundamentalism spreading.
But the real fear is based on the eventual outcome of the conflict in
Algeria. Should the fundamentalists come to power in Algeria before next
year's French election, Algeria and, by extension, the values propagated by
radical Islam, would take centre stage in the presidential campaign. That is
a prospect relished by few Frenchmen, other than right-wing supporters of Mr
Jean-Marie Le Pen, and even fewer immigrants.

vision of Europe's future

<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, the majority partner in
the ruling German coalition, will today unveil its strategy for the next big
reform step in the European Union - calling for the overhaul of all its
institutions, and formalisation of the idea of a multi-speed Community.
The plan seeks to limit the veto rights of individual member states over the
reform process, to boost the powers of the European Parliament to exercise
democratic control over the Council of Ministers and the European
Commission, and to reduce the Council itself to the role of a 'second
chamber' to the parliament.
It will call for reinforcement of a 'hard core' of the EU, and further
strengthening of the close relations between France and Germany as its
driving force.
The document will be presented today by Mr Wolfgang Schauble, leader of the
Christian Democrats (CDU) in the German Bundestag, and Mr Michael Gloss, his
counterpart in the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union, junior partner in
the coalition. Mr Schauble is the second most powerful man in the CDU after
Mr Kohl, and his blessing therefore gives the plan vital political backing.
Its presentation comes just two days after publication of an interview by Mr
Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, in which he spelt out a similar
vision of a multi-speed Europe.
It is clear that the political leaders in both Paris and Bonn have decided
that their ideas on the next phase of EU reform - the follow-up conference
to the Maastricht treaty scheduled for 1996 - must now be brought into the
open. That is in spite of the sensitivity of many of the issues involved,
given the looming referendums on EU membership in Finland, Norway and
Sweden.
In particular, the CDU is likely to touch on the issue of the voting weight
of different member states, suggesting that the most populous states should
have more votes - a highly contentious point for smaller member states,
including the new entrants.
However, the fact that both Mr Kohl's CDU and Mr Balladur are now giving
their open blessing to the concept of a multi-speed Community may ironically
make their vision of a 'federal' Europe easier for British Euro-sceptics to
swallow.
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, has already endorsed the idea in
principle.
In his interview with the newspaper Le Figaro, Mr Balladur said that
enlargement to include the newly emerging democracies of central and eastern
Europe would inevitably involve a degree of 'diversification' in the
structure of the EU, at least temporarily.
'For many years, no doubt, the European structure will involve a homogeneous
central core, consisting essentially of France and Germany, obeying common
rules in all areas of co-operation, with around it countries ruled by
differing laws, depending on whether they concern monetary matters, social
affairs, defence, trade relations, financial relations, or foreign policy,'
he said.
Mr Balladur is expected today to expand his proposals for the future
structure of the EU in a speech he will deliver at a formal lunch attended
by all France's ambassadors.
It is relatively rare for Mr Balladur to express such forthright views on
foreign policy which, under the French constitution, is generally regarded
as the preserve of the president, rather than the prime minister.
Mr Balladur has been particularly anxious to cast himself in a presidential
role in the approach to next spring's presidential elections. He is
currently well ahead of Mr Jacques Chirac, the powerful mayor of Paris, in
the opinion polls as favourite to win the centre-right candidacy.
Europe is one of the key foreign issues on which Mr Balladur and Mr Chirac
have traditionally disagreed: the Paris mayor being markedly more sceptical
about the merits of a unified Europe than the prime minister.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Bossi opens new wounds in coalition

<TEXT>
Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of Italy's populist Northern League, yesterday
reopened a damaging split in the Italian government by accusing Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, the prime minister, of trying to cut the League out of the
governing coalition.
An agitated Mr Bossi, interviewed on television as he returned from holiday
in Sardinia, also claimed that Mr Berlusconi had asked President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro for permission to hold new elections. The claim was immediately
dismissed by the prime minister and the president.
'I won't waste time denying nonsense,' Mr Berlusconi was reported as saying.
'I'll have to propose a tax on chatter.' The president's press office issued
a statement saying Mr Bossi's claim was 'absolutely without foundation'.
Mr Bossi's comments demonstrate, however, that three weeks' holiday has not
healed the rift between the League leader and his coalition allies.
'It's not possible to offload the League,' Mr Bossi said, pointing out that
it was the principal parliamentary party. 'At this point perhaps we ought to
give Berlusconi an abacus, if he goes on fooling himself that it's possible
to throw out the League before we've passed an anti-trust law or a new
constitution.'
Mr Gianfranco Fini, leader of the third main coalition partner, the
far-right National Alliance, said in a television interview that Mr Bossi's
behaviour was 'puerile'.
At the beginning of August, Mr Berlusconi and Mr Bossi held all-night
discussions to patch up their differences. The next day they appeared on
television together in an attempt to demonstrate to nervous financial
markets and the Italian people that there were no hard feelings between
them, in spite of Mr Bossi's persistent criticism of Mr Berlusconi.
Since then, Mr Bossi has kept up an informal commentary on League policy
from the beach in Sardinia, but has refrained from attacking Mr Berlusconi.
Mr Bossi's intervention could upset financial markets, just as they seemed
to have recovered their poise following the turbulence caused by political
uncertainty and the consequent rise in Italian interest rates last month.
Yesterday, before Mr Bossi's comments were broadcast, the lira strengthened
against the D-Mark and was trading at less than L1,000 for the first time
since August 8.
In recent days, Mr Bossi has been incensed by press reports that he claimed
to have prevented an armed rebellion by League supporters in 1986-87. He has
blamed 'anti-democratic' journalists for misreporting his comments, and has
threatened legal action against television and newspapers for spreading
'disinformation'.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Greeks clasp hands over the Albanian border: Religion and
language link local communities, but church is also fuelling discord between
two states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The morning church service is normally well attended in the two villages of
Dervistani and Konitsa. The Orthodox ritual of burning candles within a
gallery of saints, and the intoning priest with his beard and pony-tail,
give the villagers a strong sense of their Greek identity.
Their common beliefs and language appear to transcend the Albanian-Greek
border separating the two communities. But, like elsewhere in the Balkans,
the church is also an invisible hand which is fuelling tension between
Athens and Tirana over minority rights.
Dervistani and Konitsa are small Greek villages, one in southern Albania,
the other about 30km away in northern Greece. Both their economies are based
on agriculture, forestry and remittances from emigres, and both have famous
priests.
In Dervistani, Fr Michailis Dakos, 77, was the first to conduct a public
religious ceremony in Albania after 23 years of communist attempts to
eradicate religion. He is now vigorously campaigning to improve the rights
of the Greek minority in southern Albania. Two of his parishioners are among
the five on trial in Tirana accused of working with Greek intelligence to
encourage a secessionist movement in the south.
Like the Greek government, he thinks the trial is a set-up aimed at
discrediting ethnic Greek nationalism. His demands focus on better education
and cultural activities, but his agenda is one of ethnic independence.
'We want to see better treatment for the (100,000 or so ethnic) Greeks
living in Albania,' he says. 'We want our own education facilities, freedom
to teach our language and history, and closer co-operation with the mother
country (Greece).'
From Konitsa, Bishop Sebastianos Economidis, 74, is trying to do just that.
He runs a church-funded radio station called 'The Voice of Orthodox Greeks'
which, in the words of its manager, Mrs Michailidou Epicharis, is aimed at
'educating' the Greek community in south Albania. Every afternoon it
broadcasts Greek 'programmes of history and culture' which the Albanian
authorities have branded as 'dangerous propaganda'. The bishop has often
been accused of calling for a Greek invasion of south Albania to liberate
the minority, and during the court case in Tirana, the state prosecutor has
declared him persona non grata.
Priests and politics have become dangerously entwined in the southern
Balkans. Last year, Fr Dakos's friend and colleague, Fr Chrysostomos
Maidonis, was expelled by the Albanian authorities from Gjirokastra, the
main town in the south, for his political activities which resulted in
another wave of deportations of Albanians from Greece. As a result, many
ordinary Albanians have become suspicious of men who have taken the cloth.
In theory, Albania's 3.4m population is 70 per cent Moslem, 20 per cent
Orthodox, and 10 per cent Catholic. But as one ethnic Greek explained, the
country has never been fanatical in its beliefs, and between 1967 and 1990
it was formally atheist. 'Religion (in Albania) is imported,' he says. 'Most
of us are not religious at all and it is often used as a cover.'
With the fall of communism, the Greek Orthodox churches have taken on the
issue of minority rights and the question of secession for ethnic Greeks
with passion. They have adopted a particular version of history to support
their arguments which date as far back as the ancient kingdom of Epirus - an
area which included both Dervistani and Konitsa and where Pyrrhus had his
base in classical times - and to the London Conference on the Balkans in
1912 when the Great Powers gave Greece the area of Northern Epirus up to the
Shkumbi river, now in central Albania. Things started to go wrong, they say,
in Paris when in 1921 the Powers changed their minds and re-drew Albania as
it is today. And then came the second world war and communism.
'After all this, it's only natural that our people over there turn to us for
help,' explains Mrs Epicharis at the radio station in Konitsa.
While Greece continues to deport tens of thousands of non-Greek Albanians in
anger at the trial in Tirana, visas are readily granted to the minority
Greeks. Most of Dervistani's young men work in Greece and send remittances
home. Churches in Greece are financing the rehabilitation of Fr Dakos's
chapel which was used under the Communists as a fertiliser store. The people
of Konitsa and other towns send the Greek minority in Albania medical aid,
buses, and educational materials and are promoting commercial links by
exporting televisions, radios, refrigerators and importing hand-made
furniture and building stone.
The problem facing the still young but democratically elected government in
Albania is how far it can let these links develop. A close relationship is
one thing, but autonomy in the south could spell disaster. Growing tensions
between Athens and Tirana is already distracting them from the urgent need
to rebuild the country's economic and political structures. And the more
they clamp down on political activism, especially when it concerns the
church, the more the tension rises.
Mr Gentz Pollo, an adviser to Albania's President Sali Berisha, says: 'The
only way to resolve all this is through dialogue. Greece has so far rejected
this way and we can only hope they will change their minds.' While the
politicians refuse to talk, many Albanians fear the church's voice will grow
louder.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Spanish budget battle begins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Felipe Gonzalez's minority Socialist government yesterday began the
tortuous process of crafting an agreement on next year's budget with the
main Catalan nationalist coalition, cautious of giving too much away on home
rule and of irritating its own left wing with conservative policies.
The wary tone of the annual bout of horse-trading was underscored by Mr
Miquel Roca, the chief budget negotiator for Catalonia's Convergencia i Unio
(CiU) centre-right coalition, who said an initial meeting with Mr Pedro
Solbes, economy minister, had revealed 'areas of agreement and of
disagreement'.
Mr Solbes' 1995 budget, due before parliament not later than September 30,
requires the support of the 17 CiU deputies to pass through the legislature.
The Catalan coalition backed last year's budget, following the Socialists'
loss of their majority in the general election, after a concession allowing
regional governments to control 15 per cent of the income taxes raised in
their territories.
CiU, the main political grouping in wealthy Catalonia, also brought the
government round to spending cuts and to overhauling the rigid domestic
labour legislation. This year it has raised the stakes: it wants power
sharing between Madrid and the regional executives over the distribution of
European Union funds to Spain, and is seeking lower social security
contributions by employers, as well as further easing of hiring and firing
procedures.
Officials are concerned that the EU funds issue could be contested by other
regions and fuel claims that the CiU is bent on gaining advantages for
Catalan nationalism at the expense of the principle of national solidarity.
In Andalucia, Spain's most populous region where the Socialist party lost
its majority in local elections in June, opposition parties joined forces in
the regional parliament last month to reject the 15 per cent tax concession
in this year's budget. They claimed it favoured Catalonia over poorer
regions where fiscal revenues are much lower.
The Socialist party's left wing and the 18-strong Communist contingent in
the Madrid parliament are meanwhile certain to oppose both cuts in social
security contributions and increased deregulation of the labour laws.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Conoco joint venture starts to pump oil from Russian field:
Project is small but carries considerable symbolic importance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Polar Lights joint venture between Conoco and Archangelskgeologia, which
started producing oil in the virgin tundra of northern Russia yesterday, is
being hailed as a beacon of hope amid the gloom that shrouds the Russian oil
industry.
When the Soviet Union fell apart, Conoco was just one of droves of western
oil companies which came to Russia with high hopes of breaking into what was
the world's biggest crude oil and gas producer. Many other oilmen are now
heading home disillusioned with the legislative and bureaucratic
frustrations.
Conoco and Archangelskgeologia have succeeded where others have failed
largely through sheer persistence - and some useful political backing from
Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin. Their Ardalin field is the first
to be developed by a joint venture company and the partners hope to make a
good return on their Dollars 375m investment by selling the oil abroad.
Representatives of other western oil companies in Moscow suggest the
achievement should not be underestimated nor should the deal's symbolism be
ignored. But, they stress, it is important to set the deal in context: the
investment is relatively small; big risks remain.
By global industry standards, the Ardalin field, 1,000 miles northeast of
Moscow, is minuscule, with peak production of 25,000 barrels a day expected
by 1996. The exploration risks have also been slight. Russian geologists
discovered oil reserves in the Timan Pechora basin years ago but did not
exploit them as the central economic planners directed resources towards
western Siberia. Moreover, the field is relatively straightforward to
exploit despite being located in the Arctic Circle.
While proud at what has been achieved to date, the cheery Mr Constantine
Nicandros, Conoco's president and chief executive, is realistic about what
remains left to do. 'Ardalin is interesting but we would not have come to
Russia just to do this project. There are far bigger fields in the northern
area waiting to be developed. You could be looking at another Alaska, a
second Prudhoe Bay. Although there is not one individual field, the Timan
Pechora region could produce about 5bn-10bn barrels,' he says.
Conoco is studying projects which would require a further Dollars 5bn of
gross investment. Four other western companies, Amoco, Texaco and Exxon from
the US, and Norsk Hydro from Norway, have also been co-operating on
developing reserves in the the same Nenets region while Shell and Saga are
also aiming to develop other fields nearby. The companies are studying
whether it would be feasible to build an offshore terminal handling about
450,000 barrels a day at a cost of Dollars 2bn.
But before committing such sums, the companies say they need a change in
Russian tax and business legislation. 'Only when the legal system in this
country changes, such that we can operate with confidence, can we be
optimistic that we can develop this region,' says one consortium member.
Even the Ardalin field could fall victim to the ever-changing legislative
regime. The project's viability is dependent on the continuation of a
temporary energy ministry waiver, specifically for the project, of the
customary Dollars 5 a barrel export tax. Polar Lights also relies on a
precarious web of 10 interlocking contracts to sell oil abroad. Because
Polar Lights does not yet have a direct pipeline to the west, it is obliged
to swap its oil with other Russian producers with access to western markets.
'We all had doubts about this arrangement and those doubts remain. The
difficulties of getting oil to a western customer makes things very
complicated,' says Mr Anatoly Kazakov, general director of
Archangelskgeologia.
The lack of rouble convertibility and the artificially low price of oil
within Russia would ruin the project's economics if those export
arrangements broke down.
Russian nationalists are also hostile to granting production licences to
western companies. But the counter-argument is that Russia's economic
self-interest will prevail.
Mr Kazakov says his company and Russian federal and local governments will
receive 70 per cent of the Dollars 2bn income the Ardalin field is expected
to generate over the next 16 years. Without such income, he suggests, the
Russian government cannot afford to develop the industry by itself. Already
the government has delayed Rbs10bn (Pounds 3m at the market rate) of
payments to Archangelskgeologia, meaning many of its workers have not been
paid. 'The government should declare itself bankrupt,' Mr Kozakov says with
grim humour.
That may leave an opportunity for western companies. Mr Nicandros is
certainly convinced of the possibility. 'Russia is probably still the
biggest oil and gas producer in the world,' he says, 'and to ignore it means
you are not going to participate in a significant part of the global
business. There are risks. But you can analyse these things to death and it
will just be what it will be. All you can do is make your best judgment at
the time.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Slowly and without fanfare, a 20,000km motorway system linking the Baltic
Sea with the Aegean and the Black Sea with the Adriatic is taking shape in
eastern Europe.
If the planners' dreams come true, some day not too far distant cars and
trucks will be able to speed along a virtually seamless highway from Gdansk
to Gurbulak on Turkey's border with Iran and from Genoa to Constanta,
Romania's Black Sea port.
The network is already a quarter complete; a quarter is under construction.
Nearly 200km will be opened this year and a further 200km in 1995.
The Trans-European Motorway (TEM) is matched by a similar network of
designated international rail routes, the Trans-European Railway (TER),
aimed at developing a coherent and efficient rail and combined transport
system for eastern Europe.
Co-ordinating these grandiose schemes, conceived well before the collapse of
communism in 1989, is a reticent United Nations organisation, the Economic
Commission for Europe. The Geneva-based ECE, whose 54 members span western
and eastern Europe and North America, is responsible for 50-odd pan-European
transport conventions, perhaps the best known being the TIR international
lorry system.
Tackling the dreadful state of their transport infrastructure, and the
serious bottlenecks at western borders, has become an important priority for
the governments of central and eastern Europe. Success in moving towards a
market economy now depends on boosting exports, primarily to the west, while
the tearing down of the Iron Curtain has vastly increased the numbers of
people on the move.
Yet the region (excluding Russia) boasts just 5,000km of motorways, compared
with more than 40,000km in western Europe, and most of the remaining road
network is crumbling. Only a tiny fraction of rail lines meets standards
commonplace in the west. Many are in disrepair, and countries have different
technical and operating standards which make it difficult quickly to move
goods across frontiers.
The severe recession in most of central and eastern Europe that followed the
upheavals of 1989 led to big falls in traffic. But now that economic
activity is picking up, for instance in Poland and the Czech Republic, the
deficiencies of the creaking road and rail systems are becoming all too
apparent.
At the same time, says Mr Jose Capel Ferrer, head of the ECE's transport
division, the financial constraints on these countries are even tighter than
before. Though some help has been promised by the west, notably through the
European Union's Phare assistance programme, governments will have to find
the bulk of the resources to improve transport infrastructures themselves.
Partly in the hope of maximising western aid, and partly because of the need
to get priorities right, eastern European governments have assigned a
critical role to the TEM and TER projects. Both projects identify a 'core'
network of strategic modern transport links built and operated to common
standards, as well as a staged plan of action to put them in place.
The TEM, covering eight eastern European nations, was originally launched in
1977 as a north-south motorway axis. The plan was rapidly recast after 1989
to include an extra 7,000km of east-west connections to carry the big
increases expected in traffic volumes once economic recovery takes hold.
The short-term emphasis is now also less on building to full motorway
standard (costing Dollars 5m-Dollars 10m a kilometre), especially where
traffic levels do not yet justify it, and more on upgrading existing roads
or building one motorway carriageway (to take two-way traffic), leaving the
second for more prosperous times.
Financial constraints have propelled some countries to explore
build-operate-transfer (BOT) schemes in which private companies finance
construction and recompense themselves with tolls for a fixed period. With
the bulk of the motorway network in western Europe complete, French, Italian
and German companies are trawling hopefully for business in eastern Europe.
However, BOT plans have been bedevilled by arguments over terms, and
contractors themselves have sometimes been discouraged by current low
volumes of traffic.
Upgrading existing rail infrastructure and developing combined transport
installations, envisaged by the 1985 TER plan, is proving even more
difficult to fund than road-building. The 10 participant countries are now
concentrating on tackling the most urgent problems, for instance, by
relieving obvious bottlenecks.
The ECE is also laying stress not only on physical improvements to the rail
network but on the need to change management attitudes. In the days of
communism, long distance freight traffic was directed to the railways which
carried, on average, two-thirds of all tonne-kilometres (against less than a
fifth for western European countries).
Now, transport operators are free to use the roads which, even in their
degraded state, offer quicker door-to-door deliveries. The result has been a
dramatic decline in rail use.
To cope with the new situation, railway managers need to become more market
oriented, exploit combined transport possibilities (road, rail and water)
and simplify border procedures, the ECE says.

'I do need to know that violence hasended - that it isn't temporary' - John
Major
'John Major and the leaders of unionism should seize the moment' - Gerry
Adams
'An historic opportunity to take thegun out of Irish politics for ever' -
Albert Reynolds
The high-risk effort by the British and Irish governments to create a
lasting peace in Northern Ireland took a historic step forward at midnight
with the start of an open-ended IRA ceasefire.
The dramatic announcement that 25 years of violence, which has engulfed the
UK and several European countries, is to end with 'a complete cessation of
military operations' was warmly welcomed in Dublin and Washington, and more
hesitantly in London.
At the same time the IRA's failure to comply with British and Irish demands
to declare openly a permanent end to its armed campaign triggered an
immediate note of caution from Mr John Major, the British prime minister.
Mr Major, whose standing will be enhanced by an enduring peace, made clear
the government would not contemplate allowing Sinn Fein, the IRA's political
wing, into talks on Ulster's future until three months after it had become
clear that violence had been renounced for good.
'I don't mind how it is expressed. . . but I do need to know that violence
has ended for good and that it isn't a temporary ceasefire,' Mr Major said.
Dublin, however, did not share Downing Street's caution. Mr Albert Reynolds,
the Irish premier, said he accepted the bona fides of the IRA. 'As far as I
am concerned the war is over,' he said. 'There is now an historic
opportunity to take the gun out of Irish politics for ever and to achieve a
new and far-reaching political accommodation in a transformed atmosphere.'
Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, brushed aside Downing's Street's
reservations and called on Mr Major and unionist leaders to 'seize the
moment'. The IRA leadership had 'courageously created an unprecedented
opportunity which brings Anglo-Irish relations to a decisive point'.
Mr Adams indicated it was up to the British government to make the next
move. And he urged Britain to start the 'demilitarisation of the situation'
by releasing Irish nationalist prisoners and withdrawing troops from Ulster.
Republican sources were suggesting last night that, whatever London's view,
the ceasefire was intended to be permanent. It was not clear, however, how
or if this would be signalled.
The prime minister acknowledged that the IRA decision represented 'a great
step forward' but he moved to reassure unionists that there had been 'no
secret deals, no secret understandings'. He added: 'Northern Ireland is part
of the United Kingdom for so long as people in Northern Ireland wish to
remain part of the UK. They will do so with the support of this government
and I hope future governments.'
The IRA announcement comes nearly nine months after the British and Irish
governments signed the Downing Street declaration, which brought together
the two countries in an unprecedented attempt to establish common ground for
a political settlement in Ulster.
The declaration, made shortly before Christmas 1993, followed talks between
Mr Adams and Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly nationalist Social
Democratic and Labour party. Mr Hume said he believed the republican
movement wanted an end to the conflict which has claimed more than 3,000
lives in the last 25 years.
Since December, both governments have insisted that the republican movement
could be fully involved in the political process but only if it renounced
violence for at least three months.
Mr James Molyneaux, Ulster Unionist leader, echoed London's suspicions by
calling on the IRA to take the 'modest but very vital step' of confirming a
permanent end to violence.
In spite of the government's public hard line on the IRA's omission of the
word 'permanent' from its declaration, there were strong indications at
Westminster last night of an early lifting of the broadcasting ban on
representatives of Sinn Fein, including Mr Adams.
US president Bill Clinton, who described the IRA statement as a 'watershed
announcement', also called on the IRA to ensure that its violent campaign
ended permanently.
The US president yesterday spoke to both Mr Major and Mr Reynolds. Mr
Clinton made clear his government's intention to assemble an additional aid
package to help the peace process along.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said the British government
intended to stick to its three-month 'probation' period before talks could
begin on how to admit Sinn Fein to the political process.
'This is so important a matter that it ought not to be left at large or able
to be the subject of discussion and argument,' Sir Patrick added. He said it
was crucial that any future talks involving the IRA's political wing did not
take place under the implied threat that violence could resume.
Ministers will be hoping to avoid the threatened backlash by loyalist
extremists. There were no signs last night that the loyalists intended to
stop their campaign.
Shots were fired in three separate incidents in Belfast and County Fermanagh
shortly before the start of the ceasefire last night. There were no reports
of injuries.
Meanwhile, Ulster police were hunting a loyalist gang who murdered a
37-year-old Catholic after abducting him from a house in Antrim just hours
before the IRA's ceasefire declaration. The outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force
has claimed responsibility for the killing.

FT  01 SEP 94 / Joy turns to tension as Falls Rd hails peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A day of jubilation boiled over into tension in the Roman Catholic Falls
Road in Belfast last night as the IRA ceasefire came into effect.
Hundreds of people, who had spent the day celebrating the breakthrough, put
the nearby Springfield Road police station under virtual siege, waving
banners and the Irish tricolour.
As a police helicopter hovered overhead, and RUC vans converged on the
scene, one man scaled the 20 ft caging around the station to wave his flag
to the cheering crowds below.
The mood was a dramatic culmination to the euphoria that had been building
up among the crowds in the area during the day.
As the news of the ceasefire was first announced in the morning, one old
woman said to me delightedly: 'It would have been like this if we had won
the World Cup.'
She grabbed my arm and started to dance a jig. 'I've been waiting for this
for 25 years, and now we have got it we are going to have a party]' she
said.
As she spoke a procession of more than 50 cars, horns blaring, began to wend
its way up and down the road. Most carried Irish flags and Sinn Fein
posters. 'Brilliant, fantastic, any bloody word you like,' said George, one
of the drivers. 'They are the reason I'm so glad,' he added, pointing to his
two young children in the back of his car.
Outside Sinn Fein's headquarters the crowd shouted: 'We want Gerry, we want
Gerry]' Eventually the president of Sinn Fein appeared to loud cheers.
'I have got a bottle of champagne in one hand and a bunch of flowers in the
other,' Mr Adams said. 'What's happened to the ballot box and the rifle?' a
man whispered to me - although his appeared to be a lone protest.
But later in the afternoon, some along the Falls Road questioned the joy.
'This will not take me off the Protestant hit list, will it?' said Jim, the
21-year-old manager of a takeaway restaurant. 'The judge of whether this
means anything at all is whether I can start delivering food along the
Shankill,' he added.
'And I tell you, if I got a call to go up there tonight I wouldn't even
dream of it.'
Shaun, a taxi driver, warned that little had changed. 'Be very careful down
here - if one of our cheeky lads thinks you are a Prod there will be no
peace for you, whatever Mr Adams says,' he said.
'It really is up to Paisley and his people now.'
Along the Protestant Shankill Road there were few visible signs of optimism,
although people felt secure enough to give their full names.
Jim McBride, who has lived on the road for all of his 90 years, said the
ceasefire would be unlikely to change anything.
'The tit-for-tat killings will continue, neither side is going to lay down
its arms,' he said. 'It's too late for that now - there is too much at
stake. The IRA is running a business.'

FT  01 SEP 94 / BT cuts long-distance call prices by up to a quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications cut the price of long-distance calls within the
UK by up to a quarter yesterday, in a move likely to increase pressure on
its competitors in the business market.
The reductions, which will cost BT Pounds 244m over a full year, were made
within the terms of an agreement with Oftel, the telecoms regulator,
obliging BT to cut its charges by a total of about Pounds 500m in this
financial year. They take effect from September 29.
Oftel does not dictate the precise price cuts BT must make, only their total
value. The reductions are the latest in a series aimed by BT mainly at
business users, who account for a disproportionately large share of
long-distance calls.
Mercury and other new entrants in the business sector earn most of their
revenue by undercutting BT on long-distance call charges. In a clear
indication of its predicament, Mercury said yesterday it would be cutting
business prices 'shortly after' BT, but refused to say by how much.
Earlier this year Mercury briefly retained the morning peak rate for some
business customers after BT abolished it.
Yesterday's price cut involves abolishing the higher rate band for calls of
35 miles or more, which accounts for nearly three-quarters of all
long-distance calls made in the UK.
It follows a 20p reduction, to 25p, in the cost of calls to directory
inquiries, which takes effect today at a cost of Pounds 75m a year to BT.
Taken together, price cuts already made and those due by November will have
cut BT's charges by about 12 per cent over the course of the year.
BT said that an average business customer, with an annual call charge bill
of Pounds 431, would save Pounds 20 (4.6 per cent) after the long-distance
price cut. The average residential customer, with an annual bill of Pounds
164, would save Pounds 6 (3.7 per cent).
The changes leave BT with about Pounds 190m worth of cuts to make before the
end of the year. Analysts believe the most likely target is international
calls, where BT faces increasingly stiff competition.
Mercury earns nearly half its revenue from international calls, and several
new operators - including Worldcom and MFS - are competing hard for
corporate international business. Energis, a new UK long-distance operator
using electricity pylons for its network, opened for business this week.
BT also announced a range of improved discount schemes for high-usage
customers. Small businesses with quarterly call bills of Pounds 50 or more
will gain the most from the discount schemes.
Mr Michael Hepher, BT's managing director, said the price cuts 'were made
possible by BT's Pounds 20bn investment in modernising the UK telephone
network over the past 10 years'.
The Telecommunications Users Association welcomed BT's price cuts, and the
simplification of the tariff structure.

<TEXT>
MIM Holdings, the Queens-land-based metals and mining group, yesterday
announced a ADollars 195.1m (USDollars 145m) loss after tax in the year to
end-June, largely resulting from heavy abnormal charges. In the previous
year, it made a ADollars 74m profit, writes Nikki Tait.
Revenues were ADollars 2.31bn, up from ADollars 2.02bn previously.
MIM is paying a final dividend of 2.5 cents a share, after a similar
interim.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Recruitment: Women set for power in the big league - The
City is still waiting for the first female to chair a top 100 company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sooner or later a woman is going to become the chairman of an FT-SE 100
company. It may have escaped the notice of some men out there but the race
is on. The question many businesswomen are asking is who is going to be
first.
Suppose it is within the next 10 years; in fact let's be more adventurous
and look at the possibility before the turn of the century. Who might it be?
Where will the candidates come from?
Gill Carrick, a partner at Goddard Kay Rogers &amp; Associates, the executive
search firm, sides with those who expect a woman to break through before the
Millennium.
She said: 'I think it could well happen within the next five years but I
don't think it would necessarily cause a surge. I think we shall have one
and then a shocked silence as people assimilate it before we gradually get a
few more.'
Statistics drawn from the latest edition of Crawford's Dictionary of City
Connections show that the number of women chief executives of UK listed and
unlisted securities market companies had fallen from 12 in 1993 to nine this
year. The only women chairmen of sizeable companies were Aleksandra Clayton
of Alexanders Holdings, the car dealer, and Anna Vinton, joint chairman of
the Reject Shop.
The big league of the FT-SE 100, however, still awaits its first woman
chair. Here is a very subjective form guide gleaned from a trawl of
colleagues, headhunters and a few industrialists. Could it be any of the
following 12? They are listed in no particular order of preference.
Rosalind Gilmore, chairman of the Building Societies Commission. At 56, with
a civil service background, part of which was spent at the Treasury, she
certainly has gravitas, and the robust way she handled the Cheltenham and
Gloucester's proposal to sell out to Lloyds Bank proves she also has the
metal to take on a top job when she leaves near the end of the year.
At present she is the prospective chairman of the Arrow FM consortium
bidding for the London FM radio franchise but she is also well placed to
take on a bigger chairmanship if one becomes available.
Kathleen O'Donovan, at the BTR industrial conglomerate, must be a strong
contender. She the first woman finance director in an FT-SE 100 company at
the age of 34, and that move, in 1991, won her the European Women of
Achievement Award sponsored by the European Union of Women. She recently
took up a non-executive directorship at Ardagh, a Dublin-based glass maker.
Rosemary Thorne, finance director of J Sainsbury. Apart from collecting more
than 20 O-levels, she has the sort of industrial street cred still valued by
male-dominated boardrooms. Her business teeth were cut as a management
accountant with BOC, the industrial gases company, before moving into
retailing.
Her experience, particularly with Habitat-Mothercare and Harrods, gives her
a strong platform for a big retailing chairmanship if and when it comes
along.
Baroness Detta O'Cathain, the former managing director of the Milk Marketing
Board and current managing director of the Barbican Centre, still has a
series of non-executive directorships. A few years ago she would probably
have been the favourite because she occupied a very narrow field. This
tended to leave her somewhat overexposed at a time when the names of women
executives were difficult to recall.
Marjorie Scardino, chief executive of The Economist Group and non-executive
director of W H Smith, is a US-lawyer turned media executive. Her success in
increasing the newspaper's sales in the US made her an automatic choice for
The Economist job.
Bridget Macaskill, former marketing manager at Unigate, now president and
chief operating officer of Oppenheimer Management (the seventh-largest
marketer of mutual funds in the US, controlling Dollars 20bn) and a
non-executive director of Hillsdown Holdings.
June de Moller. When she took over as managing director of Carlton
Communications just more than a year ago she became the first woman to the
chief executive's job at an FT-SE 100 company. In an expanding industry she
has to be well placed to take on a chair although she will probably have to
wait a while if she is hoping to succeed Michael Green as chairman. Her
non-executive directorships include Anglian Water and Riverside Medical
Health Trust.
Pippa Wicks is far too young to be considered in the short term but she has
great potential. Wicks is the 31-year-old finance director of Courtaulds
Textiles. She is among those MBA-qualified finance directors who are prized
as much for their general boardroom skills as they are for their ability to
run the finance function. Recruited by Martin Taylor, the then chief
executive, before he moved to Barclays Bank, she is likely to emerge as a
strong contender in a few years' time.
Helen Schneider Lenne on the main board of Deutsche Bank and a non-executive
director of ICI. Schneider Lenne is one of the new breed of Euro-directors
bouncing into the large British boardrooms.
Rachael Lomax, 48, head of the economic secretariat in the Cabinet Office,
was formerly head of financial institutions and markets in the Treasury and
a one-time principal private secretary to Nigel Lawson, the former
chancellor. For some time she has been regarded as one of the Treasury
high-flyers and ranks among those civil service women who have been able to
thrive, partly because of its greater concern in recent years to provide
equality of opportunity.
Wenche Marshall Foster: chairman and chief executive of Perrier (UK). If you
can sell bubbly water in green bottles to the conservative British anything
is possible.
Yve Newbold, company secretary at Hanson, should probably be among the top
dozen contenders. However, company secretaries rarely make the top job. It
is no coincidence that many of those I have listed above are finance
directors or have backgrounds in finance.
Other women in high-earning City jobs, such as Carol Galley, director in
charge of pension funds at Mercury Asset Management, and some leading
headhunters, rule themselves out because of their existing work. The
conflict of interest would stop Galley from taking on a non-executive role,
so she is probably among the non-starters.
A best of the rest list might include Kamlesh Bahl, chairman of the Equal
Opportunities Commission, Frances Heaton, a director of Lazard Brothers
merchant bank and former director general of the takeover panel, and Megan
Richardson, director of planning at Barclays.
Elizabeth Symons, general secretary of the Association of First Division
Civil Servants, is daily handling powerful mandarins, used to getting their
way.
Mary Baker, president of Women in Management (a professional management
association for women in the UK), who could easily claim a place on the list
herself with non- executive directorships at four quoted companies, believes
that the Cadbury recommendations for the chairman and chief executive
function to be split has increased flexibility for a potential female
appointment, possibly from outside a particular company. 'Women are very
good at being number one which is why so many leave the corporate structure
and set up their own business,' she said.
Who could we list as non-starters? Lady Thatcher comes to mind. It would be
rather akin to the Rolling Stones playing at the London Paladium. They could
do it with ease but the orchestra would walk out.
The 12 suggestions are only for that coveted large company chairman's role.
Some would be too young if you believe that a woman is going to get there in
the short term. But they have been a long time waiting and may have to wait
some more. If I were a betting type I might have a flutter on Gilmore.

ADollars 56.8m (Dollars 41m) profit after tax and abnormals in the year to
end-June, up from ADollars 47m a year ago. The rise was scored on revenues
of ADollars 89.2m, 17.5 per cent higher than in the previous year.
The company, which acquired the large BBC Hardware retail chain in July,
said it was adding the Campbells Hardware Group for ADollars 81m from
Jamison Equity, the Australian conglomerate.
The company is also pulling out of the stevedoring business. It is planning
to sell its 25 per cent interest in Australian Stevedores for ADollars 28m
to Jamison Equity unless ANL, the government-owned shipping business,
exercises a pre-emptive right.

FT  31 AUG 94 / South African inflation rate rises to 8.2%

South Africa released worse-than-expected inflation figures yesterday,
pushing bond yields past the psychological barrier of 17 per cent, and
putting pressure on the government's ability to keep its annual deficit at
the budgeted level of 6.4 per cent.
The Consumer Price Index for July rose at an annualised rate of 8.2 per
cent, up from 7.5 per cent in June and a full percentage point above the
21-year low reached in April of 7.1 per cent. In response, rates on the
government's benchmark R150 bond rose to 17.05 per cent yesterday, before
dropping back to finish the day at 16.76 per cent.
Bond yields, which hit a low of 11.6 per cent in January, have been rising
steadily since the April elections and have soared over the past few weeks,
fuelled largely by fears of higher inflation and a lack of faith in
government promises of fiscal restraint. Economists say the recent rise in
the bond market could add between R1bn and R1.5bn (Dollars 280m-Dollars
420m) to the government's interest bill, which already accounts for some 17
per cent of the budget.
Also contributing to the bear market is continuing uncertainty over the
future of South Africa's two-tier currency. Government and monetary
officials are committed to scrapping the financial rand investment currency,
a move almost certain to send short-term interest rates rocketing, but have
given no timetable for the move. Thus, the currency and bond markets are
prey to continued activity by speculators trying to second-guess the
financial authorities.
In recent days, fears over the state of President Mandela's health and
worries that South Africa's international credit rating, soon to be
announced by the major agencies, will be lower than the anticipated BBB have
also contributed to the run.
An estimated 25,000 workers in the car-making industry, taking part in the
longest and costliest stoppage since President Mandela came to power in May,
rejected the employers' revised pay offer of 10.5 per cent, their union
leader announced yesterday.
By the end of last week, the strike by the National Union of Metalworkers of
South Africa had cost the industry more than R2.2bn in turnover, an official
of the Automobile Manufacturers Employers' Organisation said.

<TEXT>
Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano said yesterday his country was
unlikely to reach its target of creating a 30,000-strong army before its
first multi-party elections due in October, Reuter reports from Harare.
Mozambique, a former Portuguese colony, is supposed to have an army drawn
equally from troops of the ruling Frelimo party and the former rebel
movement Renamo under a 1992 peace accord which ended 16 years of civil war.
'The new army comprising both Frelimo Renamo is ready, but we won't reach
our target of 30,000 men before the elections,' Mr Chissano told a news
conference in Harare.
In recent months the United Nations, which is supervising the country's
transition to democracy, had expressed doubt that the painfully slow
integration of the former foes would be completed in time for the elections.
The Mozambican leader, on a brief visit to Zimbabwe, said preparations for
the polls were advanced with voter registration nearly completed.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Danish Elections: Denmark set for close poll race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Danish government's decision to call a general election on September 21
has put into place the final piece in an unprecedented series of elections
and referendums in the Nordic region this autumn. The Danish vote will come
just three days after Sweden's general election and will be followed in
October and November by referendums in Finland, Sweden and Norway on
European Union entry.
As a member of the EU for two decades, Denmark is playing a bit part in the
Nordic drama, but its election will be hard fought. Voters have an unusually
clear choice between left and right and opinion polls suggest that at
present the result is too close to call.
Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, Social Democrat prime minister, will be hoping that
an expected strong swing to the Social Democrats in Sweden will be mirrored
in Denmark.
He leads a four-party centre-left majority coalition, but opinion polls
suggest its two small centre party members may not win the necessary 2 per
cent of the vote to regain election to the Folketing (parliament). They hold
the balance between the main left- and right-wing blocs, the Centre
Democrats and the Christian People's Party - hence the starker confrontation
than usual between left and right.
The left-wing alternative (known to its opponents as 'the red cabinet') is a
new Social Democrat-dominated government in coalition with the Radical
Liberals, a social-liberal party which is a member of the present coalition.
An SDP-Radical government would have to rely for its majorities in the
Folketing on support from the left-wing Socialist People's Party (SPP).
Fewer inhibitions about high government spending, and an aggressive
environmental policy would be among the hallmarks of a government which
comes came under SPP influence - although its more extreme demands would be
strongly opposed by the Radical Liberals.
The right-wing alternative ('the black cabinet' say its opponents) would be
a coalition of the Liberal and Conservative parties, which formed the core
of the non-socialist governments which held office under Mr Poul Schluter
from 1982 to January 1993.
It offers curbs on welfare programmes, tight control of government spending,
a more favourable income tax regime and measures to make the labour market
more flexible by reducing high unemployment benefits and tightening
eligibility rules for benefit. This government would require the support of
the populist right-wing Progress party, formerly an anarchic maverick
shunned by mainstream parties.
However, it has now become sufficiently respectable for the Liberals and
Conservatives to be openly proposing a government allied with it.
In the economic debate, both right- and left-wing blocs are claiming credit
for Denmark's present relative success. The economy is set to grow this year
by about 4 per cent. There are large surpluses on the balance of payments
accounts, low inflation, and a budget deficit of modest proportions - about
5.5 per cent of gross domestic product. Unemployment is around 12 per cent
but beginning to decline.
Mr Rasmussen is claiming the credit, but the opposition insist it was their
policies between 1982 and 1993 which stabilised the economy and laid the
basis for recovery.
With Mr Schluter replaced as Conservative party leader by the lesser known
Mr Hans Engell, the right-wing charge is now being led by Mr Uffe
Ellemann-Jensen, the Liberal leader who was foreign minister from 1982 to
1993. The Liberals have performed better than the Conservatives in opinion
polls and this year's European parliament election, which makes Mr
Ellemann-Jensen favourite to lead a Liberal-Conservative government.
However, a clear-cut government of either left or right is far from assured.
Voters may yet reprieve the Centre Democrats and the Christian People's
party. That would be in keeping with a long tradition by which small parties
of the centre call the tune in brokering a coalition and the political
choices are fudged.

FT  31 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Recs in demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Regional electricity stocks (recs) staged another strong upward move, with
many hitting all-time highs as the market continued to look for evidence of
a big stake-building exercise, or possibly even a straight takeover move.
Dealers said they expected a wave of share buy-backs to impact on the market
before the recs go into their closed seasons, starting in mid-September.
Sentiment was again boosted by news of share buy-backs in the sector, with
Seeboard announcing that it had moved back into the market last Friday to
purchase a further million of its own shares, this time at 439p. The company
bought 2m at 425p a share last Wednesday.
Whispers in the market suggested that a predatory move could happen in the
next fortnight. Southern, up 21 at 834p and the sector's best performer
yesterday, was seen as both a potential target and predator. There were
rumours that the group could be lining up a pre-emptive strike against one
of the smaller recs as a potential defence against a US predator or a UK
group seeking strong cash generative assets.
Eastern Electricity was hit by profit-taking as dealers decided that it
might adopt a predatory stance among its smaller UK brethren. The shares
slid 9 to 854p.
The Scottish generators also attracted profit-taking ahead of next week's
regulatory review of their businesses. Hydro-Electric softened 2 to 425p and
Power relinquished 5 at 433p.
Oil shares were among the market's better performing areas. British
Petroleum touched 418p but eased back to close only fractionally ahead at
414 1/2 p in spite of more encouraging news from its exploration effort in
Colombia - its Colombian operations encountered what it described as a
'major new gas and condensate field'.
Energy specialists said the gas find was commercially viable and, more
importantly, was in an area where BP held exploration rights over
substantial areas.
Burmah Castrol rose 15 to 916p, albeit in limited turnover of 717,000
shares. The group is scheduled to report interims on Monday, but the rise in
the shares was said to have reflected a move by one marketmaker to fill in a
short position exposed by a programme trade executed last week.
High street retailer Kingfisher appreciated 7 to 554p on press reports
suggesting that it might take over Madalan, a private UK discount retailing
club. However, at least one market watcher thought the move unlikely.
Boots raced forward early in the day as some dealers came to the view that
SmithKline Beecham's Dollars 2.9bn acquisition of Kodak's Sterling Health
division could help the UK group obtain a favourable price for its
pharmaceuticals business. Boots has indicated that it wishes to sell the
division.
The shares, having jumped 14 on the talk, came off the top to finish a mere
3 ahead at 582p as brokers came to the view that there was little similarity
between the two groups.
Retailer Body Shop fell to the year's low of 204p as company attempts to
counter criticism of its environmental policies failed to calm an already
nervous market. A small rally saw the shares end a net 13 down at 205p.
Irish paper and packaging group Jefferson Smurfit announced that it had
bought an Austrian paper mill for IPounds 20.5m. The deal will provide a way
in to eastern European markets, but some analysts felt that it was too small
to impact significantly on the shares and suspected additional technical
position-taking. The stock rose 11 to 426p.
Paper group Bowater, which announced a Pounds 15.5m purchase in the
Netherlands, saw its shares recede 6 to 478p.
Textile issues were treading water ahead of publication of a big review by
one leading UK investment bank.
Conglomerates BTR and Hanson were actively traded, prompting some talk of a
switch between the two heavyweights. Analysts pointed to a 400p chart
resistance level for the former. BTR slipped 4 to 391 1/2 p on turnover of
5.2m, while Hanson, ex a 3.75p dividend, was off 2 1/2 at 257 1/2 p with
7.6m shares dealt.

<TEXT>
Turnover in food retailer Argyll Group jumped to 9m in busy trading of the
stock after the company announced the sale of 123 of its Lo-Cost outlets and
28 Presto stores for Pounds 39.4m.
The shares declined 9 to 307p on a combination of profit-taking after their
strong performance last Friday and fears that the sale might dilute earnings
per share. One analyst suggested that there could have been disappointment
that Argyll had not off-loaded the whole Lo-Cost chain - around 140 stores
remain unsold.
Mr James Edwardes Jones at Hoare Govett said the sale was bound to be
'mildly dilutive'. However, Mr Bill Myers at Yamaichi took the contrary view
and said: 'They have sold the least profitable chunk of the Lo-Cost chain
for a fair price and dilution seems exceedingly unlikely.'

FT  31 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Market warms to SB move

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The market was pleased by news that SmithKline Beecham (SB) was buying
Eastman Kodak's Sterling Health division for Dollars 2.9bn and the shares
performed strongly on high turnover.
In spite of the evident fit between the two groups, there was some surprise
at the move as SmithKline had already made extensive use of its cheque book
in May when it bought Diversified Pharmaceutical Services for Dollars 2.3bn.
The latest deal leaves the company with exceptionally high gearing, but
analysts said that was unlikely to worry investors as the group had interest
cover of well above 10 times.
Mr James Culverwell, pharmaceuticals specialist with Hoare Govett, commented
enthusiastically: 'This was a strategic acquisition in the classic
SmithKline mould. It makes outstanding sense at a realistic price.'
Mr Paul Woodhouse at Smith New Court added: 'It fits both geographically and
from a business perspective.'
Dealers marked up SmithKline's shares before trading began and the stock
held its price as the rest of the market slid back, the 'A' shares closing a
net 6 1/2 higher at 465 1/2 p with 6.3m changing hands. The Units, which
often reflect US interest, rose 10 to 421p on 6.7m traded.
The news was a reminder to the market that Sterling's household products
division was also up for sale, for between Dollars 1.7bn and Dollars 2bn.

FT  31 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Profit-takers hit shares in the blue
chip sectors - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The leading blue chip sectors abandoned an initial attempt to extend
pre-Bank Holiday gains. Modest profit-taking, encouraged by easier bond
prices and a slow start to the New York session, proved enough to take more
than 15 points off the FT-SE 100-share Index. The broader market, however,
remained firm, and the FT-SE Mid 250 Index put on a further 6.8 at 3,813.8.
London closed before the announcement that leading French banks were raising
base rates.
UK investors were said to be showing some caution ahead of tomorrow's
meeting at the Bundesbank and US employment data due at the end of the week.
Dealers believed that the odds are against any move in German interest rates
this week but were disinclined to take risks. Trading books, which had been
squared off on Friday in order to leave options open over a long weekend
when US and continental European markets were operating, remained balanced.
The final reading put the FT-SE 100 Index at 3,249.6 for a decline on the
day of 15.5 points. The loss of the Footsie 3,250 mark was seen as
unimportant in the context of last week's strong gains. Early trading took
the Footsie index to 3,280 but weakness in stock index futures and
government bonds took the heart out of equities before midsession. The final
picture was uninspiring, with London lacking confidence as the Dow Jones
Industrial Average dipped 2 points as investors weighed the implications of
a sharp setback in the July consumer confidence index compiled by the US
Conference Board.
Disappointment with the US figures focused attention on prospects for the
more important US employment data due on Friday. Analysts expect a further
rise in the jobs figure, indicating continued recovery in the US.
Trading remained brisk, with Footsie-listed stocks representing the bulk
(around 64 per cent) of the Seaq total of 550.3m shares changing hands. On
Friday, retail, or genuine investment, business was worth Pounds 1.51bn,
well up to the better levels of activity recorded as the market surged last
week.
Market fundamentals behind last week's advance were still in place, sterling
showing a steadier trend and confidence in the outlook for dividends and
earnings of British companies was still buoyant. However, some market
analysts had reminded investors at the weekend that higher base rates in the
UK were still likely before the end of the year.
Pharmaceuticals stocks found encouragement in the Dollars 2.9bn purchase by
SmithKline Beecham of Sterling Health from Eastman Kodak, which once again
threw the spotlight on the reshaping of the global medical products
industry. Lockheed Corporation's proposed Dollars 10bn merger with Martin
Marietta also spurred expectations of increased stock market activity.
Further takeover speculation surfaced in the food retailing sector, where J.
Sainsbury responded to suggestions that an acquisition in France was under
consideration. A scattering of similar special features helped give the
market a more mixed picture at the close than the fall in the Footsie
suggested.
Building construction shares stood out against the general trend as two
leading securities houses assessed prospects for recovery in the sector,
which also brushed off fears that a rise in UK base rates might not be long
delayed. But the profit-takers held sway in most of the consumer and
financial areas which had performed so strongly in the previous week.
UK market strategists believe that the list of US economic data and comment
will keep markets subdued this week unless Wall Street resumes its powerful
upward trend. UK investment funds are not expected to turn sellers in what
has become a positive stock market.

Profit-taking and 'marking time' were how traders described a poor trading
day in both stock index futures and the traded options, writes Joel Kibazo.
In futures, the September contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 3,287. This
turned out to be the day's high and the contract drifted lower for the next
few hours. The easier bond prices only served to increase the drift in the
first half and one trader said: 'The contract just cannot seem to shake off
the holiday mood.'
September steadied over the lunchtime period before the dull opening on Wall
Street triggered another retreat in the contract.
September finished at 3,263, down 24 from the previous close and at a strong
premium of 14 points to the underlying cash market. Volume remained very
poor, reaching only 8,333 lots by the close.
In spite of the modest volume, dealers remain positive about the underlying
tone of the market and expect a return to more positive territory in the
near future.
It was also a slow day in the traded options. Total turnover fell to 18,044
contracts, against Friday's figure of 34,796 lots. Among the index options,
the FT-SE 100 saw business of 5,817 lots and the Euro FT-SE 1,591 contracts.
GEC was the busiest stock option, trading 1,304 lots. It was followed by
Barclays with 1,112 contracts.

FT  31 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow climbs in tandem with
bonds

Wall Street
After a morning's pause, US stocks regained their stride yesterday afternoon
in tandem with an improving bond market, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 18.45 higher at 3,917.30. It was the
first time that the bellwether blue chip index had closed above the 3,900
mark since late February, the month when the Federal Reserve began its move
to tighter credit conditions. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500
was 1.50 ahead at 476.09. New York SE volume came to 294.5m shares.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite rose 1.23 to 452.69. The
Nasdaq composite, up 3.25 at 766.46, extended its winning streak to eight
consecutive sessions.
The day's economic news was mixed. The Commerce Department reported that
July sales of new homes were up 8.3 per cent, a little more than analysts
had expected.
However, the Conference Board said its August index of consumer confidence
was much weaker than forecast, suggesting a slowdown in spending in the
second half of this year.
The bond market chose to focus on the second of the two reports, bringing
moderate improvement to the inflation-sensitive 30-year government issue.
Equities, which had ignored a small decline in bonds in the previous
session, tried to strike out on their own again yesterday morning. But a
brief round of profit-taking petered out by midday, allowing share prices to
move higher. The improvement came even though many investors were reluctant
to make big moves until after Friday's August employment data, the most
important economic reading of the month.
Among the blue chips, suppliers of raw materials were the session's leaders,
with recent high-flyers such as Caterpillar taking a breather. Alcoa climbed
Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 83 3/8 , Bethlehem Steel advanced Dollars 1 to
Dollars 23 3/8 and International Paper rose Dollars 2 to Dollars 76 5/8 .
A fresh tranche of acquisition news raised some fanfare during the morning.
Investors piled into Lockheed after the announcement of its planned merger
with Martin Marietta in a Dollars 10bn stock transaction. The defence
contractor's share price rocketed 16.5 per cent, or Dollars 10 7/8 , to
Dollars 76 3/4 , while the value of its partner's stock appreciated Dollars
 7/8 to Dollars 48 3/4 .
The news triggered buying throughout the defence sector. McDonnell Douglas
rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 118 7/8 and Litton Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 39
1/4 .
Elsewhere, Reliance Electric jumped Dollars 5, or 25 per cent, to Dollars 24
7/8 after announcing a decision to merge with General Signal. Investors in
the latter were displeased by the move, leaving its share price down Dollars
1 3/4 at Dollars 35 1/2 .
AMR, parent of American Airlines, gained Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 59 1/2 .
The company said it was streamlining its management as the first step in a
restructuring plan designed to save Dollars 1bn.
On the Nasdaq, technology issues were mixed. Cyrix lost Dollars 3 1/4 at
Dollars 40 3/4 but Microsoft added Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 58 3/8 .
Canada
Toronto finished narrowly mixed in busy trading after a modest rally late in
the session lifted the market from earlier lows. Dealers expect trade to
quieten as the Labour Day holiday weekend nears.
The TSE 300 composite index gained 1.28 at 4,333.71, although declines
outnumbered advances by 385 to 374. Volume totalled 89.7m shares, up from
Monday's 57.2m.
Seven of the 14 sub-indices closed higher, led by the golds group, up 1.5
per cent. In the sector, American Barrick put on CDollars  7/8 at CDollars
30 5/8 , while Lac Minerals rose CDollars  1/2 to CDollars 14 7/8 on volume
of 14.6m shares, as Royal Oak Mines announced that it is dropping its
takeover bid for Lac and will tender its Lac shareholding to Barrick's
competing bid. Royal Oak firmed CDollars  1/8 to CDollars 5 7/8 .
Financial services had the day's biggest fall, 1.3 per cent.
Venezuela
Caracas turned in its strongest performance for more than a week, in a
technical recovery following falls in recent days and amid optimism about
the government's new macroeconomic plan, due shortly.
The Merinvest Composite index moved ahead 3.08, or 2.2 per cent, to 143.22.

FT  31 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Strong golds help S Africa
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold shares were the feature of Johannesburg trading as a rally in the
bullion price lifted the golds index by 63, or 2.8 per cent, to 2,297.
The good gains in the sector offset a softer showing among industrial
shares, helping to take the overall index ahead to 5,845 from a previous
close of 5,822.
Industrials remained under pressure, the index weakening 39 to 6,539 as
investors worried that the latest rise in inflation could lead to higher
interest rates.
Kloof, the gold miner, gained R1.75 at R69.75, while Gencor edged up 10
cents to R13.50 in anticipation of good year-end results due after the
market closed. Vaal Reefs advanced R10 to R428.
Barlows, the industrial group, relinquished 50 cents at R31.75, while Iscor,
the steel producer, finished 1 cent softer at R4.18 ahead of annual results
due today.

FT  31 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Profit-taking hits
Nikkei as Hong Kong rises 3.1%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Small-lot profit-taking by banks depressed share prices and the Nikkei 225
average edged down in low volume, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index finished 8.23 easier at 20,592.12 after a day's low of 20,503.70
and high of 20,629.93. Selling by banks and companies ahead of the September
interim book closing continued to depress investor confidence, while
arbitrage buying and purchases by public funds supported the index in the
afternoon.
Many foreign investors were absent from trading following Monday's holiday
in the UK and Hong Kong. Individual investors, meanwhile, focused trading on
the over the counter market, and volume sank to 183m shares from 206m.
The Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 2.71 to 1,637.37 and the
Nikkei 300 lost 0.21 at 298.16. Losers led gainers by 601 to 308, with 223
issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 0.82 firmer at
1,331.91.
Market participants dabbled in telecommunication linked stocks ahead of
Japan Telecom's listing, while some overseas investors took profits on steel
shares. Traders hoped domestic institutional activity would recover when
profit-taking had run its course. 'The index should be looking better in
about two weeks' time,' commented a Japanese broker.
Sumitomo Metal, the most active issue of the day, rose Y3 to Y348 on buying
by foreigners. However, selling by overseas investors depressed NKK, Y2
lower at Y283, and carmakers Toyota Motor and Nissan Motor, which receded
Y10 to Y2,140 and by Y13 to Y766 respectively.
Selling by individuals drove some speculative favourites down. Sumitomo Coal
Mining retreated Y46 to Y769 and Chino, a measuring instrument maker,
plunged Y100 to Y817.
Buying of telecommunication stocks spilled over into other high-technology
issues. Sony gained Y120 at Y6,020 and Hitachi Y6 at Y981.
Advantest, the semiconductor testing device maker, advanced Y80 to Y3,430
following reports of a sharp rise in profits during the first half of the
current business year.
Reports of improved earnings supported truck makers. Hino Motors put on Y20
at Y962 and Nissan Diesel added Y13 at Y599.
In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 54.09 to 22,872.61 in volume of 48.2m
shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, shed Y70 to Y6,330.
Roundup
Positive performances were again seen in some of the Pacific Rim markets.
HONG KONG rose 3.1 per cent as it returned after a long holiday weekend and
responded to Wall Street's rally and some better than expected corporate
results. The Hang Seng index jumped 287.48 to 9,686.56 in turnover of
HKDollars 5.19bn, against Friday's HKDollars 3.10bn, with US and Japanese
institutions identified as strong buyers.
Cheung Kong moved ahead HKDollars 1.60 to HKDollars 38.10 and Hutchison
gained HKDollars 1.80 at HKDollars 37.60, both continuing to benefit from
their results announced late last week.
BANGKOK rallied through the day as active buying of blue chips alternated
with slight profit-taking in finance and property issues. The SET index
closed at the day's high, up 32.29 or 2.2 per cent at 1,492.53. Turnover
reached a heavy Bt14.21bn.
KUALA LUMPUR was lifted by institutional interest in Telekom Malaysia and
the composite index rose 9.64 to 1,130.01, up from a morning's low of
1,112.95. Telekom climbed 70 cents to MDollars 21.40, adding to Monday's 40
cents advance.
SEOUL was slightly higher in moderate trading on gains by low-priced issues
with good earnings prospects. The composite index closed 3.84 up at 939.85
in volume that remained low at 25.8m shares.
MANILA rebounded in higher volume from Monday's dip, reflecting strong
support at current levels, although brokers said a correction would be
welcome. The composite index ended 11.80 ahead at 3,104.07 in volume of
5.3bn shares, compared with Monday's 2.5bn.
SYDNEY edged ahead in good volume, although investors were said to be
cautious of Wall Street pulling back overnight. The All Ordinaries index
rose 4.6 to 2,116.5.
CRA gave up 44 cents to ADollars 20 as analysts said its first-half results
were within expectations and that the stock now looked fully priced.
SHANGHAI's A share index gained 6.6 per cent after a buying spree in
large-capital issues and the blue chip, Pudong. The index put on 48.39 at
776.39.
Shanghai's B shares rose for the fifth straight trading day, adding 0.94, or
1.2 per cent, at 79.38.
TAIPEI saw heavy profit-taking after Monday's advance which had taken the
market to a four-year high. The weighted index fell 60.24 to 6,980.28, after
an intraday high of 7,069.89, in turnover of TDollars 96.7bn.
Plastics shares, which led previous gains, were hardest hit, with China
Petrochemical losing TDollars 1.50 at TDollars 45.30.
SINGAPORE edged lower as a few sellers pushed down share prices in a market
that lacked buying interest. The Straits Times Industrial index closed 6.29
off at 2,299.51.
Malaysian shares traded over the counter recovered moderately in the
afternoon, but pulled back slightly in the last half-hour as cautious
investors preferred to take profits ahead of Malaysia's National Day holiday
today.

FT  31 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Euro Disney rebounds before
rise in base rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lacking a further push from Wall Street, bourses consolidated, or declined a
little, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS closed before four French banks added 25 basis points to their base
lending rates, a move which Mr Michael Woodcock at Nikko Europe thought was
politically driven.
Earlier, market turnover fell from FFr2.4bn to an even thinner FFr1.96bn as
the CAC-40 shed 14.90 to 2,060.37. Once again, the main highlight of the day
was the gyrating Euro Disney, suspended limit down early in the morning when
it hit a low of FFr7.55, and three times limit up: the company met analysts
in the afternoon and the shares eventually closed 70 centimes higher at
FFr9.10.
Elsewhere, Docks de France climbed FFr26, or 3.5 per cent, to FFr778 on
renewed rumours that the UK's J. Sainsbury, which has already denied the
story, would buy the French supermarket operator.
Among the day's losers, Elf Aquitaine lost FFr4.50 at FFr414 ahead of
tomorrow's first-half results. Mr Woodcock noted that the oil company had
already flagged a 20 per cent drop in operating income, and said that
analysts will be looking for signs of a recovery in chemicals, and progress
in debt reduction.
Michelin had its fourth day on the downgrade, losing FFr2.40 at FFr232.60 on
fears of a price war in the European tyres market.
FRANKFURT followed Monday's pattern in the morning, doing its best to
consolidate the previous day's post-bourse gains, but it had nothing left in
the afternoon and the Ibis-indicated Dax closed 9.90 lower on the day at
2,205.82.
Turnover rose from DM6.9bn to DM7.6bn. In the automotive sector, BMW was
down DM9 to DM831 at the end of the day and Continental, the tyremaker, by
DM4 to DM256.50. Analysts said that BMW had simply run out of momentum;
Conti, last week, forecast only a slight increase in profits this year after
reasonable first-half gains.
In retailing, lower first-half earnings at Kaufhof left the shares down DM9
at DM547; among the engineers, recently popular stocks such as Linde and
Preussag fell DM13 to DM949 and DM7 to DM496; but a strong technical
position took Veba up DM6 to DM555.50 in utilities, and its competitor Viag
DM5.30 higher to DM506.
ZURICH consolidated after Monday's sharp rise, the SMI index ending 0.5
higher at 2,635.7. UBS bearers, however, remained in favour, adding another
SFr7 at SFr1,167 and Ciba, due to release half-year profits figures this
morning, put on SFr6 at SFr827.
Alusuisse, which said it expected consolidated sales to rise above SFr7bn
this year and net profit to be double the 1993 level, rose SFr11 in
immediate response before easing back to end SFr8 up at SFr700.
Insurers closed slightly higher, with Zurich Insurance registered shares
SFr5 ahead at SFr1,275.
AMSTERDAM turned lower after five straight days of advances, under pressure
from Wall Street, softer bonds and the weaker dollar. The AEX index
retreated 3.60 to 421.00, also depressed by ABN Amro and Aegon trading
ex-dividend.
The publishing sector bucked the trend as investors were seen switching from
cyclical stocks. Wolters Kluwer added Fl 1.60 at Fl 121.30 and VNU rose 60
cents to Fl 185.50 ahead of first-half results expected today.
Stork, the machinery group, declined Fl 1.60 to Fl 47.50, with its
announcement of a 33 per cent increase in first-half profits failing to
match expectations. The group will release further details to analysts
today.
Philips fell 90 cents to Fl 58 on US selling and Royal Dutch gave up Fl 1 of
recent advances to finish at Fl 198.
MILAN continued to await tangible budget news from the government and shares
slipped back in thin trade, with many investors still away on holiday. The
Comit index receded 5.88 to 688.82.
Among the large industrial stocks, firm on Monday, Fiat gave back L80 to
L6,535, Montedison relinquished L12 to L1,412 and Pirelli declined L30 to
L2,600.
Benetton was one of the few stocks to advance, as the firming dollar
prompted arbitrage trade between the shares listed in Milan and New York.
The Milan shares advanced L413 to L25,166.
Insurers were subdued, having already discounted the announcement that the
government had suspended the 15 per cent tax on contributions to private
pension schemes for six months. Generali fell L333 to L42,053 and Ras was
L265 lower at L25,994.
MADRID featured a drop in turnover from Pta18bn to Pta15.7bn as the general
index closed 1.29 lower at 313.18, but there was some joy in the market
after a 41 per cent rise in first-half net profits at Gas Natural, which
rose Pta260 to Pta10,450. Repsol, the oil company which owns 46 per cent of
Gas Natural, rose a token Pta10 to Pta4,195.
STOCKHOLM was lower on profit-taking and the Affarlsvarden index lost 10.90
to 1,451.40 as initially quiet trading picked up late in the day.
Volvo 'B' shares fell SKr3 to SKr147 in spite of six-month figures at the
top end of expections. In subsequent New York trade, the Volvo ADR dipped
Dollars  3/8 by early afternoon to Dollars 19 1/8 as investors took quick
profits.
Skandia, the insurer, fell SKr4 to SKr113 in response to its half-yearly
figures which came late on Monday.
Among companies due to report interim figures today, Astra's 'A' stock shed
SKr3 to SKr175 and MoDo 'B' gave up SKr6 to SKr350, but SCA 'B' rose SKr3 to
SKr114.
COPENHAGEN, weak this month, blamed the impending expiry of the KFX
September future as the KFX index hit a new low for the year, down 1.36 at
96.84.
TEL AVIV's recovery took it through 183.40 - the level at which it stood
before a selling stampede, following news of a 10 per cent capital gains tax
on share transactions, pushed it down 9.9 per cent 10 days ago. The
Mishtanim index moved ahead a further 3.81, or 2.1 per cent, to 183.75.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Currencies in tight range
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Currencies yesterday moved in fairly narrow ranges ahead of tomorrow's
Bundesbank council meeting and the release of key US labour data on Friday,
writes Philip Gawith.
There was little fresh news for the market to chew on, aside from some US
data which had little impact on the dollar. The US currency ended in London
at DM1.5805, slightly down from Monday's close of DM1.5831. Against the yen
it finished at Y99.665 from Y100.225. In New York it closed at DM1.5765 and
Y99.615.
In Europe, the D-Mark was generally weaker as it suffered at the hands of
the firmer dollar. Markets were surprised by the decision of four French
commercial banks to lift interest rates and this saw the franc slip to
FFr3.4275 per D-Mark yesterday evening from a London close of FFr3.4223.
Sterling had an uneventful day, holding on to most of the gains made on
Monday as it rose in tandem with the dollar. The trade weighted sterling
index finished at 79 after Monday's 78.9.
The dollar showed little reaction to news of US July home sales and consumer
confidence figures for August.
Although the dollar is firmer after the recent rally, few analysts are
confident that it has turned the corner.
Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-Amro Bank in London, said the
reasoning cited for the dollar's recent rally - that it was following the
bond market, which improved on weaker than expected second-quarter GDP
figures - was flimsy.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, said the dollar's
recovery on Friday had been mostly interbank driven, and had also been
related to the exercise of various options contracts.
He added: 'The upside movement we have seen in the US dollar does not look
sustainable. Fund managers are still broadly neutrally positioned and there
is no great incentive to go long dollars at the moment. Although the worst
for the dollar is certainly over, those who are calling for a big move up
will not get much of a hearing from financial institutions.'
Hopes of a breakthrough in US-Japan trade framework talks have supported the
dollar in recent days. But Mr Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High
Frequency Economics in New York, commented: 'It seems to us that Japan is
turning more pugnacious than compliant with US trade demands.'
Over the weekend, Japanese officials leaked a report that challenges the
US's strong moral line on government procurement. The report claims that
although Japan's sourcing of offshore contractors only amounts to 0.6 per
cent of public sector spending allocated, this is 10 times the percentage
the US spends.
Other observers, however, attach more significance to the dollar rally. Mr
Mike Norman, publisher of the Geneva based Economic Contrarian Update,
argues that 'Friday's dollar move was the start of a major turnround in the
currency'.
He said the market is short of dollars to the extent that there is
'absolutely no more firepower left on the downside'. The flip side of the
argument is that the short positions in the market 'will be providing the
buying power to move the dollar up'.
Analysts said the decision by four French banks to raise their base rates to
7.95 per cent from 7.70 per cent was a cry of despair at their increased
funding costs. Mr Avinash Persaud, currency strategist at JP Morgan in
Europe, said that while the move had market significance, it did not have
policy significance. The Bank of France is not expected to respond.
He predicted, however, that interest rates across the yield curve were
likely to rise. This could have a dampening effect on French bond and equity
markets, and hence on the franc. Mr Persaud predicted that the franc would
weaken back to the FFr3.43 level against the D-Mark.
Analysts noted that if the decision by the French translates into
generalised money market volatility in Europe, this could have the effect of
supporting the D-Mark.
PIBOR futures lost about 15 basis points after the banks made their
announcement.
Traders said the French rate move had a negative effect on the short
sterling market, which had otherwise traded quite firmly in recent days.
Investors, however, remain focused on the September 7 monthly monetary
meeting, which could herald a tightening of UK monetary policy.
Mr Richard Phillips, analyst at broker GNI, said two factors had supported
short sterling in recent days: the 'convergence' factor, and improved
psychology in the market.
The former is the fact that the price of the September short sterling
contract must converge on the cash price of three-month money as the expiry
date - September 21 - approaches. Currently, three-month money at 5 7/16
compares with the September contract discounting an interest rate of about
5.75 per cent.
The Bank of England supplied UK money markets with Pounds 474m liquidity, at
established rates, after forecasting a Pounds 450m shortage.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Anglo aims to be big player in
mineral sands market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>

   NAMAQUALAND
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Here on this remote coast in the least populated region of South Africa
Anglo American Corporation is putting the final touches to a project that
will enable this country's biggest company to elbow its way into the global
mineral sands market, which is dominated by RTZ of the UK.
The Namakwa Sands project, based on one of the world's biggest mineral sands
deposits, will, by Anglo's calculations, by 2000, give it nearly 6 per cent
of the USDollars 1bn titanium dioxide business, supplying a material
essential in the production of many paints, papers and plastics.
Anglo also aims for more than 13 per cent of the Dollars 160m market for
zircon, used to impart whiteness to ceramics such as tiles, sanitary ware
and china. Namakwa will also produce pig iron, used in many foundry
applications but particularly for automotive castings. This market should be
worth about Dollars 850m by the turn of the century and Anglo is looking for
a modest 2 per cent.
Mr George Brown, general manager of the Namakwa Sands company, stresses that
Anglo is not taking a particularly aggressive approach. With demand for
titanium dioxide growing annually at between 2.5 and 3 per cent there should
be room for a newcomer in an industry with only a handful of competitors.
Namakwa has only one real rival, he says, Richards Bay Minerals, which is
mining on South Africa's east coast and has more than half the market. Its
major shareholder is RTZ.
All mineral sands are radioactive but the level is low in the Richards Bay
and Namakwa material, he says. This gives them a marketing advantage,
particularly with countries such as Germany and Japan where customers are
edgy about this factor.
RTZ also owns QIT which mines mineral sands in Canada. Australia is another
big producer via Renison Goldfields in which Hanson, the Anglo-American
conglomerate has a 40 per cent interest.
Anglo owns 80 per cent of Namakwa, which is mining a deposit near the sea
about 80km north-west of Vredendal on the west coast of the Cape Province.
The deposit, containing enough mineral sands for 35 years' production, was
nearly overlooked when the company explored the area because its
radioactivity was so much less than sands further north. It is on land
bought in the 1930s for its diamond potential by De Beers, Anglo's sister
company, which has 20 per cent of the project.
Sensitive to the environmental issues that loomed large when Richards Bay
recently wanted to mine beach sands, Namakwa has hired Mr Johan Grobler, a
botanist with 26 years' experience at the Kirstenbosch Gardens in Cape Town,
as environmental officer. As it would not be possible to rehabilitate the
beach here properly, the company will not mine 20m tonnes of sand with a
theoretical value of Dollars 90m.
Elsewhere it is spending Dollars 330 a hectare to rehabilitate an area where
farm land costs only Dollars 33 a hectare.
The mineral sands are mined and put through concentration plants at the mine
site before being trucked along a new road to a mineral separation plant
60km away at Koekenaap. This plant was built away from the mine because of
the fog that frequently envelops the area. Namakwa hopes to turn this
phenomenon to its advantage and is experimenting to see if it can collect
fresh water from the fog. In Chile a similar scheme resulted in three litres
of water a day being collected from every square metre of special screening
material, enough to provide for a small community that previously had to
truck in its water at great expense.
Material from the separation plant will be sent by rail to a new smelter
nearly 200km away near the Saldanha Bay export terminal. Most will be stored
before shipping but the ilmenite will be upgraded to titanium dioxide slag,
worth more than three times as much. The smelter is the first in the
industry to use direct current or plasma arc technology which has been
employed successfully by South Africa's ferrochrome producers. Anglo worked
with Mintek, a South African government sponsored technology group, to
develop the technology.
The smelter should be ready early next year and by 2000 Namakwa should be in
full production, employing more than 800 people and producing annually
196,000 tonnes of titanium dioxide, 119,000 tonnes of pig iron, 123,000
tonnes of zircon and 36,000 tonnes of rutile.
About 95 per cent of the revenue is expected to come from overseas customers
in Europe and North America. Anglo estimates that annual export earnings at
full production will be equivalent to Dollars 80m in 1994. This export
potential, coupled with the upgrading of the ilmenite, helped get the
project off the ground financially. Namakwa qualified for a special tax
scheme for big exporters that was worth Dollars 45m when the project was
given the go-ahead in November 1992.
Namakwa is also benefitting from a loan of Dollars 60m with deferred
interest of Dollars 6.6m from the Industrial Development Corporation,
another South African government backed organisation. Anglo and De Beers
have put up the equity of R576m (Dollars 127m).

FT  31 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Britain's
grain harvest lower but good in parts - Unfavourable weather has hit yields
in some parts of the country, though quality is up to standard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 35 years of farming I can remember only three occasions when we have
finished the harvest before the end of August - and this year is the third.
It was achieved by working over most of the bank holiday weekend.
If I am totally honest I should admit that we have not quite finished, there
are still a few beans to do as well as a couple of fields of linseed grown
for industrial use on set-a-side land. But all the wheat is in the barn.
That represents the main harvest on this farm, so we feel we can relax a
little.
As I forecast in this column a few times, yields were down on last year,
although not as drastically as I once feared. The appallingly wet conditions
into which many of the wheat crops were planted last autumn, followed by
still more unwelcome rain in the spring and then a heatwave in July, were
hardly the best mix of weather for heavy yields.
But as I drove the combine harvester during the regular drivers' meal
breaks, I was pleased to note that some of the patches that were flooded for
much of the winter had recovered quite well. Only the crops planted after
sugar beet into near-impossibly muddy conditions were really thin. In the
event, I estimate, in advance of putting the crop over a weighbridge, that
we have harvested between half and three quarters of a tonne less wheat per
acre than last year to average about three and a quarter tonnes. It could
have been so much worse.
I am told by farming friends in other parts of the country that this drop in
yield is by no means universal. In the south and west of England most wheat
yields have been as good or better than last year. The most disappointing
crops have been in the east, where I farm, and the north, although there is
still a considerable acreage to harvest in the north and Scotland so it is
perhaps too soon to make a definitive judgment on the size of the national
crop.
It is fairly clear, however, that all over the UK the quality of the grain
is generally good and well up to European Union, and therefore merchants',
required standards. This applies to both berry size and weight although, in
the case of milling wheat, protein content and baking quality are somewhat
variable.
More satisfying is the price which is probably more than Pounds 10 a tonne
(10 per cent to 12 per cent) more than most UK farmers budgeted last year.
There are a number of reasons for this. The continuing devaluation of
sterling against other EU currencies has, through the green monetary system,
raised the UK intervention price for common (milling) wheat and that has
created a firm base for all wheat, including that grown for feed and even
that sold for delivery before intervention starts in November.
Higher than expected grain prices are not confined to the UK, however. All
over Europe they are above budget. This can only be because perceived
shortage compared with expected demand across the community as a result of a
combination of set-a-side, below average yields and the likely requirements
of third countries.
But high grain prices add to the problems of the already stretched intensive
livestock sector by raising the cost of animal feed. To try to reduce this
burden the European Commission, a few days ago, increased the volume of
grain on EU markets by releasing 1.6m tonnes from the 14m it held in
intervention stores. Prices dropped a couple of pounds a tonne as a result
but only for a few days and have since bounced back almost to where they
were before the release. The trade obviously believes the shortage is real
for the time being.
Meanwhile, according to the International Wheat Council, world wheat
production is expected to be down by 23m tonnes this year as a result of
reductions in output in several northern hemisphere countries and declining
prospects in Australia.
So, as I steered the combine harvester round our final field of wheat last
weekend, I reflected how times had changed. It seemed only yesterday that we
farmers were being accused of producing grain that nobody wanted. 'Put your
farms down to trees and theme parks,' the critics had said. 'We don't need
you any more.' And most of us in the UK responded by reluctantly accepting
the EU's shilling to set aside 15 to 18 per cent of our land.
Is that policy already out of date? Is it time to bring that land back to
cultivation? Can we rely on the politicians, who usually take years to make
a decision, to react fast enough to avoid a major world grain shortage?

A pay and conditions offer by Falconbridge of Canada, the second biggest
western nickel producer, has been rejected as 'unrealistic' by the mine,
mill and smelter workers' union at its operation in Sudbury, Ontario but
talks were continuing yesterday in the hope that a walkout by 1,300 miners
at 8am today could be averted.
Neither side would reveal the terms of the offer, but Mr Gary Hrytsak,
vice-president of Local 598, said: 'It looks as though we'll be walking out
barring an 11th hour company proposal.'
He said the union had asked Falconbridge to negotiate realistically on
money, job security, contracting-out, fringe benefits and overtime, but 'the
company continues to drag its feet.' Mr Gerald Foley, Falconbridge's chief
negotiator said, however: 'We believe we have a realistic offer on the table
and that in the remaining hours we both can reach agreement.'
Last year Falconbridge produced 38,500 tonnes of nickel and 48,000 tonnes of
copper at its Sudbury mines, plus cobalt and platinum group metals. With its
neighbour Inco, it has recently found major new sources of high grade ore at
greater depths.
Inco settled with its mine unions last May. The hourly rate remained
unchanged in the three-year contract but the benefits package amounted to
about 4 per cent over the contract life.
Reaction at the London Metal Exchange was muted, nickel's three months
delivery price closing only Dollars 132.50 higher at Dollars 6,125 a tonne.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium pact probe shrugged
off at LME
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
London Metal Exchange traders yesterday shrugged off last Friday night's
news that a US investigation was being mounted into the operation of the
informal aluminium output-cutting pact agreed earlier this year.
Reuters reported from Washington that the Justice Department had sent
letters to US producers in response to an allegation of price fixing.
Several producers had confirmed they had received a 'civil investigative
demand' from the department but declined to comment on the specific
allegations.
However, industry officials said producers were accused of using the pact as
a cover for price fixing.
'We recently received notice of an investigation and a civil investigative
demand from the Department of Justice regarding primary aluminium
production,' said Mr Tom Hagley, director of public and investor relations
with Alumax.
'We intend to co-operate with the government's investigation. The company is
confident that its activities and operations have conformed with applicable
laws.'
A memorandum of understanding was signed in March by major aluminium
producers in an attempt to resolve oversupply problems that worsened when
Russia began selling on world markets.
In Brussels the European Aluminium Association told Reuters it was very
surprised about the investigation.
'I don't understand it,' the EAA president Mr Dick Dermer said, noting that
the Justice Department was 'well represented' at the pact negotiations.
At the LME the three months delivery aluminium price rose Dollars 3.75
yesterday to close at Dollars 1,517.50 a tonne.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Government Bonds: European prices hit by French rate rises
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A heavy calendar of supply weighed on European government bonds yesterday
amid concern that the markets would have difficulty in absorbing the large
amounts on offer.
Bond prices were dealt a further blow late in the day when leading French
commercial banks said they planned to raise their base rates by 25 basis
points to 7.95 per cent from tomorrow. French 10-year government bonds fell
around a half-point on the news.
Analysts interpreted the banks' action, which was independent of the Bank of
France and designed to counter their own rising cost of funding, as a
further confirmation that European interest rates are heading upwards. They
added, however, that the banks obviously felt that demand from the private
sector was sufficiently robust to cope with higher interest rates.
Investors were also sidelined ahead of the Bundesbank meeting tomorrow and
the US employment report on Friday. Some analysts expect the German central
bank to return to a variable rate repo, but the market does not expect a
change in official interest rates.
Mr Kit Juckes at S. G. Warburg said the Bundesbank had to show that it could
manage the trough in interest rates better than the central banks in Italy
and Sweden, which stunned the markets with the timing of their rate rises
recently.
'Inflation is in a trough, the economy is recovering so the Bundesbank can
only make cosmetic adjustments,' Mr Juckes said.
On Liffe, the September bund future was barely changed in the late
afternoon, down 0.04 points at 92.00.
UK gilts had a disappointing day, given their potential to outperform in the
near term. On Liffe, the September long gilt future fell  5/8 to 101 3/4 .
Dealers said the weakness reflected professional selling following the
narrowing of the yield spread between 10-year gilts and bunds to less than
150 basis points late last week.
There is some debate on whether the spread can narrow further. Salomon
Brothers believes the spread will drop to 125 basis points by year-end, but
Hoare Govett says such a tightening will require further gains from
sterling.
US Treasury bonds were finishing moderately higher yesterday afternoon after
a quiet session highlighted by mixed economic news.
Late in the day, the benchmark 30-year bond was  13/32 better at 100 7/16 ,
with the yield slipping to 7.457 per cent, and the two-year note was up
1/16 at 100 5/32 , yielding 6.149 per cent.
Activity remained lacklustre as traders awaited guidance on the direction on
the economy.
Yesterday brought good news and bad. On the negative side, the Commerce
Department reported an 8.3 per cent increase in July sales of new homes,
higher than expected.
But traders chose to focus on the Conference Board's consumer confidence
index coming in well under forecast. The data suggested a slowdown in
consumer spending in the first half, a favourable development for
inflation-sensitive bonds.

FT  31 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Lion withdraws from US

<TEXT>
Lion, a leading Japanese maker of household goods, is withdrawing from the
domestic pet food and US consumer goods market, dissolving operations set up
in the 1980s as a part of its diversification programme.
The company will post a special loss of Y7bn (Dollars 7m) for the current
year to March, but earnings projections will not be altered as the loss will
be covered by profits from securities sales.
Many Japanese companies are starting to restructure operations set up in the
1980s, when investment in new businesses was prevalent. The downturn in the
Japanese economy and falling cash flow from their main businesses have
prompted many companies to review diversification schemes.
Lion entered the US consumer goods market in 1985, setting up Lion America,
which sold toothpaste and other household products. However, increasing
marketing costs and competition have squeezed its profit margins and the
rise in the yen has pushed up its prices.

FT  31 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: NEC sees sharp upturn in
profits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NEC, the Japanese electronics company, has revised upwards both its parent
company and consolidated sales and profits forecasts for the year to March
1995, mainly on the strength of firm demand for the company's personal
computers and semiconductors.
The company is forecasting a particularly sharp upturn in sales and profits
in the six months to September.
Parent pre-tax profits in the first half are now expected to reach Y20bn
(Dollars 199.6m), or double the May forecast of Y10bn and compared with an
Y8.5bn loss in the first half of fiscal 1994. Net profits are forecast at
Y10bn, compared with a Y9.3bn loss previously and an earlier forecast of
Y6bn.
Sales for the half-year are expected to be Y1,380bn for the parent company,
up 4 per cent from the same period last year, rather than the Y1,370bn
forecast in May.
NEC said that it had seen strong demand for its PCs in the home market. PC
sales were forecast to rise 4 per cent to Y490bn in the year, but NEC has
revised this upwards to a 15 per cent rise to Y540bn.
The company has also enjoyed the benefits of a strong pick-up in worldwide
demand for semiconductors. NEC expects demand in Asia to rise 50 per cent
over last year, while demand in the important Japanese market is forecast to
rise 9 per cent.
However, the company is slightly more conservative in its forecasts for the
full year, due to the uncertainty over theyen's strength.
For the full year NEC expects parent company sales of Y3,030bn, up from an
earlier forecast of Y3,000bn, and pre-tax profits of Y60bn rather than
Y50bn.
On a consolidated basis, NEC expects sales to rise 5 per cent to Y3,760bn,
pre-tax profits to be Y70bn and net profits to be Y35bn for the full year.
The new forecast compares with an earlier one for sales of Y3,720bn, pre-tax
profits of Y60bn and net profits of Y30bn.

FT  31 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: First-half fall in net
earnings at CRA
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CRA, the Australian mining group in which RTZ of the UK holds a 49 per cent
stake, has announced after-tax profits of ADollars 296.6m (USDollars 220m)
for the half-year to June, down from ADollars 360m in the same period of
1993. Total revenues were ADollars 3.43bn against ADollars 2.87bn.
The figures are calculated on a statutory consolidated basis; on an
equity-accounted basis, CRA said after-tax profit would have shown a fall of
ADollars 51.7m to ADollars 327.9m.
Even on the non-equity accounted basis, the comparisons are muddied by
abnormal items. The ADollars 296.6m profit includes a ADollars 160.1m
pre-tax abnormal surplus, representing the profit on the sale of CRA's stake
in Pasminco earlier this year. The result also includes a ADollars 19.4m
charge, stemming from a fall in pension fund surpluses.
CRA said if these factors were excluded, operating profits after tax but
before the pension fund adjustment and the Pasminco gain would have stood at
ADollars 200.2m, a ADollars 70.4m fall from the first half of 1993.
Most of CRA's core divisions saw profits fall in the half year. On an
equity-accounted basis and after tax, iron ore's contribution to earnings
fell to ADollars 146.2m from ADollars 191m, while coal was down to ADollars
55.4m from ADollars 119.5m. Both were hit by the reduced prices agreed with
important Japanese buyers, while the coal business also suffered industrial
disruption.
Gold and copper was down to ADollars 23.2m from ADollars 34.7m and diamonds
to ADollars 27.7m from ADollars 41.4m.
There is a unchanged dividend of 30 cents a share.

FT  31 AUG 94 / International Bonds: Spate of deals aimed at retail
investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A spate of bond issues aimed mainly at retail investors dominated the
eurobond market yesterday, but there was little sign of any return to the
market by institutional investors.
While the appetite for high-coupon paper among retail investors is clearly
intact, the market's ability to absorb institutionally-targeted offerings
could be tested in the next few weeks, as borrowers attempt to beat the
autumn rush.
'There is certainly a greater level of conversation about potential
transactions than there has been for some time, but we are still not seeing
any activity from big institutions,' said one syndicate manager.
For the first time, the Province of Ontario came to the Dutch guilder market
with a Fl 500m offering of 10-year bonds, priced to yield 45 basis points
above the 10-year 7 1/4 per cent Dutch government bond.
Lead manager ABN Amro said the deal was successful, with the bonds placed
predominantly with Dutch institutional investors, although it reported some
demand from retail investors in other European countries.
AT&amp;T tapped the Ecu market with an Ecu150m issue of five-year bonds, priced
to yield 6 basis points above the five-year 6 per cent French government
bond.
The issue was well received, lead manager Paribas Capital Markets said,
particularly because the coupon of 8 per cent was the highest seen in the
Ecu sector since February 1993.
However, some syndicate managers attacked the pricing as being too
aggressive.
The deal was mainly targeted at continental European retail investors,
Paribas said, and the proceeds have been swapped into floating-rate US
dollars.
Three banks took advantage of the attractive swap rates still available in
the Italian lira market, launching new issues totalling more than L500bn.
Swiss Bank Corporation and Morgan Guaranty tapped the short end of the
market, where the yield curve is particularly steep. Both three-year deals
offer coupons of 11 3/8 per cent and are likely to appeal to investors in
Switzerland and the Benelux region.
Recent three-year deals for General Electric Capital Corporation and
Rabobank have rallied half a point since they were launched last week.
Italian bank Cariplo launched a slightly longer-dated L150bn five-year deal,
which dealers said was likely to meet good demand from domestic investors.

Royal Oak Mines, the Canadian gold producer, has withdrawn its offer for
rival Lac Minerals, Reuter reports from Vancouver.
Royal Oak started the bidding war for Lac on July 7 with a hostile takeover
offer, subsequently increasing its bid to CDollars 5 and two of its shares
for each Lac share. However, American Barrick, another Canadian gold
producer, last week secured the support of the Lac board for its offer of
CDollars 5 and 0.325 of its shares for each Lac share.
Royal Oak will tender its 3.78m Lac shares, acquired before Royal Oak
launched its bid, to the American Barrick offer.

shake-up

<TEXT>
The US arm of Olympia &amp; York moved yesterday to try to block an attempt by
the administrator of its Canadian parent to frustrate the restructuring of
its Dollars 5bn debts.
O&amp;Y (USA)'s plan to complete its debt restructuring this year was thrown
into doubt last Friday, when it emerged that the administrator of O&amp;Y
Developments in Canada had moved to fire two of the subsidiary's directors.
The Canadian parent, which filed for bankruptcy in 1992, owns 80 per cent of
the US company's equity. The move to sack the directors was seen as an
attempt to frustrate the US restructuring talks.
The board of O&amp;Y (USA) resolved yesterday to contest the firings of Mr
Richard Shinn, its chairman, and Mr Willard Butcher, the chairman of its
finance committee.
The relationship between the US subsidiary and its parent is governed by a
protocol drawn up last year by Mr Cyrus Vance, a former US secretary of
state. Under this agreement, the administrators' actions regarding the
subsidiary can be challenged in US courts by the US company.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Trans-Natal Coal and Rand-coal, two of South Africa's biggest coal
companies, plan to merge, creating the third largest privately-owned coal
producer in the world.
The new company will have assets of R4.3bn (Dollars 615m) and a turnover of
R3.4bn on annual sales of 58m tonnes. The combined market capitalisation of
the two producers is R5.5bn.
The deal was announced yesterday with the annual results of Trans-Natal's
parent company, mining house Gencor. Mr Brian Gilbertson, Gencor chairman,
said the new company, which will temporarily be known as Mergeco, would
benefit from synergies in management and marketing.
The announcement follows widespread speculation that Randcoal's controlling
shareholder, life assurer Old Mutual, was considering bids for the company.
Other interested parties were thought to include South African mining houses
Anglovaal and Gold Fields and oil and chemical producer Sasol, as well as
Broken Hill Proprietary, the Australian mining group.
The decision signals the demise of Randcoal parent Rand Mines, once one of
South Africa's premier mining houses, as an independent company. The group
was unbundled from conglomerate Barlow Rand last December and its former
gold-producing subsidiary, Randgold, was in effect taken over by a
consortium operating through rival mine First Wesgold only two weeks ago.
The merger involves no cash and will be financed through Randcoal, which
will acquire the operating business of Trans-Natal by issuing 108 shares for
every 100 Trans-Natal shares. Minorities will be offered Trans-Natal shares
in exchange for Randcoal shares. Rand Mines will not accept the offer and
will distribute the Randcoal shares to its shareholders.
Gencor will have shareholder and management control of the new company; Mr
John Hall, Randcoal chairman, will be its chairman.
In its first results since unbundling, Gencor reported profits for the 10
months ending in June, lifting attributable earnings by 2.1 per cent to
R625m. This was up from its pro-forma figures of R613m for the year to
August 1993.
Operating income rose 32.9 per cent to R630m from R474m on the strength of
improved gold, ferro-alloys and titanium earnings, but investment income
dropped 67.5 per cent to R77m from R237m on a combination of lower cash
balances and lower interest rates.

Manufacturer Life of Canada, the personal life insurance group, is buying
the domestic group life and health business of Confederation Life.
The deal, signed with Confederation's liquidator, will give Manulife about
15 per cent of the domestic group market, up from 3 per cent and taking
premium income to about CDollars 1.25bn (USDollars 913m) from CDollars 250m.
Confederation's group business is mainly with corporations, including some
of the country's biggest. Confederation was seized by federal regulators on
August 11 after being caught in the commercial property market collapse. Its
profitable UK unit was bought by Sun Life Canada and the US group business
by Great-West.
Mr Dominic d'Alessandro, Manulife president, said: 'We're buying something
four times our size. It includes expertise, systems and people. We become a
credible player in this market overnight.'
Manulife, with CDollars 40bn assets, is Canada's second biggest life
insurer. Last year it earned CDollars 187.3m on total premium income of
CDollars 4.5bn.

AT&amp;T Global Information Solutions, formerly NCR, plans to withdraw from the
semiconductor market and is seeking a buyer for its NCR microelectronic
products division.
While the company would not estimate a market value for the operations, it
said it was prepared to negotiate aggressively with suitable potential
buyers for a speedy transaction.
Its decision to sell the semiconductor operations followed a business
portfolio analysis. 'It no longer fits strategically with our business
plan,' a spokesman said.
NCR was acquired by AT&amp;T in 1991 and renamed AT&amp;T Global Information
Solutions this year. The NCR semiconductor operation has continued to
operate independently rather than being integrated with AT&amp;T's existing
semiconductor operations.
AT&amp;T's microelectronic division, which had estimated 1993 sales of more than
Dollars 1bn, is not affected by the sale, the company said.
With sales last year of Dollars 372m, the NCR division employs almost 2,000
people at two semiconductor plants in Colorado as well as a plant in
Wichita, Kansas, making personal computer circuit boards, and Utrecht, in
the Netherlands, where there is a wireless data communications product line.
The division is profitable and its sales have been growing at about 25 per
cent per year, the company said.
Morgan Stanley has been retained to find a buyer.

FT  31 AUG 94 / International Company News: Dark clouds obscure Disney's
star - A difficult year could get even tougher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year is rapidly shaping up to be Walt Disney's 'annus horribilus'. In
the past eight months, the US entertainment group has endured a string of
setbacks.
They have included:
the loss of the company's highly-regarded president, Mr Frank Wells, in a
helicopter accident in April;
the temporary incapacitation, following emergency heart bypass surgery, of
its chairman, Mr Michael Eisner;
a politically embarrassing tussle with historians over plans to build a new
Disney theme park near Civil War battlefields in Virginia;
another costly financial reorganisation of Euro Disney and declining
attendance at its US theme parks;
and a series of disappointing performances from its live-action (as opposed
to animated) movies.
While the group has scored some successes at the box office, most notably
the triumph of its animated film The Lion King, a cloud appears to have
followed Disney around all year.
Last week, the company suffered another serious blow when Mr Jeffrey
Katzenberg, the widely-respected film executive who helped turn Disney's
moribund movie division into the most profitable studio in Hollywood,
announced he would be leaving the company when his contract expires at the
end of September.
Mr Katzenberg is departing because Mr Eisner would not give him Mr Wells'
old job as president. Although Mr Katzenberg had hankered after a bigger
management role at Disney, and had his sights on succeeding his long-time
mentor as chairman, Mr Eisner did not feel the studio chief had the right
credentials to be the number two.
Although Disney moved quickly to offset the impact of the loss - appointing
a new studio chief from within and unveiling a restructuring of the film
entertainment division - nagging questions remain.
Can Mr Eisner, who relied so heavily upon the late Mr Wells' support and
counsel, run Disney single-handed? Who, if anyone, is best-placed to succeed
Mr Eisner as chairman? And will Disney's hugely profitable animated films
unit prove as successful without Mr Katzenberg at the helm?
Disney has been quick to rebuff suggestions that Mr Eisner needs help
running the company. An experienced lawyer and negotiator, the 62-year old
Mr Wells played a crucial management role at the company, overseeing
Disney's day-to-day operations as well as helping to build its longer-term
strategies. Yet Mr Eisner, who described Mr Wells as 'the glue that held the
place together', has chosen not to replace him.
Instead, the Disney chairman has taken on the additional post of president,
and passed on many of the administrative duties to Mr Sanford Litvack, head
of the company's legal and human resources departments, and now its chief of
operations.
Mr Wells' deal-making skills, however, are likely to be missed, especially
as Disney faces some tough decisions, such as how to position itself on the
information superhighway, and whether to move aggressively into the
broadcast television business by acquiring a US network.
If Mr Eisner's decision not to appoint a new president raised only a few
eyebrows in the first few months after Mr Wells' death, it is now being
questioned widely following Mr Eisner's heart problems. Although his doctors
say he will make a full recovery, speculation about the succession issue
will not die down, and is likely to intensify now that Mr Katzenberg is
leaving.
The company, however, is sticking to its line that Disney's management team
is deep enough to provide Mr Eisner with all the support he requires.
Mr Raymond Watson, a Disney board member and former chairman of the company,
says there is no need to anoint a successor to Mr Eisner just yet. 'You
don't decide who is going to replace a 52-year old CEO when that person's
contract has another five years to go.'
Mr Watson also insists Mr Eisner's decision not to appoint a new president
should not be second-guessed. 'Who is the right person, or persons, who can
do the kind of things that Frank Wells did? That's a call Michael Eisner has
to make.
'This has a lot to do with the situation with Jeffrey Katzenberg. Jeffrey
Katzenberg was an outstanding executive in his field. But the question was:
would he be as effective in a role that is essentially complementary to
Michael Eisner? Michael decided he wouldn't. And I agreed with him on that.'
Another who agrees with that decision is Mr Christopher Dixon, an
entertainment industry analyst with the Wall Street firm PaineWebber. He
believes the restructuring of Disney's film entertainment division announced
last week will make Mr Eisner's job easier.
The restructuring involved splitting the film entertainment division in two.
Disney's highly-successful television business and its nascent
telecommunications operations will now be run as a separate unit by Mr
Richard Frank, who had been head of television at Disney's studio arm.
The remainder - the motion pictures production and distribution business -
will be run by Mr Joe Roth, formerly head of Disney's Caravan Pictures
offshoot, whose chief task will be to revitalise the lacklustre live-action
films unit.
These changes, say Mr Dixon, are part of a process of turning Disney into a
more decentralised company. Its individual businesses - theme parks, films,
television, music, merchandising, and now telecommunications - have grown so
fast it now makes sense to split them up, and to have each run by their own
specialist managements.
These are changes that other large, diversified entertainment groups, such
as Time Warner and Viacom, have gone through, says Mr Dixon. For Disney, the
PaineWebber analyst says, 'the restructuring goes a long way to helping push
management down into the divisions.'
While the changes in the film division should give Mr Eisner more time to
concentrate on Disney's longer-term strategies, he will have to keep a close
eye on the company's most profitable unit - the animated film operation -
when Mr Katzenberg leaves.
Although the outgoing studio chief earned much of the credit for reviving
the animated films business, company insiders now say Mr Roy Disney, the
founder's nephew, played as crucial a role as anyone in producing
blockbusters like Aladdin and The Lion King. Analysts believe that with Mr
Disney at the helm of animation, Disney's long run of successes should
continue.
Breathing new life into the theme parks, sustaining the success of the
animation films and reviving the live-action pictures, plotting Disney's
course on the information-superhighway: these are some of the biggest tasks
now facing Mr Eisner and his top lieutenants.
If 1994 has been a difficult year so far, the next 12 months could prove
even tougher.

<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft, the troubled German metals and engineering group, is to
raise almost CDollars 460m (USDollars 336m) from the sale of its controlling
stake in Metall Mining, the international mining group based in Canada.
The German group's 40.7m shares in Metall will be bought for CDollars 11.25
each by an underwriting consortium before being sold.
The deal marks the end of complex negotiations between Metallgesellschaft
and Metall which involved several other companies with interests at stake,
and a further stage in the restructuring of the German group.
The main stumbling block was Metall's 35 per cent stake in Norddeutsche
Affinerie, which operates a large copper smelter in northern Germany.
Metallgesellschaft is to buy back this holding for CDollars 152m in
accordance with its contract with the other shareholders in Norddeutsche,
MIM Holdings and Degussa.
Under this arrangement, Metallgesellschaft was obliged to take back the
stake if it ceased to control Metall.
Metallgesellschaft is to pay CDollars 40m in cash and the balance, covered
by an interest-bearing promissory note, is to be paid by the end of December
next year.
Metall said yesterday that it planned to file a prospectus with Canadian
securities authorities to qualify the shares previously held by the German
group for sale to the public in Canada.
The stock will also be sold in Europe and distributed through private
placements in the US.

FT  31 AUG 94 / International Company News: American Airlines seeks Dollars
1bn cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
American Airlines yesterday announced plans to reduce its annual expenses by
Dollars 1bn, making it the latest US carrier to embark on a severe
cost-cutting programme in an attempt to ensure long-term profitability.
The big US airlines are suffering from damaging fare wars in their home
market. Last year, AMR, American's parent group, reported a loss of Dollars
110m and recorded total operating expenses of more than Dollars 15bn.
A project to streamline American's headquarters management and
administrative staffs was unveiled yesterday by Mr Robert Crandall,
American's chairman, who said the carrier wanted to reduce annual labour
costs by Dollars 750m and other expenses by Dollars 250m.
Mr Crandall did not provide details on how the savings would be realised,
but said a team of executives would spend the next four to five months
searching for ways to streamline management and staff support functions.
American has been cutting its management wage bill for the past two years,
but believes further job reductions are necessary, both in the management
and union workforce. The key to American's cost-cutting programme, as at
other airlines, lies in negotiating an agreement with employee unions.
The carrier is following other leading US airlines, which have all
instituted programmes to lower their expenses.
In July, United Airlines was acquired by its employees in return for wage
cuts and other labour concessions worth Dollars 4.9bn.
Delta Air Lines recently introduced a plan to carve Dollars 2bn a year out
of its annual operating costs within the next three years, while USAir has
also launched a programme to cut Dollars 1bn in its annual operating costs
within the same period of time.
In spite of traffic growth and low fuel prices, the industry as a whole lost
Dollars 2.1bn last year because airlines were unable to charge fares high
enough to cover costs.
America said yesterday it had proposed wide-ranging changes to its contract
with the Allied Pilots' Association, which expires today.
However, the pilots' union has yet to respond to those proposals.
American also faces arbitration with the flight attendants' union later this
year, which it hopes will yield productivity improvements. It has held
preliminary talks with the union representing mechanics and ground employees
about revising their contract when it becomes due for amendment in March
next year.
The news of American's cost-cutting ambitions lifted the airline's share
price Dollars 1 1/4 to close at Dollars 59 1/2 on the New York Stock
Exchange yesterday.

FT  31 AUG 94 / International Company News: Alusuisse doubles income to
SFr95m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Alusuisse-Lonza, the aluminium, chemicals and packaging group, almost
doubled its net income in the first half to SFr95m (Dollars 72.5m) from
SFr49m, and forecast a similar increase in the second half.
Mr Theodor Tschopp, chief executive, said the group had already completed a
restructuring programme begun in 1991.
The aim of the restructure was to reduce Alusuisse's dependence on sales of
aluminium and chemical commodities and develop higher value-added businesses
over a five-year period.
Sales in the first half were ahead 21 per cent to SFr3.8bn and operating
income jumped 74 per cent to SFr265m.
These increases were attributed to the SFr1.1bn acquisition of the Canadian
Lawson-Mardon packaging group in January, improved productivity in core
businesses and the elimination of loss-makers.
The packaging division was the star performer, with operating income doubled
to SFr118m on sales up 97 per cent to SFr1.39bn, mainly because of the
inclusion of Lawson-Mardon figures.
Sales of the aluminium division advanced 5.7 per cent to SFr1.45bn but its
operating income surged 56 per cent to SFr72m, due to improved markets and
productivity.
The chemicals division's sales rose 2.8 per cent to SFr813m and operating
profits advanced 3.4 per cent to SFr91m, in spite of adverse exchange rate
trends.
Mr Tschopp said the group still had to improve its profitability
significantly to rank among international leaders.
It anticipated only minor acquisitions in the packaging division to round
out its position, while growth in the aluminium division would come through
alliances.
An important acquisition in the chemicals division in the medium term was
likely, but first, the balance sheet would be gradually strengthened through
retentions.
The annual dividend, cut by nearly 30 per cent in 1990, would 'at least' be
maintained this year, Mr Hans Jucker, chairman, said.

Bank of Nova Scotia, Canada's fourth-biggest bank, lifted third-quarter net
profit to CDollars 198m (USDollars 141m), or 80 cents a share, up 8.2 per
cent from CDollars 183m, or 77 cents, a year earlier.
Return on equity was 13.91 per cent, against 14.39 per cent. However, the
bank recorded a 12.6 per cent rise in net interest income, due to strong
growth in commercial and mortgage lending and better overseas markets.
Other income was up 20.4 per cent, though expenses rose 18.5 per cent due to
the absorption of Montreal Trust, the Canadian trust company.
Annual provision for credit losses was CDollars 567m at July 31, unchanged
from the previous quarter.
Net profit for the nine-month period was CDollars 277m, or 95 cents, down
from CDollars 520m, or CDollars 2.18, a year earlier.
The 1994 period included CDollars 305m special charges taken in the second
quarter following the acquisition of Montreal Trust.
Excluding these, net profit was CDollars 582m, up 12 per cent.

Two of Germany's leading retail groups yesterday forecast lower profits this
year, blaming falling disposable incomes and hot summer weather for the
setback.
Earnings in Karstadt's shops and department stores deteriorated in the first
half, although its NUR travel bureau business saw bookings and turnover rise
more than 20 per cent.
Kaufhof said sales on a like-for-like basis were lower than forecast and
down on last year. Neither group provided earnings details in interim
reports issued yesterday.
Turnover in Karstadt's shops and department stores fell 5 per cent after
adjustment for increased selling space, while its travel business rose 16
per cent. Mail order sales at the Neckermann subsidiary slipped almost 4 per
cent.
However, group turnover rose 28 per cent to DM12.3bn (Dollars 7.7bn) due to
the first-time inclusion of the Hertie concern. Average prices within the
group were 1.2 per cent higher than a year earlier.
Kaufhof, which has expanded vigorously, yesterday announced it was to
shuffle the management teams at the holding company and Kaufhof Warenhaus,
its department stores subsidiary.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Incentive, the Swedish industrial and investment group controlled by the
Wallenberg family, yesterday reported a 45 per cent increase in underlying
first-half profits to SKr395m (Dollars 50.6m).
The performance, reflecting improved market conditions and greater
efficiency, was achieved on a 21 per cent rise in sales to SKr6.96bn.
Mr Mikael Lilius, president, said all the group's businesses - embracing
medical technology, power, construction, transport, materials handling and
cameras - had contributed to the upturn, helped by healthy North American
and Asian markets and a European market 'characterised by definite
recovery'.
Orders rose 63 per cent to SKr9.99bn while group companies 'continued to
capture market share in most segments', he said.
A shift in group strategy in the last three months has seen the emphasis
move away from mature engineering business towards high-technology growth.
Gambro, a medical equipment specialist with annual sales of SKr10bn, has
been added to the group's business portfolio, while a 43 per cent stake in
Esab, the world's leading supplier of welding equipment, has been sold to
Charter, the UK industrial group.
Incentive gained its majority shareholding in Gambro through a SKr8bn bid
for Cardo, the investment group, which was finalised in June. Since then it
has sold about SKr1.8bn worth of equities from Cardo's SKr2.7bn portfolio.
The intention is to float what remains of Cardo when market volatility
subsides.
After including SKr1.4bn in proceeds from the Esab sale, Incentive has
driven net debt down by SKr3.2bn from SKr12.1bn at the end of June. A
SKr700m-SKr800m capital gain from the Esab disposal will be included in the
company's second-half figures.

The Axel Springer publishing group yesterday reported a 62 per cent increase
in net profits to DM52m (Dollars 33.1m) for the six months to the end of
June.
Sales rose 1.2 per cent to DM1.7bn. The group said most of the advance was
due to cost-cutting and strong earnings growth in the Bild newspaper
business.
Costs of materials fell 5 per cent and labour costs were trimmed by 0.8 per
cent in the period, it added.
Advertising revenues rose almost 3 per cent, led by a good performance from
Bild.
Overall newspaper sales rose 4.5 per cent, but magazines fell 3.5 per cent
as increased competition affected radio and television listings
publications.
Rheinmetall Berlin, the German munitions and engineering group, said it
expected parent company earnings to be flat in 1994, but made no forecast on
group earnings, Reuter reports from Dusseldorf.
In 1993, Rheinmetall's parent company made a net profit of DM19.2m and paid
a dividend of DM7 per ordinary share and DM8 per preferred share.

<TEXT>
Mr Christian Blanc, chairman of Air France, the loss-making airline, has
appointed Mr Steven Wolf, former head of United Airlines, the US carrier, as
an adviser to help him implement his cost-cutting strategy.
The appointment of Mr Wolf, who orchestrated a rationalisation and recovery
programme at United Airlines before engineering an employee buy-out earlier
this year, coincides with the launch of a reorganisation at Air France.
The French group, which made heavy losses in 1993 and was crippled by last
autumn's strike against a previous cost-cutting plan, will on Thursday
unveil a new corporate structure to separate international and domestic
operations.
Mr Blanc intends to shed 5,000 jobs over the next three years, to reduce the
Air France fleet and to implement a pay freeze.
Financial analysts welcomed the arrival of Mr Wolf, who is a
highly-experienced airline executive. He held posts at American Airlines,
Pan Am and Continental, as well as United.
However, the Air France unions yesterday criticised his appointment. The
CFDT, one of the largest unions, condemned the decision to appoint 'an icon
of airline deregulation' to the state-controlled airline. The union said Mr
Wolf was the 11th external senior appointment to Air France since the
announcement of the rationalisation, and described such hirings as
'shocking' at a time of job losses.

<TEXT>
General Electric of the US yesterday said it would purchase Lindner Licht,
the lighting subsidiary of Lindner, the German-based light-bulb maker.
The purchase, for an undisclosed sum, follows the collapse of a planned
merger between Philips Lighting (Netherlands) and Lindner after Germany's
Federal Cartel Office rejected the takeover on the grounds that it would
strengthen Philips's dominant position in the German market.
'This acquisition of Lindner provides GE with the opportunity to expand our
business in the strategically important German market,' said Mr Charles
Piepler, head of GE Lighting Europe.
GE said it hoped to increase its market share in Germany from 9 per cent.
Lindner holds a 6 per cent share of the lighting market. Last year's
turnover of the German lighting bulb market totalled DM600m (Dollars 375m).
Lindner, which will sell its licensing brand, trademarks and distribution
facilities to GE, yesterday said the GE purchase would help expand the
company.
'GE will provide the necessary resources and lighting expertise,' said Mr
Horst Hochreuther, managing director of Lindner.
The announcement confirms GE's determination to increase its global presence
in the lighting market.

British Petroleum yesterday announced one of its biggest discoveries in
recent years with the disclosure of a major new natural gas field in
Colombia.
The field, named Volcanera, will more than double Colombia's gas reserves.
Although its potential is still being assessed, the company has estimated
recoverable reserves of five trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 250m
barrels of condensate, a naturally occuring gasoline.

FT  31 AUG 94 / UK Company News: RJB Mining achieves 23% growth to Pounds
6.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RJB Mining, the coal group, yesterday pressed its case for taking over all
five British Coal mining regions as it reported a 23 per cent improvement in
interim profits.
Mr Richard Budge, chief executive, said there was a lot of support for a
unitary coal company in the UK because it could provide a higher level of
investment, and industrial relations would be better.
Mr Budge said the board had not yet decided finally on what it would bid
for. However, the expectation in the market was that it would put in a
tender for all five regions.
RJB is considered one of the few potential bidders capable of raising the
finance to take over all of British Coal's working mines. However, there
would be considerable poli-tical obstacles to overcome because the
government is thought to favour competition in coal.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to June 30 amounted to Pounds 6.82m,
against Pounds 5.55m last time, achieved on turnover up from Pounds 37.7m to
Pounds 49m.
Earnings per share were 10.9p, against a pro-forma 11p in 1993, and an
interim dividend of 5.2p (5p) is declared.
Coal production was 1.34m tonnes, up from 980,000, with underground mines
contributing 296,000 tonnes.
Mr Budge said the three deep mines recently leased from British Coal were on
target to produce 2m tonnes when in full production next year.
RJB had identified markets for the foreseeable future for all the coal it
produces, he said.
Monckton Coke &amp; Chemical, bought in March, contributed Pounds 600,000 to
group profits.
COMMENT
These are sound results for a company readying itself for life after British
Coal. By opening three deep mines and increasing its licensed opencast
operations, the company should within 18 months be able to generate at least
80 per cent of profit from sources that are not directly depen-dent on
British Coal or its successors. Some 18 months ago that figure was just 20
per cent. If all continues to go to plan, the transformation will mean that
RJB can grow profits comfortably even if it does not succeed in winning the
ownership of any of British Coal's five regions. That, together with results
at the top end of expectations, helps explain why the shares continued to
rise yesterday on top of recent advances. Assuming profits next year of
Pounds 18.2m, the shares are trading on a prospective multiple of 16.
Progress in the immediate future may be restrained by the British Coal bids
and the near certainty that, with gearing already at 65 per cent, an issue
of shares would be needed if the company's bids are successful.

from 31.93p to 35.23p at the half year ended June 30, a fall from 36.67p on
December 31 1993.
The results for the half year are dominated by the agreed takeover of NMC by
Britton Group, with London Finance realising most of its investment in cash
on July 4.
The sale of the investment was taken as an exceptional item of Pounds 4.43m

Compel Group, the computer systems and services company, yesterday announced
a sharp increase in full year profits ahead of its flotation next month.
Pre-tax profits more than trebled from Pounds 604,000 to Pounds 2.06m as the
group benefited from a wide-ranging restructuring in the year to June 30.
Mr Neville Davis, chairman and chief executive, said the outsourcing and
consultancy businesses had grown strongly following the shake-up, which saw
staff numbers cut by 14 per cent to 227.
Launching the pathfinder prospectus, he added: 'Overheads have been cut but
we need to raise fresh funds to continue growing the business.'
The company hopes to raise about Pounds 5m of new money from the flotation,
involving the placing of shares worth about Pounds 11m.

Inishtech, the packaging and labels group, reported profits of IPounds 3.9m
(Pounds 3.85m) before tax for the six months to June 30, against IPounds
3.6m.
The 8 per cent increase was achieved on turnover ahead 18 per cent to
IPounds 31.8m (IPounds 27m), including a contribution of IPounds 1.99m from
acquisitions - six over the past 12 months which currently achieve combined
annual sales of some IPounds 7m.
Mr Thomas Toner, chairman, said that the group's UK-based companies
performed satisfactorily but warned that a disappointing showing from Label
Art, the Dublin-based self-adhesive label offshoot, would 'have a
restricting effect' on the trading outcome in the second half. Sales at
Label Art declined 13 per cent on a year-on-year basis, following the loss
of a contract with its largest customer.
The interim dividend goes up 10 per cent to 2.75p, payable from earnings of
16.8p (15.9p) per share.
Some 70 per cent of the issued capital is held by James Crean, the Irish
industrial holding company.

Improving demand for most of its products helped Clondalkin, the

pre-tax profits from IPounds 4.64m to IPounds 6.23m (Pounds 6.15m) in the

The increase was achieved on turnover up from IPounds 74.3m to IPounds

dividend is raised to 2.017p (1.834p).
Irish operations had benefited from corrective actions taken last year,
while more buoyant conditions in the UK had helped the profits advance, said
Mr Domhnall McCullough, chairman.
In the US, the flexible packaging and business forms companies showed good
volume and profit growth, although commercial printing continued to be a
difficult sector and operations had been cut again, he added.

FT  31 AUG 94 / UK Company News: High renewal rate helps Maid double to
Pounds 440,000
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Maid, the online business information supplier, more than doubled pre-tax
profits to Pounds 439,832, against Pounds 207,108, in the first half of the
year.
Turnover rose 53 per cent to Pounds 3.97m (Pounds 2.6m).
The market anticipated the improvement, however, and the shares were
unchanged at 74p, having moved up from 60p over the past few weeks.
The company joined the main market at 110p in March, but saw its share price
slide almost immediately reflecting worries about competition for customers
and for sources of data available to the company.
Its core services - Researchline, Newsline, Companyline and Brokerline  -
provide business information in a variety of formats.
Yesterday the company said that usage of its information services had
increased by 68 per cent over the same period in 1993. New subscribers
numbered more than 130 and renewal of subscriptions was more than 85 per
cent.
Earnings per share were 0.39p, against 0.24p. There is net cash of Pounds
10.7m.
Mr Michael Mander, chairman, said that more than 50 companies were using a
version of Maid designed to run under Lotus Notes, the leading software for
groups. He also said that a version running under Microsoft Windows was
expected to be launched in the first quarter of 1995.

FT  31 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Macfarlane (Clansman) rises 33% - Cash pile
currently at Pounds 20m and further acquisitions in the offing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Macfarlane Group (Clansman), the Glasgow-based packaging group, lifted
pre-tax profits by almost 33 per cent in the first half of 1994.
Lord Macfarlane of Bearsden, chairman, said the economic climate 'had gently
been getting better' and that the trend was still upward. A packaging
company with all its activities confined to the UK was a reliable
bellwether, he added.
Pre-tax profits grew to Pounds 7.09m (Pounds 5.35m) on turnover up 13 per
cent at Pounds 52.5m (Pounds 46.3m). Interest receivable expanded to Pounds
573,000 (Pounds 363,000), though, with current low rates, Lord Macfarlane
admitted that the group's Pounds 20m cash pile could be used better than
remaining on deposit.
Cash balances in March had stood at Pounds 21m. Capital expenditure totalled
Pounds 4m in the first half, with another Pounds 4m pencilled in for the
second.
In August Macfarlane bought Centurion Packaging for Pounds 5.5m in cash and
shares. This added the manufacturing of film products for packaging to the
existing merchanting activities. Lord Macfarlane said he was seeking further
acquisition possibilities, probably of a similar size to Centurion.
As well as packaging, which accounts for about 75 per cent of sales, the
group has two other divisions - plastic moulding and development. The former
makes bottle closures for whisky distillers and closures for the detergents
industry.
Within development is a self-adhesive labels business, which 'makes a lot of
money' and to which Lord Macfarlane admits to being sentimentally attached,
and a contract furniture merchanting business. Acknowledging it was an
oddity within a packaging company, he said it occupied 'a good site in the
centre of Glasgow' and he was 'waiting for a good fairy' to show interest.
He expected to be able to sell it within the next two years.
The interim dividend is lifted to 1.7p (1.44p), payable from earnings of
6.14p (4.74p).

FT  31 AUG 94 / International Company News: Smurfit in IPounds 20m Austrian
purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jefferson Smurfit, the Irish packaging company, is injecting IPounds 20.5m
(Pounds 20.2m) into an Austrian paper producer, further strengthening its
hold on the European corrugated market.
Smurfit, Europe's leading producer of corrugated paper with 10 per cent of
the market, yesterday announced it would acquire 27.5 per cent of
Nettingsdorfer Beteilingungs-Aktlengesellschaft, the fourth largest
producer.
Earlier this month Smurfit announced plans to buy Cellulose du Pin, the
paper and packaging interests of Saint Gobain of France, for Pounds 670m.
The latest purchase is Smurfit's first step into the eastern European and
German markets.
Mr Dermot Smurfit, chairman and chief executive of Smurfit Continental
Europe, said the company intended to increase its stake in Nettingsdorfer to
more than 50 per cent through a further cash injection in the next two to
three years.
The move could leave Smurfit with two of the three European mills producing
kraft liner paper, a key component in corrugated manufacture.
Nettingsdorfer, a family-owned group quoted on the Austrian stock market,
produces 320,000 tonnes of paper. It has been lossmaking in recent years but
rising paper prices have helped it move back into profit in 1994 on a
monthly basis.
The group is heavily indebted, however, after investing some IPounds 120m in
its Austrian Kraft liner mill. Debt as a percentage of shareholders' funds
is estimated at about 400 per cent.
Mr Smurfit said his group had not been prepared to take on such debt. Any
further holding increase would depend in part on Nettingsdorfer cutting
borrowings, he said. The group is paying Sch310 (Pounds 18.17) per share,
against Friday's suspension price of Sch253.

FT  31 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Alliance &amp; Leicester advances 45%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alliance &amp; Leicester yesterday became the latest building society to report
a sharp increase in interim profits, primarily reflecting a steep drop in
provisions for bad and doubtful debts.
Pre-tax profits at the UK's fourth largest society rose by 45 per cent to
Pounds 134.4m (Pounds 92.6m) in the six months to June 30. Provisions fell
72 per cent to Pounds 18.8m (Pounds 67m).
The society does not have to publish interim results, but Mr Richard Pym,
finance director, said A&amp;L had decided to do so for the first time to
underline its accountability to its members.
In an intensely competitive market, it took an aggressive stance on mortgage
lending in the first half, more than doubling it to over Pounds 1bn.
But in a reflection of competition and a narrowing of interest margins, net
interest receivable slipped slightly to Pounds 265.6m (Pounds 270m). Other
income, including fees and charges, rose by 10 per cent to Pounds 225m
(Pounds 205.4m), largely as a result of higher profits from Girobank's
corporate cheque and cash handling business.
Mr Pym said A&amp;L was looking to develop further Girobank's relationship with
Post Office Counters, if - as expected - the government gave the operation
more commercial freedom.
Administrative expenses rose to Pounds 320.3m (Pounds 309.6m) and the
society also had exceptional expenses of Pounds 17.1m (Pounds 6.2m). The
cost-income ratio for the group, including Girobank, was 65 per cent - the
same as in the first half of 1993.
Mr Peter White, chief executive, said the general expenses included spending
on developing and launching the Alliance account, and that underlying costs
were flat.
He expected exceptional costs of restructuring and relocating, as part of
the group's strategic review, to be a continuing feature for the next couple
of years.
Against a background of an uncertain housing market, A&amp;L emphasised that it
was not dependent on mortgage lending for growth, but had other
opportunities, for example through greater cross-selling of financial
products to its 5m personal customers.

FT  31 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Reduced borrowings aid Quality Street
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Quality Street, the Glasgow-based company which describes itself as a
private sector landlord organisation, returned to the black with pre-tax
profits of Pounds 2m in the year to March 31 after two years of losses which
totalled Pounds 28m by 1993.
Nationwide Building Society became the majority shareholder in January,
controlling 75 per cent of the company after converting Pounds 50m of
lending into non-voting preference shares.
The rest of the company is owned by Mr Paul Mugnaioni, chairman and founder,
and the management.
As a result of the reduction in borrowing, interest payments fell from
Pounds 17.5m to Pounds 7.6m.
The company also benefited from the conversion of a deficit on asset
revaluation of Pounds 17.9m in 1993 into a surplus of Pounds 1.6m because of
the rise in the value of its properties.
Turnover, consisting largely of rental income, was Pounds 13.6m (Pounds
12.3m) and gross profit was Pounds 10.2m (Pounds 9.2m).
As part of the deal with Nationwide, Quality Street took over about 2,000
houses which Nationwide had repossessed. It is now refurbishing these
properties, scattered all over Britain, for rent. This will increase rental
income to about Pounds 22.5m by the end of 1995.

FT  31 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Guinness Peat drops 26% after Australian
setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Guinness Peat Group, the UK investment vehicle of Sir Ron Brierley, the New
Zealand entrepreneur, yesterday reported a 26 per cent fall in interim
profits after its Australian fund management and life assurance business ran
into losses.
Despite turnover ahead to Pounds 21.3m (Pounds 13m), pre-tax profits for the
six months to June 30 fell from Pounds 6.75m to Pounds 4.97m.
However, strong growth from the rest of the group, particularly the Brown
Shipley stockbroking side, and a sharp fall in the tax charge saw earnings
per share increase 43 per cent to 1.09p.
Tyndall Australia, in which GPG has a 52 per cent stake, swung from a Pounds
4.8m profit last time to losses of Pounds 1m. GPG blamed the decline on
falls in the Australian investment market during the first half and added
that the situation had now stabilised.
Mr Blake Nixon, executive director, said the group's attention would focus
on managing existing investments after its recent busy programme of
acquisitions and disposals. 'Although we will still be looking out for
investment opportunities, we will be concentrating on consolidation and
adding value to our existing portfolio,' he said.
Mr Nixon reiterated that the group would consider returning to the dividend
list next year - the last distribution was in 1990.

FT  31 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Buckingham faces Pounds 4m legal bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REG VAUGHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Buckingham International, the lossmaking property, hotels and nursing group,
yesterday said it faced a total bill of Pounds 4.3m after judgment was given
against the company last month in litigation with the former directors and
owners of Worldwide Dryers.
Buckingham, which also announced pre-tax losses cut from Pounds 62.5m, after
a Pounds 59.1m property provision, to Pounds 904,000 for the half year to
May 1, said the judgment was for two amounts - Pounds 3.31m and Pounds
368,722, plus estimated costs of Pounds 600,000.
Sir David Hardy, chairman, said that after taking legal advice, an appeal
had been lodged against the judgment of Pounds 3.31m which resulted in a
stay of execution until October 17. He said it was intended to seek a
further stay until the appeal was heard.
However, the Pounds 368,722 was now liable to be paid and as the company was
unable to pay at this stage it was in talks with judgment creditors with a
view to them participating in a bank support plan.
Sir David said the group's future was dependent among other things on the
stay of judgment being obtained, the discussions with judgment creditors
being satisfactorily concluded and agreeing an extension to the support plan
which ends on October 31.
Turnover slipped to Pounds 20.7m (Pounds 24.4m) including Pounds 1.96m
(Pounds 5.13m) from discontinued activities. Interest charges were cut by
Pounds 1m to Pounds 3.2m. Losses per share came through at 0.8p (51.9p).
The shares closed unchanged at 3p.

FT  31 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Strong second half leaves Verity at Pounds
1m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After a strong second half which consolidated its return to the black at the
interim stage, Verity, the manufacturer and distributor of Wharfedale and
Mission loudspeakers, reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.01m for the year
to end-June.
The outcome compared with a deficit of Pounds 4.27m and was achieved on
turnover of Pounds 24.1m (Pounds 16.2m).
The directors attributed the 'encouraging result' to a turnround in
Wharfedale's lossmaking operations and the continuing growth of Mission.
The interest charge was reduced to Pounds 379,000 (Pounds 870,000). Earnings
per share emerged at 0.4p (5p losses).

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Dixon Motors, the acquisitive dealership chain which moved up from the USM
in June, saw pre-tax profit for the six months to June 30 increase from
Pounds 642,000 to Pounds 3.37m, with a Pounds 2.44m exceptional contribution
from discontinued mining operations.
The group came to the USM last year after reversing into Plateau Mining; the
exceptional resulted from the disposal of mining interests in Zimbabwe.
As a result of the change in the nature of the business and a corresponding
change in the year end, comparisons are from the pro forma accounts for the
six months ended June 30 1993.
Turnover increased by 55 per cent to Pounds 44.8m (Pounds 29m), with
acquisitions contributing Pounds 364,000. Operating profit was ahead at
Pounds 1.21m (Pounds 766,000); acquisitions contributed Pounds 61,000
against a Pounds 38,000 loss from discontinued operations last time.
Earnings per share came to 25.7p (4.2p). The interim dividend is increased
by 67 per cent to 1.25p (0.75p).

FT  31 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Israel Fund assets fall
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Net assets per share of the Israel Fund fell by 12.5 per cent to 83.54 cents
(54p) between the trust's launch on March 17 and July 31 this year.
Mr Michael Connors, manager of the trust at BZW Investment Management, said
the results reflected a difficult year so far for the Israeli stock market.
It has been hit by inflation worries, interest rate rises, the proposed
imposition of a capital gains tax, and concerns over progress in the Middle
East peace process.
When the Israel Fund was launched, the main Tel Aviv index stood at 208. By
May it had risen to a high of 229, but subsequently dropped to 149, and has
since recovered to about 184. Over the period March 17 to July 31, the
Mishtanim index fell by 14.1 per cent in dollar terms.
The trust, which is the first UK-listed investment trust to concentrate on
Israel, raised about Dollars 153m. Some two thirds is now invested, 80 per
cent of which is in companies listed on the Tel Aviv stock exchange, with
the remainder in Israeli companies listed on US stock exchanges.
Earnings were 0.19 cents.

FT  31 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Canadians consider launching offer for
HunterPrint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Quebecor, the Canadian publishing and forestry group, is considering making
an offer for HunterPrint, the lossmaking UK printer.
The move follows almost two years of talks between the debt-burdened British
company and the Montreal-based newspaper publisher, North America's second
largest commercial printing business.
Mr Charles Cavell, president of Quebecor, said the group was keen to expand
its presence in Europe, but warned that a bid could be derailed by problems
at HunterPrint.
'There are a number of issues which are unacceptable to us. It's up to
HunterPrint to find a solution.'
The Corby-based company admitted that several pre-conditions had to be
resolved and warned that any offer could be at a discount to last Friday's
9p closing share price - equivalent to a market capitalisation of Pounds
5.22m.
The shares, which shed a further 1 1/2 p to close at 7 1/2 p yesterday, have
halved in value since February when the group's auditors expressed
'fundamental uncertainty' over its prospects as a going concern.
Net borrowings, meanwhile, have reached Pounds 19.4m against shareholders'
funds of Pounds 11.8m.
City analysts, who expect pre-tax losses to fall from Pounds 3.2m to about
Pounds 2m this year, blamed the group's problems on onerous contracts with
publishers such as Associated Newspapers and Mirror Group Newspapers.
In an attempt to reduce its debt burden, the company earlier this month sold
Hardy Printers, its only active subsidiary, to a manage-ment buy-out team
for Pounds 1.85m.
At the time, the company said that even after the disposal the group would
'only have sufficient working capital for its current requirements through
the continued support of its existing bankers'.

FT  31 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Further disposal at Heron
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Heron International, which is moving into the final stages of a proposed
buy-out by Mr Steven Green, the US investor, yesterday sold off one of its
last two trading businesses, Heron Distribution.
The deal, achieved at below analysts' valuations, leaves Mr Gerald Ronson's
once diverse Heron group with its car dealership, a property portfolio, and
a mountain of debt.
Heron announced in early June that it had selected Mr Green's HNV
Acquisitions as its preferred buyer, but it has since been silent, and the
value of its bonds has fallen amid speculation that the deal might fall
through.
The delay is because of the complexity of a deal which has to prove
acceptable to more than 80 banks and also its bond holders. However, the
release of the formal offer document is expected imminently.
The company has been pursuing an aggressive disposal programme, which has
included the recent sales of its Suzuki motor distributorship, its
housebuilding business, and its service stations.
The disposal of Heron Distribution will leave the group with only one
remaining trading business, Heron Motor Group, which is also expected to be
sold. Heron Motor Group owns the HR Owen Rolls-Royce dealership, and also
the HMG and Hollingdrake businesses.
Heron Distribution is being sold to a management buy-out team led by
Granville Private Equity Managers, and will raise Pounds 12m for the parent
company. Already this year Heron has raised Pounds 31m from the sale of
Heron Homes, Pounds 44m from Heron Suzuki, and Pounds 33m from the sale of
seven properties, including its headquarters, to Derwent Valley Holdings.
Heron Distribution, which has been renamed Merlin Distribution, achieved a
turnover of Pounds 35m in the year to March 1994, but management said it had
been constrained by its parent's financial difficulties.
Mr Richard Morris, who will remain as managing director, said: 'Now that we
are able to operate on a level playing field we are very confident about our
ability to expand Merlin Distribution into one of the key players in the
contract distribution industry.'

FT  31 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Lombard Insurance beats forecast with
Pounds 9.14m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lombard Insurance, the recently floated provincial insurance group,
comfortably exceeded its prospectus profits forecast for the year to June.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 9.14m, compared with Pounds 8.65m forecast at
the time of its May flotation. It has switched its year-end from December to
June. In 1993 it made profits of Pounds 5.68m.
The shares closed 3p higher yesterday at 181p, compared with the 160p issue
price.
Despite growing competition for household insurance from direct insurance
companies, underwriting profits jumped from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 1.5m in
the six months to June.
Profits from personal motor insurance also rose strongly, from Pounds
700,000 to Pounds 1.4m.
Commercial insurance lines, however, remain the focus for expansion, and
there was a Pounds 700,000 profit from underwriting commercial policies in
1994, reversing previous losses.
Total gross written premiums were up from Pounds 79.4m to Pounds 93.8m. The
company has benefited from declining claims.
Continental, Lombard's previous owner, provided Pounds 38.9m to cover any
claims for policies written prior to the management buy-out in May 1993.
About Pounds 15m of this fund has been utilised, but Mr Andrew Laing,
managing director, predicted that a surplus would be available over the next
two years.
The forecast dividend of 1.58p is to be paid. Pro-forma earnings were 18.1p
per share.

<TEXT>
Cathay International Holdings, the London quoted investment company formerly
known as Stonehill, yesterday announced that net assets had risen from
Pounds 62.9m to Pounds 233.2m, following a series of investments in China
made last year.
Pre-tax profits for the year to March amounted to Pounds 469,000 (Pounds
264,000), however, the company received no meaningful contribution from
either of two substantial new assets, the Landmark Hotel in Shenzhen and the
Xiyuan Hotel in Beijing.
Last year, the company was transformed from a shell, containing the
Stonehill business park, into the holding company for those two hotels and a
related property development project.
Turnover during the year rose from Pounds 4.03m to Pounds 5.94m, and
operating profit amounted to Pounds 1.28m (Pounds 1.86m).
Losses per share emerged at 0.09p (0.066p). There is no dividend.
The company has eliminated the deficit on its profit and loss account, but
still owes Pounds 336,000 of preference share dividends. It has given no
timescale for reviving dividends.

rating

<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS

<TEXT>
SmithKline Beecham's planned Dollars 2.9bn (Pounds 1.87bn) purchase of the
consumer health operations of Sterling Winthrop could cost it its double-A
credit rating, potentially adding to the borrowing costs associated with the
deal.
Yesterday Standard &amp; Poor's, the US ratings agency, said it was reviewing
the Anglo-US group's credit standing and may downgrade it.
This follows a similar announcement by rival agency Moody's late on Monday,
after the Sterling deal was announced.
Both agencies currently accord SB their lowest double-A rating, AA-minus in
the case of S&amp;P and AA3 for Moody's.
A downgrade would take the company into the single-A category.
This could raise its debt costs, since many bond holders are restricted to
owning securities issued by companies or other entities with ratings of
double-A or above.

FT  31 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Astec continues to improve with 70% rise to
Pounds 7.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Astec (BSR), the Hong Kong-based and London-listed electronics company,
continued to improve its performance with a 70 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits and a 10 per cent rise in sales at the interim stage.
In the half year to June 24 pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 4.33m to Pounds
7.37m on turnover up from Pounds 136.4m to Pounds 150.3m.
Astec, 48.9 per cent owned by Emerson Electric of the US, claims to be the
world's largest supplier of power conversion products.
Mr George Tamke, chief executive, said the improvement was achieved by the
company's continued aggressive campaign to cut costs and drive down prices.
'We are continuing to move production from high cost to low cost countries
and to source more of our products in south-east Asia.'
He said 80 per cent of Astec's products were now sourced in south-east Asia,
compared with 60 per cent last year.
Earnings per share rose from 1.2p to 2.03p. An interim dividend of 0.40p
(0.25p) is declared.
Mr Tamke is stepping down as chief executive. He will be replaced by Mr
David Farr, formerly president of Emerson Electric Asia-Pacific.
COMMENT
It must be a measure of Mr Tamke's success that news of his departure as
chief executive knocked 2p off Astec's share price despite excellent
figures. But the shock should be short-lived as his replacement is from the
Emerson Electric stable. But how much more can Astec drive down costs and
what will be the knock-on effect of continued cuts in personal computer
prices? Already Astec is seeking to reduce its dependence on pc makers.
Benefits from improved margins should now become incremental but profit
forecasts of Pounds 21m for the full year suggest the group will continue to
report moderate growth. At 91 1/2 p the shares are trading on a prospective
p/e of more than 15 to 16. With the shares close to their 12-month high, the
new chief executive has a lot to live up to.

General Signal, the US electrical equipment manufacturer, is set to double
its sales with the all-stock acquisition of Cleveland-based Reliance
Electric.
The deal, valued at Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 844m), heralds a return to growth
through acquisition at General Signal, which has spent most of the 1990s
selling some of its businesses and reorganising others.
Both companies had sales of around Dollars 1.5bn last year, with General
Signal reporting after-tax profits of Dollars 89m and Reliance Dollars 15m.
General Signal, based in Stamford, Connecticut, once had interests extending
to semiconductors and transportation equipment but now specialises in
process and electrical control equipment and telecommunications.
The acquisition marks the final chapter in the changing ownership of
Reliance. Bought by energy group Exxon in 1980, the company was the subject
of a leveraged buy-out in 1986 before being taken public in 1992.
Since then Citicorp, which backed the buy-out and owned almost half of the
company's shares at one point, is thought to have taken its stake to below
20 per cent.
Reliance makes industrial motors, generators and transformers, and
telecommunications eqipment. Cost savings from merging the two companies'
operations would lead to an immediate enhancement in earnings per share next
year, said Mr Edmund Carpenter, General Signal's chairman and chief
executive.
The stock market remained sceptical and marked General Signal's shares down
by Dollars 1 3/4 to close at Dollars 35 1/2 .
In contrast, Reliance Electric's shares jumped Dollars 5 on the news, to
close at Dollars 25 7/8 .
General Signal said it would issue 0.739 of a share for every share in
Reliance Electric, equivalent to around 37m new General Signal shares.
The merger would give the company 'significant critical mass in our combined
core businesses', said Mr Carpenter.
Cost-savings would come from combining purchasing operations, cutting
overall general and administrative costs and merging individual operating
units, he added.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Volvo profits leap to Pounds 761m in first half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Volvo, Sweden's biggest manufacturing company, yesterday reported a leap in
first-half profits, confirming a recovery from recession that is fast
banishing the memory of the breakdown last December of its plans to merge
with France's Renault.
The group announced a pre-tax profit of SKr9.02bn (Pounds 761m) compared
with just SKr380m in the same period last year. The figure was inflated by a
capital gain of SKr4.08bn, but underlying profits were still far ahead of
the same stage last year, thanks to surging sales for Volvo cars and trucks,
favourable currency movements and the benefits of restructuring.
Operating profits reached SKr4.47bn. This included a SKr849m contribution
from BCP, the consumer products group fully taken over this year, but
followed an operating profit in the first half of 1993 of SKr166m. Volvo
said its second quarter group operating profit of SKr2.5bn, up from SKr355m
last time, was the highest in any quarter in Volvo's history.
The result will give the board installed after the collapse of the Renault
merger confidence to push ahead with its plan to concentrate on motor
industry operations and shed some SKr40bn worth of non-core assets built up
under Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar who quit in December.
The proceeds, combined with renewed profits flow, will help fund Volvo's big
product development costs, especially in cars.
In a rare interview in a Swedish newspaper at the weekend, Mr Gyllenhammar
bitterly criticised the new direction. But Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo's chief
executive, yesterday underscored his commitment to the strategy and implied
the board believed it had the full backing of the workforce.
Group sales in the first six months jumped to SKr75.67bn from SKr48.8bn,
partly due to a SKr10.1bn contribution from BCP and currency effects. But
Volvo said underlying sales were still 30 per cent higher than last time.
Unit car sales were up 20 per cent at 189,000, with sales rising fastest in
the US and Nordic countries, but sales were also ahead in Germany and Japan
despite falling markets. Car sales rose to SKr36.55bn from SKr27.02bn and
the car group swung to an operating profit of SKr1.47bn from a loss of
SKr70bn.
In the truck division, unit sales were up 37 per cent to 32,400 thanks
mainly to higher demand in Europe and Brazil. Sales rose to SKr24.23bn from
SKr17.59bn and operating profits jumped to SKr1.77bn from SKr61m.
The capital gain stemmed mainly from the SKr2.6bn sale of Volvo's
controlling holding in Cardo to Incentive, a Wallenberg family company.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Tiny Rowland faces his day of reckoning: Roland Rudd and
Robert Peston look back to 1973 to explain why Lonrho's great survivor will
find it harder to win this time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'In the best interests of the company, Mr Roland Rowland should cease to
hold the office of chief executive.'
Thus spoke the majority of Lonrho's board in 1973, but Mr Tiny Rowland
survived.
More than two decades, later Mr Rowland may face a similar motion from an
equally hostile board, following disclosures of what Mr Rowland costs the
company in salary, expenses and other costs under his direct control and the
sale of a film to a company connected to Libya.
At a board meeting tomorrow, Mr Dieter Bock, the German joint chief
executive of the international trading and mining group, may attempt to win
the majority vote of directors needed to strip Mr Rowland of his chief
executive title.
The issue which has brought the current battle to a head appears to be far
removed from the last attempt to topple Mr Rowland.
Mr Rowland's recent decision to sell a film on the bombing of Pan Am flight
103 over Lockerbie to an Egyptian company connected to Lafico, Libya's
trading arm, possibly breaching United Nations sanctions, has infuriated Mr
Bock's supporters.
But, in reality, the Pounds 200,000 Libyan sale has only brought hostilities
to a head. They have been been simmering for the past year between the two
joint chief executives whom Mr Rowland last year called 'indivisible'.
Mr Bock's main reason for wanting to get rid of Mr Rowland is strikingly
similar to those of the so-called 'straight eight' led by the then deputy
chairman, Sir Basil Smallpeice in 1973.
The majority of directors are now said to be shocked to discover that Mr
Rowland, who is 76 and has run Lonrho for 33 years, costs the company more
than Pounds 5.5m a year in salary, expenses and other costs under his direct
control.
A Financial Times analysis shows:
Mr Rowland's salary is more than Pounds 1.2m;
He receives almost Pounds 500,000 as a contribution to the costs of his two
homes, in Chester Square, London, and Hedsor Wharf in Buckinghamshire;
Lonrho's Gulfstream private jet costs about Pounds 2m a year in running and
finance costs;
About Pounds 200,000 is paid by Lonrho for the education of dependents of
African politicians and agents;
There is almost Pounds 1m of other personal business expenses related to the
winning of international business;
More than Pounds 300,000 is incurred in costs relating to employees who work
directly for Mr Rowland.
What is remarkable is that Mr Rowland should continue to be such a
substantial cost centre for the company 21 years after he was first
criticised for his lavish corporate lifestyle.
In 1973, the company owned Mr Rowland's house, and he lived in it rent free.
At the time, the board estimated that this represented implicit payments to
Mr Rowland of Pounds 300,000 in total since the house had been bought in the
late 1960s.
His business expenses were running at around Pounds 1m a year and the use of
his Mystere jet angered the majority of the board's directors as much as it
does today.
Disclosure of Mr Rowland's expenses during Lonrho's first boardroom battle,
as well as other revelations about the company, prompted the then UK prime
minister, Sir Edward Heath, to remark that 'it is an unpleasant and
unacceptable face of capitalism'.
Mr Rowland sought to justify the costs on the grounds that only by
entertaining African politicians in a lavish manner could the company
reinforce its business links with the continent.
He argued it would be 'disastrous for the company' if he was to relinquish
the role of chief executive. With more than 75 per cent of the group's
profits derived from Africa, he could with some force argue that he was
integral to the company's success.
No one has ever disputed Mr Rowland's contacts or ability to work with
African leaders.
But Lonrho in 1994 is a different company. Africa is no longer seen as so
important to its future. There is no longer the threat of the
nationalisation of Lonrho's African assets if the company was to remove Mr
Rowland as chief executive, as there was in the 1970s. Moreover, a greater
proportion of Lonrho's African earnings today comes from mines in Ghana and
South Africa, rather than general trading profits.
Mr Rowland also faces a more formidable opponent in Mr Bock than he did in
Mr Smallpeice. The German financier, owner of 18.8 per cent of the
com-pany's shares, has already swept out most of the old guard on the board
who supported Mr Rowland through thick and thin.
He has also succeeded in bringing in the first non-executives to the board
for more than two decades.
Out of the 13 directors on Lonrho's board Mr Rowland can count only on the
support of the chairman, Mr Rene Leclezio, who retires at the end of October
and Mr Robert Dunlop, who retires at the end of September.
One African director, Mr Sam Jonah from Ghana, may abstain in the event of a
vote to remove Mr Rowland as chief executive.
But the remaining nine, which include the two non-executives, may be as
united as their predecessors in wanting to strip Mr Rowland of his executive
powers.
If they succeed, Mr Rowland could try to appeal over their heads directly to
shareholders, as he did in the 1970s, by trying to call an extraordinary
general meeting. But this time he would have to find a sympathetic big
shareholder or buy another 3.5 per cent to take his shareholding up to the
10 per cent required to call an EGM. The last time he faced dismissal from
the board he owned about 20 per cent of the company.
Unlike 20 years ago, Mr Rowland can no longer count on the support of any
army of loyal shareholders. Investment institutions, most of them supportive
of Mr Bock, now control around 40 per cent of the shares.
The odds are therefore stacked heavily against Mr Rowland's continued
survival as joint chief executive. Indeed, if 75 per cent of the board were
against him, he could lose his place on the board altogether.
But as the first 'straight eight' experienced to their detriment, a majority
on Lonrho's board does not necessarily ensure victory against Mr Rowland. It
is likely to be a nerve-wracking 24 hours for the majority of Lonrho's
directors.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Euro Disney chief tries to calm market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Philippe Bourguignon, chairman of Euro Disney, the embattled leisure
group, yesterday sought to squash speculation about the company's
performance after further erratic trading in its shares.
Euro Disney's shares, which fell sharply on Friday and Monday, began the day
by plummeting in Paris to a record low of FFr7.55 from FFr8.40 at the
previous day's close. The shares, have been affected by concern about Euro
Disney's prospects and about the future of Walt Disney, its US parent
company.
Shares were suspended four times during the day before closing 8.33 per cent
up on the day at FFr9.10.
Mr Bourguignon, who on Monday asked Paris stock market authorities to
investigate the share price moves, said on French radio that the stock's
volatility was due to market sentiment. 'If observers come to certain
conclusions about us, that's their problem and their responsibility,' he
said. 'If it affects our share price, that's their fault.'
The Euro Disney chairman declined to comment on market speculation that the
EuroDisneyland theme park has been poorly attended this summer. In May, the
company confirmed that visitor levels in the first five months of the year
had been lower than during the same period of 1994.
Analysts are braced for another hefty loss at Euro Disney for the current
financial year to September 30 after last year's net deficit of FFr6.9bn.
Mr Bourguignon affirmed at the time of the restructuring that the group was
unlikely to come back into the black before its 1996 financial year.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Argyll sells 151 small stores to Spar for Pounds 19.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Argyll Group, the UK's third-largest food retailer, has sold 151 of its
smallest Lo-Cost and Presto supermarkets for Pounds 19.7m to a consortium of
five companies operating under the Spar banner.
The deal rids Argyll of most of its Lo-Cost and Presto stores smaller than
4,000 sq ft, allowing it to concentrate on larger stores operating under
those names and on the Safeway superstore chain.
The future of the Lo-Cost discount chain has been under review since May
when Argyll said operating profits in its Presto/Lo-Cost division had fallen
by 20 per cent to Pounds 40.7m in the year to April 2.
Analysts attributed much of the fall to Lo-Cost. It was hit by increased
price competition in the grocery sector, and particularly by the 'Price
Check' campaign launched in May 1993 by the Gateway group, now Somerfield.
Some 123 Lo-Cost and 28 Presto stores are being sold. Fixtures and fittings
and goodwill have been sold for Pounds 10.7m, and Argyll expects to realise
at least Pounds 9m more from property transactions. That would represent a
Pounds 7m profit over the Pounds 12.7m book value of the stores, whose
annual sales are Pounds 150m.
The stores will be converted into Spar convenience stores and all 1,750
staff will be kept on.
'These stores have gone to a natural home, given their size and location,'
said Mr Colin Smith, Argyll's chief executive.
Mr Smith said Lo-Cost had remained profitable. But further evidence of the
pain felt by some discounters was provided by last month's profits warning
from Shoprite, the discount chain operating mainly in Scotland.
The sale leaves Argyll with 144 Lo-Cost stores, of which fewer than 50 are
smaller than 4,000 sq ft. Mr Smith said the trading prospects of the
remaining stores would be kept under review. Argyll is conducting a
strategic review of all its businesses.
The consortium buying the stores includes AF Blakemore, the family-owned
wholesaler; Appleby Westward, the grocery distributor; Alfred Jones; Capper;
and James Hall.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Claims threaten proceeds of British Coal sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government faces a potential fall in proceeds from selling British Coal
following an increase of more than Pounds 160m in claims against the
corporation from opencast contractors.
Some of the prospective bidders for the corporation's five regions say they
will have to revise downwards their proposed tenders to take account of the
claims, which can arise if unexpected mining obstacles are encountered. The
level of outstanding claims has risen threefold in three months to Pounds
242m.
Prospective bidders will be expected to meet at least some of the claims if
they win their bids.
Under opencast payment procedures, contractors put in a bid to British Coal,
which owns the coal, on how much they will charge to mine a site. Stiff
competition has forced down the tender prices in recent years.
Contractors can increase their earnings if they successfully claim for
unforeseen circumstances such as geological difficulties.
There is concern that some companies making claims are both opencast mining
contractors to British Coal and prospective bidders for the corporation.
Rivals say they are being put at a disadvantage because they cannot assess
as accurately as the claimants how much is likely to have to be paid.
Significant fluctuations in total claims are unusual: the Pounds 76m level
three months ago is considered within the industry to be nearer the norm
than the current Pounds 242m total. Most of the new claims are in Scotland,
where the total is Pounds 129m, against Pounds 25m three months ago. Claims
in south Wales are Pounds 76m (Pounds 25m three months ago), the north-east
of England Pounds 25.6m (Pounds 21m) and the central north and central south
regions a combined Pounds 12.5m (Pounds 5m).
If all the claims were to be paid, the government might have to pay bidders
to take some regions off its hands. 'The Scotland region is worth
considerably less than Pounds 129m,' one bidder said.
However, some of the claims are likely to be met by British Coal before the
regions are handed over. British Coal usually pays less than the amount
claimed, but all bidders have access to records showing the normal
proportion paid.
Claimants are privately defending the increases, saying they are bound to
flag up all the potential difficulties at the sites being mined before
ownership changes.
Bidders for the five regional packages must put in their tenders by
September 14. An announcement on preferred candidates is expected either
later in the month or in October to enable ownership to be transferred on
December 24.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Global investments surge after two years of decline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Global investment surged last year after two years of decline, according to
an influential United Nations report.
The latest World Investment Report, compiled by the UN Conference on Trade
and Development, reports that developing nations attracted record investment
flows.
Worldwide flows of foreign direct investment totalled Dollars 195bn in 1993,
up from Dollars 171bn the previous year but below the 1990 peak of Dollars
232bn. However, foreign investment in developing countries rose sharply, and
last year's Dollars 80bn total was twice 1991 levels.
China was the target for much of the rise with foreign investment last year
of Dollars 26bn, up from Dollars 4.4bn in 1991, making it the second largest
recipient of such funds after the US.
As a result, foreign affiliated ventures were estimated to account for more
than a quarter of China's exports of Dollars 92bn last year, compared with 9
per cent in 1989.
Unctad points out that most foreign investment inflows to developing nations
'are still concentrated in 10-15 host countries, overwhelmingly in Asia and
Latin America'. The world's poorest countries receive little such investment
 -a meagre Dollars 300m in 1993 - and their share has been declining.
However, fears that eastern Europe would corner funds that would otherwise
have gone to developing countries were unfounded, the report says. Inflows
into eastern Europe in 1993 were only Dollars 5bn, and the estimated total
in the region has reached some Dollars 13bn, little more than that of
Thailand.
Among industrialised countries, the US has regained its position as the most
attractive investment location, with foreign investment inflows of Dollars
32bn in 1993. It is also the largest source of such funds, investing a
record Dollars 50bn abroad last year.
Within the European Union, Britain is the most popular investment
destination, and the second biggest investor worldwide. Outflows from Japan,
however, have shrunk dramatically from Dollars 48bn in 1990 to Dollars 12bn
last year, reflecting the impact of recession.
The foreign investment surge means the influence of multinationals in the
world economy continues to expand, Unctad says. The report said about 37,000
parent companies with more than 200,000 foreign affiliates owned over
Dollars 2,100bn in overseas assets in 1993.

FT  31 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Volvo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Volvo looks in much less of a bind than when the doomed merger with Renault
was proposed last year. Yesterday's half-year figures show the impressive
impact of higher car and truck sales on profits. Since Volvo's main markets
 -the US, UK and Sweden - are recovering early, that could be a taste of
things to come from other European manufacturers. The weakness of the krona
has also sharpened Volvo's competitive edge. Shareholders who argued that
the merger seriously undervalued Volvo must be feeling a warm glow of
satisfaction, not least because the shares have outperformed the Swedish
market by 30 per cent this year.
More importantly, the balance sheet has been restored to good health without
the rights issue that was threatened if shareholders rejected the merger
option. With its stakes in Renault and Pharmacia - and the BCP consumer
product business - still to go, Volvo should have more than enough cash to
develop its next generation of cars and trucks without a partner.
The lingering doubt is whether Volvo has sufficient market clout on its own
to earn a decent rate of return on this investment. Although it has been
gaining market share, the suspicion remains that Volvo sells too few cars to
be sure of making an attractive return. The disposals programme merely buys
time in which the question of alliances can be revisited. Until Volvo comes
up with a convincing answer, though, it looks like a riskier investment than
its stronger competitors. On a multiple of around seven times next year's
forecast earnings, higher than the best of the US car giants, it is now
difficult to argue that Volvo is cheap.

FT  31 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Argyll
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Pounds 19.7m Argyll raised from the sale of 151 Lo-Cost and Presto
stores may look modest when set against their Pounds 150m of turnover. But
to realise more than asset value is a satisfactory result given the tough
conditions small discount stores now face. The superstore groups, including
Argyll's Safeway, have responded very effectively to the increased threat
from the discounters as the problems of Shoprite show only too clearly. Kwik
Save is having to work hard to grow sales and the continental European
newcomers are thought to be finding the pickings less easy than they
imagined.
The going is particularly tough for the smaller shops, and the fact the
Lo-Cost outlets are to be converted into the Spar convenience format
reflects the view that, at an average of 2,100 square feet, they are no
longer big enough to succeed as discount stores. Argyll's remaining Lo-Cost
outlets are more than twice the size and can be expected to fetch better
prices.
The problem for the smaller stores was that they did not have the range,
particularly in fresh foods, to compete with the new breed of convenience
stores. Groups like Watson &amp; Philip and T&amp;S Stores are bringing to
convenience shops the technology now standard in larger supermarkets. Thanks
to the huge changes in retailing systems in recent years, Tesco argues that
it can now make money out of much smaller units. But they are unlikely to
become more than a sideshow for the leading chains while the returns from
superstores remain so attractive.

FT  31 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Lonrho
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tiny Rowland will have his work cut out to justify the Pounds 5.5m-plus
he costs Lonrho each year in salary, expenses and other costs under his
direct control. The issue is not so much that the Lonrho joint chief
executive's Pounds 1.2m pay-packet is excessive. It is rather that his
expense account for items such as up-keep of his two homes and the company's
private jet looks high in relation to group's pre-tax profits of Pounds 172m
last year.
One could still defend the costs if they provided value for money. Mr
Rowland must, for example, entertain his business contacts and jet around
the world visiting Lonrho's far-flung trading operations. But this line of
defence would be easier to hold if Lonrho's financial performance was good.
In fact, the shares have been a poor investment since the late 1980s.
Mr Dieter Bock, the other Lonrho chief executive, seems intent on using the
issue to wrest full executive control of the group from Mr Rowland. While
many question Mr Bock's ability to squeeze more profit out of Lonrho's
operations, his plans to 'normalise' the group's relations with the City
have been welcomed by most shareholders. This should give him the edge if,
as expected, directors at Thursday's board meeting are asked to choose which
of two warring chief executives to back.

<TEXT>
Europe's defence industry has been set a challenge by the planned Dollars
10bn (Pounds 6.4bn) merger between Lockheed and Martin Marietta. Lockheed
Martin will not simply be a giant. The merger also marks an intensification
of the trend to create a lean US defence industry better able to win orders
in international markets. In the past, it may have been possible to argue
that US armaments were over-engineered and uncompetitive, so dependent had
companies become on soft Pentagon contracts. But the industry has reacted
determinedly to the end of the cold war by shedding staff and merging
facilities. Lockheed and Martin Marietta were important agents of change
even before yesterday's deal.
Much of the activity so far has involved horizontal integration. This was
the case in Northrop's Dollars 2bn takeover of Grumman in April. The
Lockheed Martin merger, by contrast, is partly about vertical integration.
An aircraft manufacturer is being linked with the world's largest producer
of aerospace electronics. The point will not be lost on Britain's
GEC-Marconi, which has long considered a vertical merger with British
Aerospace.
Lockheed Martin must still receive US antitrust approval. But this hurdle is
relatively low by comparison with the problems European defence groups face
in knocking their industry into shape. Continued concerns over national
sovereignty have virtually ruled out large cross-border takeovers and,
instead, encouraged messy collaborations like Eurofighter. But stepped-up
restructuring in the US means that the European approach to rationalisation
looks increasingly like an unsatisfactory half-way house.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Formula set for cost of transporting gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the main planks of the planned liberalisation of the domestic gas
market was put in place yesterday with the announcement of a new pricing
formula for British Gas's national pipeline system, the centrepiece of the
company's operations.
The price cap and rate of return announced by Ofgas, the gas industry
regulator, is an important element of the government's plan to introduce
competition into the domestic market beginning in 1996, because
transportation costs account for about half of the final price of gas to
consumers.
The formula will govern the prices TransCo, the new name for British Gas's
transport and gas storage business, can charge users of the national gas
grid. These include the trading arm of British Gas and the growing number of
independent gas marketers.
Ms Clare Spottiswoode, Ofgas director-general, said future price increases
by TransCo would be limited by a formula based on the retail price index
minus 5 percentage points. It will take effect in October and run until
1997. The starting price level of 14.16p per therm will also take effect on
October 1.
Ms Spottiswoode said RPI-minus-5 was a 'demanding but fair target for
British Gas'.
Ofgas said British Gas should be able to achieve a real rate of return of
6.5-7.5 per cent on new investment and 4-4.5 per cent on existing assets.
Both figures are in line with recommendations contained in last year's
Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on the gas industry.
British Gas had wanted a higher rate of return on TransCo assets, but it
said yesterday's announcement was expected. Some of its competitors had
lobbied Ofgas for a much stricter formula.
They had also asked for a root-and-branch revaluation of TransCo's assets,
which they claim are overvalued.
Mr John Astrop, commercial director of Kinetica Gas, a joint venture between
PowerGen and Conoco, said yesterday's announcement was 'an acceptable
interim solution'. But he said that Ofgas' decision not to focus on the
asset valuation issue will 'give British Gas an easy ride' until 1997.

Hello, hello. Sounds of more headbanging at Societe Generale de
Surveillance, the Swiss blue chip which prides itself on being the world's
largest trade inspection and testing organisation.
Elisabeth Salina, the beautiful and determined chairman, has sacked her
chief executive, former Perrier boss Thierry Chereau, less than two years
after she brought him in to help sort out the business.
His appointment had always looked a bit odd. SGS was still recovering from a
nasty boardroom battle in 1989 when Salina, then only 34, had headed a posse
of younger founding family members that won back control of the board. Many
observers were surprised that she brought in Chereau rather than become
chief executive herself.
Salina is now abolishing the position of chief executive claiming SGS has
become too complex to be run by one person, and is creating an executive
board. . . . which she will chair. She hopes potential successors will
emerge in the next five years, so she can withdraw again.
Don't hold your breath.

Plagued by poor earnings, JAL this summer launched a Disney campaign,

required to dress up as Minnie Mouse, including those distinctive outsize

They didn't much like that. Some even had the nerve to say they felt like
Bunny girls. Wrong rodent, surely? Anyway, their union has now wrung a
concession from management.
In an effort to stem the squeaking, the hostesses are now being given Minnie
Mouse aprons, 'to make wearing the head gear easier.' Terrific.

Can former US vice-president Dan Quayle really be thinking about running for
the presidency on the Republican ticket in 1996?
CNN reckons that Quayle, currently employed as a corporate lawyer in
Indianapolis, has decided to run after brisk trade in his autobiography,
Standing Firm. Maybe it's all a mistake - which it could well be, going by
past experience. Quayle it was who once advanced the theory that only
Republicans understood the importance of bondage between children and
parents. He famously insisted 'potato' was spelt 'potatoe'. Indeed, he
notched up enough gaffes to sustain a journal called the Quayle Quarterly,
to which US citizens could subscribe in order to catch up with his latest
mishaps.
Then again, any politician who is so despised by the liberal media can't be
all bad. Who knows, two years from now, maybe American voters will crave a
little dumbness.

Wow. The Alliance &amp; Leicester building society has become the first of its
kind to release interim profit figures on a voluntary basis.
Peter White, A&amp;L's chief executive, said his society had taken this historic
step to be in line with best practice and to improve accountability to its
members. No doubt. It may also be intended to impress upon the Treasury,
which is about to launch a consultation paper looking at how societies might
be made more accountable, that mutual organisations already have their
members in mind.
This extra information is welcome. But if A&amp;L was really keen to impress on
its customers the benefits of membership, it could revive an old building
societies tradition and pay them a dividend. One to watch for the full-year
results perhaps?

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
So has 63-year-old Roderick Hills, chairman of the Securities &amp; Exchange
Commission in the mid-1970s, found a resting place at last?
Hills and wife Carla, President Bush's trade negotiator, have found a new
stable. Both have become partners of the Washington office of Mudge Rose
Guthrie Alexander &amp; Ferdon, where Richard Nixon once practised. As well as
being another name to add to his immense biography, it has a solidly
international practice. Let's hope it works out better than his last two
sojourns.
In 1989, Hills had turned up at Donovan Leisure as managing partner of the
DC office. 'They really did need help,' he recalls. Trouble was, Hills was
also engaged in a regulatory job at Drexel Burnham Lambert, clearing up
after the junk bond saga. In due course it emerged that his new legal
colleagues were representing some of the Drexel employee partnerships that
had invested in the junk bonds.
So in 1992 Hills headed off to posh New York firm Shea &amp; Gould. Oh no] Two
years later, 'they (the firm) decided to commit suicide' and he and Carla,
who was also aboard by this time, were seeking fresh challenges. Shea &amp;
Gould's break-up was blamed on squabbling between partners over a multitude
of problems including succession. But there were whisperings anyway that the
Hills' energetic expansionary efforts overseas were less than fully
appreciated.
If Mudge Rose is curious as to how the competition conducts, or conducted,
itself, they now have a resident expert.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Joint manoeuvres aid the defence: A look at the motives
behind yesterday's merger of US companies Lockheed and Martin Marietta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Dan Tellep, chairman of Lockheed, the US aerospace company, was adamant
recently that defence companies would have to take the opportunities which
came their way in their search for consolidation. 'Everyone is looking at
everyone else, we have to be flexible,' he said.
At about the same time, Mr Norman Augustine, chairman of another aerospace
contractor, Martin Marietta, observed that 'huge cost savings are achievable
(from rationalisation)'.
In a New York hotel room on Monday night they put those ideas into action in
a merger between the two companies which will create the world's largest
defence business.
The deal reflects the philosophies of the two men. Faced with a tough
climate in the defence industry - US equipment spending has fallen by
two-thirds in real terms over 10 years - both have been leading the
consolidation of the sector. Both are clear that the best way to survive the
savage cutback of US equipment procurement is to be as lean, mean and as
large as possible.
The new company, Lockheed Martin, will certainly be big and well placed to
take on competitors. It will have sales of Dollars 23.5bn, making it only
slightly smaller than aircraft manufacturer Boeing. And after paying tax,
interest and dividends, the combined company will generate Dollars
4bn-Dollars 5bn in cash over the next five years to spend on investments or
acquisitions. The company will make the F-16 and advanced stealth F-22
fighters; the C-130 Hercules transporter; the Trident II, Hellfire II,
Patriot and Titan missiles and space launchers; military satellites and a
wide variety of avionics and airborne electronics equipment.
Yet for all the impressive array of products, there is comparatively little
overlap between the two merged companies. Lockheed has traditionally been an
airframe manufacturer, while Martin Marietta has concentrated on electronics
systems and missiles. In an ideal world the cost savings would have been
greater if each had merged with a company in its own field, but that is
unlikely to worry either chairman.
Both companies have already seen the need for consolidation in their own
specialities. Lockheed helped to rationalise the combat aircraft business
when it bought General Dynamics' F-16 fighter plant last year. Now with
fewer possible mergers around, Mr Tellep stresses the art of the possible
when looking for partners. In an industry where aggressive bids are rare,
the need is to find companies which can make mergers work, rather than where
the overlap is greatest.
Similarly, Martin Marietta added to its space businesses when it bought
operations from General Dynamics and conglomerate General Electric. However,
Mr Augustine thinks that there are plenty of overheads and duplicated costs
which can be cut out from defence companies even when the overlap between
their operations is small. Only in the two companies' space and missiles
businesses is there scope for large-scale synergy.
Apart from integrating space and missiles, the merged company's first
priority will be to cut central costs. Perhaps chillingly for those who work
there, the new company has already listed the opportunities for
consolidation: the two headquarters (there will be just one at Martin's site
in Bethesda near Washington DC); central functions such procurement,
property, information services and treasury; the 50m square feet of
manufacturing and office space; and the Dollars 750m of joint annual
research and development spending and Dollars 500m of capital investment.
Lower costs are one rationale for merger, but the chemistry between the top
managers in the two companies also helped bring about the deal. Mr Tellep is
the quieter, watchful strategist who complements Mr Augustine's extrovert
wit and wisdom. Each has already matched canny purchases with tough cost
cutting and has kept shareholders happy. At 62 Mr Tellep is the senior
figure who will slip naturally into the chair, yet will also retire early
enough to give Mr Augustine, who is 58, a good crack of the whip.
Besides, the US defence industry is currently like a game of musical chairs
where the number of spare seats is rapidly diminishing. Martin Marietta
tried and failed to buy aircraft-maker Grumman earlier this year when it was
snapped up by the Californian aerospace company Northrop. There is a growing
feeling that if companies do not find acceptable partners soon, they may be
too late.
This is despite the strong rise in the price of defence company shares since
the process of rationalisation in the US defence industry began three years
ago. Some felt that following the Northrop Grumman deal, mergers would slow
because share prices had risen too much. It may be no coincidence that
yesterday's deal will be financed by an exchange of shares rather than as a
cash bid - cutting out any bid premium which might otherwise have been paid.
Other defence companies feeling that they are too small to survive will not
feel any more comfortable as a result of this deal. The tightening ratchet
of rising share prices and reducing merger options has moved up another
notch.
There were, then, strong financial and management incentives behind the
merger. Still, for all that the deal has a sharply defensive air. It might
have been more natural for Lockheed to have merged with Boeing or McDonnell
Douglas, as they are in the airframe business too. Yet both are larger than
Lockheed and it would have been difficult for Mr Tellep to cut a deal on
equal terms.
Similarly, Martin Marietta has more in common with missile-makers Hughes or
Raytheon, but Mr Augustine would have found it hard to strike a deal with
General Motors, Hughes' owner, that would have enhanced his position.
Thus there is a sense in which yesterday's deal was the result of threats
faced by the companies rather than the opportunities ahead. The most obvious
threat is the squeeze on defence spending. Equipment purchases are likely to
fall further in the next few years and, according to Bankers Trust, a US
bank, the number employed in the US defence industry will fall from 800,000
to 500,000 by 1997. Yet much of the retrenchment has already been completed,
and defence contractors are now generating strong cash flows.
A newer threat came from the US deputy defence secretary, Mr John Deutch,
last week, when he called into question a whole array of next-generation
weapons. They included the hitherto-sacred Dollars 71bn F-22 air superiority
fighter programme, in which Lockheed has a two-thirds stake, and the
Comanche helicopter, which has electronics supplied by Martin Marietta. If
any of these programmes are cancelled or delayed substantially, the defence
squeeze may force many more companies from the field.
There is also the financial threat from the stock market. So far
cost-cutting defence companies have been favourites with institutional
investors. But the strong cash flow they have generated may also attract
corporate raiders keen to sell off bits and pocket the growing cash
mountains.
Whatever the prime motives, there is little doubt that the US defence
business will emerge with fewer stronger players from the current bout of
mergers. That should give manufacturers in Europe pause for thought. With
mega-deals between the largest US contractors happening two or three years
before most pundits predicted, European companies have even less time than
thought to rationalise their operations if they are to remain competitive.
However, the political barriers to European consolidation will remain. And
squabbles in coming months over national workshares on projects such as the
Future Large Aircraft and Eurofighter 2000 will make the European industry
resemble a three-ring circus set against the leaner US fighting machine.

FT  31 AUG 94 / A prize for paring: Pentagon policy is encouraging companies
to restructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the first questions facing the bosses of the defence giant created
yesterday will be how much money they can reasonably demand from the
Pentagon as 'reward' for their contribution to streamlining the industry.
For the past year the Pentagon has followed a controversial policy of
subsidising restructuring moves in the overcrowded defence sector by passing
back to industry a share of the benefits that accrue to the public purse.
At least in theory, one the first beneficiaries of the industry's efforts to
cut costs should be the Pentagon and hence taxpayers. The Pentagon has
acknowledged this by being prepared to pass back to the companies involved a
part of the benefit it receives when arms makers are able to quote lower
prices for their products as a result of streamlining.
The onus is on the companies to provide the Pentagon with detailed evidence
that they can deliver particular weapons more cheaply as a result of reduced
overheads. But when mergers or acquisitions are planned, the chances of a
reward have become an important part of the financial calculations.
Mr Norman Augustine, chairman of Martin Marietta, has been one of the most
prominent advocates - and beneficiaries - of the Pentagon's policy, whose
architect is Mr John Deutch, the deputy secretary for defence.
The policy has its critics on the political right - which views it as
interference with the market - and on the left, which accuses the
administration of encouraging big lay-offs.
Mr Larry Korb, a former Pentagon official who now works for the Brookings
Institution think-tank, is one of the harshest right-wing critics of the
policy. He believes that on the basis of past 'rewards', the giant
corporation created yesterday could ask the Pentagon for about Dollars 1bn
in help with restructuring costs. Other experts are expecting a much lower
figure.
Mr Korb maintains that the Pentagon should respond sceptically, and is
dismissive of arguments from Mr Deutch that the policy promotes rational
streamlining. 'Who is to determine what's rational other than markets?' he
asks.
However there are some observers who see the Pentagon's policy as the only
alternative to a disastrous free-fall in the sector.
'You either have managed downsizing this way or you have unmanaged
downsizing, which is essentially companies going out of business,' says Mr
Richard Bitzinger of the Defense Budget Project, a Washington research
group.
However, the fact the Pentagon is prepared to encourage mergers does not
mean that it has abandoned all concerns about anti-trust issues. There was
disappointment in the US defence industry last spring, when the Pentagon, in
a review of anti-trust procedures, pointedly avoided calling for any special
treatment for the sector.
Anti-trust enforcement officials at the Department of Justice and the
Federal Trade Commission have traditionally been reluctant to treat defence
companies any differently from civilian manufacturers.
They have successfully challenged mergers such as the proposed acquisition
in 1992 of Olin Corp's ammunition division by Alliant Techsystems, on the
grounds that the deal would create a monopoly supplier of certain shells and
ammunition.
But in practice, few defence mergers have been blocked. Some industry
experts say the Alliant-Olin link-up was a transparent attempt to merge
pre-emptively so that the two companies would not have to bid against each
other on a large ammunition contract that was known to be imminent. Anything
less blatant than that has generally escaped challenge.
'Defence is special. But we also concluded that it is not so special that
current law and guidelines ought not to apply,' said Professor Robert
Pitofsky, an anti-trust expert.
As a monopsony or single buyer, the Pentagon has the clout to look after its
own interests, and its use of subsidies is an example of this.
In the case of Lockheed and Martin Marietta, there is, in fact, remarkably
little overlap of the kind to raise anti-trust concerns except perhaps in
the field of satellites. 'Other than that (satellites), I don't see any
difficulties in big (weapons) platforms,' says Mr Erik Pages of Business
Executives for National Security, a Washington defence think-tank.
The real anti-trust dilemmas for the US defence industry will emerge at a
later stage in the down-sizing of the sector, a process which shows no sign
of abating.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Virtue in mega-deals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After the financial excesses of the 1980s a new wave of takeovers and
mergers denominated in billions of dollars inevitably gives rise to a sense
of unease. The nervousness is magnified when, as in the case of SmithKline
Beecham's offer for Sterling Health this week, a Dollars 2.9bn bid is
financed on borrowed money and declared to be part of a plan to become 'the
major healthcare company in the world'.
Yet the generalised worry can be overdone. The financing of most of the
mega-deals so far this year has fallen well short of the risks run in the
heyday of leveraged buyouts. The deals are also being driven chiefly by
industrial logic. The get-together between defence contractors Lockheed and
Martin Marietta is part of a desirable rationalisation in an industry that
has already seen the marriage of such giants as Northrop and Grumman earlier
this year. SmithKline Beecham and Sterling are following a route already
explored by Merck and Eli Lilly, among others.
If the deals have anything in common, it is that they amount to a backhanded
tribute to the effectiveness of the Clinton administration's fiscal policy.
Defence and healthcare spending were two of the more dynamic components of
the budget deficits that piled up under Mr Clinton's predecessors. The end
of the Cold War and the need for discipline in welfare spending have
combined to change government priorities. Mega-deals are a just one
indication of how the corporate sector is trimming its sails to the
prevailing fiscal wind.
These problems are common to most of the industrialised world. But rapid
adjustment in the US is facilitated by the existence of a more sophisticated
takeover market. Europe's response is nonetheless under way, although the
commitment to fiscal orthodoxy, which is encouraged by the Maastricht
convergence criteria, varies widely from government to government. Measures
to cut spending and increase taxes are accompanied by an accelerating
privatisation programme that will shift part of the burden of public sector
finance from debt to equity markets. Among Europe's corporate giants
awaiting treatment are Lufthansa in Germany, Renault in France, and Italian
energy and telecom concerns Enel and Stet.
One of the conventional wisdoms of the post-Cold War world is that the
adoption of the liberal market model in developing countries will raise
investment returns and attract a growing flow of First World capital. This
is undeniable; but it should not be forgotten that the potential for
increasing risk-adjusted returns in the public sector of the industrialised
world is also very great.
One lesson of the British privatisation programme is certainly that
policymakers tend to underestimate the scope for efficiency gains at the
time of privatisation. The dynamic effects that come from the introduction
of market discipline into hitherto protected industrial structures are far
reaching. The phenomenon may also result in a pattern of capital flows that
diverges sharply from that suggested by the global distribution of payments
imbalances.
There may be advantages, too, for continental Europe in the more active
equity markets that will result from privatisation. The merits of takeovers
in bringing about industrial restructuring remain controversial. But a
deeper secondary market is a magnet for external portfolio funds and thereby
helps reduce the cost of domestic capital.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Late payment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Are late payments such a problem for European companies as to threaten the
economic recovery now under way? The European Commission thinks so. It has
just produced draft recommendations to EU governments that companies which
pay bills late should suffer statutory penalties. The practice, it says,
jeopardises cross-border trade and the single market.
According to the Commission, the average time between delivery of goods or
services and payment has steadily lengthened to an EU average of 66 days
last year. The Commission blames recession for encouraging the practice, but
says that companies are not relinquishing the habit during recovery.
Its main proposal is that companies should have a statutory right to
interest at commercial rates on the overdue payment. It also wants court
procedures for seeking redress to be simplified. The recommendations are not
legally binding and do not require members' approval, but may be followed by
a directive if the next two years bring no results.
The plans have provoked opposition, notably from the UK, which has one of
the worst records on late payment, but have also been welcomed by small
businesses which suffer particularly from unexpected shortfalls in cashflow.
But it is not clear that the proposals will achieve the desired effect.
Many EU member countries already give companies a statutory right to
interest on late payments. Although these countries have better payment
records than the UK, delays are still considerable, and appear to have
lengthened recently. Moreover, companies in these countries typically agree
longer credit periods, and the Commission plan could encourage that to
become widespread. Nor is it clear that action at EU level is warranted: the
Commission has not convincingly established its starting point that the
practice threatens cross-border trade.
What is needed instead is a range of less drastic measures by member
countries and by companies themselves. Clearer contracts, better ways of
checking the creditworthiness of customers, and easier access to annual
accounts of foreign companies would all help companies reduce credit risk.
Europe-wide legislation, however, is not the answer.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Leading Article: African compact
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The warning signals from Africa are ominous. New tensions surface, and old
conflicts continue. The burdens of natural and man-made disasters, crippling
debt and enervating disease have become intolerable. Yet, as Africa's plight
has become more acute over the years, the international response has tended
to be belated and poorly co-ordinated.
Spasms of compassion have taken the place of pre-emptive action. Hastily
planned operations in Somalia and Rwanda have not been sustained. Other
states in need of help, such as Sierra Leone, have been abandoned.
Western policy has been damaged by allowing the principle that aid should be
linked to good governance and human rights to be influenced by short-term
expediency. In Kenya, the country's first multi-party elections for over 20
years were flawed, but nevertheless won international endorsement.
Elsewhere, the principle seems negotiable: a multi-party poll was a
precondition for resumption of normal aid to Kenya, but not for Uganda.
Nigeria is the latest test of the international community's willingness to
assist an African country in distress, before pictures of disaster appear in
western living rooms. Although the US was sufficiently concerned to have
sent an emissary to Lagos, Jesse Jackson was thought too close to former
military leader General Ibrahim Babangida, and to Chief Moshood Abiola, the
jailed opposition leader, to play honest broker. As for the UK, it emerges
with no credit, for it has not seen fit to send a foreign office minister to
assess a crisis which could destabilise the region.
Western powers may have assumed prominent roles in Somalia and Rwanda, but
they have failed to meet responsibilities elsewhere: in Zaire, for example.
The west must even bear some responsibility for the resumption of the
Angolan civil war after the 1992 election. Namibia's transition to
independence under UN monitors required some 6,000 personnel, while Angola
had to make do with barely 600.
Africa's problems are complex and daunting. But the west can act sooner, do
more and perform better. The continent's plight requires a more effectively
co-ordinated and longer-term effort. The disarray in the ranks of donors and
aid agencies must also end.
The way influential charities - such as Oxfam and Christian Aid - the
Economic Commission for Africa and other UN agencies are at odds with the
World Bank over reform policies is profoundly damaging. Yet there is more
common ground than seems to be the case. The need for radical debt relief,
greater attention to the impact of reform on the poor and strengthened
management capacity, are concerns common to all.
More than 10 years ago, the World Bank called for 'a new kind of social
compact, an agreement within the world community that the struggle against
poverty in Africa is a joint concern'. Such a compact is now urgent. Without
it, Africa's crisis could become a catastrophe.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Error to abolish House of Lords - but
reform another matter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NICHOLAS BEALE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Roland Rudd's article advocating the abolition of the House of Lords is
misconceived ('Time to go, m'lords', August 25). The great advantage of the
House of Lords is that its members are free to speak their minds and are
mostly not politicians.
It is not an 'accident' that such a group is often better informed and makes
wiser decisions than the House of Commons. To abolish such a valuable
institution for reasons of prejudice would be a grave error.
But reform is a different matter. To make it completely democratic all that
is needed is a modest adjustment to the voting system used in the upper
house. Each peer would have a number of 'shares' which would be the total
number of votes cast for his or her party at the last general election,
divided by the number of peers who are members of that party. The votes of
abstainers would be divided equally between the independent peers. This
would combine the benefits of proportional representation with the
advantages of an independent-minded and knowledgeable second chamber, using
a system familiar to all shareholders and company directors. Combined with
the nostalgic appeal for ennobled former trades union leaders, its
attractions should be irresistible.

chancellor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER ROST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, If the UK chancellor is looking for extra revenue, he should consider a
one-off capital and profits levy on the regional electricity companies. This
would be politically popular, compensating for the embarrassing
undervaluation of the privatisation reflected in the trebled share prices.
Siphoning off some of the bulging surplus cash, with even more to come from
the sale of National Grid Company, would not be seen as unfair, and it is
justifiable economically, as it would assist in the reduction of the public
sector borrowing and offers earlier scope for beneficial tax cuts elsewhere.
A previous chancellor's excess profits levy on the windfall profits of the
banks provides a respectable precedent.

FT  31 AUG 94 / French left wanting: The Socialists face a dilemma ahead of
the presidential election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week, in a telling post-script to the collapse of the French Socialist
party, Michel Rocard, long-standing star of the party, finally abandoned his
presidential ambitions. It was a poignant and symbolic moment in the postwar
history of French politics. And it raises the question whether the
Socialists can pull themselves together, and if so, how and on what terms.
For 20 years and more, this intelligent man's popularity made it seem almost
inevitable that he would one day contest, and might win, the presidency.
Only three things stood in his way: President Francois Mitterrand, the
factionalism of the Socialist party, and its eventual disintegration.
Between them, they put paid to Mr Rocard's presidential ambitions.
President Mitterrand cordially disliked Mr Rocard for his intelligence, for
his popularity, and for his insubordinate ambitions; and since Mr Mitterrand
dominated the Socialist party, he had the whip hand. In the run-up to two
presidential elections Mr Rocard virtually declared his candidacy; on both
occasions he withdrew in favour of Mr Mitterrand, but these retreats did not
earn him Mr Mitterrand's gratitude, merely scorn for his weakness and anger
for his offence of lese-majeste. Mr Mitterrand was determined Mr Rocard
should not succeed him in the Elysee Palace.
For nearly 20 years Mr Mitterrand maintained his dominance of the Socialist
party by manipulating rival clans or courants. But by 1990 his power was
waning, and the faction leaders precipitated the inevitable power struggle
for the succession.
In an early spasm of this struggle, it looked as though Mr Rocard would be
the primary beneficiary, when he negotiated a token endorsement as the
party's future presidential candidate. But this window of hope swung shut
with the Socialists' massive defeat in the general election of 1993: Mr
Rocard lost his seat in the National Assembly, and though he briefly seized
formal control of the Socialist party machine, he was himself thrown out
this year, when he led the party to an even more catastrophic defeat in the
European Parliament elections.
Last week Rocard let it be known that he would be giving up his position as
mayor of the town of Conflans-Sainte-Honorine in the western outskirts of
Paris. His friends claim that he will continue to play a leading role in the
party. But the commentators and the opinion polls tell a different story: Mr
Rocard is out of the running, almost certainly for good.
But the Socialist party is not out of the running. It has been battered by
its recent electoral defeats, but there is a general presumption that it
ought to be able to recover some of the lost ground. In this year's European
Parliament elections, the Socialists sank to an abysmal 14.5 per cent of the
vote, and the communists to less than 7 per cent. Nobody believes that what
used to be called the left-wing electorate - 48 per cent in the 1988 general
election - has disappeared, especially not in a period of economic woe. The
problem is how to recover the lost voters.
The immediate focus of attention is the presidential election campaign next
spring, since in France the presidency determines everything. And with the
evaporation of Mr Rocard as the Socialist party candidate, it is being
assumed his place will be taken by Mr Jacques Delors, president of the
European Commission, who has the merits of being French, socialist and
popular with the French electorate. Since his tenure in Brussels expires at
the end of this year, he will be available just in time for the French
presidential election campaign.
And yet his relationship with the party may be a difficult one. Mr Delors is
not by temperament a fighter, nor is he a seasoned political campaigner; and
though he is a member of the Socialist party, many in the party distrust him
for being, not just a Social Democrat (like Mr Rocard), but in effect a
Christian Democrat. Since he is not a fighter, it seems unlikely he will
stand unless he is sure of the unanimous support of the party. But this is a
party which is, and has always been, structurally divided; and it will not
willingly surrender to an outsider, except after laborious negotiations or
in desperation.
On the surface, the Socialists' dilemma seems acute, because of their recent
defeats. But their biggest problem is one affecting the whole political
establishment: popular revulsion against the traditional parties of
government. The most spectacular result in this year's European elections
may have been the drop in the Socialist vote; but it was perhaps less
significant than the fact that the governing conservative parties scored
less than 26 per cent.
The specifics of this election result can be partly explained by the
mobilisation of anti-Maastricht sentiment, notably by the ultra-nationalist
group led by Mr Philippe de Villiers. But you only have to go back to the
regional elections of 1992, to find a similar desertion of the traditional
parties of government, in favour of minority and protest parties.
The basic rule for the presidential election is simple: you can't get
elected except as the candidate of a major party of government. Raymond
Barre campaigned as a solitary figure in 1988, and scored a respectable 17
per cent, but he could not be elected. But recent elections indicate the
French dislike and distrust their traditional political parties.
In other words, it is possible Mr Delors could be elected as standard bearer
for the Socialists, even though the party is now intensely unpopular, and
many traditional Socialists distrust him. This would pose, in extreme form,
the ambiguity of the French constitution between its parliamentary and its
presidential aspects.

Sir, I have followed with interest your coverage of Lord Archer's dealings
in the shares of Anglia TV.
Your paper has frequently featured the problems facing small investors in
their access to the Stock Exchange. I am sure that your readers would
consider it a valuable service if you were to publish a list of other
individuals who are prepared to deal on behalf of friends and acquaintances
in the shares of public companies of which their spouse is a director.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not convincing evidence on market
testing savings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN SHELDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Sir Peter Levene protests too much. He writes (Letters, August 26) that
detailed evidence to back up the claims for savings made from market testing
Civil Service activities is publicly documented in the Citizen's Charter
Second Report. I assume he is referring to the table entitled 'Annual
savings and department-wide costs of market testing' in that document.
Unfortunately for Sir Peter, there is no detailed breakdown of the basis of
the claimed 'savings', just rows of figures which we are presumably expected
to take at face value. Taxpayers and civil servants are entitled to more
than this. A series of assertions presented in tabulated form is no more
convincing than if presented in any other form. The table makes very
impressive-looking claims for millions of pounds of savings, until (like
most quack remedies) you look at the small print.
The notes accompanying the table state: 'The savings figures measure
estimated savings in future years', and 'therefore the calculation of any
net savings figure should be treated with caution, and regarded as
illustrative only'. This is not what most people would call a convincing
piece of evidence.

FT  31 AUG 94 / British bottle in the Mexican heat: Michael Cassell joins a
temporary trade promoter trying to boost UK exports in testing conditions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Cadwallader stepped out into the sunshine on Mexico City's Rio De
La Plata and drew a deep breath. It might not have been wise, given air
pollution verging on the edible, but it was understandable.
The previous 90 minutes, in the office of Professor Hector Tello, president
of the local British Chamber of Commerce, had been tough. Prof Tello had
questioned the British government's commitment to help UK companies do
business in Mexico and cited the impressive export efforts of competitors
like Spain, France and Germany.
It had not made easy listening for Mr Cadwallader, temporarily plucked from
his job as a regional export manager with Boots, the UK retailing and
pharmaceuticals group, to help the Department of Trade and Industry bat for
Britain in Mexico.
He had been amazed to discover that a chamber anxious to back the British
effort was not aware the government had a strategy to boost exports to
Mexico. Asked how this could be, Mr Christopher Jebb, second commercial
secretary at the British Embassy, and Mr Cadwallader's 'minder' for the day,
explained that it was 'probably confidential'.
The exchange offered a small insight into the differences in approach
between civil servants and salesmen as they seek to work together to win
business. There is a cultural gap in experience and understanding which the
DTI is now trying to bridge.
Under a much-trumpeted initiative launched last year by Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, 100 export promoters such as Mr
Cadwallader are now on loan to the DTI from companies and trade bodies.
Their salaries continue to be paid by their employers. Some recruits see the
job as a useful career move, others as a final challenge before retirement,
and a few have chosen secondment to ward off redundancy.
Each armed with their experience and a Pounds 40,000-a-year travel and
promotions budget, they comprise Mr Heseltine's private export army. Their
mission, as they shuttle backwards and forwards to the UK, is to use their
knowledge of world markets to sharpen up a government export promotion
machine charged with narrowing the UK's visible trade deficit, which reached
Pounds 1bn in May.
All the export promoters, most on two-year secondments, pay regular calls to
the eighth floor of Kingsgate House in London's Victoria, home to the DTI's
export promotion operation - reorganised to try to improve its
effectiveness. Mr Cadwallader says he is impressed by the quality and scale
of the DTI's market information but says the department has not used it to
best advantage.
Eighty countries have been targetted as priority markets and each is
supported by teams of DTI desk officers who have been relieved of their
trade policy responsibilities to concentrate on export promotion.
Mr Heseltine's troopers have notched up hundreds of thousands of miles in
search of market opportunities, returning to alert more than 8,000 UK
companies.
At 53, David Cadwallader has 30 years of marketing and sales behind him and
is one of eight export promoters for Latin America. He has sole
responsibility for Mexico, where the UK - at the turn of the century
Mexico's biggest trading partner - now accounts for only about one per cent
of imports. In the first six months of 1994, UK exports to Mexico reached
Pounds 186m, leaving a surplus of Pounds 80m. UK corporate investors rank
second only to the US.
According to Mr Cadwallader: 'There is a film industry image of Mexico as
unstable, bandit-country beset by high inflation and poverty. The reality is
7 per cent inflation, growing consumerism and massive infrastructure and
privatisation programmes.'
He does not suggest everything is rosy. Nervousness among foreign investors
ahead of the recent presidential election highlighted the continuing caution
of many businessmen. 'In Mexico, there are bureaucratic barriers and
ever-changing government regulations. But Britain and British goods are
liked, and there are opportunities to sell everything from fine china to
prefabricated housing.' At home, he is driving 20,000 miles a year by car to
ensure companies know it.
On his first, nine-day visit to Mexico - he plans up to six a year - Mr
Cadwallader notched up 50 meetings with government and state bodies. At the
start of this, his second visit, he has already given radio, television and
newspaper interviews before embarking on a packed programme largely designed
to explore the market for consumer goods.
His day begins over breakfast at the Restaurant Continental with import
agent Laura Turrell. She is particularly excited about the imminent arrival
from the UK of Worcester Bear, whose exploits in search of honey are
depicted on a new range of china ware to be sold in the smart boutiques of
Mexico City, Monterrey and Guadalajara.
Lunch follows at the Ile de France with executives from Mexico's Liverpool
department store chain, which owes its name to the British port which
prospered in the golden years of UK-Mexico trade. The store would run a
British Week but there are not enough products. 'We think UK goods are too
expensive and you think we have no money,' suggests Enrique Chabre, a
director.
The day also includes a series of meetings with other importers, local
lawyers and executives from UK companies established in the country. Over
evening drinks, Mr Cadwallader chats to two young brothers who handle fancy
English chocolates and want more items to satisfy the Mexican sweet tooth.
An early flight to Monterrey the next day takes him to a round of talks with
businessmen and state government officials on infrastructure projects. Back
in Mexico City, Mr Cadwallader sees Mr David Waugh, who heads Trafalgar
House operations locally and is after a Dollars 200m water distribution
project in Guadalajara. He might have to see off the French and to do that,
he says, the company will need plenty of political support.
Mr Cadwallader offers all the assistance he can but it will be limited.
Despite demands from Mr Michael Portillo, former chief secretary to the
Treasury, that the DTI's expenditure on some export assistance be trimmed
further, the budget is small. This year, the DTI has Pounds 57m to spend on
improving UK trade overseas, Pounds 5m of which is set aside for Mr
Heseltine's team of export promoters.
At a planning meeting at the British Embassy, Mr David Berg, deputy head of
mission, acknowledges 'money is very tight'. Six trade missions to Mexico
are planned for 1995 but there will not be enough DTI cash to help them all.
It is an unequal battle against big-spending competitors such as the
Germans. 'There is no question those engaged in commercial promotion feel as
though they have one hand tied behind their back', says Sir Roger Hervey,
the retiring British ambassador to Mexico, whose embassy spends 60 per cent
of its time promoting UK business interests.
Mr Cadwallader thinks he is lucky working with a commercially-oriented
embassy but he still harbours thoughts to send shivers down the back of many
a career diplomat. In his five minutes with Mr Heseltine he was bold enough
to suggest the Mexican embassy should be converted into a showcase for
Britain filled with commercial staff. The secretary of state expressed
regret that embassies were the responsibility of the Foreign Office.
Mr Heseltine says deals are now being done as a direct result of his
promoter's efforts and he may enlist more. Not all the promoters, however,
have proved particularly energetic and future recruitment might be more
selective. Some DTI export promotion staff still resent 'outsiders' on their
patch, though much of the original scepticism has disappeared.
Mr Cadwallader thinks his job in a country of 87m people might have to be
more focused to be effective and is still waiting for confirmation of the
first export deal to arise directly from his efforts. He says he is looking
forward to cracking open a bottle of champagne, though he accepts it is one
product in which the UK simply cannot compete.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Right price for Euro electricity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID PORTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The frustration of the Germany city which is not allowed to buy cheaper
electricity from the Netherlands is understandable ('Sparks fly over attempt
to break power barrier', August 25). I have met commercial users of
electricity who, having secured lower prices through supply competition in
Britain, wonder why their outlets in other parts of Europe are not allowed a
similar choice between electricity suppliers.
Competition between producers and the right to choose a supplier will drive
down electricity prices and help to make Europe more competitive.
Unfortunately, that prospect does not appeal to many of Europe's electricity
monopolies, which are resisting liberalisation. There is no shortage of
companies waiting to provide competition - many of them British - but it
will not come about until more of Europe's electricity customers insist on
choice. They should stand up and be counted.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: No sense of nostalgia for Third Reich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GEORGE HEINDL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I would have enjoyed your otherwise interesting article, 'As They Say
in Europe' (August 27), much more had it not been for the reference to the
'Third Reich' which got it all wrong. Nobody in his right mind in Austria
feels nostalgic about the Third Reich. The times when people would go to
Bratislava on the tram without any border controls were not during the Third
Reich but during the Habsburg monarchy. Border controls were introduced
after the dismemberment of the monarchy and the tram service suspended when
the Iron Curtain went down only 40 miles east of Vienna.
Neither did the multinational monarchy have any colonies. It is difficult to
imagine any empire of the day which would have made colonials foreign
ministers like the Polish and Hungarian counts Goluchowski and Andrassy, or
even prime minister like Count Taaffe, the offspring of an Irish family.
True, Austria is firmly anchored in the west. At the same time we have
offered our neighbours to the east a helping hand on their way into the new
Europe. This was stated explicitly by President Klestil only a few days ago
at a meeting of eight central European heads of state.
There will be no resurrection of the empire because, as you say, history is
not about to repeat itself. But there will be a new dimension of European
co-operation in which Austria definitely will play her part.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Arts: The grubby versus the prissy - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The contortions achieved by BBC television in its determination on the one
hand to stay with the tabloid newspapers in covering royal scandals, while
on the other hand desperately trying to avoid being lumped in with them, are
wonderful to behold. Its technique brings to mind that of the tabloids in
years gone by when they found a juicy story about some eminent actress
having appeared in blue movies during her youth. Thunderous condemnations of
the disgusting nature of the films would be accompanied by entire double
spreads packed with stills from the scenes in question: 'Isn't it
disgusting? And here's some more]' The BBC's ploy is to pretend that while
it remains aloof from royal scuttlebut and would never concern itself with
whether Princess Diana really has been making nuisance phone calls to an art
dealer acquaintance - good heavens, this is the BBC you know, miles above
that sort of thing - it is, however, duty bound in the public interest to
report on the way that the tabloid press hounds the poor old royals. Of
course it so happens that in the process the entire story is conveyed in
detail to the viewers but, well, the BBC can hardly help that, can it? This
pose of disdainful superiority towards the popular papers with their royalty
watchers would carry more weight if BBC reports did not invariably include
material from the BBC's own royalty watcher, Jenny Bond.
The notion of a lily white BBC, operating way above the level of the
ordinary, grubby mass media, would be less laughable if they did not screen
programmes such as Jonathan Ross Presents David Copperfield. No doubt Mr
Copperfield is an outstanding illusionist - that was certainly the
impression given by this programme which went out at 8pm on Friday evening
on the BBC's more popular channel - but it is clearly no coincidence that he
is about to bring his act to London. For him this programme served as a
50-minute commercial, not least because Ross obligingly announced the venue
and dates and declared that he would be there. It would be interesting to
know precisely who paid what to whom to get this little lot on the air;
licence payers might feel that Mr Copperfield should have been paying the
BBC. And where did Mr Ross's own television production company fit in?
When we began the Edinburgh Television Festival in the 1970s it was meant,
at least partly, as a thorn in the side of the broadcasting establishment,
and for a couple of years it worked. Then that very establishment (which, to
be fair, had always supplied the money) took over, and for most of the 1980s
it became a rather boring event. Scores of indie producers spent days trying
to get a word with Jeremy or Melvyn in the bar of the George. The most
memorable moment occurred when Jeremy (Isaacs, that is) gave the MacTaggart
Memorial Lecture and enthused so much over the forthcoming Channel 4 that he
was credited with delivering the MacTaggart Memorial Job Application. But
mostly it was dull. This year matters seem to have perked up considerably
with a good squib delivered by MacTaggart lecturer Greg Dyke, until recently
chief executive of London Weekend TV. The Isaacs 'job application' worked,
as we know, and you have to wonder whether Mr Dyke was following suit. Since
he now has millions of pounds from his LWT share options he scarcely needs
another job, yet he would be an ideal person to head the government
broadcasting commission which he declared the next Labour administration
should set up to look at new ways of choosing those who run British
broadcasting. His main concern seems to be one that has been expressed many
times in this column: that - unlike the newspapermen who went to prison in
the long fight to win the freedom of the press - those who run commercial
television are not chiefly concerned with freedom of speech or with
journalism at all, but with profits. And those who run the BBC depend upon
the government for their very existence. Consequently they are all far too
cosy with politicians.
What with Michael Grade then lamming into the prissy old busybodies who are
allowed to gag and hobble dramatists, journalists and entertainers in
Britain via a network of organisations set up in response to 'the Mary
Whitehouse tendency', it really does seem as though the Edinburgh Television
Festival has put itself right back on the agenda. It was very much Grade's
weekend because on the Saturday he appeared on BBC2 interviewing his famous
uncle, Lew, in The Persuader: The TV Times Of Lord Lew Grade. Given Lord
Grade's age and the pleasure so many of his series - from Sunday Night At
The London Palladium to Jesus Of Nazareth - have given so many viewers, it
was right that this should be a fond and indulgent programme. But however
fashionable retro-telly may have become, we should remember that most of
Lord Grade's series (The Buccaneers, The Persuaders, The Adventures Of Robin
Hood, The Adventures Of William Tell, The Saint and more, many of them
revived on BBC2 this week) were deeply undemanding, unchallenging and
unoriginal. There were two extraordinary exceptions: The Prisoner and The
Muppet Show. What a pity that, while championing those, Lew did his own spot
of gagging and hobbling by suppressing for 20 years Kenneth Griffith's bold
and eye-opening documentary Hang Up Your Brightest Colours, about the IRA
leader Michael Collins.
Once in a while comes a programme which jerks you back in your chair with
news of some imminent major change in the world. A BBC report on the
microchip, which predicted pretty well everything that has subsequently
occurred, sticks in the memory, and now Channel 4's Equinox has shown how
electronic road tolls are likely to become the norm soon. Given that it cost
Pounds 5 to travel from London to Norwich on the toll roads in 1789, about
Pounds 300 at today's rates according to the programme, we should probably
not be too full of foreboding . . . and yet, some of the proposals for
extending roadside electronic monitoring to the point where drivers become
superfluous did make you think about Big Brother.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Arts: Lucinda Childs - Edinburgh Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SOPHIE CONSTANTI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the Edinburgh Festival's matchless double thrill - Miami City Ballet's
treasure trove of works by Balanchine; the Mark Morris Dance Group's
life-affirming L'Allegro, il Pensaroso ed il Moderato - the Lucinda Childs
Dance Company was bound to come as a sobering experience.
For anyone interested in post-Judson (that is, post-post modern) American
dance, Childs is required viewing. But the wider significance of her work is
to be found in its illustration of the consanguinity between ideas and
procedures first employed by Merce Cunningham/John Cage, and the new dance
movement which developed in Britain during the 1970s and early '80s. After
discarding much of the outwardly limp, if formative, radicalism of the
1960s, Childs set about building and refining a style of minimalist dance
which seemed blankly driven by obsessive order and symmetry, and
symbiotically informed by the repetitive rhythms provided in the music of
contemporary composers such as Philip Glass.
Her company, currently celebrating its 20th anniversary and making its
British debut, brought a selection of five works to Edinburgh's Playhouse
Theatre. Dance, Childs' oldest, longest and most successful piece, dominated
programme one; the second programme - a triple bill of pieces created
between 1991 and 1993 - showed Childs' predeliction for even tighter
minimalistic structures than those she employed back in 1979 for Dance.
Most inscrutable and monophonic of this recent batch of works - all
accompanied by harpsichordist Elisabeth Chojnaska - is Concerto, a
nine-minute drill for seven perfectly behaved dancers whose incorruptible
step patterns are finally broken by the last, plangent chords of Gorecki's
score and by the photographic flash of light which catches the line up of
approaching figures in a sudden ghostly relief.
In comparison, Ribbon Plus and One and One seem tinged with a secret
lyricism - although Childs, who makes solo appearances in both works,
ensures that it is kept closer to her head than to her heart. However,
beneath the dancers busy, precise footwork, collective mask of solid
concentration, and willowy and balletic - but oddly unyielding - postures,
one can seen a physical language which is both sporty and classical,
cerebral and yet intuitive.
And it is a language which in Dance finds a natural partner in the grainy,
black and white film supplied by Sol LeWitt. Behind LeWitt's vertically and
horizontally-split, moving images of the work's original cast (including
Childs) of 15 years ago, the dancers echo and follow the complex cycles of
repetition executed by their screen counterparts. Philip Glass's ensemble
score grows wearisome, limiting the progression of Childs' response in a
more insidious manner than the Ligeti and Xenakis compositions of her later
dances. But there is much to savour in the perfect alliance and sometimes
hypnotic interaction between film and movement here.
Unfortunately, such fine-tuned synchronisation tends to bring out the worst
in some viewers. At a lecture given by Childs, an elderly gentleman
expressed concern that Childs happens to blink, when otherwise stationary,
on LeWitt's film. 'Was this intentional?' he queried.
'Well,' answered a completely unruffled Childs, 'I suppose you have to allow
for biological accidents - like breathing.' Like her comments, Childs'
dances leave you either fascinated or alienated.
Lucinda Childs Dance Company appears at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, 18-20
October, as part of the Dance Umbrella festival

FT  31 AUG 94 / Arts: The Cleveland Orchestra - Promenade concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Cleveland Orchestra must have been a bit surprised when the Prommers on
Saturday night gave it politely moderate applause for Dvorak's New World
Symphony and saved their thunder for Harrison Birtwistle's Earth Dances.
Forty minutes of continuous attention calls either for protest or release,
so release it was. Originally commissioned for the BBC Symphony Orchestra,
the music expressed - at least in this performance - not so much the
corybantic celebrations relentless march of some lumbering behemoth with a
gaggle of percussion (six players) persistently snapping at its heels and
eventually bringing it, after much minatory stuttering, to a halt. Only a
few people fled before Birtwistle's heavy hand had a chance to tighten its
grip.
The Cleveland Orchestra established its international reputation under the
formidable George Szell, its music director for 24 years until his death in
1970. Szell was renowned for his austere discipline in the Austro-German
classics, and the orchestra's current conductor, Christoph von Dohnanyi, is
a respectful heir to that tradition, less remarkable for the warmth of his
interpretations than for their clean efficiency.
There was not much to make you sit up suddenly in the way he conducted the
New World Symphony, though in the first movement he got the strings to bend
the rhythmic shape of the 'Swing Low' theme in exactly the same way each
time it occurred, which seemed merely a token gesture of artistic licence.
In the Scherzo and Finale, counter melodies on the trumpet usurped the
limelight - a sign that the conductor's ear may have tired of the main
business, for in music as hackneyed as this, it is tempting to look for the
inessential. However many times the orchestra may have already played Dvorak
on its current tour, this certainly did not sound like the freshest
performance, nor the most deeply felt.
The only bit of genuine American music in the Cleveland's two weekend
concerts was Charles Ives's eerily descriptive Central Park in the Dark,
which came before the Dvorak - not the best concert opener for an audience
still coughing tea or supper out of its system.
Sunday evening's programme began with Webern's arrangement of the six-part
Ricercar from Bach's Musical Offering - less of an orchestration than an
analysis by instrumentation. Bach was then recalled in the playful Cubist
mannerisms of Stravinsky's violin concerto, performed by the young German
violinist Christian Tetzlaff with a fine blend of crisp wit and immaculate
silky tones.
But we were in another world altogether with Mahler's First Symphony after
the interval. The Cleveland players gave it their well-honed best; yet
still, to a work which is so personal and richly evocative, from the
magically retrospective opening in which Mahler harks back to the sound of
the countryside in which he was born, through the grotesque, fearful
surrealism of the slow movement, to the flailing, tragic heroics of its
finale, Dohnanyi's approach was more than a touch clinical. There was
certainly no mud on his boots in Mahler's uncouth, rustic Scherzo, even if
the eloquent expressiveness of Dohnanyi's gestures in the central Trio
section did not seem to translate into orchestral effect. Which suggests,
perhaps, that well trained as the Cleveland is, it is neither to be shaken
nor stirred.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Arts: 'Rebecca' still thrills - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two birds with one stone. First I read Daphne du Maurier's novel Rebecca,
which is so sensitively written that it deserves all the praise it has ever
been given. Then I went to Bath, where Rebecca the play is at the Theatre
Royal, which must be one of the most pleasant theatres in the country.
Unsubsidised, it lives nowadays mainly on touring productions, sponsorship
and making its excellent facilities available for other activities. The
theatre even has its own pub, named appropriately The Garrick's Head.
Du Maurier's novel was published in 1938. It was so successful that she
herself produced a dramatised version, starring Margaret Rutherford as the
sinister Mrs Danvers, a year later. The movie, directed by Alfred Hitchcock,
came around the same time.
There is no great point in comparisons. They are simply different treatments
of broadly the same material and each stands in its own right. The novel is
written in the first person by the second Mrs de Winter. It is more the tale
of one girl's experience than of a wider society. Du Maurier did not even
give her a first name.
The play is more Agatha Christie than a subjective piece seen through one
set of eyes. Yet the suspense is still there. Note in this production the
frisson that goes through the audience as the curtain rises for the second
act with Mrs Danvers in black at the top of the stairs and a frightened Mrs
de Winter at the bottom: the frivolities are over.
Note, too, the way some of the twists of the plot of the novel are made more
dramatic by shortening. A possible motive for a verdict of suicide on
Rebecca is established by a couple of telephone calls, not by a long trip
from Cornwall to London. All this is done while keeping a large part of the
original dialogue, though sometimes the order is changed. It is clearly what
du Maurier wanted to do to her own work.
There is a single set, designed by Allen Miller-Bunford, of the hall at
Manderley, the remote stately home of Maxim de Winter. Since the Bath
theatre is itself rather elegant, that is all that is required to convey the
opulence of the house. Moreover, it is opulence without ostentation. Nothing
in Hugh Wooldridge's production is crude; the lighting, so important to the
plot and the nuances, never falters. The entire cast - and this is a rare
compliment - seem born to the social class they have to play: masters,
servants and inbetweens.
In the novel Maxim seems a bit of a shadowy figure. On stage, played by
Patrick Mower, he emerges as central. A consequence is that Carolyn
Backhouse's Mrs de Winter falls a little into the background, yet this is
entirely suitable to the drama. After all, it is not Mrs de Winter who has
committed a crime, nor is she the star attraction at Manderley. Ms Backhouse
accepts this slight demotion from her role in the book with great dignity.
Under E&amp;B Productions Rebecca runs at Bath for the rest of this week, then
has outings at Norwich, Sheffield, Nottingham, Aberdeen and a string of
other regional theatres. Catch it where you can.

How low can BBC1 sink? It screens a new cringe show today in which a search
will be made for 'Britain's most useless woman'. What disgraceful male
chauvinist piggishness ..Whoops] Sorry, it actually says 'Britain's most
useless man', so that's all right. Called The Opposite Sex the programme is
produced and presented by Chris Tarrant, star 12 years ago of 'OTT', which
stood for 'Over The Top' where people were covered in custard and so on. It
was scrapped by Bob Phillis, then head of Central TV, now Deputy
Director-General of the BBC. Today's show is largely devoted to couples
'airing their dirty laundry in public' (8.30).
The 40-minute drama 'Low Level Panic' in the BBC2 series Stages stars
Charlotte Coleman as one of three flatmates who spend much of the time in
their bathroom (9.25). Desmond Morris ends his series about The Human Animal
with a programme on playfulness (9.30 BBC1). That is followed by two more
repeats from the ATV stockpile: Roger Moore and Tony Curtis as The
Persuaders and Richard Bradford in Man In A Suitcase (10.20).

FT  31 AUG 94 / Business and the Environment: Simply take one washing
machine - Hard plastic waste can now be recycled into gasoline and heavy oil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If plastics are made from petroleum, why not turn plastic waste back into
fuels? For the environmental engineers at Toshiba, the Japanese electronics
group, the concept was easier conceived than done.
Many Japanese companies have managed to turn non-chloride plastics, such as
polyethylene, into petroleum fuels through heat processing.
But breaking down chloride-based hard plastics, such as those used for
computers and refrigerators, is more difficult because the process gives off
harmful hydrogen chloride gas as a by-product.
The demand for plastic recycling technology has risen in the past few years
in Japan with the gradual decline in landfill space for garbage and the rise
in industrial waste, of which over 5 per cent is plastics.
Moreover, electronics makers face increasing pressure from the government to
dispose of their own products thrown away by consumers.
From next March, electronics companies are required to help municipal
governments which do not have the capability to dispose of discarded bulk
consumer electronics goods such as refrigerators and washing machines.
In 1990, Toshiba initiated a development programme for recycling chloride
plastics, which account for 25 per cent of all plastics. Researchers at its
environmental technology laboratory, set up a year earlier to answer the
government's call for industry's greater involvement in waste disposal, led
the technology development.
'It's the same as throwing away an energy source,' says Kazuo Suzuki, head
of the environmental engineering lab.
After two years of experimental work, Toshiba's environmental researchers
discovered that adding a high-density alkaline solution when heating the
chloride plastics turned the hydrogen chloride into a harmless salt.
The solution also removes plastic additives which prevent heat
decomposition, increasing the fuel obtained from the heating process.
The new technology can be applied to more than 90 per cent of all plastics,
the proportion that decomposes when heated. In addition, small metal parts
which are difficult to detach from hard plastics do not need to be removed.
Earlier this month, Toshiba's environmental engineers launched a
demonstration plant that breaks down the plastics into fuel, salt, soda and
carbon dioxide.
Toshiba's development also solves the problem of having to separate chloride
and non-chloride plastics. In spite of the previously developed technology,
reclaiming fuels from non-chloride plastics had not been practical since
many products use both types of plastics and separating the two took time
and was costly.
The prototype system produces more than 200 litres of fuel out of 250kg of
plastic in 11 hours. After the plastics are decomposed, pressures and
temperatures in the combustion chambers can be adjusted to create several
kinds of fuel, including heavy oil, kerosene and gasoline.
Toshiba says there has been great interest in its new technology. The
company has received inquiries from German and other European companies in
plastic moulding and plastic board manufacturing industries.
Aside from the environmental benefits, there are also cost advantages. For
example, Toshiba currently pays Y50,000 (Pounds 330) to dispose of 1 tonne
of industrial waste. Since the company throws away 4,000 to 5,000 tonnes of
plastic garbage a year, it could save up to Y250m a year by using the fuel
reclaiming technology.
The company expects it to take a year to refine the demonstration plant
further into a smaller and more durable device and sell the product
commercially.
Toshiba says it will use the reclaimed fuel in its plants, and will also
sell it to its chemical manufacturing affiliates. The company believes its
system will be appropriate for medical equipment makers and hospitals, which
use large amounts of chloride plastics. Disposable plastic medical equipment
used in the company's in-house high-technology hospital will also be turned
into fuels.

FT  31 AUG 94 / People: Richardson steams on at Port of London
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Trade must be picking up at the Port of London Authority. For the first time
in its history it has hired a retired admiral to be its chief harbour
master.
Admittedly, Bruce Richardson, 52, is only a rear admiral. But he belongs to
a fast-dwindling breed. Ten years ago the Royal Navy had 34 rear admirals.
Currently, there are 24 and the number is falling by around one a year, in
line with the shrinkage in the size of Britain's Royal Navy.
Richardson, below, who takes over from Captain Gordon Varney, spent 32 years
with the Royal Navy, mostly at sea. However, it was during one of his first
shore jobs - as Britain's naval attache in Moscow - that he first hit the
headlines. He was ordered to leave the Soviet Union in 1982 as a retaliatory
move after Captain Anatoli Zatov, the Soviet Naval attache, had been
expelled from London.
In 1985 his diplomatic and linguistic skills were recognised when he was put
in charge of Nato's Standing Naval Force Atlantic - a multinational fleet of
nine warships.
By 47 he was a rear admiral and his last command was the First Flotilla
comprising 47 destroyers/frigates and 11,000 men.
By contrast, he will have a much smaller fleet at his disposal in his new
command.
But size does not reflect the importance of the job - maintaining the health
of 150 km of the River Thames and overseeing the safety of 25,000 shipping
movements a year.
The Pounds 45,000 a year job also has a ceremonial side, since the Royal
Nore, which the Queen uses when travelling on the river, comes within his
new fleet of patrol craft, barges, driftwood collectors, and salvage
vessels.
John Gracie, 50, has been appointed the new chief executive of Oldham
Training and Enterprise Council.
Gracie, the former chief executive of Qualitec, in St Helens, will be the
third chief executive of the Tec, which was set up in 1991.
He succeeds Lynne Clough, 36, who has been the acting chief executive, and
who did not wish to be considered for the post on a permanent basis.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Business and the Environment: Dam busters go into battle -
Environmentalists are trying to encourage salmon back to rivers in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Legend has it that 50 years ago, during the great salmon runs in the New
England state of Maine, a fisherman could stand knee-deep in a river, hold a
bucket and wait for the fish to jump in. These days, he would wait a long
time. Migrating salmon are rare in New England, and the situation is not
much better in the Pacific North-west.
According to the National Wildlife Federation, an environmental group,
migrating salmon populations in the Columbia and Snake rivers, for example,
have been reduced to 5 per cent of previous levels. To maintain populations,
the federation has adopted extreme measures such as capturing salmon, taking
them upstream by road to spawn, then bringing the offspring back down the
road again.
Environmentalists place the blame for the reduced stocks on dams, which
block the passage of the fish. 'We have a Dollars 200m (Pounds 130m)
programme in place to restore salmon fishing to at least sport fishing
levels over the next few years, and that effort is being seriously hampered
by dams,' says David Conrad, water resources specialist for the federation.
Concern over the environmental impact of dams is growing in the US, and
opponents have already won an important victory. Two dams on the Elwah river
in Washington state are about to become the first in the US to be pulled
down for environmental reasons.
Opposition is also building in other parts of the country. In Maine,
environmentalists are pressing the federal government not to re-license the
Edwards dam on the Kennebec River. In Michigan, environmentalists are
pushing at least two hydro-electric dams to be decommissioned.
In the 1960s and 1970s, ecologists promoted hydro-electric power as a clean
energy source that could save the earth from the ravages of coal and
oil-based electricity. In response, thousands of dams were erected around
the country.
Environmentalists find the campaign to reverse the impact of hydro-electric
dams no easy task. 'The Elwah dams took an act of Congress to decommission,'
says Ronald Wilson, attorney with the Sierra Club Legal Defence Fund, set up
by the Sierra Club environmental group. 'That can't happen every time we
want a dam taken out. We're going to have to find other legal routes to
getting dams decommissioned.'
Environmentalists hope they can convince the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC), which is in charge of dam licensing, to refuse permits on
ecological grounds.
As hydro-electric dams are destroyed, the government will have to find
alternative sources of energy. 'We have to remember that hydro-electric is
clean energy,' says Linda Church-Ciocci, executive director of the National
Hydropower Association. 'If we use more of other forms of energy, we'll have
a hard time meeting new emissions standards.'
There are other obstacles to tearing down dams. One is cost. The dismantling
of the Elwah river dams alone will cost Dollars 100m. Another barrier is the
ecological chaos that can be caused by dismantling a dam.
The mounds of silt and other deposits which build up behind dams could
threaten the environment if it is all released at once. Normally, the river
flow would flush the sediment downstream. Since the Elwah dams are likely to
be looked on as a model of dam removal, the government must proceed with
caution. To guard against disaster, engineers will probably use a
combination of methods to control the release of sediment. Vegetation will
be planted to keep some of the silt and sand in place. The old dam site may
be dredged and gravel, which salmon need to lay their eggs, may be
redeposited upstream.
Environmentalists believe fish stocks will begin to recuperate within a few
years on the Elwah. However, it may take 10 to 30 years for full restoration
of populations. The sediment will probably take this time to redistribute
and vegetation also needs time to grow.
However many problems the removal of the Elwah dams presents, ecologists say
they are nothing compared with the challenges other dams would pose. The
Elwah is set within the Olympic National Park and the sediment deposited
behind the dam is relatively pollution-free. Other sites, which operate
downstream from manufacturing companies, hold years of toxic waste in mounds
of sediment, which would wreak havoc if the dams were dismantled.
Regulators are now trying to work with dam owners, who accept there is an
environmental problem, to improve conditions for the wildlife. Temperatures
fluctuate greatly around dams, as the water builds up before release.
Temperature control devices improve the salmon's chances of survival as many
fish die because the water is too hot or too cold. Also, screens on turbines
help by preventing fish from being chopped up, and more fish ladders allow
greater numbers of fish to pass through.
It appears that the tide is turning on hydro-electric power. Hydro-electric
supporters complain it is extremely difficult to obtain permission for new
projects. Some 150 dams will see their licences expire over the next few
years, and with public pressure mounting, the federal government is likely
to consider environmental impact before renewing the licences. It may be
some time before fishermen can fill their buckets with salmon again, but
environmentalists are optimistic that in rivers where the dams are removed,
the fish will start jumping.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
David Farr, 39, has been appointed chief executive of Astec (BSR), the Hong
Kong-based and London-listed electronics company, 48.9 per cent owned by
Emerson Electric of the US.
He replaces George Tamke, 46, who becomes non-executive deputy chairman.
Tamke, chief executive since 1992, was instrumental in improving the
company's fortunes through a restructuring programme and by moving some of
its manufacturing bases from high cost to low cost countries, particularly
in south-east Asia.
Farr says he will pursue the strategy he inherits from Tamke. The company
has recently opened its second plant in Shenzhen, China and is set to open
one in the Philippines later this year.
Farr ran Emerson's mergers and acquisitions department between 1986 to 1989,
overseeing the Astec acquisition. He was president of Ridge Tool, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Emerson Electric, from 1989 to 1993. He has been
based in Hong Kong since taking up the post of president of Emerson Electric
Asia-Pacific last year.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Management: TUC tackles a 'slippery' idea - Some unions'
experience of human resource management is at odds with the hostile rhetoric
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To some people, human resource management is just a grandiose American term
for personnel management. To others, it is a significant departure. The
second camp falls into two categories: those for whom the current fashion
for HRM represents a belated rush towards enlightened management, and those
who see it as the cold manipulation of people as a resource to be managed
like any other.
Britain's trade union movement is belatedly just taking its first serious
and comprehensive look at the subject. Delegates at next week's Trades Union
Congress in Blackpool will debate a lengthy policy document that the TUC has
just produced*.
HRM appears to fill the TUC with suspicion, if not downright hostility. In
the words of the new report, 'it is a slippery concept that means different
things to different people'.
As the TUC says, in business school theory HRM is primarily about making the
best use of the skills of employees and placing the management of 'human
resources' at the centre of business planning. As the report puts it, 'on
this definition HRM may be associated with a range of techniques involving
changes in the methods used to communicate with workers, the organisation of
the workplace and payment systems'.
The main ingredients of HRM, as the TUC sees it, include teamworking,
quality circles, single status, lean production and just in time
manufacture, customer care training as well as performance-related pay,
profit sharing and share options. In essence, the report believes that the
HRM focus is 'on the individual rather than the collective body of workers'.
This differs sharply from traditional personnel management, in the TUC's
view. David Coates, the author of the TUC report, argues that HRM 'is
concerned with building a new workplace culture. Personnel management was
less comprehensive and not integrated into the production process'.
From the experience of its affiliate unions, the TUC believes that 'the
theory of HRM bears little relationship to the practice'.
'The language of HRM has been so abused by employers that the term may have
outlived its usefulness,' the report declares. 'The question now is better
posed in terms of how trade unions should engage with management change and
use that process to improve the working lives of our members.'
What particularly concerns the TUC is its conviction that HRM 'rhetoric has
often been used to conceal a deliberate anti-union policy'. In the minds of
many union leaders, HRM is associated with trade union derecognition in the
workplace by employers, and a resulting loss of union influence. But at the
same time the TUC accepts it cannot simply resist blindly what is happening
in the workplace. It agrees that unions must 'use the process of change to
deliver on trade union objectives'. Part of the trouble lies in a question
of definitions. The TUC seeks to distinguish between what it calls 'good'
and 'bad' HRM.
The former is concerned apparently with a corporate strategy to 'build a
world-class workplace'. As the TUC argues: 'The employer would be seeking to
improve performance by developing employee commitment. This would in turn
entail an extension of consultation with recognised trade unions, long-term
investment in training and a genuine attempt to develop social partnership.'
The TUC believes there are two 'bad' kinds of HRM. The first is 'the
piecemeal, ad hoc, unsystematic attempt to select items from the HRM menu in
the hope that this will improve the company's performance'. The second
involves an emphasis on individualising the employment relationship that
conceals a 'vigorous anti-union policy'. The TUC says many trade unionists
believe that HRM is 'nothing more than implementing redundancies,
casualising the workforce, reducing wages and reasserting management's right
to manage'.
In written evidence to the TUC on their experience of HRM, a number of trade
unions emphasised that while they may not like it, they have had to respond
pragmatically. 'Our view is that while HRM may be undesirable, the facts
have to be faced,' explained Terry Lane, the deputy general secretary of the
Engineers' and Managers' Association. 'HRM techniques are being put into
practice by employers and while they may not yield the results anticipated
by their advocates, the trade union roles should be to minimise their
detrimental effects. Our experience has been that if we were to try and
stand between our members and the prospects of improved rewards, respect and
support dwindles. Our members expect us to protect them and take steps as
are necessary to minimise any potential losses to them individually.'
A more positive and less defensive view came from Bill Jordan, the AEEU
engineering union's president. He told the TUC that his union had signed a
number of single union agreements with foreign companies like Nissan, Toyota
and Sony and that it had found 'their approach to HRM gave no reason for
complaint'.
'Team working, flexibility and multi-skilling have been central to the
competitive edge that these companies have established but they have never
sought to exploit their workforces by using these techniques,' he explained.
Jordan pointed out that quality circles and team-working implied
'consultation with the workforce as well as the devolution of power as far
as is practicable'. He instanced a deal with the Rover group in April 1992
as 'the first attempt of a British motor manufacturer to introduce HRM'. The
AEEU president conceded that some unions have had a negative experience of
HRM as a 'short cut to the shedding or exploitation of labour'. And 'sadly,
the AEEU has experience of working in these companies as well but this is no
reason, in itself, to reject the proper use of HRM,' he added.
'In reality companies will introduce these techniques regardless of our
opposition,' said Jordan. 'Let us not leave our shop stewards with the
unenviable task of trying to respond to change with no guidance or practical
support from their union or from the wider trade union movement'.
Other unions are hostile to HRM. The finance union Bifu told the TUC that
'the common themes running through most of the HRM techniques that have been
introduced are cost control, increased flexibility of resources and attempts
to marginalise the union role'. Nor was there much sign of enthusiasm for
HRM in the evidence to the TUC from the CPSA civil service union. It
complained that HRM posed 'a serious threat to collective bargaining
arrangements'.
Despite the criticisms and doubts about HRM, most of Britain's trade unions
are anxious to emphasise they want to co-operate with workplace innovation
and not resist change. In the TUC's document a number of case studies are
highlighted to illustrate this, most notably workplace reforms at Ford in
Bridgend, the Inland Revenue, British Telecom, and Lucas Flight Control
Systems in Wolverhampton.
The angry words of condemnation to be expected from the rostrum of congress
in Blackpool next week on the so-called iniquities of HRM will belie the
flexible and pragmatic way in which a growing number of unions are forming
partnerships with companies in the introduction of new working practices to
make business more competitive. Not for the first time in the trade unions,
the gap between rhetoric and practice is enormous.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Management: Equal treatment for gay staff - A look at US
companies offering health benefits for partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of US companies offering health insurance benefits to the
partners of gay and lesbian employees has snowballed since Lotus, the
Boston-based software company, began the practice two years ago.
Richard Jennings, executive director of Hollywood Supports, a gay rights
advocacy group, puts the number at almost 200. He says the benefit has
become standard in the computer and entertainment sectors, and in academia.
Apple Computer and Microsoft were quick to join Lotus. They have been
followed by HBO, Warner Brothers, Viacom, Paramount, Harvard University,
Yale University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and scores of
others.
Thirty-five municipalities, including Atlanta, Boston, Seattle, Los Angeles
and San Diego, now offer employees the option. In July, Vermont became the
first state to do so.
The practice is also affecting the media sector, with the New York Times,
the Seattle Times and the Los Angeles Times considering similar benefits.
According to gay rights groups, smaller companies are also starting to offer
insurance.
Providing health insurance for gay and lesbian partners is gaining ground
for several reasons. Most obvious is that companies say it is a good way of
attracting and keeping valuable homosexual employees. The incidence of gay
and lesbian advocacy groups within companies has also increased the pressure
for such benefits. 'That was their main complaint,' says Randy Massengale,
senior manager of diversity at Microsoft. 'They felt they were not being
treated equally.'
The benefits also make it easier for companies to market to gay and lesbian
consumers, who have become expert at organising boycotts of products from
companies that do not furnish insurance. 'The more companies that offer
these benefits, the harder it becomes not to do so,' says Jennings. 'There
is a lot of pressure especially on the Fortune 500 and on food and retail
groups.'
Following suit is proving a surprisingly cheap way for companies to improve
relations with the homosexual community. Microsoft says the benefits have
inflated its health insurance cost by just 1 per cent, because so few
employees take up the offer. Gay rights activists say that is because the
domestic partners of homosexuals usually work, and are likely to have
coverage through their own job.
Also, the benefits do not receive equal treatment under federal tax laws,
which consider health insurance of homosexual partners as taxable income.
Other disincentives to accepting the benefits may be reluctance to come out,
or a simple desire to keep their private life private. 'We find that many
employees may be openly gay, but are anxious to keep their home life to
themselves,' says Evan Wolfson, a senior staff attorney with the Lambda
Legal Defence, which has championed gays' health insurance rights in the
courts.
Others may be reluctant to sign up because companies often require employees
taking advantage of the benefit to register legally as domestic partners.
Although homosexuals cannot marry in the US, a number of municipalities
offer legal registration, which carries property rights implications.
Most local governments furnishing the benefits have also extended the offer
to the unmarried domestic partners of heterosexuals. Their logic is that
unmarried heterosexuals who live together should have the same options as
homosexual partners. Companies, however, tend to limit the practice to gays
and lesbians. 'There is always the argument that heterosexuals can legally
marry,' says Massengale.
By offering the benefit, companies run the risk of backlash. Conservative
citizens of Williamson County in Texas tried stop Apple Computer setting up
an office there because of the company's accommodation of gay and lesbian
employees.
But the county relented when Apple threatened to indeed move elsewhere, and
other companies say they have encountered little resistance.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Ceasefire will bring political challenges: White House at
'fever pitch'; Paisley demands talks at Number 10; Reynolds briefs Irish
cabinet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The question on everyone's lips in Whitehall yesterday was not whether there
would be an IRA ceasefire but whether it would be permanent.
As speculation that an announcement was imminent reached fever pitch,
Downing Street drummed out the message that it has stuck to consistently
since last December's Downing Street declaration - that only a permanent end
to violence was good enough.
Yet there was no denying that even a temporary ceasefire would subject all
parties in the conflict to intense new pressures.
If the cessation of IRA violence were permanent, London has promised that it
would be ready to enter into 'preliminary exploratory dialogue' with Sinn
Fein, the IRA's political wing, within three months.
In a letter to Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, in April, Downing Street
explained that this dialogue would have three purposes:
To explore the basis on which Sinn Fein would be admitted to an 'inclusive
political talks process'. To exchange views on how Sinn Fein would be able
in time to play the same part as the current constitutional parties in
Ulster's public life. To examine the practical consequences of ending
violence.
What is not clear is the attitude London would take to the highly sensitive
subject of handing in weapons. Downing Street said yesterday it would expect
'the law of the land' to be observed, apparently leaving the door open for
paramilitaries with firearms licences to keep their weapons.
Also unclear are the questions of the treatment of IRA prisoners and the
extent to which the army would be withdrawn from Ulster's streets.
When the issue of prisoners has arisen before, London has been quick to rule
out the notion that there could be a general amnesty, while emphasising that
it is normal to consider a prisoner's likeliness to reoffend when deciding
how long he or she should serve.
Until loyalist paramilitaries abandon their armed campaign, the need for a
significant security presence will remain, although it is reasonable to
expect this to be re-oriented towards countering the loyalist threat.
Work would continue, meanwhile, on the joint framework document London and
Dublin expect to inject fresh impetus into political talks. Optimists think
this could be completed as soon as next month.
A permanent end to IRA violence would also be expected rapidly to earn Sinn
Fein an invitation to Mr Reynolds's pet project, the Forum for Peace and
Reconciliation, referred to in the joint declaration. The forum's aim would
be to make recommendations on ways in which agreement and trust between both
traditions in Ireland could be promoted and established.
London would have to work hard to reassure unionists - and sceptical
Conservative backbenchers - about the direction events were taking.
If the IRA declared a ceasefire which was not permanent, it would, on the
face of it, fall short of London and Dublin's demands and be insufficient to
break the stalemate.
Realistically, however, it would put both governments under immense pressure
to respond with conciliatory gestures aimed at convincing republican leaders
to make the ceasefire permanent. The longer the ceasefire lasted - perhaps
accompanied by a second high-profile visit to the US by Mr Adams - the more
these pressures would grow and the harder it would become for the two
governments to maintain a united front.
The republican strategy would probably be to emphasise continually how
difficult it had been to convince hawks in the movement to lay down their
arms, while exploiting any opportunity to drive a wedge between London and
Dublin.
Under such circumstances, the attitude of the US government could have a
crucial bearing on whether London and Dublin ultimately decide to deviate
from their present stance.
In the short term, the two governments would probably be at pains to signal
that the political process was moving ahead satisfactorily in spite of Sinn
Fein's continued absence. This could best be demonstrated by early
completion of the framework document.
But a non-permanent ceasefire would put republican leaders under pressure
too, because it is far from clear how patient IRA hawks would be if a
significant period elapsed without government concessions. Continuing
loyalist attacks would serve only to make IRA trigger fingers more itchy.
The Sinn Fein leadership is well aware that a legacy of the indefinite
ceasefire declared in 1975 was a murderous feud between the official IRA and
the provisionals which weakened the movement for years.
With the diligence and determination of the latest UK-Irish initiative
having served to expose the IRA's isolation, republican leaders know that if
another similar split were provoked, there would be no comebacks.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Dublin optimistic on permanent end to IRA violence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
There was rising optimism in Dublin last night that an imminent IRA
ceasefire announcement would go further than anticipated and be a
declaration of IRA intent to permanently end its 25-year military campaign
against Britain's presence in Northern Ireland.
The Irish cabinet was briefed yesterday afternoon by Mr Albert Reynolds, the
prime minister, and Mr Dick Spring, the foreign minister, who through
informal channels have been informed of the latest developments in
republican thinking.
After the meeting a government spokesman said: 'We are hopeful that what we
are going to hear will be a permanent cessation of violence.' He said that
Dublin's understanding of the announcement was that it would be permanent.
The spokesman added: 'There are no pacts, no deals and no terms. They are
making their decision in the light of the current political situation.'
Mr Reynolds said last night: 'I believe we are poised for peace and that in
a very short time we will be able to make an entirely new beginning in the
island . . . a complete cessation of violence and the principles of the
Downing Street declaration are our new starting point.'
The growing hopes follow Monday night's comments by Mr Gerry Adams that he
had told the IRA leadership he believed the time was right for a truce.
Mr John Hume, the leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and
Labour party who held talks with Mr Adams at the weekend, said yesterday:
'Our objective is a total cessation of violence and surely everybody wants
to see that.'
Dublin now has a delicate balancing act to play in the event of an IRA
ceasefire. It must try and reassure the Northern Ireland unionists that they
are not about to be forced into a united Ireland.
At the same time Dublin must also reassure Sinn Fein and the IRA that a
permanent cessation of violence will bring a rapid incorporation of Sinn
Fein into negotiations through the Forum of Peace and Reconciliation, as
laid out in last December's Downing Street declaration.
The aim of the forum will be to bring together the different strands of
nationalism throughout Ireland and attempt to create a united front for
future all-party negotiations.
A statement by Mr Reynolds last Sunday clearly alluded to this. He said: 'It
remains my view, both as Taoiseach (prime minister) and as leader of Fianna
Fail that in the longer term a united Ireland achieved by agreement offers
the best and most durable basis for peace and stability.' He went on to rule
out any return to 'majoritarian rule' in Northern Ireland.
The tone of that statement is being seen as a firm message to Sinn Fein that
the nationalist agenda will be vigorously pursued by the Irish government,
the SDLP and Sinn Fein, in the event of an end to violence.
That scenario has alarmed unionists however, who are already divided in
their approach to the peace process. They fear that a deal has been done
between London and Dublin, and that they will be left isolated.
In an attempt to allay these fears, the Irish government, Mr Hume and Mr
Adams have all stressed in recent days that any future constitutional
changes in Northern Ireland would require agreement with the unionists
through a process of negotiation and dialogue.
Mr Spring said yesterday: 'Nobody has anything to fear from a cessation of
violence.'

FT  31 AUG 94 / Ulster Unionist leader accepts Major's pledge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, said yesterday he
was confident that the government had no plans to change Northern Ireland's
constitutional position - 'contrary to wild speculation over the weekend'.
The measured tone of his remarks was echoed by Mr John Taylor, UUP MP for
Strangford, who warned against premature reaction by unionists.
But the hardline Democratic Unionist party warned of fresh trouble in the
event of new government concessions.
The Rev Ian Paisley, the DUP leader, angrily demanded a meeting with Mr John
Major, saying a truce based on a British 'surrender' could lead to fresh
strife.
He said: 'Any government that subverts the democratic wish of the people and
goes against all the pledges they have made is going to have a situation
which is a recipe for civil war in Northern Ireland.'
The Ulster MPs' comments came after a statement on Monday night by Mr Gerry
Adams had raised mounting expectations of a ceasefire still higher.
In his first public acknowledgement that he had advised IRA leaders to
consider halting their 25-year armed campaign, Mr Adams said he had always
argued that a 'changed political climate could break the . . . stalemate and
create the potential to eradicate the underlying causes of conflict.
'In my updated assessment to the IRA leadership I expressed my belief that
the current political climate provides that potential.'

FT  31 AUG 94 / Radio to broacast location finder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A broadcasting company which plans to use the latest radio technology to
provide precise location information is hoping to take to the airwaves in
the UK soon.
Differential Corrections, a US-owned company, was the only bidder for a
special Radio Authority licence. It bid Pounds 1,000 for the first
additional service licence to be advertised by the authority.
If successful its service will be carried on spare capacity on the Classic
FM signal.
The location information is used by everyone from surveyors to transport
companies all over the world. The company, which prefers to be known as DCI,
has spotted a business opportunity in correcting, for private and commercial
subscribers, deliberate distortions in the Global Positioning System. This
is a system of 24 satellites maintained by the US Defense Department which
allows users to determine their position in the world to an accuracy of
about 100 metres.
The accuracy level is partly determined by ionospheric delays but also
because of errors deliberately added for military security reasons. There
was a fear that a system that was too accurate could be used by hostile
ballistic missiles to target military bases. Civil use on the back of radio
broadcasts is apparently of no use to ballistic missiles.
Differential Corrections, which is planning to launch all over Europe, will
offer subscribers three different services, providing accuracy to one, five
or 10 metres. The company believes the main markets for the services will
include vehicle and marine navigation, vehicle location systems and
geographic information systems.
Mr David Scaman, director of European operations, said yesterday: 'I think
there is very large market potential in providing accurate locational and
navigational systems.'
Subscribers are able to get access to the information using FM receivers
about the size of a pager. The information is carried on the radio signal
using Radio Data System technology, which allows the radio signal to
transmit digital data.
DCI, which launched in the US six months ago, operates from 53 radio
stations, with a further 50 in the process of being connected. It is also
carrying out test transmissions in Norway.
The company said that Trimble Navigation, the world's largest manufacturer
of GPS receivers, is already incorporating DCI technology into its next
generation designs. Once activated the FM data receivers automatically tune
to the strongest correction signal, decode the data and give the more
precise location to the GPS receivers.
The Radio Authority said yesterday it hoped to announce the award of the
licence within two months.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Strikebreakers keep 47% of railways open
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Railtrack said 47 per cent of the network remained open once signal workers
had begun their third 48-hour stoppage yesterday in their 12-week dispute
over pay.
The proportion of the network kept open was the best achieved by Railtrack,
the state-owned rail infrastructure company, on any strike day. However, the
number of trains which ran - 45 per cent - was about the same as last week.
The latest strike is due to run until noon tomorrow and will be followed by
a 24-hour stoppage next Thursday - during the Trades Union Congress in
Blackpool.
The RMT transport union said the strike was still 'solidly supported'. Mr
John Ellis, Railtrack's production manager, agreed yesterday that the strike
had not yet 'crumbled'.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, attacked an offer by Railtrack to its
managers, inspectors and supervisors of free trips to Paris and Brussels
next month on the Channel tunnel Eurostar service, which is not yet open to
the public.
Mr Knapp said the company's reward for 'strikebreakers' might have been
better spent on trying to resolve the grievances of the signal workers. He
pointed out that the offer was not available to non-RMT signalling staff who
had been working through the dispute.
Dr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, called on the signal workers
yesterday to urge their union to go back into negotiation.
He said: 'I hope the signalmen will ask their union for how much longer the
railway industry must suffer while its passengers and freight users desert,
and what will be the long-term effect of this on their jobs.'
In a bulletin sent to signal workers yesterday, Railtrack warned there were
only 24 working days left to settle their grievances and improve their
pension benefits by up to Pounds 50m.
The British Rail Pension Fund actuary has confirmed that the deadline to
agree the restructuring package for signal workers and secure the millions
reserved to meet the costs of upgrading pensions is September 30. 'If that
dealine passes Railtrack's pension fund will lose that money', Railtrack
warned.
The bulletin said 105 signal workers were due to retire between September
1995 and September 1996, and they would suffer a fall in the value of their
pensions if there were no deal by the end of next month.
Mr David Armstrong, Railtrack's human resources director, said yesterday:
'For them and many that will receive these benefits in the future, the 30
September deadline is vital.'

FT  31 AUG 94 / Deal may trigger extra US cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
White House officials are now at 'not much less than fever pitch', say
Washington diplomats, over the improved prospects for peace in Northern
Ireland, and members of the US Congress are confident of an IRA ceasefire.
The administration of President Bill Clinton is also considering an aid
package to help buttress a ceasefire, although no details have yet been
worked out.
'There are a number of options to provide aid to Ireland already. We won't
make any decision on what to do until we see exactly what the terms of the
ceasefire are,' said Ms Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, who
was accompanying Mr Clinton on his holiday in the Massachusetts coastal
resort of Martha's Vineyard.
Congressional aides said any request for more money to accompany a peace
agreement would probably receive considerable support, but that no specific
package was yet circulating for discussion.
The US currently gives Dollars 20m (Pounds 12.9m) a year to the
International Fund for Ireland, which is jointly administered by the UK and
Ireland.
Some members of Congress criticised the appropriation each year, on the
grounds that the fund seemed less deserving than some developing countries
whose aid has been cut. But no substantial opposition is expected, even for
a much larger sum, if there seems a real prospect of peace in Northern
Ireland.
The US also allowed a veteran Irish republican activist into the country
yesterday on a special visa as hopes for a breakthrough rose.
Mr Joe Cahill, a founding member of the Irish Republican Army who was
reprieved in 1942 after being sentenced to death for killing a policeman,
arrived in New York yesterday after Mr Clinton personally approved a request
for a waiver from immigration laws that would otherwise have excluded him
because of past terrorist activities.
The visa is the first the Clinton administration has granted to an Irish
republican since the row over the visit in February of Mr Gerry Adams. US
officials were disappointed then by Mr Adams's failure to renounce violence.
Hopes for a ceasefire have risen in the US after the visit to Ireland last
week of a delegation headed by Mr Bruce Morrison, a former congressman with
close ties to the Clinton administration. Mr Morrison, although expected to
report to the White House, stressed he was not an official representative of
Mr Clinton.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Student total in England increases 9%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The total number of students in English higher education rose by 9 per cent
to 1.177m last year, according to statistics released by the Department for
Education.
New entrants rose by 5 per cent to 580,000. A majority were 'mature
students', aged 21 or over. Since 1989, students enrolled for full-time
courses have risen by 55 per cent.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, education secretary, said: 'The university world no
longer caters for the privileged few. Five years ago, only one in six young
people entered higher education - today the figure is almost one in three.
Universities today cater for a greater variety, with more than a third
entering higher education to study part-time.'
She described higher education as an 'unsung success story', but added that
universities would continue evolving to offer 'more diversity and choice'.
The numbers entering for a first degree at or after the age of 25 have
increased by 146 per cent since 1989, from 14,500 to 35,800, while mature
students now account for 52.3 per cent of all new entrants below
postgraduate level - up from 49.2 per cent in 1989.
Women studying part-time appear to have accounted for the bulk of the
increase in mature students, with numbers doubling from 15,600 in 1989 to
31,800 last year.
A total of 47,200 students started on full-time postgraduate courses, a 65
per cent increase on 1989, while there was a 74 per cent increase in
part-time postgraduate courses over the same period.
Expansion was helped by foreign students. At postgraduate level new students
from other European Union countries rose 20 per cent, from 6,100 to 7,300,
while other foreign recruitment rose 14 per cent to 18,400.
At first-degree level, recruitment from the EU, which has been made easier
by the single-market regulations, rose 19 per cent to 7,500.
Mr Jim Murphy, president of the National Union of Students, said reductions
in funding per student were weakening academic quality. 'This is not a
success story . . . it is a sign of failure,' he said.
The government has announced a three-year period of 'consolidation'. Student
numbers will be capped at their present level and higher education
institutions will be penalised financially if they exceed their target
numbers for admissions. They are expected to achieve budget cuts of 10 per
cent during this period.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Changes in tax 'aid the childless'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Families with children have been the main losers from changes in the UK tax
system since 1985, say researchers from the Institute for Fiscal Studies.
An analysis of the changes, published today in the institute's journal
Fiscal Studies, says single people, pensioners and couples with no children
are largely better off as a result of the changes. Couples with children and
single-parent families are more likely to be worse off than to have gained.
On average earners with children gained from the changes by Pounds 6 a week
for households with one earner. However, more than two out of three such
households were worse off, since all the gains went to a minority.
Families have been particularly hard hit by the imposition of value added
tax on domestic fuel and the reduction in mortgage interest tax relief, the
institute says.
Pensioners have done better than average because of the compensation package
for VAT on fuel they will receive through the social security system. They
are also less likely to use tobacco and petrol, on which excise duties have
risen steeply in real terms since 1985.
The article by Mr Chris Giles and Mr Paul Johnson compares the effects of
the tax system as it will be in 1995 with the tax system as it was in 1985
updated to reflect price inflation since then. The figures are calculated
using a representative sample of the UK population to model the tax changes.
The changes have made the richest 60 per cent of households better off and
the poorest 40 per cent worse off, the article says. Three-quarters of the
money spent on tax cuts since 1985 has gone to the richest 10 per cent.
The tax system in 1995 will be much less progressive than it was 10 years
earlier, the IFS says. This is partly because of the shift from direct taxes
such as income tax to indirect taxes such as VAT and excise duties.
Indirect taxes are particularly regressive, the IFS says. The richest tenth
of households pay 8 per cent of their income in such taxes, while the
poorest tenth pay 20 per cent.
The changes since 1985 have increased the after-tax income of the top tenth
by 5.8 per cent and reduced those of the bottom tenth by 2.9 per cent.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Court upholds ban on music company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A music company was yesterday denied its attempt in the High Court to
release its records from an alleged monopoly of distribution outside the US.
American Recordings, the US recording label formerly known as Def American,
had sought an injunction to overturn a ban imposed by the Mechanical
Copyright Protection Society on sales of its albums in the UK.
The ban was enacted on behalf of Phonogram, the UK unit of PolyGram, the
music and film group in which Philips of the Netherlands has a majority
stake.
Phonogram claimed American had violated a joint-venture agreement in which
it was named as sole distributor for American's artists outside the US.
Earlier this month Phonogram dropped a case against American in the UK and
instead launched a claim for punitive damages in the California courts. The
US action also seeks to restrain American from entering into a distribution
agreement with any other company until the dispute is resolved.
The Phonogram action is a countersuit to a Dollars 14m (Pounds 9m) case
brought by American. It has said that Phonogram did not abide by the
agreement and that the company did not promote its artists as agreed, file
tax returns, pay royalties, or set up office space.
American filed the application against the ban in the UK because it believes
it is no longer bound by the agreement and should be allowed to distribute
outside the US.
Mr Justice Evans-Lombe ruled that without proceedings against American in
the UK there were no grounds for lifting the ban until the dispute was
settled.
American was awarded costs for its defence against Phonogram's abandoned
High Court action.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Private prison services attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A United Nations committee is to be asked to consider whether Britain's
development of privately managed prisons contravenes international law.
The Howard League for Penal Reform has submitted a document to the United
Nations Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of
Minorities, alleging financial and humanitarian failures in Britain's
commercially managed prisons. It complains of a series of failings including
poor regimes for inmates, financial profligacy, obsessive secrecy, suicides
and disturbances.
Ms Frances Crook, Howard League director, said yesterday that the government
had failed to develop a coherent penal policy and was trying to conceal this
by 'handing over prisoners to commercial companies' whose main motive was
financial gain. She added: 'The Howard League considers commercial prisons
to be immoral, impracticable, and contrary to international law.'
If the UN sub-commission supports its view, the league might consider legal
action against the government.
Privately run prisons have been established in other countries - notably the
US - for some years. US private prison operators have been part of groups
bidding to manage UK prisons.
Britain has three privately managed prisons and the contract to run a
fourth, Buckley Hall at Rochdale, was awarded last month. Private-sector
groups are preparing proposals to finance, build and manage prisons at
Liverpool and in south Wales, and private bids to manage some existing
public prisons are to be invited.
The Prison Service says the process of market testing prison management is
leading to imaginative bids from both the private and public sectors which
offer enhanced regimes for prisoners.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Rover leads rise in car output with 20% surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rover, the leading UK carmaker, increased vehicle production 20.8 per cent
year-on-year in the first six months of 1994, the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders says.
Overall UK car output rose 1.2 per cent in the first half to 751,717 from
742,969 in the same period a year ago, but the society forecasts that growth
in production will accelerate during the second half of the year.
Higher output by Rover, a subsidiary of BMW of Germany, together with the
build-up of production by Toyota and Honda at their UK assembly plants,
helped to offset declines at Ford, Vauxhall and Peugeot and a sharp fall in
production at Nissan.
The rise in Rover car and commercial vehicle output - to 251,947 from
208,521 a year ago - has been helped most importantly by the introduction of
its Rover 600 executive car range, launched in spring last year, as well as
by rising sales of the Land Rover Discovery.
The company has announced it is investing Pounds 68m to expand Discovery
production by 20 per cent to 1,500 a week during the autumn.
Production at Nissan's Pounds 900m Sunderland plant fell by a third during
the first half of the year to 93,000 from 141,000 in the same period a year
ago.
The company was forced to halve production for nearly four months until
early March with the elimination of its second shift in order to cut stocks
and to bring output into line with sharply lower demand in continental
Europe.
Production at Toyota's Pounds 700m assembly plant at Burnaston, near Derby,
which began at the end of 1992, was almost tripled in the first half this
year to 43,000 from 15,000 a year ago.
The plant, which will have an eventual capacity of at least 200,000 cars a
year, is expected to produce more than 90,000 cars in 1994.
Production of commercial vehicles began to recover from recession during the
first six months, albeit from a very low level. Output in the first six
months, at 116,692, was 10.2 per cent higher than a year ago.
Commercial vehicle output has been in a state of almost continuous decline
since 1969 when it peaked at 466,000.
Production fell 22.2 per cent last year to 193,414, the lowest since 1948.

FT  31 AUG 94 / CMN offer for Swans disappoints receiver
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French company hoping to take over Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder
in receivership, yesterday came up with a last-minute proposal for its
conditional purchase.
Soffia/Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie (CMN) said it believed its new
offer, under which it would immediately begin paying Swans' design staff to
enable the company to tender for work, would provide a way to secure the
future of the yard.
But joint receiver Mr Gordon Horsfield of Price Waterhouse described the
latest proposal as disappointing, and said it appeared markedly less
attractive, not only for the receiver, but for the remaining 660 employees.
Under the new offer, he said, there appeared to be little job security for
the majority of the workforce.
It was also further below Swans' Pounds 7.2m break-up value: CMN had taken
the opportunity to reduce its offer both financially and qualitatively.
'It should be recalled that in the eyes of the receiver the previous offer
was, at best, threadbare,' added Mr Horsfield.
Price Waterhouse has lifted its deadline of today for the dismissal of
Swans' 100-strong design and technical team to allow time to consider the
revised offer.
A new deadline of September 9 has been imposed in the hope that negotiations
will bring an improvement, but Mr Horsfield warned: 'I certainly feel we are
reaching the end of the line with Soffia/CMN.'
He said the receivers would be talking to other parties who had expressed an
interest in Swans. It was possible one might make a 'late run' but he added:
'I wouldn't want anybody to build a lot of false hopes on that.'
CMN previously proposed it would take on Swans' existing Ministry of Defence
frigates contract, and sub-contract the work to the receiver, using the
balance of money to pay the design team's Pounds 200,000 wage bill until the
end of the year. This plan was halted by a deadlock over price with the MoD.
CMN will not buy Swans unless it has two years' workload. Mr Fred Henderson,
chairman of CMN Support Services in the UK, said the latest conditional
proposal included Pounds 5m for Swans' assets. He did not agree that the new
offer was poorer for the workforce.
He said the question of whether there would be redundancies after Swans'
last frigate left in November was one for the receiver. 'It's our view a
lay-off scheme should be utilised,' he said.
Mr Roger Freeman, defence procurement minister, welcomed news of a new offer
from CMN. However, unions at Swans, which will meet the receiver today,
reacted cautiously. Mr Dick Gonsalez, union leader, said they would only
discuss terms and conditions with CMN once it owned the business.
At a meeting with union leaders yesterday Mr Tony Blair, Labour leader,
agreed to write to Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Freeman urging
them to be constantly involved with matters at Swans.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Milk Marque offers price deal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Milk Marque, the farmers' co-operative which is to succeed the Milk
Marketing Board, yesterday offered dairy manufacturers an option which it
said could save 0.4p on the price of a litre until October next year.
Mr Andrew Dare, Milk Marque chief executive, said this 'should remove any
need to increase the price of a pinta in real terms during the next year'.
The move was seen as an attempt to limit the row over prices which dairy
manufacturers say will rise following deregulation of the market in
November.
However, the Dairy Trade Federation said the price change was a cosmetic
exercise which merely emphasised the power of a monopoly.

rise, which looks designed to increase the rate of payback of the more than
Pounds 1.75bn invested in the satellite television venture.
The rise is being added to all four tiers of subscriptions so that the basic
multi-channel package will in future cost Pounds 9.99. Multi-channel plus
one premium service, such as the Sports Channel or a film channel, will cost
Pounds 14.99, multi-channel plus two premium channels Pounds 19.99 and the
entire package Pounds 22.99.
BSkyB, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant
stake, had 3.45m subscribers at the end of June. If they all continue to
subscribe then the gross additional revenue over a year would be about
Pounds 125m.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Ballot at BBC on pay package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unions at the BBC will ballot their members on a compromise package on
performance pay and conditions of service thrashed out at the Acas
conciliation service last week, Raymond Snoddy writes.
The issues led to a number of one-day strikes at the BBC earlier in the
summer.
Mr Tony Lennon, president of Bectu, the main technical union, will tell
staff that on performance-related pay the offer is the best that can be
obtained by negotiation.
The unions say the BBC has modified its insistence that, after performance
reviews, pay rises can be withheld from staff whose work is unsatisfactory.
Under the new proposals a financial penalty of up to 4.5 per cent of salary
could be imposed for six months, subject to a six-month delay before being
imposed.
There are also extra commitments on what salaries new staff and the newly
promoted could expect to receive after initial training.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Tax measures 'will help cut gas emissions'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's decision to impose value added tax on domestic heating
bills and to make annual increases in road fuel duties will help it to meet
its target for cutting emissions of greenhouse gases, the Institute for
Fiscal Studies says today.
The institute says that the measures will 'make a substantial contribution
to reducing UK emissions of carbon dioxide'. It also predicts that the
government's target for stabilising emissions of carbon dioxide at 1990
levels by the year 2000 will be 'comfortably achieved', in large part
because of the fiscal measures.
In 1992 Mr John Major, the prime minister, committed the UK to freezing its
emissions of carbon dioxide at 1990 levels by the year 2000.
The fiscal measures adopted last year will add 'slightly' to inflation, the
institute says. But it suggests that they will have little impact on real
growth in gross domestic product or consumer expenditure because other tax
increases would have been forthcoming to cut the public sector borrowing
requirement.
The report notes, however, that a carbon tax, such as that proposed by the
European Commission, would be more effective in reducing harmful atmospheric
emissions. It describes the imposition of VAT on heating bills as a 'one-off
measure', which is unlikely to have much impact on the 'underlying long-term
growth of carbon dioxide emissions from households'.
The study also criticises the government's failure to provide a 'convincing
solution' to the problem of emissions from electricity generators and other
industries.
The government's plan to raise the rate of duty on road fuels by 5 per cent
a year in real terms is seen as an 'innovative approach' and will 'almost
certainly slow the growth of emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases
and associated social costs'.

Building new trunk roads does nothing to improve the economic performance of
towns and cities, says a report published today by Greenpeace, the
environmental group.
The report, by Mr John Whitelegg of environmental consultants Eco-Logica,
analysed the number of jobs created in 34 towns and cities in England and
Wales between 1985 and 1992. It says there is no relationship between job
opportunities in these areas and their distance from trunk roads.
Doncaster, less than 20 minutes from the M1 motorway, experienced a fraction
of the rise in job opportunities of Grimsby, 70 minutes from the M1, the
report says.

FT  31 AUG 94 / US may ease immigration for Cubans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US administration is considering relaxing immigration rules to allow
more legal Cuban immigrants, in return for a commitment from the Castro
government to halt the refugee exodus.
The US proposal could be put to Cuban government representatives at
migration talks to be held in New York tomorrow. Cuba yesterday said its
team would be led by Mr Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly
and a former foreign minister, in an indication of how seriously President
Fidel Castro's goverment is taking the opportunity to talk to the US.
However, the US is ruling out discussion of general issues despite President
Castro's calls for broader talks, including consideration of lifting the
trade embargo against Cuba. The Clinton administration has made it clear
that a future meeting on the broader issues of US-Cuba relations will depend
on a demonstration of goodwill by Cuba at the migration talks.
Mr Michael McCurry, US State Department spokesman, said the US intended 'to
solely focus. . . on the question of legal, safe and orderly migration from
Cuba', but acknowledged that the Cubans 'believe that there are other issues
that may be pertinent to this discussion, so we expect that they may bring
those up'.
The US offers visas for legal entry to more than 20,000 Cubans each year,
but residence visas were granted to fewer than 3,000 Cubans last year. Ms
Janet Reno, US attorney general, has repeatedly called on Cubans to pursue
legal avenues of immigration and desist from attempting to flee Cuba by
boat. Last week Mr Castro claimed the failure to grant more visas had helped
encourage the flood of people leaving by sea.
The plans to bend immigration rules could include a proposal to grant entry
to relatives (including cousins who normally do not qualify) of
Cuban-Americans and to offer refugee status to some Cubans even if they do
not meet the strict criteria.
Ms Reno's office was reported to be thinking of using emergency powers under
immigration laws to raise the number of Cubans admitted to the legal
ceiling. This could involve allowing some of the 19,700 Cubans waiting for
visas, some of them for as long as 10 years, to jump the queue and be
granted admission this year.
The number of Cubans attempting to cross the Straits of Florida in makeshift
rafts and boats dropped over the last few days because of bad weather, but
rose sharply again early yesterday.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Consumer confidence off peak in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Consumer confidence in the US dropped slightly in July and August after a
previous four-year high, according to the Conference Board's Consumer
Confidence Index issued yesterday.
The monthly index, produced by the New York-based business research group,
registered 89.0 in August, down from 91.3 in July and 92.5 in June.
The survey, based on a sample of 5,000 households, shows consumers are less
positive in their assessment of prevailing economic conditions and less
optimistic in their expectations for the month ahead.
The index, which is widely viewed as one of the better barometers of
consumer spending, reinforces the impression given by recent Commerce
Department figures that the pace of economic growth is slowing.
The number of respondents who reported in August that business conditions
were 'good' had decreased slightly and there was a drop in the number of
people who said jobs were 'plentiful'.
However, the survey also noted the numbers saying conditions were 'bad'
dropped marginally.
There was only a small change in predictions for the economy. The proportion
of households expecting the economy to improve was down slightly, but
optimists outnumbered pessimists by two to one.
Mr Fabien Linden, executive director of the Conference Board's consumer
research centre, was not too disheartened by the results. Although
confidence was lower than a month earlier, 'the present level of confidence
has been associated with a reasonably strong economy during the 27-year
history of the survey,' he said.
New home sales surged 8.3 per cent in July rebounding from a revised 11.4
per cent decline in June, the US Commerce Department announced yesterday.
The rise was in line with many analysts' expectations.
The Commerce Department also noted that sales of new homes during the first
seven months of 1994 were 6.6 per cent above the same period last year. The
median price of a new home declined to Dollars 123,000, down 6.1 per cent
from Dollars 131,000 in June.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Chile targets education as spending priority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chile is to make education its main spending priority over the next six
years as part of its strategy to 'cross the threshold' into the league of
developed nations, Mr Eduardo Aninat, finance minister, announced.
However, overall spending would henceforth increase at below the rate of
economic growth in a move aimed at tightening the fiscal policy inherited
from the previous administration. Business groups have frequently argued
that a policy of pitching spending increases at above the level of growth
was hindering the battle against inflation, stuck at a rate of around 12 per
cent.
The government had to 'prioritise' spending and show 'responsibility and
discipline,' Mr Aninat said in a presidential-style address broadcast on
Monday night. 'We cannot satisfy all demands at once, however legitimate
they may be.'
Greater spending on education would mean sacrifices elsewhere, although Mr
Aninat did not specify where these would come. Some savings could be made by
encouraging private-sector participation in infrastructure.
Spending on education would be raised gradually until it reached 7 per cent
of gross domestic product, a level comparable with that of Germany and the
UK. The government currently spends 5 per cent of GDP on an education system
generally believed to have stagnated over the past three decades.
Mr Aninat said creating a modern, properly funded education system was 'a
national task of the highest order'. Providing equal educational
opportunities was the best way of helping Chile's 4m poor to escape from
their present circumstances. President Eduardo Frei has pledged to eradicate
extreme poverty - which affects about 1m of the 13m population - by the year
2000.
In order to steer the economy away from dependence on commodities and to
launch the 'second phase' of development with greater emphasis on
value-added goods, Chile would need a well trained, adaptable and mobile
workforce, Mr Aninat said. Only thus could workers in uncompetitive
industries be retrained and relocated in more dynamic sectors.
Productivity must be raised by 3.5 per cent a year to achieve desired growth
rates of above 5.5 per cent. Such productivity gains were higher than
Chile's historical norms but in line with rates recorded in the past few
years.
Mr Aninat set out targets for the year 2000, including doubling exports to
Dollars 20bn (Pounds 12.9bn) and the creation of 500,000 jobs. Modernisation
must be funded mainly with domestic savings and not foreign debt, he said.
Given 5.5 per cent growth over the next six years, per capita income would
increase by nearly half to Dollars 4,700, he said - a realistic aim given
average growth rates of 6 per cent over the past decade.
'In terms of purchasing power, reaching this level of income would mean
attaining a standard of living just 5 per cent behind that enjoyed by Spain
today,' Mr Aninat said. 'We are not prepared to let this opportunity slip
by.'
Chile recalled its ambassador to Peru 'for consultations' on Monday after
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori withdrew a border treaty between the two
nations from congressional consideration, Reuter reports from Santiago. The
treaty was meant to settle disputes left over from a 1929 agreement on the
coastal border.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Quebec's Liberal premier, Mr Daniel Johnson, won on points in Monday night's
televised debate with Mr Jacques Parizeau, leader of the separatist Parti
Quebecois, but failed to score the knock-out blow needed for election
victory.
The PQ's lead in the opinion polls has been narrowed significantly in
several weeks of campaigning by Mr Johnson, who is more popular than Mr
Parizeau. But Monday's lengthy and technical debate, on which the Liberals
were resting great hopes, did little to further shift voter sentiment.
Recent opinion polls give the PQ a lead of between four and seven points,
ahead of Quebec's September 12 election. The staunchly federalist Liberals
need to pick up about 10 points in the polls to win a majority in the
125-seat National Assembly.
Among French speaking voters, the PQ leads by 20 points, and Francophones
make up 80 per cent of Quebec's 7m population.
However, polls suggest that around 27 per cent of voters are undecided.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Impact of interest rate changes 'weaker'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The ability of US policymakers to influence economic growth through changes
in short-term interest rates has probably been weakened by the growth of the
mortgage-backed bonds market, according to a study released by the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York.
The study, by three Fed economists, says that traders and investors in this
Dollars 1,350bn (Pounds 870bn) market helped transmit increases in
short-term rates, engineered by the Fed, into higher long-term bond yields.
Past rate-rises by the Fed have led to only small increases in long-term
rates, since they reduce the risk of inflation, one of the biggest factors
affecting the bond markets, according to the three.
The study appears to confirm anecdotal reports from bond traders in recent
months that a back-wash from the mortgage-backed bonds market helped to
drive down the price (and hence increase the yield) of US government bonds
this spring.
As US interest rates rise, pushing up the cost of new home mortgages,
homeowners have less incentive to pay off their old mortgages early. As a
result, the lives of the pools of home mortgages that support
mortgage-backed bonds is extended, stretching the duration of the bonds. To
counter this, traders and investors sell long-dated Treasuries, or
government bonds, to reduce the duration of their bond portfolios, in turn
driving down the price of Treasuries.
As evidence of this effect, the Fed economists point to a sharp decline in
the difference between 10-year and 30-year bond yields, from 60 basis points
(hundredths of a percentage point) in February to 20 basis points in early
May. This reflects the use of ten-year bonds to hedge changes in the
mortgage-backed market, they say.
The evidence of recent months suggests that 'the transmission of monetary
policy from short-term interest rates to the real economy, via long-term
interest rates, has probably changed,' the report concludes.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
New England moved a step closer to legalised gambling this week, with the
signing by Governor Bruce Sundlun of Rhode Island of a deal to allow the
Narragansett Indian tribe to build a Las Vegas-style casino in the state.
Last week, Governor William Weld of Massachusetts completed a similar
agreement with the Wampanoag tribe.
Gambling is currently illegal in every New England state except Connecticut.
Because the tribes are sovereign nations, they are not governed by the same
laws as US corporations. But companies might gain access to the states by
claiming unfair competition.
The Narragansetts will run the casino with Capital Gaming International, and
Rhode Island expects to earn about Dollars 53m (Pounds 34.1m) a year from
the casino. The Wampanoags intend to go into business with Carnival Hotels
and Casinos, with Massachusetts standing to receive about Dollars 105m
annually. The Narragansett and Wampanoag deals must now receive federal
approval before moving to a vote in the state legislatures.

FT  31 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Bidders queue up on Highway One -
Vietnam's road project is near the contract phase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Hanoi correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For about 75 international construction companies bidding for contracts on
Highway One, Vietnam's first large infrastructure project since 1975, the
nail-biting will not last much longer.
Officials from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB) say companies
should know by the end of this year whether they have clinched contracts to
upgrade the country's main road artery: a pot-holed, 2,300km two-lane road
that links Ho Chi Minh City with the capital, Hanoi.
Vietnamese transport officials suggest companies from South Korea and the US
are front-runners in a line-up including contractors from Malaysia, Japan,
India and Yugoslavia. The Chinese are also prominent on the list, reflecting
growing interest by Vietnam's giant neighbour in the country's
infrastructure projects.
The World Bank and ADB are part-financing the project through loans worth a
combined Dollars 278.5m. The total project is estimated at Dollars 317m. The
World Bank loan agreement has already been signed and ADB officials say the
ADB agreement should be signed within the next three weeks.
Both banks are inspecting pre-qualification documents and say they will
allow approved companies to make their bids later this month.
Interest has been keen. Most international companies have seen little
incentive in going for privately financed projects due to low traffic
volumes, which would limit the returns from tolls. However, with Vietnam's
renewed access to funds from multilateral agencies, following the clearing
of its IMF arrears, they have swooped in on Highway One.
South Korean companies, often regarded as the industry's most keenly priced
construction bidders, have submitted the most bids on both projects.
Together with the American bidders - which local press reports suggest
include big names such as Parsons Brinckerhoff and Brown and Root - they
appear to have a slight advantage, having had a hand in building roughly
3,000km of roads in the southern part of the country before 1975.
'I think they know the conditions in Vietnam better than the others because
of their experience before,' said Mr Pham Ngoc Thuy, general director of the
transport ministry's Project Management Unit 1, whose staff of 40 is
overseeing the bids from the Vietnamese side. The criteria used to determine
who gets the contracts are 'technical and financial capacity,' says Mr Thuy.
The portion of the Highway One upgrading overseen by the World Bank runs
from Hanoi to Vinh and is split into two sections, with one contract for
each. A third contract is for the section that runs south from the
industrial hub of Ho Chi Minh City to Can Tho. The ADB is overseeing the
stretch from Ho Chi Minh City to Nha Trang, further north.
In common with most multilaterally funded projects, price is likely to be
the determining factor. 'At the end of the day, the key is price,' said Mr
Bradley Babson, Hanoi Resident Representative of the World Bank. 'The whole
idea is to award the contract to the lowest technically qualified bid.'
Between 40 and 50 per cent of the bidders would get through to the next
stage of being invited to submit bids early next month, said Mr Thuy.
Work should start by May and was slated for completion in mid-1998, despite
the fact that some tax issues still had to be resolved, he said.
The government is still debating the tax regime for contractors awarded the
projects. They could be liable for import tax, personal income tax and
turnover tax, a widely unpopular special levy that applies to many foreign
investment projects in Vietnam.
'In the loan agreement with the (World) Bank, the bank has said it will not
finance any part of tax and the government must contribute this part, 100
per cent,' said Mr Thuy. 'Whether we apply the tax or not, it's a problem,'
he said.
However, contractors wishing to hire labour for the project would be able to
hire on the open market and there would be no special surcharges for hiring
workers, as there are in the oil industry.
Construction companies vying for Highway One projects are anxious to have
these issues ironed out before work starts, industry officials say.
Any cost overruns would be dealt with by holding over non-essential sections
of the highway until the next phase of World Bank and ADB-funded Highway One
projects. Both banks are conducting preliminary studies of stretches of the
road that do not fall within the current loan schemes, notably from Vinh to
Nha Trang.
Vietnam had not yet started resettling the millions of people affected and
was 'still surveying', said Mr Thuy. 'But it must be done before January.'
One of the components of the World Bank loan is assistance towards
relocation.
Highway One is the first of several infrastructure projects planned for the
country, whose 10,000km of roads have suffered from war damage and neglect.
The World Bank estimates that Vietnam will need Dollars 7bn-Dollars 10bn by
the year 2000 for comprehensive repairs to infrastructure and recommends
that at least Dollars 2.2bn be allocated to transport.

FT  31 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Markets freed to attract investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Market liberalisation to attract foreign investors is the most important
policy trend of the 1990s for international investment. But the greater
freedom this gives multinationals needs to be matched by the assumption of
greater social responsibilities, according to the World Investment Report.
The completion of the Uruguay Round of global talks, the North American Free
Trade Agreement and the single European market, not to mention increasing
numbers of bilateral investment treaties - 64 in 1993 - have reinforced
national policies of boosting foreign direct investment (FDI), the report
says.
However, while government approaches to FDI have converged, the process has
been far from homogenous. The report warns that as a result foreign
investors may focus on the differences in FDI regimes, increasing the scope
for 'policy competition' between governments.
Unctad identifies three main elements of liberalisation of FDI policies:
the tempering or removal of restrictions on foreign investors, for instance
relating to ownership or performance of foreign subsidiaries;
the establishment of standards for the treatment of foreign investors,
notably by according them 'national treatment' on a par with domestic
companies and by strengthening legal protection;
the introduction of regulations aimed at improving market efficiency and
promoting broader economic and social concerns. These include competition
rules, prudential supervision of banking and financial services,
intellectual property protection, consumer, health and environmental
standards and so on.
The report notes growing support for a system of international rules
governing the activities of multinationals. The OECD is now working on a new
multilateral investment agreement and there are also proposals to negotiate
international investment rules within the planned World Trade Organisation.

FT  31 AUG 94 / World Trade News: US companies sign up for Dollars 5bn of
new business in China - Sino-American relations enter fresh phase as bout of
commercial diplomacy pays off
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
American companies have initialled Dollars 5bn of agreements with Chinese
counterparts in the power, automotive, and communications sectors in the
last two days, signalling a more aggressive US drive into the China market.
Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, who is leading a trade mission to
China of the heads of some of America's biggest corporations, said yesterday
he had been 'exhilarated' by the success of US companies and the reception
he had received from Chinese officials.
He gave notice that the Americans would be fierce competitors for an
estimated Dollars 250bn worth of infrastructure projects in China before the
end of the century.
'American companies - often the world's technological leaders - deserve
their fair share,' he said.
'We intend to compete in this market, and we intend to win.'
Mr Brown described his mission to China as the beginning of a new era in
Sino-US commercial relations.
The high-profile US commercial diplomacy follows the Clinton
administration's decision in May to 'de-link' trade and human rights issues
in renewing China's Most Favoured Trading access to the United States.
The MFN issue had threatened to sour Sino-US relations. US corporations
argued that the administration's focus on human rights was jeopardising
American business interests in China and benefiting competitors in Europe
and Asia.
Mr Brown announced yesterday that China and the US would resume a dialogue
next month on human rights issues. Exchanges were broken off earlier this
year following the tense visit to Beijing of Mr Warren Christopher, the US
Secretary of State. Among Sino-US commercial agreements signed yesterday
were:
A Dollars 2bn agreement between the Wing Group and the Jiangsu Power Bureau
for the construction of China's first LNG (liquefied natural gas) fuelled
power plant, located in Jiangsu province, south-central China.
A Dollars 1bn agreement between Entergy Corporation of the US, in
partnership with the Lippo Group of Hong Kong, and the North China Power
Group for an extension to a power plant at Datong, Inner Mongolia. Supplies
of US-manufactured equipment would amount to Dollars 450m.
A contract between TRW of the US, Suman Group of Guangdong province and
Beijing Cable TV Network to supply 1m de-scrambler units for television
programmes in Chinese households.
An agreement between TRW and Jinan Auto-Accessories Works for the
manufacture of engine valves. The joint venture is expected to produce 14m
engine valves annually for China's fast-growing automotive sector.
An agreement between Sprint Communications and China's Ministry of Post and
Telecommunication for the introduction of Sprint's Internet service, opening
China to the international information super-highway.
These agreements followed others initialled on Monday, including a Dollars
150m contract involving Westinghouse for the supply of steam turbines and
other equipment for the Ligang power station on the Yangtze in Jiangsu
province.
Representatives of American power companies such as Entergy said that while
they were confident the projects would go ahead, difficult negotiations were
required on financing.
Among vexed issues is the rate of return to foreign companies taking equity
in power projects under 'build-operate-transfer' (BOT) arrangements.
China has baulked at returns exceeding 15 per cent, but company
representatives said the risks involved required higher rates.
Mr Brown told a packed meeting, organised by the US-China Business Council,
that US exports to China were growing at four times the rate of exports to
the rest of the world, and that 150,000 Americans earned their living from
these exports.
'China's importance - strategically and economically - demands that we
construct a more comprehensive relationship,' Mr Brown said.
The Brown mission was due to travel on to Shanghai last night, and then to
Guangzhou before ending up in Hong Kong.

FT  31 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Global business a fact of life - Unctad's
World Investment Report assesses role of multinationals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Governments and trade unions must accept the increasing globalisation of the
world economy as a fact of life - and they must devise new ways of
responding to the growing power of multinationals. This is the message of
the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) in its
fourth World Investment Report, published today.
But in a generally positive assessment of the role of multinationals in
employment, the report absolves them of claims by trade unions and some
governments that they rob rich countries of jobs in seeking to base
production wherever labour costs are lowest.
Multinationals employ directly about 73m people, representing nearly 10 per
cent of paid non-farm jobs worldwide and close to 20 per cent in the
industrialised countries.
Unctad estimates that indirect employment may be at least as much again.
This would bring the total number of jobs associated with multinationals to
150m or more.
The US sports shoe manufacturer Nike, for example, employs 9,000 people but
nearly 75,000 work for its independent sub-contractors around the globe.
Despite the huge increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) flows over the
past decade, employment in multinationals has not followed suit. The modest
8m increase in jobs since 1985 has been entirely concentrated in foreign
affiliates, which now employ 29m people. In developing countries
multinationals increased their workforce by 5m to 12m over the period.
Much of the employment increase in developing countries has been in east and
south-east Asia, especially China, and in export processing zones. Still,
'the job-relocation effect of FDI is very limited', Unctad maintains,
pointing out that the number of jobs lost to Third World nations is tiny
compared with the total labour force in the industrialised countries.
It adds that the bulk of FDI is determined not by labour cost differentials
(which may in any event be offset by productivity differences) but by the
search for natural resources and for markets.
Many of these markets, including those for services, require local
production.
Multinationals can in fact be a force making for higher labour standards in
poor countries, according to Unctad.
The workforce directly employed by foreign affiliates 'typically - but not
always - enjoys better wages, conditions of work and social security
benefits' compared with prevailing domestic levels.
Multinationals can also help workers, especially those in developing
countries, to acquire better skills to the benefit of the host economy as a
whole.
On the downside, Unctad acknowledges that competition between countries to
attract foreign investment may tempt governments to cut social and labour
standards - especially trade union rights - in the hope of securing extra
jobs.
But it says multinationals are increasingly looking for an educated, skilled
and committed workforce, combined with a social and physical infrastructure
capable of generating high productivity.
At the same time, the report displays misgivings that international
corporations are able to exercise growing economic influence largely
unchecked by governments or trade unions.
Though multinationals normally recognise unions and often appear to have a
higher rate of unionisation than domestic companies, trade unions are ill
equipped to deal with employers operating on a global basis and their
problems are exacerbated if governments see unions as a deterrent to foreign
investors.
Unctad notes the revived interest by unions in international regulations or
guidelines for multinationals, especially rules that would tie adoption of
minimum labour standards (including free trade unions) to trade. The
European works councils proposed by the European Union represent another
type of response.
However, the report says the need for companies constantly to 'reinvent'
themselves - which puts a rising premium on committed, flexible workforces -
paves the way for the development of 'new forms of co-operation' between
multinationals and trade unions, at workplace as well as international
level.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Australia puts faith in new PNG prime minister: Sir Julius
Chan faces a growing economic challenge as disillusionment grips
resource-rich nation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Julius Chan was sworn in as prime minister of Papua New Guinea, the
resource-rich nation adjoining Indonesia's Irian Jaya, after Mr Paias
Wingti, the previous incumbent, decided not to stand for re-election.
Sir Julius, 55, made his challenge for the country's top job on Monday,
saying a change of government was needed to ensure political security and
sound economic management.
Sir Julius, who heads the People's Progressive party, was the country's
first finance minister when it achieved independence in 1975, and was prime
minister between 1980 and 1982.
Although often at odds with Mr Wingti, he had been Papua New Guinea's deputy
prime minister before yesterday's events.
He first indicated that his PPP was breaking ranks with Mr Wingti's
governing coalition, and was teaming up with the opposition instead, on
Monday night.
Yesterday, he won the parliamentary vote by 69 votes to 32, with former
speaker Mr Bill Skate, standing as the alternative candidate. The Papua New
Guinea Supreme Court ordered the leadership ballot last week after declaring
Mr Wingti's election in 1993 invalid.
Mr Wingti had quietly resigned and then been re-elected as prime minister
the following morning. His aim was to get 18 months' immunity from a vote of
confidence, since the PNG constitution allows new prime ministers this
'grace period' before confidence motions can be tabled.
Sir Julius' election was greeted warmly in Australia, which has a
significant trading relationship with the country and provides about
ADollars 300m (Pounds 144m) in aid a year.
Relations with Mr Wingti were often strained, partly because Australia was
seeking to change the aid relationship, and fund specific projects rather
than provide 'untied' donations, and partly because of Mr Wingti's 'Look
North' policy, which emphasised Papua New Guinea's Asian links.
However, Sir Julius takes over at a time when the country's economic
problems are mounting; he has warned that the country, with a population of
about 4m, could face bankruptcy if remedial steps are not taken. Chronic
overspending by government departments is threatening the country's economic
viability.
The nation's budget deficit reached Kina 270m (Pounds 186m) in 1993, or 5.5
per cent of gross domestic product, from Kina 35.2m, or 1.2 per cent of GDP,
in 1989.
'The long trail of mismanagement and scandal has led us to the events of
today,' Sir Julius said yesterday.
Since independence, three prime ministers have been toppled by no-confidence
motions. Only four prime ministers have come to power through general
elections. 'There is disenchantment, not just with politicians, but possibly
with the whole system of government,' he said.
Immediately after being sworn in, Sir Julius said he would seek an end to
the secessionist struggle on Bougainville Island, which has been going on
since 1989.
His election could ensure political stability until the next poll, due in
1997. Resource analysts say he is likely to implement the long-delayed Lihir
gold project in his electorate of New Ireland. The project is seen as the
country's potential economic saviour.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Philippines steps up its privatisation drive: The Manila
Hotel leads a list of high-value assets on offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Philippines government has the big-ticket items on the block in its
privatisation drive. The Manila Hotel, the famous landmark by Manila Bay, is
now up for auction in a programme that has already raised more than 30bn
pesos (Pounds 735m) for the government.
The next assets to be privatised will be National Steel Corporation and
National Power Corporation (Napocor). However, these may yet take some time
because of disputes over who should shoulder their debt burdens and, in the
case of Napocor, the division of its assets. Government Service Insurance
System (GSIS), the state-administered employee retirement and benefits fund
that owns the hotel through its Manila Hotel Corporation (MHC), yesterday
announced a three-stage plan to privatise the prized asset.
The move, which follows closely the successful privatisation of oil-industry
leader Petron Corporation, involves:
sale of 20-30 per cent of MHC to a 'strategic partner' to be selected
through an open bidding in October,
a stock offering of 20 per cent of MHC to GSIS members and hotel employees
in December, and
a public offering of 5 to 15 per cent of MHC shares of stock in January
1995.
After completion of the programme, GSIS's holdings in MHC will have been
reduced to 45 per cent.
As in the Petron experience, the strategic partner will be relied upon to
provide wide expertise and financial support for the hotel's stability and
expansion.
While the privatisations are only partial, they will mean that both Petron
and MHC will no longer operate as state entities.
They follow the sale in 1991 of 30 per cent of the Philippine National Bank
and 67 per cent of Philippine Airlines in 1992.
The strategic partner 'will, under a management contract, provide MHC with a
global tie-up and expertise in operational capabilities in the hotel
business,' Mr Cesar Sarino, GSIS president, said at the weekend. Although
revenues have risen to some 600m pesos a year, the hotel's profits have
slowed by about 25 per cent each year since 1991.
The Manila Hotel divestment further bolsters the government's privatisation
programme. The Petron sale generated a total of 21.5bn pesos (making it the
largest privatisation effort in the country), of which 14.7bn pesos came
from the 40 per cent holdings won by Saudi Arabian Oil Company in a public
bidding.
Aside from giving it the most widely dispersed ownership base among
Philippine corporations, Petron's privatisation should be able to bolster
its resources in the increasingly competitive industry. As a
government-owned entity, Petron has had to contend with cumbersome
regulations that at times curtailed efforts at expansion.
For instance, in opening a new petrol station the company had to go through
circuitous public biddings and government audits required of state
enterprises.
This explains why, in spite of Petron's overall oil market leadership, it
has garnered the least share in the retail market. The procedural
bottlenecks often curtailed Petron's ability to react quickly to emerging
market trends.
'For Petron, its privatisation frees it from certain government regulations,
thus giving it the level playing field it needs to compete effectively,'
said Mr Monico Jacob, who has been retained as company president under the
new ownership set-up.
Petron has remained the industry leader for the past 17 years (its overall
market share last year was 45 per cent) owing to its edge in sales to the
industrial sector, including refining of crude petroleum for its rivals in
the local industry, and its dominance of the cooking gas market.
In 1993, Petron recorded total revenues of 44.94bn pesos, the most by any
Philippine business organisation. Its net profits of 2.78bn pesos for the
year were also the fifth largest among leading corporations.
Without a change in its production capacities, however, that leadership is
predicted to be eroded in the coming years as the Philippine economy grows.
Recent studies have indicated that a new oil refinery being put up by its
closest rival, Pilipinas Shell Petroleum, the subsidiary of the Anglo-Dutch
Shell group, will adversely affect Petron's profit performance once it goes
into full operation.
Pilipinas Shell has invested Dollars 700m (Pounds 450m) in a programme to
double its refinery capacity from its present 70,000 barrels of oil per day
(b/d). That will put its capacity closer to Petron's current 155,000 b/d.
The third oil company in the country, Caltex Philippines, also has plans to
double its 65,000 b/d refinery.
Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil exporter (shipments last year were
estimated at over Dollars 50bn), has not only pledged uninterrupted oil
supplies (Petron gets about 90 per cent of its crude oil requirements from
Middle East producers), it has also agreed to help make Petron an export
refiner in south-east Asia, an activity currently dominated by Singapore.
The Saudi investor is also expected to help Petron on its planned capital
expenditure programme over the next five years that will require investments
of some 12.18bn pesos. The bulk of these funds are intended for a hydro
refining project (costing 8.58bn pesos) to expand the company's production
of unleaded gasoline, and a gasoil desulphuriser facility (costing 703m
pesos) for production of environment-friendly low-sulphur diesel fuel.

   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China, reporting a sharp jump in the number of corruption cases this year,
said yesterday that rampant corruption threatened economic reform and vowed
again to crack down hard on graft, Reuter reports from Beijing.
A senior prosecutor said the number of corruption cases uncovered in the
first half of this year were 81 per cent up on the same 1993 period.
'Corruption is very serious and threatening reforms, liberalisation and
(the) socialist market economy,' Mr Liang Guoqing, deputy procurator-general
of the People's Supreme Procuratorate, told a news conference.
China's leaders fear public anger over corruption and inflation could upset
social stability, as it did in 1989 when many ordinary people backed
student-led pro-democracy demonstrations.

International mediators pressed India and Pakistan yesterday to renounce
their alleged atomic weapons programmes as Islamabad and New Delhi each
expelled one of the other's diplomats in a spying row, Reuter reports from
New Delhi.
A meeting in New Delhi of a US-led group of nations seeking to stem the
spread of missile technology urged India to halt its alleged nuclear warfare
project. Senior officials from the US, Britain, Switzerland and Australia
told the Indian government New Delhi's alleged programme had increased
regional tensions.
They sought New Delhi's support for the Missile Technology Control Regime
(MTCR), which tries to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. It was the
first visit by a MTCR team to New Delhi, which has long spurned
international pressure to renounce nuclear arms. Some of the MTCR officials
later left for Pakistan, India's old enemy, to deliver the same message.
Former Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif said last week that Islamabad
already had the atomic bomb.

Sudan yesterday became the second Moslem country in two days to boycott next
week's International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo. The
move follows an attack last week on the conference's programme by President
Omar Hassan al-Bashir, Sudan's leader, who said it contradicted moral and
religious values, Mark Nicholson writes from Cairo.
Sudan's decision not to send a delegation comes a day after that by Saudi
Arabia. Saudi officials have so far failed to specify why they will not
participate. However, Sudanese officials were quoted yesterday by state
media as calling for a generalised boycott of the meeting, which they
accused of being a western ploy to curb population growth in the Moslem
world.
Egyptian Islamic opponents of the conference, however, yesterday failed in
an attempt to have it barred from taking place in Cairo as an Egyptian court
threw out an attempt by three prominent Islamist lawyers to ban the meeting.
Meanwhile, Mrs Tancu Ciller, Turkish prime minister, yesterday said she
would not attend the event. An official statement said she would be too busy
preparing for the early September opening of parliament to attend. The prime
minister of Bangladesh, Mrs Begum Khaleda Zia, has already said she was too
'pressed' at home to attend the meeting.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa released worse than expected inflation figures yesterday,
pushing bond yields past the the psychological barrier of 17 per cent, and
putting heavy pressure on the government's ability to keep its annual
deficit at a budgeted level of 6.4 per cent, Mark Suzman reports from
Johannesburg.
The Consumer Price Index for July rose at an annualised rate of 8.2 per
cent, up from 7.5 per cent in June and a full percentage point above the
21-year low reached in April of 7.1 per cent. In response, rates on the
government's benchmark R150 bond rose to 17.05 per cent yesterday morning
before dropping back to finish the day at 16.76 per cent.
Bond yields, which hit a low of 11.6 per cent in January, have been rising
steadily since the April elections and have soared over the past few weeks,
fuelled largely by fears of higher inflation and a lack of faith in
government promises of fiscal restraint. Economists estimate that the recent
rise in the bond market could add between R1bn and R1.5bn (Pounds
181m-Pounds 272m) to the government's interest bill, which already accounts
for some 17 per cent of the total budget.
Also contributing to the bear market is continuing uncertainty over the
future of South Africa's two-tier currency. Government and monetary
officials are publicly committed to scrapping the financial rand investment
currency, a move that will almost certainly send short term interest rates
rocketing, but have given no timetable for the move. As a result, the
currency and bond markets are prey to continued activity by speculators
trying to second guess the financial authorities.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Coalition split on tax reform: Foreign policy divisions
emerge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A public split over foreign policy and tax reform has ended the two-month
honeymoon enjoyed by partners in Japan's new coalition government.
Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Socialist prime minister of a three-party coalition
dominated by the conservative Liberal Democratic party, exhibited splits
with his LDP partners during a four-country tour of south-east Asia, ending
yesterday.
Speaking in Singapore, the pacifist Mr Murayama reversed the previous
government's unprecedentedly explicit bid for a permanent seat on the UN
Security Council. He called for caution on the move, a mark of his own deep
pacifism.
Mr Murayama was immediatedly contradicted by Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, LDP
minister for international trade and industry, seen by a growing number of
government officials as a likely next prime minister. Japan would 'suffer a
loss' if it failed to become a permanent council member, Mr Hashimoto said.
Some senior LDP members, including Mr Yohei Kono, foreign minister, share Mr
Murayama's caution. Yet the UN debate goes to the heart of an unresolved
rift in the ruling classes over whether Japan should seek diplomatic
influence and responsibility commensurate with its economic weight, or be
content with a discreet international profile.
Separately, Mr Murayama reopened a long-running controversy over the
weakening state of Japan's government finances by saying that he did not
necessarily want to deliver planned cuts in income tax and increases in
sales tax in a single package.
This drew a quick, though polite, response from Mr Masayoshi Takemura,
finance minister and head of the New Harbinger party, the junior coalition
partner. He stressed that it would be 'desirable' to link an income tax cut
and a consumption tax increase in a 'concrete' tax reform to be decided by
the end of September, for enactment by the end of the year.
Mr Takemura is sensitive to his own ministry's fear that the government
faces a sharp rise in its general deficit, now at 1.9 per cent of gross
domestic product, if it fails to increase indirect taxes. This is needed to
compensate for an expected shrinkage in the income tax base caused by a
steep decline in the number of wage earners and a rise in pensioners
expected over the next 20 years.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Oman 'investigating motives' of 200 dissidents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN ALLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Authorities in Oman are investigating the motives of more than 200
dissidents, detained on sedition charges, having acknowledged the arrest of
members of a 'secret organisation using the Islamic faith as a mask for
arousing sedition and splitting national unity for which the Omani Moslem
society is blessed'.
Many detainees have been released; the rest will be tried.
The government's six-week delay before announcing the arrests reflects its
sensitivity over the existence of any dissension in a country remarkable for
its cohesion and stability in the 24 years since Sultan Qaboos came to
power.
Among those detained were four employees of Petroleum Development Oman
(PDO), whose oil and gas exports provide nearly 80 per cent of annual state
income; and two under-secretaries in the agriculture and commerce
ministries.
Since the beginning of this year, diplomats and businessmen in Muscat have
commented on the rise of Islamic activism, particularly among Oman's youth
who have drawn their inspiration, but not necessarily money, from a variety
of sources including radical Islamic groups in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran,
Saudi Arabia and Egypt.
Diplomats and businessmen have suggested dissent may be related to the
lifestyle of the elite and a rising number of unemployed school-leavers and
university graduates.
The economy this year has suffered from low oil prices and the weakness of
the dollar in which oil payments are denominated, combined with a strong
yen, 10 per cent budget cuts and spending which is heavily imbalanced in
favour of current spending on defence and civil ministries.
For example, the government share in PDO capital expenditure last year was
only 7.5 per cent of total spending, and the same ratio exists this year,
whereas capital equipment now on order for the armed forces is twice that
proportion.
Oman's privatisation programme and its attempt to attract private foreign
investors is still in its infancy. Some Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn)-Dollars
5bn is conservatively reckoned to be held abroad. But this money will not
return until more investment opportunities are created.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Japan's jobless at seven-year peak of 3%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese unemployment rose to a seven-year high of 3 per cent in July -
nearly 1.9m people - casting a shadow over an already weak economic
recovery.
The second monthly increase in a row, from 2.9 per cent in June, increases
the chances the jobless rate will break through its 1987 record of 3.1 per
cent. The job situation will remain 'severe' even if the general economy
picks up, warned Mr Kozo Igarashi, chief cabinet secretary.
This increases the pressure on the coalition government, led by Mr Tomiichi
Murayama, a Socialist, whose chances of lifting its low popularity depend on
delivering an economic recovery.
Japanese unemployment remains low by comparison with 6.1 per cent in the US,
yet any rise provokes a fresh round of public agonising over Japan's ability
to uphold the hallowed tradition of job stability. Corporate Japan's drive
to cut costs, by shifting production to cheaper locations in south-east Asia
and cutting domestic recruitment, are the main features of the increase in
jobless.
Tokyo economists do not believe the unemployment rate will significantly
surpass 3 per cent, yet this latest rise is enough to worry the government.
Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, minister of international trade and industry,
yesterday called for the creation of more temporary posts, helped by fewer
official restrictions on personnel agencies. Mr Manso Hamamoto, labour
minister, promised to boost efforts to help the jobless back to work.
The number out of work rose sharply, by 18.2 per cent over the year to July,
to 1.88m. Of those in work, the number of salaried employees fell by 20,000,
for the first time in 16 years, a mark of corporate cost cuts.
At the same time, the overall labour market has weakened, the main reason
for the government's gloom over the outlook. There were only 62 jobs
available for every 100 people seeking work in July, the third consecutive
monthly decline.
This confirms the poor job outlook for the latest batch of university
graduates, which accounts for most job seekers. The job seekers' ratio
stands at the lowest since January 1987, when the economy was reeling, as
now, from a rise in the yen. A further decline in the ratio is expected, Mr
Dick Beason, senior economist at James Capel Pacific, says.

Mr Myung Wung Chung, the Korean conductor who is fighting his dismissal as
artistic director of Opera de Paris, yesterday was physically barred from
entering the Bastille opera house by Mr Jean-Paul Cluzel, the director.
Opera de Paris fired Mr Chung two weeks ago after fruitless negotiations
over his contract. However, Mr Chung won an important battle in his legal
campaign against his dismissal on Monday when a Paris judge ruled that he
should be reinstated until his case had been heard. The judge also ruled
that Opera de Paris would not be allowed to appoint other conductors for
productions originally to be directed by Mr Chung. The Opera de Paris
management refused to reinstate Mr Chung and to admit him when he arrived at
the Bastille yesterday for a rehearsal of Verdi's Simon Boccanegra, which is
due to open the Bastille's autumn season on September 19. Members of the
orchestra said they would strike in protest if Simon Boccanegra went ahead
without Mr Chung.

Turkish police arrested four men yesterday in connection with the shooting

Nadir's collapsed Polly Peck conglomerate. Istanbul police held two men
suspected of the shooting of Mr David Adams on August 19 in Istanbul, and
arrested two more for ordering the shooting. Police caught a 21-year-old
youth taking part in another Istanbul shooting on August 25 and tracked down
the others after questioning him. Mr Adams, a Briton, is a Coopers
management consultant but has no link to the Polly Peck case. Coopers said
they believed the real target was Mr Christopher Howell, a partner in the
firm and the executive in charge of the Polly Peck case. Mr Howell was
beaten up by two Turks on June 7, the night before a Turkish court addressed
criminal charges against the Polly Peck administrators resulting from
complaints made by Mr Nadir.

smarting at legal moves by the European Union to block the import of
Turkish-Cypriot produce, and EU support for the Greek-Cypriot application to
join the Union, the parliament of the self-declared Turkish-Cypriot republic
passed a motion on Monday to co-ordinate foreign, defence and security
policy with Ankara, in effect endorsing the fact of partition and supporting
the aspiration of formal integration with Turkey. Turkish officials describe
the motion as similar to existing security arrangements between Athens and

The German economy is clearly growing faster than could have been expected
at the beginning of the year, but there are grounds for concern, said Mr
Tyll Necker, head of the Federation of German Industry. Mr Necker said he
agreed in the main with the forecast published on Monday by the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development, which said it expected the German
economy to grow 1.8 per cent in 1994. He said he saw a pattern common to
German recoveries, with exports picking up first, then capital goods, and
lastly a recovery in employment and consumer spending. The economics
minister, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, this month raised the government's forecast of
1994 growth from 2.0 to 2.5 per cent. But Mr Necker said increases in taxes
and other administrative costs expected in 1995 could pose additional
economic burdens that could choke off the recovery.

FT  31 AUG 94 / French bank base rates rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France's leading commercial banks yesterday reversed the downward trend in
interest rates by announcing the first increase in bank base rates since
December 1992. Credit Commercial de France led the field by raising its base
rate to 7.95 per cent from 7.7 per cent. Other big banks then followed suit,
including Banque Nationale de Paris, Credit Lyonnais and Societe Generale.
Analysts interpreted the increase as an attempt to offset the pressure on
the banks' profitability, which has been depressed by the continuing
problems of the property market, by recent rises in money market rates and
by the banks' poor performances in the bond and equity markets.
'What we're seeing is an attempt by the banks to protect their margins,'
said Mr Christopher Potts, chief French economist at Banque Indosuez in
Paris. 'They'd have probably liked to have raised base rates sooner, but
waited to see if there would be a recovery in bonds. There hasn't been.' The
increase in base rates flies in the face of the Balladur government's
economic policy and of the stable interest rate stance adopted by the newly
independent Bank of France. Paribas said that it did not expect yesterday's
move to affect the central bank's future strategy. However, there was
concern among observers about the impact of the increase on the cost of
credit and hence on the prospects for France's still fragile economic
recovery. 'It is unusual for banks to raise the cost of credit so early in
an upswing,' said Mr Potts. 'The critical question is whether this is the
beginning of a trend.'

Russian troops slipped quietly across the Estonian and Latvian borders
yesterday ending 50 years of Soviet military presence in the Baltic states
but leaving behind a legacy of environmental damage, an unsolved border
dispute and intense domestic criticism in Estonia about the retired Russian
officers who will remain in the Baltics.
At the deserted Soviet naval base in the centre of Tallinn yesterday
morning, a Soviet army jacket and cap were slung over a chair where before a
guard would have stood. Only a few parked Ladas and a military jeep stacked
high with tables, chairs and household objects gave any indication of the
remaining 20 men still to leave the base.
With farewell posters reading 'Bye' in Russian pinned up throughout Estonia,
some of the returning officers professed sadness before today's formal
handover of all but two of its bases to the Baltic states.
'I'm sorry to leave here - I had a good flat and life was good. Of course I
don't want to go,' said a 35-year-old marine officer as he piled the last of
his possessions on to a vehicle. 'It's not clear where I will live in
Russia, I have no flat there and I don't know what I will be doing.'
Many of the returning men feel disgruntled by the orders from the Russian
defence ministry forbidding any leaving ceremony, and a couple of hundred at
the naval base in Tallinn are refusing to leave, saying they have nowhere to
go. Some have spent their entire working lives in the Baltics.
At the height of the Soviet empire about 350,000 Soviet troops were
stationed at over 1,000 military bases in the three Baltic states - Estonia,
Latvia and Lithuania - enjoying a high standard of living, good apartments
and privileges. Now, Russia will officially leave only 210 military men
behind to dismantle the nuclear submarine base at Paldiski in Estonia and
about 300 will continue work at Latvia's radar installation at Skrunda until
the end of the century.
However, on the eve of the Soviet withdrawal yesterday, there was no
jubilation among Baltic officials. A Soviet ship was still in Paldiski
harbour, a train carrying soldiers and their equipment was waiting for
permission to enter Russia from southern Estonia and the foreign ministries
in the Baltics had little idea of exactly how many troops remained in each
country. 'It is too early to celebrate', said an Estonian foreign ministry
official.
There has been a gradual withdrawal from the region since March, and by July
there were only 2,400 soldiers still on Estonian soil, but some local people
fear that many officers are simply taking off their uniforms and
disappearing into the civilian population.
Negotiation over troop withdrawals has been the main topic of debate in the
Baltic states since they declared independence in 1991. The pullout
agreement was hailed by Mr Mart Laar, Estonian prime minister, as the
'ending of the second world war on Estonian soil'. He confessed to having
saved a bottle of whisky for the event, while President Lennart Meri said he
would toast the last troop to leave with champagne. Church bells will ring
simultaneously in Estonia and Latvia on September 1 to mark the first day of
complete independence, but official celebrations have been cancelled on the
grounds that too many problems would be left behind.
Troops left Lithuania last year, but Russian relations with Estonia and
Latvia proved more difficult after Moscow's insistence on social rights for
its military pensioners in Estonia. In addition, Russia's wish to retain a
military presence at Skrunda proved unacceptable. Compromise agreements
signed with the three Baltic states provoked a storm of domestic criticism.
The opposition in Latvia termed the decision to allow Russians to remain at
Skrunda a 'sell out' to western pressure. On the Russian side, President
Boris Yeltsin recently said Latvia was discriminating against Russian
citizens in its citizenship law.
In Estonia, the main sticking point is whether 10,000 retired Russian
military personnel will be granted residency. Officials argue that many of
the so-called retired officers are still in active service. 'Russia keeps
them as a dissenting fifth column,' said academic and opposition MP Endel
Lippmaa. 'These are not pensioners.'
Tension has increased in the past few weeks as Russia has started marking
the disputed border between the two countries taking territory which Estonia
claims as its own under the 1920 Tartu Treaty.
Not least in the trail of complaints is the environmental damage caused by
Soviet occupation, for which the Russian Federation refuses to take
responsibility. The airbase at Tukums, Latvia, for example is polluted with
jet fuel, while Estonia estimates that Dollars 4bn is needed to clean up its
bases.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Sardinian leads challenge to Polish TV law: A look at a
media showdown in Warsaw
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Poland's broadcast media legislation passed last year is being put to the
test this week as the authorities move against unlicensed television
stations amid continuing controversy over the licences that have been
granted.
On Monday the police burst in on six local stations controlled by Mr Nicola
Grauso, a silver-haired Sardinian media owner, and closed them down just as
they were broadcasting MacGyver, an American series depicting a secret agent
whose ingenuity in escaping from seemingly hopeless situations often defies
belief.
Angry viewers called into the stations to ask what was happening when their
screens went blank. The MacGyver series, along with a diet of popular films
and soap operas, has helped Polonia 1, the Grauso network in Poland, build
an urban audience of between 20 and 30 per cent.
'We have 8m viewers - the biggest audience for a single commercial station
in Europe,' Mr Grauso claimed yesterday, perhaps hyperbolically, as he
complained about his predicament. 'I came to Poland five years ago
encouraged by the statements of the government intent on attracting
investors,' he added, saying he had spent Dollars 50m in the country to
date.
The authorities replied that they were merely implementing the law when they
sent in the police.
They explained that Mr Grauso's bid for a licence had failed because more
than 33 per cent of the equity in the Polonia network, the upper limit under
Poland's broadcast law, was in foreign hands.
But there's no denying his success in building a network with a significant
audience. He is said to have the support of President Lech Walesa, who is
looking for allies in the media to smooth his way to a second term in
presidential elections late next year. The Polonia regional stations closed
are those in Warsaw, Krakow, Lublin, Szczecin, Poznan and Opole. Police said
six other stations owned by Mr Grauso would be taken off the air soon.
Mr Grauso said he would apply for temporary permits for his network to
operate until a new round of licence allocations starts in two months' time.
He added that he was discussing with Polish businessmen the possibility of
selling some of his shares in Polonia.
For the moment, the financial rewards are small, as the TV advertising
market last year was estimated at around Dollars 170m, of which the lion's
share went to state-owned TV. This sum will soon have to be distributed
among the two regional networks and the 13 local stations, which are due to
have their licences granted soon, in addition to state TV's two channels and
PolSat, the Polish-owned company which has been granted the country's only
national commercial licence.
But with the Polish economy set to grow by around 5 per cent a year, the
prospect of future rewards has been significant enough to tempt large
companies such as Bertelsmann of Germany and Time-Warner of the US into
making, thus far, unsuccessful applications and to prompt Mr Rupert Murdoch
to plan satellite broadcasts into the country of five channels, including
Filmnet.
So far PolSat, whose national licence is still being tested in the courts by
the other groups which lost out in the first round of the licensing contest,
has failed to build an audience bigger than 7 per cent.
The station, which is well regarded by the former communist nomenklatura as
well as the Catholic church, which maintains its religious department, is
opposed by President Walesa.
Mr Walesa recently appointed Mr Janusz Zaorski, a former head of state radio
and TV, to head the TV and Radio Council, the independent licensing body.
Now Mr Walesa is looking to his nominee to do something about the PolSat
licence.
So far, out of the western hopefuls, only Canal Plus, the French pay-TV
channel, has been granted a regional licence and it hopes to get a pay
service on the air in four cities by Christmas. Kinnevik AB from Sweden is
involved with Wisla TV, a Polish broadcaster licensed to operate in southern
Poland.
Meanwhile, the lobbying will continue and the financial and political stakes
are high, especially with a presidential campaign due next year.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Renault sale waits on Volvo: Government to remain majority
shareholder, says Balladur
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government will press ahead with the partial privatisation of the
Renault motor group as soon as Volvo agrees, Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime
minister, said yesterday. The Swedish car-maker owns 20 per cent of Renault.
Full-scale negotiations with Volvo will begin as soon as the French
authorities have completed a valuation of Renault, which is estimated to be
worth around FFr40bn (Pounds 4.8bn). Mr Balladur, speaking on French radio,
sketched a scenario in which Volvo would sell all or part of its 20 per cent
holding at the same time as the government sold a portion of its 80 per cent
stake.
However, he stressed that the state would remain the majority shareholder'
of Renault 'at least for the present', thereby quashing speculation that it
might be tempted to reduce its holding to a blocking minority of 38 per
cent. 'Have you ever heard me say that I intended to privatise 100 per cent,
or even 60 per cent, of Renault? Never, never,' he said.
Mr Balladur emphasised that he saw the partial privatisation and the
reduction of Volvo's stake as a precursor of the formation of new
international alliances for Renault within the motor industry. Renault and
Volvo were originally intended to forge such an alliance until the Swedish
company's shareholders torpedoed the scheme last December.
The two groups have since been searching for ways of unravelling their
cross-shareholding agreement. Volvo is reported to be willing to reduce its
20 per cent stake to 8 per cent, in return for the French company's 45 per
cent holding in its truck business.
Analysts yesterday speculated that the French government may be aiming to
complete Renault's partial privatisation before the end of November, when
the present 'divorce' agreement with Volvo is due to expire.
Meanwhile, Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the French insurance group
which is another contender for privatisation, will today publish its results
for the first half of 1994.
AGF was originally expected to unveil its interim figures later in the
autumn, but is believed by analysts to have accelerated the announcement in
the hope of enhancing its privatisation prospects. It is expected to
announce a fall in net profits to between FFr1bn and FFr1.2bn from FFr1.4bn
in the first half last year.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Economic Watch: Surge in Italian trade surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's overall trade surplus for the first six months of 1994 could be
nearly double the surplus in the first half of 1993, according to estimates
published yesterday by the Italian Exchange Office. Taking into account flow
of funds through the banking sector, and provisional data on debit and
credit transactions, the Exchange Office estimated the trade surplus in the
first six months at L16,000bn (Pounds 6.62bn). For the first half of 1993,
official figures showed a surplus of L8,611bn. Excluding credit and debit
transactions, Italy recorded an overall surplus in the first six months of
1994 of L4,607bn. That compared with a deficit of L2,071bn in the equivalent
period last year. In June, the surplus was L2,217bn against L776bn in May,
and L616bn in June 1993. The figures showed that payments for goods reached
L19,242bn in June, an increase of 5.3 per cent on June 1993, while receipts
rose by 13.6 per cent to L21,459bn.
Consumers in the Netherlands borrowed 5.8 per cent more in the first half of
1994 than in the same period a year earlier. The Central Bureau for
Statistics said consumers borrowed Fl 6.3bn (Pounds 2.3bn) in the latest
January-June reporting period. Purchases of cars and video equipment were
prominent among the purposes of the borrowing, the agency added.
The Dutch index of manufacturing orders in hand rose to 103.7 in July from
103.5 in June, the Central Bureau of Statistics said. Orders to eastern
German manufacturers rose 19.6 per cent in June from May and were up 15.3
per cent from June 1993, Germany's Economics Ministry reported yesterday.

Italian cabinet ministers met yesterday to discuss cutting pension spending
but delayed any decision on an amnesty for disability fraud. Implementing
savings on pensions is a key part of prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's plan
to cut the budget deficit. The government suspects that as many as 3m people
in a country of 57m receive some monthly payments for disabilities they do
not have. Cabinet secretary Gianni Letta said the ministers agreed to
overhaul the entire disability system. But he told reporters that an amnesty
for disability fraudsters, which had been proposed by some coalition
partners, had not yet been taken up for discussion.

FT  31 AUG 94 / German state eases grip on the mails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's state postal monopoly was weakened further yesterday by an
agreement to let private companies deliver shopping catalogues, magazines
and advertising material. Mail order company costs - and the volume of
domestic letter post handled by the federal service - could eventually be
reduced by up to 30 per cent.
The first licences will be distributed before the end of the year among the
67 private companies which have already applied, said the economics
ministry.
The move is a compromise in a tussle between the economics and postal
ministries, and was reached yesterday following the intervention of Mr
Friedrich Bohl, senior minister in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's office. Under
the deal, private mass-mailings of 1,000 or more items weighing more than
250g will be allowed from next January. One year later the weight limit will
be lowered to 100g.
The BVH mail order industry association said it was disappointed by the 250g
restriction, claiming only a third of its annual mailings could go through
private distribution channels for the first year. It also wanted legally
binding assurances that the limit would be lowered to 100g on time.
However, the compromise marks a successful end to the BVH lobbying. Mail
order companies, which have already registered a joint-venture private
postal company, AZD, will be the earliest beneficiaries.
During their three-year campaign they claimed complete liberalisation would
help reduce their annual postage bill of DM1bn (Pounds 417m) by 20-30 per
cent. They also countered warnings that 30,000 federal postal service jobs
were at risk with claims that the private delivery system would generate
25,000 places.
The state Infopost service, which currently has a monopoly on mass-mailings,
last year contributed around DM4.5bn to the state post office's total
turnover of DM28bn.
The reform is one of the most important liberalisation measures yet in the
postal system, and follows the post office's recent award of a contract to
the TNT transport multinational to manage a network of 33 new parcel post
freight centres under construction at a cost of DM4bn.
Despite having facing private competition in parcel deliveries for almost 20
years, the state service still has a 26 per cent share of the domestic
market.
Other moves under way include the replacement of 500 single-counter official
post offices with licensed agencies in private shops and petrol stations.
Efforts to counter the erosion of the workforce include a project to offer
companies a comprehensive mail delivery service in which post will be
delivered to individual offices.
The shake-out precedes the first stage of privatisation of the postal
service, scheduled for 1998, under which the government will offer for sale
25 per cent of its shares in Deutsche Post, a new joint-stock company
embracing all activities of the state concern, which will be established
next year.

<TEXT>
There could scarcely have been a greater contrast in Russia's reaction to
the withdrawal of troops from Germany and the Baltic states, writes John
Thornhill in Moscow. The morning newspapers congratulated the Russian army
in Germany on a job well done. Rossiskaya Gazeta said the army had been a
factor for stability in Europe and had 'sincerely fulfilled its historic
mission in support of peace on the continent'.
The troop withdrawal from Germany - Russian soldiers are pictured (right)
marching past the Soviet war memorial yesterday in Berlin - was the lead
item on the evening news of the main television channel. Reporters stressed
the army's role in crushing fascism, screening pictures of swarming Russian
troops and exploding swastikas.
The army newspaper, Krasnaya Zvezda, struck a note of caution saying the
balance of power between Russia and Germany was vital for Europe's
stability.
The withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic states merited just the
briefest mention on television news. A sober article in Izvestiya commented
it was easier for Russian troops to leave Berlin than the Baltic republics
because they had not been there so long nor felt the country was their own.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Rowland under threat over Pounds 5.5m costs claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tiny Rowland will this week be fighting to survive as joint chief
executive of Lonrho - the international trading company he has run for 33
years - after the disclosure that he costs the company more than Pounds 5.5m
a year in salary, expenses and other charges under his direct control.
They include a contribution of about Pounds 500,000 to the costs of his
Belgravia home and a mansion at Hedsor Wharf, near Cliveden in
Buckinghamshire; more than Pounds 1m in business expenses; and Pounds
200,000 to pay for the education of dependants of African politicians and
business contacts.
Directors said yesterday that they were so shocked at the magnitude of what
Mr Rowland cost the company that they may vote to strip him of his executive
duties at a board meeting tomorrow.
For the past year, Mr Rowland has been at loggerheads with Mr Dieter Bock,
his fellow chief executive, who acquired an 18.8 per cent stake in Lonrho at
the beginning of 1993. He believes Mr Rowland has been frustrating his
attempts to reorganise Lonrho's assets.
At the board meeting, Mr Rowland will also face criticism about his sale for
Pounds 200,000 of a film financed by Lonrho about the Lockerbie bombing to
an Egyptian company, the Joint Arab International Investment Company
(Jaico), connected to the Libyan Arab Finance Company (Lafico).
Directors are concerned that the sale may have breached United Nations
restrictions on the sale of investments to Libya.
Documentary evidence of a connection between Jaico and Lafico is that Mr
Mohamed El Huwej, the chairman of Lafico, signed the sale contract on behalf
of Jaico. Under UN sanctions, companies are required to seek permission from
the Bank of England before 'parting with . . . investments to . . . a Libyan
person'. It is understood that the Bank's permission was not sought in this
case.
Last night, one Lonrho director described the cost of Mr Rowland to the
company as 'outrageous'.
According to a Financial Times analysis, the Pounds 5.5m costs include:
Mr Rowland's salary of more than Pounds 1.2m;
Lonrho's Gulfstream private jet, used almost exclusively by Mr Rowland:
about Pounds 2m a year;
More than Pounds 300,000 for staff working directly for Mr Rowland.
A 51 per cent majority of the 13 Lonrho board members would be required to
strip Mr Rowland of his executive status. To remove the 76-year-old Mr
Rowland from the board altogether, a 75 per cent majority would be required.
It is believed that Mr Rowland can count on the support of only two
directors, Mr Rene Leclezio, who retires at the end of October, and Mr
Robert Dunlop, who retires at the end of September.
More than 20 years ago, Mr Rowland survived a similar attempt to oust him by
the so-called Straight-Eight directors, led by Sir Basil Smallpeice.
Mr Bock has been trying to persuade mainstream investment institutions to
buy Lonrho shares to gradually replace small investors who until recently
have for decades been loyal to Mr Rowland.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Dollars 10bn US defence merger: Lockheed and Martin Marietta
deal prompted by need to reduce high costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The world defence industry saw its biggest consolidation yesterday when
Lockheed and Martin Marietta, two of the top three US defence contractors,
unveiled plans for a Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.4bn) merger.
The new company, to be called Lockheed Martin, will oust McDonnell Douglas
as the world's biggest defence contractor. On the basis of Lockheed and
Martin Marietta's combined sales of Dollars 22.5bn last year, Lockheed
Martin will be the 16th largest company in the US. The companies have assets
of Dollars 17.8bn and presently employ 170,000 people.
Cost-cutting in an extremely tough defence market is the main reason behind
the merger. Mr Norman Augustine, chairman of Martin Marietta, told a press
conference in New York: 'The arithmetic is simple. Three full factories are
better than six half-full factories.'
Approximately 60 per cent of the merged company's business will be military,
with a further 9 per cent coming from the US space agency or civil
government contracts.
Job cuts are likely to be heaviest in central and administrative functions
such as headquarters staff, property, information services and treasury. The
two companies have largely complementary industrial operations, with
Lockheed specialising in aircraft manufacture and Martin Marietta in
electronics. Only in the space and missiles operations is there a
significant overlap.
Under the terms of the deal Lockheed shareholders will receive 1.63 Lockheed
Martin shares for each Lockheed share, and Martin Marietta shareholders will
receive the new company's shares in a one-for-one swap. The new company
intends to pay a dividend of Dollars 1.40 a share, equal to that presently
paid by Lockheed.
The all-share deal was initiated by Mr Daniel Tellep, chairman and chief
executive of Lockheed, about five months ago. Negotiations were concluded in
New York late on Monday night. Mr Tellep will become chairman of the merged
company, with Mr Augustine becoming president. Mr Augustine is expected to
succeed Mr Tellep on his retirement.
On Wall Street, Lockheed soared Dollars 10 3/4 to Dollars 76 3/4 while
Martin Marietta finished up Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 48 3/4 , as news of the
merger helped lift the Dow to its highest close since February 17.
Among other defence stocks, Loral Corp rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 41 1/8 ,
E-Systems - widely considered as a possible candidate for acquisition -
jumped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 42 1/2 and Northrop Grumman advanced Dollars
1 3/8 to Dollars 44 after the Lockheed-Martin Marietta deal sparked
speculation of further mergers among US defence contractors.
Although the US defence industry has shrunk significantly since the end of
the cold war, its rate of contraction has failed to keep up with the
reduction in defence spending.
Mr Augustine said: 'The fact is that the defence budget has been cut, is
being cut, and there are simply too many companies in our industry to
prosper or for our customers to afford.' Both companies have participated in
earlier consolidations: Lockheed recently bought General Dynamics' F-16
fighter aircraft business, while Martin Marietta bought General Electric's
aerospace business and General Dynamics' space systems division. But Mr
Tellep said acquisition prices had gone too high.
The deal is subject to federal anti-trust clearance, but both companies are
optimistic of winning approval because the defence department has been
pressing the industry to consolidate more rapidly.
'The bottom line is the national defence budget simply cannot afford all the
inefficiencies that go with an industry in such a condition,' Mr Augustine
said. The Pentagon said yesterday that while it viewed consolidation in the
defence industry as inevitable, the merger would be reviewed by defence
officials in conjunction with the department of justice and the federal
trade commission.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Reynolds declares Ulster is poised for peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, declared last night that
Northern Ireland was 'poised for peace' as the province prepared for an IRA
ceasefire that might signal the end of its 25-year campaign against the
presence of British troops.
With expectations mounting of an imminent - and possibly historic - IRA
announcement, Mr Reynolds said people would be able to make 'an entirely new
beginning on this island' in 'a very short time'.
'A complete cessation of violence' - as demanded by the British and Irish
governments - 'and the principles of the Downing Street declaration are our
new starting point', Mr Reynolds said after a meeting of the Irish cabinet.
He later had his second telephone conversation in just over 24 hours with Mr
John Major, the UK prime minister. Downing Street said it was 'a matter of
keeping in touch'.
Mr Reynolds's comments came as the British government moved to counter
Unionist suspicions that it had offered secret concessions to republican
leaders to secure a ceasefire. Downing Street said no concessions had been
made to anyone.
In the US White House officials were said to be 'at fever pitch' over the
improving prospects of peace. The Clinton administration is understood to be
preparing to offer a large increase in financial aid to Ulster.
The US already gives Dollars 20m (Pounds 12.9m) a year to the International
Fund for Ireland, which is jointly administered by the UK and the Irish
Republic.
A permanent cessation of IRA violence would open the way for exploratory
talks between Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, and the British
government within three months. The talks would explore the basis for Sinn
Fein's admittance into talks on the province's future and examine the
practical consequences of the ending of violence.
Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and
Labour party, last night called for talks with Sinn Fein to begin 'a lot
sooner than three months'.
Yesterday's developments followed the first public acknowledgement by Mr
Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, that he had advised IRA leaders to
consider halting their armed campaign.
Later on Irish television he urged unionists to set aside their suspicions
in the interests of peace. He said: 'If we are prepared to say let's put the
last 25 years behind us . . . surely the unionists have within their ranks
men and women of courage prepared to take the same risks as some of us have
taken.'
Senior Ulster Unionists appeared last night to have accepted London's
assurances , with Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader, expressing confidence
the government had no plans to change Ulster's constitutional position.
But the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party,
warned angrily that a ceasefire achieved through the surrender of the
British government could be 'a recipe for civil war'. Both men to meet Mr
Major within the next few days.
Early indications suggested loyalist paramilitaries were determined to
continue their armed campaign.
A huge 550 lb booby-trap bomb was defused by security forces in Co Tyrone
last night. Another bomb exploded at the Fort Whiterock Army base in the
republican Turf Lodge area of Belfast. No injuries were reported.

FT  31 AUG 94 / Invasion of Haiti edges a step closer
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US and Caribbean governments yesterday moved closer to launching a
multinational invasion force against Haiti, as the United Nations warned
that diplomatic efforts to oust the military leadership had failed.
Momentum for a military coalition grew when Jamaica, Barbados, Belize and
Trinidad-Tobago indicated they would commit a small number of troops to a
Haiti force. The Bahamas, Guyana and Antigua are also considering joining.
The Caribbean countries' decision is a victory for the US, which wants at
least symbolic contingents from allies to move in behind an initial wave of
US troops. The four nations will supply a total of about 266 soldiers as
part of a force estimated by US officials at about 10,000.
They announced their backing at a meeting of the Caribbean Community
(Caricom) in Kingston, Jamaica, attended by Mr Strobe Talbott, US deputy
secretary of state, and Mr John Deutch, deputy defence secretary.
'The time for action has arrived,' Mr Deutch said. 'There can be no doubt in
anybody's mind that the multinational force is going to Haiti.'
Another senior US official said that the US was not yet at the point of
invasion 'but we are moving briskly in that direction. . . We are very close
to exhausting all peaceful means'.
The US won a UN mandate last month to use 'all necessary means' to oust the
military elite who deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide three years ago.
In New York, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, said the last
peaceful efforts to persuade Haiti's rulers to step down had failed as 'the
military people in Haiti refused to talk with my special representative'. He
said there were no plans to continue the diplomatic mission unless there was
a new mandate from the Security Council.
Mr Boutros Ghali implied the next step would be up to the US. The Security
Council or the group of states who 'sought the mandate. . . will have to
take their own decision', he said.
The stepping up of US rhetoric follows criticism that the Haiti issue had
been put on the back burner as the Cuban refugee crisis gripped the
attention of the Clinton administration. But the US on Monday reiterated the
'determination of the international community to take all the necessary
means to bring the early restoration of democracy'.
Mr Deutch said training for the multinational force was expected to begin
immediately at a military base in Puerto Rico.

FT  30 AUG 94 / TV people meter alarms Japan's networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Times are tough for Japan's television networks. Advertising revenues have
fallen for two consecutive years, the competitors - satellite and cable
television - are getting stronger, and all this is happening as growth in
the number of viewers has become stunted.
Now the networks face another headache: the people meter. Already used in
the US and Europe, the people meter is the new television ratings system by
AC Nielsen Japan, the Japanese arm of the US television rating and marketing
group.
By providing more precise and timely information on who is watching what,
the device can change the country's television advertising market, the
second largest in the world at Y1,589bn (Dollars 16.05bn), by influencing
programme schedules and advertisement rates.
The concept of television viewer ratings and its use for advertising rates
was brought to Japan by Nielsen in 1960. However, Dentsu, the largest
advertising agency, and the leading networks set up their own ratings
company, Video Research, two years later, which now holds a virtual monopoly
in Japan. With the people meter, Nielsen wants to regain its foothold.
The meters are also damaging for the networks because they can give
advertisers more bargaining clout in what is already a buyers' market. When
the people meter was launched in the US in 1988, US networks, which offer
ratings guarantees to advertisers, incurred sharp earnings falls because
they were getting lower Nielsen ratings than they were used to.
Nielsen's announcement earlier this month of its plan to introduce the
ratings system in Japan in November has triggered an outcry from television
networks. The commercial television networks' association last week demanded
that Nielsen retract its plan, saying the group's credibility would be hurt
if it failed to do so.
Mr Yasuhiro Urushido, an executive at a leading network and vice-chairman of
the association's committee on individual ratings argues that the people
meter had yet to be tested sufficiently. He also complains that a consensus
had yet to be reached between the potential users of the system - the
networks, advertisers, advertising agencies and the viewers.
However, corporate advertisers are behind the company. The Japan
Advertisers' Association has given the people meter its endorsement.
Corporations have become frustrated with the current ratings system based on
households and supplemented by information on individual viewers based on
diaries in which viewers list the programmes they watch.
Foreign advertising agencies, trying to break into the tightly guarded
Japanese market, have also welcomed Nielsen's move to provide fast,
target-group-oriented data.
The household ratings system gives automated data from 3,600 households
across the nation. However, the system fails to supply ample information to
advertisers wishing to target a certain age or gender group. Meanwhile, the
diaries, filled in by individual viewers for one week per month, rely on the
memories of those who can bother to keep them up to date.
Nielsen's system requires every viewer to push a button on a machine on top
of the television each time he or she watches television. Each member of a
Nielsen family will have a separate button, and a heat sensor which can
detect the number of people in front of a television set will beep a warning
if the number of buttons and viewers do not match.
The networks' association argues that the people meter still relies on the
diligence of the viewers to press the buttons, adding that the reliability
of the sensors are yet to be proven. It is unlikely, however, that opponents
of the system can prevent Nielsen starting its service.
Although the networks say they will not allow advertisement rates to be
based on Nielsen's ratings, they cannot stop corporate advertisers from
referring to the figures. An official at a US-based advertising agency says:
'Ratings are like a currency in the industry. The stronger and more widely
used one usually wins.'

FT  30 AUG 94 / West Bank agreement is signed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Israeli Major General Danny Rothschild (left) and Nabil Shaath, the chief
Palestine Liberation Organisation negotiator, pocket their pens yesterday
after signing an accord transferring the control of education, taxation,
health, welfare and tourism affairs in the occupied West Bank to Palestinian
hands.
The deal is the most important step in the Israeli-PLO autonomy process
since self-rule for the Palestinians of Gaza and Jericho came into effect
four months ago. The transfer of the education system has already been
completed, in advance of the start of the new school year.
At the signing, at the Erez crossing point between Israel and the Gaza
Strip. Mr Sha'ath said the accord 'proves that the peace process continues,
that it will not stop at Gaza and Jericho, that it will go through the West
Bank . . . that it is implementable.' The ceremony was delayed for a short
time by the PLO representatives, protesting at Israel's refusal on Sunday to
allow a Pakistani diplomat to enter the Gaza Strip. The diplomat had
intended to prepare the ground for a visit to Gaza by prime minister Benazir
Bhutto. She has since cancelled the planned trip.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Low Pay Network says abolition has meant pay cuts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The abolition of wages councils has resulted in significant pay cuts,
according to the Low Pay Network.
Wages councils used to give legal minimum pay rates to more than 2.5m
workers, mainly in hotels and catering, retail, hairdressing and clothing
manufacture. They were abolished last August.
A report published by the Low Pay Network, an organisation that seeks to
improve pay and conditions for low-paid workers, analysed nearly 6,000 jobs
offered in Jobcentres in sectors formerly covered by councils. In the retail
sector 25.2 per cent of jobs advertised were below the old minimum rates.

FT  30 AUG 94 / NHS union scorns pressure to curb claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE and Financial Times Reporters
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal College of Nursing yesterday became the first health service union
to indicate that it would use the pay rise of 4.7 per cent awarded to MPs as
a basis for its own next claim.
The college, traditionally one of the most moderate of public-sector unions,
said it would reject any government attempt in the coming pay review to
revive last year's pressure for 'an exceptionally modest increase'.
Mr Christopher Cordwell, a senior member of the college's industrial
relations team, said on BBC radio: 'Nurses have clearly delivered more
productivity by measures the government have themselves set down over the
last few years, and we expect that to be noted by the review body.
'The Royal College of Nursing has no problem with MPs being properly
rewarded, but against such a background, what we don't expect is the
government to repeat the pressure it exerted on the review body last year.'
Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, said it was
unfair for MPs to be awarded pay rises well above the rate of inflation
while workers in the public sector were expected to show restraint.
He said on BBC radio: 'If they are going to make these silly rules let them
keep them themselves.'
Doctors will step up opposition to proposals for performance-related pay in
the National Health Service at a special conference in London tomorrow, Alan
Pike writes.
The British Medical Association has called representatives from every
hospital in the country to the meeting. They are due to discuss an issue
that is bringing the medical profession into renewed confrontation with the
government.
Ministers have said a shift from the NHS's centralised pay structure to
locally determined performance pay must start this year. Mr Alan Langlands,
NHS chief executive, has written to local managers of hospitals and other
services telling them to prepare plans for the change by October, and have
local machinery in place by February.
The BMA regards the timetable as 'impractically short' and the principle of
performance pay as 'totally inappropriate to the work of the medical
profession'.
A BMA briefing paper, circulated to its local negotiating committees in
advance of the conference, says that performance-related pay for hospital
doctors would lead to increased emphasis on financial objectives, resulting
in a greater focus on the number of patients treated rather than the quality
of care.

FT  30 AUG 94 / BMA gathers opponents of pay reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Doctors will step up opposition to proposals for performance-related pay in
the National Health Service at a special conference in London tomorrow.
The British Medical Association has called representatives from every
hospital in the country to the meeting. They are due to discuss an issue
that is bringing the medical profession into renewed confrontation with the
government.
Ministers have declared that a shift from the NHS's centralised pay
structure to locally determined, performance-based pay must start this year.
Mr Alan Langlands, NHS chief executive, has written to local managers of
hospitals and other services telling them to prepare plans for the change by
October, and have local pay machinery in place by February.
The BMA regards the timetable as 'impractically short' and the principle of
performance pay as 'totally inappropriate to the work of the medical
profession'.
This week's conference will seek to set the BMA's opposition in the context
of wider public-sector concerns about the weakening of centralised pay
structures. Representatives of both the Police Federation and the First
Division Association, the senior civil servants' union, will address the
meeting.
A BMA briefing paper, circulated to its local negotiating committees in
advance of the conference, says that performance-related pay for hospital
doctors would lead to increased emphasis on financial objectives, resulting
in a greater focus on the number of patients treated rather than the quality
of care.
It says: 'Local performance pay could be used by hospital managers to
pressurise consultants into compliance with the hospital's business needs -
for example giving greater priority to the patients of GP fundholders, or
doing a larger number of minor operations rather than more serious cases
which might generate less money for the hospital.'
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, has said that local pay
arrangements would encourage and promote good clinical practice.

AT&amp;T Global Information Solutions, formerly NCR, plans to withdraw from the
semiconductor market and is seeking a buyer for its NCR microelectronic
products division.
NCR was acquired by AT&amp;T in 1991 and renamed AT&amp;T Global Information
Solutions this year. The NCR semiconductor operation has continued to
operate independently rather than being integrated with AT&amp;T's existing
semiconductor operations.
AT&amp;T's Microelectronic Division, which had estimated 1993 sales of more than
Dollars 1bn, is not affected by the sale, the company said.
With sales last year of Dollars 372m, the NCR division employs almost 2,000
people at two semiconductor plants in Colorado as well as a plant in
Wichita, Kansas, that makes personal computer circuit boards, and Utrecht,
in the Netherlands, where a wireless data communications product line has
been developed.
The division is profitable and its sales have been growing at about 25 per
cent per year, the company said.
Morgan Stanley has been retained to find a buyer. The New York-based
investment banking firm has sent out prospectuses and is now evaluating
non-binding proposals of interest, the company said.
While the company would not estimate a market value for the operations, it
said it was prepared to aggressively negotiate with suitable potential
buyers for a speedy transaction.
The company said that the decision to sell the semiconductor operations
followed a business portfolio analysis. 'It no longer fits strategically
with our business plan,' a spokesman said.

FT  30 AUG 94 / International Company News: ITT plans to double 35% stake in
Ciga
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITT, the US conglomerate which owns Sheraton Hotels, is proposing to double
its 35 per cent stake in Ciga, the Italian luxury hotels group, with a
public offer for a further 35.25 per cent of the company's ordinary shares.
The US company is understood to have proposed an offer of about L1,100 a
share to Consob, the Italian stock market watchdog which must now approve
the terms of the bid.
The formal offer could be launched on September 16, when the next Milan
stock exchange trading account opens, six weeks after Consob first announced
that ITT would have to launch a bid.
Ciga's vociferous minority shareholders are already upset by the way in
which the gradual takeover of the Italian group has been handled. The way in
which the offer terms were disclosed last night could fuel their irritation.
The terms of the offer appeared yesterday evening in news agency reports,
quoting Consob sources, but there was no official communication from the
watchdog.
ITT has had little difficulty lifting its stake in Ciga to 35 per cent with
recent purchases on the market. It has also installed three directors on the
seven-strong board of the Italian group.
Last night, the US company would say only that it was intending to comply
with all Italian regulations, but it would not confirm that an offer had
been made.
If the new offer is successful, according to the terms which emerged last
night, ITT will have spent a total of more than L800bn (Dollars 505m)
acquiring a 70 per cent holding in Ciga, originally controlled by the Aga
Khan. But some minority shareholders may not accept the bid, which is set at
only a slight premium to yesterday's market price of L1,087.
ITT was forced to take a roundabout route to control of Ciga when its
original complex plan to acquire the hotels group from its creditor banks
for about L900bn failed.

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's anti-inflation plan, launched in July, suffered its first serious
setback yesterday when the government's main inflation index showed a
smaller than expected fall. The index, the IPC-R, showed inflation at 5.46
per cent for the four weeks to August 15, compared to 6.08 per cent in the
previous four-week period. The index appears to have remained high because
of rent increases and a lower than expected drop in clothing prices. The
government sought to play down the figure, claiming it contained 'one-off
factors' and pointing out private sector indices showed monthly inflation
has fallen to about 2 per cent. But the IPC-R is the main index the
government uses to judge pay awards. The August figure will be used to
attack Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, former finance minister, who engineered
the anti-inflation plan. He leads polls for October's presidential elections
mainly because electors credit him with taming Brazil's inflation, which
reached 50 per cent in the month before the plan's launch.

Crew members of a Russian ship stranded in a Ukrainian port for six months
have run out of food and soon will have no choice but to try to outrun the
Ukrainian coast guard, the ship's captain said yesterday. The Russian ship
Modul was detained by Ukrainian authorities at the Crimean port of
Evpatoria. It has a cargo of 60 tonnes of Ukrainian ammunition for Angola.
But the Ukrainian suppliers wanted the delivery stopped as they had not
received payment from Angola. 'If Moscow and Kiev do not help the Russian
sailors, my crew will only have one option: to try to break past the border
and outrun the Ukrainian coast-guard,' Captain Leonid Volfovsky told a
Russian news agency. He said a Russian official had come on board to try to
resolve the dispute. One solution might be to load the contested cargo on to
another Russian ship.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Adams tells IRA leaders time may be right to end violence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes that the IRA might be poised to call an imminent ceasefire rose again
last night after Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, told republican
leaders that the conditions could be right for an end to violence in
Northern Ireland.
In his first public acknowledgement that he has advised IRA leaders to
consider halting their 25-year armed campaign, Mr Adams said he had always
argued that 'a changed political climate could break the . . . stalemate and
create the potential to eradicate the underlying causes of conflict'.
'In my updated assessment to the IRA leadership I expressed my belief that
the current political climate provides that potential,' he said.
The IRA leadership assured him that it would 'study my assessment of the
present political situation and that it will make a speedy response to it'.
His comments came as Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social
Democratic and Labour Party, called for talks with Sinn Fein, the IRA's
political wing, to start as soon as possible after a genuine end to IRA
violence.
Some 24 hours after issuing a joint statement with Mr Adams saying that the
'essential ingredients' for an approach to peace might now be available, Mr
Hume said: 'If violence has genuinely stopped, the next step has to be
dialogue and I would like to see that begin as soon as possible.'
He also responded to scathing unionist criticism of his joint statement,
saying: 'They don't seem to be listening to what I am saying. We have said
that a new agreement is only viable if it enjoys the allegiance of the
different traditions on this island.'
The air of optimism was reinforced by Cardinal Cahal Daly, leader of the
Irish Catholic church, who said Northern Ireland could be on the brink of
the best opportunity for peace in 25 years.
But it was tempered by unionist leaders, who voiced fears that Britain might
be preparing to make concessions in return for a ceasefire.
Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, is likely to raise
such concerns with Mr John Major at a meeting expected to be held in a few
days.
Mr Molyneaux yesterday accused Mr Hume of 'selling his soul to the devil and
joining in a sordid attempt to blackmail the British, American and Irish
governments into giving the Armalite supremacy over the ballot box'.
The outlawed loyalist Ulster Freedom Fighters warned last night that
loyalists would not sit back and be 'coerced or persuaded' into a united
Ireland.
Mr Kevin McNamara, shadow Ulster secretary, warned unionists against trying
to block political progress, saying that they should be reassured by
guarantees in the Downing Street declaration that there would be no
reunification without the consent of the majority in Ulster.
The British and Irish governments have repeatedly stressed that a total
cessation of violence would be required before Sinn Fein could be admitted
to the all-party talks process.
Mr Adams said that much common ground had been established by Sinn Fein, the
SDLP and Dublin 'with the strong support of Irish-American opinion' and that
the 'potential now exists to move the situation towards a democratic and
peaceful settlement'.
'If such a settlement - the basis for lasting peace - is to be found there
must be fundamental and thorough-going change,' he said. 'I am satisfied
that Irish nationalism, if properly mobilised and focused at home and
internationally, now has sufficient political confidence, weight and support
to bring about the changes which are essential to a just and lasting peace.'
Mr Adams called for 'equality of treatment, equality of opportunity and
parity of esteem across the entire political, economic, cultural, social,
legal and security spectrum'.

FT  30 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Commerce data take Dow up again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
The stock market's surprising rally stayed alive yesterday as share prices
tended to move higher in spite of a receding bond market, writes Frank
McGurty in New York.
By the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 17.80 stronger at
3,898.85, building on last week's powerful 125-point advance. The Standard
&amp;Poor's 500 added 0.79 at 474.59, while rises on the Big Board outnumbered
declines by 1,230 to 897. New York SE volume was a moderate 266m shares. The
American SE composite gained 1.90 at 451.46 and the Nasdaq composite inched
0.27 forward to 764.21.
Early on, modest gains by bonds and a further improvement by the dollar
provided a supportive backdrop for stocks. The catalyst was welcome news
from the Commerce Department that July personal income had risen 0.5 per
cent from the previous month's figure, while personal consumption had edged
0.2 per cent higher. Both figures were consistent with the prevailing view
that the economy was growing at a manageable pace.
By mid-morning, however, the dollar reversed direction. Bonds followed suit
in thin, summertime activity. Although these developments caused stocks to
stumble at times during the session, a majority held on to finish with
encouraging gains.
Still, many of the cyclical issues which had led the blue chips last week
paused yesterday. Caterpillar was unchanged at Dollars 115 5/8 and General
Motors dipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 51 3/8 .
But International Paper remained strong, leading a generally buoyant paper
and pulp sector with a gain of Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 74 5/8 . Elsewhere in
the group, Stone Container climbed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 19 5/8 and
Georgia Pacific put on Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 72 7/8 .
McDonald's was marked up Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 27 7/8 on favourable press
comment about the company's growth prospects.
Merger and acquisition news figured prominently in the activity. ITT dropped
Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 81 7/8 after agreeing to pay a premium price for
Viacom's Madison Square Garden businesses. Its partner, Cablevision, added
Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 58, while Viacom held at Dollars 38 1/4 .
The pharmaceuticals industry appeared to be poised for further consolidation
follow-ing Marion Merrell Dow's announcement that it was exploring a
possible sale of the company. Dow Chemical, its majority owner, jumped
Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 73 7/8 on the news, while MMD was raised Dollars 1
7/8 to Dollars 24 1/8 .
On the Nasdaq, Nextel tumbled Dollars 5 1/4 to Dollars 25 1/4 . Investors
were surprised by the unravelling of its agreement to build a wireless
communications network with MCI and Comcast.
Canada
Toronto gained further ground in moderate trade as advancing gold and
transportation issues helped to fuel an afternoon rally. The TSE 300 index
ended 28.00 higher at 4,332.43 and rises led falls by 404 to 340 after
volume of 57.3m shares.
Twelve of the 14 sub-group indices made headway, with transportation
climbing 2.4 per cent. The golds sector strengthened 2.0 per cent as the
price of bullion in New York gained USDollars 3.70 at USDollars 387.15 an
ounce. Real estate had the day's biggest decline, 1.8 per cent.
Brazil
Sao Paulo closed 2.1 per cent up in mild trade after equity prices bounced
back from early losses on renewed confidence about the government's ongoing
economic plan.
Traders said optimism ahead of upcoming inflation figures, which are
expected to show August inflation at around 2 per cent, against the 5.46 per
cent posted yesterday by the government's official IPC-R index, provided
underpinning.
The Bovespa index gained a net 1,087 at 53,230. Volume totalled RDollars
289.8m (Dollars 323.9m).

FT  30 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): SBF acts to curb Euro Disney
bloodletting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The absence of UK business took its toll of bourse volume yesterday morning,
but the afternoon saw more action after a lively start on Wall Street,
writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS ended higher, the CAC 40 index advancing 12.53 to 2,075.27. But on a
thin day, with turnover of FFr2.4bn, any satisfaction professionals might
have had was marred by Euro Disney and Danone.
The leisure group, suspended limit down on Friday, was twice suspended
yesterday for the same reason as it fell by 10 per cent, and then by a
further 5 per cent. Finally, the French Bourses Association, SBF, said it
had put a FFr7.75 floor under the shares for the day, and would not execute
orders below that price.
Euro Disney was finally FFr1.10, or nearly 12 per cent, lower at FFr8.40
after bottoming out at FFr7.75, depressed by poor prospects and the lack of
apparent value in the stock.
Danone, the food group, dropped FFr32, or 3.8 per cent, to FFr814. Here, the
market liked neither the fall of 8 per cent in first-half profits, nor the
nomination of Mr Franck Riboud, son of the Danone chairman, to the board.
FRANKFURT ignored trenchant arguments expressed last week about the
expensiveness of its equity market, and continued to attach itself to US
stocks and bonds.
There was little real excitement about a 31.65 rise to 2,193.65 in the Dax
index on the session, because volume was inhibited by London's closure and
the session's gain little more than consolidated the post-bourse close of
2,190.58 last Friday. However, yesterday's post-bourse took the Ibis
indicated Dax up a further 25.14 to 2,215.72 as strength in the dollar
continued, and bund futures broke through resistance at 92.
The afternoon's big winners included both oversold defensive stocks and
recently popular cyclicals, Deutsche Bank and Bayernhypo closing the post
bourse up DM13.50 at DM431.50 and DM13.50 at DM740.50, and Bayer and Hoechst
gaining DM8 and DM8.80 respectively to DM379.50 and DM369.50.
ZURICH moved forward 2.1 per cent in active trade which saw the return of
some private investors on Wall Street and bond markets. The SMI index
finished 53.9 higher at 2,635.2, with the firm dollar proving a further
positive factor.
Among the banks, hard hit in the weeks since reporting six-month figures,
UBS bearers rose SFr34 to SFr1,160. One analyst noted that investors
appeared to be switching from SBC to UBS on reconsideration of its results
and in response to news that UBS had substantially increased its securities
portfolio in the first half of the year. CS Holding firmed SFr15 to SFr541.
Roche certificates rose SFr140 to SFr5,985, close to resistance at SFr6,000.
Ciba registered added SFr22 at SFr821 amid optimism that the group would
confirm hopes tomorrow that earnings were accelerating in its industrial and
agricultural sectors.
Sandoz, also with half-year results due later in the week, saw its bearers
advance SFr22 to SFr715.
Oerlikon-Buhrle, which released lower than expected half-year figures on
Saturday, slipped SFr3 to SFr145.
Bearer shares in Surveillance dropped SFr35, or 1.7 per cent, to SFr2,085
following news that the chief executive officer had stepped down.
AMSTERDAM took its cue from the stronger dollar and firmer US stocks, and
the AEX index gained 3.77 at 424.60.
Royal Dutch rose Fl 4.20 to Fl 199.80, the positive impact of the firm
dollar outweighing disappointing oil prices. Among other dollar earners, KLM
firmed 50 cents to Fl 53.00, Wolters Kluwer added Fl 2.20 at Fl 119.70, VNU
rose Fl 3.20 to Fl 184.90 and Elsevier put on Fl 2.80 at Fl 172.00.
MILAN was encouraged by signs of progress on the budget and the Comit index
picked up 9.10, or 1.3 per cent, to 694.70.
Insurance shares, strong last week, continued to find favour on expectations
that their private pension schemes would see an influx of funds from people
worried about future returns on state schemes. Over the weekend, Mr Giulio
Tremonti, the finance minister, also said he wanted to see a 15 per cent tax
on private pension funds scrapped.
INA gained L35 at L2,397, while Generali, Italy's largest insurance group,
ended L488 higher at L42,386.
Banks, underperformers in recent weeks, regained some ground on hopes that
they would also benefit from the spread of private pensions. Credito
Italiano rose L60 to L2,270 and BCI L55 to L3,835.
Elsewhere, Telecom Italia climbed L39 to L4,601 while Fiat firmed L60 to
L6,611.
HELSINKI featured a new high in metals and mining concern Outokumpu as the
Hex index strengthened 34.2, or 1.8 per cent, to 1,948.5.
Outokumpu added FM7 at FM106 on strong demand from foreign investors, and on
projections of a sharp rise in 1994 profits on higher base metals prices and
internal rationalisation measures.
TEL AVIV was expecting an increase in bank rate to combat inflation. It took
a 1.5 percentage points rise in its stride and the Mishtanim index recovered
5.68, or 3.3 per cent, to 179.94.
The FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index was unavailable yesterday because of the
English bank holiday.

Gold and mining shares came under pressure in thin trade, while industrials
were underpinned by Wall Street and recent corporate results. The overall
index lost 28 at 5,831, industrials eased 14 to 6,587 and golds gave up 27
at 2,242.

FT  30 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Conflicting influences on Stockholm
bourse - Swedish equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Swedish stock market has been getting plenty of what it likes in recent
weeks, as a stream of interim reports from the big multinationals have more
than matched expectations.
Unfortunately, there have been equally big doses of what it dislikes:
volatile interest rate and currency movements, lowered economic growth
forecasts and a lot of political uncertainty. Given the two competing
influences, it is not surprising that shares have struggled to make headway.
But making headway they are. Progress is modest but equities are still in
positive territory for the year to date. At yesterday's close, the
Affarsvarlden General index stood at 1,462.30, up 3.40 on the day.
The central bank's increase in key interest rates earlier this month, the
first for nearly two years, gave the stock market its biggest jolt since the
country's November 1992 devaluation. In three days, shares plunged by 5 per
cent, wiping out the year's entire advance.
The mood remains nervous. Sweden is entering the run-up to September's
general election and a referendum on membership of the European Union in
November. The markets are fast becoming reconciled to the prospects of a
Social Democratic government, which is well ahead in the polls, but they are
still troubled about the state of the country's finances.
The SKr61bn budget strengthening programme which the Social Democrats
announced 10 days ago has brought bond yields down; but there is a
widespread feel-ing that the sums are inadequate, and the market remains
unsettled.
Mr Mike Young, Merrill Lynch's director of European investment strategy,
says the market will remain nervous 'at least until we see what kind of
initial budget steps are taken' by the new government. 'The market can only
discount probabilities until we see reality,' he adds. Among other things,
the Social Democrats plan to increase capital gains taxes and restore double
taxation of dividends.
Bond and stock markets have decoupled somewhat in recent days, with shares
managing to climb in spite of bond market volatility. This is partly because
there is rising optimism about the corporate outlook and a Swedish entry
into the EU. Even so, equities remain overshadowed by developments in the
bond market, not least because rising long-term interest rates have led to a
readjustment of economic growth rate projections.
The general view now is that Sweden's economy will grow by 1.5 per cent to
2.0 per cent this year, rather less than the 2.0 per cent to 2.5 per cent
forecast earlier. The gloomier tone was reinforced last week when several
leading banks indicated that their 1994 results would be hit by worries over
the state of the economy.
In spite of this, shares have been making headway precisely because the
country's blue chips, with 80 to 90 per cent of their sales abroad, are so
insulated from the problems in the domestic economy. Indeed, they may
benefit from a difficult economic climate at home if it holds down wage
costs and prices and keeps the Swedish currency weak.
The current results season has provided plenty of cheer, with a string of
impressive results from such heavyweights as SKF, Ericsson and Electrolux.
Companies still to report, including Astra, the high-flying pharmaceuticals
specialist, and Volvo, are also expected to produce spectacular figures.
Astra, the biggest Swedish company by market capitalisation, has seen a
particularly strong rise in its share price over the last few days in a run
which has partly been fuelled by takeover speculation.
One sector which is experiencing a particular revival is pulp and paper,
where rising prices and operating rates are starting to feed a strong
profits recovery. Stora, Europe's biggest pulp and paper group, confirmed
this trend last week, increasing profits to SKr1.51bn from SKr30m.
The 25 per cent fall in the value of the krona over the last two years,
heavy cost-cutting and the improving economic outlook in the US and Europe
provide the platform from which the strong corporate revival is being made.
It explains why Kleinwort Benson in London was expecting Swedish corporates'
first-half operating profits to improve by 107 per cent and pre-tax profits
by 141 per cent even before the interim reporting season got under way. And
it explains why the market has its supporters even during the current
turbulence.
In the longer term, the market's ability to outperform will still depend on
the political arena. Should the next few months produce a 'yes' to Europe
and a tough budget strengthening package, interest rates should fall on a
strengthening krona.
This would provide a solid background for further equity market gains,
especially as corporate profits are expected to make further advances next
year. A vote against joining Europe, on the other hand, would undoubtedly
cast a deep shadow over the market.
This is why a number of analysts remain cautious in the short term but more
optimistic over a longer time frame. Mike Young of Merrill Lynch expects the
Swedish market to underperform over the next three to six months, but
outperform on a 12-month view.

FT  30 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Taipei rises 1.3 per
cent to four-year high
</HEADLINE>

Tokyo
Arbitrage and dealer buying outweighed selling by institutional investors,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo, and the Nikkei 225 average gained 128.93 at
20,600.42 after a day's low of 20,518.80 and high of 20,722.84.
A rise in the futures market prompted by the easing of the yen and Friday's
rally on Wall Street triggered arbitrage buying in the morning. In the
afternoon, the index faced profit-taking by institutional investors booking
profits ahead of the September book closing.
The Topix index of all first section stocks was finally 4.39 ahead at
1,640.08 and the Nikkei 300 up 0.76 at 298.37. Advances led declines by 592
to 327, with 222 issues unchanged.
Traders said that while buying orders from public funds were putting a floor
under the market, the Nikkei 225 lacked the support to rise above 21,000.
'There seem to be a lot of selling orders from corporations around the
20,700 level,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities. Overseas investors
remained on the buying side, and supported the steel sector.
Volume contracted from 233m shares to 206m, most investors staying inactive
ahead of the Japan Tobacco auction results. The auction for 230,000 JT
shares, which will be listed on October 27, drew bids between Y1.36m and
Y2.11m per share yesterday. The government will announce the public offering
price of the remaining 436,666 shares to be offered publicly tomorrow.
Brokers were hoping that the listing of Japan Tobacco and Japan Telecom will
revitalise the equity market. Telecommunication linked stocks have been
traded actively in recent days ahead of Japan Telecom's listing next week.
DDI, the telecom operator listed on the second section, climbed Y19,000 to
Y1.01m, and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone added Y5,000 at Y885,000. Nippon
Comsys, a telecom engineer, put on Y30 at Y1,590 and Nitsuko, a telephone
equipment maker, moved up Y20 to Y1,560.
High-technology issues were higher on the firmer dollar. Sony advanced Y70
to Y5,900 and Victor rose Y50 to Y1,370. However, Fujitsu eased Y10 to
Y1,070 on profit-taking, while Toshiba declined Y6 to Y746.
In Osaka, the OSE average firmed 91.49 to 22,926.70 in volume of 48.3m
shares. Roundup
Wall Street's performance on Friday underpinned a solid showing in some
regional markets. Hong Kong was closed for a public holiday.
TAIPEI moved ahead 1.3 per cent to a four-year high, breaching the
7,000-point level in heavy buying of marine and financial issues. The
weighted index was up 87.48 at 7,040.52, after touching 7,069.86, in active
turnover of TDollars 100bn.
Shipping stocks, which had lagged behind in previous rallies, were major
gainers on good profits outlooks. Yang Ming Marine climbed TDollars 1.90 to
TDollars 37.50 and Evergreen Marine rose TDollars 3.50 to TDollars 55.50.
SYDNEY finished 1.7 per cent higher in good volume, finding additional
support in a strong index futures contract. The All Ordinaries index rose
34.7 to 2,111.8.
WELLINGTON took its lead from the stronger Australian market, the NZSE-40
Capital index advancing 35.40 to 2,141.28. Fletcher Challenge, expected to
report sharply higher profits tomorrow, appreciated 9 cents to NZDollars
4.07.
BOMBAY saw strong demand over a broad front on the first day of the account,
in specified as well as cash shares, ahead of today's public holiday. The
BSE 30-share index closed 94.9 higher at 4,525.25.
SINGAPORE was firmer, with some buying of blue chips boosting an otherwise
quiet market ahead of tomorrow's public holiday. Malaysian shares traded
over the counter, which led gains in recent weeks, trickled downwards in the
afternoon. The Straits Times Industrial index ended 12.29 stronger at
2,305.80.
KUALA LUMPUR was mixed in sluggish trading as blue-chip utilities rose while
the broader market fared less well and gaming stocks faltered. The composite
index edged forward 8.59 to 1,120.37.
SEOUL finished lower in thin trading and the composite index dipped 5.17 to
936.01 in volume of just 24.54m shares, well below last week's daily average
of 32.4m.

FT  30 AUG 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney asks watchdog to
probe share price slide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Euro Disney, the troubled leisure group, is to ask the Paris stock market
authorities to investigate the recent fall in its shares, which yesterday
were twice suspended after plunging to a record low.
The group, which recently concluded negotiations with its banks for a
FFr13bn (Dollars 2.4bn) financial rescue, saw its shares end the day 11.6
per cent down at FFr8.40 having plummeted to FFr7.75 during the morning.
The shares were also suspended on Friday after a sharp fall.
Euro Disney said that it had requested the Commission des Operations de
Bourse, the Paris watchdog, to analyse why its shares had fallen so sharply,
given that it had not released any new information over the past few days.
Analysts attributed the decline in Euro Disney's shares to nervousness about
the company's trading prospects and to concern about the implications of
recent senior management changes at both Euro Disney and Walt Disney, its US
parent.
Mr Mike Montgomery, Euro Disney's well-regarded finance director, announced
his resignation two weeks ago.
His departure aggravated fears of a poor performance from Euro Disney, which
is said to have had weak attendance levels this summer in spite of
price-cutting and promotional initiatives.
The news of Mr Montgomery's departure was followed by the surprise
resignation of Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg, the high-profile head of Walt Disney's
film division.
The Disney parent company is still unsettled after the sudden death of Mr
Frank Wells, its president, and the illness of Mr Michael Eisner, its
chairman who recently underwent heart surgery. Walt Disney played a
prominent role in Euro Disney's emergency restructuring.

FT  30 AUG 94 / International Company News: Sharp rise at Arnott's to
ADollars 81m

<TEXT>
Arnott's, the Australian food group now majority-owned by Campbell Soup of
the US, yesterday reported a sharp improvement in profits after tax and
abnormals in the year to July 1.
The company made ADollars 81.1m (USDollars 60.3m), compared with ADollars
47.2m previously.
However, the advance was partly due to the absence of abnormal charges,
which took ADollars 32.9m off the result last time.
Operating profit before abnormals and tax rose by a more modest 5.5 per cent
to ADollars 116.5m, while sales dipped from ADollars 636.2m to ADollars
622.5m - largely due to the sale of some non-core businesses, including
White Rose Flour Mills and Illawarra Jam.
Arnott's said revenues from its core Australian biscuit division were
marginally ahead of the previous year, but trading profits for the division
were affected by a Prices Surveillance Authority review. During the period
of the inquiry, companies are precluded from seeking price rises.
Sales in New Zealand were slightly down, and trading profits lower. However,
in Papua New Guinea, sales and trading profits - after adjusting for asset
sales - rose 'significantly'.
Arnott's said its push into Asia was 'proceeding well'. It plans to start
distributing products in Korea in the final quarter of 1994, and is
targeting Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and India 'in the
longer term'.
There is a final dividend of 17 cents a share, taking the full-year payout
to 32 cents, compared with 29 cents previously.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries mixed in thin trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasuries were mixed yesterday afternoon in a quiet session influenced
by a wavering dollar and some favourable economic data.
Late in the day, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  7/32 lower at 99
23/32 , with the yield edging up to 7.496 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was unchanged at 100 3/32 , to yield 6.183 per cent.
Bonds opened on a solid footing as traders welcomed news from the Commerce
Department that July personal income had appreciated 0.5 per cent from the
previous month, while personal spending edged 0.2 per cent ahead.
Both figures were in line with expectations. By offering further evidence of
moderate economic growth and low inflationary pressures, the data helped
buttress the growing conviction in the market that the Federal Reserve would
delay its next move to tighter money until November. The dollar, which was
firmer against other leading currencies, provided additional support for
bonds in the early session.
As a result, the long end of the maturity range took a modest step forward,
building on Friday's moderate gains. However, the improvement proved to be
short-lived as the 30-year issue soon receded into negative territory.
The retreat was partly explained by the thin trading conditions. Many
traders were on holiday while others were holding off on fresh commitments
until the release of August employment data at the end of the week. The
report should confirm whether the market's confidence in the economy has
been justified.
But the US currency also contributed to the downward drift. The long bond
closely traced the dollar as it reversed direction at mid-morning and sagged
to about Y100 by late afternoon.
European government bonds pushed further ahead yesterday following Friday's
strong rally, but trading volumes were small with London markets closed for
the UK summer bank holiday.
The early firmer tone to US Treasuries benefited European markets, but
analysts said that further gains in Europe would be limited by concerns
about fresh supply.
Yesterday saw auctions of Dutch and Swedish government debt and the launch
of four-year paper for the German Treasury. Further auctions in Germany,
France and Italy are scheduled for later this week.
'After Friday's rally there is a better tone to the market,' said Mr Carl
Haeling, head of Deutsche Bank's futures and options group in Frankfurt.
'But attention this week is on the huge supply across the whole of Europe,
which is a particular worry for the German market and could mean a reversal
of some of last week's gains.'
In Germany, the five-year German government bond futures contract on DTB,
the Frankfurt futures exchange, continued to significantly outperform the
rest of the market.
'This is the story of the moment,' said Mr Haeling. 'It has the makings of a
fairly serious short squeeze over the next couple of days.'
French government bonds moved higher in line with Germany and the US. Market
attention is turning to Thursday's monthly government bond auction.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said at the weekend that the
Treasury would launch its previously announced OAT sales to small investors
in October. The scheme aims to raise about FFr10bn a year.
'This is a clear change in the policy of the government and is an important
step in updating the French market to international standards to attract
foreign investors,' said Mr Christophe Servan, bond analyst at Paribas
Capital Markets in Paris.
'After the bond crisis in the first half of this year, everybody could see
that retail investors feel more comfortable with holding bonds directly
rather than through intermediaries, such as investment funds,' he said.

Accor Asia Pacific, the Asian hotels group which is listed in Australia,
said yesterday that it had signed an agreement allowing its brands -
including Sofitel, Novotel and Mercure  - to be used in Vietnam.
It has signed a franchise agreement with a 104-room hotel in Ho Chi Minh
City, which will now be known as the Hotel Mercure Saigon, and a management
agreement for a second property there, to be called the Hotel Sofitel Dalat
Palace.
The latter property is being refurbished and is scheduled to be fully
operational by December.
Accor also said that it had signed a technical and management agreement for
a 130-room Novotel hotel to be built in Dalat and opened in 1996.
Simsmetal, the acquisitive Australian scrap-metal company with interests in
the UK, yesterday reported a profit after tax of ADollars 46.9m (USDollars
34.9m) in the year to the end of June, compared with ADollars 22.9m in the
previous 12 months.
Sales were up to ADollars 742.7m from ADollars 574.7m, and earnings per
share rose to 63.8 cents from 25.6 cents

FT  30 AUG 94 / International Bonds: Finland launches DM1.25bn FRN issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Republic of Finland enlivened an otherwise quiet eurobond market
yesterday as it continued its financing activities with the launch of a
DM1.25bn eight-year floating rate note.
The notes, issued via a consortium of banks, carried an interest rate of
1/16 per cent over the London interbank offered rate (Libor) with an issue
price of 99.76, said lead manager Commerzbank.
There was good demand for the new issue, especially from domestic German
institutions, the lead managers said. They also reported some interest from
smaller continental European banks.
This latest deal by the Republic of Finland follows deals earlier in August
when it tapped the Canadian dollar and Luxembourg franc sectors.
After the last issue, finance ministry officials said Finland planned to
borrow at least Dollars 2bn more in the international capital markets this
year.
The latest bond will be value-dated September 16, 1994 and is scheduled for
a listing on the Frankfurt securities exchange, officials said.
Elsewhere, the Greek government announced that it will issue one-year and
three-year dollar-linked bonds at 6.3 per cent and 7.75 per cent annually,
and one-year and three-year fixed rate Ecu-linked bonds at 7.1 per cent and
8.8 per cent annually.
The bonds will be issued tomorrow and their rates will be fixed and
tax-free, the finance ministry said.
The Bank of Yokohama announced that it was planning to launch euroyen
subordinated bonds in September.
Details have yet to be decided, a spokesman said. Subordinated bonds are
generally issued to raise capital adequacy ratios, bank officials said.

<TEXT>
Rabobank, the Dutch co-operative bank, lifted net profit by 11.4 per cent to
Fl 654m (Dollars 370m) in the first half from Fl 587m a year earlier, due to
strong growth in lending to the corporate sector.
Interest income rose by 7.4 per cent to Fl 3.07bn. Rabobank said continuing
economic recovery had led to a higher rate of investment by corporate
clients in trade, industry and services.
Commission income rose by 12.2 per cent to Fl 553m, with much of the growth
due to securities business and to demand for investment funds managed by the
Robeco Group.
Rabobank's trading on its own account was hit by the sudden increase in
interest rates early in 1994. Its results on financial transactions fell
into a loss of Fl 19m from a profit of Fl 129m a year earlier.

ADollars 26m at midway

<TEXT>
Comalco, the Australian aluminium producer controlled by CRA, unveiled
after-tax profits of ADollars 26.9m (USDollars 20m) for the half-year to
end-June, sharply reduced from the ADollars 42.8m in the same period of
1993, writes Nikki Tait.
The figures, calculated on the statutory basis (rather than on a
joint-venture basis which includes Comalco's equity in the results of
consortium companies) contained no abnormal items for 1994, but a ADollars
11.4m charge the previous year.
Revenues were ADollars 1.13bn, compared with ADollars 1.14bn.
The company said gains in prices had been partly offset by a less favourable
USDollars /ADollars exchange rate, and its smelting business operated at a
loss in the first half. 'However, at present metal prices this business
could return to modest profitability', it added.
Comalco said the metal market remained 'fragile'and LME stocks were still at
high levels. 'Overhanging the market is a substantial amount of unused
smelting capacity.
However, in the important Japanese and European markets, the economic
outlook is brightening and metal consumption is expected to increase,' it
said.

A rise in international seafood prices and improved domestic retail sales
helped Irvin and Johnson, the South African food processing company, to
increase after-tax income 9 per cent to R62.2m (Dollars 13.7m) from R57.08m
for the year ending in June.
In spite of a 7 per cent fall in sales volumes, due largely to a decline in
chicken supplies and a planned reduction in low-value seafood production,
turnover rose 8 per cent to R1.77bn from R1.65bn.
Operating income increased only 5 per cent to R88.26m from R84.19m, but a 14
per cent drop in tax paid, to R15.9m from R18.6m, helped improve overall
results.
The dividend was unchanged at 83 cents.
The company said it was pressing ahead with an accelerated capital
investment project to improve overall international competitiveness, noting
that new capital expenditure for the year to June was R77.76m and that a
further R35.2m had already been authorised.
I&amp;J also announced it had reduced its shareholding in Namibia-based Kuiseb
fish products through an issue of new shares to Namibian partners, leaving
it with a 49 per cent interest in Kuiseb.

FT  30 AUG 94 / International Company News: MCI drops plan to buy 17% stake
in Nextel

<TEXT>
Shares of Nextel Communications, the US wireless communications company,
fell sharply yesterday when MCI cancelled an agreement to acquire a 17 per
cent stake in the company.
Nextel has ambitious plans for a US-wide service combining mobile voice,
data, paging and dispatch radio services.
It was trading at Dollars 24 3/4 in mid-session yesterday, finally closing
at Dollars 25 1/4 for a net loss of Dollars 5 1/4 on the day.
In February, MCI agreed to pay Dollars 1.3bn for 17 per cent of Nextel
shares. The telephone company was to become Nextel's marketing partner in
its bid to create a nationwide wireless communications network.
Comcast, another Nextel shareholder, was also a party to the agreement.
Yesterday, the companies said they were continuing to explore the
possibility of a strategic alliance, but on different terms.
Since February, when MCI signed a letter of intent with Nextel and Comcast,
Nextel's share price has fallen from Dollars 42.
Analysts said MCI may have been renegotiating the price it agreed to pay for
Nextel shares, which was Dollars 36 a share for an initial tranche and
Dollars 38 for additional shares to be purchased over a three-year period.
Also, since the initial agreement with MCI was signed, Nextel has announced
planned acquisitions of OneComm and Dial Page and the purchase of Motorola's
specialised mobile radio licences, mostly for stock.
The issuance of new stock would have diluted MCI's planned stake in Nextel
to about 12 per cent.
News of MCI's decision to pull out of the deal with Nextel hit the share
prices of OneComm and Dial Page as analysts speculated that Nextel may
reassess its plans to acquire the two companies.
However, Nextel said its planned deals would go ahead.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Survey of Malaysia (10): Factories' Achilles heel -
Immigrants fail to ease skilled labour shortage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The colourful banners fluttering outside what seems like every other
Malaysian factory signify an increasingly rare phenomenon: a seller's market
for labour.
The banners invite passers-by to walk-in interviews for a wide range of
production jobs, with no previous experience required. The lack of
Malaysians taking up the invitations is, however, stoking up wage-pressure
and intensifying the debate about how the country shifts from assembly-based
operations - premised on cheap labour  - to a high wage, high value-added,
manufacturing base.
The country has reached full employment (unemployment this year will be
below 3 per cent of the 8m workforce) six years before planned, with jobs
growth outstripping labour force growth 3.2 per cent to 2.8 per cent since
1988.
The difficulty of finding workers is a constant refrain of Malaysian
businessmen. And when workers are found they often have that bothersome
self-confidence associated with full employment. 'When they come it is not
us interviewing them it is them inteviewing us about fringe benefits,' says
an exasperated Chinese business leader.
Not surprisingly, wages have been rising rapidly although there is some
dispute about how rapidly. In the electronics sector, official surveys show
wages rising at over 10 per cent per year, while inflation hovers around 4
per cent.
But electronics workers are an elite benefiting from big productivity
increases and booming demand in the mainly foreign owned plants. They
comfortably top the monthly average earnings table on MDollars 886, ahead of
furniture workers. On some estimates average monthly earnings for the
200,000 electronics workers are over MDollars 1,000.
The picture for the economy as a whole is less dramatic with the Manpower
Department estimating that earnings increased by only 5 per cent in the
economy in 1993, compared with 8.7 per cent in 1992. But it is not clear
whether those figures capture the growing array of fringe benefits or the 10
per cent annual seniority increments usually built into collective
agreements.
Collective bargaining only covers about 20 per cent of the workforce, but
the figure is closer to 50 per cent in the manufacturing sector which has
just overtaken agriculture, forestry and fishing as the biggest category of
employment, now covering about 25 per cent of the working population.
Nevertheless, Malaysia's rather dispirited trade unions cannot claim much of
the credit for the full-employment generated wage pressure. One measure of
that pressure is the dramatic rise in job-hopping.
Mr O K Lee of the northern branch of the Federation of Malaysian
Manufacturers, says annual labour turnover is now about 45 per cent in
Penang.
In response to the tight labour market employers have been allowed to bring
in more foreign workers - mainly from Indonesia and Bangladesh - usually on
five year contracts. This has helped to check wage pressure, especially in
the rubber plantations and in construction where the 1.5m official immigrant
workers are strongest.
But neither immigrant workers nor the latest government initiative to
restrain wage increases, expected in next year's budget, can alter the fact
that Malaysia is no longer a cheap labour economy.
The World Bank classifies Malaysia as an upper middle income country - and
therefore no longer a developing country - and its GDP per capita is nearly
Dollars 8,000 (using purchasing power parity) just above Greece, the poorest
European Union country.
For that reason some industrialists view the future in rather apocalyptic
terms. 'This situation is a trap. We cannot stand-still because we will
gradually lose more and more labour intensive foreign investment to lower
cost countries in the region. Yet we cannot move forward at the speed
required because we do not have a sufficiently educated workforce,' says a
businessman, who refuses to be named.
The argument, which quickly becomes a political one (hence the anonymity),
runs like this: Malaysia inherited from Britain an elitist, arts-inclined,
higher education system and very little technical or vocational training
infrastructure. This weakness was, however, compounded by the quota system
designed to promote the advance of the ethnic Malays and the compulsory use
of Malay as the language of instruction at all levels, both introduced in
the early 1970s.
The quality and quantity of the education provided in Malaysia by seven
universities, two colleges and five polytechnics, at a total annual cost of
about MDollars 1bn, has thus been inadequate. The result has been about
60,000 Malaysians studying abroad at any one time (many of them never
returning), one of the lowest per capita ratios of science and engineering
graduates in the region (with 63 per cent of graduates preferring arts
subjects), and only 7 per cent of Malaysians in the 20-24 age group in
tertiary education compared with 28 per cent in the Philippines and 16 per
cent in Thailand.
As a result, research and development claims only 0.8 per cent of GDP (and
most of that in agriculture) compared with 4.7 per cent in Japan and 4.3 per
cent in Germany.
How much de-regulation to improve standards is achievable without upsetting
the delicate ethnic balance which underpins the country's stability? The
answer appears to be quite a lot. The prime minister, Dr Mahathir Mohamad,
has relaxed the rules on using English, encouraged 'twinning' with Western
universities, and promoted a big expansion in private colleges.
More broadly, the government machine, like the Singaporean machine 15 years
ago, is starting to focus single-mindedly on the transition to a high
value-added economy. Mr Lay Ah Oon, of the Malaysia Industrial Development
Authority, says that labour intensive projects from foreign investors are
now being turned away, some companies are even being encouraged to relocate
in Thailand or China, and there is much greater emphasis on high local
content.
This policy emphasis is already making a mark. For every MDollars 1m of
investment approved by MIDA last year seven jobs were generated compared
with 14 jobs in 1989. There is some patchy evidence of more sophisticated
manufacturing techniques and more research and development being done in
Malaysia, backed by generous R&amp;D grants and tax breaks.
To improve vocational and technical training a levy system was established
last year under which all manufacturing companies with more than 50
employees have to pay 1 per cent of their wage bill to the Human Resource
Development Fund (a total of MDollars 61m last year) which then subsidises
in-company training. Also, the government plans to build a further seven
polytechnics by the year 2000 and is aiming to double to 8,000 the number of
annual science and technology graduates.
Even before it starts producing the workers required by a high value-added
economy, Malaysia will remain more attractive than the pessimists concede.
Labour may be more expensive than some other countries in the region but
Malaysia has reasonable infrastructure, good basic education and widespread
use of English. Nonetheless, even some of the optimists concede that its
slow recognition of the need to upgrade means that the country still faces a
difficult decade of transition.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Survey of Malaysia (11): Islam and gigabytes - US disk-maker
Komag's Penang operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Penang, one feature immediately strikes the visitor - a state of the art
electronics plant with a Moslem prayer room.
It would be hard to find a better symbol in Malaysia of the successful
marriage of Islam with modernity and the market, the idea that inspires the
prime minister, Dr Mahathir Mohamad.
It would also be hard to find a better example of the kind of manufacturing
plant which Malaysia desperately requires more of, as it attempts to shift
from labour intensive to high value-added production.
Komag, the US based advanced disk manufacturer, says its Penang plant is the
lowest cost disk producer in the world.
For Malaysia it certainly sets new standards of technological sophistication
in clean room technology and automation. The plant, which is more like a
hospital than a factory with busy people hurrying about in surgeon-like
uniforms, currently produces about 20,000 1-gigabyte disk drives per day.
The value-added contrast with its next door neighbour, a textile plant owned
by Eastern Knitters, could not be more striking. Eastern employs 4,000
people to generate annual sales of MDollars 50m; Komag employs 600 people to
produce annual sales of MDollars 270m.
Even within the electronics sector Komag is rare. Most of Penang's
electronic companies import products which have had 60 to 70 per cent of the
value added already in Japan or US, with the Malaysians merely finishing and
testing. Komag, on the other hand, takes a piece of aluminium with a hole in
the middle costing about USDollars 1.40 and, after processing it, sells it
for about USDollars 10.
The managerial brains behind the plant is a typical product of Malaysia's
cosmopolitan elite.
Mr Thian Hoo Tan, 46, worked in the US for 18 years before returning to
Malaysia to manage the plant. Before that he was at the University of
Malaysia where he roomed with several people who are now in the cabinet or
chief ministers of Malaysian states. 'I used to share a room with Anwar
Ibrahim (now the deputy prime minister) when he was a hot headed left-wing
nationalist. We used to go on demonstrations together,' recalls Mr Tan.
While such connections can do no harm, the main reason Komag chose to locate
in Penang is the presence of so many customers including Seagate, Western
Digital, Hewlett Packard and Conner.
'When we were setting up the plant (which opened in early 1992) I made
several good decision and one bad one,' recalls Mr Tan. The bad decision was
to believe the Penang authorities when they said they could guarantee
uninterrupted electricity supply. The capital and energy intensive Komag
plant consumes about 5 per cent of the island's power and is badly hit by
the regular power cuts. 'We usually have two or three small power cuts each
month, which costs us about USDollars 100,000, then every now and then we
have a big one which costs more like USDollars 500,000,' he says.
The best decision of all was to scrap the normal job categorisation for such
a plant which starts with a low wage operator and moves up through engineers
and technicians to supervisors.
Mr Tan created instead 'higher value-added jobs', a manual worker/technician
grade and an engineer/supervisor grade.
'The manual technicians have to be able to understand some physics and
chemistry as well as work with their hands. When recruiting we put people
through four to five hours of stringent verbal and practical tests and only
hired 9 out of every 100,' he says.
'This was a big gamble but it has paid off, and because the workers
understand what they are doing they can use their creativity to improve the
process,' he adds.
They are paid well above normal rates. A manual technician receives about
MDollars 900 basic per month but with fringe benefits and social security
costs Komag about MDollars 1700 per month.
Mr Tan says that real wage costs are rising at over 10 per cent per year,
and effectively doubling every five years. Employees also benefit from a
company-wide profit-sharing scheme which hands out 9 per cent of world-wide
profits. The result is that the young technicians - average age is only
about 25 - remain unusually loyal to the company.
'We have been fabulously successful. We erased our accumulated deficit as
early as April 1993 and we were making money one and a half years ahead of
schedule,' he says. Komag, believes Mr Tan, represents the manufacturing
future for Penang and Malaysia. 'As wage costs surge more and more simple
assembly operations are planning to move out. I know of at least four
companies which have drawn up plans for re-location,' he says.
But he warns that Malaysia does not, currently, have the human resources to
replicate the Komag model on a wider scale. At national level he thinks that
the practice of encouraging 'twinning' with colleges from Australia or
America is not working because too many people are doing the 'wrong'
subjects like management and accounting and not enough are doing technical
and science subjects.
'Don't forget when we were recruiting we employed only 9 out of 100
applicants; this country has got to work on the other 91,' says Mr Tan.
Through the Penang Skill Development Centre the company is helping to raise
the general pool of vocational skills in the area.
In a few months Komag will be drawing on that pool. The 220,000 sq feet of
plant is being supplemented by another unit of 130,000 sq feet, and the
number of lines will grow from three to seven. It is the answer to Dr
Mahathir's prayers.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Survey of Malaysia (9): A consensus born of progress - The
political arena is quiet, but not as somnolent as it appears
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Malaysia prides itself on its political stability. the national front,
composed of parties representing the country's various racial groups but
dominated by the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), has governed
since independence from British rule in 1957.
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, prime minister and UMNO president, has been in power
since 1981. Dr Mahathir influences virtually every aspect of Malaysian life.
Not only is the 67 year-old prime minister seen as the main architect of the
country's soaring economic growth. The government's hold over the media
ensures that Dr Mahathir's views on a range of issues - from moral decay and
economic decline in the west to religious correctness at home - are
constantly emphasised.
Economic success has brought about a large degree of political complacency.
Constitutional amendments which again strengthened the powers of the
executive at the expense of the judiciary were rushed through parliament
earlier this year with scarcely a whimper of public dissent. The political
opposition is weak and divided. General elections are likely to be held
either later this year or early next. UMNO seems certain to maintain its
firm grip.
Lift up the political carpet and things are not quite so orderly. The main
points of conflict are found not between the country's various political
parties but within UMNO itself. Since the party of the majority Malays
controls virtually all positions of power, any internal upheaval is likely
to have profound consequences for the country's future.
In UMNO elections late last year Mr Anwar Ibrahim, the 47 year-old finance
minister, was declared party deputy president. Subsequently Mr Anwar was
appointed deputy prime minister - and the most likely heirto the Mahathir
mantle.
Three of Mr Anwar's supporters, all in their 40s, were promoted to leading
UMNO positions in the party elections. The old guard, represented by Mr
Ghafar Baba, Mr Anwar's rival for the UMNO post, was unceremoniously pushed
aside.
Suave and urbane, his conversation peppered with literary and scholastic
references, Mr Anwar is said to represent the Malay baru, or new Malay -
modern in outlook, a man capable of carrying through the ambitious Mahathir
vision of making Malaysia a fully industrialised nation by the year 2020.
At times the Mahathir/Anwar duo seems to be a carefully balanced alliance.
At other times their opinions seem to conflict. Dr Mahathir emphasises
economic goals, constantly urging Malaysians to work toward achieving higher
growth figures. Mr Anwar warns that people must not be obsessed with
material growth and must set more time aside for intellectual pursuits.
Dr Mahathir rails against the west and boasts of the region's achievements.
Mr Anwar cautions Asians not to be arrogant or to be blind to problems in
their own societies.
Mr Anwar firmly denies that there are any political problems between himself
and the prime minister. Yet analysts feel that tensions are inevitable
between the ambitious younger politician and an elder leader who seems to
have no wish to retire.
Allied to this are the increasingly visible strains that have developed
between Mr Anwar and Mr Daim Zainuddin, a close confidant of Dr Mahathir and
a considerable power behind the scenes. Mr Daim is a former finance minister
and functions as a special economic adviser to the government as well as
UMNO treasurer.
As Dr Mahathir's trusted lieutenant in the 1980s, Mr Daim helped rebuild
UMNO finances after a damaging party split. Mr Daim is a corporate wheeler
dealer who has backed the rise of several Malay businessmen. Political
analysts say Mr Anwar has become angry with Mr Daim's attempts to influence
government and so promote the interests of his business associates. Yet as
long as Mr Daim has the ear of Dr Mahathir, Mr Anwar can take little action.
While UMNO's top echelon worries about personalities, the rank and file has
been voicing growing concern about corruption within the party and a
nationwide cult of vote buying and so called 'money politics'. The party
fears the alienation of a wide section of the public from the political
process. In June, UMNO held a special convention to discuss such matters.
'If we accept money politics in the party, if corruption becomes a culture
in UMNO, if our leaders gain positions through bribery, we will have a
government that is filled with and led by corrupt criminals,' Dr Mahathir
told delegates. The convention agreed that in future any member involved in
money politics would face expulsion from the party.
Stamping out such abuses will be hard. Opposition politicians accuse UMNO
itself of making the most flagrant use of money in the election process.
Earlier this year Dr Mahathir's national front finally gained control of the
local administration in the east Malaysia state of Sabah. Sabah's former
rulers not only accused Dr Mahathir's administration of witholding much
needed development funds in an attempt to coerce people into voting for the
government party. They said the national front was buying votes to the
extent that it was 'dropping money out of helicopters'.
Other forms of money politics are deeply ingrained, mainly due to historical
factors. Traditionally Malaysia's Chinese community, which makes up about 35
per cent of the population, has controlled much of the country's economy. In
the early 1970s the government launched its New Economic Policy (NEP),
designed to give 'bumiputra', or indigenous Malays, a greater share in the
country's wealth.
Malays were favoured in government jobs, in education and in business. Under
a wide ranging privatisation programme which got underway in the late 1980s
Malays were granted preferential and highly profitable share allocations.
UMNO itself became directly involved in the private sector, controlling a
complex web of businesses stretching into most areas of the economy. A new
corporate elite emerged, buttressed by close ties to leading politicians.
Mr Daim insists that since a reorganisation of UMNO finances in 1988, the
party has not had any business interests. Mr Terence Gomez, a Malaysian
academic who has made an extensive study of UMNO's corporate investments,
says that while UMNO may no longer have direct control of companies, the
connections are still there.
'A stage has been reached when a business elite, made up of bumiputras and
their Chinese partners and with close connections to leading politicians, is
able to dominate a large segment of corporate life. It can also seriously
influence stock market activity.'
The close ties between the business world and leading politicians make it
difficult to put a stop to money politics. Such ties also cause resentment
among UMNO members who feel the party has lost its way. They feel decisions
are made by an urban based, wealthy group with little commitment to the lot
of the Malay community.
Dr Mahathir's position is secure. But with his party undergoing a crisis of
identity, there could be plenty of political fireworks ahead.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Survey of Malaysia (8): Pique, pride and pragmatism - The
impact of the trade measures against UK and Australia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has not been a good year for British/Malaysia relations. Then again
Britain has not been the only one on Kuala Lumpur's blacklist: Australia
also has problems.
Businesspeople have come to realise the considerable opportunities in
catering to the needs of such a fast growing and ambitious country as
Malaysia. They have also had to grow used to the risks involved in dealing
with a government which is often extremely sensitive to outside opinions or
criticism.
For Britain, the trouble started with the controversy in London over the
granting of a Pounds 234m aid package to Malaysia for the building of the
Pergau dam and its linkage to a 1988 Pounds 1bn defence contract signed
between the then British prime minister, Mrs Margaret Thatcher, and Dr
Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister. Malaysian officials angrily
rejected allegations that the Pergau project was an unsound one or that it
was too expensive.
On top of this came an allegation in a British newspaper that a British
company had tried to offer bribes to Dr Mahathir. Though the newspaper did
not allege that Dr Mahathir had accepted bribes or had been involved, the
prime minister interpreted it in broader terms - a personal insult and an
attempt to undermine the integrity of Malaysia's leadership.
'We believe the foreign media must learn the fact that many developing
countries, including a country led by a brown Moslem, have the ability to
manage their own affairs successfully,' said a government statement at the
end of February.
As punishment for the actions of the British press, Kuala Lumpur imposed a
ban on giving government contracts to British companies. Malaysia clearly
felt that the British government had the power to censure the press. The
official British reaction to the ban only seemed to add to the confusion: on
the one hand, Mr Major described the Malaysian action as being 'not remotely
justified': on the other, Mr Major's ministers - in public at least  -
joined with the massed ranks of British business in laying the blame for the
Malaysian action squarely on the British media.
There have been some perplexing aspects to the ban. From the beginning it
has been difficult to gauge exactly what Malaysia has wanted in order for
the ban to be lifted. 'All I want is the truth,' said Dr Mahathir. 'But then
the British media is incapable of telling the truth.'
The Malaysian government insisted the ban only applied to public sector
contracts. But the line between the public and private sector in Malaysia is
blurred. Arbitrary rulings have been made on who is and who is not affected
by the ban. Some British companies have found they have lost contracts with
Tenaga Nasional, the semi privatised electricity utility. Others have
continued to work with Petronas, the state oil and gas conglomerate.
For British companies the main casualty of the ban has been work on a new
international airport being built south of Kuala Lumpur - at present
southeast Asia's biggest infrastructure project with a price tag of between
MDollars 9bn and MDollars 12bn. An Anglo Japanese consortium which included
Balfour Beatty, GEC and Trafalgar House, charged with managing the project,
has now been disbanded and several years of preparatory work has been
aborted.
However, British/Malaysia trade has not been reduced. Rather the reverse.
Britain's exports to Malaysia went up by more than 80 per cent in the first
six months of 1994 to Pounds 666m while Malaysia's exports to Britain
dropped 24 per cent to Pounds 581m. Ironically, part of the reason for the
increase in Britain's exports to Malaysia is thought to be the delivery of
defence equipment associated with the controversial 1988 defence deal
between the two countries.
Australia's problems with Malaysia began after Dr Mahathir decided not to
attend a meeting of leaders of the Asia Pacific held in Seattle late last
year. In an off the cuff remark to reporters, Mr Paul Keating, Australia's
prime minister, described Dr Mahathir as a recalcitrant for his non
attendance.
The dark clouds of Dr Mahathir's anger burst, not for the first time, on
Australia. Various retaliatory actions were threatened. Australian business
was warned that it could lose contracts. A great deal of diplomacy was
needed before relations improved.
Recently both countries have been in trouble again with Kuala Lumpur. The
Malaysian leadership objected to British press reports concerning alleged
illegal banking payments in Malaysia. Kuala Lumpur has reacted angrily to
remarks made by Mr Keating about Malaysian logging companies practising
'environmental piracy' in the South Pacific.
Dr Mahathir has always put himself forward as an economic pragmatist. 'I'm
sometimes nasty to government, never to businesspeople,' he said earlier
this year. However, there are those who feel that Malaysia's actions have
done it more harm than good. The country is still dependent for its growth
on outside investment and technology. Business does not take kindly to being
used as a punch bag in arguments it has no part in.
There have been rumours that the British ban will be lifted soon. However,
no one is holding his breath. In 1981 Dr Mahathir, piqued at what he
perceived to be British highhandedness on issues ranging from trade to high
fees for Malaysian students in Britain, instituted a 'Buy British Last'
policy.
It took several years of careful diplomacy in order for that directive to be
changed.

FT  30 AUG 94 / International Company News: Little reward for a Digital Risc
 -US group's link with Olivetti has come unravelled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Digital Equipment's decision to sell its 7.9 per cent stake in Olivetti of
Italy at a heavy loss should not have come as much of a surprise.
Apart from the US company's pressing need to restructure its investment
portfolio, the shareholding was the last tangible evidence of a strategy
which has failed to work for either company.
Digital, once the world's second largest computer manufacturer but now
losing money heavily, took an initial 4 per cent stake in Olivetti in 1992
as part of a complex deal designed to give Digital a broader market for its
products and provide the Italian company with a financial and technical
lifeline. It subsequently increased its holding to 7.9 per cent.
Digital first bought 20m Olivetti shares at a premium to the market price in
June 1992, and then increased its stake gradually with further market
purchases, for a total of Dollars 287.8m.
Digital has not specified the price at which the shares were sold during
late July and August, although it has had to write down a large part of the
investment. Wall Street analysts estimate that the sale of the stake would
have raised between Dollars 140m and Dollars 150m.
Two years on, it is clear that neither objective has come close to being
achieved. There were warning signs that the match was far from ideal.
Digital paid more than twice the market price for a share of a troubled
company whose hopes of returning to profitability were not bright. Olivetti
lost Dollars 297.5m in 1993, and is still struggling.
Why? Both companies talk about the broad benefits of a technological and
commercial alliance, but the deal was mostly about a single technology -
Digital's Alpha microprocessor, claimed to be the world's fastest.
The computer industry is changing dramatically. It is moving from
mainframe-based systems to new designs based on networks of personal
computers and mid-range machines called 'servers', which offer better price
performance.
The heart of these new client-server networks is a kind of microprocessor,
known as reduced instruction set computing (Risc), which is simple and very
fast.
All the large manufacturers are trying to establish their Risc
microprocessor as the standard. For this they need volume sales and have
therefore sought alliances with other manufacturers.
Sun Microsystems, a leader in Risc technology, has openly licensed its Sparc
designs and has an alliance in Europe with ICL, the UK-based company owned
by Fujitsu of Japan.
IBM, Motorola and Apple Computer are jointly developing the PowerPC, and IBM
has underlined a sales agreement with Groupe Bull of France by taking an
equity stake in the company.
Digital's stake in Olivetti had the same objective. Sales of Alpha
technology have not so far met expectations, although Digital says it is
beginning to see real growth with some Dollars 1bn worth of Alpha systems
sold.
Last quarter, it said, sales of Alpha technology outsold its older
minicomputer technology and now contribute 39 per cent of its computer
systems revenues. Olivetti has not made much of a contribution, however.
Although it introduced some Alpha-based workstations and servers in June,
analysts reckon that it has sold only a few tens of millions of dollars
worth of these systems to date.
In Olivetti's defence, analysts say that Digital has failed to establish
Alpha as an industry standard, and that it has not become a reference point
in the Risc market.
More significant, they point out that Olivetti's chief interest in Alpha was
to become the heart of its personal computers. Olivetti is the largest maker
of PCs in Europe. Digital, however, has decided to use Alpha to power its
network servers rather than PCs.
Both companies have dragged their feet in the market place. Digital has been
slow in delivering essential software while Olivetti discovered that moving
its existing customers to Alpha technology would take longer than it had
anticipated.
What is left of the alliance? As things stand, Digital will continue to buy
from Olivetti laser printers, where the Italian company has developed
first-rate technology. It will also continue to be Digital's principal
supplier of laptop computers.
Digital no longer relies on Olivetti for PCs for the European market,
although it will continue to buy the Italian machines in small numbers. The
two companies have pledged to work together on PC technology.
Digital also points out that Olivetti has launched products based on Alpha
technology, although it agrees that sales, at an early stage in the product
cycle, are insignificant.
Digital has substantial cash, inherited from its successful years in the
late 1980s. Does it need to raise more money?
Probably not in absolute terms, although it still has substantial
restructuring charges to meet. But its senior executives have to be seen as
putting their house in order.
Talks with Oracle Systems, a database company, about the sale of Digital's
database software, are thought to be close to a conclusion. The sale might
raise a further Dollars 100m or so.
What effect will the loss of Digital as an equity partner have on Olivetti?
It says it is not looking for a single large partner but is prepared to
consider several smaller alliances in areas, such as telecommunications and
multimedia which it has identified as its best opportunities.
The Digital-Olivetti deal is the first of the Risc alliances to come
unravelled. It remains to be seen whether the others will prove more stable.

FT  30 AUG 94 / International Company News: Underlying improvement at NCC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong upturn in underlying performance was yesterday reported by NCC,
Sweden's second-largest construction group, even though conditions in its
home market continued to worsen.
The group relied on reorganisation, lower financial costs and a better
investment performance for the improvement.
Headline profit declined to SKr130m (Dollars 16.9m) in the first six months
from SKr303m, but both figures were distorted by one-off gains from share
sales. Excluding these, the group swung from a SKr170m loss to a SKr106m
profit.
Reflecting the continuing depression in the Swedish market, revenues slipped
to SKr7.6bn from SKr8.6bn while the order intake was unchanged at SKr6.7bn.
NCC said industry estimates showed the market would shrink by a further 13
per cent this year before making a modest recovery in 1995. New housing
starts fell 40 per cent in the first half to just 3,300 units.
The group expects to remain in the black for the full year after last year's
SKr175m profit. Lower profits from its three building units are expected to
be offset by a stronger performance from NCC Invest and reduced losses in
NCC Real Estate.
Euroc, the cement and building materials group, saw a sharp increase in
first-half profits to SKr258m from SKr95m, after shrugging off a continued
downturn in its two most important markets, Finland and Sweden.
The company said synergies from its acquisition of two Finnish companies at
the end of last year increased productivity, and better market conditions in
the US and the UK contributed to the improvement.
It predicted a full-year profit of at least SKr650m, well ahead of last
year's SKr240m. The estimate comprises a SKr470m underlying profit and a
further SKr180m in one-off gains.
During the second half, a SKr460m dividend from the winding up of the
Protorp investment group will be partly counterbalanced by SKr280m in
writedowns, it said.

FT  30 AUG 94 / International Company News: AssiDoman lifts year's forecast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AssiDoman, the Swedish forestry group partly privatised earlier this year,
yesterday raised its forecast for full-year profits after reporting a 77 per
cent rise in pre-tax profits in the first half.
The group, Sweden's fourth largest forestry concern, said profits after
financial items rose to SKr809m (Dollars 105.3m) from a pro-forma SKr457m in
the same period last year, due to an 11 per cent increase in sales to
SKr8.16bn from SKr7.38bn and a fall in financial charges to SKr90m from
SKr142m.
Mr Lennart Ahlgren, chief executive, said if production conditions remained
stable, the full-year profit after financial items was expected to reach
between SKr1.6bn and SKr1.8bn. This compares with a forecast made in the
February privatisation prospectus of between SKr1.2bn and SKr1.5bn. The
company was formed before the sell-off by a merger of Assi and Doman and
later took over a third majority state-owned concern, NCB.
NCB results were consolidated in the latest figures. A total of 49 per cent
the whole new group was sold off, raising SKr7.6bn in Sweden's biggest
privatisation.
AssiDoman benefited from higher sale prices for sawn timber and pulp. Its
forest and timber products division lifted sales to SKr2.5bn from SKr2.1bn,
and operating profits to SKr694m from SKr435m.

The turmoil in international bond markets had a dramatic impact on the
first-half results of Skandia, the Swedish insurer.
The group slumped to a SKr2.40bn (Dollars 322.9m) loss from a SKr1.66bn
profit at the management operating level under the impact of unrealised
losses on its bond portfolio.
It still recorded a deficit of SKr550m - against a SKr1.16bn profit  - even
if unrealised changes to bond values are excluded. This is because of
realised capital losses on bond sales, changes in share values and changes
in exchange rates for surplus values of assets.
The group's operating performance was also affected. Before adjusting the
value of its bonds to the lower of cost or market value, profit fell to
SKr529m from SKr572m. After adjusting, it swung to an operating loss of
SKr435m from a SKr637m profit.
Mr Bjorn Wolrath, chief executive, said the group was consoled by the
improvement in its core insurance operations where profits climbed 31 per
cent to SKr378m.
Reinsurance activities improved their results and there was a strong
improvement at NIG Skandia, a UK unit.
Premium income climbed 35 per cent to SKr27.3bn, driven by a strong
expansion of unit-linked life assurance business.
Skandia triggered turmoil in Sweden's financial markets in July when it
boycotted new Swedish bond issues in protest at a lack of political will to
curb state debt. The boycott remains in force. The group said it had no
Swedish bonds in its portfolio at mid-year.
Net asset value per share was SKr150 at the end of June, against SKr179 on
January 1. The group's solvency margin improved to 83 per cent from 60 per
cent.

Naf Naf, the French textiles group, last night announced it had agreed terms
to acquire Chevignon, the leisurewear company, for FFr125m (Dollars 23.32m).
Negotiations between Naf Naf and Chevignon, two of the best-known brand
names in the French clothing industry, have been going on for some months.
Mr Patrick Pariente, one of the two brothers that head Naf Naf, last week
confirmed reports of an imminent deal but waited until yesterday's
shareholders' meeting to announce the terms of the transaction.
Naf Naf, which emerged as a force in the French textiles industry during the
1970s and 1980s, went public last year.
The acquisition of Chevignon, which is a force in the jeans market,
represents an important opportunity to expand its interests.
Mr Pariente affirmed that Naf Naf was on course for growth this year with
estimated net profits of between FFr135m and FFr155m.
Far Eastern Textile, one of Taiwan's leading manufacturers of textiles and
other related products, posted pre-tax profits of NTDollars 918m (USDollars
35m) in the year to June 30, against NTDollars 621m a year earlier, writes
Laura Tyson in Taipei.
Revenues climbed to NTDollars 11.4bn from NTDollars 9.8bn.

Coca-Cola and Nestle are streamlining their global co-operation in the
ready-to-drink tea and coffee sector.
The two groups will dissolve a joint venture created in 1991 to make and
sell the products throughout the world. Instead, the two will work together
to accelerate their product drive in more countries.
Ready-to-drink teas and coffees, distributed hot and cold in vending
machines, have long been popular in Japan, the only country where Nestle and
Coca-Cola compete with each other in these products.
The two groups have decided to combine their strengths - Nestle's coffee and
tea brands and Coke's distribution and vending machines - to introduce the
range to other markets.
Nestle said yesterday the joint venture had so far introduced ready-to-drink
teas and coffees to 25 countries on four continents. Neither company has
revealed sales figures, but it is believed the venture has annual revenues
of about Dollars 250m.
Under the new arrangement, Coke will concentrate on developing the market
for ready-to-drink teas, and will take out a 100-year licence from Nestle to
use the Nestea trademark throughout the world, except in Japan.
Nestle will concentrate on developing Nescafe brand ready-to-drink coffees.
Wherever possible, the products would be distributed through Coca-Cola
bottlers.
Nestle said the arrangement would accelerate decision-making by eliminating
an entire level of management.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Survey of Malaysia (7): For Proton, a brother - The motor
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Malaysia's car industry is a symbol of the country's ambition to join the
league of developed nations. It is also the foundation of the country's
industrialisation programme, writes Kieran Cooke.
The first car to be manufactured in Malaysia, the Proton, rolled off the
assembly line in 1985. Last year Proton produced a record 116,611 cars at
its plant outside Kuala Lumpur. The Proton, made in co-operation with
Mitsubishi of Japan, now has a a more than 70 per cent share of the domestic
car market.
Last year more than 17,000 Protons were exported - the bulk of them to
Britain. Proton is now making plans for marketing a left hand drive version
of its cars in continental Europe. It is also expanding its presence in the
region: more than 2,000 Protons are likely to be exported to Indonesia over
the next year in exchange for Malaysian purchases of Indonesian made
aircraft.
Plans are well advanced for a joint venture Proton assembly plant in the
Philippines. Malaysia and Vietnam have signed preliminary agreements for
cooperation in setting up a Vietnamese car industry. In May, Malaysia, Japan
and China signed a memorandum of understanding for the manufacture and
distribution of car components in China.
Encouraged by the success of Proton, Malaysia is now embarking on its second
national car project. In July this year Perusahaan Otomobil Kedua, or
Perodua, rolled out its first four seater 660cc passenger car. The Kancil,
or Mouse Deer, is being produced in co-operation with Daihatsu and is
modelled on the Japanese group's Mira car.
Perodua says that 100 Kancils per day will be produced by the end of the
year: production will eventually rise to 45,000 annually. There are plans to
export the Kancil in the near future.
From the beginning, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, has been
the driving force behind the growth of the country's car industry. Dr
Mahathir sees the car sector as the catalyst for industrialisation:
industries will grow to service the car sector and eventually diversify into
other activities.
This has been happening. More than 70 per cent of the Proton is now sourced
in Malaysia. In an important step toward more self sufficiency Proton is now
beginning to cast its own engine blocks. A widespread network of industries
and vendors have become involved in the car manufacturing process.
However the Proton's core technology and high value items, including much of
the transmission system, are still imported from Japan. Dr Mahathir has
criticised the Japanese for not transferring technology fast enough.
'We have to learn from the Japanese,' says Dr Mahathir. 'But at the end of
the day we have to be independent, in the sense that we can develop our own
car. We have to try to get the technology from somewhere, somehow ..the
Japanese step by step philosophy is fine, but the steps are being taken too
slowly.' The Japanese say that Malaysia still lacks some essential skills
and must invest more in training and R&amp;D.
The formation of a national car industry has been a costly exercise with
millions of dollars of public funds poured into Proton. Despite a 35 per
cent increase in turnover last year Proton's pre tax profits dropped 9.3 per
cent to MDollars 282m. Much of the profit drop was attributed to the rise in
the value of the yen and the consequent increase in import costs.
Mr Nadzmi Mohamed Salleh, a Malaysian who last year replaced a Mitsubishi
executive as Proton's managing director, says that Proton does not have
sufficient economies of scale to make 100 per cent local content a realistic
proposition. 'The costs would be too high,' says Mr Nadzmi. 'Instead Proton
may well opt for global sourcing.'
That appears to be already under way. In mid year Dr Mahathir made a trip to
the Peugeot Citroen works in France. Latest reports are that Citroen will
soon begin supplying engines for a variation of the Proton.
Proton is believed to have also investigated parts supply from Mercedes Benz
in Germany and General Motors and Ford in the US. Rover was also apparently
thought of as a supplier but dropped due to the ban on giving government
contracts to UK companies.
Some feel that Malaysia is being overly ambitious in embarking on a second
car project. Part of Proton's success in the domestic market has been due to
high duties placed on the import of other cars. The new Kancil will be
considerably cheaper than the Proton and Malaysia's premier car maker could
see its market share decline.
Proton admits that with the domestic market at near saturation point, it has
to export to survive. However, Proton's Japanese partners are unhappy at the
prospect of the Malaysian car competing with their own makes in markets such
as Indonesia.
In Britain, one of the main attractions of the Proton is its price. The UK
prices of Protons start at about MDollars 27,600 (Pounds 6,990). In Malaysia
the cheapest Proton costs more than MDollars 30,000. Under the European
Community's generalised system of preferences (Gsp), Proton has full
exemption from UK import duties. Continued Gsp exemption is vital for UK
sales.
If Proton starts making significant inroads into the car market on the
continent, Europe's motor manufacturers might argue for a revision of
Malaysia's Gsp status or demand the removal of Malaysia's protective import
duties.
Malaysia's car industry has travelled a long way in the last 10 years.
Progress could be slower in the years ahead.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Survey of Malaysia (6): Compliant workforce - Why trade
unions are not more militant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Malaysia's trade unions ought to be flourishing. The country has full
employment and rising wages, and the unions are freer than in most countries
in the region. But the leaders of the the main union centre - the Malaysian
Trade Union Congress - are subdued.
'Things here are not as bad as in many countries, we have semi-free trade
unionism,' concedes Mr G Rajasekaran, MTUC secretary general. Union
membership has even been rising, especially in the manufacturing sector, but
it is not keeping pace with the growth in employment and has fallen sharply
in the traditional stronghold of the rubber plantations.
Including members of the two smaller union centres, the Malaysian Labour
Organisation (led by the main bank employees union) and CUEPACS,
representing public sector workers, there are about 700,000 trade union
members in Malaysia. That means about 15 per cent of the eligible workforce
is organised.
'We are doing better than some countries like the US, but we are not happy
with our performance and we should do better,' says Mr Rajasekaran. One of
the biggest problems for the unions is the growth of immigrant labour -
mainly from Indonesia and Bangladesh. Immigrants have caused a big drop in
union membership in construction and the plantations, where they are often
paid at lower rates than Malaysian workers.
How much the low membership is also the result of government restrictions is
hard to judge. Mr Gordon McColl, in the Singapore office of the
International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, reckons that the MTUC
would double its membership from 400,000 to 800,000 if it faced no
restrictions.
The government believes in consensus around its own model of 'guided'
politics and economics and makes no secret of its dislike for adversarial
trade unionism. Government ministers labelled union leaders 'traitors' when
they supported the call in international forums for minimum world labour
standards, an accusation that hurt.
Mr Anthony Yeo, secretary general of the Ministry of Human Resources, says
that complete freedom of association could add to costs 'because of
unscrupulous trade union activity'.
On paper the trade union recognition laws are liberal. If seven workers
petition for a union the Registrar of Trade Unions has to consider it, and
if 50 per cent plus one of the relevant employees of a company are members
of the union the employer has to recognise the union.
In practice, however, it is extremely difficult to form a new union and the
unions are engaged in a constant game of cat and mouse with the Registrar.
Applications are regularly turned down. The textile union wanted to organise
the Mattel plant which makes Barbie dolls, but was told it was a toy and not
a textile factory.
Similarly, when workers at a Kimberley-Clark factory wanted to join the
print and paper union the Registrar told them it was the wrong union but
refused to tell them which would be the right union saying it would be
'unethical' to do so.
Most controversially, the national unions are not allowed to organise in the
electronics sector, which employs nearly 200,000 people and is the fastest
growing sector. 'About 70 per cent of the workers are women and they tend to
be docile,' says Mr Abdul Razak Hamid, head of the textile union in Penang.
Mr Yeo defends the government's position: 'We believe that enterprise unions
are the most appropriate for this sector, although it may be that at some
point in the future we will adopt a different position.'
Mr P Arunasalam, general secretary of the electrical workers union, says
that most of the enterprise unions wither away after a while, and some
employers even prevent them getting started. But his biggest complaint is
that the definition of electronic is constantly shifting to include lots of
electrical workers who should be in his union.
If extending organisation is hard, going on strike is harder. Mr Hamid, of
the textile union, says: 'We can go on strike, but then again we can't' The
last proper strike in his sector was in 1976.
The law can require compulsory arbitration instead of a strike and there is
no right of appeal. In practice that means no strikes. The closest union
members get to industrial action is picketing in their lunch breaks.
Recently, for example, employees at Unilever in Kuala Lumpur started a
lunch-time picketing campaign after a 9 per cent pay claim was rejected.
The union leaders do not deny that wages and working conditions have been
improving. But they are caught between claiming that wages have not been
rising as fast as the employers maintain and claiming credit for the rises
that have been achieved.
Mr Arunasalam says that wages have gone up 27 per cent over the past three
years in the electrical sector in factories covered by collective agreements
(which have built-in 10 per cent annual increments), compared with only 15
per cent in non-union plants.
Mr Rajasekeran believes, like the government, that wages should rise in line
with productivity but claims that many workers have been getting reasonable
rises only by working excessive overtime and points to the much higher basic
wages in Singapore.
And Mr N Balakrishnan, an official of the electrical union in Penang, takes
issue with the World Bank figures which show average per capita income at
around USDollars 3,000 and says that 70 per cent of workers earn less than
USDollars 2,000.
But Mr Balakrishnan sounds dispirited. 'Consumer culture is now such a big
thing, workers are just interested in working and spending, they are not
interested in union activism,' he says.
Workers in unionised plants have better job security. But Malaysia does not
have a hire and fire industrial culture and employment rights and health and
safety regulation are both reasonably good, at least on paper. An economic
downturn might help improve the standing of the unions, but the union
leaders fear that any success would bring with it even tighter restrictions.

FT  30 AUG 94 / International Company News: Bayer to pursue control of US
brand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's Bayer group is to press on with its bid to regain control of the
Bayer brand in the US, in spite of yesterday's takeover of Sterling
Winthrop, which owns American rights to the name and the cross-shaped
trademark.
The company said yesterday it would seek 'clarification' from the new owner,
SmithKline Beecham of the UK, which has agreed to pay Kodak Dollars 2.93bn
cash for its Sterling self-medication subsidiary.
Bayer, which had also bid, said it was still interested in 'parts' of
Sterling's over-the-counter business in the US, and wanted to discuss the
issue of trademark rights.
One of the main attractions is the branded aspirin business (the analgesic
was invented by Bayer), which generates sales of Dollars 150m a year in the
US.
Mr Manfred Schneider, the German group's chairman, has said in the past he
would swim the Atlantic if it could win him back the rights requisitioned
and auctioned by the US government along with the Bayer business during the
first world war.
However, signs of a tough auction emerged earlier this month, when Mr
Schneider said he would pay only a limited premium for the Sterling
operations. 'We do not absolutely need the trademark,' he said then.
Win or lose, the company said expansion of its non-prescription medicines
remained a priority, especially in the US. It is currently represented there
by Miles, based in Pittsburgh, which last year had sales of Dollars 6.5bn.
According to Fortune magazine, Miles is the 84th biggest industrial company
in the US.
Bayer extended its reach in the US market earlier this year when it paid
Dollars 310m for a minority stake in Schein Pharmaceutical, a
privately-owned generic drug specialist. Generics - or out-of-patent
products - represent one of the fastest growing segments in pharmaceutical
markets.

FT  30 AUG 94 / International Company News: Turnround at Kugelfischer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FAG Kugelfischer, the German ball-bearing group which underwent a rigorous
shake-up last year, rolled back to profit in the six months to the end of
June.
Operating income of DM49m (Dollars 30.2m) contrasted with a loss at this
level of DM109m last time. Net earnings were DM17m compared with a deficit
of DM104m.
The group said yesterday it expected a positive result for the full year, as
long as markets did not deteriorate, and for sales to increase on a
like-for-like basis.
The return to the black was due largely to reduced interest payments and
payroll costs. Bank debt at the end of June had been reduced to DM1bn
compared with DM1.84bn, while reducing the workforce by 40 per cent had cut
the wages bill by 34 per cent.
Meanwhile, operations also benefited from the international economic
recovery. FAG booked new orders in the review period worth DM1.44bn, an
increase of 23 per cent. On July 1 it had orders on hand for almost 4 1/2
months' work.
Group sales in the first half were up 1 per cent on a comparable basis, at
DM1.32bn.
The company has benefited from the international recovery, especially in the
automotive and machinery sectors.
FAG had almost been given up for lost two years ago, before Mr Kajo
Neukirchen, a renowned turnround specialist, was appointed chairman of the
supervisory board. His job was to oversee a shake-up involving closures,
sales and massive job losses.
From 30,000 at the start of 1993, when he took office, the group workforce
had been cut to 15,400 at the end of June. In the interim, Mr Neukirchen has
taken charge of the salvage operation at Metallgesellschaft, the German
engineering group that almost collapsed late last year.
As part of his plan, FAG has been split into four joint stock companies with
responsibilities for automotive components, aircraft and precision bearings,
trade and services.

FT  30 AUG 94 / International Company News: Banks spoil media man's appetite
 -Debts threaten Robert Hersant's paper empire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A succession of French governments has tried and failed to curb the power of
Mr Robert Hersant, the secretive media magnate who is the dominant force in
the French press. However, Mr Hersant is now under unprecedented pressure to
dismantle his empire - not from the government, but from his banks.
Mr Hersant, 74, is more accustomed to buying newspapers than selling them.
His appetite for acquisitions has earned him the nickname le papivore, the
'paper eater', in France. It has also created one of Europe's largest
newspaper groups including Le Figaro, the biggest-selling French national
daily; France-Soir, the sensationalist evening paper; a string of regional
titles; and significant press interests as far afield as Belgium, Poland,
Hungary, Tahiti and Guadelope.
However le papivore is heavily in debt. His main lender is Credit Lyonnais,
the ailing state-controlled bank which has made no secret of the fact that
it is pressing Mr Hersant to redeem some of his loans, just as it has been
pursuing Mr Bernard Tapie, the beleaguered left-wing entrepreneur, to repay
his debts.
Mr Hersant's refusal to publish accounts makes it impossible to gauge his
financial position. Analysts estimate he has total debts of around FFr4bn
(Dollars 719.4m). They calculate he is obliged to repay FFr1bn of it by the
end of this year, in one tranche of FFr600m in late October and another of
FFr400m at the end of December. Given that most of his titles are believed
to be in the red, and that Mr Hersant is known to be bitterly opposed to the
possibility of bringing in external investors, his only solution seems to be
disposals.
The Hersant group has no shortage of candidates for sale. Mr Hersant, the
self-made son of a merchant navy officer, has been expanding his empire
since he founded his first title, L'Auto-Journal, after the second world
war. L'Auto-Journal prospered in the buoyant economic climate of post-war
France and, by the late 1950s, Mr Hersant had hit the acquisition trail. A
series of deals culminated in the mid-1970s with the takeover of Le Figaro.
He owns roughly 35 per cent (in circulation terms) of the French newspaper
market and 40 per cent of the Polish press. Mr Hersant even boasted he had a
monopoly over the Tahitian national daily press until, earlier this month, a
rival was launched to compete against his two titles.
Analysts are wary of pinning precise valuations on the Hersant group. 'We
have absolutely no idea of its true value,' said Mr Jean-Laurent Nabet,
media analyst at Societe Generale in Paris. 'After all, we don't even know
the exact level of sales or debt.'
However, the consensus in financial circles is that Le Figaro alone is worth
around FFr2bn. The French regional titles (which include Le Progres, the
influential Lyon daily that has a higher circulation than Le Figaro) are
thought likely to fetch another FFr2bn. Mr Hersant could also expect to
raise between FFr400m and FFr500m from selling his papers in Poland.
This means he could comfortably repay all his debts simply by selling part
of his empire. Mr Hersant recently raised FFr204m by selling a bundle of
magazines - including L'Auto Journal, his first title  - to Emap, the UK
media group.
There is no shortage of suitors for his remaining interests. Hollinger, the
Canadian group headed by Mr Conrad Black, is said to have expressed interest
in a number of titles. The UK's Associated Newspapers is mooted as a
prospective buyer for the Polish titles. Le Figaro is rumoured to have
attracted a string of potential purchasers including Hollinger; Mr Jimmy
Goldsmith, the flamboyant financier; and a French consortium composed of the
LVMH luxury goods group, the Alcatel-Alsthom electronics concern and Havas,
the powerful media company.
Moreover, the climate in the French newspaper market is improving, enhancing
the prospects for disposals.
France's newspapers have had a tough time over the past two years, as the
recession triggered a sharp decline in circulation and advertising. But the
economy is recovering and the industry has stabilised. 'The worst is
definitely over,' said Societe Generale's Mr Nabet.
However, Mr Hersant shows no sign of being prepared to sell. He revels in
his role as a hands-on proprietor in the traditional mould. He does nothing
to disguise the imposition of his political views on his papers: Le Figaro
has been steered steadily to the right under his ownership.
He has also used his titles as a platform for his political career - in both
the French and European parliaments - and has long relished playing a
power-broker role in French politics.
Mr Hersant's response to the current crisis has been to tighten his grip on
his empire, rather than relax it. One of the first victims of the credit
crunch was Mr Philippe Villin, the high-flying 40-year-old who had been seen
as Mr Hersant's heir-apparent until he was fired two months ago as chairman
of of France-Soir. The septuagenarian Mr Hersant announced he was personally
taking charge.
However, pressure is mounting. The deadline for his FFr600m repayment is
only two months away. The Emap deal shows Mr Hersant will make disposals if
he has to.
Any future sales, however, are likely to be along similar lines, involving
relatively low-profile titles. Even the most optimistic of Le Figaro's
suitors have accepted that Mr Hersant will try to cling on to that paper at
least until after he has played the power broker again in next spring's
presidential elections.

FT  30 AUG 94 / International Company News: MAN upbeat in spite of 30% drop
in earnings

MAN, the engineering and commercial vehicles group, claimed yesterday to
have ridden out the recession, in spite of a 30 per cent drop, to DM160m
(Dollars 98.7m), in net earnings in the year to the end of June.
The recovery which took hold in the second half was continuing, and profits
were expected to rise in the current year, it said.
In keeping with the group policy of paying dividends in line with operating
results, the 1993-94 payout is to be cut to DM7 from DM8.50, the company
said.
A powerful recovery had set in after a weak first half in which
restructuring costs had compounded the effects of recession. Group sales
ended the year down 4 per cent at DM18bn, after being almost 8 per cent
lower at the halfway stage.
New orders rose 11 per cent in the review period. MAN attributed this to a
20 per cent surge in foreign demand, which more than offset a 3 per cent
fall in domestic bookings.
The group reported a 30 per cent increase in demand for printing machinery
during the year, while orders for machinery and plant rose 17 per cent. Even
commercial vehicles showed a 10 per cent improvement.
MAN started the new financial year with 5 per cent more orders on hand than
a year earlier, while the workforce was reduced 6 per cent to 57,000 in the
same period.
Job cuts affected all sectors except diesel engines. Commercial vehicles
shed 10 per cent of its workforce and the MAN Roland printing plant plant
subsidiary 9 per cent.

FT  30 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Taking an interest can be the best option -
A change in the banks' attitude to debt-for-equity swaps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Debt-for-equity swaps have always been a last resort for British lenders,
representing a fleeting hope of some future pay-back, when the alternative
is probably nothing.
However, the recovery of WPP Group, the advertising company, under its
debt-relieved structure has enabled its backers to take a Pounds 100m profit
from their shares, and has reminded banks of the potential benefits of
equity participation in an improving economic environment.
As Mr Richard Lovell, president of the Association of Property Bankers,
argues: 'The banks' attitude towards debt-for-equity swaps has been that
they are more likely to get their money out first in debt than in equity.
It's down to a business culture. They don't see themselves as the right
people to hold equity.'
Bankers claim, however, that this is already changing. Substantial
debt-for-equity swaps are being examined for Queen's Moat Hotels, Wembley,
Stanhope and Tiphook, for example, and the performance of WPP can only
provide encouragement.
There are a number of reasons for the change. The last-ditch alternative,
receivership, is an expensive option, and it can damage the value of
potentially saleable assets.
By comparison, a rising stock market, improving property valuations and low
interest rates, have meant that many corporate near fatalities have been
given the ability to survive.
Mr Derek Sachs, director of specialised lending services at Royal Bank of
Scotland, says: 'The first thing to do is see if they have a viable
business, regardless of the debt structure.'
The Royal Bank has set up a special unit to handle bad loans, and this has
spearheaded a large increase in the number of equity swaps undertaken by the
bank.
In 1992 it instigated 420 receiverships, but following the introduction of
its new bad debt division, this fell to 150 in 1993 and should drop to 100
this year, as it has looks for alternative solutions, such as swaps.
Mr Sachs says: 'Traditionally, the UK clearing banks have been reluctant to
convert debt into equity. We take the view that, more and more, we are
looking at the overall financing of the company.'
There are downsides. By initiating the swap, a bank is generally forced to
make balance sheet provisions, since the value of the equity is unlikely to
match that of the debt.
As a shareholder, the bank's call upon the assets of the company is
substantially reduced, so if the company does not survive, it is unlikely to
get anything back.
In addition, the size of the banking syndicates can complicate negotiations.
Many continental European banks have historically been more relaxed about
equity, but it has proved difficult for such disparate interest groups to
reach agreement.
In the case of WPP, the response to the efforts of Mr Martin Sorrell, its
chief executive, for a restructuring, was far from unanimous from its
28-member banking syndicate. The Japanese banks were strongly against the
debt-for-equity package.
There have been a number of cases where such scepticism may have been
justified. One of last year's larger debt-for-equity swaps, for distressed
fuels group Anglo United, has left banks owning half the shares of a
shrinking group.
The consortium swapped Pounds 45.9m of debt into 459.3m new shares at 10p
each, when the share price was only 5 1/2 p. HSBC, the main lender, was left
with a 40 per cent stake.
A further Pounds 74.9m of debt was swapped into convertible stock, with a
10p conversion price, and no interest, although the conversion price will be
reduced to assume 10 per cent compound interest a year.
The pricing of the new shares demonstrated the severity of Anglo United's
corporate ailments in February 1993, and the banks would have made large
provisions against their exposure to the company.
The situation has since deteriorated. The Pounds 120m of restructured debt
is worth a fraction of the original loan, as the share price has dropped to
1.34p, giving the entire company a market value of Pounds 16m.
Even in such a case, however, the banks can still gain some recompense
through the notoriously high fees for a restructuring.
In the case of Anglo United, advisers and bankers took Pounds 8.9m in fees,
while WPP's restructuring cost the company Pounds 13m, of which Pounds 9m
went to the banks for providing new loan facilities.
The decision often comes down to a lack of choice. The recession left many
borrowers with more debt than they could ever expect to repay.
Property companies, with negative net assets, have been a prime target for
swaps, since property values have been rising far more rapidly than rents
and the related ability to pay interest.
Dares Estates, UK Land and Raglan Property Trust were all kept afloat
through swaps which should deliver some return to bankers, where liquidation
would have probably brought nothing.
One corporate financier claimed the banks had already been too slow to react
to change. 'They want to take equity now that values have gone up
enormously', he said. 'But two years ago, when they have could have
benefited substantially, they were just not interested.'
Given the profits achieved by WPP's bankers, however, they may be encouraged
to change their minds.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Survey of Malaysia (4): Where chips eclipse smelters -
Penang is Malaysia's electronics power house
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I suppose you want to know when the bubble is going burst?' said Mr Ariff
Nazir, boss of the old tin smelter in the middle of Penang.
It was not an unreasonable question. The small island off the west coast of
the Malaysian peninsula has, for the past 10 years, been the most dynamic
growth region in Malaysia and one of the most dynamic in the world.
Average annual growth has been over 10 per cent since 1988, usually at least
two percentage points above the national average, and even when foreign
direct investment started to falter last year in the country as a whole it
was scarcely dented in Penang, the centre of Malaysia's electronics
industry.
Mr Nazir had just returned from a ceremony to launch a new programme linking
Penang's top electronics companies - Hewlett Packard, Hitachi, Bosch, etc -
to local small and medium-sized businesses. At the ceremony, Mr Koh Tsu
Koon, Penang's chief minister, and Mrs Rafidah Aziz, Malaysia's trade and
industry minister, both emphasised the importance of deepening Penang's
industrial revolution and making it less dependent on low value-added
assembly operations.
Twenty years ago Mr Nazir's tin smelter was still the largest employer on
the island. Now its 500 employees are outnumbered by the 3,000 employed by
dozens of electronics plants. The smelter is still one of the biggest in the
world, producing about 30,000 of the 150,000 tonnes of annual world output,
but it is being run down gradually so that its owners (ultimately the German
group Preussag) can sell off a prime city centre site.
The smelter is not, however, immune to the symptoms of over-heating all
around it. Mr Nazir, for example, is trying to hire 60 extra labourers for
his unionised plant at a reasonable rate of close to MDollars 500 a month.
So far he has found just two.
But he remains an optimist. 'The bubble will not burst here because the
state government is sensible enough to let out some of the air', he says. It
is, for example, discouraging labour-intensive investments in Penang,
especially from the Taiwanese. Companies such as Dastek, which is shifting
disk drive production to China, are being encouraged to move to lower labour
cost parts of Malaysia or to other countries in the region.
The Northern Growth Triangle (NGT) - the agreement between the governments
of Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia to improve cross border economic
activity - should encourage this exodus.
'We are becoming a great deal more pickey about the kind of investor we want
in Penang,' says Miss Lim Pao Li, managing director of DCT consultancy
services, part of the Pengang Development Corporation. She said this while
sitting in the dark, thanks to one of the power cuts common in a region
knocking up against capacity constraints.
Such constraints on power supply as well as transport capacity will not be
resolved by upgrading Penang's production base. Nor will such upgrading
diminish the growing pollution problem which has made much of the sea around
the island unfit for tourists to swim in.
Nevertheless, Penang will remain the focus of Malaysia's belated transition
to higher value-added production. As wage rates continue to rise sharply,
some of the generous investment subsidies are phased out (part of the Gatt
agreement on world trade), and shifts in exchange rates become less
favourable, the region has little choice.
Wages in Penang are substantially above levels elsewhere in the country,
with basic wages (excluding many fringe benefits, but including overtime)
for skilled workers around MDollars 800 a month. Yet the electronics sector,
which employs about 60 per cent of the region's 170,000 manufacturing
workers (out of a total workforce of 450,000), has an annual value-added per
employee of only MDollars 14,000 per year, placing it way behind basic
industries such as flour-milling.
Low value-added electronic components - where Malaysian factories usually
add only about 30 per cent of the value of a product - still account for
about 40 per cent of the country's electronic sector, although that is down
from as high as 80 per cent in 1986. In Penang (which accounts for about
half of the country's electronic industry) there has been robust growth in
industrial and consumer electronics.
There are also some signs of increasing automation and the basing of more
design and R&amp;D work in Penang. Intel is building an integrated manufacturing
plant in Penang. Motorola already locates its worldwide R&amp;D centre for
mobile phones and pagers in Penang employing more than 100 engineers at an
annual cost of more than MDollars 5m.
But Penang, like Malaysia as a whole, lacks graduate scientists and skilled
technicians. Mr Ismail Mohamed Salleh, of the ISIS think-tank, says in a
recent paper on the electronics industry in Malaysia: 'While some products
are close to the forefront of technology  ..there has been little deepening
in the product design and technologies of the products themselves.'
Penang is still booming, but as one business leader put it: 'We have reached
the end of the road on our first phase of industrial development and we do
not yet have the people for the second phase.'

FT  30 AUG 94 / Survey of Malaysia (3): Driven by exports - The strains and
stresses of economic success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like a runner who chalks up record lap after record lap, Malaysia's economy
continues to run ahead at a dizzying pace.
Last year Malaysia's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 8.5 per cent - the
sixth successive year of plus 8 per cent growth. In the first quarter of
this year GDP expanded by 8.6 per cent: predictions for full year growth now
range from 8.2 to more than 9 per cent.
There have been warnings that the economy is in danger of overheating and
that such high growth cannot be sustained. Some analysts worry about growing
imports and a rise in consumer spending. Malaysia is also in danger of
losing competitiveness with wages rising faster than productivity. The
government has to struggle to attract more inward investment.
However, faced with a barrage of favourable statistics, such concerns are
easily brushed aside by a government eager to promote the success of its
economic policies.
The goal that has eluded economic planners worldwide - achieving high growth
while keeping inflation low - seems to have been achieved. Despite the years
of economic expansion inflation has rarely risen above 5 per cent.
The long term goal is to achieve full industrialisation by the year 2020 - a
plan called Vision 2020 by the government's copywriters. To meet that target
Malaysia's economy needs to grow by 7 per cent in each of the next 26 years.
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, dismisses the idea that this is
overly ambitious. He points out that for much of the period since Malaysia's
independence from Britain in 1957, Malaysia's economy has grown each year by
well over 6 per cent. 'I am confident that the targets of Vision 2020 are
attainable,' says Dr Mahathir. 'The Government and its successors are
committed to this vision.'
The engine of economic growth has been the wholesale expansion of an export
orientated manufacturing sector. Over the past 20 years Malaysia has been
transformed from a commodity based to a manufacturing economy. In 1971, more
than 80 per cent of exports were commodities - mainly tin, rubber and
petroleum products. In 1993, manufactured goods formed more than 70 per cent
of exports. 'There is no doubt that had we remained with tin and rubber, we
would be a basket case today,' says Dr Mahathir. 'Manufacturing saved us.'
One of the achievements of the Malaysian economy is that the expansion in
the manufacturing sector and double digit rises in exports of recent years
took place while recessionary winds were blowing through key export markets.
Overall output in the manufacturing sector expanded 12.8 per cent last year
while the value of manufacturing exports rose 26 per cent to MDollars 90bn.
Now, with the economic outlook in the west improving, Malaysia is confident
that the export growth of recent years can at least be sustained and fuel
the continued expansion of the manufacturing sector. In the first quarter of
1994 output in the manufacturing sector grew by 13.7 per cent.
The public finances are in good order. For the first time in more than 30
years Malaysia achieved a balanced budget in 1993. High rates of domestic
savings, at about 34 per cent of GNP, provide a ready source of funding for
onward growth.
'That we are on track for yet another robust year is very encouraging for
us,' said Mr Anwar Ibrahim, the deputy prime minister and finance minister,
in June.
However, economic success has brought its problems. The number one priority
of Malaysia's monetary authorities has been the fight against inflation.
Encouraged by the buoyant economy and a stockmarket that rose by nearly 100
per cent last year, massive amounts of foreign funds have washed into the
country. Speculators also pushed funds in, hoping to gain from a rise in the
ringgit, the Malaysian dollar.
Bank Negara, the central bank, was forced to mop up MDollars 40bn in excess
liquidity from the banking system last year in order to stop the build up of
inflationary pressures in the economy.
Malaysia has embarked on a large scale programme to build up its
infrastructure. New airports, power stations, roads and railways are being
constructed. Such projects, besides relieving some of the bottlenecks that
have built up in the economy, will further fuel growth. However, imports of
expensive capital equipment associated with such projects - particularly in
relation to yen denominated Japanese goods - have caused balance of payments
problems.
A strong revival in domestic spending has increased economic activity but
has also spurred a rise in imports. A Bank Negara prediction made earlier
this year of a 1994 MDollars 9.3bn surplus in the merchandise account of the
balance of payments is generally regarded as over optimistic: a widening
deficit in the services account - projected at more than MDollars 15bn - is
likely to lead to a current account deficit of more than MDollars 6bn.
Of more concern in the long term are a number of structural problems within
the economy. Chief among these is a shortage of labour which in turn has led
to upward pressures on wages. Till now the government has managed to dampen
wage demands by, on the one hand, keeping down inflation and, on the other,
by importing hundreds of thousands of workers, mostly from Indonesia and
Bangladesh. In many sectors of Malaysia's plantation industry immigrant
workers make up more than 60 per cent of the workforce.
Officials realise that such dependence on immigrant labour could cause long
term social problems. Using unskilled imported labour to keep down wages is
unlikely to be an option as Malaysia seeks to enter a new, more
skills-orientated phase.
Already there are signs of a widening wages/productivity gap. A recent
survey found that nationwide wages rose 7.3 per cent in the first six months
of 1994 while productivity increased by only 2 per cent. 'We will do
everything we can to make sure the welfare of workers is protected,' says Mr
Anwar. 'But we do not want this to be at the expense of productivity or
Malaysia losing its competitiveness against its neighbouring countries.'
On one level Malaysia's leaders realise that the country is no longer an
ideal low cost, labour intensive investment site. 'If you are looking for
cheap labour and lower technology, Malaysia is not the place for you,' Mrs
Rafidah Aziz, the trade and industry minister, told US investors. 'We are
looking for jobs with more brain power required, not just brawn power.'
However, Malaysia's manufacturing sector has yet to mature into a high tech,
skills based industry. The country has severe skills shortages. It spends
very little on R&amp;D. It still has a narrow industrial base: electronics and
electrical appliances account for about 60 per cent of manufacturing
exports. Much of the electronics industry, dominated by foreign
multinationals, is still devoted to labour intensive assembly work. About
two thirds of manufactured exports have import ratios of between 60 and 80
per cent.
A 66 per cent drop in foreign investment last year was shrugged off by the
government as only a temporary phenomenon. Investment from abroad did indeed
pick up in the first six month of 1994, though to nothing like levels
earlier in the decade. The government is now emphasising the need to
encourage investment from domestic sources: but a lot of foreign expertise
and capital is necessary to develop high tech industries.
The Malaysian economy is running ahead at full steam. The big question is
whether it has sufficient strength to stay the distance and complete the
race to full industrialisation.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Survey of Malaysia (5): Where three states meet - The
northern triangle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Penang is now trying to market itself as the industrial hub of a 'growth
triangle' linking the northern peninsula of Malaysia, north Sumatra in
Indonesia, and the southern states of Thailand.
This growth triangle, following an earlier southern version based around
Singapore, was endorsed by all three governments last year.
The third meeting of the Northern Growth Triangle (NGT)governments this
December, flanked by meetings of business leaders, will discuss a report
from the Asian Development Bank containing proposals for improving transport
links and labour mobility and establishing cross-border industrial estates.
The NGT is meant to be business-led but the three governments have rather
different attitudes to their business organisations. The Thai government is
happy to let the business leaders take control, but the Indonesian
government is more intent on keeping control. The Malaysian government lies
somewhere in the middle with an important role in promoting the NGT taken by
the Penang state government.
Mr Koh Tsu Koon, chief minister of Penang, and most influential Penang
business leaders, see the NGT as a means of channelling labour intensive
operations out of Penang and into northern Malaysia or southern Thailand.
Meanwhile, Penang hopes to become a regional centre for business services,
research and development and high value-added production.
Some business leaders fear that the NGT may aim too high and disappoint
expectations.
'It would be nice if we could abolish all tariffs and borders and have
completely free movement of capital, goods and people. But it takes decades
to get anywhere if national sovereignty is at stake, just look at how long
it is taking to harmonise regulations in the European Union', warns one
Penang business leader.
He believes that the greatest potential in the short-term is in sorting out
some of the transport bottlenecks. Currently, for example, there are no
flights between Penang and Southern Thailand and there is no direct sea link
across the straits of Malacca linking Penang with Medan. Freight has to
travel all the way down to Singapore and back up again.
He also believes that travel restrictions could be removed allowing for much
more free movement for business people. This is not the same as free
movement of labour.
There is already a large flow of immigrant labour - much of it illegal -
from the periphery to fast developing regions like Penang. But the
Malaysians worry about being swamped by foreigners and hope that the NGT
might help to slow the flow by providing more jobs in the outlying regions.
The Asian Development Bank report, which will form the basis of December's
meeting, is expected to concentrate on the following themes: Highway
development, air services, streamlining of regulations and tariffs, a gas
pipeline, labour mobility, cross-border industrial estates and tourism.

FT  30 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Seaperfect to float with likely Pounds 50m
value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A company which claims to be one of the world's largest controlled producers
of shellfish is hoping to come to the market later this year with an
estimated value of about Pounds 50m.
Seaperfect plans to raise approximately Pounds 20m through an institutional
placing to fund the expansion of its scallop and clam farming activities.
In May, the company raised Pounds 3m through a private placing with UK
institutions.
The company's product has attracted some well-known faces to the board. Mr
Andre Bernard, former co-chairman of Eurotunnel, will become a non-executive
director next month, and Sir David Orr, ex-chairman of Unilever and
Inchcape, is non-executive chairman.
Seaperfect was founded in 1988 by American-born Mr William Lord-Butcher, who
made his fortune in the 1980s with the sale of his direct mail marketing
business to a New York investment group. He said shellfish were the perfect
follow-on to computers. 'We were looking for a species that was ready to be
industrialised.'
The company farms scallops and clams in the warm water regions of South
Carolina, Florida and Chile, which Mr Lord-Butcher argues is an advantage
when competing against the Japanese. On average, Seaperfect's Chilean-raised
scallops take 15 to 17 months to mature, against three to seven years in
Japan.
The scallops and clams are mostly for export to Europe. Most of the
shellfish eaten in Europe is wild produce caught by local fishermen trawling
the sea or estuaries.
However, Mr Lord-Butcher argues that health and safety concerns mean that
commercial farming - where the environment is tested on a regular basis and
harvesting and processing is strictly controlled - will become increasingly
important.
Seaperfect sells its scallops and clams to the catering and retail industry,
before harvesting them from the field.
They are bred in protected hatcheries and the larvae nursed until old and
big enough to be put out to sea.
Last year Seaperfect sold 15,000 scallops, or some 203 tonnes, by far its
largest business.
Mr Lord-Butcher is confident the group can more than double sales with the
funds from a flotation.

FT  30 AUG 94 / UK Company News: New dealing regulations have little impact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new insider dealing regulations which came into force on March 1 have
had little impact on the way companies communicate with the City, according
to a survey published today.
The new rules, and related advice from the Stock Exchange, were seen as
threatening cherished practices such as the 'brokers' lunch'.
However, three quarters of the companies surveyed said they had not changed
their attitude to the use of brokers' lunches and only 14 per cent had
altered their approach to analysts' briefings. But half said they had
changed their opinion on what constituted important information that should
be communicated through the Stock Exchange.
Mr Jonathan Gillen, managing director of Focus Communications, which
conducted the survey, said: 'The Act would appear to have had little or no
effect. In reality the virtuous are still self-policing just as before. The
perception that it might create a new attitude towards shareholder relations
seems to have been overstated.'
The survey showed that the new rules had created a good deal of confusion
among companies. More than three quarters admitted they were vague or
unclear as to the implications for analysts' meetings and only half were
confident they knew the implications for conducting a takeover.
'There appears to be considerable potential for someone to transgress the
rules by mistake,' said Mr Gillen.
The SE's suggestion that companies issue quarterly trading statements has
not proved popular. Only 12 per cent of companies said they would do so with
a further 20 per cent considering it. But 25 per cent said they would
consider an announcement if brokers' estimates were out of line with current
trading.
The sample consisted of the top 350 UK companies and a further 150 smaller
companies, with replies received from 177.

FT  30 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Disclosure plans for sales of unit trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies which sell unit trusts - pooled investment funds  - are to be
required to give customers more information about the investment products
and about their fees and charges, under plans to be introduced next year.
The move follows the imposition of a new regime which requires companies and
individuals selling life insurance policies to disclose more about the
policies and the incentives paid to those who sell them. This will come into
effect in January.
A consultation paper on what information should be included in the
disclosure regime for other financial products, including unit trusts, is to
be published by the Personal Investment Authority, the new watchdog to
protect the private investor, next month.
It should have simpler requirements than for selling long-term life and
investment policies - since unit trusts themselves are simpler  - but the
aim will be to enable customers to make a fair comparison between the
different types of financial products available.
Unit trusts have been growing in popularity with private investors. In the
first half of this year net retail sales grew from Pounds 2bn to Pounds
3.9bn.
The PIA hopes to have made the detailed rules for unit trust disclosure by
the end of the year, so that the new regime can be optional from January
when the regime for life companies becomes compulsory.
The similar regime for unit trusts is intended to be mandatory from next
July.
The pace at which unit trust companies adopt the new pattern of giving
information to customers in advance of that date is likely to vary.
Some will want to move to the new system early, in order not to appear to be
less open with customers in the sale of unit trusts than in the sale of life
insurance products.
Others will want to move later in order to take account of the other changes
likely to affect unit trusts next year which will require significant
changes to computer systems and to the documents provided to customers.
The most important likely change is a move away from the current system of
dual pricing, under which investors buy units at an 'offer' price and sell
at a lower 'bid' price, to a system of single pricing, which is intended to
make unit trusts easier to understand.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Bull set for return to black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Groupe Bull, the troubled French computer manufacturer, will show a profit
at the operating level by the end of this financial year and could be
profitable at the net level by the middle of 1995.
Mr Jean-Marie Descarpentries, appointed chairman of the state-controlled
group 10 months ago, told the Financial Times that the company had improved
its performance faster than expected. It was now in a position to plan and
implement a growth strategy.
The sale of Groupe Bull, in which the state has a 73 per cent stake, has
been seen as one of the more difficult of the 21 privatisations planned by
the French government. The company lost in excess of FFr15bn (Pounds 1.8bn)
over the last three years.
It showed an improvement in its first-half results, cutting a deficit of
FFr1.72bn to FFr843m. Nevertheless, a turnaround at the pace indicated by Mr
Descarpentries would be remarkable, and a sharp rejoinder to those who had
written off Bull as the least likely to recover of Europe's ailing computer
companies.
A rapid return to profitability will have two principal consequences. First,
it will encourage potential shareholders who are following the company's
progress but holding back on investment. Second, it should convince Brussels
that Bull's recovery plan is working and clear the way for approval of a
final FFr3.1bn of government money to reduce Bull's debts.
It is unlikely that the government's stake in Bull will be reduced to a
minority position by the end of the year. It is thought that one of Bull's
existing shareholders, the Japanese company NEC, will increase its
shareholding and that one other large equity partner will be found.
Mr Descarpentries said any new equity partner would have to be a leader in
one of Bull's main business areas. He had been given a free hand in the
choice of equity partner and there was no reason why it should not be a
foreign owned company.
He said he was seeking industrial partners in Bull's key technologies and
the first two would be announced early in September.
Mr Descarpentries said the speed of the recovery was the result of pressure
on costs and new organisational and reporting structures. He had rejected
conventional turnround methods involving closing businesses and huge
redundancies.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Survey of Malaysia (1): Full steam ahead - Malaysia is still
developing at breakneck speed but problems lie ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Showing few signs of strain, Malaysia continues to canter towards its goal
of full industrialisation by the year 2020. Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime
minister and driving force behind the country's modernisation programme, can
point to a long table of impressive statistics.
For the sixth year in a row Malaysia's gross domestic product expanded by
more than 8 per cent in 1993. GDP growth this year is officially forecast at
8.4 per cent, though many feel it could be over 9 per cent. The Malaysian
economy has been transformed: in 1970 commodities, mostly rubber and tin,
made up the bulk of exports. In 1993 manufactured goods accounted for more
than 70 per cent of exports.
Malaysia, with only 19m people, is now the world's 19th biggest trading
nation. It has become one of the hubs of the global electronics industry and
manufactures a wide range of other goods, from motor cars to condoms, haute
couture fashions to household furniture. There is virtual full employment
and per capita incomes have risen from Dollars 350 in 1970 to close to
Dollars 3,000 today.
Dr Mahathir does not think the country is setting its sights too high. 'We
are not an ambitious upstart. We are in fact very modest,' he says.
But while the short term outlook remains rosy, serious problems could put
the industrialisation plans off course. Malaysia's development has reached a
plateau. With severe labour shortages in many areas and wages rising, the
country is facing growing competition from lower cost producers such as
Indonesia, Vietnam and China.
Malaysia's economic growth has been driven by its success in attracting
large amounts of foreign investment. Despite a pick up in investment
approvals this year, investment in the economy is still well below the
levels achieved earlier in the decade. Some potential foreign investors have
become nervous as Malaysia has allowed political disputes with both
Australia and Britain to spill over into the business arena.
The next phase of Malaysia's development will be dependent on a transfer
into more high tech, value added industries. One concern is that Malaysia's
industrial base is too narrow - largely dependent on a sector which is still
overwhelmingly dominated by foreign multinational companies.
Electronic goods now make up about 40 per cent of Malaysia's total exports.
While progress has been made in promoting linkages between Malaysian based
multinationals and local manufacturers, well over 50 per cent of the value
of electronic exports is made up of imported goods. Another problem is the
reluctance of foreign companies to transfer technology and so help Malaysia
up the high tech ladder. Part of this is due to the multinational companies'
wish to keep their core industrial processes captive. But it is also due to
shortcomings within Malaysia.
Malaysia's education system has failed to keep pace with recent economic
changes. The country has more than 1m immigrant workers, many of them
illegal, labouring on plantations, construction sites and in low technology
factory jobs. Such a large immigrant workforce is already posing a challenge
to the country's delicate racial and religious balance and to its social
services.
But the real squeeze on labour is at the higher, more skilled end of the
market. Many Malaysians still show a strong reluctance to go into higher
education. The proportion of students aged 20-24 in tertiary education is
about 7 per cent, compared with 11 per cent in Indonesia, 16 per cent in
Thailand and 28 per cent in the Philippines.
Malaysia risks being caught in a medium technology trap: it lacks the all
important human resources to follow the path into high tech of countries
such as South Korea and Taiwan. Allied to this is a serious shortfall in R&amp;D
spending: present spending in Malaysia is less than one per cent of GDP,
compared with two to three per cent in developed countries.
Problems in the education sector are mainly related to the majority Malay
community. Senior officials now openly refer to a Malay educational crisis.
By not investing in education the Malays risk losing their stake in the
country's future.
Traditionally the Chinese, who account for about 35 per cent of the
population, exercised a large degree of control over the economy. In the
early 1970s the government, in response to serious race rioting, introduced
its New Economic Policy (NEP). The aim was to eradicate poverty and increase
bumiputra, or indigenous Malay, participation in the economy.
Malays were favoured in education, in government jobs and other fields. They
were given preferential and highly lucrative share allocations as the
government embarked on a widescale late 1980s privatisation programme. The
NEP was a partial success: according to official statistics bumiputras
controlled more than 20 per cent of corporate activity by 1990, up from
fewer than 5 per cent 20 years earlier.
Dr Mahathir berates bumiputras for their 'get rich quick' mentality and
failing to make long term investments. Yet government policies have tended
to encourage Malay dependence on official favours.
A new National Development policy (NDP), covering the years 1991-2000, puts
more emphasis on growth and market forces as a means of achieving some form
of economic equilibrium between the races. But recent figures show that,
since the advent of the NDP, the bumiputra share in the corporate sector has
declined.
There is concern that, despite job shortages, a substantial portion of the
younger generation are not working or studying - threatening the country's
onward growth. Similar fears are expressed by other Asian governments. The
west serves as a convenient whipping horse and is blamed for spreading moral
decay and indiscipline. In reality the younger generation is less receptive
to constant calls for more hard work and is not so willing to kowtow to its
elders.
In Malaysia's strictly hierarchical system, there is little room for
alternative voices or for questioning the direction of government policy.
People feel there is a lack of transparency and accountability.
The government has control over most of the media. Dr Mahathir's United
Malays National party (UMNO) has dominated government since independence
from Britain in 1957. Dr Mahathir has been in power since 1981.
The past year has seen its share of scandals, but Dr Mahathir's government
has escaped unscathed. Bank Negara, the central bank, disclosed in March
that it lost MDollars 5.7bn (Dollars 2.22bn) in foreign currency
transactions last year. That followed foreign exchange losses of nearly
Dollars 10bn in 1992, though the overall losses may have been considerably
higher. Mr Lim Kit Siang, an opposition leader, described the misjudged
currency dealings as the 'the greatest financial scandal in Malaysian
history'.
Bank Negara's governor and some senior officials resigned. But the
government quickly closed the book on any official enquiry into the affair.
The prime minister is strongly critical of what is called 'money politics'.
Yet the small and divided opposition says that it is Dr Mahathir's UMNO
party, through political handouts at successive elections, which has
encouraged the growth of political corruption.
Dr Mahathir advances the idea of Malaysia Inc, tirelessly travelling the
world with a bevy of corporate leaders in pursuit of business opportunities.
The problem is that political connections are often felt to be more
important than company balance sheets.
The Kuala Lumpur stock market, now southeast Asia's biggest in terms of
market capitalisation, rose by 98 per cent last year. Part of that rise was
due to Malaysia's strong economic fundamentals and the activities of well
managed, cash rich companies. But the most lively stocks were those known
less for their corporate expertise than for their connections to senior
politicians.
Malaysia's leaders, flush with the success of recent years, are confident
that they are steering the country on the right path. But their carefully
laid plans could go seriously off course unless pressing economic, social
and political problems are tackled.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Banks set to make Pounds 100m on WPP swap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A syndicate of 28 international banks which acquired convertible preference
shares in WPP, the international advertising group, as part of a Dollars
271.6m (Pounds 176m) debt-for-equity swap two years ago expect to make a
profit of around Pounds 100m when the shares are sold, probably later this
week.
The banks including Barclays, National Westminster, Midland and JP Morgan
will convert 169.5m of the convertible preference shares they hold into
190.2m ordinary shares after the close of business on the London Stock
Exchange tomorrow and are free to sell the shares immediately.
The shares, representing a 26.5 per cent stake in WPP's enlarged capital,
are expected to be sold to UK and overseas institutional investors. The
placing is being organised by a consortium comprising Bankers Trust
International, JP Morgan Securities and SG Warburg Securities.
The sale highlights WPP's remarkable recovery. Earlier this month the
company reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 36.2m for the first half, up 50
per cent on the figures a year earlier, helped by falling interest charges
and improving margins.
The bank syndicate agreed to swap the Dollars 271.6m of debt for 239.5m new
convertible preference shares in July 1992 when WPP was suffering from the
recession in the advertising industry and struggling to service its high
borrowings.
The preference shares were originally convertible into ordinary shares at a
notional price of 60p a share, but the conversion price was lowered to about
45p after WPP held a rights issue at that price in March last year. Since
then WPP's share price has soared and closed at 119p on Friday compared with
a low of 22.5p. The shares are expected to be placed at around 100p.
Under the terms of the debt-for-equity swap the banks converted a quarter of
their preference shares last September and sold the resulting ordinary
shares for around a Pounds 16m profit.
The final tranche of the bank's 12.2m convertible preference shares is
convertible at any time. Conversion of these shares would mean the issue of
a further 13.7m new ordinary shares - 1.9 per cent of the enlarged capital -
and would eliminate the overhang of WPP paper.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Lloyd's to boost corporate funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London is expecting to raise between Pounds 125m and Pounds 250m
in capital from corporate investors over the next few months, according to
Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive of the insurance market.
The extra funds will help offset a decline in capital supplied by Names, the
individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the market, but the
market's capacity is still likely to fall in 1995.
Capacity, the amount of premiums Lloyd's syndicates can accept, is currently
about Pounds 11bn but could drop next year to between Pounds 9bn and Pounds
9.5bn, said Mr Middleton, giving details for the first time in an interview
with the Financial Times.
The new money is likely to be channelled towards so-called 'dedicated'
insurance funds, which provide capital for syndicates exclusively managed by
particular agencies. Several agencies - including Venton and Kiln - are
working on schemes using dedicated corporate capital.
Last year corporate investors put some Pounds 800m into Lloyds investment
vehicles, which spread their investments across a range of syndicates and
agencies.
Mr Middleton also predicted that a large number of Names would limit their
liability by joining new schemes which are expected to allow individual
Names to form insurance companies. Names would transfer their liabilities to
the new incorporated entities. He expected 'the bulk' of Names to switch to
the new arrangements over the next few years.
Lloyd's was considering a scheme proposed by Citibank as well as 'three or
four other very imaginative approaches'. If approved, the new schemes would
allow individuals to trade on an incorporated basis next year. 'We have no
problems with the main principles,' said Mr Middleton.
The number of Names underwriting as sole traders, without any limit on
liability for their losses, could eventually fall to 3,000, he predicted.
However these initiatives are not expected to help Names who have
insufficient resources to continue trading in the market.
Mr Middleton said that while Lloyd's was keen to secure payment by Names who
could afford to meet their debts, those unable to meet their obligations
would not be pursued. 'We are absolutely not going to knock the doors down
of old women and twist their arms until they sign us a cheque,' he said.
Although some Pounds 2bn is owed by Names, as much as Pounds 15m to Pounds
20m a day in payments have been made over the summer months.
Earlier this year, Lloyd's announced a loss of about Pounds 2bn for the 1991
year of account.
Mr Middleton also predicted that corporate investors would commit larger
sums as soon as details became available on the formation of NewCo, a new
reinsurance company. Lloyd's aims to transfer all liabilities on insurance
policies underwritten before 1986 to NewCo, early in 1996.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Ivax buys Zenith in generic merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ivax, a generic drugs manufacturer based in Miami, announced the purchase of
rival drug maker Zenith Laboratories in an all-stock deal valuing Zenith at
nearly Dollars 600m.
The transaction, if completed, will create what the companies claim will be
the world's biggest maker of generic, or non-branded, pharmaceuticals. The
two had generic drugs sales of Dollars 570m last year.
Generic drug makers produce low-cost variants of branded drugs that have
come off patent. Patent expiries and pressure for lower-cost drugs have made
the generics sector one of the fastest growing in the pharmaceuticals
industry, with the US market put at Dollars 4bn-Dollars 6bn last year.
Together, the two companies will constitute 'a powerful force in a
fragmented industry,' said Mr Steven Gerber, an analyst at Oppenheimer in
the US. Mylan, the biggest independent US generic drugs company, had sales
of Dollars 250m in the year to March.
Ivax and Zenith had a pipeline of products awaiting approval from the US
Food and Drug Administration, bolstering their prospects for future growth,
said Mr Gerber. Ivax said they made 63 drugs between them and had
applications for 40 more before the FDA.
Zenith had sales last year of Dollars 96m and net income of Dollars 18.4m.
Ivax, which had total revenues last year of Dollars 976m, generated around a
quarter of its generics sales outside the US. Its principal overseas
operations are in the UK, where it owns Norton Healthcare. It has operations
in the Czech Republic, Germany and China.
The company has gained a reputation for skills in the manufacturer of
time-release drugs, which are absorbed into the body over a period of time.
This technology gives it an edge over other generics companies, to some
degree protecting its profit margins. Under normal competitive
circumstances, generics drugs sell for as little as 10 per cent of the price
of the branded alternative.
The purchase of Zenith, which has been rumoured for some months, is likely
to increase competition for other independent manufacturers.
Branded drugs companies have also shown interest in acquisitions in the
generic area, most recently with Marion Merrell Dow's purchase of the
Rugby-Darby group.

FT  30 AUG 94 / A dose of OTC medicine for growth strategy: SmithKline
Beecham's hyperactivity on the deals front
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since April, when Mr Jan Leschly became chief executive of SmithKline
Beecham, the Anglo-US healthcare company, he has been suffering from
hyperactivity.
In May, he spent Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds 1.5bn) on Diversified Pharmaceutical
Services, a US pharmacy benefit manager, to support his North American
pharmaceuticals operations; earlier this month he offered to swap his
vaccines and animal health businesses for assets from American Cyanamid
before it was acquired by American Home Products; and yesterday, he splashed
out a further Dollars 2.925bn on Sterling Health, Sterling Winthrop's over
the counter (OTC) non-prescription medicines business.
Mr Leschly, a former Wimbledon quarter-finalist, says all this activity is
part of his aim to make SB the world's largest healthcare company.
Yesterday's purchase goes some way to achieving that ambition.
The deal, the largest ever OTC acquisition, doubles the size of SB's OTC
operations and makes it the world's biggest maker of OTC medicines,
outselling Johnson &amp; Johnson of the US. The combined group would have OTC
sales of about Dollars 2bn.
The move strengthen SB's presence in the OTC market, worth about Dollars
30bn a year and growing at a rate of about 6 per cent.
The OTC sector is being driven by the desire of drugs groups to extend the
product life of their medicines after the patents expire. They believe this
can be achieved by switching their drugs to non-prescription status and then
marketing them direct to the public. More than half of the US's 50
top-selling drugs are scheduled to lose protection over the next four years.
The growing OTC trend is also being encouraged by cash-strapped governments
because it switches the burden of payment to the patient.
Having targeted the OTC market, Mr Leschly insists the acquisition of
Sterling Health makes strategic sense in terms of both products and
geography.
'Before this deal we just did not have critical mass. More than Dollars 700m
of our Dollars 1bn sales were in just three markets - the US, the UK and
Germany. Elsewhere we were just too weak,' he says.
In contrast only 33 per cent of Sterling Health's activities are in the US.
The company is the second largest OTC group in Italy and France, fourth in
the UK and the market leader in Denmark and Portugal. The group is also the
largest manufacturer in Latin America, where the market should reach Dollars
4.8bn by the end of the decade, according to IMS Global Services, the market
research company. Sterling Health is among the top three OTC suppliers in
the Asia-Pacific area, excluding Japan.
The combined company would be market leader in Europe with annual sales of
more than Pounds 200m and fourth in the US with sales above Pounds 600m. The
international (rest of the world) business would total more than Pounds
300m.
In terms of products, the acquisition gives SB significant positions in the
three most important OTC categories: analgesics, cough and cold remedies,
and gastrointestinal products.
In analgesics, the largest segment, SB acquires Sterling's Panadol. This is
sold in 64 countries and generated sales last year of Dollars 250m, making
it one of the world's biggest OTC products. SB also gains Bayer Asprin in
the US.
The deal also gives the group a strong position in digestive remedies, the
third most important OTC category. SB is in the process of launching an OTC
version of its once top-selling pharmaceutical product, Tagamet. Mr Leschly
says this should complement its existing Tums and Eno antacid remedies.
Sterling controls the Phillips' Milk of Magnesia and the Andrews brands.
Mr Leschly denies Tagamet could cannibalise the other digestive products.
'Tagamet is a completely different ball of wax from the others,' he insists.
In the cough and cold market, where SB already has brands such as Contac and
Night Nurse, it takes control of Sterling Health's Valda and some smaller
products.
Mr Hugh Collum, SB's finance director, believes the deal makes not only
strategic, but also financial sense. Sterling Health had sales last year of
Dollars 1bn and made operating profits of Dollars 162m. SB gains the
business for about three times sales and 18.5 times earnings. That compares
with Roche's 1991 acquisition of Nicholas Laboratories at more than four
times sales and about 30 times earnings.
However, the deal lumbers SB with substantial debt. Mr Collum says gearing,
already at 60 per cent after the acquisition of Diversified, would rise as
high as 300 per cent. However, interest cover would still be about 20 times,
he stresses, and gearing should fall to less than 100 per cent by 1996.
To achieve that, Mr Leschly is banking on cashflow, rationalisation and
asset sales. 'But we will only sell businesses when this is strategically
right.'
The rationalisation will involve taking costs out of the combined OTC
businesses. In addition, Mr Leschly intends to cut costs at the
international and European pharmaceuticals operations. Yesterday, he
announced a Pounds 500m charge, half to be spent this year, half next year.
Additional costs could be taken out of the animal health business in 1995,
he added
Mr Leschly's hyperactivity appears incurable: he is not ruling out further
deals. 'We are looking for opportunities in the pharmaceuticals industry. We
won't be rushed, and we certainly won't buy things at the sort of prices
we've seen in recent week's (American Home Product's Dollars 9.7bn
acquisition of American Cyanamid), but we're definitely in the market.'

FT  30 AUG 94 / China cracks down to protect Sega copyright
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chinese authorities have ordered an electronics company in the south of the
country to stop making video games machines with programmes identical to
those marketed by Sega Enterprises of Japan.
The victory for Sonic the Hedgehog and other Sega characters represents what
is believed to be the first Chinese administrative measure against a local
manufacturer over infringement of a foreign computer company's software.
It comes not long after a Beijing court ruled that Mickey Mouse's image
could not be used without the US Walt Disney group's permission.
China's National Copyright Administration has ordered the Shenzhen Shenchu
Electronic Equipment Factory (Shenchu) immediately to stop manufacturing and
selling game consoles with programmes which it ruled infringe Sega's
copyright.
Shenchu has also been ordered to deliver all offending games cards to the
government authority, and a fine of Yuan 30,000 (Pounds 2,270) has been
imposed.
Sega filed a suit against Shenchu in May and an investigation by Chinese
authorities found that 15 out of 20 games incorporated in Shenchu's machines
were identical to games developed and manufactured by Sega.
The investigation led the Chinese earlier this month to rule that Sega's
game cards should be protected as computer software under the country's
copyright laws. The latest move comes as China faces increasing
international pressure to enforce its copyright laws.
The US has urged the Chinese government to take action against audio and
video software pirates, and Beijing's willingness to pursue those who breach
copyright coincides with its campaign for readmission to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which it left more than 40 years ago.
Sega welcomed the Chinese decision which, it said, would be helpful in
considering whether or not to launch marketing operations in China, where
infringement of its copyright has been rampant.
While reluctant to market its games, the company already manufactures video
games consoles in China for export markets.

A battle over grain prices is growing between the Russian government and
farmers as this year's grain harvest draws to a close. Officials yesterday
forecast that the harvest would reach between 90m and 100m tonnes.
For the first time since the collectivisation of Russian agriculture, the
government is buying grain from its own producers at market rates rather
than at a state price.
But grain producers are balking at what they complain are prohibitively low
prices and warn that impoverished farms may be unable to bring in the
harvest in some regions.
Mr Nikolai Rybakov, a manager at Roskhlebprodukt, the state grain purchaser
which was transformed into a joint stock company, said yesterday that the
government had bought about 2m tonnes of grain so far, just half of the
amount bought by the end of August last year.
Roskhlebprodukt's granaries are not filling up because farmers are lobbying
to persuade the government to buy their grain at the 'indicative price' of
between 200,000 and 220,000 roubles (Dollars 93 and Dollars 102) a tonne
agreed by the regional government officials and producers in the spring. But
Roskhlebprodukt is, for the first time, trying to operate like a private
company.
'We look at the rates in regional commodities markets and then we decide
what price to pay farmers,' Mr Rybakov said. He said that Roskhlebprodukt
had been paying between 90,000 and 180,000 roubles a tonne of grain, 'but we
cannot pay farmers more than the world prices'.
Some regional authorities warn that Moscow's financial austerity could
jeopardise the harvest. Agriculture officials in the east of the country
said that because of a shortage of fuel and spare parts only 55 per cent of
the crop had been harvested.
But the Russian government, struggling to keep inflation in check, appears
determined to face down the farmers.
Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, warned farmers in central Russia
at the weekend that the state would not pay more than world prices for
grain. If farmers refused to sell at these prices, he cautioned, the
government 'is buried under more favourable offers from foreign grain
producers'.
His tough statements came two days after farmers demonstrated in Moscow to
protest at the government's 'criminal destruction of Russian agriculture'.

FT  30 AUG 94 / New York police fight to recycle rubbish on city streets

<TEXT>
'Look over there - another violation,' shouts sanitation police officer
Julius Ingram, wheeling his blue and white New York City police car into a
U-turn. 'Liquor bottles and loose boxes,' he pronounces with satisfaction.
That is the least of it. The pavement of this narrow road off West 211th
Street, high up in Manhattan's desolate northern tip, is covered with metal
shards and rotting fruit as well as discarded bottles. We are cruising the
back streets of Washington Heights and Inwood on dawn patrol to enforce the
city's tough and increasingly controversial laws on recycling rubbish.
Residents are now mounting a campaign against the vigilance of the city's
garbage police. Meanwhile, the city, worried about the rising costs of
recycling, has challenged a state Supreme Court order for it to double
present recycling levels.
Leaflets in English, Spanish and Chinese tell residents to tie all cardboard
and paper into bundles with string, and to put metal cans, glass and plastic
into pale blue plastic sacks. It seems a lot to ask of an unruly, largely
Spanish speaking district, packed with illegal immigrants from the Dominican
Republic and riddled with drug dealing.
But officer Ingram is undeterred. The grimy six-storey apartment block,
which bears a sign proclaiming 'Centre for International Aliens', has failed
to flatten its boxes correctly. Writing out a pink ticket for a Dollars 25
fine, he sticks it with masking tape to the door.
The recycling programme, in its fifth year in New York City's five boroughs,
has achieved more success than sceptics expected. Washington Heights, which
recycles nearly 10 per cent of its household rubbish, is only slightly below
the programme's average, but a world away from the 28 per cent in
Manhattan's elegant, environmentally concerned Upper East Side.
But overall the city's recycling falls far short of the 25 per cent target
for 1995 required by state law. The programme has provoked opposition from
residents who feel they are sometimes unfairly fined. It is also expensive,
although much of the annual budget - Dollars 78m (Pounds 50m) last year - is
passed on to residents through property taxes.
The underlying problem is that the city is running out of places to put its
rubbish. Districts to the north are reluctant to take the waste, as are
neighbouring states. 'No one wants New York's garbage,' says Ms Marsha
Bystryn, assistant commissioner of the city's recycling department. 'It's
like it came from Sodom and Gomorrah - who knows what might be in it.'

A great deal of nonsense has been talked about the new insider dealing rules
which came into force on March 1. The changes were introduced in order to
comply with a Brussels directive, not to improve the chances of securing
convictions for insider dealing. On the contrary, the authorities believe
that, if anything, they could make it more difficult.
Admittedly, the new rules have a broader scope and in theory appear severely
to restrict informal communications between companies and analysts. But,
whatever the letter of the law, the authorities have no interest in
preventing normal information flows. It is the cosy chats where analysts'
forecasts are steered down with a nudge and a wink that they want to stop
and these were banned under the old rules.
The scaremongering that accompanied the changes created some alarm and
confusion among companies. But the fact that their behaviour seems to have
changed little suggests that most were fairly careful about their
communications anyway. Most companies believe the new rules make their
investor relations more difficult but for those that remain worried about
the implications there is one simple rule: when in doubt put an announcement
out. Yet companies still seem to be shy of taking the obvious step of
issuing quarterly statements.

FT  30 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Building societies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyds bank shareholders, eagerly awaiting next week's interim figures from
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, should get further pointers from today's Alliance &amp;
Leicester numbers. Recent sector results have not been particularly
encouraging. Coventry, the 15th largest building society, last week reported
a fall in operating profits while Bristol &amp; West suffered a dip in income
which was barely offset by reduced administrative expenses.
Societies are under intense pressure in both the savings and mortgage
markets. After seeing a net outflow of savings in the first half the sector
had a better July helped by higher rates on longer term investments. But
competition from unit trusts and Peps remains fierce. On the other side of
the business, societies appear to have picked up market share from the banks
in July but net new commitments were down on the previous month and even the
optimists see only a slow and faltering recovery in mortgage demand.
The resulting squeeze in margins can only accelerate consolidation in the
sector. But the pressures are far from unbearable. As margins rose along
with bad debts in the recession, it is only to be expected that they should
fall in tandem now. With provisions tumbling, return on capital is healthy
and societies remain financially strong. C&amp;G, in particular, is prepared for
tough markets and, though its deposits are particularly footloose, that is
because it has already proved it can compete on price. As for its growth
prospects, they are still better than Lloyds', though that is not saying
much.

FT  30 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: UK corporate bonds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Among the many and varied financial instruments that the City can offer UK
companies there is one glaring omission: corporate bonds. Only the biggest
UK companies can issue bonds in the UK and they very rarely try. Instead
many turn to the US, where they can tap the publicly-traded markets or go
directly to a few institutions with a private placement. The latter is an
increasingly popular option for medium-sized British companies which are
looking for cheap, long-term, fixed-rate capital. In the US, small growing
businesses can also use the bond markets but it is not an option for their
counterparts in the UK.
It is not just companies that wish it were otherwise. The lack of a
corporate bond market was one of the concerns expressed by Mr Stephen
Dorrell, former financial secretary to the Treasury, in his review of
capital markets. This will only change if UK institutions rediscover a taste
for corporate bonds. Forty years ago the average pension fund portfolio was
invested 40 per cent in gilts and 10 per cent in corporate bonds. Now the
comparable figures are less than 10 per cent and next to nothing. The reason
is simple: the UK's awful post-war record on inflation ate away at the value
of fixed-interest holdings.
But with inflation down to 27-year lows, the optimists believe a UK
corporate bond market might reappear. It could be helped on its way if the
government further reduced the tax advantages of equities, though this would
be fiercely resisted by many in the City. Proposed changes to pension fund
solvency standards might provide another boost. But these are years away and
institutions might still worry about the liquidity of corporate bonds.
Index-linked gilts will remain a much safer alternative until it is clear
that inflation is tamed. For most fund managers that point is some way off.

FT  30 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Flotations at issue
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The surge in London share prices over the past two weeks has reinforced
expectations of a flood of equity issues after the summer lull. Flotations
scheduled for the autumn will be joined by several that were pulled when the
market faltered in the late spring. The rights issue flow will also restart,
prompting concerns that the market may suffer another bout of indigestion.
This looks alarmist. Institutional cash flows are healthy and while the
memory of this year's flops will make buyers more wary there is no reason to
suppose that solid, well-priced issues will have any trouble.
It is the international scene that is more difficult to judge. There is a
queue of multi-billion dollar privatisation issues in Europe and Asia,
including Lufthansa in Germany, Renault or AGF in France, Repsol in Spain,
Enel or Stet in Italy, Nordbanken in Sweden and possibly the Greek telephone
company OTE. The flotation of the Indian telecommunications group VSNL may
also be revived if it can fight its way through a crowd of other new issues.
Unless some are brought forward to take advantage of the current firm
markets the programme looks no heavier than earlier in the year. But one of
the props for recent issues, the wall of American money, may be weakening.
The hedge funds in particular, which had been big buyers, can no longer be
relied on. Governments, eager to balance their budgets by selling off state
assets, may have to work harder to attract domestic funds.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Gone but not forgotten: As Russian troops leave Germany -
Future relations between the two countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The last train to Moscow from the village of Wunsdorf, south of Berlin,
departs tomorrow, just as President Boris Yeltsin will be attending the
formal ceremonies in the German capital to mark the end of Russia's 49-year
military occupation of east Germany.
For the past week the village, hitherto headquarters of Moscow's so-called
western group of forces, its army of occupation in Germany, has almost
drowned in a tide of celebration and nostalgia. Vodka and champagne have
flowed as the departing Russian soldiers bade a tearful farewell to friends.
When the last Russian troops leave, the effects of their long stay in east
Germany will certainly not disappear. For a start, they are leaving behind
them, in Wunsdorf as on 250,000 hectares of other Soviet garrisons and
airfields, shooting ranges and waste dumps, an environmental nightmare:
untreated sewage, pools of toxic chemicals, oil and petrol, unexploded
shells, and abandoned equipment. The cost of the clean-up is still unknown.
Yet the environmental problems are not the real issue. For the departure of
the Russian troops ushers in a new era in German-Russian relations which
will remain for the foreseeable future both acutely sensitive, and central
to the lasting stability of the European continent.
For Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his government, as well as for the vast
majority of the German people, the highly visible and symbolic departure of
the Russians is a matter for whole-hearted enthusiasm. More than any other
event since the breaching of the Berlin Wall, this marks the end of the
second world war, and the return of a united Germany as a sovereign state.
Indeed, Mr Kohl is exploiting the event for all it is worth in his ambition
to be re-elected chancellor in October, presenting it as the ultimate
achievement of his government over the past four years.
For Mr Yeltsin, it is an altogether more problematic occasion. It emphasises
the retreat of Russia from its erstwhile empire, and it gives grist to the
mill of the nationalist lobby back in Moscow. He has to emerge looking
dignified, even in what many former Red Army officers see as a defeat.
It is a dilemma about which Mr Kohl is sensitive, even as he seeks to gain
all the votes he can garner from the television pictures of the departure.
In recent weeks the German government has embarked on a public relations
exercise aimed at reassuring the Russian people that the end of their
military occupation can only improve their bilateral and international
relations.
There is no doubt that the fear exists in Moscow that Bonn will mark the
Russian retreat either by downgrading its relations with its biggest eastern
partner, or by adopting a much less (financially) generous attitude towards
its yawning debt and development needs.
In an interview with Mr Kohl in Izvestia last Friday, Mr Sergei Sosnovsky of
the Interfax news agency suggested that 'there is a view that following the
withdrawal of the troops, the Germans will begin to speak a 'different
language' to the Russians, because the Russians will have lost their final
trump card in relations with Germany'.
'Those fears are groundless,' Mr Kohl retorted. 'Germans and Russians have
learned the lessons of history. Both sides have a vital interest in
promoting the cause of stability and peace on the continent through
far-reaching co-operation.'
It is certainly true that the whole direction of Germany's Ostpolitik - its
policy towards the east - since the demise of the Soviet Union, and its own
re-unification, has been aimed at the preservation of peace and stability on
its eastern border - and that has meant above all in the former Soviet
Union. This policy has underpinned Germany's diplomatic strategy, and its
financial contributions to the Russian economy in a host of ways.
'Germany is streets ahead of the entire international community (in terms of
its support for reform),' Mr Kohl told Izvestia. 'We did not do this just
because of the presence of Russian troops. Rather, we regard this
contribution as a good investment in a long-term relationship between
Germans and Russians.'
According to Deutsche Bank, traditionally the most heavily involved of the
German commercial banks in the former Soviet Union, the German banking
sector has outstanding loans to Russia of between Dollars 10bn and Dollars
12bn. That amounts to about 25 per cent of all the loans to the former
Soviet Union owed to western banks grouped in the London club of commercial
creditors.
In addition, Hermes, Germany's export credit insurance agency, has a total
exposure of about DM45.65bn, although it has cut back
on its business in Russia in the past three years, except for insurance
cover for east German exporters.
Bonn has also paid Moscow DM14.6bn to assist the withdrawal of Russian
troops from east Germany, primarily to pay for their rehousing back home. It
has also contributed an additional DM4.7bn in technical and humanitarian
assistance, and DM4.2bn for financing investment projects.
On the negative side, trade between the two countries has been declining
since 1990, and last year totalled DM22.1bn - one quarter of Russia's total
foreign trade, but only 2 per cent of Germany's.
As for the Ostpolitik, officials in Bonn are adamant that the troop
withdrawal will not change the basic direction of its foreign policy: to
promote stability across eastern Europe and, crucially, to reassure Russia
that its own security interests will not be threatened.
'It would be stupid for the Russians to think this will be changed,'
according to one senior German diplomat. 'Of course the symbolism of the
troops leaving east Germany is important. But the main plank of our foreign
policy towards Russia has been in place for some time, and we will continue
to pursue it.'
Again and again, Germany's foreign policy specialists stress the need to put
Moscow's own security fears at rest. 'Russia sees its security interests as
being under threat from eastern Europe, in the sense that Nato will be
extended to the borders of Russia, leaving Russia vulnerable,' the diplomat
said. 'That is why we, and our European Union partners, have had
painstakingly to explain to the governments of eastern Europe that we could
not bring them into the (Nato) Partnership for Peace programme without
including Russia.'
The counterpart to that policy of reassuring Russia is to dampen the
expectations of the central and east Europeans, including the now
independent Baltic republics.
'We are trying to explain to them why they must not block out Russia,' the
diplomat said. 'It is too dangerous. They must establish new relations with
Russia because an eastern Europe which is perceived to be hostile by Moscow
could play into the hands of the nationalists and lead to instability.
Russia lost eastern Europe. It now needs a new relationship with eastern
Europe in order to come to terms with the west expanding towards its
borders.' When Finland joins the EU next January, the EU will itself have a
Russian frontier.
Bonn believes that Moscow understands the importance of the bilateral
relationship, and will itself try to preserve it. It wants the German
government to continue to act as a sober, moderating voice in international
organisations, allowing Russia to pursue its interests.
'Those interests are becoming clearer,' said another German diplomat. 'I
believe Russia is pursuing a sober, if not cynical, strategy. It wants to be
the first among the former Soviet republics to get on its feet.' Bonn is
prepared to back that self-interested strategy, not least because German
officials are haunted by a nightmare. That is the danger of big differences
between the rate of economic growth in different parts of eastern Europe,
leading to a backlash against the slow pace of reforms in some of them.
'They could be drawn back again into the former Soviet Union. In such a
scenario we should not exclude the prospect of a new military-type Warsaw
Pact Two emerging,' the diplomat said.
That is the concern which will temper too much triumphalism tomorrow on the
streets of Berlin when President Yeltsin comes to bid farewell.

Head suitably naked, Observer rang in search of a translation. Just what did

FT  30 AUG 94 / Observer: President who?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is just a year from the presidential elections in Poland, and the present
incumbent Lech Walesa is growing restless. The opinion polls make gloomy
reading, so Walesa has gone in search of scapegoats.
The first casualty seems to be his faithful press spokesman Andrzej
Drzycimski, who has been dispatched on 'extended holiday'. Francis Cybula,
the president's chaplain and confessor since his days as a youthful trade
union leader, is also not expected to survive.
In the meantime, Walesa seems to reckon he can do better himself - at least
in the former capacity. Last week he dialed The Wprost with his personal
denial of a report carried in the weekly newspaper alleging he kept a number
of foreign bank accounts.
Understandably, the telephonist did not immediately twig as to the caller's
identity, and connected him with the sadly incomplete introduction: 'There's
a president on the phone.'
A flustered newsman attempted to explain away the confusion. 'All sorts
phone up giving themselves false titles to attract attention.'

FT  30 AUG 94 / Observer: Soft landing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
So Stephen Wolf is really grounded for good. The man who last month quit as
boss of United Airlines when employees took the controls has wasted no time
in finding a new slot. But, his 28 years in the airline business
notwithstanding, it is Wall Street and Lazard Freres where he is poised to
land.
The airline industry is the primary loser, for Wolf had immense experience.
After a low-key start with a sociology degree from San Francisco State
University, he was soon winging his way upwards, initially with American
Airlines.
By the time he joined United in 1987, he had seen the insides of Pan Am,
Continental, Republic and Tiger International (parent of The Flying Tiger
Line).
It was his success at brow beating the unions that made his departure from
United an inevitability, once the workers took control.
But, precisely as a turnaround artist able to wring concessions from
employees, Wolf, 53, will no doubt earn his keep as a senior adviser with
Lazard. His advice on mergers, acquisitions and restructurings will be
founded on something more than business school case studies.
At his new stable, he has a close personal friend in Ira Harris, the partner
heading the Chicago office. And the firm obviously passed muster on a
professional basis when it advised Wolf and United in the course of the
buy-out negotiations with the unions.

City headhunters take note. Officials at Lehman Brothers have dispensed with
the highly-priced services of the middle man and are letting their own
fingers do the walking.
The investment bank has recently lost its chief international economist to
the Institute for Public Policy Research and its UK economist to ITN. So its
sales people were put up to polling clients in search of their favourite
practitioners of the dismal science.
Doesn't sound a bad way to proceed. After all the customer's always right.

Daniel Goeudevert, last heard slamming Volkswagen's back door a year ago
after being booted off the group board, has popped up at the side of
would-be German chancellor Rudolf Scharping.
The 52-year-old Frenchman yesterday became the Social Democrat leader's
personal adviser on Franco-German affairs, part of a series of changes
designed to inject some verve into the diffident Scharping's election
campaign.
A thoughtful, literary type who fell foul of VW boss Ferdinand Piech,
Goeudevert has in the interim been convalescing quietly on a DM4m
'consultancy fee' from the company.
He has been padding out what he describes as 'this vacuum, this emptiness'
as vice-president of the International Green Cross, an environmentalist
group based in Geneva.
Reputed for his impeccable intellectual honesty - he earnestly promoted
sound ecological and ethical business practices before most of his former
motor industry colleagues had even heard of them - Goeudevert is a handsome
embellishment to Scharping's team.
But he will have to look right and left as Gerhard Schroder, the
power-hungry prime minister of Lower Saxony who becomes the new 'super'
shadow minister, sets about trying to help the SPD get elected.
For Goeudevert and Schroder were last seen hurtling down the Autobahn in
opposite directions. The man most likely to oust Scharping if he fluffs it,
Schroder is also the spokesman for Lower Saxony's controlling minority stake
in VW. From his perch on the car-maker's supervisory board, he provided
indispensable support for Piech's campaign to send Goeudevert into the
wilderness.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Latecomers, time's up: An appointment is a contract which is
breached by unpunctuality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If I was given the opportunity to expunge a single human vice, it would be
unpunctuality. Vice is not too strong a word for it. We are talking here
about something that is selfish, damaging and - since this is a business
newspaper - expensive. And there are few vices that can claim to be all
three.
That may sound a bit strong, coming from a member of a profession which is
notorious for its inability to keep appointments. But even journalists know
the value of punctuality. There would not be much in today's newspaper if
they did not.
The world divides into people who are punctual and those who are not, and
the gulf between them is gapingly wide. Speaking as a member of the first
group, I can explain why I resent unpunctuality, but I can only make a
biased guess at what goes on in the mind of a habitually unpunctual person.
Punctual people find it impossible to understand how anyone can bear to be
late - how, indeed, anyone can imagine that there is any alternative to
arriving on time, other, perhaps, than arriving five minutes early. They are
probably born that way. That would explain the rush of anger they feel at
other people's lateness. But let us try to rationalise this feeling for a
moment.
Punctuality is partly about manners. It is rude to turn up late because it
inconveniences the person you are meeting. An appointment is a form of
contract which is breached by unpunctuality. And it is a particularly
personal form of contract because it involves the physical presence of both
parties. The argument that punctuality is essentially a social virtue is
reinforced rather than weakened by the fact that some nations consist
entirely of unpunctual people. In countries where it is customary to turn up
half an hour late, the code still exists; it merely has 30 minutes built
into it.
But punctuality is also about order and economy, both of which make the
world go round. Unpunctuality is about anarchy and waste, which are
destructive. Unpunctuality is also corrosive. It destroys punctual habits in
other people - as in the case of regular meetings which always start late
because a few people persistently fail to show up on time. Eventually,
everyone rolls up late.
Part of the resentment that punctual people feel stems, I think, from the
sense of injustice that unpunctuality creates. If punctual people believe
that civil behaviour demands that people arrive on time, the same code
obliges them to deal civilly with late arrivals, no matter how strongly they
resent them.
Thus:
Scene: Two punctual people, A and B, sitting at a meeting table, waiting for
third person, C.
A: (looking at watch): 'He's a quarter of an hour late.'
B: 'Shall we start without him?'
A: 'Give him five more minutes.'
Enter C in a flurry of lateness.
C: 'Gosh I'm sorry I'm so late.'
A and B (in unison): 'Not at all. Difficult morning?'
C: 'Terrible. Been waiting long?'
A: 'No, only a few minutes.'
This scene illustrates two things. One is that unpunctual behaviour
triumphs. The other is that the unpunctual person is never made fully aware
of the inconvenience he has caused. He therefore never corrects his fault.
There is nothing to be lost from being unpunctual.
Unpunctual people seldom think of themselves as such. Insofar as I can
understand them, they seem to think that punctuality is a sign of pettiness,
of warped values. They have trouble linking it with notions of selfishness
or anti-social behaviour.
People will doubtless resent the moral-sounding tone of this article.
Unfortunately, the punctual habit brings no sense of righteousness, no moral
glow. It is in many ways a curse: it condemns you to a lifetime of anxiety,
to a gut-tightening dread of delay - all overlaid by the sense of
frustration I have already alluded to.
Maybe punctual people are at fault for not dealing more severely with late
people. Their tolerance prevents a kind of Darwinian process from breeding
out the unpunctual habit. What society needs is a sanction which penalises
unpunctuality. But it is not easy. Unpunctual people have little sense of
shame, and they can usually judge how strongly their presence is required.
Therefore there is no point in being forthright with them, or in trying to
shut them out.
The answer must lie in inconveniencing latecomers in some way, to irritate
them or make them feel excluded: such as removing all empty chairs from a
meeting room at the appointed time. I'm sure there's scope for some
constructive suggestions here.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Leading Article: The prize of Mideast peace
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is still too early to be fully confident that the Middle East peace
process is irreversible, but timely to assert that the prize is now almost
within the participants' grasp. The symbolism of the Madrid conference in
1991, the handshakes between Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister of Israel,
first with Mr Yassir Arafat of the PLO, and more recently with King Hussein
of Jordan, could be greeted with scepticism for so long as there were no
tangible changes on the ground. But those changes are now happening.
Israeli troops have withdrawn from a small part of occupied territory, and
Israel is handing over important civil powers to a Palestinian authority. Mr
Arafat is back on home soil, backed by substantial pledges of international
aid. Tourists are already taking advantage of the new border crossing
between Israel and Jordan. King Hussein's embattled economy will soon begin
to benefit from debt forgiveness of as much as Dollars 2bn over the next
three years. Plans are being laid for roads linking Jordan and Israel and
schemes for sharing electricity, airports and port facilities. Populations
may not yet feel the benefits, but governments can begin to see the
dividends of peace.
The desire to realise those dividends should provide the strongest incentive
for maintaining the momentum among those leaders already committed to the
peace process. Mr Rabin, Mr Arafat and King Hussein find themselves in the
same boat, albeit not yet rowing in precisely the same direction. They need
the process to succeed for the overwhelming reason that personal, party and
dynastic futures may depend on it. They are aware equally that the lack of
an agreement between Israel and Syria could threaten further progress and,
at worst, undermine what has already been achieved.
High ground
Mr Rabin's calculations over the next few months will be crucial. He holds
the high ground - literally on the Golan heights and politically at home
where the most hawkish elements of opposition are in increasing disarray. Mr
Rabin and the Israeli public know the price demanded by Syria, which is an
eventual full withdrawal from the Golan. The timing and terms of that
withdrawal, through which Israel can be reassured of Syria's long-term
commitment to peace, are at the heart of US mediation efforts. The gap is
narrowing, must be bridgeable, and if closed would not just inject a new
surge of optimism into the peace process but would encourage the belief that
other apparently irreconcilable issues, such as the future status of
Jerusalem, might one day be resolved.
Old sureties
The clock is also ticking for President Hafez al-Assad in Damascus. The old
sureties, such as the support of Moscow, have gone. King Hussein has set his
own agenda, without reference to Syria. Improved relations with Washington
will not bear much-needed economic fruit for Syria until there is progress
in the negotiations with Israel. Mr Assad may have crushed Islamic forces at
home, but he is riding the Hizbollah tiger in southern Lebanon which could
yet cause him severe embarrassment. To enhance the prospects of the Alawite
minority's maintaining its dominance after his departure, Mr Assad needs to
bequeath a more stable future than a continuing, debilitating conflict with
Israel.
In Syria, as in Egypt, Jordan, liberated Palestine, the occupied
territories, Lebanon, and Israel, the most vigorous opponents of the
compromises needed to secure peace are also those who would expect to
benefit most politically from the failure of the present process. The closer
peace comes, the more desperate and dangerous those forces will become, as
recent bombs in London and Buenos Aires have shown. The proper response must
be greater vigilance, restraint (especially by Israel), and more emphatic
efforts to eradicate the conditions which breed such extremism: occupation,
poverty, and the absence of hope for a better future. The next steps are
clearly signposted. Israel must speedily complete its withdrawal from most
of the West Bank, and Mr Arafat should stop complaining about the
conditionality of aid and use what is available as rapidly and effectively
as possible. If at the same time the US steps up its efforts to broker a
deal between Israel and Syria, the prize will be truly within reach.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Venturing capital
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A cornucopia of special incentives exists to encourage savings here and
promote investments there. Splendid as job-promoting schemes for tax
inspectors, accountants and investment advisors, this host of schemes is
impossible to justify. That is true even of the almost universally lauded
desire to provide special help to small business.
Two justifications can be advanced for offering special incentives to small
companies. First, small business finds it difficult to raise money because
investors face obstacles in identifying honestly-run companies with good
prospects, in monitoring their behaviour and in realising investments. This
may justify efforts to subsidise information. But subsidising particular
investments mainly increases tax avoidance.
A second argument is that high rates of capital gains tax (up to 40 per
cent) in the current tax system discriminate against investment in small
enterprises. Given corporation tax, CGT entails the double-taxation of
retained earnings. Since growth in the value of small enterprises partly
depends on rapid accumulation of retained earnings, this may raise an
obstacle to investment in such enterprises. Mr Clarke's unfortunate decision
to eliminate indexation of capital losses in the 1993 Budget further reduces
the attraction of investment in the small business lottery, where investors
hope that a few big winners will offset their many losers.
Poor measures
The first of these arguments is far from overwhelming, while the second
concerns capital gains taxation in general, not small business promotion in
particular. It is difficult, therefore, to be enthusiastic about the special
measures announced by the chancellor of the exchequer last November.
At that time, capital gains tax roll-over relief for profits reinvested in
private companies was broadened. In addition, the Enterprise Investment
Scheme was introduced as an alternative to the Business Expansion Scheme,
which had been hi-jacked by property investments. Being less generous and
better focused, the new scheme should be less wasteful.
Legislation is now being drawn up for a third vehicle, the venture capital
investment trusts. The Inland Revenue views these as riskier versions of
personal equity plans, with similar tax exemption of dividends and capital
gains. Because the trusts will have relatively liquid publicly quoted
shares, the Revenue does not appear to favour up-front tax relief, even at
the 20 per cent level allowed in the EIS scheme. The Revenue is also
proposing to limit venture capital trust investment in any company to Pounds
1m. Since the fewer the special incentives the better, hats go off to the
Revenue.
Extensive lobbying
Inevitably, there has been a cacophony of lobbying for changes. The loudest
has come from the Association of Investment Trust Companies, which says its
members are unlikely to launch new trusts unless the maximum investment
limit is raised. Investing in lumps much smaller than Pounds 3m would be too
demanding on management time and render the trusts unviable, it argues.
This should be ignored. Venture capital institutions, such as 3i, adequately
meet the demand for larger deals. Setting the limit near Pounds 3m would
also deny many of the smaller companies the seed capital venture capital
trusts are being set up to provide. Investments in smaller companies, those
most likely to be curtailed by lack of information, are the ones that most
deserve help.
One area where something might be done is to extend CGT roll-over relief to
capital gains reinvested in venture capital trusts. But this is mere
tinkering with the problem. What is needed is to make roll-over relief
generally available. By restricting CGT to ultimate disposals, this would
limit its effect on people's ability to trade assets and move the system
towards expenditure taxation.
Greater fiscal generosity would, of course, generate more investment in
small enterprises. But that in itself cannot be a sane objective. What
matters is to promote economically productive investment. The way to be more
confident that this is occurring is to stop producing one clever wheeze
after another and develop coherent reform of the taxation of savings and
investment.

<TEXT>
Sir, As leader of Macclesfield Borough Council, the 25th largest shire
district in England, I know that the establishment of a unitary council in
our area would be of great benefit to our residents and businesses. This
view is shared not only by the council but also by our local business
community, led by large employers such as Zeneca and Ciba, both of which
have their headquarters in the Borough of Macclesfield.
Macclesfield has a population of more than 151,000, as big as many
metropolitan districts. Unlike them, though, we do not control the majority
of decisions affecting our area as 90 per cent of our council tax goes
straight into Cheshire County Council's coffers.
The two-tier system is an anachronism which only serves to frustrate
efficient and responsive local government. The proposal of the Local
Government Commission to create five unitaries in Cheshire should be warmly
welcomed as the opportunity to free us from the unnecessary and costly
bureaucracy.

Sir, Your editorial stance on the local government review in England is well
rehearsed.
However, I must correct an error in your leader. The commission has not
conducted 'postal referendums'. We are sending leaflets to 12m households as
part of an unprecedented public consultation exercise and, on the returns so
far, we expect to receive 1m individual responses. (The Royal Commission on
Local Government in England, which in the 1960s studied local government for
three years, received the views of 600 individuals in all.)
All views submitted to us, together with the other factors we have to
consider, will be taken into account before we send our final
recommendations to the secretary of state for the environment later this
year. We are not returning officers in a plebiscite - but public opinion,
measured in a variety of ways, will of course be important.

Sir, Your editorial demands a response. The review is about improving local
government. It seeks to create councils that serve district communities,
overcome the widespread confusion about which tier of local government does
what, and ideally produce savings in the process.
That unitary authorities will overcome confusion is irrefutable. The Local
Government Commission itself calculates that significant savings will often
be possible. And, in Buckinghamshire, like many other areas, there is
overwhelming support for change.
The review must, therefore, be completed.

<TEXT>
Sir, In response to your editorial, 'England's local shambles' (August 25),
the two-tier structure of local government has not worked well in most of
shire England in spite of good members and officers at both county and
district councils. The public is confused, accountability is poor and
services that ought to be integrated are split between two authorities.
The public overwhelmingly contacts its local council yet its county council
spends 70 per cent of the finance and is unavoidably remote, given its size.
District councils know that the Local Government Review will lead to their
abolition as well as that of their county council. In spite of this, most of
them back a unitary system as long as it is kept local to the people they
serve.
For these reasons all three national political parties pledged to introduce
unitary local government in their manifestos. It has happened in
metropolitan England and is about to in Wales, Scotland and most of shire
England.

FT  30 AUG 94 / The FT Interview: TV thriller, back after the break - Barry
Diller, chariman of QVC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barry Diller is saying No at the moment, frequently and clearly. In the past
18 months, entertainment executive Mr Diller has invested in an obscure
US-based home shopping television channel called QVC and made nearly Dollars
100m. He has also failed to take over Paramount (the Hollywood studio) and
has proved unable to make a merger with CBS (the US broadcaster) stick after
a big QVC shareholder objected to the deal. Now, seeing no role for himself
at QVC, he is about to be out of a job.
Employment offers and ideas for possible deals are coming in fast and Mr
Diller - for now - is saying No to them all. 'Things come up but I am trying
to push opportunity away from me for at least a few months,' he says.
He was being interviewed at at the Edinburgh Television Festival at the
weekend - somewhere he would have preferred not to be, but he had promised
to make a speech so he turned up. For the previous 10 days, Mr Diller, one
of the most frenetic and forceful executives in the entertainment industry,
took himself off to a beach house in California and put his career on hold.
'I want to . . . really learn from what I have just gone through,' says Mr
Diller. 'The world has heard enough from me for a while. I want off stage. I
want out of the light.'
The reflective mood is striking from a man who has known little but success
 -from creating the 'Movie of the Week' concept on US television as a young
executive in the industry, to running Paramount for 10 years, to launching
the Fox Television network in the US for Mr Rupert Murdoch. Now he has to
come to terms with failure.
'While I have all the explanations in the world and I have learned a great
deal, the fact of the matter is I did try to buy Paramount and in the end
didn't, and I did merge with CBS and it got stopped and that's that,' says
Mr Diller.
He was more succinct in his first comments after the Paramount failure
earlier this year. 'They won. We lost. Next]' he said then. But now Mr
Diller feels that after a second blow - the loss of the CBS deal - it is not
going to be so simple to move on.
In particular, he feels he has to learn the lessons of the bruising
experience of being involved in his first large-scale, hostile takeover.
'While I had been around Wall Street, I didn't really know anything about it
 -about real playing and that kind of big-ticket investment banking and the
arbitrageurs,' Mr Diller concedes.
The 52-year-old executive, whose initial Dollars 25m stake in QVC has risen
in value over the last 18 months to Dollars 118m, insists he could have bid
high enough to take Paramount from Mr Sumner Redstone's Viacom broadcasting
group, whose interests include the MTV channel. He simply refused to pay
what he regarded as too high a price.
'I just looked at the assets and knew it wildly wasn't worth it,' says Mr
Diller. He says he turned down, as too risky, a proposal to raise extra
money by borrowing against QVC's future share price - which he would have
had to guarantee.
But the real turning point, he says, came in a meeting with 15 arbitrageurs
who at the time held 30 per cent of Paramount. Mr Diller started to tell
them about his plans for Paramount, but that was not what they were
interested in. He remembers one saying to him: 'Stop talking to us. We don't
want to hear your ideas. Give us a nickel more and we will all go home' -
although, with Paramount's stock price then bouncing above Dollars 90 a
share, the 5 cents was probably only a figure of speech.
'I am quite happy I didn't do it (Paramount). I am not happy with the CBS
proposition,' says Mr Diller, referring to his subsequent attempt to merge
with the television network in a deal that would have gone a long way
towards fulfilling his ambition to run a big media concern.
The main problem was that Mr Ralph Roberts, chairman of Comcast, a minority
QVC shareholder, did not think a cable company such as his should be
tangling with a network broadcaster. Mr Diller told Comcast that, if it
wanted to stop the deal, it could always buy QVC. Mr Diller says he promised
that, if it did, he would treat its bid with respect. 'They (Comcast) did.
We did. Larry Tisch (chairman of CBS) walked out. It was over.
Instantaneous,' says Mr Diller, in his best machine-gun delivery. Comcast
was joined in taking over QVC by Liberty Media, another cable company.
In his Edinburgh speech, Mr Diller managed to sum up his recent experiences
with a measure of wit. With tongue firmly in cheek, he explained he was
still secretly working for Mr Murdoch, and had been enormously successful in
undermining the balance sheets of two major rivals, Paramount and Viacom.
Getting into his stride, Mr Diller suggested in his lecture that he was
'clearly a tonic' to 'old men' in the US media industry. 'Sumner Redstone,
Larry Tisch, Ralph Roberts . . . are all in their 70s, and there is no-one
who can't say they haven't been rejuvenated by having me briefly in their
lives,' Mr Diller said.
Whose life Mr Diller will rejuvenate next is likely to remain uncertain for
some time, but he has dropped two large hints about his intentions.
First, he suggests that in the future he wants to be in overall charge of
any project. He left Fox three years ago after telling Mr Murdoch that he
wanted to be a principal and own stock in The News Corporation. Mr Murdoch
said there could only be one principal in the group - himself.
'Will I or will I not work with other people?' Mr Diller asks. 'I will, or I
won't . . . But one thing I doubt that I will ever do: I just don't think I
will get myself in a situation where I can't prevail.'
The second clue lies in his continuing interest in 'the truly radical
transformation' taking place in the media industries. After leaving Fox he
spent 10 months searching for a chance to exploit an undiscovered investment
opportunity which ended, to the surprise of many, at QVC. He saw what no one
else saw in a company that sold cheap jewellery and electronics to the US
television viewer 24 hours a day - that it represented the convergence of
technology that most people were only talking about. QVC uses television to
stimulate consumers' interest, telecommunications to take 130,000 calls a
day (and sometimes as many as 300,000), and computers to organise it all and
handle the inventory and make sure goods get to customers on time. But QVC,
where Mr Diller is contractually obliged to remain as chairman until
December, has already begun to develop what he regards as a more powerful
idea - 'smart agent technology'. This, Mr Diller explained to his audience
in Edinburgh, would involve creating detailed computer profiles of the
tastes and desires of individual consumers and matching the information with
goods, services and information that they are likely to want. Developing
such databases, he believes, will be a more effective way of trying to merge
media industries and change how people behave than Hollywood studios,
publishers and telephone companies trying to invade each other's territories
without really knowing what they are doing.
Given Mr Diller's current enthusiasm for the project it would be surprising
if 'smart agents' did not pop up somewhere in his future plans - unless his
period of reflection produces an even smarter idea.
For now, Mr Diller will not be precise about his intentions. Apart from
lying as low as possible to see what he can create from his experiences, Mr
Diller is emphatic about only one thing: 'I don't know what I am going to
make of it (his experience) but I hope I won't do the obvious.'

FT  30 AUG 94 / Cheap ride on trial: Proposals to close loopholes in the
UK's legal aid system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The spectacle of apparently wealthy people being granted legal aid to fight
UK court cases and then running up bills of thousands, if not millions, of
pounds to be met from the public purse is sparking controversy inside, as
well as outside, the legal profession.
Last week the Law Society, the UK's professional body for solicitors,
proposed ways of closing loopholes in legal aid rules enabling the wealthy
to claim state support.
Its move follows a number of controversial cases, notably that of Dr Jawad
Hashim, the Iraqi businessman who, despite owning six luxury homes, has so
far received Pounds 4m in legal aid for his civil court battle with his
former employer, the Arab Monetary Fund, economic watchdog for the Arab
League. The AMF successfully claimed Dr Hashim embezzled Pounds 33m
belonging to the fund.
The government's Benefits Agency, which assesses legal aid claims,
disregards disputed assets when deciding if applicants need financial help -
and the size of the AMF's claim against Dr Hashim meant most of his assets
were disputed.
Legal aid given to many of the City's fallen heroes in criminal cases has
also provoked criticism. Where they have been declared bankrupt - though
their lifestyle may be supported by friends or relations - they have
qualified for legal aid.
Given the size and complexity of many fraud trials, the sums involved can be
large. At the weekend, legal aid in the trial of Roger Levitt the financier
sentenced to 180-hours of community service for fraudulent trading, plus
three co-defendants, was confirmed by government law officers as having
exceeded Pounds 2m.
Mr Wallace Duncan Smith, the former City banker jailed for fraud this year,
set a record for the amount of public money spent simply on accountants for
his defence - Pounds 350,000.
The trial of Kevin and Ian Maxwell, scheduled for early next year, looks
likely to produce a total legal aid bill running into seven figures.
Defence lawyers insist defendants in criminal trials have to be given the
resources to prepare their cases - and that bankrupt bankers should be
treated in the same way as the less well off. They add that because a
personal contribution is often demanded even when legal aid is granted, the
system is not a 'free ride'.
But such arguments are hard to sustain amid the controversy over recent cuts
at the other end of the legal aid spectrum. Anxious to control the fast
growing legal aid budget - expected to increase by 15 per cent to Pounds
1.4bn this year - Lord McKay, the Lord Chancellor, has restricted
eligibility for some of the poorest applicants, leaving many, say his
critics, without access to the law.
Cuts have fallen hardest on the 'green form' scheme which provides two hours
of free legal advice for relatively straightforward civil cases such as
family disputes - the type of action in which those on low incomes are most
likely to be involved. While people earning up to Pounds 145 a week used to
be able to use the scheme, that limit has been cut to Pounds 70.
Mr Russell Wallman, head of professional policy at the Law society, says the
contrasting treatment of the poorest applicants and the apparently wealthy
makes legal aid arrangements seem a 'racket'. Mr Charles Elly, Law Society
president, says: 'Government cuts have meant that many people living only
just above the poverty line are no longer able to afford legal aid. That
makes it particularly galling to see many apparently wealthy individuals
getting legal aid through loopholes in the rules.'
The society suggests the legal aid system should be reformed to take more
account of applicants' lifestyles, and increase pressure on the seemingly
affluent to explain all income sources. Mr Wallman suggests those relying on
wealthy relatives and friends should have to use some of these resources to
fund their legal costs. Implementing this approach, he says, would not be
easy. Could a friend who, for example, takes an applicant to a restaurant be
expected also to pay his legal bills? But in principle it would be no less
harsh than denying legal aid to those falling just outside the current
eligibility limits.
A more practical measure proposed by the Law Society, which could be
implemented fairly quickly, is to take account of the value of applicants'
homes when assessing their eligibility. The society does not suggest people
should have to vacate modest homes to fund litigation. But it does not see
why someone with substantial equity in a home should not have that taken
into account.
The society suggests a ceiling on the amount of equity that should be
disregarded - perhaps in the range of Pounds 100,000-Pounds 150,000. 'If
that means somebody has to move somewhere more modest, I don't think that is
unreasonable,' says Mr Wallman.
In civil actions, as in the Hashim case, the Law Society says it should be
possible for legal fees to be paid out of the funds at stake. This would
reverse the practice of disregarding disputed assets. The society also urges
the courts to make standard the practice of releasing money to pay legal
fees when imposing freezing orders on assets.
The society argues the financial savings via its proposals could be
significant, even though the number of applicants affected would be in the
hundreds or low thousands. 'The money saved would be in the tens, rather
than hundreds, of millions of pounds,' says Mr Wallman. Such sums could help
many applicants at the bottom of the income scale.
The Law Society's proposals have been submitted to the Lord Chancellor.
Though the society has clashed with Lord McKay over the latter's attempts to
curb the legal aid budget, there are signs that their thinking is now more
in line: law officers have hinted in Parliament they see the case for
reforming legal aid rules affecting the better off.
For the government, anxious to control public spending, the Law Society's
proposals have one big attraction: ending the controversy over payouts to
the well-off would make it politically easier to curb growth in the overall
legal aid budget.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Buccaneers, but not pirates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr W J W COURTNEY.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The emotive language of your article, 'Boards of utilities likened to
pirates' (August 25) calls for an immediate response.
Sir Anthony Beaumont-Dark, chairman of TR High Income Trust, casts a wide
net when describing directors of all water companies as giving themselves
huge increases in pay and pillaging their companies.
Let me set the record straight so far as Southern Water - a company in which
TR High Income Trust wisely seeks to invest - is concerned.
The majority of Southern Water's directors were recruited from the private
sector. The prospectus for the sale of our shares in 1989 clearly stated
that directors' salaries would be brought up to levels commensurate with
those in the private sector. Some five years on, our advice from independent
consultants is that these levels are still to be achieved.
We do not just control a monopoly. We operate a water business within a
highly complex regulatory framework and remain accountable to a myriad
price, quality and environmental regulators. We are responsible for managing
a capital investment programme of some Pounds 2bn to bring up to the latest
UK and EU standards our Victorian infrastructure legacy which, until
recently, was neglected by politicians of all complexions.
At the same time, we have formed or acquired some 20 trading companies which
are exposed to the full rigours of competition in the market place. Through
these successful businesses we have, each year, added value for our
shareholders and created employment during a period of recession. Fifty per
cent of our total board costs are met by these non-regulated businesses.
Buccaneers we may be in developing new businesses, but pirating our core
business - never.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Baccalaureate offers more depth and
flexibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From CHRISTIAN FAVRE.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, With reference to your editorial, 'A-levels fail the test of time'
(August 22), any unbiased observer must agree that specialising in three
subjects at the age of 16 is detrimental to a student's development and, in
the long run, to the nation's economy.
However, the alternative you propose, five A-levels, with a 20 per cent
lighter syllabus, is only a partial solution. Scientifically-inclined
students would tend to take only maths and science subjects, while the
others would tend to take only arts subjects and languages. This system
would thus run the danger of producing a large number of what is known in
German as 'Fachidioten'.
Surely it would be preferable to introduce a system similar to that of the
International Baccalaureate: students must sit six exams, English (in
English-medium schools) and maths are compulsory as are one science subject,
one arts subject (for example, history or economics), and one foreign
language. The sixth subject may be chosen from any of these groups. In
addition, students may, if they wish, take a seventh or even an eighth
subject, and a class in epistemology and an 'extended essay' are also
compulsory. This system has the merit of striking a good balance between a
broadly-based and an in-depth education while at the same time allowing a
good deal of flexibility.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Arts: Abstract virtues - Two London shows celebrate a side
of British art which has never been fully appreciated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once invented, abstraction was never going to go away. Rather like the
wheel, it was just too useful. It made life so much more simple and
straight-forward. Other preoccupations come and go, conceptualism may
command our critical attention for a while, post-modernism may shoot across
the skies, figuration may be apparently revived; yet always, there will be
serious artists making abstract paintings. Speculation about the death of
abstraction will always be loose talk.
But it is one thing to continue active, quite another to remain important.
Is the currency of abstract painting, beyond the mere fact of its survival,
worthy of our critical attention? On present evidence the answer is clearly
yes.
The paradox of abstract painting, is that the apparent simplicity of choice
presents the artist with real difficulties. The external references by which
the figurative artist persuades us of his merit may be absent - and the
abstract painter may not relish them - but the underlying constraints common
to all painting remain.
Order, structure, colour, form and surface, light and space, are there as
ever to tease and confound him, and all the more so by the fact that he has
brought them on himself. A single stroke of paint laid upon the bare canvas
will conjure up a visual space that extends within and beyond that
surface-plane as far as the imagination will take it. Each further mark will
qualify and elaborate that space, each colour hold itself in its particular
spatial and formal relation to the next and to the painting as a whole. The
paint itself must be manipulated and controlled, the painted surface
sustained in its entirety: and the eye must be held here and shifted there
through the whole complex and subtle course of the work.
The show at Flowers East, which fills the galleries on both sides of the
road, is of particular interest not just for representing so many of the
most important of our abstract painters, but for doing so by recent and
substantial examples of their work. It is a generous survey, an effective
collaboration between a number of London's principal galleries and burdened
by no narrower principal than the quality of the work. Alongside the
ebullient and expansive expressionism of Albert Irvin and Patrick Heron, or
the heavy calligraphic figures of John Hoyland, or the dense impastos of
Gillian Ayres and Alan Gouk, are set the quietist near-minimalism of Edwina
Leapman's grey stripes, or Ian Tyson's sparely stated rectangle in blue and
white, or Trevor Sutton's exquisitely worked orange square set in a red
disc.
There are any number of beautiful things - from Noel Forster, Prunella
Clough, Sean Scully, Carol Robertson, Alan Green, Clyde Hopkins, Sandra
Blow, John McLean, Michael Ginsborg. There are no duds. As for omissions, I
think of Barry Cooke, Peter Joseph, John Hubbard - but it is a measure of
the show's success that they are few. The new Richard Smith is a treat, for
apart from a small show at Feigen in the summer, he has been seldom seen in
London in recent years. Overall this is an exhibition of museum standing,
which one of our vaunted public institutions might have put on and toured
abroad, had it had the nerve or wit. Almost as much may be said of the show,
from the collection of Robert Loder, that has come to Atlantis from the Bede
Gallery at Jarrow. It has a more historic dimension, going back to the
1960s, and a more personal and miscellaneous character, with one or two
artists such as Hoyland, McLean and the late Brian Fielding being well
represented.
The contemporaneity of the Flowers show gives it a more immediate relevance,
but that at Atlantis is none the less worth seeing. Together they celebrate
a quality in British art that we have never fully appreciated, let alone
celebrated properly ourselves. Were we really so much in awe of American and
Continental abstraction all those years ago that we could not see what was
under our noses? Technical probity, imaginative authority and a manifest
lack of histrionics and self-indulgence: such virtues shine out in a naughty
world, yet here they are commonplace.
British Abstract Painting: Flowers East, 199 &amp; 282 Richmond Road, Hackney
E8, until September 11. Lead and Follow - the Continuity of Abstraction:
Atlantis Galleries, 146 Brick Lane, Whitechapel E1, until September 11.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Arts: MTV lends an ear to the baby boomers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER ASPDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Hope I die before I get old' ran the too-often quoted line, 'gotta leave a
good-looking corpse' urged another; but nobody actually meant it. Rock music
has not only come of age, it is staring at its sagging jowls in the mirror
every morning and preparing to apply for its free bus pass. And yet, the
myths of teenage fervour and adolescent yearning die hard.
'Rock music is part of the passion of being young,' explains Bill Roedy,
president of MTV Networks Europe, and he should know; the 24-hour music
channel reaches 60 million households in 33 countries, a joyous trans-global
celebration of mindless riffing and instantly forgettable pap.
But where does that leave the armies of baby-boomers for whom it all meant
something more? Faced with the choice of Rolling Stones decrepitude and the
infantile whingeing of freshly-forged heart throbs, where does one turn? Do
all roads have to lead to Phil Collins?
Roedy is sympathetic, and has an eye for a gap in the market. Next month,
MTV Europe is launching VH-1 in Britain, a new channel designed to cater for
the 25-49 year-olds who form the bulk of today's rock audience. Its slogan -
'Music That Means Something'  - plays unashamedly on the nostalgia felt by
the generation who once thought that Country Joe and the Fish were
responsible for the US defeat in Vietnam, although at least 50 per cent of
the channel's output will be new music.
VH-1's director of programmes, Brent Hansen, promises there will be no room
for rap, hip-hop, techno or heavy metal. 'We are aiming for people who may
occasionally watch MTV, but almost feel like visitors. They need their own
heartland, their own emotional base. They don't want to be patronised, and
they want to keep in touch with what is happening. We are also talking about
the generation which grew up with punk - they have owned the music world.'
The success of oldie music magazines such as 'Q' and, more recently, 'Mojo',
as well as 18 fruitful months of market research have been encouraging signs
for the new channel. Hansen says the research identified a musically
literate audience anxious for hard information and pointers to new trends.
'They have gone into all the megastores, they have finished buying their
greatest hits compilations and now want to find out more.'
Programming will be much less frenetic than that of MTV, with experienced
presenters (which include Nicky Horne, Paul King, David Hepworth and Tony
Vance) providing background and context to the records they will be playing.
'If we feature a country-rock band, we might look at The Byrds and Gram
Parsons, without being too train-spotterish about it,' says Hansen. The
channel is currently negotiating to acquire rights to the 'Old Grey Whistle
Test' archive, and live footage from the pre-video era will also be used.
One unwanted side-effect of the new channel may be to pull young viewers
away from MTV. 'That is not our intention, although we are aware that, with
young males, there is a heritage angle to this,' says Hansen.
Paul Du Noyer, editor of 'Mojo' (slogan: 'The Magazine for People who know
Rock'n'Roll') says his readership includes many in the 18-25 age group who
are keen to discover for themselves some of the less familiar names of the
past, such as Nick Drake or Tim Buckley. 'They believe that the great music
of the past has an enduring validity. Consequently, the audience for rock
music is ever-broadening.'
A happy meeting-point, then, for advertisers, record companies, disposable
income and consumers seeking to spice up their entry into middle age. Rock
music has achieved the extraordinary and enviable position of constantly
re-defining its own standards and borders. On an early pilot of VH-1 shown
to groups of potential viewers, a presenter refers to a 'classic' Rolling
Stones track from 1981. The truth is that, by 1981, most of the group's fans
considered them already to be about 10 years past their 'classic' years. So
what does that make them in 1994? Old, old, old.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Arts: Roots of Cunningham and Morris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mark Morris, whose L'Allegro, Penseroso, Moderato has been the glory of this
year's Edinburgh Festival, has been known to say that the living
choreographer he admires the most is Merce Cunningham 'whom I love more than
I love God'. Could two choreographers be less alike? And yet I am more sure
that these two are great artists than I am about any other artists alive.
Now, only six days after the last performance here of L'Allegro, the
Edinburgh Festival (after 15 years) has brought back the Cunningham company.
The two works they are dancing are by no means Cunningham's finest - whereas
Morris has never surpassed L'Allegro  - and yet they plunge us deep into the
extraordinary experience that Cunningham alone affords.
But let me first proceed a little further with the Morris-Cunningham
compare-and-contrast exercise. Morris's works take their roots from music,
and they keep drawing from music, whereas Cunningham's exist independently
from the scores that accompany them. In the Morris world, people belong
first and foremost to a large community; though they have some existence as
soloists and in small ensemble groups, they seldom develop any sustained
one-to-one relationships in duets. In Cunningham's world, by contrast,
people are seen as private soloists above all, each dwelling in his or her
private space; solos are frequent and powerfully individual, and duets more
remarkable yet in the many ways they show interaction between two utterly
distinct lives.
Morris's dancers are vividly human, and he often excels in showing a large
ensemble of people all sharing the same vital human impulse. People,
however, are only one part of Cunningham's vision, and his stage seems often
to be a view of flora and fauna - now as seen by some travelling safari
camera, now through the window of an aquarium. Morris's rhythms are lyrical,
full of cantilena fluency, and often marked by a thrillingly regular pulse;
Cunningham's rhythms are irregular, staccato, unpredictable, sustained by
the coolest but most powerful current of phrasing. Morris's works have
beginnings, middles, and ends; whereas Cunningham's usually give us the
illusion that the curtain and the wings are preventing us from seeing a
longer and larger moving canvas.
Perhaps, however, the differences between Cunningham and Morris only reveal
a more profound similarity. In both, we are seeing broad and probing views
of the world. We see human energies refined to exceptional levels of
mastery. We are, in fact, watching classical art, which almost nobody else
in the world makes any more. Cargo X, the first and shorter of the two works
shown here this year by Cunningham, is one of his more daffy constructions,
with a certain silly use of flowers and a stepladder. (Those who look for
symbolism everywhere can waste a lot of time on this kind of nonsense.) And
yet hardly has the curtain risen than we are off into an enthralling solo,
in which (at the performance I watched) the great Frederic Gafner swings in
the air between huge, hanging jumps of alternating convex and concave
shapes. At once rhythm and space and human energy are made vital in the ways
only Cunningham knows.
Cargo X and Enter are accompanied by two of the most stupidly cacophonous
scores I have ever heard. Usually I can take the Cunningham sound-world in
contentment, but David Tudor - an abstract expressionist of music whose
works I have sometimes admired - has made music for Enter in which whole
gaggles of geese protest at the passing of whistling V2 rockets, computors
breed with one another and then get divorced, and so on  .. This is not
merely silly but actually so intrusive as to be, in spirit, anti-Cunningham.
Even so, anyone can see that about 40 per cent of Enter ( a long 90- minute
composition) is on Cunningham's highest level, notably in its solos and
duets.
In ensembles it is always interesting when Cunningham has more than one
activity, and more than one speed, going on at the same time; but when he
has everybody doing more or less the same thing the interest drops.
Elsewhere, however, it is still true, as when I reviewed the premiere of
this work at the Paris Opera in 1992, that this dance makes one wonderfully
conscious of vertical space; each dancer seems to be merely the base of some
mighty and moving cylinder.
The work contains both extremes of slow-motion and speed, both beautifully
achieved; and sculptural stillness is often contrasted with either staccato
brilliance or unbroken slow phrases. When Cuuningham is great - which is
often enough here - nothing in the world is more peculiar or more marvelous.

<TEXT>
Political correctness can have the oddest effects. Today BBC2 champions
apartheid and screens a programme singing the praises of prostitution. If
the network presented a series promoting new comedians provided they were
white and excluded blacks there would be hell to pay. But The Real McCoy is
okay because it promotes black comedians and excludes whites. Why this South
African style 'separate development' for different races, so vehemently
opposed by BBC2 types for decades, is now acceptable on BBC2 itself is
anybody's guess (10.00).
BBC2 would not, of course, allow a woman to make a programme arguing that
prostitution can be fun because, as we know from the commissars of political
correctness, prostitution exploits women. But it seems that male
prostitution is altogether different. Just as BBC2 has, for some years,
found space for the homosexually erotic while toeing the suppression line on
the heterosexually erotic, so Open Space is readily given over to an
explanation of how 'prostitution can be a positive and enjoyable choice'
provided you are homosexual (11.15).

FT  30 AUG 94 / Arts: An Indian dream from Australia - Edinburgh Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Somebody must have told the Australian Opera about Edinburgh's new Festival
Theatre. Originally called the Empire, it was re-built after a fire in 1928
and its handsome art deco interior survived decades of use as a bingo-hall
to be lovingly restored and re-opened this year.
How kind of the Australian visitors to bring a show that was in period. A
portrait of George V smiled down from above the proscenium arch. Vignettes
of the King and Queen Mary adorned the boxes. The stage picture was of the
British Empire in its heyday - a military bandstand in the India of the Raj
with stiff-upper-lip officers and elegant ladies taking the air in the dusty
heat of the late evening.
No - it is not surprising if the opera is hard to guess. Neither Britten nor
Shakespeare had imperial India in mind when writing A Midsummer Night's
Dream. The Australian Opera production is by Baz Luhrmann, the director of
the film Strictly Ballroom, now signed up to 20th Century Fox. He is hot
property and this production has predictably proved to be a hot ticket
down-under - a vibrant and colourful crowd-puller.
The choice of India for the setting was a moment of inspiration. I used to
think of A Midsummer Night's Dream as the innocent among Britten's operas,
whereas these days it seems as much about sexual repression as any. To see
it as a clash of cultures is an interesting gloss on the story: instead of
Athenians lost in an enchanted wood, we have the starched and inhibited
English having their passions liberated in sensuous, headily-perfumed India.
Putting this exotic world of enchantment on stage must have been a
designer's dream. Catherine Martin and Bill Marron have come up with a riot
of ruby reds and midnight sapphire blues, luxuriantly bejewelled costumes
and shafts of moonlight (lit by Nigel Levings). Never mind that it looked
more like the India of the Maharishi's psychedelic sixties. This was a
welcome change from the current fashion for opera productions in
all-pervading grey.
Having set the scene so skilfully, Luhrmann was ready to probe the emotional
issues at the heart of the opera, but did he do so? In the tender scene
where Tytania and Bottom the ass settle down on the bower for a mutual
scratching session (to music from Britten of surprisingly sensual
lassitude), no suggestive glint of hidden desire broke the surface. Luhrmann
just played the scene for laughs.
And that - unfortunately  - is what happened through most of the opera.
Elisa Wilson's Helena was a nymphomaniac in jodhpurs, mercilessly pursuing
an army officer Demetrius, who was strongly sung by Paul Whelan. Ian
Bostridge played Lysander as a chinless civil servant in love with the
limpid upper-class Hermia of Kirsti Harms - caricatures all. When Puck says,
'What fools these mortals be]', one had no option but to agree.
The rustics formed the amateur dramatics group from the local army base, a
sit-com assortment of marching men in khaki shorts, with Michael Martin's
gormless Flute as camp goof. Every old knockabout pantomime routine was in
their army rule-book, but at least they had brought a good band along to
play. The Scottish Chamber Orchestra, in red army uniforms on the bandstand,
was expertly conducted by its moustachioed sergeant major, Roderick Brydon.
Subtle this show was not, except perhaps for the fairies. I could have
strangled Tyler Coppin's camp-is-not-the-word Puck long before the end, but
Kathryn McCusker looked beautiful in Tytania's sari and Michael Chance's
Oberon, with waist-length hair and pointed fingernails, was the epitome of
Indian culture as hippie heaven. As his haunting counter-tenor led the final
ensemble, Britten's music worked its magic afresh.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Technology: Building a new home for scientists - Glaxo's
Pounds 700m drug research centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's biggest building project after the Channel Tunnel, Glaxo's Pounds
700m drugs research centre (pictured right), is approaching completion in
Stevenage, 30 miles north of London. Unlike the Chunnel, it is on schedule,
below budget and there have been no fatalities nor serious injuries.
Glaxo is creating the spacious 73-acre research campus on one of the last
big greenfield sites left in south-east England. It will house 1,500
scientists and support staff who now work in overcrowded and out-dated
laboratories in Ware, a few miles from Stevenage, and Greenford, west
London.
The success of Glaxo and its contractors in controlling the project's costs
and timing, while maintaining an outstanding safety record, is an object
lesson for the construction industry.
The Stevenage project exemplifies many of the recommendations for improved
working relationships, made last month by Sir Michael Latham in his
government-sponsored report on the building industry. In particular, the
integrated management structure provides a high level of control over the
design and construction process.
The design phase involved 350 engineers, architects and cost estimators,
based in the London offices of consulting engineers Ove Arup.
Sub-contractors used the project team's computer-aided design models to
develop their own drawings. The London base is linked electronically to the
Stevenage site, so that any last-minute design changes are immediately
notified to everyone concerned.
'The project is managed like a company's board,' says Richard Haryott,
senior Arup director for the Stevenage project. 'Glaxo acts as chairman,
with the the other professionals playing a full role in decision making.'
The overall architectural planner is the Kling Lindquist Partnership of
Philadelphia, chosen because Glaxo liked the way it designed the company's
US research headquarters in North Carolina. The Stevenage campus is emerging
with the wide-open feel of an American science park, sandwiched between two
of Britain's principal transport links, the east coast main line railway and
the A1 trunk road. The landscape features a serpentine lake, as well as
28,000 trees.
The main building contractor is Laing Morris-Knudsen, a UK-US joint venture
between Laing of London and Morris-Knudsen of Cleveland, Ohio. During the
peak construction activity in 1992-93 LMK had 3,000 workers on site.
Glaxo is particularly proud of the safety record which Malcolm Carne, one of
the engineers supervising the project, says is five to 10 times better than
the UK construction industry average. Glaxo executives were warned, when
they decided in 1987 to build the research centre, that they would kill
three people in the process if the safety performance was just average.
So Glaxo, aided by Arup and Laing, implemented rigorous safety procedures.
The workforce was given generous incentives to work safely. For every
million man-hours without a serious accident, Glaxo held a draw for a new
Volvo car. 'So far we've given away 10 Volvos,' says Sir Mark Richmond,
research director.
Completing the project under budget - with a likely final cost of Pounds
670m compared with the budgeted Pounds 710m - owes a lot to lucky timing,
Richmond concedes. Cost estimates were made when the construction industry
was working at full capacity, but many of the contracts were placed two or
three years later when companies were cutting prices to win business.
Glaxo executives may worry that shareholders see the Stevenage campus as
extravagant, even with its total costs slightly reduced, now that the
company's great expansion of the 1980s is over and the pharmaceutical
industry is entering a period of relative austerity.
However Roger Newton, head of chemistry, points out that Glaxo's Greenford
labs - many dating from the 1950s  - 'were at the end of their useful life
and would have had to be replaced anyway. We also needed to build a new
microbiology pilot plant'. By putting everything on one site, Glaxo avoids
duplication of equipment and saves many tedious road journeys between Ware
and Greenford.
Sir Richard Sykes, chief executive, is unapologetic about 'the benefits of
bringing together all our research in the UK - chemistry and biology - on
one imposing site with first-class facilities. These people are going to be
more productive when they are working together in an integrated way'.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Technology: What's the object? - The answer to making
tailored software in record time is close at hand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FOREMSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Technology that could solve one of the biggest problems facing computer
users - the length of time that it takes to develop application programs
tailored to the specific requirements of a business - is on the horizon.
Recently, Taligent, a joint venture between IBM, Apple Computer and
Hewlett-Packard, unveiled the results of a six-year effort to develop
'object technology' that could revolutionise the way software programs are
created.
Taligent is one of a handful of companies pursuing the goal of creating a
set of rules that will enable software developers to create unique programs
through the use of software components known as objects. Software objects
will work together in much the same way that off-the-shelf semiconductor
chips can be used to build a desktop personal computer or a multi-billion
dollar supercomputer.
Object technology could have an enormous impact if it fulfils its promise of
faster applications development. A survey of Fortune 1,000 companies by
Taligent in 1993 found that, in many cases, the time taken to develop a
custom application can eclipse the business opportunity it is designed to
support.
'One large company told me that during the 12 months it would take to
rewrite the software for their billing systems, they would lose more than
Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) in revenues,' says Bud Tribble, vice-president of
SunSoft, Sun Microsystems' software subsidiary. The contribution of object
technology would be seen as having made a 'profound change in our industry'.
However, the development of object technology - in which software code is
reused as much as possible by creating self-contained programs (objects) for
specific tasks - has not been easy. The concepts were pioneered at Xerox's
Palo Alto Research Centre. Xerox researchers developed SmallTalk, the first
object-based software language, in the 1970s.
The first company to offer a commercial object operating system was Next
Computer, founded in 1985 by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. Next is currently
the market leader with its NextStep software used by customers in financial
markets such as Chrysler Financial, the credit arm of US car manufacturer
Chrysler, and in healthcare markets by companies such as Abbott Labs.
Apple began work on its object software system, code-named Pink, in the late
1980s. It then formed Taligent with IBM in March 1992 to finish the project.
Hewlett-Packard joined Taligent in early 1994 with the purchase of a 15 per
cent stake.
Microsoft, the world's biggest software company, has also been working on
developing object-based software for the past three years with its object
linking and embedding technology. It plans to introduce an object-based
operating system (code-named Cairo) in 1996, giving its popular Windows
system software the ability to support object software applications.
'We believe that object technology represents the industrial revolution of
software development and that it will be essential for business application
development,' says Paul Flessner, senior product manager for enterprise
computing at Microsoft. Many US computer companies plan to offer
object-based software development systems believing that it will help sell
hardware.
Tim Bailey, strategic program manager for objects at Hewlett-Packard, says:
'There is a tremendous demand for objects among our customers. The potential
benefits to organisations from object technology are impressive.' Jobs, for
example, claims that an 18-month software development project could be cut
down to two months or less with NextStep.
While there are many supporters of object-based software development, not
everyone is convinced about the dramatically faster application development
claims. 'It's a standard salesman's pitch,' says William Zachmann, president
of Canopus Research. 'Companies have been making such claims since the 1960s
and 1970s. The fact is that developing these custom applications is very
difficult. There are numerous layers of complexity that have to be dealt
with. There is no guarantee that object technology will make this job
easier.'
In order for object-based software to become more widely used, several
issues have to be settled. These include the definition of industry
standards. The main standards effort is being led by the Object Management
Group (OMG), an organisation with more than 420 member companies, and its
Common Object Request Broker Architecture (Corba) standard. But there is no
guarantee that the Corba standard will be followed by everyone.
Microsoft, for example, is a member of the OMG and says it will support
industry standards, but it is nevertheless developing its own specifications
which are different from Corba. Next is also hoping that its NextStep
software will become an industry standard.
Uncertainty over which object technologies will succeed has led some
companies to back several at once. Hewlett-Packard intends to offer
object-based systems from Taligent, Microsoft and Next.
'We have an open object strategy,' explains Bailey. 'Different markets are
using different tools. Finance companies, for example, are using NextStep
while communications companies are using C++ (an object computer language).
We are following our customers.'
Digital Equipment Corporation, the US computer maker, is pursuing a similar
strategy. It has agreed to offer NextStep on its computers but it also plans
to support Microsoft's object-based software.
Sun Microsystems has chosen to stick with one company and has made a Dollars
10m investment in Next. It will combine NextStep with its own object
technology called Distributed Objects Environment.
Education is another issue that must be considered. 'Training and mentoring
services are very important to ensure that customers succeed with object
technology,' says Richard Dym, vice president of marketing at ParcPlace
Systems, the developer of SmallTalk-based application development tools.
Training is important because object-based software development represents a
radical departure from the way most programmers have been taught to write
applications. 'Some programmers just aren't open to change and they don't
want to be retrained,' says Flessner.
To undertake a serious object-based software development effort, companies
would need to retrain some of their programmers and then spend a year or
more planning and developing the first object applications. Even then, the
cost/benefits of using object technology might not be seen until well into
the second or third year.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Business and the Law: Bit of a mess over waste -
Disappointment for the EU packaging industry and environmentalists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANA BENTLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The failure of the European Environment Council to approve the proposed
Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive this June was a disappointment for
environmentalists and the packaging industry alike. With the directive now
consigned to the unfamiliar conciliation procedure established under the
Maastricht treaty, its future seems in doubt, leaving member states free to
pursue their own, disparate management systems.
The directive, adopted by the European Commission in July 1992 and amended
in September 1993, was intended to control the hazard presented by packaging
waste, and to overcome the threat posed by individual national schemes to
the single market. But, although a harmonised approach to packaging control
is generally welcomed by member states, it was blocked in the council in
March by Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands, which believed the target
waste-recovery and recycling rates were not sufficiently stringent.
Targets outlined in the directive are much lower than those originally
proposed and have some flexibility. For the first five years after the
implementation of the directive, targets would be 50-65 per cent for
packaging waste recovery and 25-45 per cent for recycling, averaged across
all packaging materials, with a minimum of 15 per cent for each kind of
waste material. Targets for the ensuing 10-year period, intended to be
higher, would be established under a review procedure.
Some friction over the issue was avoided through provisions that would allow
upward derogation from targets for member states wishing to exceed them -
provided their measures did not distort the single market, damage the
environment or hinder other member states' compliance with the directive.
Downward derogation would also be permitted for Greece, Ireland and
Portugal, prompting criticism that the directive falls some way short of
harmonisation.
So why did the directive fail?
Several issues led to the impasse. Some member states opposed not only
flexibility of targets, but also the management hierarchy of waste control.
Under the directive, methods such as recycling, re-use and recovery,
including incineration with energy recovery, are considered equally
acceptable until environmental impact studies prove otherwise. While the
European Parliament's proposal that an article specifically calling for
prevention of waste was accepted, its suggestion that methods be listed in
order of preference was not.
Economic instruments such as a tax on waste or landfill levies also proved
controversial. 'Some countries were loath to hand over tax-making power to
the Council,' explains Ms Suzanne Clabon, of UK law firm Clifford Chance.
But it was Belgium, fearing the provision could threaten the future of its
planned eco taxes, that dealt a death blow to the directive in June by
forming a blocking majority.
Ironically, while the EU prevaricates on the directive, various member
states have addressed the subject, and diverse national measures have now
intensified the need for harmonisation. The treaty base of the directive
remains Article 100a, with its objective of protecting the single market,
but currently, says Ms Clabon, 'the number and nature of national management
systems could well be a threat to the single market'.
Mr James Devereux of Incpen, an independent UK industry body, agrees. 'They
certainly don't help create a level playing field and some are viewed as
thinly disguised trade barriers.'
National regimes vary considerably. France's legislation introduced in 1992
addresses household packaging waste, which producers must take back or pass
on to a state-approved organisation under a scheme administered by local
authorities. Incineration and recycling are permitted. Currently, rules are
being developed for commercial waste.
So far the UK has avoided legislation and opted for a system of
self-regulation. Plans of the Producer Responsibility Industry Group, an
independent body formed by private industry on government prompting, propose
a scheme to achieve a recovery level of 58 per cent of packaging waste by
2000 and the establishment of an organisation to raise necessary revenues.
But the group and many in the industry still support the idea of legislation
to enforce compliance with the system.
The most controversial regulation is the German Packaging Ordinance of 1991,
the most ambitious of the national schemes. To comply with the ordinance,
many in German industry now subscribe to the Duales System Deutschland
(DSD), which operates a collection and reprocessing system. Subscribers pay
a levy to belong to the system under which their products are marked with an
identifying symbol. Exporters of goods to Germany have little choice but to
join the system.
Such is the success of the ordinance, which prevents incineration and
landfills, that Germany is unable to recycle all the waste collected and has
been forced to export some - particularly plastics that are difficult to
recycle. Problems have resulted for environmental controllers in recipient
countries, and the difficulties may intensify when the targets for recovery
increase to 80 per cent across the board in 1995.
'The German system is the most comprehensive, but also has problems,'
confirms Mr Bernd Meyer-Witting of Clifford Chance's Frankfurt office. 'As
well as the problems with plastics, there is some confusion generated among
consumers as to segregation of waste. But there are also cartel issues -
with organisations such as the DSD, are you setting up a national monopoly
which can set prices?'
Even if the directive proceeds, problems with national schemes may persist.
Provisions regarding methods of achieving targets are general, leaving
member states free to develop their own management schemes, although
proposals for national schemes must be submitted to the Council before
adoption.
The directive now lies in limbo, with talks on its future due to start in
September. 'The matter will be procedurally complicated,' says Ms Clabon.
Post-Maastricht, some directives failing to gain Council approval at this
stage are subject to the 'co-decision' procedure, under Article 189B of the
treaty, between the Council and the European Parliament. 'The concern is
that the Council and Parliamentary representatives may not just consider the
contentious issues but may reopen debate on the entire directive,' she says.
Parliament in this procedure ultimately has a power of veto over the
directive. 'Parliament is traditionally stronger on environmental issues and
the newly elected Parliament may want to flex its muscles,' says Ms Clabon.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Government as venture
capitalist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What do Intel, Apple Computer, Cray Research and Federal Express have in
common? All are now Fortune 500 companies. But in their youth they also all
received financial help from a hybrid venture capital programme that brings
the private sector together with the US government.
Despite recent problems, the Small Business Investment Company programme has
proved a valuable way to get development capital to early-stage companies in
the US but is a model that most governments elsewhere have chosen not to
imitate.
The programme was set up in 1958 after a Federal Reserve Board study found
that long-term loan and equity finance was not generally available to
growing companies. Led by the Small Business Administration, the SBICs have
invested more than Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.4bn) of private and public funds
in 73,000 small businesses.
But despite the list of illustrious names with which SBICs are associated,
the programme has not had a happy recent history. The recession prevented
many companies backed by SBICs from maturing and distributing profits. At
the same time the SBICs still had to pay interest on the
government-guaranteed debentures they had issued. Caught in a cash squeeze
and dogged by poor management, many of the SBICs failed, leaving the
taxpayer to pick up the losses.
The Clinton Administration is now trying to revitalise the programme. Early
this year it announced a new funding mechanism that should eliminate the
SBICs' cashflow squeeze. The new government-backed security will be in the
form of a redeemable preferred stock, or participating security, on which
payment will only be made when the SBICs have retained earnings from their
investments.
According to Robert Stillman, the SBA's associate administrator for
investment, the 56 venture capitalists wanting SBA licences for new SBICs
want to invest Dollars 1bn of equity in the new companies.
The SBICs are privately owned and run. But for every dollar the private
sector commits to them the government provides up to three.
And because the government only looks for an all-in return of about 11 per
cent on its investment, compared with one well above 20 per cent sought by
private-sector venture capitalists, the overall cost of capital to the early
stage company is reduced.
The scheme has congressional approval for Dollars 550m until the end of
1995. But it may need an appropriation of more than Dollars 3bn over five
years to match the private sector's apparent enthusiasm, a commitment
Congress may not have fully taken on board.
Supporting its pitch to Congress, the SBA says SBICs have been a cheap way
of creating jobs. Policy makers outside the US, who are pondering whether an
equity gap exists in their countries, will be interested in the Small
Business Administration's definition of a small business. The SBICs are
allowed to invest in businesses that are relatively well-established but the
SBA believes they still lack access to capital. Investments can be made in
companies with a net worth of up to Dollars 18m or Dollars 6m of post-tax
profits, although 20 per cent of funds are allocated to companies making up
to Dollars 2m.
With investment limits set at this level, some observers say the SBICs are
doing little more than provide government-subsidised capital to ventures
that would have raised the finance anyway. Would Federal Express, for
example, which raised about Dollars 50m in venture capital in a first
tranche, really not have taken off without an SBIC investment?
Erskine Bowles, the SBA administrator, says there is no way of proving that
the SBIC programme is not replicating what the market is already offering.
But he insists it will introduce equity into companies that would not
otherwise have raised capital.
The SBA is also trying to strengthen the SBIC programme by requiring
private-sector partners to put up more capital and by applying a more
rigorous quality test to the venture capitalists applying for licences.
But in the most novel development, the new mechanism will give the
government a share of profits in successful investments. One can only
speculate how much higher the SBA's stock would have risen had this equity
kicker been in place when the SBICs backed Intel, Apple and Federal Express.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Change of style and
substance - Erskine Bowles, the top US small business policy maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Erskine Bowles, administrator of the US Small Business Administration, is
having a rough ride in Washington.
Bowles has been besieged by critics of President Clinton's healthcare
programme. In particular, he is feeling the heat from small business
lobbyists upset that he is supporting the president's call for the so-called
'employer mandate', which would force employers to pay some of their
employees' healthcare insurance premiums.
'We have had a big bump in the road called healthcare which has hurt the
credibility of Erskine Bowles and the SBA,' says Jack Faris, president of
the National Federation of Independent Businesses.
But the flak directed at the Bowles healthcare stance has obscured the fact
that big changes both in style and substance are taking place at the SBA.
There is little doubt that an agency, that was for years a backwater led by
a string of failed senatorial candidates, has been enjoying something of a
renaissance.
Bowles arrived in Washington as a political outsider. Armed with real
business experience first at Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, and then
at the North Carolina bank he set up to serve small and medium-sized
enterprises, he caught the president's eye during the election campaign.
Bowles was appointed to the White House's influential National Economic
Council, the first time an SBA administrator had been included at that level
of policy making. 'The SBA has historically been moribund,' says Bowles.
'For eight years Reagan tried to get rid of it and for four years Bush
ignored it.' Now, Bowles says, the SBA has direct access to the president
and can act as his eyes and ears in the small business community. And the
seat on the National Economic Council means the SBA can provide an input
before policy is made.
The SBA's starting point is that smaller businesses are creating more jobs
than big business in the US, a view that has altered little in the wake of
recent studies which suggest this case is over-stated. The latest assault on
this conventional wisdom came in March from economists working under the
auspices of the Commerce Department who questioned if there was any
relationship between the size of manufacturing companies and their ability
to create jobs.
But the administration remains convinced that smaller companies are the
engine of the economy. 'My bottom line is jobs - and not just any jobs, good
jobs,' Bowles says. 'The jobs are created by the private sector, by smaller
businesses.' But the SBA is trying to focus its scarce resources more on
those companies most likely to create jobs.
Bowles's most immediate impact has been to reduce the bureaucracy
surrounding the agency's largest offering, the Loan Guarantee Programme,
which is available to businesses refused credit by banks. 'I have heard
people say: 'I would rather throw up than borrow from the SBA',' Bowles
says. A new programme, called Lowdoc, has dramatically reduced the time
businesses need to prepare applications for smaller loans. With a simple
one-page application for loans under Dollars 100,000 (Pounds 67,000), rather
than one that required the help of a consultant to complete, businesses are
returning to the programme, Bowles says, a view supported by the small
business lobby. The programme is now expected to guarantee more than Dollars
8bn in 1996, against Dollars 6.5bn this year.
Responding to a growing lament that small businesses are 'most starved for
working capital', Bowles is also making the SBA's working capital guarantee
more flexible and more like a private-sector revolving facility.
The administration has also successfully supported the introduction of a
more user-friendly version of its Small Business Investment Company
programme, an unusual partnership between government and venture
capitalists, described in the article below.
Such enthusiastic application is something that has not been associated with
the SBA. The change has been welcomed by groups such as the National Small
Business United, a lobbying organisation which represents larger businesses
than the NFIB. John Galles, its executive vice-president, says Bowles has
'galvanised the SBA and given it a new sense of mission'.
Faris says Bowles should be applauded for speeding up the Loan Guarantee
Programme process and for moving SBA staff from Washington closer to the
customer at district level. But he says small businesses are far more
concerned by the 'alphabet soup of government agencies like the
Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration'. By comparison to the ills these agencies can visit on small
businesses, the SBA's contribution is marginal, he says.
Bowles recognises the problem and has made the attack on regulations a
priority. He has set up regular judicial reviews to look at the implications
for small businesses of new legislation.
But whether his attack on red tape will be believed is open to question. The
doubt stems, again, from his healthcare position which critics say would
heap extra costs on the shoulders of small business.
'We were impressed (by Bowles' seat on the National Economic Council) until
he started arguing on healthcare reform,' says Faris. 'We are not sure now
he is a good thing for small business.'

FT  30 AUG 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Cheque clearance system
explained - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A Barclays Bank pamphlet aims to explain the mysteries of the cheque
clearing system for business customers.
The bank says 44 per cent of small businesses do not know how long it takes
their bank to clear a cheque. The answer is five days for cheques paid in at
the account holder's Barclays branch and six for cheques paid in elsewhere.
British banks are governed by the 1882 Bills Exchange Act which means more
than 8m cheques travel British roads every day. The act calls for cheques to
be returned to the banks on which they were issued. Bankers are hoping a
move to truncate this antiquated process will be included in the Queen's
Speech in November.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Management (The Growing Business): High-tech conferences -
In a nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fans of high-technology companies, their problems and what they can bring to
the world, have an embarrassment of riches this autumn.
A high-technology, small-firms conference on September 19-20 hosted by
Manchester Business School* aims to promote contacts between policy makers,
industrialists and academics.
The conference includes a French contribution underlining the lack of
advantages small companies enjoy as technology grows more complex, a US look
at the role of Federal laboratories as industrial partners, and a 'lesson'
in high-technology new-product development from International Business
Machines.
On October 11, Warwick Business School** is holding a one-day seminar
comparing the performance of high-technology companies on and off UK science
parks. An HMSO publication on the issue will be published the same day.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Dispute costs IoD members Pounds 180m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 11-week rail strike has cost members of the Institute of Directors more
than Pounds 180m according to the institute, which today renews its call for
industrial disputes in essential services to be settled by binding
arbitration.
The IoD said a survey of its 33,000 members showed that three out of 10
directors said their businesses had suffered financially because of the
strikes. In the south nearly a third of directors said the impact on
business had been serious.
Companies across the country estimate that they have lost between Pounds
1,000 and Pounds 10,000 a week because of the disruption to rail services.
The survey shows that a fifth of businesses which normally distribute by
rail have decided that they will switch permanently to road transport.
The IoD, which in the past has called for the banning of all public-sector
strikes that breach procedure agreements, said disputes should be eliminated
with the introduction of legally binding arbitration.
Mrs Ann Robinson, head of the IoD policy unit, said the government should
ensure that 'suppliers of essential services maintain those services at all
times'.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Levers hold up Railtrack's ambitions: The company can only
go so far in opening lines during the strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Railtrack's efforts to open longer sections of the British railway network
on strike days seem set to slow down as the company reaches the limits of
signalling technology.
By concentrating staff at the most modern computer-controlled signalboxes
Railtrack has in recent weeks managed to open up sections of track way out
of proportion to the number of signalworkers employed.
At first sight the numbers are hard to credit. Just 600 signalling staff -
13 per cent of the normal workforce of 4,600 - allowed Railtrack to open up
40 per cent of its network in last week's 24-hour strike.
But unless striking members of the RMT transport union return to work in
large numbers Railtrack will face serious problems in opening up its more
labour-intensive lever-operated signal boxes.
Railtrack has inherited three generations of railway signalling technology
from British Rail.
No fewer than 951 of the 1,125 signalboxes on the railway's 10,000-mile
network date from the steam age. They need a signalman to pull a lever to
change the signal.
A further 165 are panel boxes introduced in the 1960s. These consist of
large display panels where a red light records the passage of a train along
the track and where the signalling staff push buttons to operate the
signals.
The latest signalling boxes are known as integrated electronic control
centres. Signals are controlled by computer, although the signal worker can
override the computer if a train breaks down or if there is any other
disruption to the normal schedule.
Railtrack has only nine of these control centres but they control extensive
lengths of track.
Railtrack has managed to open a disproportionately large part of its network
by three main methods.
It has allocated its signalling staff to the more modern electronic and
panel boxes where they control greater lengths of track.
Railtrack's Great Western zone, which operates 1,370 miles of track from
London Paddington to the West Country and south Wales, has only eight panel
boxes on the 225 miles from London to Plymouth but 11 manual boxes on the 80
miles from Plymouth to Penzance.
It has concentrated its efforts on the panel boxes and maintained a 'near
normal' mainline service down to Plymouth but no trains onwards to Penzance
on strike days.
This approach is typical of Railtrack zones around the country. They have
shut down branch lines which depend on the manual boxes and kept open the
main routes. Cutting out the branch line services simplifies the railway
timetable and means fewer trains crossing over the main lines.
Secondly, by reducing the frequency of many of its services there are
greater intervals between trains so a smaller number of signalling staff can
run the railway safely.
Finally, although Railtrack says it has been running 40 per cent of its
network, this claim is only true if it is applied to peak and daytime
operations. Services are generally starting later than normal and closing
earlier in the evening, so fewer signalworkers are needed on shift duty.
The uneven distribution of the new and old technology boxes around the
country has sometimes prevented Railtrack from opening up through routes.
The east coast main line linking London King's Cross with Edinburgh has
electronic control centres at Newcastle upon Tyne and York and panel boxes
at King's Cross, Peterborough and Doncaster.
But the middle stretch of line between Peterborough and Doncaster has a
number of level crossings controlled by manual boxes. For the first 10 weeks
of the strike Railtrack could open the northern and southern sections of the
line but was unable to provide a through service.
As BR has modernised its network it has brought in more electronic control
centres. The Chiltern line is controlled from one box at London Marylebone
and has maintained a near normal service.
In the longer term, Railtrack is looking to bring in even more advanced
technology which will do away with trackside signals and the wires which
link them. Drivers will have in-cab display panels linked by radio to
control centres telling them the state of the track ahead.
The 550-mile west coast main line, to be modernised over the next few years,
could be controlled by one signal box.
The traditional signal worker seems set to go the same way as the fireman
who stoked the steam engine.

FT  30 AUG 94 / PIA has applications of 4,000 financial advisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Personal Investment Authority, the watchdog to protect the private
investor, will today publish figures likely to show that applications from
companies and individuals regulated by Lautro and Fimbra have reached 4,000
out of a potential membership of about 5,500, Alison Smith writes.
There is less than five weeks to the deadline by which any financial adviser
must apply to the PIA for authorisation to remain in retail financial
services. The regulator became operational last month.
The gap between the actual and potential numbers of applicants has sparked
suggestions that there could be a significant fall in the independent
financial advice sector, as many now authorised decide not to continue under
the PIA.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Fifth of companies 'expect to relocate': Survey shows
Bristol, Edinburgh and Nottingham are favourites while London is placed 18th
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than a fifth of UK companies expect to relocate in the next five years,
with Bristol, Edinburgh and Nottingham the top three choices for businesses
planning a move, says a survey published today.
Wigan, Sunderland, Bradford, Liverpool and Belfast were the least popular of
the 40 cities considered. London ranked 18th behind Manchester, Birmingham,
Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
The survey, by Black Horse Relocation, part of Lloyds Bank, and Management
Today magazine, received responses from chairmen, chief executives and other
senior directors of 536 companies. Ten companies had turnovers of more than
Pounds 100m and four employed more than 5,000 staff.
About 22 per cent said they were very likely or quite likely to relocate in
the next five years. More than a third cited business expansion as the main
reason for moving.
The survey says: 'This was nearly twice as important as restructuring or
reorganising businesses which was the next most popular reason, chosen by 16
per cent.'
Mr John Carolan, managing director of Black Horse Relocation, said: 'This is
a clear sign that the economy is recovering and is very encouraging for the
future. Previously most companies have been moving because they have been
cutting back or closing works.'
Black Horse expects to move about 4,500 families this year on behalf of
companies and public-sector organisations.
The most important factors in choosing a business location, according to the
survey, were:
Quality of the local workforce (identified by 57 per cent of executives who
responded in the survey).
Quality of road communications (44 per cent).
Cost of overheads, such as local authority rates (36 per cent).
Also important were availability of local customers (23 per cent); property
costs (21 per cent) and competitive wage rates (20 per cent). Executives
were less concerned about access to London (6 per cent) and proximity to air
and rail networks (5 per cent).
Most important personal factors cited by executives included: overall
quality of life (57 per cent); cost of living (30 per cent); crime rate (29
per cent); access to countryside (27 per cent); and the quality of local
schools (26 per cent).
Bristol was found to be the most attractive centre for business relocation,
closely followed by Edinburgh and Nottingham. Norwich, Plymouth and Exeter
were among those in the top 10.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Little progress towards long-term job security
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The official unemployment figures may be falling, but there is little sign
that long-term job security is returning in Norwich, Southampton or
Manchester.
While the pace of job-shedding may be slowing, employers see little need to
take on additional full-time staff.
Mr Rod Sellers of British Vita in Middleton said: 'Employers will tend to
hire people on short-term contracts to cover short-term demand increases.
None of us is confident enough to take on long-term staff. We tend to bring
in part-time or temporary people instead.'
Mr Geoff Walters of Southampton city council's economic development office
said: 'Unemployment is falling but what appears to be happening is the
steady growth of part-time jobs and in some cases the substitution of
full-time by part-time jobs.'
These local trends are confirmed at national level. The spring Labour Force
Survey from the Department of Employment, which covers March to May, showed
that part-time employment rose by 86,000 between winter and spring, while
full-time employment fell by 8,000.
Mr Walters sees the growth in jobs as primarily male, particularly in
retailing and restaurants. In contrast, Ms Sandra Dineen of the enterprise
services centre at Norwich city council has seen the fastest growth in
female part-time work.
Both southern towns were affected by the nature of the early 1990s
recession, which had a much greater impact on the south of England than its
1980s predecessor. Ms Dineen said that while unemployment in Norwich as a
whole was 1 1/2 percentage points below the national average 'to the north
of the city there is a pocket where male unemployment is 22 per cent. This
is the first time in any recession that unemployment has been a real
problem'.
Big employers in all three areas are still shedding staff, as illustrated in
Manchester last week by electricity group Norweb's decision to cut 1,200
jobs in the next five years.
The old-style certainties are fast disappearing. The new flexible labour
market means employees must be prepared to change jobs, industries, working
hours and pay structures.
In such an uncertain world it is no surprise that the feel-good factor is
elusive.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Adverts promote fish consumption
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 1m television advertising campaign to promote consumption of fish
is being launched this week.
The five-week campaign is being run by the Sea Fish Industry Authority, a
promotional body funded by levies on fish landings and imports. The
authority said the campaign was the first on television since 1988 and aimed
to recoup 'two lost years' when it was unable to advertise because of a cut
in the levy.
Cod, haddock and plaice account for about half of UK fish consumption
although 60 varieties of fish and shellfish are available. The authority
said, however, that the campaign was not 'geared towards encouraging people
to experiment with fish'.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Sale of mining assets attacked
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is attempting to sell 'worthless mining assets' to
prospective buyers of British Coal, according to an industry newsletter
published today, Michael Smith writes.
Coal UK, a Financial Times publication, says the Department of Trade and
Industry has included opencast assets in the sale which were refused
planning applications and appeals some years ago.
The worst affected of the five regions being put out to tender is central
north, where 80 per cent of what the DTI has described as 'fully proven'
opencast reserves have failed to gain approval for exploitation in the past,
according to Coal UK.
The south Wales region includes Colliers' Row, which Coal UK says was
notorious as the only site to have been refused planning permission by an
energy secretary after it had gained all other necessary permissions.
