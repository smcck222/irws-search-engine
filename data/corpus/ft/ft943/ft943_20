FT  27 AUG 94 / International Company News: US investment fund may take
stake in Vox

GS Capital Partners, an investment fund run by the US securities house
Goldman Sachs, may take a a 25.2 per cent stake in Vox, the ailing German
television station which Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation recently
bought into.
GSCP would not comment on the details of the purchase yesterday, but said
negotiations were likely to be completed over the next few weeks. 'We are
interested but we have not made any decision yet,' said a spokesman for
Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt.
News Corporation last month acquired a 49 per cent stake for nothing after
negotiations with Bertelsmann, the international media group, which started
the station at the beginning of 1993 and has been struggling to keep it
alive after it went into liquidation in March this year. Bertelsmann holds a
24.9 per cent stake.
Any deal with GSCP would need the approval of the authorities for four
Lander.
GSCP, a Dollars 1bn investment fund set up in 1992, has made a series of US
media investments. Together with two US partners the fund recently entered
the UK market, paying Dollars 150m for an 80 per cent stake in
Nottingham-based Diamond Cable Communications.
Vox, which has an audience share of about 2 per cent, may be attractive
because it is one of only three channels to have access to the entire German
terrestrial and cable television network.
However, the channel is estimated to have cost its original six shareholders
about DM400 during the 15 months before it went into liquidation.
Various international media groups, including CLT, the Luxembourg-based
broadcaster, were rumoured to be considering a stake in the venture as
Bertelsmann searched for partners.
The Cologne-based station has limped along over the last five months,
operating on a skeleton staff and buying in its news programmes from Spiegel
TV, another German operator.

FT  27 AUG 94 / International Company News: Viag's 35% rise in first half
meets expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Viag, the German energy and industrial conglomerate, yesterday reported a 35
per cent rise in first-half pre-tax profits to DM411m (Dollars 266m), as
expected, and forecast that full-year results would show a similar profits
increase.
The company said the results of far-reaching restructuring in recent years
were beginning to feed through, and that the figures had also been helped by
acquisitions.
Turnover in the first six months rose to DM12.62bn, up 4 per cent on the
same period the year before, with seven of the group's eight divisions
reporting improved sales.
Only aluminium, the group's second-biggest sector, saw a fall in turnover,
down 6.7 per cent to DM2.33bn. The division has undergone extensive
restructuring and has been suffering from low aluminium prices and cheaper
imports from the former Soviet Union. However, the company said aluminium
orders were 'lively' and there were signs that the world price was
improving.
The group said it had benefited from better prospects for the German
economy, notably in the transport and trading divisions.
However, in other divisions, notably glass and metal packaging, the rise in
turnover was helped by acquisitions. Gerresheimer, the 51 per cent owned
glass-making subsidiary, lifted turnover by 12 per cent following the
purchase of a 51 per cent stake in Kimble, a leading US manufacturer.
Viag this week completed the 100 per cent takeover of Bayernwerk, Germany's
third largest utility, a purchase which is set to increase group turnover to
about DM40bn, making it one of the top 10 German companies in sales terms.
The full 1994 results will reflect the incorporation of Bayernwerk for the
last four months of the year, distorting results compared with those
reported last year, the company warned.

FT  27 AUG 94 / International Company News: Uni Storebrand tumbles to NKr36m

A sharp fall in financial income arrested the recovery of Uni Storebrand in
the first half, sending the Norwegian insurer's consolidated profits
tumbling to NKr36m (Dollars 5m) from NKr689m.
Bond market turbulence more than offset the improvement in underlying
insurance business, the company said.
Uni Storebrand almost collapsed in 1992 after a disastrous raid on Skandia,
the Swedish insurer, but has retained its position as Norway's leading
insurance group following reconstruction.
The group's life unit saw operating profit slump to NKr1.09bn from NKr1.98bn
as net financial income dropped to NKr2.43bn from NKr3.49bn. The underlying
business showed a healthy trend with premiums rising 49 per cent to
NKr3.34bn and market share climbing 2 percentage points to 30.7 per cent.
Premiums were 7 per cent higher at NKr3.3bn.

FT  27 AUG 94 / International Company News: American Barrick's golden
opportunity - Takeover of Lac Minerals would create biggest gold producer
outside South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When American Barrick's senior managers signed up for Spanish lessons two
years ago, they had no idea what would be coming their way in the summer of
1994.
The Toronto-based gold producer was planning to expand in Latin America, and
the managers used their new linguistic skills to buy advanced exploration
properties, and to tie up joint ventures with small resource companies.
Barrick has put down roots in this way in Peru, Bolivia, Argentina,
Venezuela and Chile.
These ventures are dwarfed, however, by the assets Barrick will acquire
thanks to its apparent victory in the seven-week takeover battle for Lac
Minerals, another Canadian gold producer. Lac's crown jewel is its 83 per
cent interest in the El Indio mine and adjacent deposits in northern Chile,
whose ambitious expansion plans could make it one of the world's premier
gold mining areas.
Mr Peter Munk, Barrick's chairman, claimed victory on Wednesday after Lac's
directors agreed to a sweetened offer consisting of cash and Barrick shares
worth an estimated CDollars 2.2bn (USDollars 1.6bn).
Lac isn't quite in Mr Munk's bag yet. Its shares are widely dispersed, with
many in the hands of unpredictable arbitrageurs.
A rival bid by Royal Oak Mines of Vancouver is, on paper, worth more than
the Barrick offer. Barrick's shares are widely considered, however, to be
more attractive and more liquid than those of the much smaller Royal Oak.
Rumours also persist that another contender may still emerge. Echo Bay
Mines, a gold producer based in Denver, Colorado, is most often mentioned.
Mr Jim Pitblado, Lac's chairman, acknowledges that his board will have to
withdraw its support from Barrick if a better offer materialises.
Barrick's bid could falter if only a third of the shares are withheld when
its offer expires on September 6. In that event, Barrick would probably
extend its bid in the hope that more shares would trickle in.
But Mr Munk is sufficiently confident of eventual success that he appeared
with Mr Pitblado on Wednesday to spell out his vision of the combined
company's future.
Less than a decade ago, Barrick was a struggling resources company, unable
even to retain the services of some of Canada's leading securities firms. It
has grown into one of North America's biggest and most profitable gold
producers, due mainly to its canny acquisition in 1987 of the Goldstrike
mine in Nevada, and a prescient policy of hedging its production against
falls in the bullion price.
Goldstrike's output has jumped from 40,000 ozs in 1987 to an estimated 1.7m
ozs this year, or about 90 per cent of Barrick's total production. But
development work at Goldstrike is now largely complete. That leaves a team
of skilled mining engineers looking for new challenges, and Barrick looking
for an outlet for the USDollars 1m in cash flowing in from Goldstrike each
day.
'American Barrick built its business in North America,' Mr Munk says. 'It
doesn't have a large inventory of offshore properties where it can focus on
future growth.'
In addition to its growing interest in Latin America, Barrick has expanded
its presence in east Asia. It has an exploration office in Beijing and
earlier this summer opened another in Jakarta. It has also been sniffing
around west Africa.
The addition of Lac - assuming investors tender their shares - will boost
Barrick's annual gold output from an estimated 1.9m ozs this year to about
3m ozs, making it the biggest producer outside South Africa. If Lac's
present expansion plans come to fruition, the combined total would rise to
more than 3.5m ozs by 1997.
However, Barrick has indicated that it will probably sell Lac's Canadian
mines. Although they generate sizeable cash flows, these properties have
little growth potential. These sales, as well as Royal Oak's obvious
interest in acquisitions, could substantially redraw the North American gold
mining industry in coming months.
El Indio is another story. In an effort to impress shareholders, Lac last
month raised its estimate of proven, probable and 'possible' reserves at El
Indio and the nearby Nevada property from 3.6m to 9.7m ozs. It has already
given the go-ahead for a USDollars 168m mine at Nevada. A bigger expansion
is on the cards if the new reserve figures are verified.
The rationale behind the takeover battle for Lac, which was initiated by
Royal Oak on July 7, was that the Toronto company has in the past failed to
make the best of its opportunities. While Barrick's share price has
multiplied almost seven times in the past five years, Lac's has remained
flat.
Lac responded to the criticism by dumping its chief executive, Mr Peter
Allen, and stepping up its expansion plans.
Barrick is likely to continue the house-cleaning. It noted in its offer
document that 'there will be significant opportunities for corporate and
operational synergies and economies as the two businesses are brought
together'.
One question mark is the future of Mr Peter Steen, brought in as Lac's new
chief executive less than a month ago from Homestake Mining of San
Francisco. It is difficult to visualise the no-nonsense Mr Steen working
with Mr Bob Smith, Barrick's earthy president.
One Lac insider who will be happy to see the end of the saga is Mr Pitblado.
Formerly head of RBC Dominion Securities, Canada's biggest securities firm,
Mr Pitblado was a non-executive Lac director until he was catapulted into
the chairman's seat by Mr Allen's departure. Mr Pitblado says he wants to
get back to his cottage on Stoney Lake, north-east of Toronto, to resume his
interrupted summer holiday.

FT  27 AUG 94 / International Company News: Role in KPN flotation helps lift
ABN Amro
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ABN Amro, the largest bank in the Netherlands, posted a 14.3 per cent rise
in first-half net profit, helped in part by its leading role in the June
bourse flotation of KPN, the Dutch telecommunications and postal company.
Net profit rose to Fl 1.16bn (Dollars 670m) from Fl 1.01bn, on total revenue
up 7.7 per cent at Fl 7.46bn.
Interest income grew by 9.2 per cent to Fl 4.8bn, due to volume growth in
lending but also to a slightly higher interest rate margin overseas. At
home, the interest margin was virtually unchanged.
Commission income rose by an even stronger 14.7 per cent to Fl 1.95bn. Of
this amount, securities commission - which includes fees earned as
lead-manager of the KPN issue, the largest in Dutch corporate history - was
up 32.3 per cent at Fl 942m.
The first-half figures also showed that the bank doubled its profits in
North America, enabling it to absorb lower results posted at home and in
Europe.
Earnings per share rose by 7.1 per cent to Fl 3.45, reflecting an increase
in the number of shares outstanding. ABN Amro forecast a 'sustained'
increase in earnings per share for the full year.
In the Netherlands, pre-tax profit slipped by 5.2 per cent to Fl 945m. This
was attributed mainly to a sharp fall in results from financial
transactions.

FT  27 AUG 94 / International Company News: Foreningsbanken reduces losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A near 50 per cent fall in loan losses helped Forenings-banken, the Swedish
commercial bank, cut operating losses in the first half to SKr60m (Dollars
8m) from SKr1.1bn in the same period last year.
However, the bank warned that a hoped-for return to profits in the full year
could be delayed by a slower than expected upturn in the economy caused by a
recent rise in interest rates.
The caution echoed a similar warning this week from Swedbank, another
leading Swedish bank, which downgraded its underlying profits forecast for
the full year.
Foreningsbanken, which like the rest of the country's banks has been hit by
a spate of bad loans over the past three years, said loan losses in the
first half fell 46 per cent to SKr1.19bn from SKr2.2bn last time.
Net problem loans, after provisions of SKr3.23bn, were SKr6.92bn at the end
of June, down from SKr9.38bn at the same stage a year ago. Net
non-performing loans still accounted for 7.5 per cent of the total lending
portfolio.
In common with the other banks, Foreningsbanken suffered sharp falls in
interest income and other operating income due to lower lending volumes,
shrinking interest margins and losses on bond trading.
Net interest income was down 5 per cent to SKr1.76bn from SKr1.85bn, while
other operating income was down 25 per cent to SKr338m from SKr448m. Profits
before loan losses rose to SKr1.13bn from SKr1.09bn.

FT  27 AUG 94 / UK Company News: New London reduces losses to Dollars 3.25m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
New London, the oil industry services company, reported sharply reduced
pre-tax losses of Dollars 3.25m (Pounds 2m) for the year to March 31,
against Dollars 23.7m.
The result was achieved on turnover halved at Dollars 71.9m (Dollars
135.9m), which included Dollars 46.6m from discontinued activities.
Pre-interest losses were Dollars 2.96m (Dollars 20.2m) including Dollars
1.6m from discontinued activities.
Net interest charges fell from Dollars 3.55m to Dollars 293,000. Losses per
share were 3.3 cents (23.2 cents).
Mr Paul Kesterton, chairman, said the year was affected by the disposal of
International Drilling Fluids to Schlumberger which was completed on
September 1. The result included a five months' contribution from IDF and
was struck after a loss on disposals of Dollars 12.2m offset by a prior year
provision of Dollars 12.3m.
The total consideration for IDF was Dollars 11.4m plus the acceptance of
Dollars 30m of bank debt. During the period New London also paid Dollars 10m
and 12m shares to Electra Private Equity Partners to repay debt and deferred
interest.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite 'difficult' trading conditions, Mallett, the New Bond Street art and
antique dealer, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 501,000 for the half year
to June 30, an increase of 22 per cent on the comparable Pounds 409,000.
The company attributed the upturn, achieved despite an 11 per cent
contraction in turnover to Pounds 4.56m (Pounds 5.13m), to it selling more
of its own stock.
Last time, a higher than usual proportion of sales were on a commission
basis.
The second half had started slowly but directors stressed that the main
selling thrust tended to come in the autumn months. The sales effort would
be increased, they added.
The interim dividend goes up 50 per cent to 0.75p, payable from earnings of
2.4p (2p) per share.

FT  27 AUG 94 / UK Company News: BP sells nutrition business for Dollars
425m - Largest MBO since Gardner Merchant in 1992
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Petroleum yesterday capped a two-year effort to dispose of its
nutrition business when it sold the bulk of its remaining interests for
Dollars 425m (Pounds 274m), in the largest management buy-out since 1992.
The sale means that BP has realised about Dollars 1.5bn in disposal proceeds
since it announced its withdrawal from the nutrition industry two years ago
in a move to cut debt and return to its core oil and gas business.
The buy-out, which is jointly led by CINven and Baring Capital Investors, is
the largest since the purchase of Gardner Merchant, the contract catering
company, from Forte in 1992.
Companies included in yesterday's sale are centred around the Dutch Hendrix
group, which BP bought in 1979. The new company, Nutreco, will retain the
existing management team led by Mr Richard van Wijnbergen, chief executive.
It has 20 operating companies throughout Europe and the Americas, employs
5,700 people and will have a new headquarters at Boxmeer in the Netherlands.
About two thirds of Nutreco's Dollars 2.3m of sales is in its animal feeds
business, a mature market where the company is involved in a straight fight
for market share.
The other third of the business is in what CINven believes is the growth
market supplying fish feed, an area that will benefit from growing demand
for fish. It operates salmon farms in Canada and Chile.
BP is being paid Dollars 425m, but the venture capitalists are raising an
additional Dollars 125m for a working capital facility.
CINven says the proportion of debt in the deal is in line with the market
norm - a debt to equity ratio of between 1-to-1 and 2-to-1 - although it
appears to be higher given the large working capital facility.
BP Nutrition still has a Thai shrimp farming operation and a US fish trading
arm which it wants to sell, but yesterday's disposal marks its effective
withdrawal from the sector.
BP's interest in nutrition began in the late 1970s, when it became involved
in a process to turn oil residues into animal feeds. It came at a time of
high oil prices and a trend among oil companies to diversify.
The acquisition of Hendrix in 1979 for about Pounds 60m formed one of two
main pillars of BP's nutrition division. The other was the purchase in 1986
of Purina Mills, the largest US animal feeds group. It was sold last year to
a management group for Dollars 425m.
The consumer products group within the division was also bought out by its
managers last year for Pounds 250m, while the European pet foods part of the
business went to Dalgety, the food and agricultural supplies group, for
Pounds 42m.
BP yesterday said there was no sense of failure associated with the
company's diversification into nutrition. It emphasised that there had been
no write-downs on any of the transactions. Two years ago some analysts had
predicted that BP might struggle to find buyers for the businesses.
Disposal proceeds this year now total about Dollars 1bn, compared with a
target of between Dollars 1bn and Dollars 1.5bn. The final figure is likely
to be in the middle of that range, according to company officials.

FT  27 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Higher interest income keeps Pegasus in
black
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A fall from Pounds 1.02m to Pounds 68,000 in pre-tax profits was announced
by Pegasus Group, the USM-quoted accounting software designer, for the half
year to June 30.
The outcome reflected reorganisation within the group, Mr Jonathan
Hubbard-Ford, chief executive, said, with the results last time benefiting
from a contribution from the forms business, sold for Pounds 6.98m in
September 1993.
Operating losses amounted to Pounds 136,000, compared with Pounds 957,000
profits, which included Pounds 607,000 from discontinued activities.
However, the pre-tax figure was after net interest receivable of Pounds
204,000, up from Pounds 60,000.
Turnover fell to Pounds 2.28m, against Pounds 5.3m which included Pounds
1.79m from discontinued operations. There were 'substantial revenues' last
time from the release of the Senior Version 6 upgrade, Mr Hubbard-Ford said.
During the half year the company's focus had remained on product
development. Plans for modernising and extending the range of products were
now finalised, the chief executuve added.
Earnings per share slipped to 0.7p (9.4p); the interim dividend is held at
2p.

FT  27 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Baldwin cuts seasonal deficit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Baldwin, which has interests in tour operating, restaurants, printing and
property, reduced its pre-tax losses from Pounds 2.25m to Pounds 2.17m in
the half year ended April 30.
Mr David Landau, chairman, said that as in previous years the deficit was a
direct result of the group's accounting policy and the seasonality of the
tour operating division.
Group turnover advanced to Pounds 11.4m (Pounds 8.41m) reflecting both
organic growth and a full six month trading from the restaurant division, he
said.
During the second half the restaurant side should benefit from the
refurbishment programme, the elimination of 10 lossmaking units and the
growing popularity of the Simpsons restaurants.
He said all indications were that the group was heading for a record
performance in the current period. Profits were Pounds 2.83m pre-tax for the
year to last October.
Despite losses per share of 7.67p (7.93p) the interim dividend is held at
1.6p.

FT  27 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Leyland Trucks at Pounds 8m and plans to
lift output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leyland Trucks Manufacturing, the truck maker rescued last year by a
management buy-out following the collapse of the Daf group, reported pre-tax
profits of Pounds 8.4m for the 11 months to end-April.
The company, formed in June 1993 with backing from Barclays Development
Capital, had turnover of Pounds 148.6m.
Earlier this year LDV, the Birmingham-based van manufacturer which was
rescued by a separate management buy-out from the Daf receivership, reported
a pre-tax profit of Pounds 8.6m on turnover of Pounds 79.6m in its first
trading period from April to December.
Leyland produced 6,800 trucks over the 11 month period and is planning to
raise output to 8,000 vehicles in the current financial year. The company
has increased its production rate by about 20 per cent, from 30 to 36 trucks
a day, since it was formed last June. The break-even level for production
had been reduced to about 5,500 trucks a year.
Leyland has established three main business areas: the production of its 45
series light trucks for sale through the European dealer network of Daf
Trucks, the Dutch company formed after the collapse of the former Daf group;
the production of military trucks, currently for the Ministry of Defence;
and the production and sale of trucks in world markets outside Europe.
The company expects to sell 7,000 trucks through the Daf network this year
and forecasts that the total will rise sharply in 1995 and 1996. It has
established trading agreements in Africa and east Asia and has secured
orders from 22 countries worth some Pounds 11m.
Mr John Gilchrist, chief executive, said that 'sales volumes are increasing
in all our major markets, although the proportion of our income from the UK
military will diminish at the end of the current contract'.

FT  27 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Bridging the culture gap between west and
east - Tackling Asia's tigers / TI Group hopes to gain entry to the Chinese
market by forming links in Singapore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With sales of Pounds 100m and 2,000 employees in its own or associated
companies across the Asia Pacific, TI Group is no stranger to the region.
But it recognises the advantages of a helping hand to develop its position
still further.
In February, it found one in the shape of Sembawang Group, a big
Singapore-based industrial conglomerate in which the Singapore government
indirectly holds a majority stake. The two companies signed a memorandum of
understanding to develop business opportunities together in the region,
focusing initially on Singapore and China.
As such, the deal represents yet another recent initiative by a UK
engineering company to tackle the booming regional market. But by linking
with Sembawang, TI is also participating in the regional thrust which the
Singapore government is encouraging among local companies.
TI's businesses have long been active in the region. The John Crane seals
business established its first operations there 27 years ago, and its
seven-year-old joint venture in Tianjin is China's largest seals
manufacturer. Bundy, which makes automotive tubing and systems, has a number
of ventures in the region and both the TI companies are well-known names.
The newest addition to the TI fold, Dowty, has the region's only independent
service and repair facility capable of handling landing gear from
wide-bodied jets. Recently expanded, it is close to Singapore's Changi
airport.
TI believes the region offers strong growth opportunities for all three of
its core businesses, and in recognition of this has created a new full-time
post of executive director - Asia Pacific. This kind of post has rapidly
become a typical feature of UK engineering companies' approach to the
region.
The first incumbent, Mr Mark Ellsmore, took up the post in May, to pursue
the Sembawang initiative and ensure group resources are allocated to other
strategic opportunities in the region.
At first glance, the TI-Sembawang group would seem to bring together two
very odd bedfellows - a tightly-focused UK specialist engineer and a huge
industrial conglomerate with interests ranging from shipbuilding to
warehousing.
But there are striking similarities in the energetic qualities of the deal's
two architects - Sir Christopher Lewinton, TI's chairman, and Mr Philip Yeo,
who is chairman both of Singapore's influential Economic Development Board
and Sembawang Group. Successful meetings between the two men in London and
Singapore clinched the deal.
Now the deal is completed, it is up to top executives in the region to make
it work. One of them is Mr John Wilson, president of Singapore-based John
Crane Asia Pacific.
'We have knowledgeable people here, and all three divisions have exposure to
China,' he says. 'But the link-up with Sembawang gives us extra knowledge
and a different approach to the market.'
'We are able to draw on a pool of Chinese speakers. And Sembawang are able
to take an objective view of our businesses, because they are not experts in
them. We bring that expertise.'
Singaporeans are very acceptable in all parts of China, he says, not only
because they speak Mandarin, but because Singapore is seen as a success
achieved by ethnic Chinese people.
On top of that, the Chinese business culture is very different from that of
Taiwan, Hong Kong or Singapore, he says. Guanxi - the Chinese for
relationships, contacts, networking - was important throughout the business
world but probably more important in China than any other aspect of doing
business, and establishing such relationships was easier between Chinese.
Mr Chun Loong Lai, president of Sembawang Industrial, agrees that knowing
the culture and the language helps bridge the gap between west and east. 'We
have proven that we can convert western technology and management systems
into the regional environment, and are able to guide the western company and
the receiving party for the technology in the region,' he says.
The close working relationship between TI and Sembawang is functioning well,
and in its early days is focusing very much on China, as discussions on
activity in Singapore are still in an embryonic stage, says Mr Wilson.
None of the projects can be identified yet, but the collaboration with
Sembawang is aimed at allowing John Crane to expand its operations in China
into other industrialised provinces beyond the Tianjin region, while Bundy
wants to enter the Chinese automotive market in conjunction with Sembawang.
Executives from Bundy and John Crane have visited China together with
Sembawang officials, and Mr Wilson envisages more manufacturing of
mechanical seals in China, and of automotive tubing systems by Bundy - which
needs to manufacture close to its customers so that it can deliver its brake
and fuel line systems on a 'just-in-time' basis.
In Bundy, says Mr Lai, 'TI has one of the top names in tubing, and the
automotive industry in China is growing. It makes sense to examine the
business, bring the parties together, and participate with them in going
into China.'
Both sides stress that the agreement does not limit them to China and
Singapore, and Dowty could become part of the deal at some time in the
future, says Mr Wilson.
But neither TI nor Sembawang has unlimited resources, and a focused approach
to a manageable number of projects, rather than a large number of shallow
collaborations on a broad front, is important and necessary, he says.
'We've picked a handful of projects where we believe we can be winners, he
says. Once we've got a couple of successes under our belts, who knows where
it will go?'
Mr Lai suggests one result of the collaboration could be a TI design centre
in Singapore, which would attract Singapore tax incentives.
Mr Wilson believes both John Crane and Bundy are ahead of their competitors
in exploiting the Chinese market. 'There are no other international
mechanical seal companies with substantial joint ventures in China,' he
says. 'It was a somewhat enlightened view in 1987 by TI to go into the
venture, which had taken four years to negotiate.'
Bundy's competitors in China are mainly Japanese companies, which are
'sniffing around,' says Mr Wilson. But in a customer-led business Bundy has
a strategic advantage as most of the foreign car manufacturers in China are
European or US, which know Bundy well. With Sembawang, Bundy has visited
Volkswagen, Citroen and Peugeot plants in China, says Mr Lai, and more
visits were planned.
Even with this strong position, the deal with Sembawang would enable TI to
move its plans forward faster and more effectively, particularly in China,
says Mr Wilson.
In any case, though, he believes both TI divisions can achieve growth in the
region significantly ahead of average GNP growth of 7 per cent. 'A number of
developing markets are moving from lower to higher technology, which is good
for our products,' he says.
In seals, environmental issues and the need for greater efficiency and
consistency in process industries makes mechanical seals increasingly
preferable to the cheaper packings, while Bundy has not only the lure of
serving the region's automotive industries but, subsequently, the prospects
of supplying tubing to the region's refrigerator industry.
Economic growth suggests this will grow rapidly - after a TV, a refrigerator
is the next thing that gets bought by households as living standards rise,
says Mr Wilson.

FT  27 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Circulation of Body Shop article restricted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US magazine due to publish a critical article on Body Shop International
next week will not distribute copies in any Commonwealth country in an
attempt to avoid British libel laws.
Speculation about the contents of an article in Business Ethics, the
Minneapolis-based magazine, and articles expected to be printed in other
publications has helped trigger controversy around Body Shop over the last
few days.
Business Ethics said yesterday that it was going ahead with its plans to
carry the article, written by Mr Jon Entine, a US journalist, on Thursday.
It has refused requests from Body Shop, as well as many journalists and
other organisations, to see copies of the article before publication.
However, it is believed to have decided to prevent circulation in any of the
countries of the Commonwealth after seeking legal advice.
The US constitution prevents any attempt to obtain an injunction to forbid
publication of the article in advance.
The magazine, with a distribution of about 14,000, published a highly
positive piece on Ms Anita Roddick and the Body Shop two years ago.
It says that next week's article 'does raise questions about the Body Shop's
policies and practices' but does so 'in a fair and balanced way' with
supporting documentation.
Body Shop's shares closed down 3p at 218p yesterday. They were 242p on
Thursday a week ago before details about the articles began to emerge.

FT  27 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Deregulation row casts doubts over Dairy
Crest flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Milk Marketing Board yesterday appeared to rule out an early flotation
of its Dairy Crest subsidiary.
Speaking after Thursday's talks with the government on the industry's
deregulation, Mr Andrew Dare, MMB chief executive, said he thought that
floating the dairy foods arm before November would mean working towards an
extremely tight timetable.
There had until recently been hopes that a sale could be achieved by
November 1, when the deregulation of the industry is due to be effected.
However, the row over deregulation has convinced many within the industry
that a flotation is unlikely this year and may not happen at all.
Some analysts believe that the uncertainty and the rise in prices that the
Dairy Trades Federation is protesting about will increase the chances of a
management buy-out at Dairy Crest, valued by some analysts at more than
Pounds 250m.
However, a likely fall in profits this year - last year it made Pounds 39.8m
at the operating level - will depress the potential proceeds if a flotation
is made in the near future.
Thursday's government talks between the Dairy Trades Federation and the MMB,
soon to be replaced by a voluntary co-operative of dairy producers called
Milk Marque, ended with Mr William Waldegrave, the agriculture minister,
promising to consult with his ministerial colleagues.
The DTF has threatened to take the government to court over the deregulation
and Mr Waldegrave has said a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission cannot be ruled out.

FT  27 AUG 94 / UK Company News: BM to reduce debt via Pounds 17m disposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of a rights issue this year to complete the revival of BM
Group, the engineering company in refinancing talks with its bankers,
receded yesterday as the group announced the surprise sale of its dumper
truck manufacturing business.
BM had been widely expected to announce a Pounds 20m rights issue as part of
the refinancing. The sale of Benford to Powerscreen, which makes screening
and stone-crushing equipment, for a net Pounds 17m in cash and shares now
makes a rights issue to reduce debt unnecessary. However, BM could still
call on shareholders next year for funds to expand its ongoing businesses.
Mr Cliff Walker, chief executive, said the group would 'not shy away' from a
cash call if the appropriate opportunity arose. 'I can see a situation, once
the right acquisition is in our sights, where we may need to return to
shareholders.'
BM almost collapsed last year from the effects of the Pounds 60m acquisition
in 1990 of Blackwood Hodge, the construction equipment distributor, which,
it has been estimated, has cost BM up to Pounds 100m. It is considering
possible litigation against Hambros, the merchant bank which recommended the
purchase.
Under new management, virtually all of the Blackwood Hodge businesses have
been sold or closed down. As part of the restructuring programme in 1993 -
which guaranteed bankers' support for short-term finance to the end of this
December - the group pledged to withdraw from distribution and reduce the
Pounds 120m debt.
The disposal announced yesterday, combined with the sale of a US distributor
in July, will cut some Pounds 28m from the Pounds 65m debt to be announced
at the annual results in October. Net assets are estimated to be about
Pounds 70m, including a Pounds 31m pension fund surplus.
BM will receive Pounds 12.8m in cash and 1.4m Powerscreen shares with a
guaranteed disposal value of at least Pounds 4.2m. The cash will be used to
eliminate the Pounds 12.9m intercompany loan from BM to Benford. BM is
expected to take a Pounds 1.1m write-down on the disposal.
Mr Walker said BM expected more than Pounds 4.2m from the sale of the shares
over a six to nine-month period.
BM has written to shareholders reassuring them of its commitment to its
other core industrial machinery manufacturing businesses.
Mr Walker also said the refinancing talks were progressing well and an
announcement was hoped for soon. BM is expected to sell at least one of the
last three small Blackwood Hodge businesses shortly.

FT  27 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Two acquisitions and change of name for BTG
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER FRANKLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business Technology Group, the photocopier and facsimile sales and service
company, announced yesterday that it was to make two acquisitions and change
its name to Berkeley Business Group.
At the same time it reported a reduced pre-tax loss of Pounds 96,000 on
turnover of Pounds 5.98m for the half year to June 30 against restated
losses of Pounds 233,000 on turnover of Pounds 8.76m.
In its first significant expansion since the installation of a new
management team last October, the group is acquiring Captain Cargo, a parcel
and freight delivery service, and Photostatic (EMG), a photocopier servicing
company.
The consideration for Captain Cargo is Pounds 8.3m, to be satisfied by
Pounds 5m in cash with the balance settled by the issue of 34.7m new
ordinary shares.
Photostatic is to be acquired for Pounds 1.53m - Pounds 1.13m of which will
be paid in cash, with the balance made up of 4.71m new ordinary shares.
To fund the cash element of the acquisitions and provide fresh working
capital, BTG is to raise about Pounds 10m via a placing of 143m new ordinary
shares at 7p apiece.
Of these, some 72m have been placed firm and 71m have been conditionally
placed subject to clawback on a 9-for-10 basis. The placing has been
underwritten by Guinness Mahon.
In the year to end-December 1993 Captain Cargo made a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 1.3m on turnover of Pounds 15.1m, while Photostatic reported profits
of Pounds 51,000 pre-tax on turnover of Pounds 2.08m.
For the first half, BTG's operating profits were Pounds 42,000 compared with
losses of Pounds 92,000. Losses per share emerged at 0.12p (1.02p).
BTG's shares were suspended at 8 1/2p at the company's request pending
shareholders' approval of the acquisitions and fund raising.
As part of the transaction Mr Malcolm Burge, managing director of Captain
Cargo, will join the board of BTG.

FT  27 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Sunleigh rises 30% to Pounds 270,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sunleigh, the leisure products company, reported pre-tax profits up by 30
per cent from Pounds 208,000 to Pounds 270,000 for the six months to
end-June.
The outcome was struck on turnover down from Pounds 8.94m to Pounds 7.98m,
although last year's figure included Pounds 263,000 from discontinued

Earnings per share increased from 0.05p to 0.12p, reflecting the lower
proportion of group profits derived from Gavel, in which there is a 36 per
cent minority shareholder.
The Pounds 17.9m acquisition of Maclaren Group, the pushchairs maker, was
completed on June 30, when the shares gained a full listing.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Banks must pre-notify on charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr LOCKSLEY RYAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There has been much comment in recent weeks regarding the banks'
standards of charges and service (Editorial: 'Bank raids', August 23, 'Brown
pledges to curb bank charges', August 22). Some of that comment is
justified, but not all. No bank should be complacent about the level of
service it offers and all should strive constantly to improve.
Unlike the rest of the commercial market, most banks do not notify customers
before a charge is made. Naturally, customers would prefer not to pay
charges at all, but our research shows that by notifying them before the
amount is debited many problems are overcome.
TSB was the first to introduce pre-notification of all charges in February.
Others are now doing so. Little attention has been paid to the benefit to
customers of pre-notification. All banks must rectify this if we are to
avoid the criticism of charging practices.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: EU tape levy too burdensome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Emma Tucker ('Blank tape prices may rise if EU supports levy plan',
August 18) was fairer than Mr Bickerton (Letters, August 24) suggests. But
she quoted an interesting comment from the Commission to the effect 'we
shall try to (harmonise the levy) at a level that is not too exaggerated'.
This is fine, but not matched by reality: the Commission is thinking of a
26.3 per cent rate on the trade value of audio tapes and 45.8 per cent on
video tapes. These rates, which average out at more than 39 per cent for
audio and video tapes together, contrast with 3 per cent in the US and
Japan. The EU wants to impose more than 10 times this rate.
The EU is sometimes criticised for shooting itself in the foot by placing
hefty burdens on its own industries. This would be a classic example.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Passionate talk, little action: James Harding explains
domestic forces shaping US policy on Cuba
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The last time Cuban and US leaders sat down together was to celebrate the
triumph of co-operation over conflict. The achievement, however, was not
theirs. Under Pretoria's blue sky, Cuban President Fidel Castro and US
Vice-President Al Gore, among others, shared the wonder of Nelson Mandela's
inauguration as South Africa's first democratically-elected president.
In a year of handshakes between old enemies, the failure of the US and Cuban
governments to end their cold war bickering has been an exception.
The flood of refugees leaving the island over the past two weeks and, the US
commitment to shelter them indefinitely, has once again exposed the
anachronism of US Cuba policy and the domestic forces which shape it.
The Clinton administration last week came to terms with one consequence of a
tough stance on Cuban immigration. It announced that in future Cubans were
not going to be granted access to the US but would be detained at the
country's naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Nevertheless people kept
coming in increasing numbers and the US is having to prepare for a small
city of Cuban refugees to be maintained until they can be repatriated.
When and under what circumstances that repatriation will take place is
unclear. The last time US-Cuba relations approached anything like harmony
was in 1934. Then the US agreed to drop its right to intervene in the
country's affairs and, in return, had the lease on its Guantanamo military
base reaffirmed.
President Clinton backs the trade embargo imposed on Cuba since 1963,
following Castro's nationalisation of US land on the island, and, during the
1992 presidential election, was more enthusiastic than George Bush in
backing the Cuban Democracy Act of that year. The act tightened the embargo
by prohibiting overseas subsidiaries of US companies from selling goods to
Cuba - but to increase the scope for a propaganda drive against the country
allowed telecommunication links with the US.
Unlike other economic sanctions imposed by the US - against Iraq or former
Yugoslavia for example - the strategic aim of the embargo on Cuba is
unclear. Asked what Cuba must do to bring an end to the embargo, Mr Clinton
said only: 'Mr Castro knows the conditions for changing that policy.' State
Department officials were equally vague; they wanted 'demonstrated evidence
of Castro's commitment to change'.
One camp that does have a clear idea of what US Cuba policy should entail is
led by Mr Robert Torricelli, Democratic Congressman from New Jersey and
sponsor of the Cuban Democracy Act. He wants to force the collapse of the
Cuban economy in the belief that, when conditions become intolerable, its
population will rise up and overthrow their oppressor.
But the prospect of a mass uprising in a neighbouring country causes concern
in Washington. The Central Intelligence Agency last year warned the
president that serious instability on the island would have 'an immediate
impact' on the US, spilling as many as 80,000 refugees and embroiling him in
demands for US military intervention.
There are also reports of dissent in the National Security Council, which
co-ordinates foreign and military policy for the president.
On Capitol Hill, the embargo is also under attack. Senator Chris Dodd, the
Connecticut Democrat, has criticised the inconsistency of negotiating
nuclear issues with North Korea and granting China the commercial advantages
of Most Favoured Nation status, but not talking to Cuba. He advocates
exploring 'the possibility of reaching some rapprochement'.
The White House, however, is aware of dangers of softening its policy on
Cuba. Mr Warren Christopher, US Secretary of State, was deputy secretary at
the same department duringthe Carter administration that developed informal
links with Havana - only to discover Cuba was sending 100,000 troops to
assist the civil war in Ethiopia and to have Castro allow a flood of 125,000
Cubans to leave the country for the US from the port of Mariel in 1980. The
Mariel exodus was a contributory factor in Jimmy Carter's subsequent
election defeat.
Mr Clinton too has his own scars from Mariel. After a riot at a Cuban
refugee camp in Arkansas in 1980, sentiment turned against the state
governor who was blamed for playing host to the Cubans. Partly as a result,
Governor Clinton lost his campaign for re-election in 1980.
More recently, Mr Clinton has realised the benefits of talking tough on
Havana. His support for the Cuban Democracy Act won funding and votes from
the traditionally Republican Cuban American community in Miami. Florida is
an important state for the Democrats: though Mr Clinton lost it narrowly in
the 1992 presidential election (with 39.2 per cent of the vote to George
Bush's 40.9 per cent) it will be a target in the 1996 contest.
More immediately, Florida's Democrat governor Lawton Chiles faces a strong
challenge from Mr Jeb Bush (son of the former president) in November's
gubernatorial election - and Mr Chiles is keen to play the Cuban card for
votes. Ten days ago he demanded federal action to help the state cope with
the flood of Cuban immigrants, successfully pre-empting Mr Clinton's
decision to slam the doors shut.
Similar political considerations would explain why Mr Clinton and Mr Chiles
have kept Mr Jorge Mas Canosa, the Cuban American community's most prominent
politician and businessman, on board. Support from Mr Mas Canosa's Cuban
American National Foundation, the community's most powerful lobby and
strongest advocate of the embargo, will be an important consideration in
November's congressional, as well as gubernatorial, elections.
Mr Charles Rangel, Democratic Representative from New York, says breaking
with conservatives in the Cuban American community and opening talks with
Havana to stimulate a free market and political democracy in Cuba would be
proof of Mr Clinton's statesmanship.
Mr Clinton is unlikely to respond to such a challenge. Though the Caribbean
is increasingly becoming Mr Clinton's equivalent to Ronald Reagan's central
America, there still seems little political benefit from intervention. Among
US voters, apathy is still more common than anti-communist derision when it
comes to Cuba.
In the short term, the administration may just hope that the bad weather
holds out long enough to deter people from leaving Cuba. If large numbers
continue to come, Mr Clinton will probably look to his allies in the
Americas and to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to share
the Cuban burden.
Democratic Senator Paul Simon of Illinois, who has supported calls for a
dialogue, said on Thursday he feared that isolating one of the world's last
revolutionary Communist strongholds was 'a response to the national passion
rather than the national interest'. Two months away from Congressional
mid-terms and a string of gubernatorial elections, satisfying that national
passion by talking tough and doing little may well be the administration's
priority on Cuba.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Big enough to deliver - small enough
to care
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD GOAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read the editorial 'England's local shambles' (August 25) with great
interest. It is sad that the British trait of resistance to change at all
costs once again rears its head.
As an employee of local government at county and district level for many
years, I am all too aware of the shortcomings of the present two-tier system
that breeds inefficiency, lack of accountability and duplication of service
provision. This system does not best serve the needs of our customers - the
council tax and business rate payers. The opportunity was missed in 1974 to
dispatch this archaic system to the history books, primarily as a result of
political desire to retain control through the shire counties. If the
opportunity to introduce unitary authorities is again squandered, then the
public who pay the cost cannot subsequently complain if these inefficiencies
continue.
Most of the businesses with which I deal are aware of the frustrations and
inconsistencies that result from the need to negotiate their way around two
authorities, whether they wish to seek financial support, achieve planning
permission, require information on current legislation or avoid falling foul
of conditions and constraints imposed differently at county and district
level. They see the way local decisions and local accountability works in
the US and Europe, and often seek to invest overseas rather than become
trapped amid this confusion.
In all situations the cost of change is easily quantifiable and the
potential financial benefit can only be a projection. To use that as an
argument not to make progress and introduce change would have resulted in
the retention of mud huts, bows and arrows, and horses as a means of
transport. Let us grasp the nettle and introduce a unitary system of local
government that is efficient and serves the needs of the people who pay the
bills.

Sir, A number of newspaper reports have recently made reference to
'compassion fatigue'. Certainly there are times when the world's problems
seem too large fully to contemplate. But perhaps the tragedy that unites all
the tragedies is our inability to learn from what has gone before.
I read in the past few days:
'To hinder insurrection by driving away the people, and to govern peaceably
by having no subjects, is an expedient that argues no great profundity of
politics. It affords a legislator little self-applause to consider that
where there was formerly an insurrection, there is now a wilderness.'

FT  27 AUG 94 / All change in the pits: Kevin Done on the uncoupling of
Benetton cars and Ford engines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the brittle world of Formula One motor racing, the most surprising
feature of the relationship between Benetton Formula and Ford was that it
lasted so long.
Benetton's announcement this week that it was renouncing Ford, its engine
supplier for the past eight years, in favour of Renault, shocked only
because the partnership appeared finally to have found the elusive winning
formula this year.
The combination of a competitive chassis from Benetton, the most
accomplished driver in the championship in Michael Schumacher, and a
reliable - and this year more powerful - engine from Ford and its partner
Cosworth, has brought seven victories in the first 10 races of the season.
On the grid of the Belgian grand prix at Spa Francorchamps tomorrow, the
Benetton-Ford team will still be intact, with the unfinished business of
winning this year's championship. Behind the pit lane, however, the
machinations have already moved to 1995.
Renault's coup of agreeing two contracts within weeks of each other to
supply engines for the next three years to both Benetton and Williams will
be difficult to trump, but it remains to be seen how long the French
carmaker can run with both the hare and the hounds.
Renault has won the world championship for the past two years with Williams,
in 1992 with Nigel Mansell and last year with Alain Prost at the wheel, and
it is desperate to remain on the winner's podium.
Ambition is naked in Formula One: there are no prizes for second place. The
manoeuvring is ruthless. 'The objective is to win grand prix and to be
champion of the world,' says Mr Patrick Faure, director of Renault Sport.
'Our presence in Formula One is only justified by winning. Competition is
increasing and it is necessary to give all our efforts to winning with the
knowhow of Benetton and the talent of Michael Schumacher.'
Such a statement is hardly likely to create a sense of ease in the Williams
camp. Renault promises that both Benetton and Williams will receive
identical works V10 engines next year, and that both will be treated as
'works teams', but in practice it has probably already cooked up a recipe
for high octane behind-the-scenes conflict.
The parting of the ways between Benetton and Ford was also the culmination
of many months of growing unease. It is understood that Mr Jacques Nasser,
then chairman of Ford of Europe, had warned Mr Flavio Briatore, flamboyant
managing director of Benetton Formula, as long ago as last November that
Ford was unwilling to continue supplying engines beyond 1994, unless the
conditions of the alliance changed.
'After eight years, relations had worn thin,' says one executive close to
the team. 'There were continual frustrations. You would like to have Michael
Schumacher driving for you for the next five to 10 years. He is going to be
a megastar, but the price was too high.'
For the so-called 'works team' in F1 the engine maker pays for the
development and manufacture of the engine at its own cost. In return it gets
access to joint R&amp;D, representation, the prominent placement of its name,
and endorsements from drivers and team - Schumacher as-sures the world that
his favourite car really is a Ford Scorpio. The go-faster version of the
Renault Clio becomes the Clio Williams.
Ford felt increasingly that it was being short-changed. Drivers were not
always turning up for Ford events when promised, the Ford oval logo did not
seem to get the proper prominence. One of Benetton's controversial
advertisements featured a Mafia car-bomb ex-plosion in Sicily. The car was
recognisably a Ford Escort: 2,000 posters were pulled down in 48 hours when
Ford Germany sounded the alarm.
Last year Ford's misgivings were not being assuaged by success on the track.
With full Ford backing as works team, Benetton managed only one victory. In
contrast, Ron Dennis's McLaren team - no longer powered by Honda - found
itself without a works engine. It paid for a Ford power unit and, with a
lesser specification than Benetton's works engine, won five of 16 races with
Ayrton Senna as driver.
There was also a growing sense of insecurity for Benetton. The US carmaker
had been undergoing one of its periodic bouts of soul-searching over the
level of its commitment to Formula One, and Benetton could not afford to be
left stranded. In the event, Benetton has gone from success to success this
year, and Ford has decided to maintain its F1 commitment, but too late to
save the partnership.
One route could see Ford team up with McLaren. The world champion for seven
of eight years between 1984 and 1991 - powered first by Porsche and then by
Honda - has had a trying season with Peugeot, Renault's arch domestic rival.
'The joke of the pit lane this season has been to guess on what lap the
Peugeot engine will expire,' says one rival team member.
The Ford package is attractive. Its V8 engine is currently powering the
winning team. It has forged a fruitful, long-standing partnership with
Cosworth Engineering, the Vickers subsidiary, which engineers and
manufactures the engines, and its electronics resources match the best. The
computer screens in the Ford telemetry truck behind the pits monitor the
performance of its engines in real time.
'It's like having a runner in the London marathon linked up to a heart
machine with doctors alongside to warn that you are about to have a systems
failure, or you need more water or whatever,' says a team executive.
For next season Ford must now find a new runner, while for the moment, at
least, Renault has acquired Michael Schumacher, the hottest property in
Formula One - as long as he goes on winning.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Three or more easy, democratic ways
to reform the House of Lords
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW BARNARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Roland Rudd's article, 'Time to go, m'lords' (August 25), argues that
there is no democratic alternative to outright abolition of the House of
Lords.
Yet as the article explains, the main problem is that peerages are
determined largely by birth.
So wouldn't the most appropriate response be to recruit peers on a more
equitable basis?
Ideally, perhaps, anyone who wanted to sit in the Lords should be given a
peerage. Such a reform would be impeccably democratic. It would also offer
prime ministers a wealth of talent from which they could select their
cabinet ministers.
Unfortunately, stricter selection criteria might be needed to keep down
running costs.
One solution, which is similar to Tony Benn's proposal, would be to offer a
peerage to anyone who supported government policies.
However, this would not be so democratic and there might be an insufficient
number of applicants.
The market solution would be to hold competitive auctions for peerages,
which could become a useful source of public finance. Lloyd George is
alleged to have experimented along these lines.
A more modern approach might be to privatise the auctions so as to diminish
the scope for political influence.
But would there be enough MPs prepared to free the Lords from the dead hand
of the state?
My suggestion would be to set an age threshold for new peerages. Anyone
reaching an appropriate age - say, 95 - would be automatically elevated to
the Lords on their birthday.
It would be interesting to see whether anybody noticed the difference.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Bricks thrown at the mouse: UK amusement parks fear Lego
more than Disney
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When he became general manager of Thorpe Park in 1988, Mr Colin Dawson
started wearing a Mickey Mouse watch to remind himself what he was up
against.
He and his team at the Surrey-based theme park, like their counterparts
elsewhere in the UK, watched the 1992 opening of Euro Disney nervously. Two
years later, they take a more relaxed view of the Paris theme park, whose
poor financial performance has brought it pages of bad publicity.
Mr Dawson, who still wears the Mickey Mouse watch, can afford a touch of
schadenfreude at Euro Disney's plight. He says: 'I think their egos
prevented them from seeing what some of the problems would be.'
Despite the competition from across the Channel - Euro Disney attracts
nearly 10m visitors a year - the UK's three largest theme parks all enjoyed
record attendance figures last year.
Alton Towers, based in Staffordshire, saw attendances rise 5 per cent to
2.6m in 1993. This year's figure is expected to be higher, after the opening
this spring of the Nemesis ride, which gives customers the feeling of
weightlessness as it hurls them around. Surrey-based Chessington World of
Adventures - which, like Alton Towers, is owned by the Pearson group,
publisher of the FT - had 1.5m visitors last year, up 28 per cent on the
year before. Thorpe Park, a subsidiary of concrete producer RMC, received
1.3m customers, compared with fewer than 1.2m in 1992. While neither parent
group releases profit figures for the parks, all three say their owners are
happy with their financial performance.
In retrospect, they say the opening of Euro Disney may even have helped
them. Ms Lesley Morisetti, Chessington's marketing manager, says the press
and television coverage of Euro Disney helped to explain to British parents
what a theme park was. Many had memories of the seedy seaside amusement
parks of their youth. Euro Disney demonstrated to a wide audience that there
was now something new on offer: clean, safe, well-run amusement attractions.
Some of the press coverage of Euro Disney mentioned that Britain also had
theme parks worth visiting. Ms Morisetti says: 'On balance, Euro Disney has
done us a lot of good.'
While Euro Disney introduced many Britons to the company's attractions,
others already knew them well, having visited Disney parks in Florida or
California. Ms Morisetti estimates that 20 per cent of visitors to
Chessington have been to a Disney park. Their experiences of the US Disney
attractions had already raised expectations of what a British theme park
should offer.
The three large UK parks say that the Disney organisation has taught them
much of what they know about grouping attractions in areas with different
themes - such as Calamity Canyon at Chessington and Fantasy Reef at Thorpe
Park.
Disney's influence can be seen in all three parks. Thorpe Park has been the
most open in its adoption of Disney ways. Like Disney, it calls its
employees 'cast members'. Its rules on employee appearance and dress sound
similar to those in force at Euro Disney.
Thorpe Park's employee booklet says men's hair must be one inch above their
collars at all times. It adds: 'Tails of hair plaited with beads, step or
graded hairstyles are not permitted. Extreme hair colours are not allowed.'
Unlike Euro Disney, Thorpe Park allows beards, provided employees grow them
during the winter when the park is closed.
While the quality of the rides is high at all three parks, none is able to
offer the well-known characters that Disney can. Alton Towers had a mascot
called Henry Hound, but Ms Jill Britton, the park's marketing director,
says: 'He has gone to the great dog kennel in the sky. He just wasn't strong
enough.' The park is now introducing Beatrix Potter characters instead.
There are other ways in which the UK parks fall short of the Euro Disney
standard. None manages to be quite as clean as Euro Disney. Thorpe Park
comes closest, but during a visit in early summer, parts of Alton Towers had
litter which would not have been tolerated at the Paris park.
Mr Andrew Hollingsworth, Alton Towers' divisional director, says the litter
problems are the result of staffing difficulties. The park has had problems
this summer attracting employees: the park is closed in the winter and
working only part of the year is not an attractive proposition for
work-seekers at a time when the economy is improving.
The other two theme parks say they have no difficulty attracting staff for
only part of the year. The large student population in the south of England
means there is a pool of people happy to work in the summer months.
Chessington and Thorpe Park say they also have little trouble recruiting
non-student employees in the spring and autumn.
The UK parks claim they have avoided two of the causes of Euro Disney's
financial difficulties. First, unlike Euro Disney, they do not stay open in
the winter. Mr Dawson dismisses Euro Disney's claim that the weather does
not affect theme park attendance.
Second, the UK groups have not built hotels at the parks. Euro Disney has
six, which it has struggled to fill. Alton Towers is building one 175-room
hotel. Because 20 per cent of its visitors stay for two days, it says it
should have no difficulty filling it.
There is something, however, that worries the two south of England parks:
the planned opening of Lego World on the site of the former Windsor Safari
Park in 1996. Lego, the Danish manufacturer of the toy building bricks, is
basing the British park on its Legoland park in Jutland, which draws about
1.2m visitors a year. Lego World will be the company's first park outside
Denmark. Like Thorpe Park and Chessington, Lego World is expected to appeal
to day-trippers from the surrounding area.
Chessington has requested planning permission to expand its offerings to
counter the threat from Lego. Mr Dawson has been to Lego's park in Denmark
and was impressed by what he saw. Thorpe Park will have to work hard to hold
on to its market. He says: 'We're a lot more concerned about the arrival of
Lego World than we ever were about Euro Disney.'

FT  27 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Negotiating the recovery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Beyond Reasonable Doubt, the title of Lord Archer's first play, may no
longer describe his chances of joining another government, but it does a
good job of summing up the prospects for the UK recovery. With real growth
exceeding predictions, and inflation undershooting them, two years of
healthy economic growth seem all but certain. The forecast for the
government, however, is as doubt-laden as ever.
Monday's news that the economy grew more quickly than expected in the year
to June was a pleasant follow-up to the previous week's surprisingly subdued
July inflation figures. Real GDP is now thought to be growing at an annual
rate of 3.7 per cent: earlier estimates had put it at 3.3 per cent. The
August survey of monthly trends in manufacturing from the Confederation of
British Industry did little to spoil the rosy picture. A higher proportion
of respondents expect to raise output in the coming four months than at any
time since the recovery began.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, may be less enthralled with 'trickle-down
economics' than his predecessor, but any government tends to expect good
economic news to trickle down on to its popularity. Yesterday's Mori poll,
indicating another record low in the Conservatives' popularity, scotched
that theory again. The opposition's current 33 percentage point lead
contrasts with the three-point Tory lead at the end of the second quarter of
1992, when the economy first edged out of recession.
Conservative MPs will be pinning their hopes on Mr Kenneth Clarke,
chancellor of the exchequer, to revive the relationship between economics
and politics, with tax cuts by the November 1995 budget, if not before. He
will be able to oblige them, without jeopardising the economy's longer run
stability, only if the economy's traditional Achilles heels - the current
account and public sector borrowing - prove less troublesome than history
would suggest. On the first, there are indeed grounds for optimism, none of
them conclusive. On the second, the government's own commitments have put it
on a precarious path.
Favourable surprises
The downward Pounds 600m revision to the UK's current account deficit in
1993, which was announced on Monday, does not significantly affect the
combined Pounds 10.3bn shortfall in net exports for that year. But observers
have been revising their expectations for medium-term export growth in the
wake of the week's other favourable surprises. The CBI now predicts the
volume of goods sold abroad to grow by 6 per cent this year and next. There
was some justification for this in its own survey, which found favourable
growth in export orders. More significant, however, is the fact that the
largest continental European countries are emerging from recession faster
than previously thought.
French and German consumers may prove happier to splash out on consumer
goods in the coming year, as their economies revive, than their counterparts
in Britain. That would certainly be the preferred out-turn.
Feel-good factor
The trouble is that the current account is not the government's only
concern. It is also worried by the lack of a 'feel-good factor' in the
recovery this far. For all that it has been consumption-led: consumer
expenditure accounted for over three-quarters of the 1.9 per cent growth in
GDP in 1993, and looks set to provide around two-thirds of this year's
figure. Consumption growth has not been matched in the consumer confidence
figures, largely because the spenders' real incomes were being squeezed at
the same time.
Mr Clarke inflicted much of the pain himself, in the tax increases announced
last November. By 1996, the combined prudence of the last three budgets will
be yielding some Pounds 17bn a year in extra revenue. How much, if anything,
he can give back to the electorate will depend on whether he can stick to
the severe targets for control of public spending which he re-affirmed in
June. In theory, real public spending is to rise a mere 1 per cent a year
over the four years from last November.
Achieving this would make Mr Clarke a more frugal keeper of the public
finances than any chancellor of the 1980s. That alone would appear to
provide good grounds for scepticism. But the fact that he has linked his
efforts to the constraint of headline public sector wage deals means that
the chances of visible failure are even larger than usual. True, the subdued
behaviour of average wages over the past few quarters means that the gap
between public and private sector earnings growth is less than one might
have predicted at the time the policy was imposed. But the shortfall is
likely to provide a growing source of pressure in the public pay rounds
ahead. Certainly, this is a high risk approach.
The conflicts produced by such a blunt-edged instrument of fiscal restraint
are a poor way to revive the public's confidence. Not a Penny More, Not a
Penny Less may have been a bestselling book. It may prove to do less well as
a political strategy.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Man in the News: Plodder with a prototype of reform -
Mexico's President Ernesto Zedillo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER and DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There were two victors in Mexico's presidential elections on Sunday. The
official winner was Mr Ernesto Zedillo, a 42-year-old former budget and
education minister who overcame his lacklustre image to pull off a
convincing victory. The other, with as much at stake, was the current
president Carlos Salinas. After one of the most traumatic years in recent
Mexican history, he looks set to hand over power to his anointed successor
after the cleanest ballot the country has known.
Mr Salinas, whose chances at landing the top job at the nascent World Trade
Organisation have now risen considerably, insists that his successor
deserves credit for the victory. 'He presented a consistent, coherent and
clear programme in a very intense campaign that got close to people,' he
said in an interview this week.
Asked for his judgment on the campaign, Mr Zedillo, betraying his training
as a central banker, first qualifies his answer. 'It's necessary to study
what happened closely. My opinions are very preliminary and have no
scientific basis.' He goes on to credit the strong voter base of his
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) which has ruled Mexico for 65 years,
the favourable popular evaluation of the Salinas government and the overall
campaign. He mentions himself not at all.
Despite the continuity he has promised in economic policy, Mr Zedillo's
style is strikingly different from his predecessor's. Mr Salinas, 46, son of
a cabinet minister, is a scion of one of Mexico's leading political
families. Mr Zedillo, the son of an electrician, rose through state schools
to finish his education at Yale. He appears more introverted and modest than
his predecessor, but often comes across as abrasive.
Mr Zedillo was chosen by Mr Salinas as the ruling party's candidate less
than a week after the murder on March 23 of the president's first choice,
Luis Donaldo Colosio. Having resigned from the cabinet to become Mr
Colosio's campaign manager, Mr Zedillo was the only member of Mr Salinas's
inner circle eligible for the nomination; serving ministers were barred from
running under a constitution which states that, for a minister to contest
the election, he must have resigned at least six months before polling day.
Mr Zedillo denies ever having an inkling that he would be president. He
first considered the possibility 'the day that I was nominated'. But Mr
Zedillo was reported to be the first to arrive at the presidential palace
after the assassination, indicating that the thought of becoming president
may not have been as far from his mind as he claims.
His nomination was opposed by members of the ruling party. A political
loner, who counts the solitary pursuit of long-distance running as his
hobbies, Mr Zedillo had few allies in the PRI, and some enemies. Most of his
supporters in the government were those who like him had doctorates in
economics from US universities.
But Mr Zedillo has faced criticism from a broader front. Mr Enrique Krauze,
a prominent historian, last week described Mr Zedillo as being 'an
honourable man, an intelligent economist and a workaholic. Unfortunately he
is also a man of narrow cultural horizons and vision'.
Mr Krauze, like many Mexicans, was scornful of Mr Zedillo's effort when as
education minister he revised Mexico's outdated school history textbooks.
The new books were withdrawn after criticism that they diminished the role
of Mexico's nationalist heroes, and were riddled with errors.
Mr Zedillo dismisses these criticisms as inventions of the chattering
classes who are out of touch with the real Mexico. 'I say that there are two
Mexicos. One Mexico of the common people. And a Mexico of the cafes of
Mexico City. The real Mexico is the first one, the one that is most
representative.'
Such a view of Mexican society appears to shape Mr Zedillo's approach to
political affairs. He appears convinced that the importance of the New Year
peasant uprising in Chiapas - in which several Mayan Indians seized half a
dozen towns and declared war on the government of President Salinas - has
been exaggerated by the national and foreign press.
'The people who spend all their time in Mexico, who understand its problems,
have a more balanced vision of what is going on here.'
Mr Salinas, for his part, concedes the Chiapas uprising pushed him into
making far-reaching democratic reforms, in an effort to undercut popular
support for the rebels.
'The events of Chiapas might well have provoked a political clampdown, and
it was an option that we had. But we decided the opposite, to open more to
political competition and to advances in democracy. Taking the more
democratic route was a greater risk. But better the risk of democracy than
the risk of stalemate,' said President Salinas.
With the election over, Mr Zedillo has promised to deepen the democratic
reforms that Mr Salinas belatedly embraced. He says this is his central aim
and one on which he is seeking a broad consensus with political opponents.
Mr Zedillo said he will also co-operate with the opposition to advance
reform of the judiciary, wider social policies and further economic
liberalisation. He has also pledged to make the organisation which manages
the elections independent of the government, to push for more equal campaign
conditions for political parties in future elections, a thorough reform of
the PRI, and a devolution of powers to states and municipalities.
Many Mexicans are sceptical of these promises. They point to his expensive
campaign, in which he far outspent the opposition, and the use of
PRI-affiliated unions to compel workers to attend his rallies, as signs that
his commitment to democracy is questionable.
If he proves his critics wrong and carries through his promises of
democratic changes, Mr Zedillo will be voluntarily yielding powers which
President Salinas used to the full. Mr Zedillo has implied that unlike his
predecessor he will not pick PRI candidates for elected positions, nor fire
state governors that have outlived their usefulness to him; he would give
independence to the judiciary, and allow Congress powers to scrutinise
legislation.
For some Mexicans, the manner in which Mr Salinas wielded presidential
power, often with little regard for constitutional and legal constraints, is
his most damaging legacy. By betting that economic growth would disarm
political opposition, Mr Salinas 'ignored the political side of the
equation', says Mr Luis Rubio, a political scientist. 'Many of the ways in
which he solved problems were destructive of the institutions of the
country.'
For all the criticism of Mr Zedillo's plodding style, his supporters say
that he is committed to strengthening Mexico's democratic, legal and local
government institutions. This, says Mr Rubio, is just what it needs and
would mark a fundamental change with the past: 'If there's a prototype of
the person to do this, it is Mr Zedillo.'

FT  27 AUG 94 / Halo slips on the raspberry bubbles: The reputation of Body
Shop has been tarnished by ethical questions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why am I always measured against the standard of Mother Teresa - a standard
by which even saints will fail - and not against those chairmen of companies
who create huge corporate crimes?' pleaded Anita Roddick, founder of Body
Shop International, when her company came under attack in 1992 over its
environmental standards.
She must have asked herself the same question this week. For the past 10
days the natural cosmetics company she founded 18 years ago in Brighton has
been the target of intense publicity, amid claims that the high ethical and
environmental standards it claims to uphold might be less genuine than it
would like the world to think.
What prompted the controversy was the revelation that Franklin Research and
Development Corporation, a US ethical investment adviser which has more than
Dollars 350m in funds under management, had sold its 50,000 Body Shop shares
in mid-July and recommended its clients to do likewise.
The result has been several days of claim and counter-claim trickling into
the press, while Body Shop, Franklin and other ethical research
organisations have been bombarded with calls from journalists. Several US
and UK ethical funds are reviewing their position. Since Thursday a week
ago, the company's shares have dropped from 242p to a closing price of 218p
in London yesterday.
The criticisms appear to pose the biggest threat to the company's
squeaky-clean image since a 1992 documentary on Channel 4. Body Shop
restored its reputation after that attack by winning damages of Pounds
273,000 against the programme makers in a High Court libel action last year.
This week's events raise specific questions about Body Shop practices over
the years, but also much broader ones about how essential a faultlessly
'green' reputation is to the company's success, and how the ethical
investment sector operates.
Franklin's advice to sell Body Shop shares was triggered partly by
commercial factors that would be a consideration for any stock market
analyst. First, it took the view that the company's stock price was already
high for the retail sector at a time of growing competition.
Second, it had seen research which was highly critical of Body Shop, written
by Jon Entine, a US journalist, some of which was scheduled to appear in
Minneapolis-based Business Ethics magazine at the start of next month, with
more details scheduled to appear in other publications over the next few
weeks. Franklin believed that - whether or not the allegations were true -
they would cause the company's share price to fall.
Entine's research questions issues such as where the idea for the Body Shop
originated, the composition of the ingredients in its products, its record
on quality control, animal testing, relations with franchisees, trade with
suppliers in the Third World, charitable donations, environmental policy and
staff working conditions.
Franklin is currently researching the claims and talking to Body Shop about
a piece it is writing for its own Insight newsletter next month, which will
provide an assessment of the ethical standards of the company. It has not
yet determined what its conclusions will be.
However, it has told the Financial Times that it would not have taken the
decision to sell Body Shop shares unless it believed there was a case to
answer. It also stresses that it is still advising clients to sell their
shares. 'We do not sell stock based on every short-term rumour,' said Mr
Patrick McVeigh, senior vice-president.
Franklin's move has brought to an end a long period in which Body Shop
successfully generated a positive image. The tide now appears to have
turned, causing Gordon Roddick, Anita's husband and the chairman of the
company, to dub critics this week 'the zealots of cynicism'.
Body Shop is frustrated that it has not been able to respond in detail
because it has not seen the allegations. 'It is not fair,' says Angela
Bawtree, investor relations manager. 'All we have seen are rumours of
allegations. We have responded as fully as possible.'
It all seems a far cry from the Body Shop of the 1980s, one of the most
successful retail flotations. Its Stock Exchange listing in 1984 and
subsequent rapid expansion proved well-timed, as it capitalised on the
growing consumer demand for stylish and innovative products, coupled with
increasing public awareness of environmental issues.
While some similar niche retailers set up by entrepreneurs in the 1980s,
such as Sophie Mirman's Sock Shop, later ran into financial difficulties,
the progress of Body Shop has been spectacular. Profits increased from
Pounds 1.04m in 1985 to Pounds 29.7m in the year to August 1994, on sales
that have grown from Pounds 4.9m to Pounds 195.4m over the same period.
The company has achieved this success without advertising, instead using the
growing fame of its articulate and energetic founder to sell its products.
Anita Roddick personified the company, and rarely refused interviews.
Newspapers and magazines devoted multi-page spreads to Anita's beauty tips,
what she ate, how she decorated her home, even her favourite films.
The other defining characteristic of the company was its 'green' image. It
used recyclable plastic bottles and urged customers to refill their old ones
rather than buy new ones; it campaigned against testing of products on
animals; it plastered the olive-green interiors of its shops with posters
telling customers to save the whale and the rainforest.
Body Shop's attempts to maintain high ethical standards extend beyond its
environmental policies. The group allows every employee half a day of paid
time off each month to do voluntary work. It donated Pounds 230,000 to
launch the Big Issue, the magazine sold by the homeless, who retain 60 per
cent of its cover price. It has campaigned for all employers to provide
child care, and opened its own 'workplace child development centre'.
One of its most high-profile initiatives is the 'Trade Not Aid' programme of
paying 'fair' market prices for its ingredients from people in developing
countries. However, this idea has attracted the criticism of Mr Richard
Adams, director of New Consumer, a campaigning group based in Newcastle, and
the founder of Traidcraft, which has long specialised in selling food,
clothes and handicrafts bought at 'fair' prices from the Third World.
He argues that - despite the posters and other publicity for its programme -
'Trade not Aid' represents less than 0.1 per cent of Body Shop's trade. The
company replies that it cannot quantify the amount, but that it is 'more
than 1 per cent but less than 10 per cent'.
There is little doubt that Body Shop is far more advanced in promoting
ethical and green causes than most of its competitors - many of which have
since emulated its lead. For example, it is one of a handful of companies to
provide environmental data about its activities, through an annual 'green
book' which complies with new EU guidelines on ecological management and
auditing.
But Mr Adam's disillusionment with the company has come partly because he
claims it has repeatedly refused to provide him with the detailed
information that would allow him to examine its claims thoroughly. The
ethical investment movement needs more. 'People have taken a lot on trust,'
says Mr Adams. 'The crux is to have independently verifiable information.'
The company stresses that it is making improvements all the time. It has
hired the former head of Oxfam's fair trading division in Canada to help
develop its projects. It recently appointed non-executive directors. It is
about to enshrine its 'values' in its official company memorandum of
association.
Yet the company's critics have a broader concern. It is not that it may have
failed on any one of the individual claims made by Entine or other critics,
but that the company persistently appears to exaggerate its involvement in
worthy causes. 'They take every positive aspect and promote it to the
maximum extent,' says Mr Adams.
Body Shop also plays down any negative information. For example, when news
emerged this week that Entine's allegations included the claims that there
had been 'emissions' from its bottling and warehousing plant in New Jersey,
Mr Roddick said there were, in fact, two spills of 30 gallons of shampoo two
years ago, and the company notified the authorities immediately.
However, Hanover Sewage Authority, the local body charged with cleaning the
water and monitoring standards, says it traced three spills caused by Body
Shop in 1992-93, totalling at least 62 gallons. In each case, the authority
detected the leaks and told the Body Shop.
What also irritates critics is the company's reluctance to accept any
alternative point of view - and its eagerness to silence those who challenge
it. The Channel Four libel action last year was one example.
Much of the ethical investment community has appeared reluctant to criticise
Body Shop, partly because the Roddicks have long been involved with the
organisations set up to examine and promote ethical causes within the
business world and beyond.
'One of the problems is the desire of the ethical movement to seek
champions,' says Mr Adams. 'It was a role that Anita was eminently fitted
for. But you need a balance between champions and the development of
systems.'
Will the recent events make much difference to investors outside the narrow
confines of the ethical movement, or to Body Shop's customers and therefore
ultimately its financial performance?
Many observers say that adverse publicity about Body Shop's ethical
standards may not drive away large numbers of customers. The overriding
reason most shoppers buy Raspberry Ripple Bathing Bubbles and Camomile
Shampoo is because they like the products - not because of Body Shop's
environmental policies.
Ms Hilary Monk of Verdict, the retail research group, says customers in a
recent survey ranked Body Shop's product quality well above that of other
health and beauty retailers, and said it was their most important reason for
shopping there.
But Mr Nick Hawkins, retail analyst at Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank,
says customers are reassured by the feeling that the products they are
buying are environmentally friendly, and are prepared to pay more for them.
'Customers look through green-tinted spectacles at Body Shop's products.
Take away the green specs, and you might have to take a bit of the price
premium away,' he says.
Any tarnishing of Body Shop's environmental image would make it more
vulnerable to price competition. It would remove the group's main point of
differentiation from imitators such as the 'natural' and 'global'
collections launched by Boots in the UK, or Bath &amp; Body Works, the US
natural toiletries chain which is expanding into Britain.
When asked whether the company would be changing as a result of the
criticism, Angela Bawtree said simply: 'It is business as usual.' Yet for
ethical investors at least, Body Shop may never be seen in the same way
again.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Swans bidder may not proceed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The only prospective bidder for Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in
receivership, said yesterday it was reviewing whether it wished to proceed
with the acquisition, in view of the attitude of the Ministry of Defence.
French-based Soffia/Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie said it would make
a decision over the weekend.
Mr Fred Henderson, chairman of CMN Support Services in the UK, will fly to
France today for discussions with Mr Iskandar Safa, head of Soffia.
He said: 'I think there's a bias in favour of it not going ahead but that's
not a definite decision.
'We have to look at the overall deal and see if it still makes sense, and in
particular make our minds up whether we still have the same faith in the MoD
agreeing to Swan Hunter carrying out contracts for them in the future. That
is a serious doubt.'
Time for a going-concern sale of Swan Hunter is running out. Price
Waterhouse, the receiver, has set a deadline of Wednesday for CMN to start
paying the wages of the design team, which is crucial to winning new orders.
The MoD said last night that Mr Roger Freeman, defence procurement minister,
had issued an invitation to Mr Safa to meet him in London within the next
few days.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Bank mortgage lending figures show 9% fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More discouraging signs in the housing market came yesterday from bank
mortgage lending figures which showed a fall in new net lending and in loans
approved in July compared with June.
The British Bankers' Association, which released the figures, said they
reflected the relative reduction in banks' market share compared with last
summer.
But these figures, with those published by the Building Societies'
Association last week, show that the number of loans approved last month -
about 83,000 - was about 10,000 fewer than the number approved in June and
about 4,000 down from the previous July.
Lenders have been saying that although recovery has been slow and fragile by
comparison with last summer there has been some advance in lending. But Mr
John Ecklin, BBA director of statistics, acknowledged that the figures were
'disappointing'.
On a seasonally adjusted basis new net lending by banks in July totalled
Pounds 593m, a fall of 9 per cent compared with Pounds 652m in June, and
below the Pounds 910m lent last July. Net lending figures take into account
repayment of principal.
Gross lending by banks in July amounted to Pounds 1.8bn, but the BBA said
that the increase from the Pounds 1.7bn June figure was probably 'more than
accounted for' by seasonal factors.
July was the month of highest mortgage lending by banks and societies last
year.
Separately, Halifax Building Society's annual survey on home improvements
shows that homeowners are preferring to use their savings to pay for home
improvements instead of increasing their mortgages or taking out loans.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Herculean labour for the MoD: With Lockheed on bribery
charges, Malcolm Rifkind has some tough choices to make
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lockheed, the US aerospace company, has been embarrassed by the disclosure
that it faces charges of bribery in the US. The US State Department's
resulting restriction on the export of its Hercules transport aircraft may
make life uncomfortable.
The critical issue for the company in the next few months is the impact the
affair will have on its chances of selling a large number of its
next-generation Hercules to the Royal Air Force.
The bribery charges relate to a contract where Lockheed and two of its
executives are accused of paying an Egyptian politician Dollars 1m to help
secure an order for Hercules five years ago. Lockheed denies the charges.
But because the company has been indicted the US State Department has put a
stop on licences allowing Lockheed to export its Hercules C-130 and Orion
P-3 reconnaissance aircraft. The ban applies to export licences issued after
the charges were made on June 22 although the company can ask for exceptions
to be made on a case-by-case basis.
From a purely legal standpoint Lockheed should still be able to export the
next-generation Hercules to Britain. Negotiations with the government to
replace the first half of Britain's ageing Hercules transporter fleet have
been under way for many months.
The UK is still deciding whether to buy the new generation - the C-130J -
from Lockheed or to refurbish its Hercules fleet and wait for the new
European Future Large Aircraft to become available early in the next decade.
Lockheed has offered the Ministry of Defence a fixed-price deal which
includes 30 Hercules aircraft at about Pounds 25m each, and a package of
training and support bringing the total cost to about Pounds 900m. The
company has also obtained the export licences that it would need to sell the
aircraft.
The licences were granted before the June 22 deadline and are therefore
still valid. The company says that even if the licences had not already been
granted, it would have argued for waivers and might well have received the
go-ahead.
But Lockheed still faces an uncomfortable few months. The bribery case will
probably not come to trial before next year and the State Department's
restrictions will remain in force until then. If the company is cleared the
matter will rest there. If it is convicted the State Department can continue
an indefinite bar on exports until it is satisfied that the company has
reformed its practices.
The Ministry of Defence had intended to choose between Hercules and the
European aircraft before the end of the year but BAe has argued for more
time to present its case, as the feasibility study for the Future Large
Aircraft is not yet complete.
A cross-departmental Whitehall committee has recently been set up to examine
the industrial implications of buying from the US instead of Europe, as well
as the military needs of the RAF. That may also slow the decision.
In any case the defence ministry may be tempted to go slow while the
Lockheed case remains unresolved. Many MPs will object if the order
eventually goes to the US, and the case will be harder for Mr Malcolm
Rifkind, the defence secretary, to present if an overseas winner is also the
subject of a corruption charge.
The ministry says it has been aware of the problem for some time and does
not feel that the charges will affect the eventual decision.
Lockheed says it has done nothing wrong and its case for the RAF buying the
Hercules remains unaffected. BAe, perhaps unsurprisingly, is saying nothing
at all.
Nevertheless, the incident raises the political stakes for ministers. The
RAF has long favoured buying new Hercules, partly because some of the fleet
is wearing badly and the C-130J will be available much earlier than the
European aircraft, and partly because an order for the Hercules now would
mean 30 new aircraft while there is still money in the budget to pay for
them.
But if the defence secretary is tempted to back that view he will have to
take on the BAe industrial lobby. He would doubtless feel in a stronger
position to do so if Lockheed's name were cleared first.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Lib Dems plan NHS 'rationing'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrats are considering a system of healthcare 'rationing'
which would make non-essential cosmetic and fertility treatments difficult
or impossible to obtain on the National Health Service.
The idea is floated in a consultation paper to be published on Monday by the
party's health policy working group.
The paper says informal rationing is already operating in the health
service, mainly through long waiting lists for certain kinds of treatment,
but there is a case for 'rational priority setting' of the kind introduced
in some US states and New Zealand.
It suggests treatment priorities could be established through public
consultation after the costs and benefits had been clarified by medical
experts.
It does not say which conditions might cease to be covered, but the working
party is understood to have focused on areas such as tattoo removal and
advanced fertility treatments.
Priority setting would be accompanied by a shift of NHS resources into
preventive healthcare, combined with a health tax and 'transparent' NHS
accounting to show the annual costs of different forms of treatment.
Members of the working party believe this would increase public pressure for
a reduction in 'self-inflicted' illnesses such as those caused by smoking.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Aslef acts over rail strike safety
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rail dispute took a new turn yesterday with Aslef, the drivers' union,
informing its members that they have the right to refuse to take charge of
trains on signalling strike days.
Aslef has written to its 14,500 British Rail members telling them that they
are legally entitled not to drive a train if they have concerns about
safety.
The move follows advice from the union's solicitors after an alleged string
of complaints from drivers about the competence of staff working signal
boxes during strike action by members of the RMT union in its pay dispute
with Railtrack. Anger has been expressed by Aslef over BR's move to offer
Railtrack some of its staff to run signal boxes during strikes.
BR's rulebook obliges drivers not to move a train and to approach a
supervisor if they have serious concerns.
BR said the legal advice given to Aslef was absolutely correct. 'We would
not expect any staff to act in an unsafe manner,' it said.
Aslef said solicitors had advised the union that drivers who decided not to
run a train were protected under the 1993 Trade Union Reform and Employment
Rights Act.
The union said: 'We are told that the act gives employees the right not to
be dismissed, made redundant or subject to any detriment if they take
appropriate steps to protect themselves because they believe they are in
serious or imminent danger.'
Aslef's solicitors have told the union that the legislation was 'untried'
and there could be a test case involving an individual driver if action was
taken following the advice.
A mass walk-out of drivers during next week's action is unlikely. Drivers
who did walk out would risk laying themselves open to disciplinary action
for negligence if, for example, a train was stopped between stations.
In its letter to its members Aslef stresses: 'We will encourage our members
to act responsibly and adhere to these procedures but we cannot just carry
on warning about safety hazards, being ignored and waiting for the
inevitable accident to occur.'
The Health and Safety Executive said it had investigated about two-thirds of
complaints by Aslef members and had found nothing to jeopardise public
safety.
Railtrack said last night that it planned to run freight trains on the East
Coast line from London to Scotland for the first time during a signal
workers' strike. A 48-hour strike is scheduled to start at midday on
Tuesday.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Solid increase in small business start-ups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The continuing economic recovery is underlined by a solid rise in the rate
of small-business formation in the first half of the year, according to
Barclays Bank.
About 226,900 new businesses were formed over the period, up 10 per cent on
the first half of last year. For the first time since 1990 the level of
start-ups rose in all regions.
The rate of generation of new businesses suggests that the recovery may
avoid the breakneck pace of new-company generation in the late 1980s. That
proved unsustainable and was followed by sharp increases in the failure
rate.
The recovery in manufacturing start-ups was particularly strong, boosted by
strong export demand and the strength of the domestic recovery, Barclays
said. The retail sector accounted for a smaller share of start-ups than in
the first half of last year.
Small-business closures in the second quarter fell to 109,000, nearly 16 per
cent below the rate of the same period last year.
The north-west is leading the recovery in the small-business sector. More
than 33,000 new businesses were formed in the first six months, a rise of 20
per cent. In Wales there was a 13 per cent increase.
The south-east, with an 8 per cent increase in new business formation,
formed the most businesses but its rate of increase was below the national
average.
The south-west, where the economy has been among the hardest hit, is showing
signs of recovery for the first time since 1990. But its rate of formation
was just 6 per cent.

FT  27 AUG 94 / SNP to help with Tayside fuel bills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A council controlled by the Scottish National party intends to help elderly
and poor people pay their electricity bills by purchasing pre-payment
electricity stamps from Hydro-Electric at a discount.
The stamps will be sold at the discounted price through social-work offices
in Tayside region, where the SNP won control from Labour in May.
The SNP says the scheme will mitigate the increase in fuel bills caused by
the imposition of value added tax.
Hydro-Electric said it sold the stamps at a 3 per cent discount to shops for
resale and had also sold them to the charity Age Concern. It said, however,
that it had only had preliminary talks with Tayside.
The SNP says the only cost to council taxpayers will be that of
administering the scheme. It hopes to arrange a similar one with British
Gas.
The prospect of industrial action by electricity workers receded yesterday
after National Grid, the transmission system for the power industry in
England and Wales, made an improved pay offer worth 2.95 per cent plus a
one-off payment of between Pounds 450 and Pounds 650. Unions are likely to
accept the deal. b

FT  27 AUG 94 / Broadcasters' political 'dependency' attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Broadcasting organisations are becoming too dependent on the government and
their ability to call politicians to account is being dangerously eroded, Mr
Greg Dyke, former chief executive of London Weekend Television, said last
night.
The broadcasting legislation passed by the Thatcher government was still
having its effect, he said. 'Although the threats to the political freedom
of broadcasters today are less obvious, they are there and, more seriously,
have been institutionalised.'
Mr Dyke was giving the James MacTaggart memorial lecture, which
traditionally opens the Edinburgh international television festival.
Mr Dyke said he had two main concerns. The first was that in commercial
broadcasting the delicate balance of being both a business and a broadcaster
was in danger of being too dominated by business.
Secondly, and more importantly, he feared the relationship between
broadcasters and government was becoming a dependent one, 'with broadcasters
constantly wanting favours and legislative action from government - a
position which is largely of government's making, and as a result gives
government far too much power in the relationship'.
Mr Dyke said that partly because of the inadequacies of the 1990
Broadcasting Act and partly because of the business ambitions of some of the
ITV companies, the larger ITV groups were always wanting something from
government - such as changes in ownership rules or reductions in the amount
they paid the government for their licences.
'This, I would suggest, is a potential threat to a politically free
broadcasting system and potentially gives enormous power to the government
of the day,' he said.
Mr Dyke, who has made it clear that he is a Labour supporter, suggested that
any future Labour government should immediately set up a government
commission to look at broadcasting.
He said possible reforms included new ways of appointing the chairman and
governors of the BBC and the chairman and members of the Independent
Television Commission and a guaranteed income for the BBC over the 10 years
of its royal charter.
He also suggested that, to avoid the growing tension between some sorts of
journalism and the business interests of commercial broadcasters, two boards
should be considered for broadcasting organisations, one business and one
broadcasting.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Plans for third Forth bridge divide Scots: A new road link
seems inevitable in spite of fears about congestion in Edinburgh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The two bridges spanning the Firth of Forth - the railway bridge, opened in
1890, and the road bridge, opened in 1964 - are likely to be joined in a few
years by a second road crossing.
It is a prospect that pleases people on the north side of the estuary in
Fife, but arouses foreboding on the south side, especially in Edinburgh, 10
miles to the east, where they fear that it will choke the city with extra
traffic.
The new bridge would stand just up-river from the existing link. Four
consortia of UK and Continental construction companies and banks have
registered their interest in building it as a privately funded project
financed by tolls. Including its associated roads, it would cost about
Pounds 400m and be Britain's biggest privately funded infrastructure project
after the Channel tunnel.
Traffic on the Forth road bridge has been growing by 4.5 per cent a year in
the past decade. Last year it carried an average of 49,800 vehicles a day
and exceeded its designed capacity of 60,000 a day on 15 days.
Consultants for the Scottish Office said last month that without a second
road bridge - and with minimal other traffic improvements - the expected
increase in daily traffic flows of about half by the year 2010 would cause
peak-time tailbacks of five to eight miles, north of the existing bridge.
The consultants looked at several options for improving the Forth crossing,
including not only a new bridge but also more investment in the railway
system in Fife and enhanced bus and rail services on the Lothian side. They
concluded that congestion would only be relieved by schemes including a new
bridge.
Scottish Office ministers are waiting for a final roads study and the
outcome of consultations before announcing their intentions, probably in
November. The choice of a new bridge, coupled with investment in better
public transport, seems inevitable.
Mr Alastair Darling, Labour MP for Edinburgh Central, said the bridge was 'a
solution to a political problem rather than solving a traffic or
environmental problem'. The government wanted 'a flagship project for its
private-finance initiative, which is faltering'.
He said that since 60 per cent of traffic going south across the bridge was
travelling to Edinburgh, with a quarter of that going to the city centre, a
new bridge would only encourage more people to drive there.
Mr Darling supports a grouping of environmental organisations called the
Forthright Alliance, which opposes a new bridge and wants a small number of
road improvements and a large investment in public transport, including a
rapid transport system in Edinburgh.
Mr David Begg, an Edinburgh University transport economist who chairs
Lothian region's transportation committee, believes rail traffic across the
Forth could be increased substantially by further investment in trains,
stations and new signalling in Edinburgh. The government is allowing Fife
region to borrow Pounds 9m to spend on station improvements, but Mr Begg
said this was not enough.
These arguments are rejected by Forth Connect, a consortium formed this
month to press for a second road bridge. It is backed by chambers of
commerce including those from Fife, Dundee and Aberdeen, but also Edinburgh,
and has support from Scottish Enterprise, the official development body, and
the CBI in Scotland.
Mr David Waring, director of strategy with Fife Enterprise, said improved
public transport around the Forth was desirable but would never remove the
need for a second bridge. He quoted a study for the Scottish Office which
showed that 70 per cent of people travelling from Fife to central Edinburgh
already used trains or buses.
Even if opponents become resigned to the new bridge, one aspect of the
project is certain to be unpopular. Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said
last year that higher tolls would probably be charged on the existing bridge
to help fund construction of the new one. He envisaged tolls of at least
Pounds 1.25 instead of the present 40p.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, yesterday described his meeting in
Belfast with an influential Irish-American delegation as 'an important step
forward' in the Northern Ireland peace process.
He and other Sinn Fein leaders spent three hours with Mr Bruce Morrison, a
former US congressman, and five other prominent Irish-Americans, who
received a detailed briefing on the peace process from the Irish prime
minister and foreign minister on Thursday.
Although on a private visit, the US delegation will report back to the White
House when it returns to the US next week.
After yesterday's meeting Mr Adams said: 'We can look forward to the peace
process moving on as a result of these discussions and deliberations.' Sinn
Fein believes the Irish-American lobby in the US will have a key role to
play in the months ahead, especially in the context of a widely expected
imminent IRA ceasefire.
The British and Irish governments have emphasised that Sinn Fein will be
admitted to round-table political talks only in the event of a permanent end
to IRA violence. But politicians on both sides of the border acknowledge
that an extended IRA ceasefire will put them under pressure to respond
positively, if there is to be any chance of a temporary ceasefire being
turned into a permanent one.
That is why Sinn Fein sees the powerful Irish-American lobby in the US as
having a role in helping to shape US government policy on Ireland, and in
turn influencing development of the peace process.
Mr Morrison said that he had been 'very encouraged' by yesterday's meeting
with the Sinn Fein leadership and that he believed the peace process was
moving 'in a very positive direction'.
Mr Morrison's delegation is to meet leaders from the Social Democratic and
Labour party (SDLP) and the Alliance party, but has been snubbed by the two
main unionist parties, the UUP and the DUP.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Labour calls for banks inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party yesterday called for the banking ombudsman to be made
responsible for investigating charges levied by banks.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, and Mr Alastair Darling, Labour's City
spokesman, also called yesterday for the Office of Fair Trading to
investigate banks' market shares in lending and providing other services to
small businesses.
The call for increased oversight of bank charges came after the six largest
UK banks reported a 69 per cent rise in first-half profits. Labour said
charges had risen sharply since the recession and loan margins remained
high.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Levitt trial legal aid bill tops Pounds 2m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The trial of Mr Roger Levitt, the financier who received a 180-hour
community service sentence for fraudulent trading, will cost the taxpayer
more than Pounds 2m in legal aid, it emerged yesterday.
The case followed the collapse of Mr Levitt's financial services group with
debts of more than Pounds 34m.
Mr John Marshall, MP for Hendon South, said he had obtained from the
solicitor-general's office figures showing that the final legal aid bill
amounted to Pounds 2,127,833.02 - Pounds 666,234.97 in counsel fees and
solicitor's costs of Pounds 1,461,598.05, In addition an extra award from
central funds of Pounds 10,699.17 was made to one defendant.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Welsh Water joins race to build private roads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Welsh Water has joined UK and Continental construction companies which have
formed rival joint ventures and consortia to bid for Pounds 380m of
privately financed road schemes announced last week by Mr John Watts, roads
minister.
At least eight potential groupings have emerged which expect to bid for one
or more of the four design, build, finance and operate contracts.
Contractors will be paid by shadow tolls from the Exchequer, based on the
number of vehicles using the road. In return they will design, finance,
construct and maintain the roads for 15 to 25 years.
Five of the the eight groupings are understood to include:
Tarmac and John Laing, the UK contractors, with Welsh Water and Transroute,
the largest French toll road operator. BZW are merchant bank advisers.
Amec and Alfred McAlpine, the UK construction companies, and Spanish
contractor Dragados.
Taylor Woodrow, Sir Robert McAlpine and Amey, all from the UK.
Mowlem of the UK and Dumez GTM of France, advised by Schroders merchant
bank.
Wimpey, the UK contractor, and Babtie Group, the UK highways design and
transport consultants. Merchant bank advisers are Morgan Grenfell.
Three other UK contractors - Costain, advised by NatWest Markets, Balfour
Beatty advised by Bank of America, and Trafalgar House - are separately
talking to potential partners and plan to bid.
It will be the first time that shadow tolls have been used since the
government removed its opposition to the concept in last year's Budget.
The schemes have attracted strong interest from Continental toll road and
construction companies anxious to break into what they believe will be a
growing market for privately financed infrastructure projects in the UK.
Welsh Water, which recently acquired Acer engineering consultants, also
wants to expand its UK and international business in large-scale
infrastructure schemes.
The four road projects are:
A Pounds 190m scheme to build a 19-mile link joining the M1 and M62 south of
Leeds with the A1. All three existing roads will be widened to dual
four-lane capacity on approaches to the new link road.
A Pounds 145m scheme to widen 13 miles of the A1 to motorway standard
between Alconbury, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough.
A Pounds 35m scheme to widen a 34-mile stretch of the A419 and A417 between
Swindon and Gloucester, including two bypasses.
A Pounds 10m project to bypass Haltwhistle, Northumberland, on the A69 plus
management of the entire 53-mile length of the A69 between Newcastle upon
Tyne and Carlisle.

FT  27 AUG 94 / How to barter a massage for didgeridoo expertise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Feel the need for a shiatsu massage? That will cost you 15 beaks. Want your
flat redecorated? Prepare to shell out 80 beaks, plus materials. How about a
didgeridoo lesson? A bargain at 10 beaks.
If you are wondering about the exchange rates for the exotic country where
'beaks' are legal tender, look no further than Kingston upon Thames in south
London.
About 120 residents participate in a Local Exchange and Trading System - or
Lets - a community bartering scheme in which members trade services and
goods such as gardening, babysitting and even midwifery using credit units.
These beaks were named after the local Beacon environmental centre.
This week Hounslow council in west London appointed the first full-time
development officer with a Pounds 30,000 budget to help start a Lets.
Hounslow's scheme will join 200 others around the UK where between 15 and
400 residents have banded together to form alternative economies,
particularly in financially disadvantaged areas.
The first Lets was set up in Norwich in 1985. In 1990 Letslink, the national
co-ordinator of local bartering schemes, was set up by Lets members in
Wiltshire and Stroud, Gloucestershire.
To start up a Lets a group of people produce a directory of services
offered. Each item is priced according to the local unit. In some schemes
the unit is linked to an hourly standard. The beak, for example, is worth 10
minutes of labour.
Members of the schemes are given cheque books and a central record keeper
debits or credits their accounts after each transaction. Ms Liz Shepard,
director of Letslink, said: 'There is no interest payable and no payment
schedule so you can start at zero and go into debit immediately. All that is
required is that everyone in the system has to provide services or goods.'
An increasing number of professional services are offered and several
businesses accept the barter units for at least some goods.
As well as providing economic benefits for those who would otherwise be
unable to afford organic vege-tables, massages or childminding, the schemes
are said to create community benefits.
Ms Beth Wells, co-ordinator of the West Wiltshire Lets, in which she will
mow lawns and provide astrological services, said: 'The community spirit is
quite incredible. It builds up a sense of trust and sharing.'
Defaulting on debt is not generally a problem and debt creation is
encouraged. Ms Anne-Marie Mayer, a co-ordinator of the Kingston scheme,
said: 'It is actually people with large credits and no debits who let the
system down. If people do a lot of work for other people but cannot think of
anything they want, it creates a lot of people with large negative balances
who then become disinclined to trade.'
Most Lets are conducted on a small enough scale to avoid taxes, although
businesses and those generating enough income to exceed personal limits are
expected to pay taxes.
The Inland Revenue, while supporting the bartering schemes, does not want to
get paid in beaks, however. It said: 'We want our taxes in sterling. Please
do not offer to wash all the windows at Somerset House.'

FT  27 AUG 94 / 'Great public schools' still dominant at A-level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 'great public schools' identified by the Clarendon Commission 130 years
ago dominate the rankings of independent schools' A-level results analysed
by the Financial Times today.
All the top four - Westminster, followed by Eton College, St Paul's and
Winchester College - were named by the Clarendon report, which aimed to
identify the best boys' schools in Victorian England. The lowest ranked of
the nine Clarendon schools in today's table is Rugby, which, at 65th, still
had results significantly better than the average for the independent
sector.
The results, based on figures supplied by the Independent Schools
Information Service (Isis), suggest that parents looking for the best chance
of strong academic performance need to pay for the privilege, with all the
top four schools last year charging significantly more than the average.
There were exceptions, however. Manchester Grammar, which was ranked seventh
this year, charged more than Pounds 1,000 less than the average day fees for
the country as a whole.
Girls' schools tended to be significantly cheaper than boys' schools.
Several girls' schools also celebrated sharp improvements in their league
positions.
Mrs Ann Longley, headmistress of Roedean School, near Brighton in East
Sussex, which ranked 27th, said: 'This is a confirmation of the success of
girls' single-sex education.'
Malvern Girls' College, which attracted national publicity two years ago
when low payment of fees led it to employ debt-collectors, rose to 13th. It
believed that the impact of the recession was receding and that parents were
showing more interest in girls' boarding schools following the publication
of league tables.
The sharp decline in the popularity of boarding over the past few years,
which saw the number of boarders fall by 5.5 per cent in 1993-94 following a
6.5 per cent fall the previous year, left the most prestigious schools
untouched.
Some well-known boarding schools recorded weaker results, however, with
Blundell's in Devon finishing 423rd in the FT's analysis while Wrekin
College in Shropshire came 442nd.
Overall the figures show an improvement of 3.1 per cent in the grade
achieved since last year - slightly ahead of the trend for schools in
England and Wales as a whole.
Of the A-levels entered at Isis schools, 29.4 per cent resulted in A grades
and 22.6 per cent in B grades. Only 6.7 per cent resulted in failures.
Using the points system adopted by university admissions tutors, where an A
is given 10 points and an E two, the average score for each candidate was
20.31 - up from 19.69 last year and equivalent to marks slightly better than
one B and two Cs.
There were wide regional variations. Greater Manchester schools had the
strongest overall A-level performance, with an average of 21.5 A-level
points per pupil. Greater London was not far behind on 21. North Wales had
the weakest A-level points score on the British mainland, with 16 A-level
points per pupil.
The Department for Education plans to publish its third annual performance
tables for GCSE and A-level results for all British schools in November.
Figures for independent schools' performance at GCSE this year will be
available from Isis at the end of next week.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Sunday shop opening becomes legal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All shops in England and Wales will be able to open legally tomorrow for the
first time - but this is unlikely to lead to a shopping free-for-all.
The Sunday Trading Act became law yesterday, permitting all shops smaller
than 3,000 sq ft to open freely on Sundays, and larger shops to open for up
to six hours. It replaced the Shops Act 1950, which placed tight
restrictions on Sunday opening. Sunday trading has long been deregulated in
Scotland.
The move is not expected to lead to a large increase in the number of stores
opening. Many small businesses have been opening in defiance of the act for
years while larger chains have increasingly flouted the law in recent years,
saying that it was outmoded.
The biggest first-time opener will be Marks and Spencer, which has
consistently refused to open on Sundays outside Scotland, and campaigned for
the law to allow Sunday opening only in the four weeks before Christmas.
Twenty of its stores will open on Sundays from tomorrow, 17 of them in
out-of-town locations.
John Lewis Partnership, which also refused to open in the past, has decided
that its first Sunday opening should not be on a bank holiday weekend.
Eighteen of the group's 108 Waitrose supermarkets will open on Sundays from
next week, with the rest likely to open during the pre-Christmas period.
John Lewis department stores will remain closed.
Some retailers fear the extra expense of opening on Sundays and paying staff
premium rates will not be recouped by sales. The St David's shopping centre
in Cardiff decided against Sunday opening after a poll found most shops
opposed it.
But the largest centres - Lakeside in Essex, MetroCentre in Tyne and Wear,
and Meadowhall near Sheffield - will all open.
The group Keep Sunday Special, which campaigned to limit Sunday opening,
said the change would 'further erode both family and community life'.
The Consumers Association said that the change did not go far enough.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Japanese consumer prices decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Consumer prices in Japan fell last month for the first time since March
1987, but few expect the trend to continue. The 0.2 per cent year-on-year
drop, announced yesterday by the government's Management and Co-ordination
Agency, compares with a 0.6 per cent rise in June. The decrease largely
reflects cheaper vegetable prices; this season's harvest brought prices down
again after last year's heavy rain led to crop failures.
However, July prices were also down by a seasonally adjusted 0.5 per cent
from this June, supplying evidence that manufacturers of consumer durables
have been cutting prices in an attempt to stimulate demand.
This shone through more strongly in the agency's preliminary estimate of
prices prevailing in Tokyo for August. The index for the capital fell 0.2
per cent compared with the same month of 1993. Household electrical products
were down 2.6 per cent and clothing and textile goods 3.6 per cent.
Car production fell 10.6 per cent last month from a year earlier, the Japan
Automobile Manufacturers' Association said yesterday. However, some makers
such as Mazda stepped up output in anticipation of demand for new models.
Industry officials suggest August sales will turn in their best performance
for four years.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Support grows for fishing treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
There is 'overwhelming' support among governments for a binding
international treaty to preserve the world's fish stocks, the chairman of a
United Nations conference said yesterday.
But the failure of the two-week meeting to reach consensus was sharply
criticised by environmentalists. Greenpeace called draft proposals generated
by the meeting 'too little too late'.
The conference comes after a year of fierce international clashes over
disputed fishing rights and fishing methods in nearly every ocean. Improved
technology helped the annual catch of fish to rise fivefold between 1950 and
1989 to 91m tonnes, UN figures indicate. But countries worldwide report that
catch sizes now appear to be falling because of depleted stocks.
The draft text issued yesterday from the conference on 'straddling and
highly migratory fish stocks' asks countries 'to conserve and sustainably
manage fish stocks'. It recommends creation of regional organisations to set
limits on the size of national catches, and a compulsory arbitration
procedure to resolve disputes.
Most conflicts have flared over fish that travel through the high seas
rather than national waters. Migratory fish such as tuna travel thousands of
kilometres, while 'straddling' fish, such as cod, herring and some squid,
travel back and forth from coastal waters into international zones.
Controversy at the meeting has centred on compliance and enforcement, with
Japan, North Korea and Russia expressing most unease. But Mr Satya Nandan,
Fiji ambassador to the UN and conference chairman, said the required backing
of two-thirds of delegates 'is achievable' as 'the overwhelming majority
want a binding solution'.
UN officials said although the meeting had not reached consensus,
considerable progress had been made since the last session in March, when
governments had clashed over much of the draft text. Delegates were hopeful
yesterday that the next session in March could agree on a binding treaty.

FT  27 AUG 94 / US joins the hunt for Chinese market share: Tony Walker
analyses a business initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, arrives in Beijing today he will
be the highest-level Clinton admin-istration official to visit China since
renewal in May of China's Most Favoured Nation trading access in the US.
But perhaps more important than the status and timing of his visit is the
fact that Mr Brown will be following the example of others, such as the
Europeans, in seeking to link surging official commercial ties with US
corporate aspirations.
Mr Brown will be accompanied by the heads of no fewer than 24 leading US
corporations in the fields of energy, finance, industry and information
systems. These include Mr Robert Denham, chairman and CEO of the US
securities house Salomon, Mr Michael Jordan, chairman of Westinghouse
Electric, and Mr Robert Eaton, chairman of Chrysler, the car manufacturer.
On the government side the Brown party includes the director of the US
Export-Import Bank, senior trade officials and the US executive director of
the Asian Development Bank.
Mr Brown could not be accused of selling his mission short. He described it
as 'historic' and predicted it would initiate a 'new era in US-China
relations'.
'Active US engagement recognises both the importance of the world's
fastest-growing economy to US economic growth and the importance of
advancing our interests with the Chinese government and its people,' he said
on the eve of his arrival.
There is no doubt that the recent renewal of MFN, particularly the
'de-linking' of human rights and trade issues, has opened the way for a more
settled commercial relationship; even though Washington and Beijing are at
loggerheads on such questions as Chinese intellectual property rights abuses
and terms for China's entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Human rights issues also continue to be problematical. Mr Brown has said he
will raise the question 'in the appropriate way in the appropriate forum'.
This hardly suggests that human rights will be a centre-piece of his visit.
While American business was dismayed by what it regarded as the
administration's initial bumbling approach to relations with China - MFN
renewal threatened to become a debacle - it now appears satisfied that Mr
Clinton and his advisers are committed to establishing a framework that
would facilitate a broader and more productive relationship.
Mr Robert Kapp, president of the US-China Business Council, whose membership
has grown strongly in the past year, said in Beijing this week that the
value of the Brown visit lay in the emphasis it would give to the
'multi-dimensional' aspect of the relationship.
Plans to 're-invigorate' the US-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade
with the establishment of working groups in six key areas of mutual business
interest, such as services and information technology, were a step in the
right direct.
The joint commission began meeting again in April this year when Ms Wu Yi,
China's trade minister, visited Washington. Sessions were suspended after
Chinese troops shot pro-democracy protesters in and around Beijing's central
Tiananmen square in 1989.
Like the visit to China last year of Mr Helmut Kohl, the Germany chancellor,
whose accompanying businessmen signed contracts worth billions of dollars,
Mr Brown's party is expected to initial a wad of agreements.
From China's perspective, Mr Brown is a welcome guest. Mr Shi Jianxin, a
senior Trade Ministry official, told the official Xinhua news agency that
the visit 'reflects the US government's willingness to adopt a more active
and practical attitude toward its relations with China.' Mr Shi described
prospects for further co-operation as broad.
But while Mr Brown will spend much of the time during his few days in
Beijing in the warm embrace of Chinese hospitality, including meetings with
the country's leaders, he will also be obliged to address contentious issues
such as terms for China's Gatt entry.
The US and China are still relatively far apart on questions like 'national
treatment'; that is the obligation of Gatt contracting parties to accord
each other corresponding market access privileges. Gatt talks are scheduled
to resume in Geneva next month and China is pressing hard to fulfil
requirements for access to enable it to become a founder member of the World
Trade Organisation.
Commerce Department officials say Mr Brown does not plan to make too much in
discussions with Chinese officials of a growing Sino-US trade imbalance, but
there is no doubt the issue looms in the background.
China last year exported goods to the US worth Dollars 31.5bn (Pounds
20.3bn) compared with imports of Dollars 8.7bn, leaving a trade gap of
Dollars 22.8bn. In the six months to June, China had opened up a gap over
the US of Dollars 11.6bn, suggesting the balance of trade in China's favour
will be much the same this year.
Not least of Mr Brown's objectives on this mission will be to seek ways to
stimulate US exports to counter the persistent and growing trade deficits.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Fall in Japanese consumer prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Consumer prices in Japan fell last month for the first time since March
1987, but few expect the trend to continue. The 0.2 per cent year-on-year
drop, announced yesterday by the government's Management and Co-ordination
Agency, compares with a 0.6 per cent rise in June. The decrease largely
reflects cheaper vegetable prices; this season's harvest brought prices down
again after last year's heavy rain led to crop failures.
However, July prices were also down by a seasonally adjusted 0.5 per cent
from this June, supplying evidence that manufacturers of consumer durables
have been cutting prices in an attempt to stimulate demand.
This shone through more strongly in the agency's preliminary estimate of
prices prevailing in Tokyo for August. The index for the capital fell 0.2
per cent compared with the same month of 1993. Household electrical products
were down 2.6 per cent and clothing and textile goods 3.6 per cent.
Tokyo prices would have fallen further this month were it not, perversely,
for a rise in the retail cost of fresh fruit brought about by this summer's
heatwave. The sun, combined with water shortages, has affected some crops.
Month-on-month, consumer prices in the capital were up 0.4 per cent from
July.
Excluding fresh produce, prices were up by a year-on-year 0.7 per cent in
the capital this month and 0.8 per cent nationwide in July. But these
figures were inflated by an increase in utility charges, and analysts are
not expecting a strong movement in inflation for the autumn - as the economy
goes through what still appears likely to be a patchy revival.
Car production fell 10.6 per cent last month from a year earlier, the Japan
Automobile Manufacturers Association said yesterday. Some makers such as
Mazda stepped up output in anticipation of demand for newly launched models.
Industry officials are suggesting that August vehicle sales will turn in
their best performance for four years.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Australia treads wary line in logging row with Malaysia:
Kieran Cooke and Nikki Tait on a spat in the south Pacific
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE and NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like sparks in bush grass, a row is once again smouldering between Malaysia
and Australia.
Late last year Malaysia reacted angrily when Mr Paul Keating, Australia's
prime minister, called Dr Mahathir Mohamad, his Malaysian counterpart, a
recalcitrant for his non-attendance at the Seattle meeting of Asia-Pacific
regional leaders. At one stage Australian trade and contracts in Malaysia
were under threat. The argument was settled only after some delicate
diplomacy.
Now a fresh row threatens to erupt over the activities of Malaysian logging
companies in the south Pacific.
At a meeting of south Pacific leaders in Australia earlier this month, Mr
Keating accused Malaysian, South Korean and Indonesian logging companies of
'ripping off' the island nations by paying too little for valuable timber
products.
'Unless the environmental piracy of foreign companies operating in the south
Pacific region is controlled, the future for the region will be bleak,' Mr
Keating said.
Malaysia, which has shown itself deeply sensitive to outside criticism,
particularly on environmental issues, accused Australia of interfering in
matters outside its control. 'What is the business of Australia to criticise
the presence of Malaysian or other foreign logging companies in the south
Pacific islands?' asked Mr Lim Keng Yaik, Malaysia's minister of primary
industries.
Mr Lim suggested that Australia was jealous of the success of Malaysian
companies in the region and was using half truths to 'jumble up
environmental facts'.
This week Dr Mahathir added his voice to the anti-Australian chorus. In a
thinly veiled attack on Australian policy, he questioned the motives behind
a ADollars 2m (Pounds 960,000) aid package for the Solomon Islands. This was
announced during the south Pacific forum, and was offered on condition that
the Solomon Islands' government banned logging activity on certain
government land. The logging was being conducted by Kumpulan Emas, the
Malaysian group.
Australia said the money was to prevent environmental piracy but Dr Mahathir
questioned whether the aid had anything to do with ecology.
'Unfortunately the activities of Asean (Association of South-East Asia
Nations) loggers to help the economy of many developing countries have
aroused resentment among some regional powers,' Dr Mahathir said. 'Suddenly
money is offered to these developing countries to persuade them to stop
Malaysian investors and investors from other countries.'
Malaysian logging companies, most of them tightly controlled family
businesses owned by Chinese Malaysians, have accumulated vast financial
resources from the timber trade. The east Malaysia state of Sarawak alone
accounts for 80 per cent of the world's unprocessed tropical timber exports.
But with environmental pressures forcing cutbacks on logging, the country's
timber conglomerates have been looking at opportunities elsewhere.
In Papua New Guinea one Malaysian company, the privately held Rimbunan Hijau
group, has logging concessions of nearly 2m hectares - an area more than 20
times the size of Singapore.
Indonesia's powerful timber companies have also recently begun teaming up
with Malaysian loggers to launch operations in PNG.
Government and environmental groups in PNG say the foreign timber companies
have accumulated too much power and are resisting official controls on the
industry, pointing to the fact that Malaysian companies now control more
than 60 per cent of PNG's log exports.
In the Solomon Islands, a Malaysian company - Silvania Products, owned by
Kumpulan Emas - had its logging licence suspended recently for breaching
environmental regulations. Last month a senior executive of one of
Malaysia's biggest conglomerates resigned after being accused of trying to
bribe a Solomon Islands minister in connection with a timber deal - a charge
the executive denies.
Australia, as so often in its relations with South-East Asia, is in a bind.
Mr Keating clearly feels he is justified in criticising the activities of
Malaysian and other companies, and there is strong pressure from the local
environmental lobby for him to take a more forceful line. Australia is a big
aid donor and significant trading partner with the South Pacific nations,
and hence has some influence.
But the country's trade policy is now so heavily committed to the
Asia-Pacific region that it has to tread carefully to ensure that export and
investment opportunities are not put at risk.
In Brisbane, Mr Keating was scrupulous about not criticising Malaysian
loggers in isolation and always mentioned Korean and Indonesian companies in
the same breath. 'Whoever these companies belong to, I think that they
should be encouraged to be good corporate citizens,' he said.
After the 'recalcitrant' row, Australian ministers have taken a low-key line
where Malaysia is concerned. For example, Australia and New Zealand, through
their joint Closer Economic Relations deal, are keen to join the Asean
Free-Trade Area (AFTA). When, earlier this year, Malaysia's foreign minister
suggested that new members or linkages would not be possible for at least a
decade, his Australian counterpart said soothingly that he believed Asean
ministers would see the benefits of bringing the two groups together. No
one, he added, underestimated the difficulties involved.
But whether Australia's careful approach will defuse the tension is
questionable. Dr Mahathir has expounded the idea of Malaysia Inc: that
government and business work as a team in furthering the nation's
development. As Mr Keating is learning, it also means that criticism of
Malaysian companies is criticism of the Malaysian government and Dr
Mahathir.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Thais plan drive against traffic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM BARNES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Thai government plans to force drivers to leave their cars on the
outskirts of Bangkok, as the number of vehicles joining the traffic jams in
the capital grows by 500 a day.
The government had been hoping that three new elevated or underground urban
railway projects would relieve the traffic crisis, which is costing the
country millions of dollars. But it is clear that none of these alternative
systems will be operating this century.
The aim of the traffic scheme, says Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, would be
to force commuters to leave their vehicles in one of two dozen special car
parks on the edge of the city and take an improved bus service into the
business and government district. However, finding a way to keep some
drivers out while others are allowed in could prove difficult.
One scheme the government is considering would only allow cars into the city
when they were carrying two or more passengers. But a similar scheme
introduced in Indonesia, where cars needed to carry four people to enter the
city, saw a new industry take off as boys began hiring themselves out as
passengers on the city outskirts.
In Singapore, a scheme which allowed cars with number plates that ended with
an even number and those ending with an odd number to enter the city on
alternate days led to a rise in car sales as people made sure they had the
appropriate plates.
Thailand may try to get around these problems by making private car owners
purchase special stickers to enter Bangkok.
But many doubt the government will find a way to force Bangkok's burgeoning
middle class to abandon the airconditioned safety of cars for the dubious
comforts of a Thai bus.
'It'll never, ever happen. It's impractical,' says Mr Neil Semple, a
research manager at brokers HG Asia.
The government's transport planner argues the scheme will work as 'everyone
agrees the current situation cannot go on. Maybe the super-rich will still
take their cars - but they will be made to pay for the pleasure'.
Mr Khunying Chodchoy Sophonpanich, who has led the campaign for an
underground railway system, believes Thais use their cars far too much.
'This is the only was to ensure that there are fewer cars on the streets.'
Meanwhile, the prime minister has vowed the government will press ahead with
the rail projects, but bureaucratic infighting, technical and environmental
problems and political opposition continue to block progress.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Growth in GDP allays US concerns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US economy grew slightly more rapidly than originally estimated in the
second quarter of this year, but not as fast as some analysts had feared,
writes James Harding.
The US Commerce Department announced an upward revision of the growth in
second-quarter real gross domestic product - the output of goods and
services in the US - to 3.8 per cent from its initial estimate of 3.7 per
cent. The increase in GDP between April and June, measured at seasonally
adjusted annualised rates, follows a 3.3 per cent rise in the first quarter
of 1994 and a 6.3 per cent increase in last year's final period.
Analysts had expected an upward revision to as much as 4.2 per cent, which
would have raised concerns that the economy was growing too rapidly.
Financial markets yesterday appeared to interpret the moderate increase on
the original estimate as a sign that the Federal Reserve's pre-emptive
tightening of monetary policy to head off inflation was having the desired
effect.
The government also reported that after-tax profits of US corporations rose
7.4 per cent in the second quarter in a sharp reversal of the 3.5 per cent
drop in the first period.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Thunder and lightning yesterday achieved what President Bill Clinton could
not - halt the tide of Cubans attempting to flee the island by boat.
Bad weather in the Straits of Florida forced the first substantial drop in
the number of refugees since the US administration announced it would no
longer allow Cubans entry to the US and would take them for detention at the
US naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
The Coast Guard reported 1,670 people were picked up on Thursday but only
378 people were picked up between midnight Thursday and mid-afternoon
yesterday. In the five days before Thursday, more than 2,500 people had been
found daily.
As rain and high seas continued through yesterday, concerns grew over the
numbers of people who may have died in the tropical thunder-storm.
In South Florida, callers to local radio stations said they had seen small
boats and rafts washed ashore with no apparent survivors.
The Coast Guard acknowledged that there had been some fatalities, but said
that there was no way of keeping track of the numbers lost at sea. One
official went on to say that bad weather was making the rescue operation
more difficult.
'Even on a calm day it is difficult to pick people up off unstable rafts -
in rough weather it is more dangerous,' the official said. Finding people
was an increasing problem: 'It is much more difficult to spot rafters
because they're not visible due to the high waves, fog and rain.'
In Washington, President Clinton yesterday met his foreign policy advisers
to discuss ways of preventing people from trying to flee the island and
measures to tighten the trade embargo against Cuba. Mr Warren Christopher,
US secretary of state, broke off his holiday in Florida to attend the White
House session on the Cuba problem.
Defence officials expected to move between 7,000 and 9,000 extra soldiers to
the Guantanamo base to help the 3,000 already there building the refugee
camps. Mr Dennis Boxx, the Pentagon spokesman, estimated it would cost
Dollars 100m (Pounds 65m) to set up expanded camps for the Cubans assuming
the numbers do not exceed 45,000.
The Pentagon predicts it will cost about Dollars 20m a month to run the
camps.
Meanwhile, a Florida boat owner was detained by the Coast Guard for
allegedly trying to smuggle nine Cubans across the 90-mile stretch between
Cuba and Florida.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Brazilians turn blind eye to budget: Presidential candidates
ignore fiscal forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil has never been renowned for sticking to budgets, which partly
explains the country's inflation problems. So, when President Itamar Franco
announced recently that all the candidates for October's presidential
elections would be called to a special preview of next year's budget,
economists began to wonder if the years of fiscal indiscipline were over.
The idea, according to Mr Franco, was to show candidates the government's
cash shortage and stress that the incoming president must keep control of
spending to add credibility to the country's new currency, the Real.
Unfortunately, when the meeting went ahead yesterday, none of the candidates
turned up. Instead they sent lowly campaign officials who mumbled apologies
about their bosses being 'very busy' electioneering. After all, elections in
Brazil involve spending money to win votes, not worrying about where it
comes from.
The episode does not mean candidates do not care about the economy. The
Real, launched in July, has brought monthly inflation down from 50 per cent
to less than 5 per cent and has a good chance of keeping it there. This has
helped poorer voters, who have switched support to Mr Fernando Henrique
Cardoso, the former economy minister, who oversaw the Real's introduction.
What it does show, however, is Brazil's traditional disregard for budgets or
spending promises. Brazilians are amazed by the pomp, and credibility, which
surrounds budgets in other countries. This is partly for historical reasons;
under the military governments of 1964-85, budgets were often works of
fiction which concealed investments in secret or strategic projects.
Since the return to democracy, budgets need approval in Congress, where they
are changed beyond recognition as politicians seek to divert money to pet,
and sometimes corrupt, projects.
Brazil is currently without a budget. This year's one was drawn up 13 months
ago but has still not been approved by Congress, the longest delay this
century. Without a budget the government is only allowed to spend a fraction
of its commitments each month.
This may appear a strange way to run a country. But it allows the government
to hinder Congress adding spending amendments to the budget. The government
claims its unapproved budget will balance, although no one knows whether
this is true. But if congressmen were allowed to add amendments, especially
ahead of elections, the budget would certainly go into deficit, undermining
the Real and adding to inflation.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Alarm grows as Nigeria sacks top executives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nigeria's military regime yesterday dissolved the boards of all
government-owned companies and federal agencies, with immediate effect.
The move, which follows the dismissal of army and navy chiefs earlier this
week, contributed to mounting international alarm at the turmoil in Nigeria.
The European Union issued a statement saying it was 'gravely concerned' over
developments in the country, and calling for the restoration of a civil
democracy.
A brief statement from the Nigerian presidency in Abuja, the capital, gave
no explanation for the removal of hundreds of top executives and government
officials. But sacked directors were told to turn in official property in
their care. Among the organisations affected were the Nigerian National
Petroleum Corporation, the Ports Authority and the National Electric Power
Authority.
Nigeria's main parastatals - in oil and gas, telecommunications,
electricity, ports, airlines and heavy industry - are all regarded by the
public as inefficient and corrupt and have been under investigation by
special panels since early this year. Some of these panels have submitted
reports alleging financial mismanagement and fraud, although making no
specific recommendations.
However, yesterday's move has been interpreted as part of President Sani
Abacha's declared aim of taking a hard line against civil opposition, rather
than as a move on corruption. The dissolution of the boards opens the way
for a scramble for key government jobs in the face of stiff opposition to
continued military rule.
Gen Abacha is also widely expected to reshuffle his government soon. The
military regime has been facing mounting criticism since the arrest of Mr
Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of last year's presidential election,
and the sacking of leaders of the oil workers' unions, who have been on
strike for eight weeks.
About 90 per cent of the 100,000 oil workers defied the government's order
to return to work on Thursday, according to oil companies. Labour Minister
Samuel Ogbemudia reacted on Thursday night by sacking the strikers en masse.
The oil unions are demanding the release and installation as Nigerian
president of Mr Abiola, who is facing treason charges for proclaiming
himself president.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Call to ease Taiwan curb on foreign investment in shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Taiwan's top securities regulator yesterday called for the easing of
controls on foreign investment in domestic shares, in remarks exposing sharp
divisions within the government over the pace and scope of financial reform.
'Compared with other countries, we have too many restrictions on foreign
investment,' Mr Day Linin, chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, told a conference on the stock market.
Foreign investors are keen to gain entry to Taiwan's share market, seen as
undervalued relative to other Asian markets. At the same time, the ruling
Nationalist party aims to transform Taiwan into a regional hub for business
and finance. But 'how can Taiwan become a financial centre under the current
restrictions?' Mr Day asked.
Total market capitalisation of the local bourse was USDollars 209bn (Pounds
134bn) at the end of July. But Taiwan has set an overall ceiling of Dollars
7.5bn on funds remitted into the country by approved financial institutions
for direct investment in shares.
The Taiwan stock market was opened to direct foreign investment in 1991.
Each approved foreign institution may remit up to Dollars 200m, but combined
foreign holdings in a single stock may not exceed 10 per cent of outstanding
shares and any one foreign investor may not buy more than 5 per cent of a
listed company's outstanding shares. Individual foreigners are banned from
investing in local shares.
At the end of July, about 100 foreign institutions had applied to invest a
cumulative total of more than Dollars 12bn in Taiwan's stock market. About
60 institutions had been approved to invest Dollars 6bn, of which Dollars
4.5bn had been invested in shares.
Expansion of foreign participation would strengthen the local market's
structure, increase its size and depth, and make it less vulnerable to
manipulation, said Mr Day.
His remarks highlight a longstanding battle between the Finance Ministry,
under which the SEC resides, and the Central Bank of China. The central bank
wields near-absolute power over foreign investment in the bourse through
stringent foreign exchange controls and vets each foreign investor.
It had been hoped that the accession of a new central bank governor, Mr
Liang Kuo-shu, on June 1 would defuse tensions between the feuding agencies.
In late July, the SEC called for the ceiling on foreign investment to be
raised to 10 per cent of total market capitalisation. Mr Liang demurred,
saying that three conditions had to be met before foreigners' market access
would be increased. Total market turnover and capitalisation had to rise
significantly; the government's limping privatisation programme had to be
speeded up to mitigate the weighting of foreign investment in the market;
and annual growth in money supply had to be kept below 15 per cent. He also
said the impact of capital movement on the local currency's exchange rate
must be minimal.
Money supply and inflation have exceeded targets in recent months, making it
unlikely that controls on foreign investment will be lifted soon. But
brokers do expect a gradual easing of restrictions under the government's
long-term financial liberalisation policy.

The increase in GDP between April and June, measured at seasonally adjusted
annualised rates, follows a 3.3 per cent rise in the first quarter of 1994
and a 6.3 per cent increase in last year's final period.
Analysts had expected an upward revision to as much as 4.2 per cent, which
would have raised concerns that the economy was growing too rapidly.
Financial markets yesterday appeared to interpret the moderate increase on
the original estimate as a sign that the Federal Reserve's pre-emptive
tightening of monetary policy to head off inflation was having the desired
effect.
The Commerce Department further damped down fears of over-heating with its
explanation that the higher growth in the second quarter was largely
attributable to a build-up in unsold business inventories, which increased
by Dollars 30.9bn. This was the biggest gain in six years.
The government also reported that after-tax profits of US corporations rose
7.4 per cent in the second quarter in a sharp reversal of the 3.5 per cent
drop in the first period of this year.
The rise in consumer spending in the second quarter was less than the
increase in the opening period.
The rate of growth in housing construction also shrank, to post a 7.3 per
cent rise in the second quarter after a 10 per cent increase in the first
three months of 1994.

anti-corruption campaigner

Strikers protesting at the killing of a leading member of the right-wing
Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party yesterday brought parts of Bombay to a
standstill.
Hundreds of people attended the funeral of Mr Ramdas Nayak, who was shot on
Thursday by gunmen using automatic rifles. The strikers, mainly organised by
Shiv Sena, a radical ally of the BJP, disrupted railway services and forced
shopkeepers and market traders to close.
Banks and big public institutions stayed open but saw little business as
most workers remained at home. The Bombay Stock Exchange was open but
trading was negligible.
Shiv Sena called the strike to put pressure on Mr Sharad Pawar, chief
minister of Maharashtra state which has Bombay as its capital. Mr Pawar
faces mounting criticism about the rise of violent crime in the city and
growing evidence of ties between politicians and underworld bosses.
Mr Nayak was a leading anti-corruption campaigner. But police have said it
is too early to know whether his murder was linked to his attacks on
corruption.
In New Delhi, Mr S B Chavan, the home minister, promised in parliament to
call an all-party meeting on 'the criminalisation of politics' in response
to concerns voiced by MPs about Mr Nayak's death and about the killing of
eight children in a bomb blast on Thursday in the troubled northern state of
Jammu and Kashmir.
Six more relatives of Mr Tiger Memon, who Indian investigators believe
helped organise last year's bomb blasts in Bombay, have been arrested.
They were taken into custody in Dubai and brought to Delhi by air on
Thursday. Those detained are Mr Memon's father and mother - Mr Abdul Razak
Memon and Mrs Hanifa Abdul Razak Memon - three of his brothers and the wife
of one of the brothers. A fourth brother, Mr Yakub Memon, was arrested in
Kathmandu earlier this month and smuggled into India, where investigators
claim he has provided evidence about the blasts.
Mr Yakub Memon has said that the only family member involved in the bombings
was Tiger, who is thought to be in hiding in Pakistan. The whole family left
Bombay for Dubai on the eve of the blasts, on March 12.
The circumstances under which the family has been taken into custody are
unclear. There is speculation that they might have a secret agreement with
the Indian authorities to provide evidence in return for guarantees about
their safety.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Swedish poll shows rise in support for EU entry
</HEADLINE>

Support for Swedish membership of the European Union has moved ahead of
anti-EU opposition for the first time in more than two years, according to
an opinion poll published yesterday.
In a welcome boost for the main government and opposition parties
campaigning for a Yes to EU membership in a referendum to be held on
November 13, the Gallup poll in the daily newspaper Expressen showed support
for joining the Union running at 40 per cent, up from 38 per cent in a
similar poll early in the month and three points ahead of the No camp.
The No side slipped three points from 40 per cent, with 23 per cent
undecided. The poll was further evidence of a trend since the July summer
holiday running in favour of the pro-EU campaign, which is backed by the
leadership of four right-centre governing coalition parties and the
opposition Social Democratic Party.
Another poll last weekend showed a 41-37 lead for the No camp. But it also
showed a four-point fall in the No vote, which during most of this year and
last year has held a strong lead.
If the trend continues, it will brighten the hitherto doubtful prospect of
all three Nordic EU applicants - Finland and Norway as well as Sweden -
joining the Union on schedule at the beginning of 1995, along with Austria.
The Yes camp leads the opinion polls comfortably in Finland, where a
referendum will be held on October 16. The No side still holds its
longstanding lead in Norway, which votes on November 28.
However, a poll in the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten last weekend showed a
three-point rise in support for the EU to 31 per cent, while the No lead
fell four points to 48 per cent. Significantly, respondents, when asked how
they would vote if Finland and Sweden vote to join, produced a No lead of
just 43-42.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Danish pledge to stay on economic path
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Denmark's finance minister vowed yesterday he would not let left-wing
pressure push his economic policy off course.
The Danes face a parliamentary election in autumn and opinion polls suggest
the present four-party centre-left coalition may be returned as a minority
administration dependent on the support of the left-wing Socialist People's
Party (SPP).
'The SPP will not be allowed to lift the level of government expenditure,'
the finance minister, Mr Mogens Lykketoft, told the Financial Times.
He expected, however, that his party would be able to agree policy with the
SPP on other fronts, such as the environment, education and social welfare.
The four-party coalition, dominated by the Social Democratic Party, will
face the autumn election to the Folketing on a date yet to be announced.
The minister's pledge is intended to help persuade the financial markets
that Denmark's economic policy, which aims to keep inflation low and to
eliminate the budget deficit by 1997, will not be changed.
This week he brought forward publication of the 1995 draft budget by a week
for the same reason.
'One could fear that the markets were uncertain whether we would stick to
the fiscal policy which we laid down last year,' he said.
The markets showed no noticeable reaction to the draft budget, leaving the
gap between yields on Danish and German benchmark government bonds unchanged
at about 1.7 per cent.
'We could not really expect to affect the markets,' said Mr Lykketoft.
'Our policy was known, and we have not changed it, but we have proved that
we are holding our course.'
The draft budget, according to the government, involves a real decline in
expenditure of DKr6bn (Pounds 635m) on a budget balancing at DKr392bn
(Pounds 41.5bn).
The budget deficit will fall by only DKr2bn to DKr45.3bn, or 4.6 per cent of
gross domestic product, from 1994 to 1995, despite a strong economic
recovery.
But Mr Lykketoft said the real improvement in the deficit was about DKr12bn.
The revenue benefited from extraordinary income to the tune of DKr10bn in
1994, which disguised the true improvement in the budget between 1994 and
1995, he said.
On present trends, Mr Lykketoft said he expected the budget deficit to be
eliminated in 1997.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Bosnian Serbs rail against partition proposal: Laura Silber
finds little enthusiasm for the plan to hand back a third of the territory
they now hold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We would rather all die than accept this plan, said Mr Bozo Popovic as he
prepared to vote in this weekend's referendum on an international proposal
to end the war in Bosnia.
'There is no world power that can force us to support the (partition) maps,'
continued the elderly Bosnian Serb peasant from where he sat in the battered
town hall of Trnovo, south-east of Sarajevo. 'This is our historic land.'
Mr Popovic's remarks reflect the general defiance of the Bosnian Serbs, and
an overwhelming No is expected in the poll today and tomorrow throughout the
self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb state, despite pressure from the international
community and Serbia proper.
Their leaders have already rejected the plan, which calls for Serbs to hand
over a third of the 70 per cent of Bosnia they currently control. Put
forward by the US, Russia, Germany, France and the UK, it divides the
war-torn country roughly in half between the Bosnian Serbs and the new
Moslem-Croat federation.
Bosnian Serb leaders have been resisting pressure from President Slobodan
Milosevic of Serbia to back the plan amid threats from the international
community to tighten sanctions against Belgrade and lift the arms embargo
against the mostly-Moslem Bosnian army.
Furious with Bosnian Serb intransigence, the rump Yugoslavia (comprising
Serbia and Montenegro) imposed trade sanctions earlier this month against
the self-styled Serb state, stopping delivery of strategic supplies -
including oil - and severing telephone lines.
Mr Dragomir Gagovic, a local boss in Trnovo of the ruling Serbian Democratic
Party, suggested that the embargo was being circumvented.
'Just yesterday 10 fuel tankers passed through Trnovo,' he claimed, and
doubted that the measures amounted to little more than a ploy to hoodwink
the international community.
A town of 7,000 inhabitants before the war, Trnovo changed hands from Serbs
to Moslems and back to Serbs over the past 28 months.
'All but three of 63 surrounding hamlets were completely demolished,' said
Mr Savo Popovic, the burly party boss of the town and Bozo Popovic's nephew.
Despite its dilapidated state, Trnovo remains of crucial strategic
importance for both the Serbs and the Moslems. It lies on the road joining
Serb-held lands in eastern Bosnia with the southern part of their
crescent-shaped statelet.
On the other hand, the Moslems fought a bitter battle for Trnovo, where they
once comprised a 69 per cent majority, in a bid to secure a road-link
between Sarajevo and the Moslem enclaves in eastern Bosnia.
Trnovo is part of the Sarajevo region and the plan places it under UN
administration for an interim period of two years. To the Serbs - there are
no Moslems left - this means more war. 'The maps create islands adrift in a
sea of Moslem enemies,' said Mr Savo Popovic.
His leaders cite the status of Trnovo as one of the key reasons for
rejecting the maps, which they argue obliterate land links between Serb-held
regions and force them to hand over 13 cities, the bulk of power generators
and the fertile river valleys. They complain that the maps destroy the
viability of their self-styled state and give the Moslem-Croat federation an
unfair strategic advantage in any eventual future war.
Also the focus of bitter criticism is the narrow land corridor in the north
linking Belgrade with Serb-held lands in western Bosnia and Croatia. 'We
would not even be able to pass through it on a bicycle, not to mention
lorries or tanks,' said Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader.
He predicted last week that 90 per cent of Bosnian Serbs would vote against
the plan. The Belgrade authorities charge that the figure of 900,000
eligible voters is inflated, pointing out that there are no electoral lists
in Republika Srpska, the self-styled state.
While apparently unanimous in their opposition to the maps, Bosnian Serbs
are confused, but not worried, about the embargo imposed by Mr Milosevic.
They even defend him - they credit him for being the first leader in
post-Tito Yugoslavia to address their grievances - for having no choice but
to impose the blockade.
Mr Savo Popovic dismissed speculation that Mr Milosevic, in meetings
tomorrow in Belgrade with Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister,
will agree to the despatch of some 400 international monitors along the
border between the rump Yugoslavia and Bosnia. In return, the UN has drafted
a resolution to open the airport in Belgrade and lift the ban on
international sports competition.
'The bridge can never be burned between us. We are one nation,' said Mr Savo
Popovic. 'Milosevic will realise that we are defending Serbia here in
Trnovo.'
The 75-year-old uncle, Bozo, seated under a portrait of General Draza
Mihajlovic, his Chetnik commander executed by Tito after the second world
war, agreed that his fellow Serbs will defend their land: no matter what.
'We fought against the Germans with pitchforks, we'll do it again.'

General Alexander Lebed, an outspoken and popular Russian officer, yesterday
scotched Moscow's efforts to disband his army and send him to another
posting.
Gen Lebed's successful defiance of his superiors in the ministry of defence
is another sign of the weakness of Russia's top brass, which has been dogged
this week by allegations of corruption.
Over the past few weeks the ministry of defence has attempted several times
to detach Gen Lebed from the loyal troops of the 14th army which he commands
in Moldova and send him to a remote outpost, most recently the central Asian
republic of Tajikistan.
But the 42-year-old general, who became the darling of the officer corps
earlier this year when he publicly suggested that Russia follow the example
of Pinochet's military dictatorship, has publicly refused to obey.
After a meeting in Moscow yesterday between Gen Lebed and Gen Pavel Grachev,
the Russian defence minister, the ministry appeared to back down.
A spokesman said that, having turned down the offer to command Russian
troops in war-torn Tajikistan, Gen Lebed would remain in charge of the 14th
army.
Gen Grachev made a further, explicit effort at reconciliation, issuing a
statement insisting that the ministry, which has announced Gen Lebed's
dismissal from his post at least twice earlier this month, was not trying to
oust him.
The defence ministry, which has been hotly denying allegations in the
Russian press of high-level corruption, yesterday announced that a senior
office had been caught taking a Dollars 2,000 bribe from a private business
which was renting space from the army.

<TEXT>
Mr Vincenzo Parisi yesterday stepped down as Italy's chief of police as part
of a wide-ranging reshuffle of the country's top law enforcement posts,
writes Andrew Hill in Milan.
Mr Parisi, a former head of the Sisde secret services, was replaced by
Rome's police commissioner, Mr Ferdinando Masone, who will be supported by
three new deputy police chiefs.
Announcing the changes, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, and Mr
Roberto Maroni, the interior minister, praised Mr Parisi's contribution to
the service.
Mr Maroni added that, by beefing up the police hierarchy, the five-month-old
coalition government was showing its determination to continue the fight
against organised crime in Italy.
In a letter to the Italian head of state, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, Mr
Parisi explained that he had decided to bring forward his retirement, due
next year, because the 'difficult problems to be tackled in the near future
required a strong presence'.
Mr Parisi, 63, was appointed police chief in 1984 by Mr Scalfaro, who was
then the interior minister.
In the last year, both he and Mr Scalfaro had been accused by discredited
former chiefs of Sisde of having received covert funds from the secret
services - claims that they have both firmly rejected.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ukrainian president Leonid Kuchma yesterday rejected the Crimean port city
of Sevastopol's unilateral declaration, made earlier this week, that it was
part of Russia.
Mr Kuchma, himself vacationing on the contested peninsula, told reporters
that the decision of the city council of Sevastopol, which is the home port
of the Black Sea Fleet, 'has no legal weight'.
But, beyond making this expected and formulaic statement, Mr Kuchma, who
said he would try to 'persuade' the city council to reverse its decision,
has been remarkably mild in the wake of Sevastopol's separatist ruling. The
recently elected Ukrainian president's unruffled reaction is part of a more
general easing of the hostilities between Ukraine and Russia, which has been
evident this week in the measured responses of both Kiev and Moscow to
Sevastopol's declaration.
Over the past three years, Crimea, transferred from Russia to Ukraine only
in 1954, has often been a lightening rod for deeper tensions between the two
Slavic neighbours. After Crimea's election earlier this year of a separatist
president, who received political advice and financing from Russia, some
analysts, including the CIA, warned that the two countries could come to
blows over the lush peninsula.
But political developments in Crimea this week have suggested that Mr
Kuchma's victory in Ukraine's July presidential race has made that dire
scenario unlikely.
Although Mr Kuchma has backed off from the pro-Russian rhetoric that he
employed on the election campaign trail, he is clearly a leader with whom
the Russians feel they can do business and their reaction to Sevastopol's
break-away bid has been appropriately amiable.
Whereas a year ago the Russian parliament passed its own ruling declaring
Sevastopol to be Russian territory, earlier this week senior Russian
officials dismissed the city's unilateral effort to join Russia as 'illegal'
and said they did not wish to 'warm their hands over Ukraine's troubles'.
Russia's new-found desire to be a good neighbour to Mr Kuchma's Ukraine may
be in part explained by Moscow's perception, as articulated yesterday by Mr
Sergei Karaganov, one of President Boris Yeltsin's foreign policy advisors,
that under Mr Kuchma's new regime 'the old Ukrainian elite, which made its
career on the Ukrainian-Russian conflict, is being ousted.'
Unlike the breakaway regions with strong local ethnic identities, such as
embattled Chechnya, which are bedevilling Russia in the Caucasus, Crimea is
dominated by ethnic Russians whose calls for independence have always been a
thinly veiled plea for reintegration into their perceived motherland.
If Russia is now placing a higher priority on good relations with the new
Ukrainian leadership, Crimeans may have no one to turn to but Mr Kuchma, the
man they overwhelmingly voted for in July.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
All Italians will have to make sacrifices if Italy's state pension system is
to avoid bankruptcy, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, warned
yesterday.
Italian trade unions have been threatening a 'hot autumn' of strikes and
protests against pensions reform, the central plank of a 1995 budget which
must raise or save at least L45,000bn (Pounds 18.5bn) to bring down the
deficit.
Mr Berlusconi, who yesterday chaired the first cabinet meeting since the
summer holiday, told journalists the government would seek a dialogue with
the unions.
'Unfortunately (the measures) will be unpopular,' he said, but as things
stand at the moment, there is no alternative to a change in the pensions
system.'
He added: 'Accumulated (pensions) rights will not be touched, but we have to
restructure this area to avoid the state going bankrupt and not being able
to pay pensions.'
Having weathered a political storm before the holidays, Mr Berlusconi
clearly intended yesterday's press conference in Rome to dispel any
lingering doubts, in political or financial circles, about the coalition's
coherence and its determ - ination to take decisive action during the
autumn.
The 1995 budget was not on the formal agenda of yesterday's cabinet meeting.
But the prime minister promised that a detailed budget plan would be
presented to the Italian parliament well before the deadline of September
30, and that 'for the first time, it will meet requirements not by
increasing taxes but by reducing public spending'.
Mr Berlusconi was also obliged to declare his personal confidence in the
governor of the Bank of Italy, Mr Antonio Fazio, following a series of
attacks on the central bank by members of the National Alliance, the
far-right partner in the ruling coalition.
He said he could not understand how anyone could doubt the government's
willingness to respect the bank's independence, and dismissed the comments
of National Alliance politicians as 'personal opinions'.
Mr Berlusconi also urged the media to concentrate on 'concrete facts instead
of idle chatter'.
To underpin his message, the prime minister cited an opinion poll, to be
published at the weekend, which indicates that support for the ruling
coalition has increased from 48.4 per cent at the height of pre-summer
crisis, to 53.8 per cent.

<TEXT>
Hoechst, the German chemicals group, is to shake out its fine chemicals and
textile dyes operations with the loss of more than 1,000 jobs over the next
15 months, writes Christopher Parkes in Frankfurt.
The company, which this week reported a 39 per cent increase in first-half
profits, said 'massive price pressure' from Asian dyestuffs makers had
obliged it to restructure its business at three sites in and around
Frankfurt, and transfer some of the productive capacity abroad. Fine
chemicals had also been hit by low prices and newcomers to the market,
especially in Asia. The company said it would concentrate in future only on
more sophisticated products such as intermediaries - vehicles for active
ingredients in drugs, for example - and food additives.
Almost 300 of the affected jobs were to go by the end of this year through
early retirement schemes, and the company said it hoped to negotiate
voluntary redundancy agreements for the rest.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Clinton faces weakening of healthcare plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A tired President Bill Clinton yesterday prepared to leave Washington for an
abbreviated summer break, facing the prospect that he may have to accept a
watered down bill on healthcare reform, the cornerstone of his domestic
agenda.
In spite of his victory in securing passage of the controversial crime bill
on Thursday night, Mr Clinton's supporters seemed to be laying the ground
for a less ambitious healthcare bill.
Senator George Mitchell, Democratic leader in the Senate, indicated he was
scrapping comprehensive healthcare reform and using a narrower blueprint as
the basis of a compromise.
Mr Leon Panetta, the White House chief of staff, also indicated that the
president's threat to veto any bill that did not guarantee universal
coverage was being eroded.
Once Congress returns next month, it will face a mountain of unfinished
business apart from healthcare - including campaign finance and welfare
reform, Uruguay Round trade pact approval, education, environment and ethics
bills and telecoms regulation.
The crowded agenda will make it harder than ever to achieve consensus over
healthcare before Congress breaks before the November mid-term elections.
After one of the ugliest political seasons in recent memory, Mr Clinton
appeared deeply dispirited even as he welcomed the Senate's final approval
of the crime bill on a 61-38 vote.
'With a little good faith and a lot of hard work, Republicans and Democrats
overcame the partisan divisions and false choices that have blocked
anti-crime efforts time and time again,' he said. Six Republicans left party
ranks to break a Senate filibuster that had tied up the crime bill. They
gave the president a much-needed victory, but one tarnished by Republican
claims that the bill is filled with unnecessary social spending.
The congressional debate has fed public scepticism about the government and
uncertainty that anything will change as a result of the crime bill, which
will provide Dollars 30bn (Pounds 19.3bn) over six years for new prisons,
extra police and social programmes.
Mr Clinton, heading off to Martha's Vineyard, the play-ground of the eastern
political establishment, could only hope for a repeat performance of his
holiday last summer. Wined, dined and petted, he came roaring back to secure
a tough victory for the North American Free Trade Agreement and a surge in
his poll ratings.
This time Cuba leads the list of his foreign policy problems, while at home,
the Whitewater investigation continues. It may be too much even for the
'Comeback Kid' to manage.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Lady Archer told of bid before share deal: Stock Exchange to
check if rules for directors were followed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lady Archer attended an Anglia Television board meeting, at which MAI's
detailed terms for its proposed takeover were first discussed, on the day
before her husband Lord Archer placed his first order for the purchase of
Anglia shares.
Details were yesterday disclosed for the first time of the price-sensitive
information Lady Archer possessed at the time her husband placed
instructions with stockbrokers to buy 50,000 Anglia shares.
She has told Anglia that she passed no inside information to her husband.
However, it emerged yesterday that the London Stock Exchange is examining
whether Lady Archer took sufficient steps, under its Yellow Book rules, to
prevent her husband from being involved in Anglia share dealings before the
Pounds 292m takeover of the television company by MAI.
Lord Archer said earlier this week that placing these orders, on behalf of
an acquaintance, Mr Broosk Saib, was a 'grave error' and apologised to his
wife for any embarrassment he may have caused her. The Department of Trade
and Industry has decided not to take any further action against him
following a five-month inquiry into alleged insider trading.
The DTI inspectors were informed that Lady Archer was present at an Anglia
directors' meeting on January 12, when the full board was for the first time
told MAI's proposed bid terms. MAI's planned bid, at that stage, was about
610p a share, compared with the stock market price at the time of 482p and
the terms eventually put to Anglia shareholders of 637p a share.
The following day, Lord Archer telephoned stockbrokers Charles Stanley, a
firm he had never used before, and instructed it to purchase 25,000 Anglia
shares.
The day after, he placed an order for the purchase of a further 25,000
shares. The cost of buying the 50,000 shares was about Pounds 250,000. On
January 18, when the takeover was publicly announced, he placed instructions
to sell the shares, netting a dealing profit of Pounds 80,000.
The cheque for the profit was made out to Mr Saib, although it was sent to
Lord Archer's London penthouse near Vauxhall Bridge, overlooking the Thames.
Lady Archer said yesterday that she had not tendered her resignation from
the Anglia board and said it was 'impertinent' to ask whether she intended
to resign. She has told Anglia that she takes very seriously her fiduciary
duty not to disclose confidential information relating to the company.
Her papers are kept in an outbuilding of the family home at Grantchester
near Cambridge.
Lady Archer was also present at the board meeting, held at Anglia's merchant
bank, SG Warburg in the City, on January 16, which finally agreed that the
company would be taken over by MAI. The first board meeting to discuss the
MAI approach was on January 5, but at that stage it was unclear whether the
takeover would take place.
It emerged yesterday that the stock exchange, having been given a copy of
the DTI inspectors report, is examining whether Lady Archer fulfilled all
her obligations under its Yellow Book of rules governing the behaviour of
listed companies. Any serious breach would be publicly censured by the
exchange.
The exchange's Continuing Obligations department is determining whether Lady
Archer took sufficient steps to prevent her husband from placing the share
orders and whether she properly fulfilled her responsibility to disclose any
dealings by her spouse.
The Yellow Book's code for directors states that a director must 'seek to
prohibit any dealing in securities of the listed company during a closed
period or at a time when the director is in possession of unpublished price
sensitive information in relation to those securities' by or on behalf of
any member of the director's family. The code also states that the director
must tell family members when they cannot deal, for example in the run-up to
a takeover, 'unless his duty of confidentiality to the company prohibits him
from disclosing such periods'.
It says: 'A list of dealings in the securities of the company since the date
of the previous list should be circulated to members of the board with the
board papers for each board meeting.'

FT  27 AUG 94 / US leads fresh surge in markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN THOMPSON and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Equity markets on both sides of the Atlantic surged yesterday in the wake of
further encouraging economic news from the US this week.
The FT-SE 100 index of leading UK stocks rose 30.9 to 3,265.1 - its highest
closing level since mid-March - rounding off a week of strong gains that
have left the index up 2.2 per cent.
On Wall Street higher bond prices, encouraging economic news, a firmer
dollar and heavy computerised program buying lifted the Dow Jones Industrial
Average 51.16 to 3,881.05, a level not seen since mid-March. After the Dow's
25-point rise on Tuesday and Wednesday's 70-point surge, the average of
blue-chip stocks has risen 125 points, or 3.3 per cent, since Monday.
This week's buying was the most sustained on Wall Street since the Federal
Reserve began raising interest rates in February in an attempt to restrain
inflation.
Yesterday's gains were mainly due to a jump in US government bond prices
prompted by only a slight upwards revision of second quarter economic growth
estimates to 3.8 per cent. Traders had feared a larger upward revision would
make a further rise in interest rates more likely.
Frankfurt ended a cautious week by posting a 1.6 per cent rise in
post-bourse trading. Paris went 1.8 per cent higher, and Zurich rose 1.2 per
cent.

FT  27 AUG 94 / August sales disappoint carmakers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New car registrations in the first 20 days of August, the most important new
car sales month of the year, rose by only 0.5 per cent from the same period
a year ago, prompting concern among carmakers that the recovery in sales is
faltering.
Registrations after the first 10 days were 3.7 per cent higher, already well
below the industry consensus that sales would rise by 13-14 per cent to
about 500,000 registrations for the month.
Sales weakened even further during the second 10 days. It is thought about
327,448 new cars were registered in the first 20 days, only a marginal
increase from the 325,792 registered in the same period last year.
UK new car registrations in August are traditionally boosted by the change
of registration prefix. The month accounts for about a quarter of all new
car sales.
Dealers and manufacturers are particularly concerned that it is the weakness
of retail sales rather than fleet orders that is undermining the market.
A leading car importer explained: 'The industry usually enters August with
advanced retail orders and with advanced fleet orders, and then there is a
further surge in retail sales. This year there does not seem to have been
the second wave of retail customers coming in.'
August is the most important month for retail sales, with purchases by
private customers and small businesses making up 70 per cent of sales with
the balance taken by fleet operators.
During the first 20 days retail sales fell by 5.8 per cent year-on-year. The
car market as a whole was only sustained by a 13 per cent increase in fleet
sales.
A senior executive with a leading UK carmaker said last night: 'Showroom
traffic slowed from the end of the first week of August. It is not a
disaster, but it is less than we hoped for, and we are surprised that there
are fewer retail buyers. There's lots of advertising in place, but it just
does not seem to be coming through.'
The UK has helped lead the European new vehicle market out of recession this
year. In the first seven months new car registrations rose 13.3 per cent
year-on-year to 990,752.

Shorco Group Holdings maintained its improvement with pre-tax profits up
sharply from Pounds 80,000 to Pounds 306,000 in the first half of 1994.
Turnover of the USM-quoted group, which has interests in trench support
systems and allied equipment, rose 27 per cent from Pounds 3.33m to Pounds
4.21m.
Basic earnings per share reached 6.6p (1.7p) or 6.5p fully diluted and the
interim dividend is stepped up to 2.7p (2.4p). A 1-for-2 scrip issue is

FT  26 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Graham advances 25% but cautions on housing
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The housing market has become more uncertain in the last three months
according to Graham Group, the recently floated builders' merchant which
yesterday announced a 25 per cent increase in interim profits.
Mr Ian Mills, managing director, said the rate of growth in the housing
market was expected to slow in the second half. Low price inflation of 1.5
per cent and a glut of newly-built houses were expected to hinder the
market. 'It is a recovery that has a lot of uncertainty around it,' he said.
Mr Mills said that although the housebuilding market had 'stormed ahead' in
the first half, Graham's business was more dependent on builders fitting out
the inside of houses. 'We have to be sure that the houses which have been
built will in fact sell through.'
In spite of such concerns, Mr Mills was sure the group - demerged from BTR
in March through a Pounds 210m flotation - would perform well this year. The
core plumbing, kitchens and bathrooms side increased market share in the
first half.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 7.28m on a pro forma basis to Pounds 9.13m
for the six months to June 30, on sales ahead 11 per cent at Pounds 203.3m.
The profits expansion reflected efforts to improve margins by selling a
better mix of product. Operating margins rose from 4.2 per cent to 4.9 per
cent in the first half.
Graham's Pounds 36m three-year refurbishment programme was already beginning
to bear fruit, Mr Mills said. Sales were ahead by 45 per cent in revamped
outlets which had been open for more than six months, against a group
average of 16 per cent like-for-like growth. Eleven sites had already been
refurbished and a further 20 would be completed in the second half.
The maiden interim dividend is 1.75p, payable from earnings per share
increased by 23 per cent on a pro forma basis to 5.3p.
COMMENT
Graham's gloomy comments say more about the group's caution than the market.
All those houses that have been built will eventually have to be kitted out
with bathrooms and kitchens, so whatever happens, sales will come through at
some stage. On its own merits, Graham has a lot to go for and seems to be
making all the right moves. The results are beginning to show through in the
margin improvement and in increased market share. Forecasts are for about
Pounds 18m this year, giving a prospective multiple of 18. The group's real
recovery, however, is a year and a half away. Investors who bought in at the
flotation are sitting quite nicely. Otherwise, the shares are pretty well up
with events.

FT  26 AUG 94 / (CORRECTED) Performance of Tecs shows much improvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 31st August 1994) appended to this article.
Big improvements in the performance of individual training and enterprise
councils were revealed yesterday by the Department of Employment.
Figures showed more unemployed people gaining qualifications, as well as
more obtaining jobs.
Seven performance indicators were used to assess the relative performance of
the 82 employer-led Tecs in relation to their delivery of publicly funded
training in England and Wales.
Tecs, the oldest of which is four years old, have been put in the spotlight
recently by speculation that Mr Michael Portillo, the new employment
secretary, wants to slash their Pounds 1.8bn training budget.
Ms Ann Clwyd, the acting shadow employment secretary, yesterday wrote to Mr
Portillo calling for him to 'categorically confirm' that he was not seeking
to halve Tecs' budgets. It was difficult, she said, for Tecs to operate
successfully when such rumours existed.
The indicators show a substantial, if uneven, reduction in the cost incurred
by Tecs to get jobs and/or qualifications for those on Youth Training, which
guarantees a training place for young people, and Training for Work, the
programme for long-term unemployed people.
TFW, which is probably the programme more vulnerable to cuts, showed a
particularly strong improvement. The number of qualifications gained per
hundred leavers rose nearly 50 per cent on last year's performance, with an
average 40 per cent fall in the cost of points towards a qualification.
The Tec National Council, which represents Tecs, said they had delivered
efficiency improvements every year since taking over provision of the
programmes from the government's Training Agency in 1990.
While their budgets had declined, they had served the same number of clients
with increased performance. Mr Chris Humphries, policy adviser to the
council, said he hoped that the improved performance would be rewarded by
maintenance of budgets, not cuts.
Mr James Paice, the employment minister, said the indices showed the better
value for money that the taxpayer was receiving. But there should be 'no let
up' in the effort the government made to help Tecs improve their
performance.
The indices measured the cost incurred by each Tec in gaining individual
qualifications, as well as the number of national vocational qualifications
per 100 leavers. In the case of TFW, the number of people in jobs on a
specific date was also measured.
The department has not prepared a list of the best and worst Tecs. It is
understood that this is because there are no consistent patterns and it
would be difficult to reflect improvements in individual performances over
the previous year.
A crude league table places Cumbria, Barnsley/Doncaster and Hereford and
Worcester Tecs at the top. The London Tecs, which are among the youngest,
are among the worst performers - but some of these have made substantial
improvements on last year.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Triple blow to Texaco refinery caused blast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lightning strikes and the fracturing of a corroded pipe were part of a
sequence of events which caused the explosion at Texaco's Milford Haven
refinery on July 24.
The Sunday lunchtime explosion caused extensive damage to the south Wales
plant and started a fire, although there were no serious injuries.
Production has yet to resume.
The cost of lost output has not been divulged, but the damage alone runs
into millions of pounds.
Texaco has completed its preliminary investigation. Its final report will
not be made until the result of a separate inquiry by the Health and Safety
Executive. The HSE, which is expected to publish its preliminary report
soon, still has inspectors on site.
Mr Phil Walters, Texaco personnel superintendent, said yesterday: 'There
were three separate occurrences. It is unusual to have them together, but
that's what we did and that's what caused the explosion.'
The first was a thunderstorm. Lightning caused a fire at a crude oil unit
and caused power interruptions. Texaco's inquiry team reported: 'Pumps and
cooling fans tripped out and there were many alarms on the panel and some of
the information on levels and flows was misleading.'
As a result there was a build-up of liquid hydrocarbon which tripped a
compressor, and a mixture of vapour and liquid reached the flare system
without being registered by monitors. The flare system was not designed for
liquid.
The third event was the compressor tripping again and the mixture being
discharged from the flare drum into an overflow pipe.
The pipe, not intended for liquid, vibrated and fell to the ground. The pipe
had been thinned by corrosion on the inside and was nearing the end of its
service life.
Leaking liquid and vapour became an explosive mixture which was ignited by a
heater.
The inquiry team said of the causes: 'Each of these on its own could have
caused a less severe incident, but in combination resulted in this more
serious situation.'
One of the team's recommendations is to have more conservative criteria for
replacement of the refinery's piping systems.
Texaco expects limited production to resume next month but the plant will
not be back in full production until the end of October.
None of the 630 staff has been laid off and the usual contract labour force
of 400 has been increased to 1,500 to deal with the repairs.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Toronto-Dominion Bank, Canada's fifth-largest bank, achieved a 59 per cent
gain in third-quarter earnings.
The bank attributed the rise to a strengthening economy and improvement in
its business loan portfolio.
Net non-performing loans dropped below CDollars 1bn (USDollars 727m) for the
first time since 1990 and the fiscal 1994 loan-loss estimate has been
reduced by CDollars 50m to CDollars 400m. Commercial property remains the
main area of concern.
Net profit for the three months ended July 31 was CDollars 162m, or 50 cents
a share, against CDollars 102m, or 32 cents, a year earlier. Return on
assets rose to 0.66 per cent from 0.49 per cent.
Nine-months' profit was CDollars 488m, or CDollars 1.52 a share, against
CDollars 272m, or 57 cents.
National Bank of Canada reported a 20 per cent gain in third-quarter
earnings with strong business and personal loan demand.
Net profit was CDollars 57.4m, or 29 cents, up from CDollars 47.3m, or 27
cents, a year earlier. Nine-months' profit was CDollars 159.9m, or 83 cents
a share, up 21 per cent from CDollars 132.4m, or 78 cents.
Return on assets rose to 0.53 per cent from 0.48 per cent in the third
quarter and to 0.50 per cent from 0.46 per cent in the nine months. Total
assets at July 31 were CDollars 44bn, up 11 per cent from a year earlier.

<TEXT>
Sudzucker, one of Germany's largest dairy, frozen food and baking companies,
will merge its frozen foods operations division with Konsul Senator
Scholler, the ice-cream group, Mr Klaus Fleck, Sudzucker chairman, announced
yesterday during the annual shareholders meeting. Sudzucker, which did not
disclose the purchase price, said it would form a new company called
Scholler Holding. Sudzucker will hold a 65 per cent stake while the
remaining stake 35 per cent stake will be held by Scholler. Sudzucker, which
is based in Mannheim, made a net profit of DM151m (Dollars 96.1m) in the
year ended February 1994 and had a turnover of DM5.2bn. Mr Fleck said he
expected the merger would boost Sudzucker's group sales to DM6.4bn next
year. These would further increase by DM1.5bn to DM7.9bn in 1996.  Net
profit would increase by between DM40m and DM50m.
The merger, which will be referred to the Federal Cartel Office, is expected
to have sales of DM2.6bn in the year beginning February 1995 and will employ
10,000 people.

Logitech, the world leader in pointing devices (mice and trackballs) for
computers, slumped to an SFr8.6m (Dollars 6.51m) loss in the three months to
June 30 compared with a profit of SFr8.8m in the same period of 1993.
The directors blamed lower margins, high operating expenses and
extraordinary charges for the setback.
Sales were down 7.9 per cent to SFr103.5m, with about half of the decline
accounted for by currency effects. Restructuring charges of SFr2m
contributed to the loss in the current period. There was a SFr3.1m capital
gain in the comparative period.

FT  26 AUG 94 / International Company News: Krupp Hoesch cuts loss to DM47m
in first six months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Krupp Hoesch, the merged steel and engineering group, yesterday said it had
slashed losses to DM47m (Dollars 29.90m) for the first six months, compared
with a DM324m deficit for the same period last year.
The Essen-based group operated profitably during June for the first time
since the merger in December 1992. It forecast a break-even by the end of
the year and said that steel would be the only one of the six divisions to
be making a loss, although it would be much lower than the DM780m loss
reported in 1993.
Aggressive cost-cutting and savings created by bringing together
complementary sectors within the two groups had helped the performance, a
spokesman said.
The company shed 11,041 workers, or 13 per cent of the workforce, in the 12
months to June 30 and said it would shed about 2,000 more before the end of
the year. This would bring the workforce to around 70,000, down from about
95,000 at the time of the merger.
Strong exports and signs that the German market is pulling out of its worst
post-war recession also aided the recovery. Turnover in the first six months
rose 6 per cent to DM10bn, while group orders increased 12 per cent to
DM11.2bn.
Steel sales, which make up about 30 per cent of group turnover, rose 3 per
cent while orders climbed 18 per cent. However, industry sources said that
while the upturn in the US economy was reducing excess European capacity,
demand still needed to improve before prices could recover.
Sales at the group's automotive division rose 10 per cent over the previous
period while orders jumped 20 per cent to DM1.52bn, helped by better
prospects for the European motor industry and by strong results from
subsidiaries in Brazil, Mexico and the US.
Figures for the plant-making division, where sales leapt 58 per cent and new
orders fell 18 per cent on the same period a year ago, reflected accounting
practices with several large orders just booked. The group hopes to secure
three large international contracts over the next six months.
The German Steel Federation said second quarter orders at German steelmakers
totalled 10.3m tonnes, 19 per cent higher than a year earlier but slightly
lower than the 10.4m tonnes ordered in the first quarter of this year.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Venezuela acts over economy
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Venezuela's cabinet this week approved an outline economic stabilisation
plan designed to attack inflation and bolster government revenues. Approval
of the final version is expected next week.
The move has been prompted by a deteriorating economic background.
Venezuela's GDP contracted by 1 per cent last year and the recession has
deepened this year.
Officials have not released details of the programme, but it is expected to
include the following elements:
Staggered increases in the retail price of petrol on the domestic market.
High-octane petrol currently only costs about 13 US cents per US gallon at
the pump in Venezuela, which loses PDVSA, the national oil company, millions
of dollar a year and cuts potential income to the Treasury. The government
hopes to offset the effects of higher prices by giving a special monthly
bonus to workers.
Commitment to reform the system of accumulated severance benefits for
workers. The present system carries a high cost for public and private
sector employers and discourages the creation of new jobs.
A new type of government bond, denominated in dollars (or linked to the
value of the dollar), which is meant to replace zero-coupon bonds issued
weekly by the central bank to absorb excess liquidity in the financial
system. The government believes that the zero-coupon bonds, denominated in
Venezuelan bolivars, carry an excessively high cost.

Argentina's Supreme Court yesterday dropped accusations against Iranian
officials who were named over an anti-Jewish bomb attack last month in which
nearly 100 people died, Reuter reports from Buenos Aires.
The court decided there was insufficient evidence against the officials and
voted topass the case back to inves-tigating Judge Juan Jose Galeano,
members of the court said.
In his report on the bombing, Judge Galeano named four Iranian officials as
wanted in connection with the July 18 attack that razed Argentina's main
Jewish community centre. Under Argentine law, the Supreme Court would take
on the case if foreign diplomats or officials were suspected to be involved.

<TEXT>
The new leadership in Belarus raised vodka prices yesterday by 75 per cent
and hard-pressed drinkers accused President Alexander Lukashenko of going
back on election promises to make food and drink cheaper. The price of a 0.7
litre (11 oz) bottle leapt to 6,900 Belarussian roubles (Dollars 2.50). Mr
Lukashenko won last month's presidential election by a landslide on pledges
to root out corruption and roll back price increases for food and drink. But
since taking office, he has appointed a reformist prime minister and
resolved to introduce market measures quickly and to tackle alcoholism.
Yesterday's price increase for vodka was the second since his election and
prices of bread and milk have risen fivefold.

Russian interior ministry troops have been sent to the Dagestan region on
the Caspian Sea to prevent a cholera epidemic from spreading, Itar-Tass news
agency said yesterday. A spokesman called the measure 'forced and
temporary', saying the force was specially trained and equipped. At least 17
people have died from cholera, a further 686 are ill and 669 have been
diagnosed as carrying the disease, which can kill in a few hours by severe
dehydration from diarrhoea. A senior Moscow health official said on
Wednesday that it would take until mid-October to eliminate the epidemic.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Thousands of miners to leave Siberia: Russia reveals mass
resettlement plans as inefficient pits are closed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
About 50,000 Russian coalminers and their families, who face redundancy as
pits in the far north of the country are shut down, will be resettled by the
Russian government, senior officials from the industry said yesterday.
The miners and their families, who live in barely inhabitable Siberian
settlements where the pits are the only source of employment, represent a
larger social problem which Russia is confronting, as inefficient factories
are beginning to shut down in remote areas of Russia.
Siberia is filled with cities, like the mining towns, whose entire
populations could be left jobless and with little possibility of finding
employment elsewhere if the Russian government resists pressure to bail out
failing state factories with inflationary soft loans.
The social ripple-effect of industrial closures is exacerbated by the role
Russian mines and factories have traditionally played as the main providers
of social welfare facilities in the towns and cities where they were
located.
'We do not intend to throw anyone out on the streets,' said Mr Yuri
Malyshev, head of Rosugol, the state coal producers' association. 'We are
talking of veterans here who have worked all their lives in the north and
are now impoverished in conditions of hyper-inflation.'
He said that 50,000 coalminers and their families from the mining settlement
of Vorkuta and the northern region as a whole would be moved over the next
few years.
However, so far only 500 families have been resettled in more hospitable
southern areas of the country, and to date Rosugol has acquired a total of
only 1,800 flats for the hard-pressed mining families.
The Russian government is facing growing pressure from cash-strapped
industries and agriculture to release more funds but fears triggering a new
round of inflation. It has earmarked Rbs300bn (Dollars 140m at the market
rate) for the resettlement programme this year, but Mr Malyshev said that
only part of the money had so far been released to Rosugol.
Russian coal production was down 12 per cent in the first half of this year,
compared with last year's figures, as the industry, confronting a depletion
of reserves and crumbling infrastructure, struggles to restructure.
Mr Malyshev said that 37 mines and one open cast pit had to be shut if the
coal industry was to adapt to Russia's new, tougher, economic climate.
However, so far only one mine, the Khalmer-U in Vorkuta, has been closed.
The high social cost of the Russian government's fiscal and monetary
austerity was further underscored yesterday when 2,000 farmers called for
President Boris Yeltsin's resignation at a rally in Moscow.
The farmers, trapped in the country's growing debt crisis, said the
government paid for last year's crop several months late, a time lag which
allowed inflation to consume part of the farms' revenues.
At the demonstration, which included an address by Mr Gennady Zyuganov, the
Communist party leader, farmers also complained that financially squeezed
Russian factories were unable to supply sufficient and timely agricultural
inputs and machinery.

FT  26 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Tomkins active
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLARE GASCOIGNE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Volume in conglomerate Tomkins soared to one of its highest ever levels
after 25m shares were dealt, making it the day's most actively traded stock,
after it forecast a 15.2 per cent dividend increase in a trading statement.
Analysts said the increase is enough to trigger conversion from the
convertible preference shares to the ordinary shares, which could help tidy
the balance sheet in preparation for an acquisition. The group's last
takeover was foods group RHM in 1992.
The shares raced forward early in the session and were 13 ahead at the day's
best on news that the current year dividend will be 8.5p, and that trading
for the year to April 1995 had started well. They eventually came off the
top after several analysts said there was 'little new' information in the
statement, to close a net 3 1/2 better at 245 1/2 p.
Goldman Sachs was said to have been a keen buyer of the shares following
recent presentations by the chief executive in the US.
Mr Andrew Mitchell at Smith New Court said yesterday's announcement was a
further signal that it wished to return to the acquisition trail.
International news and electronic information group Reuters Holdings lifted
8 1/2 to 512 1/2 p on consideration of a reiterated buy note from Goldman
Sachs. The note focused on Instinet, the company's US-based equity brokerage
service.
The announcement of swingeing job cuts by regional electricity company
Norweb as a response to the government's price restrictions was taken
exceptionally well by the market. Norweb stressed that many of the 1,200
staff facing redundancy would be nearing retirement and able to take
voluntary redundancy. But the bottom line for the market was, said Yamaichi,
'minimum 6 to 8 per cent real dividend growth and at least Pounds 40m in
non-core earnings by 2000 ..a short-term target of 950p'. The shares rose 17
to 822p.
Positive figures from satellite broadcaster BSkyB helped 17 per cent
stakeholder Pearson rise 8 to 655p.
Sadly for former Sunday Express editor Ms Eve Pollard, her departure was
taken well by the market. United Newspapers, owner of the ailing weekend
tabloid, gained 8 to 553p on the news that she was being replaced by Daily
Star editor Mr Brian Hitchen. However, optimism might also have been focused
on the talk that former Sun editor Mr Kelvin Mackenzie would take over the
helm at the Star, also part of the United group.
Allied Colloids shed 2 to 144p as a two-way pull developed on the stock.
Smith New Court recently featured the stock as one of its stars in the
sector but, yesterday, NatWest Securities said the shares had run 'too far
too fast' and advised investors to take profits.
Speculation that Granada Group was planning to bid for Gardner Merchant
restaurant chain ensured that the shares closed only a penny ahead at 499p
despite good news from BSkyB in which the leisure group has a significant
stake. There was heavy turnover of 7.3m shares but dealers said some stock
continued to overhang the shares.
Interim results from Guardian Royal Exchange, which showed profits more than
doubled at Pounds 131m, and Willis Corroon, down from Pounds 63.1m to Pounds
54.1m, were largely in line with expectations. GRE rose 2 to 184p and Willis
Coroon dropped a penny to 153p.
Mr Trevor May at BZW increased his full-year forecasts for GRE by Pounds 10m
to Pounds 275m. 'It is doing all the right things,' he said. 'GRE is one of
the smallest but one of the healthiest; there is fundamental value there.'
Elsewhere, a stock shortage helped Royal Insurance move ahead 3 to 293p.
Among the life companies, bargain hunters helped push Legal &amp; General up 11
1/2 to 464p. Interim results from Graham Group, their first since flotation
from parent BTR in March, initially took the shares 3 higher. The stock
failed to maintain the early rise and dropped back to close a net 2 off at
190p.
Slough Estates, up 3 at 259p, was also slightly ahead of forecasts, with
profit up 16 per cent at Pounds 33.3m, while Hambro Countrywide dropped 5
1/2 to 49p after moving to losses of Pounds 707,000 compared with a Pounds
13.3m profit last time.
MEPC outperformed the market, closing 10 up at 464p, with analysts taking a
positive view of its overseas exposure.
Services group Rentokil wasthe day's biggest faller among FT-SE 100
constituents after interim figures from the company disappointed the market.
The shares fell 11 1/2 to 222p, after sizeable volume of 2.6m.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Food retailer Kwik Save soared as contrasting stories did the rounds in the
market. One tale was that Kwik Save was planning to acquire the Lo-Cost food
retail chain from Argyll Group.
Another view held that 29.2 per cent stake holder Dairy Farm, a Hong-Kong
based group, planned to sell its stake in Kwik Save - a move that could
trigger a bid from the purchaser. However, both stories were treated with
some caution by analysts.
Dealers also said that German discount food retailer Aldi was looking for a
UK alliance and Kwik Save could be a candidate. The favourite for such an
alliance remains Gateway.
Shares in Kwik Save closed 37 ahead at 649p, while Argyll put on a more
modest 7 1/2 to 303 1/2 p, after volume of 5.2m.

FT  26 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Eastern up on US buying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLARE GASCOIGNE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eastern Electricity, the UK's leading regional electricity company (Rec),
jumped as US investors bought the stock heavily in anticipation of further
gains. The shares rose 26 to 848p on turnover of 4.4m and in expectation of
a generously priced share buy-back by the company.
US investment banks Goldman Sachs and Salomon Brothers were both said to be
pursuing the stock, and the price was pushed additionally higher following
heavy options turnover the previous day.
Also, agency broker James Capel had been telling clients that, although the
shares were technically on a market rating, they were cheap if the value of
the National Grid flotation - due next year - was stripped out.
The details of the flotation are as yet unknown, but the Recs are keen to
hand surplus cash back to shareholders and Capel believes it makes no sense
for the Recs to sell their stake in the National Grid or to retain any of
the stake for themselves. If they are to give it all away that would strip
almost 200p from the share price and put them on a yield relative of around
120 per cent to the market.

FT  26 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities make good progress in active
trading - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK stock market gave an immediate and positive response to the 71-point
surge of Wall Street overnight, mirroring a general upsurge in markets
across the world.
Adding to the euphoric mood in the UK market was a feeling that the big
institutions will now focus sharply on what is expected to be a strong
upsurge in earnings and dividends payments in coming weeks as the September
reporting season gets under way.
At the close of trading the FT-SE 100 index ended 29.0 higher at 3,234.2,
its best level since March 17 and a rise of almost 63 points over the past
three days. The FT-SE Mid Cap index, which has been left behind by the
market's senior index recently, jumped 27.3 to 3,789.4, its highest level
since April 28 this year.
The upsurge in share prices was given increased credence by market
specialists who pointed to another substantial increase in the level of
business transacted in London.
Turnover reached 843.5m shares, the heaviest single day's business for some
months and with the market leaders accounting for almost half of that
figure, indicating a sharp increase in the level of institutional buying in
the FT-SE 100 stocks.
Analysts said the value of customer business in the market on Wednesday
reached Pounds 1.68bn - the highest for some time - and added that
marketmakers had reported a surge of retail buying interest yesterday.
Dealers in the UK were slightly unnerved by the power and pace of Wall
Street's performance, which followed a surprisingly large 4.2 per cent fall
in durable goods orders. Wall Street was also supported by a better than
expected auction for some Dollars 11bn-worth of five-year bonds.
The FT-SE 100 began the day 33 points higher, as marketmakers hoisted their
opening prices to try and head off any over-aggressive buying interest in
areas where the market was known to be short of stock.
Renewed buying of the FT-SE future drove its premium to fair value up to
around 30 points shortly after the opening but slipped back thereafter to
end the session at around seven points.
A strong opening and subsequent performance by gilts, which remained well
bid all day, helped underpin the equity market.
Activity in equities began to tail off around midday when the future turned
off, a move which triggered a flurry of arbitrage activity in the future and
the cash market.
But any selling of equities was generally well absorbed, dealers said. A
disappointing opening by Wall Street, which moved quickly into negative
territory shortly after the start of trading, did little damage to European
markets. The FT-SE 100 trickled back to end the session still in good shape,
and was influenced by a very heavy two-way trading programme, said to have
been executed by BZW, the leading UK investment bank, and worth in excess of
Pounds 100m.
The regional electricity stocks continued to race ahead, still boosted by
share buy back stories, stakebuilding rumours and a generally bullish
outlook for the companies. There was aggressive buying of Eastern
Electricity with marketmakers noting persistent bids on the inter-dealer
broker network. And Norweb rose strongly after the group announced big job
cuts.
Standard Chartered moved up amid suggestions that a broker's buy circular is
imminent while Redland rose strongly for the same reason. There was big
switching in recently strong Prudential shares into Legal &amp; General.
Meanwhile, the composites, which have been strongly supported as gilts and
equities moved up strongly, came under pressure as profit-takers moved in.
Rentokil's interims were given a poor reception.

The derivatives sector had a strong session as dealers reacted to Wednesday
night's sharp rise on Wall Street, writes Joel Kibazo.
In futures, the September contract on the FT-SE 100 opened strongly at 3,246
with dealers trying to maintain the momentum set by New York's overnight
performance. But a big seller within the first hour ended the early euphoria
and sent the contract retreating to 3,235 mid-morning.
This proved to be a brief set-back and good institutional demand helped
September regain lost ground to move sharply ahead over the next few hours.
A squeeze around lunch time sent the contract to the day's peak of 3,264 and
light arbitrage activity was reported at around this time.
September failed to hold above the 3,250 support level when Wall Street
failed to continue Wednesday's strong rally and it closed at 3,243, up a net
18 and just ahead of its fair value premium to cash of about 6 points.
Volume was 11,936 lots.
The strong market trend boosted activity in traded options with most of the
day's activity centred on the index options sector.
Total turnover was 49,054 of which 11,880 was in the FT-SE 100 option and
11,909 contracts in the Euro FT-SE option. British Gas was the busiest stock
option with 3,082 lots dealt.

FT  26 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities slip as bond market
suffers reverse
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
Cyclical stocks gave way to profit-taking yesterday afternoon as the bond
market suffered a sudden reversal, writes Frank McGurty in New York. However
the technology sector showed fresh vigour, bringing modest gains to stocks
traded on the Nasdaq screen-based market.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 16.84 lower at 3,829.89, while the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 receded 0.95 to 468.08 in moderate
NYSE volume of 284m shares. The American SE composite was 0.86 easier at
447.12.
By contrast, the Nasdaq composite closed 3.08 firmer at 754.80, thanks to
its heavy concentration of computer-related stocks.
After the powerful advance staged by the blue chips in the previous
session's final hour, stocks were expected to face at least some
profit-taking as analysts struggled to make sense of a rally which had
caught most equity investors flat-footed.
Wednesday's upturn was linked to a late advance in bonds, though their
improvement was mostly attributable to the success of a Treasury supply
auction, rather than any fundamental developments that carried implications
for stocks.
Yesterday morning bond prices drifted lower, as traders largely ignored a
pair of conflicting second-tier economic reports. The firming trend by the
dollar continued to add support, with the greenback recovering more ground
against the yen and the D-mark. Stocks in turn held steady.
By late afternoon, however, the mood had turned full circle, a development
which was nearly as baffling as the previous session's surge.
Bonds were down sharply amid heavy selling driven by technical factors.
Stocks followed suit, lurching deep into negative ground before recovering
to show moderate losses by the end of the day.
Some of the big cyclical stocks which had led the market forward on
Wednesday fell victim to a concerted pull-back. Caterpillar retreated
Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 111 7/8 and International Paper shed Dollars 1 7/8
to Dollars 73 3/8 .
Among the other Dow components, Kodak shed Dollars 1 to Dollars 49 3/8 .
Coca-Cola failed to benefit from an upgrading by PaineWebber, finishing
unchanged at Dollars 46 1/4 .
IBM ran counter to the trend in cyclicals, advancing Dollars 2 to Dollars 69
3/8 . The gain followed news that Big Blue was slashing prices on many of
its personal computers.
The expectation of a price war in computers had a salutary effect on IBM's
competitors and suppliers. Compaq gained Dollars 2 1/4 to 38 3/8 , while
EMC, a computer hardware manufacturer, advanced Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 17
3/4 . Digital was up Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 24 1/4 after agreeing to sell
its database software business to Oracle.
Semiconductor issues were in demand. Micron Technology gained Dollars 2 3/8
to Dollars 43 1/4 and Texas Instruments Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 81 5/8 .
They were aided by a positive report from Goldman Sachs.
Among the brightest lights on the Nasdaq, Cyrix gained Dollars 1 5/8 to
Dollars 43 1/2 , a new 52-week high for the microchip design concern. Oracle
was Dollars 1 5/8 ahead at Dollars 43 1/4 .
Canada
Toronto stocks ended slightly lower in active trading with the the TSE-300
composite index closing at 4,257.00, down 6.73 points, or 0.16 per cent.
Declines led advances 393 to 365, volume slipped to 61.53m shares from
73.69m, and trading value was CDollars 884.5m compared with Dollars C1.04bn.
Toronto Dominion Bank and National Bank of Canada both reported higher
third-quarter earnings. TD Bank, however, lost  3/8 to 21 7/8 , and National
Bank was unchanged at 9 5/8 .
Argentina
Prices on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange closed moderately higher in brisk
trading.
The Merval Index of leading shares rose 4.80 points or 0.8 per cent to end
at 581.52 while the broad General Index closed 134.47 points, or 0.7 per
cent, higher at 20,640.69.
Molinos was among the biggest gainers, advancing 25 cents to 9.00 pesos.
Heavily-weighted YPF was strong up 25 cents to end at 25.05 pesos.
Brazil
Sao Paulo rallied after two days of profit-taking on confidence that foreign
investment will remain welcome in Brazil.
The Bovespa index gained 1,469 points, or 2.8 per cent, to 53,546.

FT  26 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses respond well to
overnight gains in Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses responded to overnight gains on Wall Street, and lost relatively
little in the afternoon when the Dow improved from early weakness, writes
Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT was led higher by banks, carmakers and the utilities sector as the
Dax index closed 25.84, or 1.2 per cent higher at 2,152.21.
Turnover rose from DM6.9bn to DM7.3bn. Short covering grew to a wave and
Commerzbank, Deutsche and Dresdner rose by DM5.80 to DM328, DM11 to DM712.50
and DM7 to DM405.50 respectively.
In the automotive list, BMW rose DM10 to DM814 and Daimler by DM17.50 to
DM812.50 but Volkwagen, still depressed by the apparently gloomy remarks
about industry prospects from its chairman, Mr Ferdinand Piech, recovered
only DM2.50 on the session. A magazine interview with Mr Piech, raising
hopes of a higher 1994 dividend, took the shares up another DM4.50 to
DM484.50 in the post-bourse.
There was good news on the inflation front, with preliminary data showing
western Germany's consumer price levels in line with market expectations and
the utilities, interest rate sensitive, responded with RWE DM9 better at
DM459, Veba up DM8.20 at DM548 and Viag DM7.40 higher at DM494.70 ahead of
today's half-year results.
In chemicals, Bayer's commendable 24 per cent gain in first half pre-tax
profits left the shares only DM1 higher at DM367. Hoechst, also due to
report today, rose DM6 to DM353.50.
PARIS was said to be fuelled by fresh liquidity arriving with the start of
the September trading account, but bond futures reduced their gains in the
afternoon and the equity market closed off its best with the CAC 40 index
20.23 higher at 2,026.52, after a high of 2,040.53.
Financials had a good day. Banks were even more generally strong than on
Wednesday, Paribas and Suez climbing FFr11.40 to FFr361.30, and FFr7.50 to
FFr268.50,the latter after reports of a big buy order, while Bancaire rose
FFr19.90, or 4.3 per cent to FFr484.90.
In insurers, the soon to be privatised AGF was a leading gainer in the blue
chip category, helped by remarks from its chairman, Mr Antoine
Jeancourt-Galignani, who told a French magazine that the first half numbers
were very favorable, with gains in profitability in every area of activity.
AGF results will be released next Wednesday.
Turnover was relatively weak at FFr2.2bn. Canal Plus, the pay television
group, staged a partial recovery of FFr7 to FFr918 after earlier weakness on
unconfirmed reports that the government will burden the company with hefty
financial obligations when its broadcasting licence is renewed.
AMSTERDAM took heart from some strong company results which lifted the AEX
index by 3.69 points to 417.73 in fairly active trading.
ING's results boosted the financial sector while the insurer's own shares
rose Fl 1.80 to Fl 80.80. Fortis Amev gained Fl 0.90 to Fl 74.70, while
Aegon rose Fl 2.20 to Fl 101.80 and ABN Amro advanced Fl 0.60 to Fl 62.30
ahead of first-half results.
KPN, the telecoms and postal group which turned in better than expected
profits, climbed Fl 1.30 to Fl 53.10. Internatio-Mueller, the transport
group which also produced strong results earlier in the week, added another
Fl 1.80 to Fl 88.20.
Pakhoed continued to suffer from figures below expectations, falling Fl 0.90
to FL 48 after a decline on Wednesday. Brokers expressed disappointment that
the group's European operations did not perform better.
ZURICH firmed on the back of the Dow's overnight spurt but lost momentum in
the afternoon as volume thinned. The SMI index increased 10.0 to 2,551.1,
off its intraday high of 2,563.2.
A mixed tone in US bonds yesterday, and a slightly softer opening on Wall
Steet dampened sentiment in the afternoon.
Alusuisse advanced SFr8 to SFr688 ahead of its interim report next week.
However, MrHans Kaufmann at Bank Julius Baer said that positive first-half
results had probably been factored into the share's price. Other cyclicals
also firmed.
Banks ended mixed, with UBS rising SFr12 to SFr1,109, SBC unchanged at
SFr272 and CS Holding dipping SFr1 to SFr519.
MILAN continued to be influenced strongly by today's cabinet meeting which
is expected to give a much-awaited indication of the government's budget
plans. The market was looking for tough measures, particularly on pensions.
Investors stayed on the sidelines and in thin trading the Comit index
declined by 3.60 to 684.72. There was also seen to be continued technical
resistance at 690.
Olivetti was the one hot spot in a generally rudderless market. Traders were
mulling the possible effects of Digital Equipment's sale of its remaining
stake in the Italian company, a move which was confirmed on Wednesday.
Olivetti's shares fell L65 to L2,290 as rumours circulated that the sale had
made been at a low price.
Fiat also came in for some attention and its shares fell L70 to L6,485,
which dampened the market further.
Insurers also fell back after Wednesday's gains but were favoured on the
belief that they will benefit from budget changes.
DUBLIN rose by just short of 2 per cent, the ISEQ general index closing
35.54 higher at 1,859.75 on strength in financials and Jefferson Smurfit,
which closed 25p higher at 420p. Dealers said that the market had slipped
back recently on stories of a major upcoming cash call from Smurfit, but had
recovered on the feeling that it had become oversold, on strong gains in the
US and UK markets, and on strength in the US paper sector on Wednesday.
WARSAW continued to fall as profit-taking continued but there were signs
that buying pressure was building up to the point where it could produce a
rebound next week. The Wig index dropped 513.0, or 4.2 per cent to 11,458.2
as volume rose by 29 per cent to 1.8m shares.

FT  26 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Gold underpins S Africa
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
South African equities finished mostly firmer but off highs as profit-taking
pared early gains. A stronger Wall Street and better gold price underpinned
the market and brokers said they expected shares to firm again today in
follow-through support from outstanding orders.
The overall index added 19 to 5,916, after earlier hitting an all-time high
at 5,937, industrials rose 12 to 6,662 and gold 11 to 2,295.
Traders said investors shrugged off bond market nervousness and took in
their stride Reserve Bank governor Mr Chris Stals' warning that monetary
policy could be tightened.
Anglos ended down 175 cents at R261.50 after shedding earlier gains, and De
Beers dropped 25 cents to R109.
Among gold shares, Vaal Reefs added R5 to R424 while Kloof shed 50 cents to
R67.

FT  26 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Region rises on Wall
Street as Nikkei moves down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Profit-taking by domestic institutions and arbitrage selling in the
afternoon left the Nikkei index lower after the morning's gains. This was in
spite of a fall in the yen against the dollar, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The 225 average fell 68.31 to end at the day's low of 20,443.29. It reached
a high of 20,603.62 in the morning but soon declined as the sellers moved
in. Volume totalled 247m shares, up from 273m.
Overseas investors were attracted by steels and chemicals, but sold electric
utilities and non-life insurance companies.
The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 4.93 to 1,633.77 while the
Nikkei 300 fell 1.07 to 297.28. Declines led advances by 522 to 440 with 208
unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.24 to 1,327.31.
Domestic institutions took profits on their holdings as the index hit the
day's high to boost their valuations ahead of the interim book closing at
the end of September. Traders said individual investors, meanwhile, were
trying to raise cash ahead of the forthcoming offerings for Japan Tobacco
and Japan Telecom.
The auction for Japan Telecom yesterday drew an average weighted average
price of Y5.44m, with bids totalling 78,801, against the 17,000 shares
involved.
DDI, the telecom operator on the second section, closed down Y1,000 to
Y981,000. The stock had been sold earlier this week as investors raised
funds for the Japan Telecom auction. Other telecom linked shares were
stronger.
Semi-privatised companies gained ground. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose
Y2,000 to Y864,000 and East Japan Railway added Y1,000 to Y520,000.
Steelmakers were lower, again on profit taking, with Sumitomo Metal
Industries losing Y8 to Y330.
Minebea, the ball bearings company facing financial problems due to its
diversification projects in the late 1980s, fell Y30 to Y805 on reports of a
press conference. After the market closed, the company said it would sell
its consumer finance companies to GE Capital, the finance arm of the US
group.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 11.57 to 22,821.88 in volume of 90.2m shares.
Volume rose on trading by corporate investors realising profits ahead of the
September book closing.
Roundup
Sharp overnight gains on Wall Street fuelled a firmer trend in most of the
region while local concerns nudged the Bombay and Bangkok bourses lower.
HONG KONG rode up on the back of the Dow's, the Hang Seng index closing
97.42 higher at 9,336.11. Selective bargain hunting by domestic investors
provided an extra boost.
Brokers said that expectations of relatively weak results for Cheung Kong -
announced after the market close - had already been reflected in a recent
fall in its share price. The stock advanced 80 cents to HKDollars 36, having
slipped by 9.7 per cent by Wednesday from its most recent peak on August 1.
The Hang Seng index fell 4.6 per cent in the same period.
Interest in Cheung Kong bolstered other property issues, with SHK Properties
rising HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 51.75 and Henderson Land adding 70 cents to
HKDollars 40.60.
Cheung Kong's affiliate, Hutchison, which announced a better than expected
rise in first half net profit after the close, gained 30 cents to HKDollars
35.50. Among other blue chips, HSBC gained 50 cents to HKDollars 88 and Hang
Seng Bank increased HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 52.75.
SYDNEY also took its cue from a stronger Wall Street while a firmer
resources sector did the rest. The All Ordinaries index finished 16.7 higher
at 2,077.8, but was off its session peak of 2,088.7.
Traders said that the continuing rise in commodity prices was lending
underlying support to the market with offshore investors attracted to
Australian metal miners.
Key resources stocks like Western Mining, CRA and MIM led the resources
sector higher.
News Corp, the day's most active stock, fell 15 cents to ADollars 9.
WELLINGTON held its morning gains, closing firmer after a day of solid,
rather than spectacular trade with the NZSE-40 index up 16.28 at 2,118.99.
Volume was solid at NZDollars 77m, but swelled by a crossing of 5.5m Fernz
shares which amounted to Dollars 35m. Fernz ended 10 cents higher at Dollars
6.50.
The leaders were mixed, with Telecom posting a nine cent gain to Dollars
5.06 and Brierley easing two to NZDollars 1.32.
BANGKOK slid on heavy selling in the finance sector, led by Finance One on
news of a big rights issue. The SET index dropped 29.86, or 2 per cent to
1,444.72, but was off its low of 1,425.59. Turnover was Bt22.57bn.
Finance One, which resumed trading after a week-long suspension, fell Bt44
to Bt492 after announcing that it planned to raise its capital to Bt5.4bn
from Bt1.64bn.
Among other finance stocks, Dhana Siam plunged Bt44 to Bt752 and Prime
Finance fell Bt11 to Bt169.
MANILA lost steam after a strong start but closed marginally higher, again
reflecting Wall Street's gains. The composite index strengthened 2.95 to at
3,127.06.
JAKARTA share prices closed higher in active trading with foreign and local
investor sentiment bullish. The official index advanced 2.11 to 489.54 and
brokers said it looked set to break through the 500-point mark.
BOMBAY edged lower in a session dulled by the end of account and concerns
about the assassination of a Hindu local party chief in Bombay. The BSE
30-share index closed at a provisional 4,414.85, down 14.20 points.
COLOMBO closed higher in thin trading dominated by retailers and foreign
institutions, the CSE all-share index closing 12.24 higher at 1,000.77.
Turnover was low at Rs79.6m compared with Rs121.9m on Wednesday.
TAIPEI reversed early gains to end lower on late profit-taking; brokers said
a downside consolidation would continue in coming sessions.
The weighted index, which hit an intraday high of 6,945.08, slipped 4.13 to
end at 6,858.01. Turnover declined to TDollars 90bn from TDollars 100.3bn on
Wednesday.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Focus on CBI survey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Swedish krona and the Danish krone were yesterday the most active
currencies in an otherwise quiet day on the foreign exchanges, writes Philip
Gawith.
Markets have struggled to develop direction or momentum in the absence of
any important data releases. In the UK, at least, this should change today
with the release of the CBI's monthly trends survey. The price expectations
figure will be closely watched, for a hint of the likely outlook for UK
interest rates.
In Scandinavia, markets are increasingly influenced by political factors,
with Sweden facing a general election on September 18, and the date for a
Danish election undecided.
The Swedish krona finished at SKr4.933 against the D-Mark, from a close on
Wednesday of SKr4.952. Earlier it had fallen to a low of SKr4.9730 on
rumours of a downgrading of Swedish debt.
The Danish krone closed at DKr3.965, from DKr3.967, after earlier weakening
to SKr3.9790.
The dollar was firmer against the yen, helped by support from the Bank of
Japan. It finished at Y99.735 from Y98.415. Against the D-Mark it rose half
a pfennig to DM1.5462 from DM1.5411.
Sterling had a quiet day, finishing slightly down against the firmer dollar,
at Dollars 1.5526 from Dollars 1.5558. Against the D-Mark it closed at
DM2.4005 from DM2.3977.
The gyrations in the Danish krone appeared to owe more to concerns about the
timing of the forthcoming election, than to Wednesday's details of the draft
1995 budget. A rumour doing the rounds suggested that the government might
be planning a snap election in September, rather than waiting until
November, as had generally been assumed.
Mr Jouni Kokko, international economist at SG Warburg in London, said the
budget itself 'had been very much a non-event.' Much of the detail had been
leaked in advance, the key feature being a moderate tightening of fiscal
policy. Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, the central bank president, yesterday welcomed
it, saying it was a continuation of the government's 'cautious approach'.
Mr Kokko said the market did not have too much to be concerned about, with
the choice between what is already a good government, and one that might be
more credible. 'If there is a policy consensus anywhere in Europe, it must
be in Denmark,' he said.
The catalyst for weakness in Sweden was a repeat of the recent concern that
Swedish debt might be downgraded.
Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at the Bank of American in London, said
the Scandinavian currencies were trading fairly firmly. 'However, at these
sorts of levels they still offer an opportunity to go out and buy D-Marks,
given that there is so much uncertainty ahead.'
Analysts said the firmer tone to the dollar indicated optimism that a
breakthrough would be achieved in US-Japan trade talks by the end of
September deadline.
Dollar bulls also took comfort from the comments of Mr Fred Bergsten, the
influential US economist, who said the yen had 'fundamentally peaked' around
current levels.
Japanese officials, however, were more cautious, with a senior official at
the Ministry of Trade and Industry in Tokyo saying that he was 'not
optimistic' about an early trade deal with the US.
Mr Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in New York
takes a similar line. Noting that the US trade gap had widened, relative to
a year previously, in all but one of the last 28 months, he commented: 'As
long as the US trade balance remains unbalanced, it will take substantial
capital flows - generated by substantial interest rate differentials and
strong bond returns - to finance that gap. Thus the dollar needs bigger
marginal changes than the Fed induced last week to hold it up.'
The short sterling market had another quiet day, but the release of the CBI
survey will give it more to chew on. In his meeting with the chancellor on
July 6, Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, noted that 'the
CBI price expectations balance had in the past been a good leading indicator
of producer prices.'
Another high balance - following on plus 12 in June and July - would
increase expectations of a near term rise in base rates. Mr Hawkins of Bank
of America said the expectation of higher rates tended to help sterling.
Should the market decide, however, that the Bank is 'behind the game' in
fighting inflation, it may sell the currency.
The Bank of England provided late assistance of Pounds 270m to UK money
markets. It did not operate in the morning and afternoon rounds, after
forecasting a Pounds 300m shortage. Overnight money traded between 4 and 5
3/4 per cent.
In Germany, traders said call money was being bid down aggressively, with
most trade occurring at 4.8 per cent, below the 4.85 per cent repo rate.
The market was unsure whether West German inflation data - prices rose by 3
per cent, year-on-year to August - helped or hindered the case for lower
rates.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fishmeal plants gobble up
Peru's marine wealth - The crisis threatened by overcapacity and
inefficiency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peru's fishmeal industry, already the world's number one exporter in 1993,
is set for even more spectacular figures this year. The catch in the first
six months was almost half as large again as last year's and, with new
plants coming on stream along the coast, quality is on the increase as well
as quantity.
'It's an extraordinary year for fishing,' says Mr Dante Matellini, the
retired admiral who presides over Pescaperu, the world's largest fishmeal
producer. Pescaperu was created in the early 1970s when the then left-wing
military government nationalised the bulk of the privately-owned plants.
With favourable climatic conditions and fish stocks fully recovered after
the 1991-92 ravages of the warm current known as 'El Nino' (The Child), Mr
Matellini has more to keep him busy than simply producing and selling
fishmeal. He is also charged with the privatisation of the state's assets:
some 20 fishmeal factories and four fishoil refineries.
Pescaperu's sale was originally announced almost two years ago. Now new
chief, Mr Matellini, has redrawn the strategy to sell the plants as
separate, legally-constituted companies rather than as simple assets. The
plants are valued at between Dollars 5m and Dollars 10m apiece, but all
require substantial investment and upgrading.
Privatisation has proved delicate as well as slow. Workers made redundant
under a rationalisation scheme have demonstrated vociferously in Lima's
streets. Now the fishing lobby, the SNP, is also objecting to the sale.
'Pescaperu is a seven-headed dragon,' says Mr Lucas de Tramontana, the SNP's
vice-president and a major shareholder in Pesquera Austral, the second
largest private fishmeal producer. 'We believe not more than half-a-dozen of
its plants should be sold.' An official proposal to that effect has been put
before the privatisers.
The SNP's objection is that Peru's existing plant capacity vastly exceeds
the fish available for processing. In a 'normal' year, hundreds of small
Peruvian fishermen land about 6.5m tonnes of 'industrial' fish, primarily
anchovy and sardine, caught within 30 miles of the shore by traditional,
low-tech methods.
Last year, more than 8.4m tonnes of fish were extracted and, by the time the
twice-yearly fishing ban came into force on 1 August, that total had already
been matched. But, working at capacity, Peru's hungry processing plants can
gobble up around 20,000 tonnes of raw fish an hour.
By early July, Pescaperu had exported 450,000 tonnes of fishmeal, worth
Dollars 144m - about a third of the 1994 national total so far. Each year,
however, its share dwindles as private producers bring new, high-technology
plants on stream to turn out 'special' quality fishmeal.
One such is the Dollars 22m installation belonging to Sindicato Pesquero
(Sipesa), near the port of Matarani on Peru's southern coast, where fish
stocks are now proving more reliable. Sipesa is far and away the country's
leading private company, with 1993 exports worth Dollars 75m. This year's
shipments could be 50 per cent higher.
Pesquera Austral, in the number two slot and investing heavily, has recently
brought two new special quality plants on line, both south of Lima. It has
launched a Dollars 30m Euronote issue to help finance restructuring and
expansion.
In all, the SNP's general manager, Mr Richard Diaz, can reckon up some
Dollars 400m in fresh private sector investments planned and already under
way for fleet and plant modernisation.
But, with all the entrepreneurial activity, Peru's anchovy and sardine
stocks are being stretched to their limits - some suspect they may already
be over-fished. The last time Peruvian fishermen caught quantities similar
to this year's was in record-breaking 1971. That free-for-all decimated
stocks and plunged the fishmeal industry into crisis for years.
The UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation is working with Peru's fisheries
ministry and maritime institute (Imarpe) to make a better evaluation of the
resource. Mr Diaz says 'preliminary information from the study indicates
there may have been errors in calculating the biomass in previous years. Or
else the 'biological' fishing ban has allowed stocks to build up.'
Nevertheless, the anchovy and sardine caught off the Peruvian coast are
finite. Apart from improving the conversion ratio of raw material to
finished product, fishmeal producers may soon have no alternative but to
move into deeper waters where virtually untapped stocks of horse and jack
mackerel abound.
Investment in deep-sea trawlers, of course, is expensive and, according to
the SNP, Peru's very private fishing sector (no Peruvian fishing company is
yet publicly traded) carries a heavy burden of debt.
One option for the forward-looking company is a joint venture backed by
foreign capital. Peru's Sotomayor group, 40 per cent owned by American
Proteins of Atlanta, has embarked on a tuna-fishing venture in association
with JIDO, the Japanese investment and development organisation. The first
of a projected four-ship fleet is already operating off the Peruvian coast
and selling tuna to Japan for sashimi.
A Dutch company, Van der Zwan, meanwhile, has bought back seven Dutch-built
trawlers originally supplied to now-liquidated Flopesca, the former
state-owned high seas fishing fleet. In a joint venture with a local company
based in Peru's northern port of Paita, a couple of the reconditioned
trawlers are to produce frozen fish, mainly hake, for export to Europe.
A further, obvious option for Peruvian companies that see the writing on the
wall is to launch a public share offering. Both Sipesa and Sotomayor say
they are considering it.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Palm oil prices at highest
since 1984
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Export prices for Malaysian palm oil have hit the highest levels for more
than 10 years and traders are forecasting further gains as world demand
increases.
This week the export price for immediate delivery of Malaysia's crude palm
oil reached MDollars 1,402 (Pounds 354) a tonne - the first time since 1984
that prices had breached the MDollars 1,400 mark.
'Rising demand, particularly from China and Pakistan, plus lower Malaysian
production this year is likely to push prices up still higher,' said a
Singapore-based commodities trader.
Malaysia is the world's biggest producer of palm oil, accounting for about
55 per cent of total global output.
Mr Lim Keng Yaik, the country's minister of primary industries, said that
Malaysia's palm oil output this year was likely to be lower than the 7.4m
tonnes produced in 1993 because the local crop was 'over-stressed' after two
years of good yields.
Its palm oil stocks have been steadily declining in recent months: according
to latest statistics from the palm oil registration and licensing authority,
stocks at the end of July were 451,500 tonnes, a 4 per cent drop on the
previous month's figure.
Meanwhile Malaysia's palm oil producers have stepped up pressure on the
government to take action to alleviate severe labour shortages in the
plantation sector.
Plantation owners say that more should be done to ensure that foreign
workers stay on the plantations and not move after a few months to factory
jobs in urban areas. Many palm oil and rubber estates in Malaysia are more
than 60 per cent staffed by immigrant workers.

FT  26 AUG 94 / World Commodities Prices: Zinc is main LME bright spot as
others consolidate - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ZINC was the strongest of the London Metal Exchange contracts yesterday as
prices responded to good fourth quarter consumption prospects and the fact
that tight supplies of concentrate (an intermediate material) would induce a
natural control over production levels in the not too distant future.
Trade and speculative buying, coupled with short-covering, prompted an early
rise to Dollars 1,000 a tonne for three months delivery, a level last seen
five weeks ago. Profit-taking appeared at that level and the price fell back
to Dollars 995.
But the buyers were quickly back in the driving seat and by the end of after
hours (kerb) trading it was quoted at Dollars 1,002 a tonne, up Dollars 14
from Wednesday.
Most other LME markets attempted to consolidate gains made earlier in the
week. Following Wednesday's Dollars 32 rise, three months COPPER retested
resistance around Dollars 2,420 a tonne before slipping back to Dollars
2,411. But it ended the kerb at Dollars 2,416, up Dollars 1.
Traders suggested that it might not be until after the UK's long holiday
weekend that a further serious attempt would be made on resistance around
Dollars 2,430.
Three months positions for LEAD and NICKEL met effective resistance at
Dollars 600 and Dollars 6,020 a tonne respectively. Last business in lead
was at Dollars 595, down Dollars 4 a tonne from Wednesday, while nickel
touched Dollars 6,050 before ending the day at Dollars 5,990, up Dollars 65
a tonne.
ALUMINIUM succumbed to some trade selling and profit-taking after
Wednesday's strong performance and the three months prices fell back to
Dollars 1,512 a tonne before ending at Dollars 1,513, down Dollars 11.
At the London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures ended down but well off lows
as industry and trade buying supported a thin market pressured by tight
supplies and threats of further damage to Brazilian crops resulting from the
continuing dry weather in growing regions, dealers said.
The November futures position closed at Dollars 3,553 a tonne, down Dollars
20 on the day, after a steeper downturn had been stemmed by considerable
industry buying, according to one trader. 'It should have gone down much
more - in a range of Dollars 60 to Dollars 70 (lower) - based on New York's
close,' he said.
Dealers also said lower production estimates for Brazil made by German
commodity statistics agency FO Licht had supported the market, which was
generally pulled down by trade liquidation and profit-taking following the
strong rises of Monday and Tuesday.
In its report Licht said it had cut its 1995-96 Brazilian crop estimate by
8.5m bags (60kg each) to 18m and attributed the drop, in part, to the recent
Brazilian frosts.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: World wheat forecast cut by 8m
tonnes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY and NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The International Wheat Council has reduced its estimates for 1994-95 world
wheat production and, to a lesser extent, consumption.
In its latest Grain Market Report the London-based IWC blames reduced crop
expectations for Russia, Canada, Pakistan, Turkey and Australia for the
8m-tonne cut, compared with its projection a month ago, in the production
figure. This is now put at 536m tonnes, 23m below the 1993-94 total. Its
consumption estimate has been cut by 3m to 554m tonnes.
As a result of persistent hot, dry weather in July Russia is now expected to
produce 37m tonnes, 1m less than indicated in the July report.
The Candian forecast, down 800,000 tonnes from last month at 23.8m, is now
4m tonnes below the 1993-94 outturn. The IWC attributes this to a drop in
spring sowings as growers switched to more profitable crops like canola
(oilseed rape) and soyabeans.
With drought conditions persisting in the eastern states of Australia
another 2m tonnes has been trimmed from that countries estimate, taking it
to 12m tonnes, 33 per cent below last season's output.
Senator Bob Collins, Australia's primary industry minster, is still more
pessimistic, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney.
He told the federal parliament yesterday that the country's national wheat
harvest was likely to be little more than 11m tonnes in 1994-95 as a result
of the severe drought conditions in parts of Queensland and New South Wales.
The minister said that the most recent updates suggested that the NSW crop
would be about 20 per cent of the previous year's production - 'about a
million tonnes instead of 5m last year'. In 1993-94 Australia produced
almost 18m tonnes of wheat and this formed the country's seventh largest
export category.
The only encouraging feature that Senator Collins could point to was some
helpful late rains in Western Australia, one of the major wheat-growing
states. 'It looks as if there'll be a reasonable crop from WA,' he said.
The drought conditions are relatively recent in NSW, but have persisted for
four years in Queensland, causing major problems for the farm sector.

Wool sold at higher prices this week wherever auctions were held. In
Australia the Eastern States market indicator closed 22 cents higher than a
week ago at 728 cents a kg. Prices paid for finer merinos wore again rising
more quickly than other categories but the rise was nevertheless general and
definite. South African wool at the first auction of the season there sold
at prices 6% tp 12% higher than at the last sale in June, and there was a
complete clearance. New Zealand crossbred wool was dearer on the week in the
2.5% to 5% range, and British wool at Wednesday's Bradford auction met with
strong demand at prices 7.5% to 12.5% higher than at the comparable sale on
July 27. Rising prices in recent weeks have brought out more business and
some of it is well forward.

The IWA-Canada union, representing British Columbia's wood workers, has
demanded pay increases totalling 18 per cent over the next three years.
The employers' group, Forest Industrial Relations, immediately dismissed the
demand as 'out of line' and far from reflecting recent pay settlements
generally in Canada.
The union, which last week won a strike mandate from its members, said the
industry was making large profits and could afford a good increase.
'Its a stand-off and we're not sure we'll amend our position,' said Mr Gerry
Stoney, IWA-Canada president. No negotiations are scheduled yet.

FT  26 AUG 94 / People: Builder's charter - The costliest mistakes occur at
the design stage - not on site
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART LIPTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's Millennium Fund offers an opportunity to reverse the history of
public building catastrophes. The Fund, which will use money raised from the
country's national lottery to finance 'celebratory' capital projects, could
also mark a turning point in British architecture and construction - if
architects were allowed to participate with enlightened clients and produce
practical and cost-effective buildings.
How do some projects valued at Pounds 90m with a completion time of 24
months end up costing twice as much and taking twice as long to finish? A
lack of knowledge by the lay client has encouraged poor cost-control and lax
competition times. But the supply industry must share some of the blame.
Professionals continue to be appointed in the wrong sequence, and are not
given parity in their contracts - and gaps between contracts become a cost
to the client. All contracts should be administered as part of a seamless
process. Selection of the team with clear, long-established relationships
between members is a prerequisite for success.
What frequently happens is that each professional adds his embellishment at
successive pre-construction stages. These layers of 'improvements' must be
paid for and the client may be presented with costs for unwanted changes.
The UK construction system generally divides into different departments the
tasks of cost planning, project planning procurement, site management and
commissioning, with the overall team leader far removed from
decision-making. More effective would be a contractor controlling a small
staff with the technical back-up and solutions which are based on the
current brief rather than overcoming earlier failures.
Spending more money does not ensure a better result. Developments in the
commercial office world have proved that cost does not equal quality. What
must be avoided is fashion-engineering where the patron is the guinea pig in
the architect/builder's laboratory. A contractor's flair for cost-cutting
must be counter-balanced by a robust design to protect the clients'
interests and the architectural integrity.
Design competitions produce stimulating new ideas, but the risk of every
task of the project being subject to competition is such that it can prevent
a collaborative approach between the architect, the team, the craftsmen and
the client.
Design-and-build and other supposed cost short-cuts allow the client to pass
responsibility to the builder who then designs to a price not a quality.
Construction is a difficult task, but should be a matter of logic and
quality control. But construction and design must not be separated. Most
clients find the building process a mystery and yet they foot the bill and
carry a subordinate role in the management of the process. Such difficulties
typically cost the client 30 per cent more than he should pay.
All large, new projects should have patronage as well as a client. A patron
must be the decision-maker, the budget-holder and must have the final
decision on the project brief.
The value of this role was demonstrated in the rebuilding of Glyndebourne
Opera House, which was completed on time, on cost and with just one closed
season. Sir George Christie, chairman of Glyndebourne, was the patron.
Glyndebourne Productions performed the role of client, representing the
different interests of finance, artistic, musical direction, props, wardrobe
and so on. Such an arrangement is equally applicable to a gallery, a library
or a bridge.
Good clients have a fine understanding of their own needs, and respect
professional disciplines. Likewise, many clients think they are unique in
their property needs and yet when they build their one building - often
their most complex undertaking - they put insufficient time and effort into
pre-contract analysis.
Although not as technologically advanced as, say, building an aircraft, the
design and construction of property requires sophisticated management
techniques, the application of ingenious engineering solutions and
logistical exercises. Yet the average building still uses 1960s technology.
Roofs still leak; contract periods are not met and cost over-runs can
embarrass the client.
In spite of its dismal record the industry has made progress in the past
decade in overcoming these problems, with co-operation from trade unions,
research and development by contractors, and new contract procedures, all
with assistance of a new breed of architects.
So can the needs of clients commissioning buildings under the Millennium
Fund be translated into buildings of high quality? And can this be achieved
for a price which represents good value?
The construction process of any building need not be complex. It relies on a
clear vision and a well-researched brief. Visits abroad to see comparable
buildings are much less expensive than experimenting at home during
construction. The costliest mistakes occur on the drawing broad - not on the
construction site. Rectifying mistakes can cost 15 per cent of total
budgets.
The procurement of construction is shrouded in mystery. Good factual
'bench-mark' information on construction performance, for example, is
difficult to find or jealously guarded.
We all tend only to see the end-product - the building. Yet excellence in
this end-result can only be achieved by excellence in the complex process by
which it is achieved.
Both in UK and continental Europe, there now exist architects of
extraordinary talent. They must be awarded contracts based on design skills
rather than lowest fees. Their knowledge will contribute to efficient
construction, design excellence and innovation, all leading to better cost
control.
In the UK, once the professional team is signed up, the architect and
contractor end up in pivotal positions. Consequently the project tends to be
design- or construction-led, with the 'client' taking a subordinate role.
But design and construction are just two stages in a building project. For
the project to succeed, the design process needs a clearly defined target
backed by a collaborative team approach.
Quality is not an optional extra - whatever the budget. The lead must come
from a committed client. This requires an integrated approach by an
experienced client, able to add value to the procurement process: first by
identifying what represents quality and value; and second, by ensuring the
realisation of that value. This approach rests on a belief and a need to
control the risks of procurement, coupled with the task of sustaining an
overall vision. Only then will we get buildings worthy of the millennium
celebrations.

<TEXT>
The search is on for a new chairman of the Forestry Commission to take over
from Sir Raymond Johnstone (right), the former chieftain of the Murray
Johnstone fund management group, who has been looking after Britain's
forests for the past five years.
Sir Raymond, 64, leaves at the end of the month when his term of office
expires. It is understood that he would have been prepared to continue as
part-time chairman for a few more years.
However, the government appears to have decided that it wants a fresh face
to push through the recently published recommendations of its task force's
review of the Forestry Commission's estate.
When Sir Raymond was first appointed there was a suspicion that he had been
brought in to oversee the privatisation of the commission, given that much
of his earlier career had been spent bringing companies to the stock market.
That was not part of Sir Raymond's original brief, though, and he quickly
decided for himself that privatisation was not appropriate. His view was
endorsed last month when the government shelved plans to privatise the
commission.
Sir Raymond has been involved in giving the commission a 'greener image' and
a more efficient organisation structure.
He oversaw the 1992 reorganisation which separated the commission's
departmental, regulatory and management functions and has been heavily
involved in improving the commission's relationships with the public and
environmental groups.
However, there has been a worry in some quarters of the forestry industry
that Sir Raymond might have gone 'too green'. There has been a sharp drop in

FT  26 AUG 94 / People: MGN creates pensions post
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A rare shaft of light in the murkiness that has been the story of Mirror
Group pension funds since Robert Maxwell's death came yesterday with the
news that MGN has created a new post of pensions chief executive.
The first incumbent is Iain Urquhart, 44, formerly benefit administration
group manager with Towers Perrin, the management consultants.
Urquhart's role will be to help and advise the MGN board and to deal with
the pension fund trustees in untangling what he refers to only as 'the
outstanding issues' since Maxwell's death. He will administer the group
pension schemes and its pension policy.
Although not an actuary, he has long experience of pensions, having worked
on the corporate side of a variety of occupational pension schemes since
1976. He readily admits that having been in the post only since Monday, he
does not yet have the measure of the task and does not feel able to say when
MGN might shake off the shadow of Maxwell.
And why did he want to take what seems a demanding and in some ways
unappealing job? 'It was advertised in one of the pensions magazines, and it
sounded like a challenge,' he says.

Laurie Slade has been promoted to become insurance ombudsman after the
controversial resignation of Julian Farrand earlier this month.
Farrand, who is to become pensions ombudsman later this year, said he was
disillusioned over the future of the office. The establishment of the
Personal Investment Authority, the new watchdog set up to protect the
private investor, was undermining the ombudsman's position, he said.
Slade, 50, who has been Farrand's deputy for the past six years, is a
barrister and a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators. Yesterday
he appeared to have accepted the diminishing role of the Insurance
Ombudsman's office: 'We have to effect an orderly transition to the PIA
ombudsman of investment complaints against insurers and fulfil whatever
residual role remains for us in this field.'
Bryan Austin, 59, who retired last year from WH Smith, has been appointed a
member of the Gaming Board.
Austin, whose term runs for two years from September 1994, takes over from
Michael Hogan, a former secretary of the Gaming Board who joined the
five-strong board in March 1986. Austin was employed by WH Smith from 1971
until his retirement in 1993 and held the post of group director, business
planning and development from 1988 to 1993. He was previously employed by
United Biscuits, Dorland Advertising and Atwood Statistics.
The Home Secretary makes all appointments to the Gaming Board, which was
established by the Gaming Act 1968 with two functions, namely to keep under
review the extent, character and location of gaming facilities in Great
Britain and to regulate the conduct of casinos and other establishments
where gaming takes place. It is chaired by Lady Littler.

With an eye to the day when there is no longer any British Coal Corporation,
British Coal chairman Neil Clarke, 60, is adding to his portfolio of
non-executive directorships. He has joined the board of PORVAIR, a small
firm which manufactures materials with microporous structures and has a
market capitalisation of just under Pounds 50m.
Clarke, who has been British Coal chairman since 1991, was formerly chief
executive of Charter Consolidated. He is currently a director of Travis
Perkins and chairman of Genchem Holdings.
As part of the privatisation of British Coal, the government has set up the
Coal Authority which will take over British Coal's ownership of the nation's
coal reserves and be responsible for licensing coal-mining operations.
Sir David White, 64, chairman of Mansfield Brewery and a former part-time
member of British Coal's board, has been appointed chairman-designate of the
new authority which will eventually take over most of British Coal's
responsibilities.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Government Bonds: Bunds take inflation data in their stride
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The German government bond market took the widely-expected rise in August
inflation to a year-on-year rate of 3 per cent in its stride. Higher oil
prices are believed to have caused the rise.
'The market was prepared for 3 per cent . . . but the rise does not change
the view that German inflation is still falling, albeit more slowly than
before,' said Ms Wendy Niffikeer, senior economist at IBJ International. She
noted that in the cash market, 10-year yields dropped from 7.28 per cent at
the opening to 7.23 per cent in the late afternoon.
The market was also supported by comments from Mr Guntram Palm, a member of
the Bundesbank's governing board, that the central bank was not unduly
worried by the acceleration in inflation and that domestic factors spoke for
a further reduction in inflation. These comments were interpreted by some
dealers as suggesting that one more discount rate cut was possible after
all.
On Liffe, the September bund future was stuck in a narrow 28-basis point
trading range. In late trading it stood 0.26 point higher at 91.63 in
moderate trading.
UK gilts continued their steady climb, reflecting the ever-stronger view
among analysts that the market's favourable fundamentals would result in
further gains over the coming months. Gilts were also supported by the
numerous leaks from the Confederation of British Industry's monthly trends
inquiry for August which is due to be published today. On Liffe, the long
gilt future rose  3/4 point to 101 19/32 in the late afternoon.
Yesterday's publication of the weekly notes in circulation were also seen as
positive for the market. Mr Simon Briscoe at SG Warburg said the rise of 6.2
per cent in the week to August 24 meant that he would be looking for MO to
rise by just 0.3 per cent in August. This would bring the annualised
three-month rate down below 6 per cent which compared with 8 per cent in
May.
The Bank of England took advantage of the recent healthy demand for
index-linked gilts by offering Pounds 250m of index-linked Treasury stock
for sale. By contrast, dealers said the vast proportion of the Pounds 500m
worth of conventional stock on offer was still unsold because its price was
thought to be around one point too high for the market.
US Treasury bonds yesterday afternoon gave back all of the gains struck in
Wednesday's big rally.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 15/16 at
99 17/32 , with the yield rising to 7.533 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was down  3/32 at 100, to yield 6.233 per cent.
A mild downturn was not unexpected at the opening, in view of the surprising
strength shown by bonds the previous session. True to form, prices eroded
during the morning amid a round of light profit-taking. Still, the
optimistic tone which had infused the market on Wednesday showed no signs of
dissipating.
The mood turned by the afternoon. Prices began dropping soon after midday in
activity led by the futures market. An expected wave of follow-through
buying from retail accounts, which had come off the sidelines to participate
in Wednesday's successful five-year note auction, never materialised.
As a result, bonds, especially on the long end of the yield curve, were
showing big losses as the session was drawing to a close.
The sudden reversal was nearly as big a surprise as the rally had been.

FT  26 AUG 94 / International Company News: GE Capital plans to buy Japanese
credit business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GE Capital, the finance arm of the US electronics group, is planning a move
into the Japanese consumer finance market through the purchase of a consumer
credit business from Minebea, the ball bearings company burdened by
over-expansion during the late 1980s.
Mr Taketo Yamakawa, managing director of GE Capital's Japanese affiliate,
said the company had been studying ways to enter the Japanese market for
more than a year. Last May, it had started talks with Minebea, which had
been looking for buyers for Minebea Credit, its consumer credit subsidiary
with outstanding loans of Y180bn (Dollars 1.8bn).
GE Capital will buy Minebea Credit's consumer loan credits of Y120bn, while
the credit company will retain its Y60bn mortgage finance business. GE plans
to build its Japanese operations around the consumer credit business, which
is growing sharply due to the need for cash among consumers because of the
prolonged recession and falling earnings. Earlier this year, Ford, the US
carmaker, became the first foreign company to set up a consumer credit
business in Japan.
While the purchasing price for the consumer credit business has not been
disclosed, the agreement has come as a relief for Minebea. The company was
forced to post a special loss of Y18bn last March due to the equity infusion
to the consumer credit affiliate. The parent company also provided loan
guarantees to maintain the affiliate's cash flow squeezed by the sharp fall
in the land collateral value backing its property-linked loans.
Minebea still owns around 70 companies, which it acquired or set up during
the 1980s. However, the aggressive diversification has become an increasing
burden, and last year, the ball bearings company was forced to sell NMB
Semiconductor, its lossmaking semiconductor affiliate to Nippon Steel, the
leading steel manufacturer.

FT  26 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Piper Jaffray-run funds may
have lost Dollars 700m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A group of investment funds and private investor accounts run by a money
manager at Minneapolis-based brokerage Piper Jaffray may have lost as much
as Dollars 700m this year because of derivatives-related losses, the firm
has admitted.
The losses are said to have been incurred primarily on mortgage-backed
securities which the manager, Mr Worth Bruntjen, had bought for a group of
bond funds and privately managed accounts. The value of the assets managed
by Mr Bruntjen stood at Dollars 3.5bn at the end of 1993, but by the end of
June this year the value had plunged to Dollars 2.79bn. Piper Jaffray has
said that the decline was almost entirely due to market losses, rather than
withdrawals by investors.
Although Piper Jaffray has made a Dollars 10m investment in one of the
affected funds as a display of confidence, the firm is under pressure to
provide further financial support to the funds and accounts managed by Mr
Bruntjen. It also faces legal action over the losses.
The problems at the Piper Jaffray-managed funds and accounts are just the
latest example of how professional investment managers and corporations in
the US have been hit hard this year because their derivatives holdings have
exaggerated the negative impact on securities prices of sharply rising
interest rates.
Among those plagued by derivatives-related losses recently have been the
Wall Street securities firm PaineWebber, BankAmerica, and the consumer
products group Procter &amp; Gamble.

Singapore Press Holdings, the island republic's largest publishing group,
has raised close to USDollars 200m through the private placement of foreign
shares with institutional investors.
The 11m new shares, which account for about 4 per cent of the company's
share capital, were priced at SDollars 26 each. This represents a 1.9 per
cent discount to the last traded price on the foreign shares on August 22.
Lead manager BZW said the new equity would raise the percentage of foreign
ownership of the company to close to the maximum level of 49 per cent.
There is a restriction on foreign ownership because the company controls the
media in Singapore.

FT  26 AUG 94 / International Bonds: Japanese borrower launches Dollars 500m
issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Eurobond market appeared to start winding down for the long weekend,
with London closed for a bank holiday on Monday.
Japan Highway Public Corporation launched its long-awaited Dollars 500m
10-year bond issue, with Nomura and LTCB International as joint lead
managers. The bonds were priced slightly more tightly than expected,
yielding 32 basis points over Treasuries at their re-offer price. The spread
widened slightly after the issue was freed to trade, but it is expected to
be held in by the lead managers.
Some east Asian demand was reported, but the majority was said to have been
taken up by European institutional investors. However, the prospect of heavy
supply of Japanese government-backed bonds in the near future held some
investors back, one trader said.
A swap opportunity in the Ecu market spurred the launch of two
retail-targeted four-year bond issues from triple-A rated borrowers: Ecu150m
for KfW International Finance via BZW and Ecu100m for General Electric
Capital Corporation via UBS. Both deals were priced almost identically,
offering a 7 3/4 per cent coupon and maturing on the same day.
Both lead managers reported solid demand for their deals from Swiss and
Benelux retail accounts, helped partly by investors' desire to roll over
funds from expiring Ecu bonds.
In the Canadian dollar sector, Toronto-Dominion Bank led an issue of
CDollars 100m of five-year bonds for itself.
Priced to yield 23 basis points over the interpolated Canadian government
bond yield curve, the terms were deemed by some to be too aggressive, but
others said recent Swiss and Benelux retail demand for four-year Canadian
dollar paper would lend the issue support.
'It's not a generous spread, but the issue will go over time,' said one
syndicate official.
Late in the day, CS First Boston launched a three-tranche asset-backed issue
totalling Dollars 1.2bn for Banc One Student Loan Trust.

order

<TEXT>
Nynex, the New York based 'Baby Bell' regional telephone company, has asked
the US justice department for an exemption from the provisions of a 1984
court order that barred the regional operators from the long-distance
telephone business.
In its filing to the justice department, Nynex argued that the widespread
competition among local telephone service providers in the New York region
meant that the company had already met most of the tough standards federal
policy makers are considering before they would allow the Baby Bells into
the long distance business.
Congress is deliberating bills to allow the Baby Bells into the
long-distance business, but the passage of any legislation still appears to
be a long way off. Nynex's action adds to the pressure for quick action to
deregulate the long-distance market. The company's request for a waiver,
however, is unlikely to speed up the process.

Mr Tajudin Ramli, the Malaysian entrepreneur who has recently taken control
of Malaysian Airlines (MAS), says a thorough restructuring of the
financially troubled national carrier will be carried out to boost profits.
Mr Tajudin was made MAS chairman last month following a controversial,
highly leveraged MDollars 1.79bn (USDollars 690m) deal which gave his listed
Malaysian Helicopter Services (MHS) company a controlling 32 per cent stake
in the airline.
'The company has gone in various directions in the last couple of years but
has lacked focus,' said Mr Ramli, after the MAS annual meeting. 'If we don't
change, the same fate could happen to us as Pan Am.' (The US airline went
bankrupt in 1991.)
Mr Ramli said six or seven MAS divisions would be hived off to force them to
become more profitable. An extensive cost-cutting programme would also be
implemented with the aim of saving between MDollars 40m and MDollars 50m
over the next six months.
Mr Ramli said that aircraft purchase agreements and recently established
routings would be included in a review of MAS operations now under way, but
lay-offs would be avoided among the airline's 19,000 staff.
In the year to March 31 1994 MAS had a pre-tax profit of MDollars 16m, a 90
per cent drop on the previous year. An ambitious expansion programme
involving the purchase of 72 aircraft valued at MDollars 10.6bn in the
1991-96 period has severely strained financial resources. Analysts also
point out that MAS is overstaffed in comparison with most other
international carriers.
Mr Ramli said that as part of the restructuring process, Mr Wan Malek
Ibrahim, executive director at MHS, would be made managing director.
Philippine Airlines (PAL), the national carrier, yesterday announced changes
in senior management on the day that it revealed a slide into loss after two
years of profit, writes Jose Galang in Manila.
Mr Harry Tan and Mr Florencio Santos, both directors at Fortune Tobacco, the
company owned by Mr Lucio Tan, lead investor in the PR Holdings group which
acquired majority ownership of PAL in 1992, join the board, replacing Mr
Antonio Cojuangco and Mr Roberto de Ocampo. Mr Mariano Tanenglian becomes
treasurer.
In the year to March, PAL made a net loss of 451m pesos (Dollars 17m)
compared with net profits of 1.03bn pesos in fiscal 1992-93.

America West Airlines yesterday became the last of three big US airlines to
emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection following the reorganisation of
Continental Airlines and TWA last year.
The new America West will be effectively controlled by Air Partners, the
same investment group that brought Continental Airlines out of bankruptcy
last year and which now owns 28 per cent of Continental.
One of Air Partners' principals is Mr David Bonderman, the Texas financier
who is Continental's non-executive chairman.
Air Partners is the leader of a consortium called AmWest Partners, which has
invested Dollars 214.9m in America West in return for 33.5 per cent of its
shares and 71.2 per cent of the voting interest.
Other members of the consortium are Continental Airlines itself; Mesa
Airlines, a regional carrier based in New Mexico; and Fidelity Investments,
the largest US mutual funds group.
Of the remainder of the shares, 59.5 per cent is now held by unsecured
creditors, 5 per cent by previous shareholders, and 2 per cent by GPA, the

FT  26 AUG 94 / International Company News: Cheung Kong beats expectations

<TEXT>
Cheung Kong, the flagship of Mr Li Ka-shing's listed Hong Kong empire,
yesterday reported a 1 per cent dip in net profits to HKDollars 4.47bn
(USDollars 578.3m) for the first half of the year, against HKDollars 4.5bn
at the same stage in 1993.
The flat results, released after the market closed, were better than
analysts had expected and the counter was the most actively traded stock of
the day, rising 80 cents to HKDollars 36 in anticipation.
Stripping out the 1993 HKDollars 708m exceptional item, reaped from the
issue of two lots of guaranteed warrants enabling holders to buy Hutchison
shares held by Cheung Kong, earnings rose 17 per cent.
The bulk of property projects is to be booked in the second half of the
year.
Mr Li, chairman, said property prices across the board had begun to decline
in May. He added: 'The property market has entered a consolidation phase,
but because Hong Kong's economy remains healthy and demand for residential
property is still substantial, activity in the property market will pick up
again.'
Analysts attributed the better-than-expected results to the enhanced
contribution from Hutchison, which also reported yesterday and which is
controlled by Cheung Kong, and strong gains on treasury operations which
SBCI Finance Asia put at HKDollars 1.05bn compared with a forecast HKDollars
800m. This is in sharp contrast to treasury dealings at Hutchison, which
were hit by the downturn in bond and equity markets.
Taken on a per share basis, earnings dipped 1 per cent to HKDollars 2.03
from HKDollars 2.06 at the interim stage last year. However, shareholders
are to receive a bigger dividend, of 27 cents compared with 24 cents in the
first half of 1993.
Cheung Kong was hit with a sharply increased Hong Kong tax bill this year,
at HKDollars 426m for the group itself (without associates) compared with
HKDollars 77m in the first six months of 1993.
The company's string of properties under development - the area which, along
with the 43 per cent stake in Hutchison, last year supplied about 85 per
cent of net profits - have been supplemented with interests in
infrastructure and power plant projects in the mainland.

Walt Disney said that Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg is to step down as chairman of
its film entertainment unit, Walt Disney Pictures, when his contract expires
at the end of next month.
The group also announced that the film unit is to be restructured. It will
be split into two separate entities: one for television and
telecommunications, which will be run by Mr Richard Frank, currently
president of Disney Studios, and one for movie production and distribution,
to be run by Mr Joe Roth, chairman of the group's Caravan Pictures
affiliate.
The departure of the 43-year old Mr Katzenberg is a blow to Disney.
Under his tenure, Disney has been one of the most successful studios in
Hollywood. This year, the animated film The Lion King was a huge
international hit and is poised to become one of the most successful films
of all time.
Mr Katzenberg's decision to leave Disney is believed to be related to the
failure of Mr Michael Eisner, the group's chairman, to appoint a successor
to Mr Frank Wells, the former Disney president who was killed in a
helicopter accident in April.
Mr Katzenberg's achievements in his nearly 10 years as head of Disney's
studios had appeared to make the 43-year old executive a natural heir to Mr
Wells' position.
When Mr Eisner declined to appoint a new president, it was widely seen as a
rejection of Mr Katzenberg as a potential future Disney chairman.

<TEXT>
Matsushita Electric Industrial, the leading Japanese electronics group,
achieved a one-third increase in worldwide net profits to Y8.9bn (Dollars
90.4m) in its first quarter to June.
The company, which makes consumer products under brands such as Panasonic
and Technics and owns Universal Pictures in Hollywood, said the increase,
from last year's Y6.7bn, followed cost cuts which offset the adverse effect
of the higher yen.
It was also helped by a 3 per cent growth in revenues to Y1,642.2bn.
Sales abroad were up 9 per cent but domestic sales fell 3 per cent, although
the company said it discerned a better trend in consumer spending within
Japan. Domestic sales of both audio and video equipment suffered from what
Matsushita acknowledged was a 'shift of consumer demand to lower-priced
products'.
Overall, communications and industrial equipment showed the best growth, at
14 per cent, with what the company said were notable gains in hard disk
drives and CD-Rom drives. The electronic components side was up 3 per cent
while home appliances fell by the same margin.
A 2 per cent dip in income from its entertainment division came as the
strength of the yen eroded dollar revenues at Universal, which was raking in
box-office proceeds from the film Schindler's List. The music division also
performed well, Matsushita said.
Consolidated pre-tax profits were Y37.6bn, up 12 per cent. Net earnings per
share were Y4.23 against Y3.20.

<TEXT>
KNP BT, the Dutch paper and packaging group, swung into a profit of Fl 74m
(Dollars 42.3m) in the second quarter of 1994 from a loss of Fl 3m a year
ago, extending the recovery that emerged earlier this year.
The results, which follow a similar return to profit in the first quarter,
take first-half results to Fl 124m, a reversal of the previous year's Fl 16m
loss.
The company said it was moderately optimistic but cautioned that it could
see temporary pressure on margins as a result of further increases in raw
material prices.
It said volume was up substantially in most markets. Turnover rose by 12.4
per cent to Fl 3.2bn in the second quarter and by 13.1 per cent to Fl 6.3bn
in the first half.
Of the group's four main businesses, paper merchanting, graphic systems and
paper production all posted strong increases in results in the second
quarter. The exception was packaging, where operating profit slipped to Fl
86m from Fl 90m. KNP BT attributed the decline to rises in raw material
prices, particularly for waste paper.
KNP BT also announced yesterday that it may merge the US arm of its office
products division with Ivan Allen of Atlanta, Georgia, which it described as
the largest office products distributor in the south-east of the US. A
letter of intent has been signed but talks on a definitive deal are
continuing.
The Dutch company, which gave no financial details, has made a string of
small office-product acquisitions in the US and Germany so far this year.

<TEXT>
Shriram Industrial Enterprises, a New Delhi-based diversified group
producing sugar, air-conditioners, oils, fats and chemicals, is planning to
tap the euromarkets next week with a Dollars 75m equity offering.
Shriram, which is responding to the liberalisation of the Indian economy
with a large reorganisation, plans big expansions of capacity in sugar,
air-conditioning and the production of caustic soda. It also intends to
build a financial services business and to develop an industrial park with
its own power plant in the northern state of Punjab.
Mr Siddharth Shriram, the chairman whose family controls the group, said he
planned further share issues to fund the investment programme which would
cost about Rs10bn (Dollars 318m).
Shriram made net profits of Rs209m on sales of Rs6.8bn in the year to the
end of March. The company was originally part of DCM, one of Delhi's oldest
industrial groupings, which split three years ago following tensions in the
Shriram family.
Mr Shriram admitted that like many large Indian industrial groupings,
Shriram Industrial Enterprises had in the past diversified into too many
separate fields. He now intends to focus the group's investments on
businesses where it has competitive advantages.

<TEXT>
Investor, the most important holding company of Sweden's powerful Wallenberg
empire, increased pre-tax profits more than three times in the first half,
after a strong rebound at Saab-Scania, its wholly owned vehicle and
aerospace unit.
The group's pre-tax income amounted to SKr1.19bn (Dollars 156m) for the
period, compared with SKr367m a year earlier. It said second-half income
would be higher than in the first. The shares rose SKr5 to SKr176.
A much improved performance at Saab-Scania - which last week reported a
pre-tax profit, after financial items, of SKr1.2bn, against a SKr264m loss
in 1993 - was the main reason for the upturn. Saab-Scania's earnings are
also expected to be stronger in the second half.
The group's investment performance - it has strategic shareholdings in a
clutch of Swedish blue-chips, including Astra, Ericsson, Electrolux, Stora
and SKF - was more disappointing as it failed to be keep pace with the stock
exchange. The value of the group's investment portfolio at June 30 was
SKr27.5bn, down 7 per cent since the start of the year, compared with a 2
per cent drop for the Affarsvarlden General Index.
The group's net worth at the same date was SKr38.3bn, or SKr192 a share,
compared with SKr37.5bn, or SKr206 at the year-end. Both the value of the
portfolio and net worth have risen since June 30.
Net debt rose to SKr6.88bn from SKr4.85bn, partly because of higher tied-up
working capital within Saab-Scania.

<TEXT>
NEC, the Japanese electronics company, is considering introducing
IBM-compatible machines in its domestic computer range for the first time.
The move highlights the growing influence of IBM's standard in the Japanese
market.
NEC said that it was looking into the possibility of introducing
IBM-compatible high-end servers based on the Pentium microprocessor made by
Intel. Servers are the machines which store data that can be shared among
several computers and link them in a network.
It is an important shift in NEC's strategy for the domestic market, where
its proprietary PCs have more than a 50 per cent share of all installed
machines.
NEC has jealously guarded the turf won by its proprietary PCs, refusing to
introduce IBM-compatible PCs in Japan even while other Japanese competitors,
with their own proprietary machines, have done so one by one.
NEC said it was considering the introduction of IBM-compatible high-end
servers in order to meet the needs of its customers. These servers would be
aimed at companies wanting to link up 20 or more computers in the office.
Office servers can cost anywhere from Y1m to hundreds of millions of yen,
and the Japanese market for high-end servers amounted to Y508bn (Dollars
5.16bn) last year.
The shift in NEC's strategy reflects the spreading acceptance in Japan of
IBM's architecture, which is a de facto standard in the rest of the world
but has been slow to catch on in Japan where Japanese computer companies
have promoted their own proprietary standards.
The company emphasised, however, that it had no plans to introduce
IBM-compatible PC servers.

A strong performance in insurance helped ING Group, the Dutch financial
services company, to boost first-half net profit by 19.9 per cent to Fl
1.07bn (Dollars 610m) from Fl 892m a year earlier.
Pre-tax insurance results were up 31 per cent, far outstripping the 9.1 per
cent rise in banking earnings.
The company gave no separate figures for the second quarter.
However, comparisons with the first-quarter results published in June showed
that growth in earnings slowed to 12.5 per cent in the quarter from 26.8 per
cent in the first three months of the year.
First-quarter results had also shown the same pattern of significant
increases in insurance and flatter growth in banking.
For the full year, ING forecast that net profit per share would at least
match the 1993 result of Fl 8.06.
ING's banking results in the first half were affected by a sharp turnround
in results from trading in Latin American debt securities, mainly in the
first quarter of the year.
Its results from financial transactions, securities and participations fell
into a loss of Fl 8m in the first six months from a profit of Fl 566m a year
earlier.
In insurance, results were helped by buoyant earnings in life insurance,
ING's single largest business, which saw a 25.2 per cent increase.
Results were also aided by the decision in April 1993 to deconsolidate two
loss-making subsidiaries, Orion in the UK and NRG, its reinsurance business.

Second-quarter profits of Canada's 154 investment firms dropped by half to

The first quarter had set a peak profit of CDollars 238m. First-half profits
were CDollars 353m against CDollars 360m a year earlier. Return on equity

Renison Gold Fields, the Australian mining group 40 per cent-owned by the
Anglo-American Hanson group, made a ADollars 1.8m (USDollars 1.3m) profit
after tax and abnormals in the year to end-June, compared with a ADollars
24.4m loss in the previous year, writes Nikki Tait.
The turnround was largely due to the absence of abnormal items, which cut
ADollars 36.1m off the previous year's figure. Operating profit before tax
and abnormals fell from ADollars 25.4m to ADollars 20.3m, although the
company said this masked a sharp improvement in the second half of 1993-94,
when profits were ADollars 25.4m, after a first-half loss of ADollars 5.1m.
Total revenues were 1.8 per cent lower at ADollars 610.9m, and no dividends
are being declared.

Hollinger, the holding company of publisher Mr Conrad Black, reported
second-quarter profits of CDollars 96.6m (USDollars 70m), or CDollars 1.67 a
share, including a CDollars 82m special gain, up from CDollars 10.9m, or 16
cents, a year earlier, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
The special gain came from the sale of shares in the Daily Telegraph
newspaper in the UK. Excluding this, Hollinger's per share earnings were 25
cents in the latest period. Revenues rose to CDollars 350m from CDollars
228m reflecting acquisition of the Chicago Sun-Times.
Hollinger said a 'major contribution' from the Chicago paper more than
offset the Telegraph's decline.
Half-year net profit was CDollars 109.2m, or CDollars 1.88 a share, up from
CDollars 24.7m, or 36 cents, on revenues of CDollars 584m against CDollars
426m. The latest period includes the special gain.

second quarter

Dell Computer, the US personal computer manufacturer, staged a recovery in
its second quarter, as it refocused its operations on direct sales via
telephone and mail order.
Sales increased to Dollars 791.5m, up 13 per cent from Dollars 700.6m a year
ago, and up 3 per cent from this year's first quarter.
Net income for the latest quarter was Dollars 28.6m, or 65 cents a share,
after a Dollars 6.2m after-tax charge related to the company's closure of
its investment derivatives and short-term investments with principal
exposure. This compared with a net loss of Dollars 75.7m, or Dollars 2.03,
in the same period last year after charges of about Dollars 75m.
'We have begun to reinvigorate our customer-direct (sales via telephone and
mail order) business with more aggressive pricing,' said Mr Michael Dell,
chairman and chief executive. Last month Dell announced that it would
withdraw from the retail sales channel to concentrate on direct sales.
The shift appears to be paying off for Dell. Retail consumer sales declined
to 3 per cent of revenues in the second quarter, down from 8 per cent in the
previous quarter and 9 per cent in the second quarter last year, the company
said. Excluding consumer sales, worldwide sales increased 9 per cent
sequentially and 19 per cent on a year-on-year basis.
During the second quarter Dell re-entered the portable computer market with
the introduction of new notebook models. Last year the company was forced to
withdraw its notebook computers due to design flaws.
'Our portables plan is on track and on time,' Mr Dell said. Sales of
notebook computers represented 5 per cent of systems revenue in the quarter,
he said.
Gross margins declined only modestly, in spite of more aggressive pricing,
the company said. It cautioned, however, that following price cuts by Compaq
Computer and IBM, 'the industry pricing environment continues to be dynamic
and Dell intends to retain a competitive pricing position'.
For the first six months of fiscal 1995, sales increased 13 per cent to
Dollars 1.56bn from Dollars 1.37bn in the first half of fiscal 1994. Net
income was Dollars 47.5m, or Dollars 1.06 a share, against a loss of Dollars
65.5m, or Dollars 1.76.

<TEXT>
Telebras, Brazil's government-controlled telecommunications group, has
launched a programme to attract private-sector investment to the industry.
However, the move will not change Telebras's monopoly position, which is
guaranteed by the constitution.
The company, which has a backlog of about 10m telephone lines, is being
forced to relax its hold on the system because of a capital investment
crisis caused largely by government-imposed limits. This year's Dollars 3bn
investment budget should be doubled to cope with demand, according to
analysts.
Under a new partnership programme, announced on Tuesday, the private sector
will be able to install lines and networks, leasing them to Telebras's
regional subsidiaries.
According to analysts, the installations will be turned over to Telebras
when the leasing period has expired.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
General Electric of the US yesterday confirmed that it was interested in
acquiring a stake in Lindner, the German-based light-bulb maker.
General Electric's renewed interest in the company followed a decision
earlier this week by Germany's Federal Cartel Office to reject a proposed
takeover of Lindner by Philips, the Dutch-based manufacturer of light bulbs.
The cartel office argued the proposed takeover would strengthen Philips'
dominant position in the German market. Along with Osram, a subsidiary of
Siemens, Philips holds 80 per cent of the German light bulb market.
Philips yesterday said the company had not decided whether to appeal against
the decision at the Kammergericht, Germany's appeal court.
The cartel office ruling could clear the way for GE. It said it had an
interest in Lindner. Previous talks between the two ended by mutual
agreement in October 1993.
GE said Germany was a 'strategic and important market for all of General
Electric'. Last year's turnover in the country's lighting market totalled
Dollars 600m.
General Electric Lighting, the German subsidiary of GE, has 9 per cent of
the German market.

<TEXT>
Hutchison Whampoa, the Hong Kong conglomerate controlled by Mr Li Ka-shing,
yesterday surprised the market with a 48 per cent rise in first-half
earnings to HKDollars 3.7bn (USDollars 480m), up from HKDollars 2.5bn in the
same period last year.
Only the most bullish forecasts anticipated the rise, which has perked up
what had been, by Hong Kong terms, a disappointing results season.
Analysts attributed the performance to strong, focused management under Mr
Canning Fok, group managing director, who has shaken up divisions and
overseen a return to traditional interests, namely China, ports and
property.
Hutchison was helped by the closure of the loss-making Rabbit telepoint
system in the UK and last year's disposal of stakes in Star TV. Half-year
figures were lifted by a higher contribution from Hongkong Electric, an
associate company whose six-month profits rose 33 per cent to HKDollars
1.73bn, and the increased interest in Hongkong International Terminals
(HIT).
HIT's facilities were expanded over the period, and traffic rose 27 per cent
year-on-year. The ports in Shanghai and Zhuhai, in which Hutchison has
stakes of 40 per cent and 50 per cent respectively, are in profit.
Profits grew at Felixstowe, the UK port wholly owned by the group. A letter
of intent has been signed to take a 50 per cent stake in the construction
and operating of a three-berth deep-water container terminal in Freeport,
Grand Bahama.
The profits rise came on a 22 per cent improvement in turnover, up to
HKDollars 14bn from HKDollars 11.5bn. Taken on a per share basis, earnings
rose 39 per cent to HKDollars 1.03 from HKDollars 0.74. The interim dividend
is increased to 26 cents from 19 cents last year.
Mr Li Ka-shing, chairman, said the company had progressively built up a
portfolio of joint-venture property development projects in China. 'In time
these should enhance the group's development profit and recurrent income.'
Hutchison plans to open its Park'N Shop supermarkets in Shanghai later this
year and is testing its Watson's chemists in Malaysia.

FT  26 AUG 94 / International Company News: Swedbank trims annual profits
forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Swedbank, the Nordic region's largest bank by asset value, yesterday
punctured some of the optimism returning to the Swedish banking sector by
downgrading its full-year underlying earnings forecast because of worries
over the state of the national economy.
The bank reported a swing to an operating profit in the first six months of
SKr1.75bn (Dollars 223m) from a loss last time of SKr1.59bn, due to a 53 per
cent fall in loan losses to SKr2.7bn from SKr5.8bn in the same period last
year.
The result followed a similar pattern to those announced earlier this week
by Swedbank's main rivals, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Svenska
Handelsbanken and Nordbanken, which all reported sharply improved profits
due to lower loan losses.
However, Swedbank stressed that earnings before loan losses had weakened due
to lower interest income, narrower margins and lower bond trading results.
This was a feature shown by the other banks but overshadowed by the
improvement in the loan losses which caused a crisis in the banking sector
two years ago.
Swedbank said lower loan losses could produce a full-year operating profit.
But it lowered its forecast for profits before loan losses (and excluding
capital gains) to SKr5.5bn from its earlier prediction of SKr6.5bn. It said
uncertainty about the economy, mainly stemming from high interest rates,
threatened to spill over into the house lending and consumer credit market.
In the first six months, Swedbank's net interest income fell 18 per cent to
SKr4.93bn from SKr5.99bn. Operating income before loan losses was ahead
slightly at SKr4.48bn, but would have been down 15 per cent from last year's
SKr4.2bn without a SKr1.58bn one-off capital gain.
The banks' results were hit by lower returns from their bond portfolios. But
the impact was softened, compared with banks in other countries, because
Swedish accounting practices allow the banks to keep unrealised losses in
the value of their investment portfolios out of the operating profit. Such
losses are shown only at the year end as appropriations after operating
profit.
A beneficiary of this was Handelsbanken, which has increased its holdings of
government securities and bonds by 76 per cent over the past year to soak up
surplus liquidity. The bank said the value of its investment portfolio at
the end of June was SKr2.7bn less than the purchase price.
Under Danish accounting rules, this would have wiped out Handelsbanken's
reported SKr2.3bn half-year operating profit. Similarly, Nordbanken, which
made a SKr2.46bn operating profit, would have been hit by SKr2.9bn in
below-purchase price values of external and in-house bond holdings. The
figure was SKr550m at SE-Banken, which reported an operating profit of
SKr2.22bn, and SKr416m at Swedbank.

FT  26 AUG 94 / International Company News: Trelleborg returns to black in
first six months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trelleborg, the Swedish mining and metals group that is restructuring,
yesterday reported a swing back to profit in the first half of the year.
It posted a pre-tax surplus of SKr351m (Dollars 45m) after a loss of SKr528m
in the same period last year. Sales were down to SKr9.57bn from SKr10.83bn
mainly due to the effects of disposals. But each of the four main divisions
 -mines and smelters, rubber products, metal processing and distribution -
sharply improved operating results. Lower operating costs, lower interest
costs and contributions from associated companies produced the return to the
black.
The company said a large rise in base metals prices - with the exception of
zinc - helped the mines and smelters division, the biggest Trelleborg
operation, rebound to a SKr30m operating profit from a loss last time of
SKr35m. Overall operating profits jumped to SKr424m from SKr105m.
A continuation of present metal prices and an expected further improvement
in the other divisions promised 'significantly better' group earnings in the
second half, the group forecast.
Net interest costs fell to SKr216m from SKr435m thanks to a SKr1.08bn fall
in net borrowings to SKr6.13bn and lower interest rates. Trelleborg's
guarantee commitment on loans of SKr3.65bn held by Falconbridge, the nickel
producer, was erased when Falconbridge used the proceeds of a share issue to
pay off debt.
The share issue reduced Trelleborg's stake in Falconbridge to less than 30
per cent from 50 per cent. But improved results at Falconbridge still helped
to push up Trelleborg's contributions from associated companies to SKr150m
from a loss of SKr130m last year.

FT  26 AUG 94 / International Company News: Recovery continues at Bayer with
30% gain
</HEADLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The recovery at Bayer, the large German chemicals group, continued with a 30
per cent rise in second-quarter earnings and a 24 per cent advance for the
half-year.
The group, which started the year predicting a profits advance of up to 20
per cent for the full 12 months, yesterday reported pre-tax income for the
first half of DM999m (Dollars 624m) on sales up 6 per cent at DM22bn.
Rival Hoechst, which published its interim figures earlier this week, said
pre-tax earnings had risen 39 per cent to DM1bn on barely-changed sales.
Profits at BASF rose 41 per cent in the half.
Bayer, like its competitors, yesterday indicated falling prices were still a
problem.
Turnover at Bayer AG, the German parent, was unchanged because a 4 per cent
drop in prices cancelled out 7 per cent volume growth. The sales figure was
also diluted by the transfer of the fibres business into another part of the
group.
Turnover at European subsidiaries edged upwards to DM13bn, while North
America recorded a 9 per cent sales rise. The Asia-Pacific and African
regions advanced 19 per cent.
All operational sectors contributed to the recovery, with chemicals growing
particularly strongly. Healthcare improved 8 per cent, while growth in
consumer products sales, mainly in the Agfa film and tape business, was
limited to 2 per cent. Bayer blamed poor domestic demand.
The group attributed part of the profits progress to higher capacity use and
cost-saving measures of the past few years. As with the other German
chemicals concerns, Bayer has continued pruning costs, especially in its
domestic operations.
The total workforce fell 2,600 in the review period and the rise in
personnel costs was limited to 2 per cent in spite of higher social security
costs and adverse exchange rate movements.

loss

<TEXT>
Krupp Hoesch, the merged steel and engineering group, yesterday said it had
slashed losses to DM47m (Dollars 29.90m) for the first six months, compared
with a DM324m deficit for the same period last year.
The Essen-based group operated profitably during June for the first time
since the merger in December 1992. It forecast a break-even by the end of
the year and said that steel would be the only one of the six divisions to
be making a loss, although it would be much lower than the DM780m loss
reported in 1993.
Aggressive cost-cutting and savings created by bringing together
complementary sectors within the two groups had helped the performance, a
spokesman said.
The company shed 11,041 workers, or 13 per cent of the workforce, in the 12
months to June 30 and said it would shed about 2,000 more before the end of
the year. This would bring the workforce to around 70,000, down from about
95,000 at the time of the merger.
Strong exports and signs that the German market is pulling out of its worst
post-war recession also aided the recovery. Turnover in the first six months
rose 6 per cent to DM10bn, while group orders increased 12 per cent to
DM11.2bn.
Steel sales, which make up about 30 per cent of group turnover, rose 3 per
cent while orders climbed 18 per cent. However, industry sources said that
while the upturn in the US economy was reducing excess European capacity,
demand still needed to improve before prices could recover.

The severity of the downturn in Japan's car market and the impact of the
sharp appreciation of the yen were highlighted yesterday as Toyota, the
country's largest car maker, announced a 25 per cent decline in
unconsolidated pre-tax profits for the year to June 30.
Toyota's pre-tax profits fell to Y214bn (Dollars 2.7bn) from Y286.4bn in the
previous year on sales 10 per cent down at Y8,155bn compared with Y9,031bn.
The company cited the yen's rise against other currencies and sluggish
demand in its home market and Europe as important factors behind the
disappointing performance.
However, analysts commended the company's results which were in line with,
if not better than, expectations and forecast that Toyota would see a
rebound after cost-cutting and as the Japanese economy picked up.
The company saved Y150bn - Y110bn from improvements at the design stage. The
remaining Y40bn came through cost cuts at production facilities and in
distribution.
However, the benefits of these measures were eclipsed by the rapid rise of
the yen. Toyota said the yen's appreciation cost it Y160bn in operating
costs while slower sales cost Y70bn.
In the domestic market, Toyota vehicle sales fell 4 per cent to Y3,215bn
from Y3,346bn while exports declined by 21 per cent to Y2,055bn
fromY2,612bn, although this was in part due to increased overseas
production.
Consolidated sales were down 8 per cent at Y9,362.7bn against Y10,210.7bn.
Group pre-tax profits declined 27 per cent to Y236.5bn from Y322.2bn while
net income fell 29 per cent to Y125.8bn from Y176.5bn.
The dividend is unchanged at Y19 per share.
Toyota is forecasting a 7.5 per cent increase in the current fiscal year due
to the introduction of models which satisfy increasingly cost-conscious
customers as well as a recovery in Japan and Europe.
It believes the Japanese market will rise to 5m units in 1994 from 4.89m in
1993 and Toyota expects its sales to increase to 2.13m units from 2.07m.
It is moving its year-end to March and forecasts pre-tax profits of Y200bn
and net profits of Y100bn on sales of Y6,200bn for the nine-months.

FT  26 AUG 94 / UK Company News: BSkyB soars to Pounds 177m as subscribers
increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Sky Broadcasting, the UK satellite broadcasting venture, yesterday
announced a continuing rise in both subscribers and profits in the year to
June 30.
Profits for shareholders jumped from Pounds 54.1m to Pounds 176.8m, which
includes external interest payments but not interest due on loan stock held
by shareholders.
Amid speculation that the rate of increase in the number of subscribers had
been levelling off, BSkyB said that during the year the number of paying
subscribers had increased from 2.35m to 3.45m and the upward trend was
continuing.
The company said the number of subscribers to the BSkyB movie channels had
now reached 2.6m, with 2.5m subscribing to the Sports Channel.
More than 88 per cent of all subscribers were paying for at least one
premium channel.
The results were announced as the company plans to add four new programme
services to the existing 12 channels in Sky TV's multi-channel basic package
on top of a second sports service at weekends.
The four range from the 24 hours a day music channel, VH-1, to the Learning
Channel, broadcasting for seven hours a day, a 12-hour Travel Channel and
four hours a day during the week of the Romance Channel - devoted to soap
opera.
The introduction of the new package of channels could presage an increase in
the cost of the basic subscription package.
Mr Richard Brooke, chief financial officer, would only say yesterday:
'Pricing is something we look at as we add value to the package.'
BSkyB returned Pounds 620m to shareholders during the year, Pounds 120m from
operating cash and Pounds 500m in loans raised from a syndicate of banks.
Mr Brooke said he expected to pay a further Pounds 200m this year towards
the Pounds 1.25bn still outstanding on their investment.
The main BSkyB shareholders are News Corporation with 50 per cent, Pearson,
the media and information group which owns the Financial Times, and
Chargeurs, the French transportation and media group, with 17.5 per cent
each and Granada Group with 13.5 per cent.
Mr David Chance, deputy managing director of BSkyB, said he was confident
that the current upward trends in satellite dish sales and subscriptions
would continue.
'In the last five weeks dish sales have increased from 11,000 to 17,000 a
week and that's before the autumn promotion,' he said.
He added that 'churn' - the industry term for subscribers who have switched
off - had been cut from 15 per cent in 1992-93 to 12 per cent this year.

rising from Pounds 318.3m to Pounds 380.4m.
Operating profits of Pounds 170.1m (Pounds 61.5m) were boosted by a Pounds
20m profit on the sale of the second Marcopolo satellite which used to
broadcast BSB services before the merger with Sky.
Losses of Pounds 4.3m from associated companies related to the start-up cost

FT  26 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Jupiter European to triple in size
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jupiter European Investment Trust has announced plans to raise more than
Pounds 41m of new capital through a placing and open offer.
This would almost triple the size of the split-capital trust, which was
launched in 1990 and has assets of about Pounds 25m.
'We believe the current weakness in European equity markets represents an
opportune time to expand significantly JEIT's investment portfolio,' said Mr
John Duffield, chairman of Jupiter Tyndall Group, which manages the trust.
The issue will not change the capital structure of the trust, but it will
increase the net asset value per ordinary share by 2.7 per cent, and
increase the capital cover on zero dividend shares from 1.62 to 1.65.
All the 29m new zero dividend shares, at 46 1/2 p, and 29m new ordinary
shares, at 92p, have been placed with institutions, but can be recalled to
meet demand from existing shareholders in the open offer.
The trust is also placing 5.8m new warrants at 52p. At this price, the zero
dividend shares have an annualised gross redemption yield of 10 per cent,
and the ord-inary shares yield 2.3 per cent.
Existing shareholders and warrant holders are being offered new shares in
the ratio of 1.3 new ordinary shares for each ordinary share held, 1.3 zero
dividend shares for each zero held, and 1.3 ordinary shares and 1.3 zero
dividend shares for each warrant held.
The open offer closes on September 16, and a meeting to approve the
proposals will be held on September 19.
Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor of the exchequer, recently joined
the board of Jupiter European as a non-executive director. He is also on the
boards of two other investment trusts managed by Jupiter Tyndall.

FT  26 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Finnish purchase lifts Life Sciences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Life Sciences International, the laboratory equipment company, yesterday
announced a 28 per cent increase in first half profits after enjoying
contributions from new acquisitions and improved European distribution.
Input from Labsystems, the Finnish pipette maker acquired for Pounds 33.5m
last year, helped lift pre-tax profits from Pounds 10.3m to Pounds 13.2m for
the six months to June 30, on turnover ahead 31 per cent at Pounds 86.8m
(Pounds 66.2m).
Of the increased profit, almost half was due to the new subsidiary.
'Labsystems has been very important to us,' said Sir Christopher Bland,
chairman. 'It has strengthened our presence in Europe and given us access to
new markets in China and Japan.'
The subsidiary's buoyant performance underpinned trading profits of Pounds
14m (Pounds 10.2m), and helped offset subdued conditions in key markets such
as North America, France and the UK.
Nevertheless, the group said it managed to overcome weak demand by building
market share 'through the exertions' of its direct sales force.
The shares closed up 8p at 153p, some 43 per cent ahead of the year's low of
107p.
Sir Christopher, formerly chairman of London Weekend Television, claimed
partial responsibility for the market's renewed enthusiasm.
'When the shares dipped, I doubled my holding to some 2m shares. It restored
confidence and cheered people up a bit.'
He also said the group hoped to reduce gearing from 71 per cent - equivalent
to borrowing of Pounds 28m - to less than 60 per cent by the year end.
Borrowings increased following the purchase of Labsystems and the Pounds
15.9m acquisition of Hybaid, the molecular biology company, in June.
The large proportion of high margin products, meanwhile, helped cash
generation reach 82 per cent of trading profit.
Earnings per share rose from 4.3p to 5p, on a fully diluted basis.
An interim dividend of 1.6p (1.4p) is declared, with a scrip alternative for
the fifth successive year.
COMMENT
Having given up the helm at LWT, Sir Christopher has been able to devote
more time to Life Sciences. It shows. The group has bounced back from
disappointing full year figures thanks to better housekeeping and profits
from Labsystems, which has proved a very shrewd acquisition. However, some
hurdles remain before it achieves the kind of growth to push the shares back
to January's 171p high. It must pursue greater market share in the UK and
win sizeable orders from the US government's research funding budget. If it
achieves those two goals, full year profits could exceed Pounds 28m. On a
forward multiple approaching 14, the shares are worth considering as a
long-term investment.

Scottish Investment Trust saw a decline in its net asset value from 280p per
share at its October 31 year-end to 273.3p at July 31. However, over the 12
months net asset value rose by 7.6 per cent.
Gross revenue for the nine months increased to Pounds 22m (Pounds 20.5m);
the costs of servicing the new Pounds 50m debenture, however, meant that

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Roxspur yesterday reported its first full-year profit since it was floated
as Levercrest in June 1990, helped by improved manufacturing efficiency and
a contribution from Brearley Group, acquired in March.
On increased sales of Pounds 4.51m (Pounds 4.18m) a pre-tax profit of Pounds
120,000 was achieved, compared with a Pounds 125,000 deficit previously.
Roxspur said that its strong second half bias had continued.
Levercrest, which manufactures and installs playground equipment, increased
manufacturing efficiency and made a substantial contribution to operating
profits of Pounds 189,000 (Pounds 29,000 losses). The operating line was
struck after absorbing Pounds 175,000 of abortive acquisition costs.
In the 10 weeks since its acquisition, Brearley added Pounds 4,000 to
overall pre-tax profits on sales of Pounds 703,000. The group makes
electronic and electro-mechanical products.
Group earnings per share were 0.4p, compared with losses of 0.9p.

FT  26 AUG 94 / UK Company News: JFB raises Pounds 6.25m in MBO and issues
trading warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATRINA LOWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Johnson &amp; Firth Brown, the specialist engineering group, is selling a
portfolio of companies from its light engineering division to Clearbase, a
consortium led by Mr George Hardie, joint managing director and finance
director of JFB.
JFB also said that problems at Woodbank (UK), a lossmaking light engineering
company, were 'considerably more serious than previously expected' and were
likely to have an adverse effect on trading in the year to September 30.
JFB said the gross proceeds would be Pounds 6.25m cash, representing
consideration of Pounds 3.97m and Pounds 2.28m as repayment for
inter-company debt. Further payment up to Pounds 500,000 might become due
depending on the extent to which Clearbase was able to utilise tax losses
being transferred to it.
In June, JFB announced interim pre-tax losses of Pounds 842,000, against
profits of Pounds 2.07m, and said there were plans to sell companies in the
light engineering division as part of the group's efforts to focus on core
activities.
Mr Hardie said yesterday that Pounds 2.75m of the funding would come from
the management and venture capitalists, with the remainder from Bank of
Scotland. Gearing was expected to be about 90 per cent. The post of finance
director, would be filled by Mr Tony Edisbury, JFB company secretary.
Shareholder approval for the deal will be sought at an extraordinary meeting
on September 12.
Turnover of the companies being sold amounted to Pounds 21.2m in the year to
September 30 for pre-tax profits of Pounds 783,000.
JFB's shares closed 3p down at 41p.

FT  26 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Slough advances to Pounds 33.3m -
Development activities revived as industrial demand improves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Slough Estates, the UK's largest industrial property company, yesterday
announced a 16 per cent increase, from Pounds 28.8m to Pounds 33.3m, in
pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30, reflecting an improving
rental market.
Sir Nigel Mobbs, chairman, was 'confident about the medium term prospects
for property in general and the company in particular'. He said Slough was
seeking more acquisitions, following the Pounds 76m invested in the first
half.
After a lull during the property slump of 1991-92, the company has revived
its property development activities, constructing 145,000 sq ft of property
in the last six months. It is proceeding with a further 230,000 sq ft of
development.
Mr Derek Wilson, group managing director, said Slough would proceed with
selective 'speculative developments', as demand for new industrial property
had substantially improved.
Turnover fell from Pounds 99m to Pounds 92.5m as a result of a sharp decline
in property trading activity.
Property investment revenue, however, increased from Pounds 66m to Pounds
72.1m.
In the UK, occupancy rose from 92.2 per cent to 93.4 per cent, as the
company achieved significant lettings. Occupancy levels for its
international portfolio also improved.
During the period, the company sold ADollars 46m (Pounds 21.9m) of
Australian property at above book value, but trading profits amounted to
only Pounds 800,000 and there were Pounds 500,000 of provisions against the
values of its trading portfolio. Property investment profits amounted to
Pounds 59.5m (Pounds 55.3m).
Slough acquired a Pounds 15.3m industrial estate, the Pounds 55m Winnersh
Triangle business estate, and Pounds 5.5m of industrial property in London
during the first six months of 1994, following five years of limited
activity.
The company is looking for other purchases, 'on a selective basis'.
There was a Pounds 4.4m associates' profit from disposals from the Candover
1989 Fund, compared with a nil contribution in 1993.
Basic earnings per share increased from 4.4p to 4.7p.
The interim dividend is held at 3.1p, as expected, as the 1993 full year
dividend was uncovered.

FT  26 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Engineering sale helps Bridon to Pounds
3.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bridon, the Doncaster-based wire and wire rope supplier which has been
undergoing a substantial restructuring, yesterday reported sharply higher
interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.3m, up from Pounds 1.1m.
The pre-tax result for the six months to June 30 included an Pounds 800,000
credit from the sale in April of the lossmaking engineering division, as
part of the group's comprehensive restructuring programme, dubbed Project
360. Net interest costs fell to Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 1.8m).
Turnover from continuing operations was flat at Pounds 139.8m (Pounds
141.5m) while the discontinued engineering businesses added Pounds 10.5m
(Pounds 22.3m).
Earnings per share increased to 5.1p (1.6p) and the interim dividend is
unchanged at 1.25p.
Operating profits for continuing activities increased to Pounds 4.2m (Pounds
1.8m after Pounds 1.2m of restructuring costs). The core wire, wire rope and
associated products business contributed Pounds 2.4m (Pounds 1.5m) on
turnover of Pounds 116m (Pounds 114.8m).
Mr Ron Petersen, chief executive, said all of the group's distribution
companies, with the exception of CIFAST in Italy where there were now signs
of improvement, had improved their performance during the period.
In manufacturing, while there were no further increases in the cost of wire
rod in the first half, increases were expected in the second half. However,
Mr Petersen said the market place remained intensely competitive.
Last month the group ceased production at its Belgian rope manufacturing
plant. Production of specialised crane ropes is being transferred to the UK.
The Pounds 4.5m costs of closing the Belgian facility will be taken against
the provisions made in the 1993 accounts.
The costs of acquisitions and restructuring in the first half were more than
offset by the benefits of the Pounds 13m proceeds from the disposal of the
engineering division.
Net borrowings at June 30 were Pounds 21m (Pounds 28m), representing gearing
of 23.6 per cent.

FT  26 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Kleeneze sells store chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kleeneze Holdings, the home shopping group, yesterday announced its
withdrawal from high street retailing with the sale of The Leading Edge, its
store chain.
The group's five lossmaking outlets - selling innovative products ranging
from an electronic thesaurus to designer clocks - are being sold to
Revelation (Piccadilly), the privately-owned luggage retailer, for about
Pounds 850,000.
Mr Robin Klein, Kleeneze chairman, said the deal marked the culmination of a
two-year restructuring which has seen it sell three subsidiaries: Molly
Housewares, Kleeneze Hygiene and Dalton Young - its toiletries division.
The move follows the collapse of a joint venture with PowerStore, the
showroom buy-out from London Electricity, to develop The Leading Edge into a
profitable chain of at least 40 outlets.
Although Mr Klein said store sales had been encouraging, high overhead costs
and onerous lease agreements led to losses of Pounds 1.03m in the year to
August 31 last year and a Pounds 324,000 deficit in the six months to
February 28.
'This completes our transformation into a focused home shopping group. It
removes the final lossmaking activity and it will free management time and
working capital which can now be concentrated on our growing business -
Kleeneze Homecare and Innovations.'
The shares were unchanged at 203p.

FT  26 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Hambro C'wide surprises with loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hambro Countrywide, the estate agency and financial services chain,
surprised the stock market yesterday with the announcement of an interim
loss, in spite of increasing house sales and an improved market share.
The share price fell 5 1/2 p to 49p, as Hambro revealed a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 707,000 for the six months to June 30, compared with a Pounds 13.4m
profit. Brokers had expected a profit of Pounds 3m.
The figures were depressed by a Pounds 1.8m provision against unrealised
losses from its gilt portfolio, reflecting the falling bond market. This
compared with a Pounds 1.2m profit from these investments last time.
Increased turnover of Pounds 49.2m (Pounds 48.8m) reflected improved house
sales.
However, the key figure was an unexpected rise in losses from its estate
agency division to Pounds 2.18m (Pounds 1.73m).
Mr Colin Finch, deputy chairman, said: 'Its not surprising in a market which
has failed to sustain any recovery in activity.'
The estate agencies sold 23,341 houses during the period, and increased
market share, against an estimated decline in the market of about 3 per
cent.
However, staff numbers increased from 2,487 to 2,539, and after three years
of freezes, the staff finally achieved a pay increase.
The average house price increased by 5 per cent to Pounds 64,700, but
increased revenue did not keep track with costs.
Life assurance activity declined from Pounds 5.34m to Pounds 1.66m. This
reflected the bond losses, and a change in accounting policy, whereby some
Pounds 2.75m of additional commission was paid by the life division to the
financial products division.
Financial Products produced a profit of Pounds 1.06m, compared with a Pounds
1.53m loss, but overall the insurance product division reflected the lack of
activity in the estate agencies that sell its products.
Losses per share of 0.21p compared with a profit of 3.86p. There is no
interim dividend (0.5p).
COMMENT
The operational gearing of Hambro was demonstrated yesterday, when lower
than expected housing sales led brokers to slash profits forecasts from
Pounds 10m to Pounds 4m. Few dare pin any forecasts to next year. The agency
business needs to sell 50,000 houses a year to break-even, but will be hard
pushed to clear 47,000 this year. Once it has overcome that barrier, profits
will take off, and the shares are on a p/e of 58, reflecting that
possibility. But with management admitting that prospects are extremely
uncertain, the shares should only be for the speculator.

FT  26 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Farringford looking for acquisition as
losses rise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax losses at Farringford increased from Pounds 655,000 to Pounds
896,000 in the year to February 28.
Directors said current operations were inadequate to enable the company to
trade profitably. A recapitalisation and acquisition were required to secure
its future.
A number of potential acquisitions had been reviewed and an announcement to
shareholders was likely in the near future.
Sales fell to Pounds 636,000 (Pounds 654,000). An exceptional charge of
Pounds 563,000 (Pounds 317,000) related mainly to a reduction in the value
of the Farringford Hotel on the Isle of Wight, the company's main asset.
Losses per share widened to 3.6p (2.8p).

FT  26 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Securiguard input aids Rentokil -
Environmental group's organic growth of 14% disappoints analysts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rentokil more than doubled the profits of recently-acquired subsidiary
Securiguard in the first half of 1994, but it disappointed the City with
only 14 per cent growth in organic profits.
The environmental and property services group's shares fell 11 1/2 p to 222p
as it announced pre-tax profits for the period up 20 per cent to Pounds
80.6m (Pounds 67.1m).
Securiguard contributed Pounds 4.4m, after subtracting Pounds 2m of interest
costs for the Pounds 70.9m acquisition.
However, Mr Clive Thompson, chief executive, was confident that Rentokil
could continue to achieve its stated aim of 20 per cent higher profits a
year without further acquisitions.
Mr Thompson said Securiguard, the security and cleaning company, almost
doubled operating profit margins from 3.7 per cent to 7 per cent.
Rentokil has focused Securiguard on the higher value-added elements of its
business, and cut back on head office costs, and some of the less profitable
businesses.
Restructuring of the security subsidiary cost Rentokil about Pounds 500,000
in the first half, but this was covered by the previous year's provisions.
Turnover increased from Pounds 252.4m to Pounds 357m, but stripping out
Pounds 92.9m from Securiguard, growth was subdued.
The downturn in profits was exaggerated by a Pounds 900,000 loss on foreign
exchange translation.
In addition, turnover from the European division grew by only 2.9 per cent,
as sales were hit by the continuing recession. European profits expanded
from Pounds 18.8m to Pounds 20.4m.
The Asia Pacific and African operations raised profits by Pounds 3m to
Pounds 17.2m, but this progress was held back by a disappointing performance
in Australia. Calmic's Australian business was hit when senior staff left to
set up in competition.
In North America, turnover doubled to Pounds 61m and profits increased to
Pounds 7.5m (Pounds 5.2m). This figure included a first-time contribution
from Securiguard.
In the UK, profits grew by Pounds 8.1m to Pounds 34.7m, but about half of
this increase was attributable to Securiguard.
Rentokil increased its net cash reserves to Pounds 36.5m (Pounds 15.6m) and
Mr Thompson said the group was aiming to add further acquisitions to its
core businesses.
Analysts expect Rentokil to beef up its newly-acquired security operations,
which at present offer only limited geographical spread.
Mr Thompson said the company would also consider acquisitions in its other
businesses of pest control, healthcare and tropical plants.
The dividend is increased by 20 per cent from 0.84p to 1.01p, tracking a
similar advance in earnings per share from 4.39p to 5.3p.

FT  26 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Disappointing order levels restrain growth
at Weir
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Disappointing order levels in the second quarter held back Weir Group, the
pumps and engineering products company which yesterday announced a Dollars
210.5m (Pounds 136m) US acquisition partly funded by a Pounds 96m rights
issue at 252p and a 10.6 per cent increase in interim profits.
Pre-tax profits increased to Pounds 18.5m in the 26 weeks to July 1, against
Pounds 16.8m, despite a Pounds 1.3m fall in interest income to Pounds
334,000. However, the company cautioned that the comparative figure was
affected by a Pounds 2.43m exceptional charge for redundancy costs.
Earnings per share increased to 8.3p (7.4p) and the interim dividend is
raised 7 per cent from 1.925p to 2.06p.
The shares closed 2p higher at 304p although analysts expressed
disappointment about the company's flat order book. Lord Weir, chairman,
said order intake for the first quarter was strong but fell in the second
quarter.
For the first half of the year he said the order intake closely matched
turnover at Pounds 213m (Pounds 223.6m) and for 1994 as a whole he said
turnover was likely to be similar to last year's Pounds 449m.
Lord Weir said business conditions had shown little change. 'While there
remain many opportunities in the market, particularly overseas, competition
is still strong and we are not minded to take business at inadequate margins
simply for the sake of volume.
'As has been the case now for some two years, demand for spares has still to
recover to historic levels.'
Although he acknowledged that the level of order intake in the second half
was 'obviously not a helpful factor in the remainder of the year', he
expressed confidence that the group would nevertheless produce satisfactory
results and, 'a creditable performance in the circumstances'.
COMMENT
Weir had been looking for a suitable acquisition to boost its international
sales. The US acquisition was welcomed yesterday as a sensible deal at a
reasonable price. EnviroTech's products are seen as complementing Weir's
specialist engineering products and will provide the group with much
improved international sales and marketing coverage. Analysts, however, were
disappointed by the news on the order book and the group's slow growth.
Pre-tax profits should still top Pounds 39m this year, but the shares, which
are trading on a forward multiple of about 17, look fully valued compared
with others in the sector.

FT  26 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Body Shop spillage details revealed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Body Shop International, the cosmetics and toiletries group, was pursued by
local US environmental authorities in connection with four separate releases
of liquids from its New Jersey plant in the last two years.
The details of its environmental performance appear to contradict statements
it has released in the last few days as pressure has grown over its green
and ethical image.
Body Shop was responsible for at least three releases into the sewage system
which were detected initially by the local sewage authority, a senior
official of the authority said yesterday.
In a letter, published in the Financial Times on Wednesday, Mr Gordon
Roddick, Body Shop's chairman, said there had been two spills from its New
Jersey warehouse of 30 gallons of shampoo two years ago after which it
'immediately notified the authorities'.
However, documents obtained by the Financial Times show that the company
released a total of at least 62 gallons of shampoo or shower gel in three
spills, two in 1992 and another in 1993.
On each occasion, it was officials of the Hanover Sewage Authority who
identified the releases and traced them back to the Body Shop.
In another incident in 1993, Body Shop notified the authorities immediately
when sub-contractors hired while it was cleaning its warehouse emptied
adhesive remover chemicals into the system.
Mr Michael Wynne, executive director of the authority, said yesterday: 'It
should have been relatively easy for them to comply with our regulations.
They kept saying they were going to move.'
He said Body Shop provided assurances that it would improve its systems
after the first incident, but after two more it decided to issue it with a
permit.
He said he believed that the spills were readily preventable, and that there
should have been time for Body Shop to identify them and notify the
authority before its officers did.
Body Shop yesterday said it was aware of two spills totalling 60 gallons and
the release of the cleaning chemicals, but that while it was difficult to
determine the exact sequence of notification the spills were insignificant.
'We have never said we are a perfect company. This is a small incident in
the life of a worldwide company. Things like this do happen,' it said.

FT  26 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Problems in US behind fall at Willis
Corroon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A poor performance in the US depressed interim profits at Willis Corroon,
the insurance broker.
Pre-tax profits fell by 14.3 per cent to Pounds 54.1m, compared with Pounds
63.1m at the half-way stage last year. Earnings per share on continuing
operations fell by 8 per cent from 8.6p to 7.9p. The quarterly rate of
dividend, however, is maintained at 1.65p.
Brokerage and fee turnover - including discontinued operations - fell by 2
per cent to Pounds 362m (Pounds 371m). Interest and investment income fell
to Pounds 20.7m (Pounds 27.1m).
The decline was concentrated in the first quarter, when news of problems in
a number of US retail operations emerged. There were improvements in the
second quarter, with overall turnover rising by 3 per cent. Even so, over
the six months profits generated by the North American brokerage operations
fell to Pounds 1m, compared with Pounds 8.3m at the same stage of last year.
Willis attributed its US problems to 'tough market conditions and strong
competition'. In addition, business has been lost following the defection of
a number of construction risk specialists to a rival broker.
Moves to replace these staff and strengthen other parts of The North
American direct, reinsurance, and aerospace operations have increased costs,
with expenses up by 6 per cent in the continuing operations to Pounds 328m
(Pounds 308m).
Mr Roger Elliott, executive chairman, also pointed out that 'local issues'
had adversely affected some of the company's US offices and were now being
addressed.
Analysts are not convinced that management action will prove adequate,
however. 'Willis's problems appear far from over,' said Ms Julianne Jessup,
of Kleinwort Benson.
Expenses from discontinued underwriting operations amounted to Pounds 3.7m,
compared with Pounds 12m last time.
Movements in exchange rates benefited the results by Pounds 3.7m.
Share of profits of associates amounted to Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 5.3m).
Interest payable totalled Pounds 2.6m compared with Pounds 3.5m.
COMMENT
There is little in Willis Corroon's latest results to encourage investors,
who have seen the sharesmarked down sharply in recent months. Conditions in
the US retail sector remain especially tough, with competition - especially
in the the casualty market - under pressure. And following the recent
increase in expenses, the group could find that it is running simply to
stand still. On a positive note, successful hedging will offset some of the
impact of the expected weakness of the dollar. Even so, pre-tax profits for
1994 could be as low as Pounds 65m, putting the shares - at yesterday's
closing price of 153p - on a prospective multiple of 15. Despite their
recent fall, they still do not look particularly cheap.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Ladbroke to unveil return to casinos with results details
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ladbroke, the hotels, bookmakers, and DIY group, is expected to announce its
return to the UK casino market next week, 15 years after being expelled from
the business.
The group is believed to be planning to announce the acquisition of three
London casinos for about Pounds 50m when it reveals its interim results on
Thursday.
The purchase has been the subject of some speculation, with uncertainty over
approval from the Gaming Board of Ladbroke's fitness to run casinos. The
company was forced to give up its casinos in 1979 after allegations of
malpractice over its attempts to win business.
One industry source said he would be 'astonished' if the acquisition was not
unveiled on Thursday, adding that that the company would be 'stupid' to go
ahead with the acquisition unless it was confident it could get gaming board
approval.
Changes in the law since 1979 could work in Ladbroke's favour. Previously,
companies would be licensed. Now, however, individuals are licensed. The
retirement earlier this year of Mr Cyril Stein, chairman at the time of the
expulsion, leaves Ladbroke with a new management to apply for licenses.
Ladbroke is understood to be in discussions with leisure operator, Mr Trevor
Hemmings, over the exact price for his City Clubs group. It is expected to
pay at least Pounds 50m for the up-market Maximes, middle-market Golden
Horseshoe, and the popular Charlie Chester's casinos.
Analysts said this appeared to be a high price for a company with sales of
about Pounds 100m and pre-tax profits estimated at Pounds 5m.
However, the acquisition was merely a means to an end, said one analyst: 'I
have been expecting Ladbroke to overpay for a London casino for some time.'
Ladbroke's ambitions to expand in the growing international casino market
could be hindered by its chequered past. Returning to the UK market, where
the gaming regulations are seen to be strict would give the group
credibility abroad.
Analysts are expecting Ladbroke to post pre-tax profits on Thursday of about
Pounds 50m for the first half, against Pounds 62.5m last time.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Undaunted by hit to newspaper profits: A UK price war that
looks set to continue into next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News International, Mr Rupert Murdoch's main UK operating company, has set
its sights on taking The Times to a circulation of more than 1m. In a
further indication that price wars in the UK national newspaper industry are
likely to continue, Mr Gus Fischer, News International's chief executive,
said: 'Obviously we would like to push it (The Times) to the same level as
The Telegraph and beyond.'
The 20p Times has increased its circulation by more than 200,000 to its
current level of approaching 600,000 and The Daily Telegraph, after reducing
its cover price to 30p on weekdays, has increased its circulation from
993,000 to about 1.07m copies.
'We think we have proved beyond any shadow of a doubt that newspapers are
price sensitive,' Mr Fischer said yesterday. He insisted that pricing policy
would be kept continually under review.
However, in a sign that News International is growing increasingly confident
in its current pricing policy, the newspaper group - which owns five UK
national newspapers - said it was increasing its advertising rates by 15 per
cent on three of them.
The rates are increasing on both the Sun, now selling at 22p, and the Times.
The group will give advertisers a guaranteed 600,000 circulation for The
Times until the end of this year and a 4m guarantee for the Sun. The latter
is selling around 4.2m despite this week's 2p price increase. The Sun's
price was cut from 25p to 20p last summer.
Advertising rates are also increasing by 15 per cent on the News of the
World, although there is no sign that News International plans to reduce the
price of its popular Sunday tabloid or its other market-leading title, The
Sunday Times.
Although News International could give advertisers rebates if the minimum
circulation guarantees are not met, the move on rates implies that the
newspaper price war is likely to last for the rest of this year and probably
well into next.
This means continuing difficulties for The Telegraph group, which admitted
on Wednesday that its price cut had cost Pounds 1m for just the first six
days included in its latest reporting period. In addition, discount vouchers
had cost Pounds 1m and Pounds 8m had been spent on promotion.
News International's commitment to its radical pricing policy emerged as the
News Corp subsidiary announced its results for the year to the end of June.
Its operating profits of Pounds 96.2m fell Pounds 44.7m below its 1992-93
performance. The main reason for the difference was the impact of the price
cuts, but News International declined to give the precise figure
attributable to the pricing policy.
Mr Fischer said: 'The UK newspaper industry market has never been so
competitive and I can't see that changing.'
News International's turnover increased from Pounds 708.1m to Pounds 733.5m
and profit after minorities soared from Pounds 146.4m to Pounds 359.3m.
The large increase was, however, attributable to a number of non-operating
factors. A Pounds 78.6m contribution from associates came largely from
BSkyB, the satellite television venture 50 per cent owned by News Corp.
There was also a book profit of Pounds 90m on the disposal of fixed assets -
the transfer within the group, it is believed, of shares in Reuters, the
news and information group, and in Pearson, owner of the Financial Times.
Net interest income amounted to Pounds 85.9m, up from Pounds 1.6m, again
helped by transactions within the group.
Special dividend shareholders of News International will receive a final
dividend of the sterling equivalent of 1.5 Australian cents a share.

FT  26 AUG 94 / GRE doubles its trading profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Guardian Royal Exchange, the composite insurance company, provided more
evidence of the strong recovery in the UK general insurance market when it
announced interim trading profits of Pounds 131m, doubled from Pounds 65m
last year.
After taking into account net realised and unrealised investment losses of
Pounds 417m, the group reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 286m, against a
profit of Pounds 307m. Unlike its main competitors, GRE includes capital
gains and losses in its profit and loss account.
Mr John Robins, the group's new chief executive, said the decision to
increase the interim dividend by 7.5 per cent to 2.85p (2.65p) reflected
'not only the group's trading performance worldwide but also its sound
balance sheet and strong cash generation'.
A UK underwriting profit of Pounds 24m was 'the engine behind the
improvement', said Mr James Morley, finance director. Underwriting profits
of Pounds 47m, up from break-even last year, were achieved on home, motor
and other personal lines business, offsetting a Pounds 10m loss (Pounds 24m
loss) on commercial lines and a Pounds 13m loss (Pounds 16m loss) in the
London market.
Results benefited from premium rate increases, more selective underwriting
and improved claims experience. In its motor business, frequency of claims
has fallen from 30 for every 100 cars insured in 1991 to less than 25 in
June 1994.
Mr Morley said Guardian Direct, the telephone insurer launched in March,
received premium income of Pounds 2m against expenses and claims of Pounds
8m.
GRE's German operations cut its loss from Pounds 28m to Pounds 15m. Losses
were also reduced in Canada and Ireland, but increased in the US South
Africa.
Life profits rose to Pounds 13m (Pounds 11m), but the group is continuing to
reorganise its life businesses, following the loss of more than 300 jobs in
the past 12 months. Net investment income rose to Pounds 150m (Pounds 149m).
The decline in the equity and fixed income markets during the first six
months led to fall in the value of shareholders funds. These amounted to
Pounds 1.39bn by June 30, compared with Pounds 1.35bn at the same stage last
year and Pounds 1.68bn at December 31. Overall premium income amounted to
Pounds 2.01bn (Pounds 1.77bn).

FT  26 AUG 94 / BSkyB and Ansett help lift News Corp 24%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A surge in profits from its two associate companies, BSkyB and Ansett
Airlines, more than offset a small decline in earnings from core operations
at News Corporation, and allowed Mr Rupert Murdoch's media and film group to
post after-tax profits, before abnormals, of ADollars 1.21bn (Pounds 580m)
in the 12 months to June.
This was nearly 24 per cent up on the ADollars 979m made in the previous
year. Net profits after abnormals reached ADollars 1.33bn, up from ADollars
864m. This reflected a ADollars 123m gain - largely on the sale of the
group's interest in the South China Morning Post (SCMP) - compared with a
ADollars 115m charge last time. Revenues were 8.7 per cent higher at
ADollars 11.6bn.
Much of the improvement came from the two associates, whose combined
contribution to profits more than doubled from ADollars 177m to ADollars
394. Ansett, the Australian airline owned jointly by News Corp and TNT, saw
operating profits almost quadruple, while passenger volume rose by more than
13 per cent.
The airline attributed the improvement to increased business travel, better
yield management, advertising and cost control. BSkyB, the satellite
broadcaster in which News has a 50 per cent stake and where Pearson,
publisher of the Financial Times, also has a stake, saw operating profits
rise 170 per cent.
News Corp's figures were also helped by a ADollars 70m drop in interest
charges, to ADollars 667m, as a debt reduction and rescheduling programme
continued.
Operating profits from core operations were 6.2 per cent lower at ADollars
1.6bn, with strong increases on the film and television side offset by
declines in newspapers and magazines/inserts. The latter was due to the
newspaper price war in the UK, which cut operating profits there by 37 per
cent; to the sale of the SCMP interest; to higher than expected start-up
costs at a new Melbourne printing facility; and to competitive pressure in
the coupon industry.
Overall, the newspapers division made operating profits of ADollars 436m,
against ADollars 671m, while magazines and inserts contributed ADollars
339m, against ADollars 402m.
By contrast, the film division multiplied operating profits to ADollars
141m, from ADollars 53m, while television made ADollars 466m against
ADollars 373m. The book publishing side produced ADollars 208m.
Earnings per share, based on profits after outside equity interests but
before abnormal items, rose 12.3 per cent to 64 cents.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Weir pays Dollars 210m for US pump maker: Group announces
Pounds 96m one-for-four rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Weir Group, the Glasgow-based pumps and engineering group, is paying Dollars
210m (Pounds 136m) to acquire EnviroTech Pumpsystems, a leading US
manufacturer of specialist pumps.
The acquisition will be partly funded through a proposed one-for-four rights
issue of about 39.3m shares at 252p each to raise Pounds 96m after expenses.
The rights issue has been fully underwritten by Morgan Grenfell. The balance
of the purchase price will be in cash and the enlarged group will have
little or no gearing.
The group announced a 10.6 per cent increase in first-half pre-tax profits
yesterday to Pounds 18.5m (Pounds 16.8m) but admitted that orders in the
second quarter had fallen off from the strong first quarter. Weir Group
shares closed 2p higher at 304p.
EnviroTech, a pump manufacturing group headquartered in Salt Lake City,
Utah, is part of the Baker Hughes group.
In the year to September 30, EnviroTech reported pre-tax profits of Dollars
21.7m on sales of Dollars 220.5m with net assets of Dollars 98.3m.
Weir has been looking for an acquisition which would improve the
international balance of its pump business which had sales last year of
Pounds 180m.
Lord Weir, chairman, said the purchase would enable the group to expand into
a truly international business with a combined turnover of about Pounds
330m.
He added that it would offer the group an improved marketing and
manufacturing capability worldwide and give the group's pump operations
important critical mass.
The combined pump business will represent about 55 per cent of the enlarged
group's sales and will increase Weir's presence in the important North
American market and expand its operations in most other regions. Lord Weir
said the deal should enhance earnings in 1995.
The US group, which employs about 2,000 people, also has plants in
California and Missouri and operations in the UK, continental Europe, South
America, Africa, Australia and Canada.
Its main worldwide markets are the mining and mineral processing, chemicals
and refining, water and waste water, power and utilities and pulp and paper.
Last year the US gave rise to 44.2 per cent of its operating revenues,
Europe 25.9 per cent, Africa 14.3 per cent, South America 11.1 per cent and
Asia/Pacific 4.5 per cent.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Clinton wins vital Senate support for Dollars 30bn crime
bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton won a crucial victory yesterday when Democrats and
moderate Republicans in the Senate united to pass a procedural motion paving
the way for a vote on the controversial Dollars 30bn (Pounds 19.3bn) crime
bill.
If the bill is approved in a final vote, the president will get a
much-needed boost as he struggles to revive his flagging political standing
ahead of mid-term Congressional elections in November. Senators were poised
last night to vote in further stages of the legislative process.
The crime bill, which was passed by the House of Representatives on Sunday,
has seemed in danger of being lost through procedural wrangling in the
Senate.
But the president's supporters mustered 61 votes - just one more than
necessary under the rules - to get the bill over a critical initial hurdle.
Six Republicans joined 55 Democrats to push the bill ahead, while 38
Republicans and one Democrat were opposed.
After a final vote is taken on the crime bill, the Senate will adjourn for
two weeks, but behind-the-scenes efforts will try to make progress on
healthcare - Mr Clinton's other big legislative goal.
The crime bill would provide funding over six years for new prisons, extra
police and social programmes aimed at preventing people from turning to
crime.
The crime bill has been caught up in blocking manoeuvres by the Republicans
with an eye to the looming elections. Last year a similar bill passed the
Senate by a wide margin of 95-4, with only two Republicans in opposition.
That bill went to a House-Senate conference committee, where differences
between the House and Senate versions were ironed out. But when the bill
returned for a final vote, it nearly failed in the House and has run into
strong Republican blocking tactics in the Senate.
Republican Senators have tried to eliminate the social programmes from the
bill. But Democrats have accused them of acting on behalf of the powerful
gun lobby, which wants the bill killed because it contains a ban on assault
weapons.
The crime bill was intended as a showcase for Mr Clinton's brand of moderate
government activism. It contains items to appeal to various constituencies:
new death penalties, tougher sentencing laws, incentives for the hiring of
100,000 new policemen, and prison funding - all intended to appeal to the
political right; crime prevention programmes for the political left; and the
assault weapons ban to demonstrate that Washington is not in the grip of
'special interests'.
On the Senate floor yesterday, the Democratic leader, Senator George
Mitchell, begged his colleagues to 'resist the temptation to take a
political action' by opposing the bill.
The lengthy wrangling over the crime bill has held up Senate action on
healthcare reforms and some Democrats claim that is the real purpose of the
Republican tactics.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Sharp drop in sales of life and pension policies: Fall
blamed partly on concern over mis-selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of new life assurance and pension products fell sharply in the first
half of this year, according to figures published yesterday by the
Association of British Insurers.
The trade association attributed the decline to public concern about the
mis-selling of personal pensions, the flat condition of the mortgage market
and low UK interest rates.
The ABI figures showed sharp falls in the regular premium life and pensions
policies sold in the second quarter compared with the same period of 1993.
The number of regular premium life policies fell below 1m, while the number
of regular premium pensions slipped to 264,000 - both at their lowest
quarterly levels for well over two years.
Figures for single premium pensions confirmed the impact on sales of the
decision by the Securities and Investments Board, the chief City regulator,
last December to set up a review of the selling of personal pensions to
people transferring out of an occupational scheme.
The number of single premium pensions sold in the first half of this year,
265,000, was 30 per cent below the number sold in the first half of last
year, and 40 per cent below the total sold in the first six months of 1992.
The ABI said if the uncertainties relating to the SIB review were resolved
'swiftly and satisfactorily' and the economy continued to improve, new
premium income from pensions for the full year would exceed Pounds 4.5bn and
could be closer to the Pounds 6.2bn generated last year.
The prospect of a speedy conclusion to work arising from the SIB review is,
however, unlikely. The SIB's report on how to compensate people who have
suffered from having followed poor advice has already been delayed until
October. Compensating them is likely to take many months.
Overall, life insurance was hit harder than pensions business, with the low
interest rates reflected in low rates available on annuities causing a drop
of more than half in the new premium income from annuity business, the ABI
said.
Alongside consumers' reluctance to make a long-term commitment to a savings
plan, regular premium life policies had been affected by the relatively flat
state of the housing market and the impact of this on the sale of
mortgage-related endowment policies. But the falls in the numbers of
policies taken out have not had such a marked impact on new premium income
because of larger amounts being invested.
Mr Tony Baker, the ABI's deputy director-general, also highlighted the
development of more flexible policies to meet customers' changing demands,
and the steady sales of policies linked to equity investments.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Privatised utilities could face more legal challenges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Privatised utilities, including the water companies, British Gas and British
Telecommunications, were yesterday left more exposed to legal challenges
over a wide range of issues after the High Court ruled that South West Water
operates under 'state control'.
The ruling suggests that all privatised utilities, unlike other public
limited companies, will be required to implement European Commission
directives, even when these have not been incorporated into UK law.
This was seen by lawyers as giving employees and pressure groups extra scope
to mount legal challenges against the former state-owned industries by
claiming possible breaches of EU directives.
These could include challenges over issues covered by EU directives such as
employment and environmental concerns.
Ms Melanie Tether, an employment partner with Norton Rose, the London law
firm, said the ruling would affect the position of all the privatised
utilities.
'Undoubtedly a judgment of this kind will be welcomed by employees in this
kind of organisation. It will have widespread implications.'
The government had recently increased the pace of legislation bringing UK
law into line with European directives, so lessening to some degree the
difficulties posed to utilities by the ruling, Ms Tether pointed out.
However, with new directives continuing to emerge from Europe, the issue
would still be a 'moveable feast' for the courts, she said.
The ruling followed an attempt by Unison, the public services union, to
challenge redundancies planned by South West Water.
Although Unison lost the bulk of its case, the judge, Mr Justice Blackburne,
ruled that despite South West Water's status as a plc, it was an 'emanation
of the state' because it provided a public service controlled by a
state-appointed regulator.
The judge said: 'The question is not whether the body in question is under
the control of the state, but whether the public service in question is
under the control of the state.
'The legal form of the body is irrelevant. The fact that the body is a
commercial concern is also irrelevant. It is also irrelevant that the body
does not carry out any of the traditional functions of the state and is not
an agent of the state. It is irrelevant too that the state does not possess
day-to-day control over the activities of the body.'
British Gas and BT declined to comment on yesterday's ruling. South West
Water has not indicated if it will appeal.

FT  26 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Slough Estates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a sure sign of confidence returning to the property market that Slough
Estates is cranking up its development programme. Slough can hardly be
counted among the sector's high-rollers. Its decision to increase the pace
of development rests on the first hints of increased interest from potential
tenants, at least in better quality buildings. While headline rents show no
sign of rising - and are still falling for lesser quality space - there is
evidence that fewer incentives are required to persuade tenants to sign on
the dotted line.
If that trend continues investors will breathe a sigh of relief. The rise in
property values since the bottom in 1991 has relied on falling bond yields.
Yet recent survey evidence suggests that this year's turbulent bond markets
are starting to drag property values down. Sure signs of rental growth will
be required if property is to be anything other than a hostage to gilts.
Property companies also need higher occupation rates and modest rental
growth to keep profits moving ahead. Much of the improvement in Slough's
half year profits arose from lower interest costs as a result of its rights
issue. There will be additional benefits to come as the rights money is used
to expand the portfolio. But, like the other property companies which asked
shareholders for funds last year, that momentum will only carry Slough so
far. The green shoots of rental growth cannot come soon enough.

FT  26 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Guardian Royal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a measure of the cyclical nature of insurance that a decade ago
Guardian Royal Exchange was vying with Royal to be the sector's most highly
valued company. Decisions to expand in Italy and build up the UK motor
business at the wrong moment put paid to such ambitions. Its market
capitalisation is now little more than half Commercial Union's, which was
itself the sector laggard in the mid-1980s. If the lesson is that insurance
companies benefit from a period of retrenchment, one might wonder whether
the tables will be turned again in 10 years time.
Yet the stock market remains suspicious that Guardian is trying to make up
lost ground too quickly. Premium income in the first half was 15 per cent
higher than in the same period last year - a faster growth rate than its
peers. Once accounting and reinsurance changes are stripped out, though,
premium growth is a less frightening 11 per cent. And the modest
acquisitions which account for 4 percentage points of the increase look
sensible. Buying US expertise in non-standard automotive risks, for example,
could bear fruit in other countries. There is also the potential for cost
savings.
Besides, Guardian made an operating profit in all the countries in which it
operates in the first half. That hardly smacks of slack management. With a
solvency ratio of around 50 per cent, the balance sheet is strong enough to
support growth and still deliver a decent return on shareholders' funds. On
that measure, Guardian is outperforming most of its peers.

FT  26 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Rentokil
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Given its remarkable record and self-confident management Rentokil's figures
are rightly given a very thorough going over by the City. Yesterday's
interims were found wanting. It was not merely that the group met its
long-standing target of 20 per cent earnings growth by the merest whisker.
It was the underlying improvement that caused concern. Excluding the
excellent contribution from Securiguard, earnings would have risen by around
14 per cent, positively pedestrian by Rentokil's standards.
In continental Europe recession bit deeper than expected. But in Australia
Rentokil had only itself to blame and, while the management problems have
been tackled, it will take some time for the benefits to work through. In
contrast the figures from Securiguard were very encouraging and should lay
to rest any lingering doubts about the acquisition. The swift improvement in
margins to 6.9 per cent suggests it was right to argue there is a market for
high quality security services. The company's confidence that margins can
reach into double figures within two years looks well-founded. Its success
also provides a new business area into which Rentokil can funnel its
mounting cash pile through bolt-on acquisitions.
The results should not undermine investor confidence in Rentokil's prospects
and, after yesterday's fall, the share rating is near its low relative to
the market. Yet the premium is still almost 30 per cent and, as the reaction
to the last figures in March showed, the market takes a while to get over a
disappointment.

FT  26 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: News stands the pain
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Any media investors hoping for a quick end to the UK newspaper price war
will be disappointed. News International's decision to raise by 15 per cent
the advertising rates on The Times and The Sun is a clear sign that the
battle for market share has many rounds to go. The rate increases are
contingent on The Sun's and The Times' circulations staying above 4m and
600,000 respectively, which could not be guaranteed if cover prices were put
up. Having suffered a Pounds 45m drop in operating profits in the year to
end-June, it makes sense for News International to hang on for the benefits.
Not only will advertising revenues rise, but the growth in sales will lead
to a rebound in circulation revenues.
Mr Murdoch can also take grim satisfaction from the pain he is causing
rivals. The Telegraph's cover price cut has stemmed its loss of market
share, but this week's 12 per cent fall in pre-tax profits was worse than
analysts expected. All Mr Conrad Black, chairman of the Telegraph, could say
was that he was looking forward to the challenge posed by the price war.
Meanwhile, results from elsewhere in Mr Murdoch's empire show how well he
can stand the pain. The contribution from News International's 50 per cent
stake in BSkyB trebled to Pounds 79m. Fears that the satellite group was
running out of momentum appear unfounded. The other TV interests of News
Corporation, the parent group, are also picking up. There are signs that Fox
Network's Dollars 1.6bn investment in American football rights is paying
off, while the losses from his Asian satellite venture were a modest Dollars
20m. Nothing suggests that Mr Murdoch either wishes or needs to change tack.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Santer plans wide-ranging reforms to open up Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Santer, incoming president of the European Commission, is
planning a more open, less autocratic style of leadership as well a
wide-ranging internal shake-up when he succeeds Mr Jacques Delors next
January.
Officials close to him say he intends to introduce a more collegial
approach, ending Mr Delors' practice of concentrating power in an inner
circle and creating an underground network in the bureaucracy.
Mr Santer, who has been commuting between his native Luxembourg and
Brussels, intends to outline ideas on reforming the Commission during a
forthcoming tour of European capitals.
Originally dismissed as a safe but uninspiring choice to succeed Mr Delors,
the long-time Luxembourg prime minister wants to shape his own team and
reorganise the Commission in preparation for his five-year term starting on
January 6. His task is harder because of delays by member states in putting
forward candidates for commissioners and rivalry over portfolios. In France,
the Gaullist-led coalition is finding it hard to pin down President Francois
Mitterrand, a Socialist, on suitable candidates. Mrs Edith Cresson, a former
prime minister and Mitterrand favourite, would be welcomed as a political
heavyweight - though French claims to the external trade portfolio are being
resisted by the UK which wants Sir Leon Brittan to retain it.
Brussels officials are also worried that referendums on European Union
membership to be held in Finland, Sweden, and Norway could force delays in
agreeing a division of the Commission spoils. 'If we carve up the jobs
before the referendums, we could be accused of treating the Scandinavians
like second-class citizens,' said one.
If EU enlargement goes ahead, the number of Commissioners will rise from 17
to 21 (including Austria). Mr Santer is said to be confident enough work can
be found, but others are doubtful.
An early test will be whether Mr Santer unscrambles one of Mr Delors' most
important innovations: the creation in 1992 of a commissioner for external
political affairs running a new department called DG1A. Mr Hans van den
Broek, the present incumbent, has spent much of the past 18 months scrapping
with Sir Leon Brittan who runs external trade, but the Dutchman may leave
Brussels next year.
Many officials believe Mr Delors created the portfolio in order to grab
powers over EU foreign policy which he failed to gain during the 1991
negotiations leading to the Maastricht treaty. The creation of DG1A
antagonised sovereignty-conscious France and the UK, but scrapping it could
trigger fears about an overmighty Sir Leon.
Some officials argue that Mr Santer must switch around portfolios in order
to stamp his authority on the new Commission. This would mean moving Sir
Leon from trade, the popular Mr Karel Van Miert from competition policy, and
Mr Martin Bangemann, the German industry commissioner. But Mr Santer seems
likely to reject this argument.
Instead, he is expected to press hard to restore power to the
director-generals, the international civil servants whose power was often
usurped by the private staff in the cabinets of Mr Delors and other powerful
commissioners.

When Brian Mulroney, the ex-Canadian prime minister, joined the board of
Peter Munk's American Barrick, the feisty North American gold producer, it
looked like the Hungarian-born entrepreneur was just adding another trophy
name to his letterhead.
However, word is Mulroney has been earning his keep. He has been jetting
around the world on American Barrick business introducing executives to the
president of Bolivia and opening doors in China. Indeed, an awe-struck
Barrick official recounts how Mulroney called him from Russia this week to
find out how the bid for Lac Minerals was going. Mulroney was asked whether
he was speaking from a secure line. It could hardly be more secure, was the
response: 'Boris Yeltsin is in the room next door.'
However, one member of Barrick team who doesn't seem to have been earning
his keep is Munk's highly-paid new spin-doctor, David Wynne-Morgan, the
former head of Hill &amp; Knowlton's European operations, hired two months ago.
Since then Munk has done two of his most ambitious deals - Horsham's bid for
a chunk of Trizec and now Lac Minerals - and Wynne-Morgan has missed most of
the action.
The excuse seems to be that his contract doesn't start till September 1 and
anyway he has been in touch with Munk from Italy and from the QEII where he
has been lecturing passengers.
Better check the fine print in those share options, Morgan.

The dismissal of Chung Myung-whun as music director of Paris's Opera
Bastille is causing a furore back in his home country of South Korea. His
compatriots regard the sacking as an insult to their national honour, even
though Chung is now a US citizen.
One Seoul newspaper has suggested Korea retaliates by cancelling its
contract to buy French high-speed trains, while the ministry of culture has
lodged a protest with the French embassy.
More cannily, the Korean government hopes to exploit the fracas by using it
to get France to return ancient royal Korean documents, removed to Paris a
century ago by a French military expedition. Chung's case will be sacrificed
if the papers are returned; in which case his next performance will no doubt
be The Miraculous Mandarin.

It's been a busy month for Lord Mishcon, the 79-year-old Labour peer. What
with acting on behalf of Lord Palumbo in a trust fund spat with two children
from his first marriage; helping Lady Diana in her mission impossible; and
finally assisting Lord Archer in his difficulties with Anglia TV shares,
Mishcon can't have had much of a summer break.
Oddly enough, Anglia TV used to be a client of Lord Mishcon's firm. When
Victor Mishcon merged with partners from Bartletts, de Reya in February 1988
 -forming Mishcon de Reya - one of the clients brought along by Bartletts
was Anglia TV which, since 1987 as the whole world by now knows, has
numbered among its non-executive directors Mary Doreen Archer; though Anglia
TV now gets its advice elsewhere.
The Palumbo-Mishcon-Archer network goes back to 1974, when Jeffrey Archer
was seriously strapped for cash. Archer's friend, Peter Palumbo, offered
Archer the services of his solicitor, Mishcon, who dissuaded Archer from
declaring himself bankrupt. 'Without that gift I'd have gone under,' Archer
said recently. The rest, as they say, is history.

Bonk came into the world to cheer up the people of the small town of Nystad

Since then the bonk craze has swept the country. Helio now has 10 assistants

FT  26 AUG 94 / Leading Article: China's next revolution
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There can be no turning back. After a 15-year roller-coaster of market-led
economic growth, China is set on a path which will change it from a largely
agrarian society to an urban one. The report prepared for the government by
the National Academy of Social Sciences makes that aspect of China's future
clear enough. What the country's rulers appear to see less clearly is that
they must change with it.
Many of the changes in China which the Academy expects to occur over the
next few decades are already well under way. By 2010, the study predicts
that half the population will live in towns, compared to 28 per cent today.
Twelve years ago, the proportion was barely 10 per cent. It was the poverty
afflicting the remainder, in the countryside, which drove the government's
first moves towards liberalisation in 1979, when it freed most of the rural
goods markets. Yet the steady marketisation of the rest of the economy in
the years which followed is still causing mass migration which the country's
rulers struggle vainly to control. With urban incomes some two and a half
times rural ones in 1992, it is not hard to see why.
The mushrooming of the towns and cities has made the cracks in China's new
economic structure worryingly apparent. The current distribution network ill
serves the cities' growing demand for basic staples. A large part of the
22.7 per cent increase in urban consumer prices in the year to July was due
to rising food prices. These, in turn, were the natural consequence of the
government's erratic attempts to lift its last remaining price controls on
essential foodstuffs.
Rapid urbanisation
Conclusively lifting the restrictions on food prices is a necessary, but by
no means sufficient, element of any attempt to manage China's rapid
urbanisation. Artificially low food prices can only fuel faster migration,
thus adding to the strains on the system. Agricultural prices fell by more
than a third relative to industrial ones over the period 1988-93; the recent
rise is a necessary correction. Unfortunately for the government, it is not
a popular one: rising food prices and shortages threaten to cause
considerable urban unrest, not least because traders, both wholesalers and
retailers, exploit the situation with capitalist ingenuity.
The problem is symptomatic of China's structural growing pains as it
continues a second decade of double-digit economic growth. So, too, is the
government's reaction. At the root of the disquiet in the cities is the fact
that the distribution system which takes food to the cities is grossly
under-developed, while the zeal for profit at different stages of the chain
is rather more mature.
Reference prices
In addition to sporadic injections of extra food supplies, the government
has tried to address the issue by re-introducing 'reference prices' for
staple food items, with penalties for those who charge more. An official
statement this week promised to monitor retailers even more vigorously. At
the same time, officials have declared that the government will henceforth
take a stronger role in distributing food from country to town, in order to
improve supplies and stabilise prices.
Both policies are misguided. The government cannot prevent traders from
taking advantage of goods shortages in the cities. Nor can it hope to mimic
the market efficiently if it takes a more active role in the wholesale
sector. A deeper, more competitive market in the distribution of food and
other goods is less, not more, likely to develop while government
intervention is so unpredictably heavy-handed. Such a command and control
manner of regulating economic problems is ill-suited to China today.
The government's role in the market economy which China is rapidly becoming
may have to be more laisser faire, but this does not leave it nothing to do.
Markets must operate, not according to 'reference prices', but a framework
of legal rules. Ultimately, it is the lack of such a framework which fuels
the micro-economic resentment of profiteering and the macroeconomic
instability which trouble China today. This is the challenge of the future
which China's government must face: using yesterday's methods to tackle the
symptoms is no solution.

FT  26 AUG 94 / The bear has a sore head: Russia's healthcare system faces
collapse. Linda Bilmes and John Lindquist examine the political struggle
over reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LINDA BILMES and JOHN LINDQUIST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the healthcare debate in Washington nears a climax, an equally fierce
struggle is getting under way in Moscow. Faced with a growing public health
crisis, President Boris Yeltsin issued a decree requesting the Russian
ministry of privatisation to tackle healthcare. Its proposals are now being
debated in the health committee of the duma (lower house of parliament); if
implemented, they will result in radical market-based reforms.
If one thing has brought home to Russians the disastrous decline in their
economy over the past three years, it is the near-collapse in the country's
public health system. Since 1992, male life expectancy has fallen from 63 to
59 years - 14 years below the average in countries belonging to the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Rising infant
mortality, and a jump in stress-related deaths such as heart attacks,
alcohol poisoning, as well as suicide and homicide, are all responsible for
the decline. In addition, infectious diseases almost forgotten in the west,
such as diphtheria and typhoid, have become common. Last year, for the first
time since the second world war, more Russians died than were born.
'Russia's trends since 1991,' says demographic expert Mr Nicholas Eberstadt
of the American Enterprise Institute, 'have been very much like a country
convulsed by war.'
The public health crisis follows a precipitous drop in spending. Funding for
healthcare in Russia was already low by international standards - about 3
per cent of gross domestic product compared with 6 per cent in the UK and 12
per cent in the US. For the past two decades that 3 per cent has been
misspent, thanks to financial incentives which reward inefficiency and poor
treatment. Over the 12 months of 1991, however, real healthcare spending
dropped by 39 per cent. Despite the introduction of employer-paid compulsory
medical insurance, real expenditure in 1994 is still expected to be at least
10 per cent below 1991 levels.
Lack of money has led to a freeze on capital investment, at a time when the
condition of most Russian hospitals is appalling. A quarter lacks sewer
connections, a fifth is without central heating, and nearly half does not
even have a bath or shower on the premises. One leading hospital in Moscow
has resorted to putting cats into the operating theatres to control mice and
vermin.
These problems are set to worsen. Russian enterprises, which have
traditionally provided a decent quality of healthcare for employees and
their familes, are getting rid of 'social assets' such as hospital beds to
compete more effectively in the new market economy. They have already
reduced their share of beds from 10 per cent to less than 3 per cent of the
total, and will soon begin to phase out their 'polyclinics' (which combine
general practitioners and specialists).
One of the most serious aspects of the crisis is the drastic reduction in
the supply of essential drugs. In 1992, Russia produced 59 per cent of its
requirements for cardiovascular drugs, with most of the remainder imported
cheaply from eastern Europe. By 1993, Russia produced only a third of these
drugs and due to hard currency imports met only 65 per cent of total demand.
Because of the collapse of distribution, the ministry of health estimates
that 45 per cent of demand for basic drugs will go unfilled.
The result is the rapid development of a black market in healthcare. Prices
are quoted freely for most procedures; you can pay a set fee (to a hospital
official, doctor, or even a worker in the laundry) to jump waiting lists for
operations; and even children and pensioners, who are supposed to receive
free medicine, must pay for the most basic drugs. Doctors supplement their
official salaries of Pounds 100 per month with under-the-table payments from
patients. In the case of specialists, these payments can increase their
earnings as much as tenfold. Almost every hospital service can require a
'tip' - even a bedpan has its price.
Reformers have now placed healthcare at the top of Russia's political
agenda. They blame the communist system for a legacy of poor healthcare,
while hardliners see the current crisis as a byproduct of reform. 'Our
opponents will try to use this issue for a fantastic political battle
between communist politicians and reformers,' says deputy privatisation
minister Mr Dmitri Vasiliev, one of the architects of Russia's privatisation
programme. 'But if we can find a mechanism to improve quality, it will be a
major political advantage, showing that reformers can improve people's
lives.'
Ironically, among Mr Yeltsin's most intransigent opponents to reform of the
system are the communists who run the ministry of health. Already bruised by
decentralisation measures three years ago, and reluctant to give up more
power, the ministry has failed to offer any plan for improvement.
Consequently it is the privatisation ministry which has become the driving
force of reform.
Its draft 'Law on Privatisation of Health Facilities, Pharmacies, Medical
Supplies and Pharmaceutical Industries' would enable healthcare providers to
choose one of three routes: they could become non-profit organisations,
limited partnerships, or joint stock companies. The proposals would not
completely privatise healthcare providers but would permit them to become
semi-private hybrids with greater autonomy. The idea is to enable hospitals
to become a Russian version of the UK's National Health Service Trusts, run
and managed by doctors, with the land and buildings leased from the state.
The Trust could seek partners in the private sector, among companies
affiliated with the medical sector (drug companies, medical insurers,
equipment suppliers).
In polyclincs, the aim is to introduce greater competition and patient
choice. For example, individual doctors would be able to set up on their own
as general practitioners. Polyclinics could also opt for one of the
privatisation routes. The duma would need to pass legislation to enable
non-profit organisations to be created.
The new law would require the new healthcare entity to pledge to provide
free healthcare to the local population, maintain capacity, and provide
training as required by the ministry of health.
In the pharmaceutical industry the government is likely to retain a
controlling stake for the time being. Pharmacies, wholesalers, and
manufacturers of drugs and medical equipment would be privatised, according
to the existing laws on state-owned assets, already applied in most other
sectors of the economy. This aspect of the privatisation ministry's plan is
a crucial step in helping to unblock the supply of drugs. Similar
privatisation measures among food wholesalers increased the supply of fresh
vegetables by up to 40 per cent.
The ministry believes that by introducing market mechanisms, health
providers will have an incentive to rectify problems such as excessive
hospitalisation (the average length of stay in hospital is about 22 days),
little attention to screening and disease prevention, and unsympathetic,
surly care. However, this is the first time that it has attempted to apply
market forces to a social service. 'Our approach to privatisation in the
social sphere fundamentally differs from the material one in its aims and
objectives,' says Mr Vasiliev. 'We want to provide better services to the
population, and the basic means to achieve this is by introducing
competition.'
Mr Vasiliev admits that the privatisation ministry's current thinking is
'very very rough'. But he is adamant any new healthcare system must
guarantee universal access and special protection for children, pensioners,
and needy groups. 'In truth, rich people can pay but the system doesn't work
at all for the majority of people,' says Mr Vasiliev.
Ms Natasha Sipiashvili, a ministry representatives on the duma health
committee, says the draft proposals will be discussed in committee during
the autumn. 'In our experience,' she says, 'the duma won't refuse to discuss
a controversial topic. They just won't move forward. But in this case,
President Yeltsin himself is interested, so the discussions are likely to
receive attention.' The ministry aims to secure the enactment of a
healthcare reform bill by next year.
One complication is finance. Russia is still struggling to implement a 1991
law which decentralised healthcare funding to the regions and introduced
compulsory medical insurance - a 3.6 per cent payroll tax paid by employers.
The insurance scheme was supposed to become a significant source of revenue
but it has not. According to Dr John LeSar, who has just completed two years
as director of environment and health for the US Agency for International
Development in Moscow, 'the main problem is the complete lack of skills in
the insurance sector, and in contracting, building statistical databases on
costs, and managing the funds and transfers. Also, the system is seriously
underfunded.'
In the first half of 1994, compulsory medical insurance funds covered 20 per
cent to 50 per cent of official health expenditure, varying by region, with
the remainder financed by local and national government. However, the tax is
garnering only 70 per cent or less of expected revenues. According to a
study by the Boston Consulting Group, even if yields could be increased to
95 per cent, it would require a 20 per cent boost in local government
spending, or an increase in the tax to 5 per cent, to restore Russia's
healthcare spending to 1991 levels. 'Without changing the financial
picture,' says Mr Vasiliev, 'it will not be possible to accomplish our
objectives.'
The conservative duma, facing elections in December next year, will be
watching public opinion closely. At present, opinion is finely balanced. In
a recent nationwide poll, 55 per cent of respondents said they were not
satisfied with healthcare in Russia (29 per cent were satisfied); the reason
most frequently cited is the shortage of medicine. One the other hand, 54
per cent of respondents agreed with the statement that 'the healthcare
system in Russia is basically sound and the problems are only temporary',
and 52 per cent agreed that 'allowing individuals and businesses to run the
healthcare system will only make healthcare unaffordable for most Russians.'
Nevertheless, both the public and the medical profession seem willing to
give market forces a try. In a separate survey, seven out of 10 doctors said
that 'competition among healthcare providers would result in better care at
lower costs'. And 78 per cent of the healthcare profession support the Trust
hospitals idea. Among the public, 55 per cent say they would happily go to
such Trust hospitals, regardless of whether they are non-profit or
profit-making.
Perhaps the most striking result in the nationwide poll is the extent to
which Russians are worrying about the future of their healthcare system.
Fully 70 per cent of poll respondents say they worry 'a great deal' that
they 'might be required to pay' for their family's basic care. This figure
cuts across all regional and demographic lines, and rises to 81 per cent who
worry about their ability to pay for a catastrophic illness.
'If I look at the situation in healthcare, and I look at the poll numbers,
and I look at the lack of any credible alternatives, this issue looks like a
clear winner for the reformers,' says Professor Jonathan Hay, an adviser to
the privatisation minister Mr Anatoly Chubais.
The reformers must convince the public that Russia's healthcare problems
stem from years of communist ineptitude: not simply the poor economy. As Mr
Eberstadt points out: 'It's not inevitable economic crisis leads to
healthcare crisis. When Latin America and the Caribbean had a debt crisis,
and their economic output dropped by a third, their levels of mortality did
not just shoot through the roof.'
Some government officials fear that communists and anti-reformers will seize
upon the public's anxiety over healthcare and turn it to their advantage.
'People's anxiety is not organised or vocalised at present,' says Dr LeSar,
'but could easily become so, if the anti-reform movement took up the issue.
All it would take is a catalyst: somebody being turned away from a
privatised clinic, or a cholera epidemic, for this to become an organised
protest.'
With reports of cholera at a Moscow railway station, and confirmed cases in
the south of Russia, there is no doubt that the stakes for the reformers are
high. It is ironic that in both the US and Russia, with vastly different
healthcare systems and approaches to medicine, public health has risen to
the political forefront at the same time. With presidential elections set
for 1996 in both countries, the healthcare issue is unlikely to go away.

government on healthcare reform

FT  26 AUG 94 / Leading Article: A qualified success story
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The first results for the new advanced-level General National Vocational
Qualifications (GNVQs), announced yesterday, deserve at least a qualified
welcome. They suggest that the government might have found the right vehicle
for delivering desperately needed improvements to the UK's skills base.
It is not before time. By international standards, Britain's record on
vocational training is appalling. According to the National Institute of
Economic and Social Research, 64 per cent of Britain's workforce has no
vocational qualifications. In Germany, this figure is only 26 per cent. In
that light yesterday's news that at least 50,000 16-year-olds will be
embarking on the new qualifications next month, and that the pioneer
students who took the two-year pilot enjoyed more success looking for
university places than rivals with academic A-levels, is encouraging.
This was exactly the intention. Advanced GNVQs, referred to by ministers as
'vocational A-levels' are broader than national vocational qualifications
(NVQs), which are meant to be taken in the workplace and commit trainees to
narrower fields such as plumbing and bricklaying. By contrast GNVQs are
offered in subjects such as 'manufacturing' and 'health and social care'.
Successful GNVQ candidates can use their qualifications either to apply to
university or to move into the world of work.
Employers impressed
Employers may well be impressed by the fact that only a third of the
candidates who set out on pilot GNVQ courses two years ago completed them.
On this year's evidence, the qualification cannot be dismissed as a soft
option. But so much weight has been put on the qualifications that further
improvement is still necessary. The Department for Education appears to have
recognised this, and has presented the bodies which award GNVQs with a
six-point series of reforms. It is imperative that they are implemented if
the respect of universities and employers is to be maintained.
Ministers want tougher objective testing, better training for external
verifiers, and clearer grading. At present, with most coursework being
assessed by colleges funded in part according to their students' success
rate, there is a worrying potential conflict of interest. The pilot scheme
was heavily policed by government inspectors, who passed the results with a
clean bill of health, but much more rigorous internal checks and balances
will be needed.
Theoretical grounding
The education department also wants clarification of what knowledge is
needed for a GNVQ. Without this, GNVQs might fall victim to a problem which
has bedevilled NVQs, which are designed to test candidates' competences,
rather than their knowledge. Critics complain that this produces trainees
without sufficient theoretical grounding in basic mathematical and
scientific principles. And as a result the government is now spending Pounds
31m on a review of the structure and content of all existing NVQs.
In continental European training schemes, vocational courses are studied
alongside discretely taught general education courses, in mathematics and
language. Such basic skills should be explicitly required in GNVQs, and
tested independently.
Ultimately, the government's problems concerning both assessment and
knowledge can be solved by reforming A-Levels, so that more subjects can be
studied - a move which ministers regrettably refuse to consider. This would
allow GNVQ candidates to gain the right basic skills by taking separate
A-levels in maths, sciences or foreign languages as appropriate.
The remaining question-marks over assessment of GNVQs could be removed by
making them conform to the same assessment criteria as practical A-level
subjects such as art, where roughly 40 per cent of work is externally
assessed and other coursework is left for teachers to assess. GNVQs would
then carry just as strong a guarantee of impartial marking as the widely
respected A-level.
But all of this is in the future. For now, the awarding bodies must ensure
that the government's list of reforms is fully enacted. If they do this,
they will deserve unqualified praise.

FT  26 AUG 94 / A damaging diversion: Rows over Pakistan's nuclear
capability will not help attempts to bring stability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An admission this week by Mr Nawaz Sharif, former Pakistani prime minister,
that his country has the atomic bomb comes at a difficult time for Pakistan.
Following soon after reports from Germany that Pakistan is a possible
destination for plutonium smuggled out of the former Soviet Union, Mr
Sharif's claim will heighten international concern about Pakistan's nuclear
programme.
It has also inflamed relations with Pakistan's arch-enemy India, which are
already tense because of the territorial dispute over the troubled region of
Kashmir and because of Indian allegations that Pakistani secret service
agents helped organise terrorist bomb attacks in Bombay last year.
Mr Sharif's admission was promptly denied by the Pakistani foreign ministry
which said, as it has before, that Pakistan has the technology to make atom
bombs but has decided not to manufacture such weapons. Nevertheless, the
former prime minister's claims will make it easier for Pakistan's
international critics to attack Islamabad over the nuclear issue, the
biggest point of tension between Pakistan and the west.
These developments could undermine prime minister Benazir Bhutto's efforts
to stabilise Pakistan after the domestic political storms which have
accompanied the country's transformation in the past five years from a
military dictatorship into a fragile democracy. Pakistan's political
stability is important not just for Pakistanis and their immediate
neighbours - an unstable Pakistan, vulnerable to the influence of Islamic
fundamentalists and armed with the means to make atom bombs, would be a
danger to all.
To avoid instability, Ms Bhutto, who took over as prime minister from Mr
Sharif after a general election victory last autumn, must bring economic and
social progress to one of the world's poorest nations. But she will find it
difficult to do this, if her attention is distracted by rows over nuclear
arms. Indeed, Mr Sharif, whose government collapsed last year amid arguments
with the powerful army and with the then-president, Mr Ghulam Ishaq Khan,
and who now leads the parliamentary opposition, seems to have been trying to
embarrass Ms Bhutto. As the Pakistani foreign ministry said, Mr Sharif's
words were 'a political statement made by a politician'.
Ms Bhutto herself acknowledges the damaging impact of the nuclear issue on
Pakistan's ties with the US and other western countries. 'We believe that it
is not right that the relations between Pakistan and the US be only
one-dimensional - that is only on the nuclear issue,' she told the FT in a
recent interview.
In any event, Ms Bhutto has recently been making some progress towards
bringing stability to Pakistan. Her first government, in 1988-89, lasted
only 20 months before it was toppled by the politically-powerful army and
its ally, Mr Ishaq Khan, the then-president. Her second administration has
had a much better start. Ms Bhutto herself, now 41, has established her
personal authority: she has got to grips with the tough world of Pakistani
politics. The army, under an avowedly non-political chief of staff, has
conspicuously stayed out of politics. Also, Ms Bhutto has been able to
manoeuvre Mr Farooq Leghari, a close aide, into the presidency, replacing Mr
Ishaq Khan.
Ms Bhutto had the additional good fortune not to succeed Mr Sharif directly.
Between Mr Sharif's resignation and her election, Pakistan was ruled by a
caretaker, Mr Moeen Qureshi, a former World Bank economist. Mr Qureshi cut
public spending and launched pro-market economic reforms in exchange for
emergency loans from the International Monetary Fund. Ms Bhutto came to
office only after the balance of payments crisis that precipitated Mr
Qureshi's call to the IMF was over.
Despite some back-sliding, Ms Bhutto has mainly stuck to Mr Qureshi's
programme. She has reduced the fiscal deficit, imports and bank lending  -
all of which soared under Mr Sharif. While inflation remains high, running
recently at 11 per cent a year, both the IMF and the World Bank have praised
the government's performance.
Admittedly, so far, economic growth has been weak, held back by poor crops
of cotton, the country's principal export. But, after recent modest
increases in gross domestic product - the economy expanded by an estimated 4
per cent for the year ending June 1994 - Ms Bhutto's officials believe that,
given good harvests, Pakistan can expect 7 per cent GDP growth in 1994-95.
The government is also making progress with economic restructuring. Measures
taken include cuts in import tariffs, deregulation, privatisation (notably
preparing to sell shares in PTC, the state-owned telecommunications
monopoly) and making the rupee fully convertible on the current account in
the 1994-95 budget.
Industry is responding. In June, ICI Pakistan, the 61-per-cent-owned
affiliate of ICI, the British chemicals group, announced plans for a Dollars
350m synthetic fibre materials plant - one of Pakistan's largest-ever
industrial investments. International bankers are close to approving the
Dollars 2bn 292 megawatt oil-fired power station project on the river Hub, a
joint public and private-sector scheme. Meanwhile, stocks on the Karachi
Stock Exchange have soared 70 per cent since Ms Bhutto came to office,
largely on the back of the international popularity of emerging markets
earlier this year.
Yet further economic advances will depend on Pakistan building on its
relative political stability.
Ms Bhutto boldly insists that she is as secure as any democratically-elected
leader. 'We don't have a democracy in name (any more); we have a democracy
in fact,' she says. But, given the country's record for political turmoil,
such a claim seems premature.
First, the army still looms large in public life, with fully one-third of
the budget spent on defence. While General Abdul Waheed, the chief of staff
who took over in early 1993, has kept out of politics, his successors may
not.
Moreover, if Pakistan is to be a true democracy, its National Assembly
(parliament) needs to be more representative. More than 50 per cent of the
assembly is drawn from the rural landowning class, which constitutes less
than 5 per cent of the population. Most Pakistanis still have little
political voice. They are poor, badly educated and vulnerable to
manipulation by Islamic fundamentalists.
Also, the landowning elite runs the country largely for its own benefit.
There is widespread undermining of public institutions through corruption,
nepotism, and violence.
Ms Bhutto hopes to spread the country's wealth beyond the elite through a
five-year Dollars 8bn Social Action Programme, supported by international
donors and designed to improve education and health services. Schooling in
Pakistan is particularly inadequate, with just 29 per cent of school-age
children enrolled in the late 1980s, compared with 68 per cent in India,
according to UN data. The problems lie in SAP's implementation - for
example, making sure teachers in backward districts do not abandon their
villages for the comfort of nearby towns.
These ambitious social plans could be fulfilled more easily if Pakistan
scrapped its nuclear programme. US economic aid, withheld from countries
suspected by Washington of having bomb-making technology, would immediately
resume. With it would probably come more foreign trade and investment.
But Islamabad is most unlikely to abandon its nuclear know-how. It has no
intention of even capping its nuclear programme at current levels unless
India also does so. India will not consider such a move unless China and
other big nuclear powers also call a halt to weapons development.
Mr Sharif's outburst does not change these realities. But by drawing the
world's attention to truths which Pakistan prefers to keep hidden he has
done his country no favours.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From M S WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It was disappointing to read Mr Peter Lilley's reported remarks
('Lilley takes shine off City bonuses', August 24) about 'companies and
their accountant advisers who devise ways of paying earnings which avoid
their liability for National Insurance contributions'. Mr Lilley would do
well to remind himself that it is Parliament, not the electorate, that makes
the law.
National Insurance legislation explicitly defines what is, and what is not,
'pay'. The choice confronting companies is (or was) simple: payment in cash
carried a 10.2 per cent surcharge, payment in kind did not. Which would the
social security secretary recommend employers choose, given the free choice
provided by law?
Perhaps Mr Lilley might more productively turn his attention to the wasteful
practice of running two parallel tax systems (one national insurance),
requiring two administrations, two collection agencies and two sets of
legislation.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Broadband network already available
to all
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAN BATES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The development of a national broadband infrastructure, as highlighted
by your editorial ('Phone rules', August 23) and by both John Harper
(Personal View, 'Riding tandem along UK superhighway', August 12) and
Jonathan Solomon (Letters, August 22), is one of the most important
strategic economic challenges facing the UK - and it is a challenge now
being met in full by the British cable industry.
The need to create a shared national infrastructure has been examined a
number of times over the past 10 years - including the debate prior to the
granting of the first cable licences in 1984, the discussions surrounding
the 1991 Duopoly Review and most recently by the Trade and Industry Select
Committee.
All of these discussions have concluded that the best way to bring the
benefits of improved service and cost-effective competition to the local
loop is by granting individual local broadband franchises which any company,
including BT or Mercury, can own and operate. This is bringing real choice
and enhanced service to residential and business users and leading to the
development of the world's most advanced, fibre-rich networks, giving
Britain a real competitive advantage.
A change to the regulatory framework will threaten the Pounds 10bn privately
financed investment being made by cable operators, which is delivering the
broadband revolution to UK consumers. If BT, or other national telephone
companies, want to benefit from this revolution, the rules are clear. BT is
not banned from the delivery of broadband or broadcast services, but to
provide them it must use the existing licensing process and franchise
system, on the same basis as other operators.
We must remember that the 'superhighway' is not one wire stretching from
John O'Groats to Land's End, but rather a network of networks. The cable
companies are building their infrastructure parallel to existing BT
facilities; operators interconnect with BT and Mercury for trunk connections
and between themselves on a regional basis, and we will no doubt reach
agreements with other new network operators such as Energis.
In Europe, single network, state-owned telecom companies are not delivering
broadband services to their customers - they have no real incentive to do
so.
In the UK the diversity of telecommunications service to the end user is
creating the competitive environment needed for truly successful
infrastructure development. It is this that will lead to the development of
applications and services needed to ensure that the full potential of these
new networks is realised.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Personal View: The waning power of Westminster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUE CAMERON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Michael Portillo,' sighed one of that gentleman's right-wing admirers, 'is
showing all the subtlety of a Spanish tuna fisherman.'
The disgruntled Tory was referring to the unfolding saga of Mr Portillo,
Britain's disabled workers and the European directive on public procurement
that nobody bothered to check. He feared the overtones of incompetent
government would damage the Conservative party. He could be right.
But the episode has wider significance. It provides a cameo example of why
the public is disillusioned with politicians of all parties and of how the
balance of power in Britain is shifting.
Above all, it underlines the decline in the authority of the House of
Commons. Almost without anyone noticing, Westminster's power and prestige
has been flowing away - to ministers, to judges, the press, to quangos, to
the financial community and to Europe.
The Portillo affair underlines the fact, as the employment secretary
intended it should, that more and more laws are made in Brussels, not
Westminster. But it also demonstrates the weakness of the British parliament
and the growing power of ministers. The House of Commons had no input into
the two-year drafting of the European directive. It was negotiated and
agreed by ministers and civil servants.
The power and prestige of the Commons has been so undermined that now senior
parliamentarians such as John Biffen, former leader of the House, believe
only drastic action will save it. 'Parliament is getting increasingly out of
touch,' he says.
The public is expressing its disillusion through opinion polls - politicians
are rated as less trustworthy than just about any other group, including
journalists and estate agents. Small wonder there is disquiet - it is not
just European directives that are flawed, domestic laws are often just as
ill-considered.
Nor is the Commons' method of doing business calculated to command respect.
As Sir Edward Heath, father of the house, says: 'It's what the public has
seen of the behaviour of the House of Commons and the way it conducts itself
 -through television - that has brought about a lot of the disillusion.'
There is also public disquiet at the way Westminster is failing in what
Gladstone said was its great duty: to hold to account those who run the
country. The long years of Conservative rule, often with huge majorities in
the Commons, have strengthened the government machine. The growth in the
number of young, ambitious MPs planning a lifetime career in politics has
made the alternate blandishments and bullying of the party whips more
effective.
And the cultural revolution in Whitehall appears to be fostering a more
compliant civil service.
The job of making ministers answerable is now being taken over by others
besides the Commons. It was the courts and the press that forced a reluctant
government to set up an inquiry into the arms-related exports to Iraq. And
the entire brouhaha over Mr Portillo's European directive would never have
impinged on public consciousness were it not for the press.
Mr Portillo's insistence that European law must be rigidly obeyed no matter
how flawed showed a healthy respect for the judges. In recent years the
senior judges, sensing the constitutional gap created by an increasingly
powerful executive and an ever more supine parliament, have started
developing judicial review as a way of constraining the excesses of central
government and other public bodies.
Westminster is losing power to other groups: to quangos over which it has
comparatively little control, the financial community - it is pointless for
MPs to tramp through the voting lobbies to deliver a verdict on the 400-page
Finance Bill when ministers admit they cannot control the money markets -
and to Europe.
Almost every day the headlines bring further proof of Europe's power to set
aside British Acts of Parliament - whether it is ex-army women suing for
unfair dismissal or fishermen wanting to overturn UK limits on the number of
days they can spend at sea. European law has taken precedence in areas
governed by the Treaty of Rome ever since Britain joined the Community in
1973. But only now is the reality starting to hit home.
And what is the input of the British parliament - as opposed to its
ministers - to European law? As Mr Portillo and the European directive
showed, it is virtually non-existent. Westminster MPs are powerless to
change European legislation.
The remedy for this abdication of democratic responsibility lies in
parliament's own hands. There are some small grounds for optimism. The
Liberal Democrats and the Labour party have reform on their agendas. There
are also signs that opposition and government will agree on the modest
changes recommended by the all-party Jopling committee.
But it is time for a whole raft of more far-reaching proposals. A new system
of scrutinising legislation - including proposed new European laws - when
still in the drafting stage is a possibility. Proper support staff for
select committees so they can better monitor government departments and
quangoes is another. And there must be greater transparency in all areas -
notably in government and Commons appointments.
Yet there is another dimension to the way power has passed from Westminster.
When economies and industries are run on a supra-national level, why should
law-making be limited to individual countries?

FT  26 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Charterers have only themselves to
blame
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr K D SHILLETO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to Charles Batchelor's article, 'Oil companies using older
tankers' (August 23).
Charterers of crude oil and product tankers have only themselves to blame if
charter rates go through the roof over the next two to three years. Blind
concentration on the 'bottom line' when negotiating with a surplus tanker
constituency has driven shipowners to cut operating and safety standards to
the minimum and postpone plans to build a replacement fleet.
A widening gap separates the number of very large crude carriers reaching
their 20th birthday by 1997 and new VLCC building contracts. Strong demand
for large dry bulk carriers is filling up the berths that could be producing
tankers, further delaying the date when new oil tonnage will be available.
Companies like Exxon should be chartering for period new and modern tankers
today not 'over the next two years'. Only this encouragement can fill the
gap in availability that will otherwise drive freight rates upwards by
several factors. Not that oil companies will lose. They will recoup all and
more at the petrol pumps.
That there has been no catastrophic oil spill since the Exxon Valdez is more
a matter of chance than industry concern about the risks.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Conveniently ignoring the facts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir PETER LEVENE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I cannot let Mr Reamsbottom's unfounded assertions which were made in
the letters column (August 23) go unchallenged.
On the subject of consultancy and market testing, Mr Reamsbottom is ignoring
the facts which do not fit his preconceptions.
Far from the government not providing detailed evidence to back up the
claims about market testing savings, this information is publicly documented
and is available in the Citizen's Charter Second Report and in the detailed
information provided to the Treasury and Civil Service Committee.
I deduce that the figure of Pounds 39m which Mr Reamsbottom claims has been
'run up' on consultancy costs for market testing has in fact been compiled
from adding together the amounts which were contained in three parliamentary
answers - covering different periods, answering differently framed questions
and risking triple counting]
He should also know better than to claim that the Efficiency Unit prevents
in-house civil service teams from competing in market tests - the bidders
for each competition are decided on a case by case basis within individual
departments.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Let market forces dictate on milk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BOBBY LAWES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Blaming the CAP for the current traumas of the UK dairy industry overlooks
the fact that all other EU countries have dynamic and relatively stable
dairy industries without Milk Marketing Boards. Also, the whole of Europe
has excess capacity following milk quotas.
Your leader 'Milk shakes' (August 24) welcomes deregulation of the market,
as we do, but the question is how to transit from A to B. The problem has
been caused by the Milk Marketing Board inventing the new scheme -
self-preservation rules. The alternative would be to 'jump start' direct
trade between producers and processors, and then allow the market forces to
determine prices, as in the rest of Europe.
A scheme along these lines has been put to government in Northern Ireland
but, so far, it appears to have fallen on deaf ears.

It is usually at 9.00 or 9.30 that programme clashes occur and you have to
resort to the VCR, but today it happens at 8.00. BBC2 shows My Name Is
Albert Watson, a profile of one of the world's top - though little known -
photographers. Born in Scotland and living in the US, Watson has 70 Vogue
covers to his credit and some of the best known photographs of rock stars
including the Rolling Stones. At the same time Channel 4 screens the last in
the current series of dance programmes, Tights, Camera, Action] Lea Anderson
introduces her own choreography in La Spectre da la Rose. Also at 8.00 on
BBC1 Jonathan Ross Presents David Copperfield. This will serve as a handy
puff for the American conjuror who is bringing his show to London this
autumn. And we should not forget The Bill, one of television's most
consistent drama series though not, as some seem to imagine, a 'soap' (8.00
ITV). Tarantula omelettes are never going to catch on, but the Survival
Special which gives news of the dish may well get a big rating, spiders
being one of those creatures, it seems, that viewers love to hate (9.00
ITV).

FT  26 AUG 94 / Arts: Synge's 'Well of the Saints' - Edinburgh Festival /
Alastair Macaulay is reminded of other Irish playwrights, Friel and Beckett
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Blind person recovers sight, cannot cope with the world, prefers to return
to sightlessness. How strange to see, within 15 days, two plays, each by an
important playwright, tackling this particular theme: one a world premiere
(Molly Sweeney) by Brian Friel, the other a rarely performed play from 1905,
The Well of the Saints, by JM Synge. And both playwrights intensely Irish.
These plays share a paradise-lost view of the world - a view that to taste
of the tree of knowledge is to shatter all contentment - and they suggest
that that view is profoundly Irish.
The Well of the Saints actually deals with a blind couple, a middle-aged man
and wife both miraculously cured by holy water. Unlike Molly Sweeney, this
is what most people would call a real play: ie the characters talk to each
other, there is a specific locale, and things happen in the present tense.
And it is morally complex.
These two blind people, Martin and Mary Doul, were never saints and acquire
no jot of saintliness. Full of complaints in the first place, and deeply
distrustful of those who have sight, they had both been convinced that each
other was a physical beauty, and, on recovery of sight, they both become
obsessed by the importance of good looks. The notion that ignorance was
bliss is a condition they only gradually and painfully attain. Nor does
experience teach them compassion. They are, at the end, much the same
grumbling duo as they had been at the start.
The bare and ruined place where the action (or inaction) occurs, and the
bleak spiritual outlook of the play, also prefigure the work of another
Irish playwright - Beckett. But The Well of the Saints is, above all,
recognisably by the author of The Playboy of the Western World. It has the
same richly poetic use of Irish speech patterns, the same irony and
tragi-comic quality, and the same romantic sense of how ordinary poor people
are torn between sensual passion and respect for social order.
'Put down your can now, and come along with myself, for I'm seeing you this
day, seeing you, maybe, the way no man has seen you in the world,' says the
seeing Martin Doul to another woman, Molly Byrne, in Act Two. 'Let you come
on now, I'm saying, to the lands of Iveragh and the Reeks of Cork, where you
won't set down the width of your two feet and not be crushing fine flowers.'
He is no beauty and no saint, and yet Molly, 'a fine-looking girl', is for a
while mesmerised by his words. There are better, lovelier, kinder folk who
have no such poetry in them. In such moments, the play has as strong a sense
of the miraculous as when it shows the power of holy water. And this
production, directed by Patrick Mason for Dublin's Abbey Theatre, underlines
them, with changes (lighting designed by Trevor Dawson) from ordinary
daylight to a peculiar light that half-silhouettes the characters.
Sometimes Mason shows less feeling for the Beckettian inaction of the play.
As played currently at Edinburgh's King's Theatre, parts of Act Two, in
particular, drag. And I doubt whether Martin's near-seduction of Molly would
have half its effect without the fancy lighting. The Abbey actors, led by
Derry Power as Martin and Pat Leavy as Mary, are all very fair, but the
words have an inner life that could be more ravishing and disturbing than
they always make them. 'I'm thinking it's a good right ourselves have to be
sitting blind, hearing a soft wind turning round the little leaves of the
spring and feeling the sun, and we not tormenting our souls with the sight
of the gray days, and the holy men, and the dirty feet is trampling the
world,' says Martin after losing his sight again: which makes an impact on
us but could/should be yet more insidious. These are, however, cavils merely
about the degree of the production's success.
Meanwhile 1994 is producing an unusually large number of stagings of Synge's
best-known play, The Playboy of the Western World. On the Edinburgh Fringe,
the Scottish company Communicado is currently giving a thoroughly Irish
production of it, directed by Gerry Mulgrew. At times the language is played
more for sensuous charm than for disturbing force; and only Cara Kelly, in
the central role of Pegeen, goes for a thoroughly three-dimensional
realisation of a role. But the Communicado house style, with its strikingly
imaginative ensemble effects of wordless physical theatre, makes some fine
contributions here and there. And in the relatively small space of the
Traverse's main auditorium, the play's potent poetry, abundant comedy, and
intimate scale all work remarkably well.
The Well of the Saints is at the King's Theatre, Edinburgh, until 28 August.
The Playboy of the Western World continues at the Traverse until September
3.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Arts: Wigglesworth's Shostakovich - Promenade concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tuesday's richly rewarding Prom of Mahler's Ruckert Lieder and
Shostakovich's Seventh Symphony reminded one of Mark Wigglesworth's position
as one of Britain's most gifted young conductors. On a purely technical
level, he drew disciplined, polished playing from the BBC National Orchestra
of Wales - and, in in terms of decibels, some of the stillest orchestral
pianissimos and most shattering fortissimos the Albert Hall has heard in a
long time - but his interpretations gave notice of a mature, musicianly
mind.
The 'Leningrad' Symphony is by no means a work that plays itself and
Wigglesworth, unencumbered by score, welded a coherent account of the
80-minute epic. The opening bristled with excitement, the great sonorous
octaves given out with unerring precision: the orchestra marched through the
first-movement ostinato, building it up inexorably to a point where it
indeed seemed like an advancing army, capable of obliterating anything.
But, as we now know, the symphony is about more than only - only] - the
German siege of Leningrad; and Wigglesworth sought, and found, the deep
seriousness of emotion and suffering in its middle movements. Listeners have
long felt that it deals with more than one kind of institutionalised
violence and further confirmation of this comes in Elizabeth Wilson's new
Shostakovich: A Life Remembered: the composer's friend Flora Litvinova
recalls him saying, 'this music is about all forms of terror, slavery, the
bondage of the spirit . . . not just about Fascism, but about our system, or
any form of totalitarianism'.
Wigglesworth had also been at one with the composer's intentions in the
Ruckert Lieder, proving himself a sensitive accompanist. Thomas Allen, on
best of form, was the consummate soloist, bringing the elegance and
restraint these songs require. The baritone caught the contrasts between
each one of the five - in particular, the stillness of 'Ich atmet' einen
linden Duft', the drama of 'Um Mitternacht'; and the resignation of 'lch bin
der Welt abhanden gekommen'. All were hauntingly memorable.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Arts: The Winslow Boy - Theatre in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The steady revival of Terence Rattigan's reputation as a playwright is in
danger of being halted in its tracks by this remarkably inept production of
The Winslow Boy at the Globe. Admirers of Rattigan, however, need not have
undue fears; the faults lie not in the play, but in the performances and the
direction.
The Winslow Boy was first performed in 1946 just after the end of the second
world war, but is set shortly before the outbreak of the first in 1914.
Surely the juxtaposition matters. The piece is about Englishness in a
changing world.
Some of the background is factual. George Archer-Shee was expelled from the
Royal Naval College at Osborne because he was thought to have stolen a five
shilling postal order from a fellow cadet. The appeals against the judgment
went to the House of Commons and the boy was exonerated. The play is loosely
based on that, but being Rattigan there is rather more to it.
We never know in the end whether the boy was guilty or not. The question is
whether it was worth bringing the case, which disrupts an entire family
because of the publicity it creates, and whether there is really so much to
be said for an English legal system which can devote so much time to one
small affair while the country is on the verge of war.
You can argue about that as much as you like; that is one one of the merits
of the play. Yet where the direction by Wyn Jones falls down is in painting
the Winslow family as a bunch of Edwardian fogies, young and old, from the
start. This is a travesty.
The Winslows may not be rich, but they are comfortably off, the father
having recently retired from a senior post at the Westminster Bank. He is
well read, sometimes witty and refers to Voltaire. The elder son, Dickie,
goes to Oxford, even though he ploughs his exams. The family is also
liberal. Daughter Catherine (well played on a bad night by Eve Matheson) is
a voluntary worker for the suffragettes, but has no problems about living at
home with her middle class background; nor has the family in accommodating
her.
The Kensington home must be quite decent, even smartish. A female journalist
asking about the case is attracted by the curtains - a new material from
Barkers. In the designs by Mark Bailey, the curtains cannot even be seen
from the middle of the stalls: the rest of the set is entirely drab.
What we should be watching is the tranquillity of Edwardian England
disturbed by a moral family dilemma and thoughts of war in the background.
The family should visibly age as the Winslow case drags on; in this
production, they are prematurely old to start with, and that includes the
boy himself.
Simon Williams is not nearly sharp or suave enough as the King's Counsel who
gets the boy off. But, as I say, much could be retrieved if Wyn Jones would
go and sit in the audience, note the slowness of the pace and the general
lack of style, then give the show a new lick.

finds the LA Philharmonic full of the spirit of enterprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Esa-Pekka Salonen, the boyish (36 going on 18) music director of the Los
Angeles Philharmonic which plays the Proms at London's Albert Hall next
week, says: 'It is pleasing to be part of the underground'. A symphony
orchestra in Los Angeles, the popular entertainment capital of the world, is
distinctly left field. 'When we are playing Bruckner we are the alternative
culture', maintains Salonen.
Salonen has been at Los Angeles two years now, and 'it is very enjoyable.
Musically it is exactly as I expected, although the non-musical part of
being music director takes up a lot of time and energy'. Los Angeles likes
stars (previous music directors include Mehta, Previn and Giulini) and
Salonen, a composed, even cool, Finn, accepts the burden. 'The conductor in
his person represents the values of classical music in this area'.
In a city where looks matter, he fits the bill to perfection. He is also
professional enough to command respect in a place which makes its money by
taking entertainment very seriously. The crucial time for the Philharmonic
is now, when subscriptions are renewed for the winter season of concerts.
With over 80 per cent of supporters signing on again, Salonen, and managing
director Ernest Fleischmann, can breathe more easily.
Running a major orchestra in Los Angeles is a tough business. The arts in
the US are dependent on rich patrons and although there are plenty of
wealthy people in LA, they tend to be the insecure producers and stars of
the movie and pop industries who are too preoccupied with their roller
coaster careers to feel charitable. A few Hollywood personalities back the
Philharmonic - Walter Matthau is a friend and Sharon Stone is expressing an
interest - but apart from taking a socially desirable box at the Hollywood
Bowl, where the Philharmonic undertakes an ever longer, financially
essential summer season, the orchestra survives in an apathetic environment.
Fleischmann looks hungrily at cities like Boston where old money has enabled
the orchestra to build up an endowment of Dollars 110m. Although the LA
Philharmonic has an annual turnover of almost Dollars 37m, large by
orchestral standards, it has amassed an endowment of only Dollars 24m.
Fleischmann is embarking on a fund raising drive to raise this to Dollars
75m, which would produce an extra Dollars 5m a year in revenue and go some
way towards meeting the current Dollars 7m deficit.
He is optimistic that the money will come. Apart from the impact of Salonen,
in 1997 the Philharmonic moves into a new home, the Walt Disney Hall. This
has been paid for with the largest cash donation in the history of the arts
in the US. Lillian Disney came up with the initial Dollars 50m in memory of
her husband Walt and the rest of his family rallied round to produce Dollars
95m towards the Dollars 130m cost of the building.
The smartest LA architect, Frank Gehry, has been commissioned to produce
something startling and his design, which wraps the building in swathes of
limestone like a ship in full sail, is expected to become as much a landmark
in the city as is the Opera House in Sydney.
Change is whirling around the classical music scene in LA. Salonen is
fanatical about contemporary music. 'A symphony orchestra should maintain
the tradition that exists, but it should also create new things.' So most of
the world's leading composers have been commissioned to provide works for
Walt Disney Hall.
Salonen has naturally brought a northern repertoire, more Sibelius and
Nielsen, to the orchestra, but he has also attempted to improve its variety
to give it 'a palate rich enough to accommodate a more flexible approach',
as he diplomatically puts it. The aim is to keep the warmth associated with
American bands but to make it tighter. The strings are also to be coached in
the 18th century repertoire by Roger Norrington.
Behind the scenes the Philharmonic is determined to get back into the black.
Staff has been thinned, some outreach programmes axed. It will pay for
performing in the new hall, which cuts its seating capacity from over 3200
to less than 2400, by playing each programme more frequently. Seat prices
will also rise.
Chairman of the board Stanley Beyer wants to play up the orchestra's
involvement with the Hollywood Bowl. For years this was where the
Philharmonic lets its hair down during soft summer nights. But now, with
audiences regularly topping 13,000, its short 11 week season in the Bowl
contributes almost Dollars 15m of the Dollars 21m the Philharmonic earns at
the box office each year.
Last week at the Bowl Salonen was previewing the music he is taking on the
European tour: Lutoslawski, Sibelius, Carter and all, tough stuff in fantasy
land. But the audience, much of it young and bussed in from the satellite
communities which make up LA, appreciated the fact that their new young
maestro was treating them as adults. Like Simon Rattle in Birmingham,
Salonen is toughening up the programme but taking a larger audience along on
the ride.
As he says, 'there is a certain spirit of enterprise in LA. People are ready
to experience new things. There is no preconceived idea of what is right or
wrong. Audiences are more able to accept the new. You can be unconventional
easier here than anywhere else. It is a city of disasters and
entertainment.' He will be hoping to emphasise the entertainment side at the
Proms next week.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Technology: World explorers on software trail - Software at
Work / A system that sets travellers and tour operators in the right
direction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
People usually have clear ideas about what they want from a holiday. Sun,
sea and sand are still on the list, but an increasing number of travellers
wish to set their own agenda. The standard package does not cater for them,
but straying from the beaten track is encouraged by Rainbow Holidays of
York.
Rainbow specialises in tailored itineraries for individuals who are making
the trip of a lifetime - a retirement trip, for example, or a family reunion
in a remote area of Australia.
Every item on the trip, down to the car transfer from the airport, appears
on Rainbow's TourCat computerised system.
Beside the items, vital information appears for the tour operator: the
profit margin and how it is divided between operator and travel agent. The
system is used to quote on complex trips with multiple components, and
enables the UK company to explore a variety of options.
If a client needs to keep costs down, Rainbow can look for substitutes: a
bus connection from the airport, a cheaper room or a cheaper hotel
altogether.
If the customer changes his or her mind, the system provides instant
re-quotes, including airline bookings via a central reservation system such
as British Airways' Galileo. This 'modelling' of the ideal trip results in a
printed itinerary for the client showing the breakdown into individual
components, sometimes running to several pages.
'The printed itinerary really makes the dream trip come alive,' says
chairman David Miller. 'When people see all those wonderful place names
appear in print, along with actual times of arrival and departure, and
details like the car pick-up, people's aspirations suddenly become real.
That's when they begin to get excited.'
The same computer system has helped Rainbow to target closely three
different markets and to track its success with individual products and
agents. An unexpected benefit has been its use in competitive situations:
Rainbow is able to shave margins in a head-on bid or offer instant
alternatives.
For instance, Rainbow has won business because its detailed itinerary made
clear that a rival company's lower price did not include all the items -
such as the ferry fare for a campervan between New Zealand's two islands.
The travel and leisure business has proved precarious during the recession.
But with the information available on the computer system, Rainbow's staff
is particularly attuned to profit margins and the group now has a turnover
exceeding Pounds 23m. Survival in the travel trade, Miller believes, depends
on responding to changes in the market with the right products. An
entrepreneur with interests in other business areas, he has built the
company up by reacting quickly to market trends. Miller founded Greenfield
Holdings (of which Rainbow is a part) as a hotel company in 1977 after 17
years in hotel management.
Rainbow was founded in 1981 to offer short breaks in the UK. As well as
filling empty beds in its own three Croft hotels in Dundee, Birmingham, and
Edinburgh, the company took other hotels on to its books and started a
booming business in weekend breaks. The UK Short Breaks brochure offers 400
hotels in more than 200 locations. Rainbow's long-haul business started in
1989 and quickly expanded from covering Australia and New Zealand to include
more unusual destinations.
In 1991, the short breaks formula was extended to Europe, and Rainbow
acquired the European Travel House to build up inbound European business.
This is high-volume, low-income trade, along the lines of package holidays.
The long-haul niche market has grown as other more conventional holidays
have struggled to maintain market share.
The tailor-made holidays, known as 'itinerary build' in the trade, now
account for 57 per cent of Rainbow's turnover. 'The long-haul business is
the most volatile in terms of margin because each component can affect gross
profit margins. But we also have to be market-driven and respond to the
competition,' says Miller.
The recession flattened turnover to the degree that Miller had to look
closely at Rainbow's costs. The company had become computerised with its
first reservation system in 1984, but the various departments had
incompatible systems that had limited new product development and cost large
amounts in maintenance.
The aim was to standardise with a single computer system able to deal with
all three areas of business, including specialised itineraries. It had to
provide good communications, instant links and booking capabilities with
airline CRSs, a range of specialised reports, and confirmations and
ticketing.
None of the standard travel systems met all Rainbow's criteria. Rainbow knew
the TravelCat software developed by C-Cat of Hull, and when C-Cat approached
with the idea of TourCat, Rainbow invested Pounds 1.5m in a joint
development.
'We needed the ability to react to the market and its changing products very
quickly, and we couldn't wait for the technology to catch up,' explains
Miller.
C-Cat now sells TourCat as a 'turn-key' package of hardware and software: a
system of 60 terminals such as Rainbow's costs around Pounds 150,000.
For Margaret Simpson, operations director in charge of the system, the main
challenge was to make everyone feel that the system could cope with their
specialisation. A lot of time was spent analysing industry needs and any
resistance to change was dealt with by showing staff TourCat's potential.
'One of the main problem areas in the old system was building the Sunday
evening discount into the hotel costs,' she says. 'Once people realised they
could throw away their calculators and paper, they couldn't wait.'
Sharon Hutchinson, reservations manager for short breaks, agrees: 'No more
mistakes on discounts, and it is excellent for checking availability and
offering alternatives.'
Long-haul reservations manager Simon Bean uses TourCat as a management
reporting tool as well as for quotations and availability searches. 'I use
it to compile statistics on the reservations clerks, so that I can see their
conversion rate, spot gaps in their product knowledge, and provide
appropriate training.'
Rainbow's inbound tour business depends on good marketing relationships with
customers such as Air Malta, and Cathay Pacific and Creative in Sydney.
These customers want direct online access, and they get it. The system links
to terminals in 7,200 retail travel agents.
Communications are an important part of the software package. 'The future is
all based around communications,' says Miller. 'The way a company our size
competes with First Choice (recently renamed Owners Abroad) or Thomson is by
being better in our niche, more focused on specific client bases. And the
information we are getting from the system is stunning.'
He cites a controlled experiment on two batches of 200 travel agents, where
one simple targeting tactic brought about a 51 per cent improvement in
conversion rates in one group. It also resulted in fewer brochures, and a
saving on the print bill of Pounds 128,000. 'We thought our gut feel was
terribly good until we began to get real information out of TourCat,' admits
Miller.
The TourCat system has earned its keep since its installation in June 1993.
'We printed 2.5m Short Break brochures for 1994. In the past we have not
been sure of the conversion rate for any specific agent, but TourCat can run
a report in four minutes that tells us about the grading of our various
agents. We buy 1,250 tonnes of paper annually, and with paper prices rising,
that is a significant saving.
'The system gives full leash to the creativity of the staff here, it makes
them more successful in what we call directional selling. It is the
confidence the agents have in us that matters and that is where the system
makes us better,' concludes Miller.

Surgeons at Salisbury District Hospital plan 12 operations to restore hand
movement to patients paralysed by spinal injury, writes Andrew Derrington.
Implanted electrodes will stimulate muscles that have been disconnected from
the brain. In some cases muscle tendons will be transplanted to give better
control. The stimulator will be controlled by shrugging the opposite
shoulder.
The operations at Salisbury are part of a larger test series, co-ordinated
from the US, says Jack Gardner of Inspire Foundation, which is paying for
the electronic equipment.

Identifying people by fingerprints has long appeared an attractive way of
combating fraud. Startek, a Taiwan-based company, has devised a fingerprint
identification system which it believes is reliable enough to be used as a
security device. It uses a small scanning device to take a 'picture' of a
fingerprint, which is compared with one previously registered in a computer
system, in a process lasting about three seconds. It says that fewer than 1
per cent of prints are falsely rejected, while fewer than one in 100,000
prints is falsely accepted.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scientists working for the Medical Research Council in Cambridge have
identified the structure of an enzyme that plays a leading role in the
conversion of energy within cells. The structure of the enzyme, known as
F-ATPase, is described in this week's Nature, the scientific journal.
The researchers, at the MRC's Laboratory of Molecular Biology, believe that
knowledge of the detailed structure of F-ATPase and the other enzyme
complexes involved in energy conversion will aid understanding of the ageing
process, together with neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases.
The enzyme, which is about 200,000 times smaller than a pinhead, is the
biggest high-resolution asymmetrical biological structure yet determined by
X-ray crystallography. The structure shows the positions of almost 3,000
amino acids on the enzyme.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Insecticide sprays often indiscriminately destroy both pests and useful
organisms. Researchers at the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Polymer
Research in Teltow, Germany, believe they have found a way to target pests
more effectively by enclosing the insecticide in a degradable microcapsule.
The capsules, which attach themselves to the leaves of crops, are eaten by
the pests. Less insecticide is needed than with current techniques, spraying
is less frequent and there is reduced risk that toxic agents are washed into
the soil by rain. The system also avoids use of toxic solvents, often added
to insecticides to improve spraying qualities.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Management: Hierarchies of the middle-up-down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the unending puzzles for westerners about the way Japanese companies
operate is the relationship between boss and subordinate. In an unusually
structured society, top managers command enormous authority and respect. Yet
at the same time Japanese companies tend to be remarkably participative, or
at least consultative; there are few countries in which front-line and
middle managers have as much influence on strategy.
Some western writers have claimed that this is a sham: that Japanese workers
and middle managers feed their bosses what the latter want to hear.
More sophisticated writers argue to the contrary: that the innovativeness
and creativity of Japanese companies, especially in knowledge-intensive
industries such as electronics, rests heavily on the injection of ideas from
those closest to the customer and to technological change - in other words,
from the bottom or middle. In a celebrated article a few years ago, a Tokyo
professor, Ikujiro Nonaka, christened this style 'middle-up-down
management'.
Now two western writers with a subtle grasp of both culture and
organisational systems have produced an explanation which builds on Nonaka's
analysis.
The authors are Charles Hampden-Turner, a British academic at Cambridge best
known for his pioneering work on how to thrive on ambiguity and dilemma, and
Fons Trompenaars, a Franco-Dutch expert on national differences in business.
In The Seven Cultures of Capitalism*, a wide-ranging and provocative book
published this year - which has had an undeservedly quiet reception, partly
because of its philosophical overtones - Hampden-Turner and Trompenaars
concede the obvious: that the Japanese are far more deferential to authority
than Americans; that they use a language indicative of the relative social
standings of speakers and those spoken to; and that they are most reluctant
to criticise openly anyone but close colleagues.
What is less obvious is that Japanese hierarchies are very different from
typical Anglo-Saxon chains of command, in which the boss sits many miles
from the customer and the technical action. In Japan, they tend instead to
constitute what Hampden-Turner and Trompenaars call, awkwardly, a series of
'inclusive co-ordinations'. These, they suggest, resemble inverted Chinese
puzzle boxes, one inside the other (see diagram).
Whereas the levels of a US hierarchy have considerable gaps and
psychological distance between them, in Japan each higher level encompasses
the one beneath it, the duo argues. The superior not only has his feet more
on the ground, and is in closer direct contact with lower levels, but is
usually also more of a co-ordinator than a leader. Hence the term 'inclusive
co-ordination'.
As Seven Cultures argues, most top men in Japan tend to lay down abstract
values and policies, and then synthesise the innovative actions and other
initiatives which flow up from those beneath him. Like the 'coaching' style
much-advocated in the west, but little practised there as yet, the Japanese
leader spends much of his time listening, responding, nurturing, and
formulating after-the-event policy from strategies that have emerged from
below.
This combination of top-down management with bottom-up participation
contrasts with American management theory, which has tended to pit the two
against each other.
Japanese hierarchy also differs from western autocracy in its tradition of
benevolent leadership and minimalist control, according to Seven Cultures.
Strong emotional obligations are placed on Japanese leaders by their
subordinates. Moreover, unlike westerners influenced by the sociologist Max
Weber, the Japanese make no distinction between Gemeinschaft, a close-knit
group with voluntary affections, and Gesellschaft, a contractual association
for work.
As the book demonstrates, Japan's strong collectivism supports the ability
of its companies to create harmony between seemingly conflicting factors.
Authority is combined with empowerment, hierarchy with participation, and so
on.
The net result is unparalleled proficiency at the sort of complex
organisational learning, corporate renewal, and competitive flexibility
which every western company is struggling to emulate.
What Hampden-Turner and Trompenaars do not explore sufficiently is the
downside of the group commitment which underpins 'middle-up-down'
decision-making in Japan: an atmosphere that most westerners find
oppressive. So do some Japanese these days. But when old thinking habits are
so powerful and deep-rooted, they die hard.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Management: 'Modelnetics' of life - An unorthodox style of
promoting participation and flexibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Claude Bebear, chairman of France's Axa insurance group, enjoyed an unusual
evening this summer in the company of a team of Chinese jugglers and a
chorus of opera singers. Together with 170 managers from 10 of Axa's
international operations, Bebear then spent the night on China's Great Wall.
Amid the charred remains of a roasted lamb and crates of empty bottles of
wine from the group's French vineyards, the managers slept in sleeping bags
and rose at 4.30 to watch the sun rise.
Their bonding experience, part of a seven-day trip to China, reflects
Bebear's unorthodox approach to managing the group, which over the last five
years has become one of Europe's biggest and most rapidly growing insurance
companies. Indeed, since taking a 49 per cent stake in Equitable Life of the
US in 1991 Axa has signalled its ambition to play on an even bigger stage.
These aspirations were underlined last week when Axa acquired Boreal
Assurances, the Canadian insurer, in an acquisition which will make the
company the fourth largest insurer in Canada. Axa also recently secured
provisional authority to set up a life insurance business in Japan and
announced plans to invest Dollars 200m (Pounds 133m) in the venture over the
next five to seven years.
The China escapade is one of the most striking examples of Axa's - and
Bebear's - iconoclastic and radical style, in an industry where management
has traditionally been slow moving, status conscious and parochial.
Vestiges of that conservatism are still visible in some corners of Bebear's
empire. At Axa Equity &amp; Law, for example, the High Wycombe-based UK life
insurance company taken over by Axa in 1987, managers - curiously known as
'officials' - are still rewarded for each upward move in the company
hierarchy with tiny improvements in their work surroundings. Desk sizes,
floor coverings and even the equipping of offices with hat stands are tied
rigorously to seniority.
But commercial pressures have already begun to force a change in attitudes.
Four hundred jobs have disappeared since 1990 - many of them middle managers
squeezed out as the company sought to flatten the management hierarchy.
There were 'an awful lot of titles which didn't carry any responsibility',
comments David Thorley, marketing director.
Bebear's approach is designed to reinforce these sorts of changes across the
organisation, preparing senior mangers for a much more competitive
environment and making them more flexible and responsive to change. In
particular, the company is concerned to build on its international strengths
by obtaining maximum benefit from the range of management and specialist
expertise at its disposal.
Before the China visit, for example, six teams - each drawing their
resources from separate parts of the Axa empire - worked in their free time
on competing proposals about how Axa could penetrate the Chinese market.
Wherever necessary they made use of the company's communications facilities,
such as video conferencing. During the China visit, each group presented its
conclusions to the committee responsible for corporate strategy.
Axa has taken other opportunities to bring its senior executives together.
Since 1987, for example, Bebear has masterminded three other adventure
workouts in unusual locations.
Managers spent a week in tents in the Sahara desert in 1987; Bebear hired a
train to take them around Europe in 1990; and two years ago, top staff were
flown to the Caribbean island of St Martin.
Attempts to improve communications are not confined to the top. The company
is also keen to promote greater direct contact between managers at lower
levels, especially in specialised areas such as telecommunications,
information technology and fund management. Rather than communicating
through managers, Thorley says 'it is far better for the guy installing
telephone systems in France or the UK to talk directly to his counterpart in
the US'.
One method of improving communications favoured by Axa is 'modelnetics', a
management training system developed by Main Even Management Corporation, a
California-based group. The system uses 151 'models' - buzzwords and symbols
 -to promote use of management concepts that promote participation and
flexibility. Axa has been using it for the last few years.
Its managers in High Wycombe are quick to use modelnetics jargon. 'Slot
machine management' - frequent moves of personnel and resources within an
organisation - and 'management smog' - the lack of communication associated
with dense bureaucracies - are deplored. Employees are encouraged to think
laterally or outside 'the logic box'. Thorley sees it as 'a common language
that helps us understand common problems'.
Currently, Axa is placing more stress on the development of its own central
training programme at its 'university', a training centre attached to the
group's Bordeaux vineyards.
Richard Nicol, human resources director who joined Axa earlier this year
after long spells with Total and Airbus Industrie, plans to unveil an
ambitious new training scheme for all his company's managers later this
year.
The scheme - which involves a rolling programme of one-week courses - will
subject each of Axa's 5,500 managers to peer group and subordinate
assessment for the two months prior to the course. Nicol says the emphasis
is on participative management.
Summarising his experience with Axa, which he joined after working for a
range of top UK businesses, Thorley says: 'Most companies I've worked for
define the frame and everything inside the frame. They tell you everything
you can do and can't do,' he says. By contrast Axa 'provides the framework,
and how you go about it is very much up to you. Bebear has sent a clear
signal that he doesn't want little clones everywhere.'

FT  26 AUG 94 / Pupil-teacher ratios worsen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
School class sizes in England and Wales rose last year. In all
state-maintained schools there was an average of 18.1 pupils for each
teacher at the beginning of this year, compared with 17.8 in January 1993.
The reduction in teacher numbers has been concentrated on primary schools,
where the average class size was 22.7, up from 22.1 in 1984.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Labour's opinion poll lead grows
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A MORI poll for The Times newspaper today puts Labour's support on 56 per
cent (compared with 51 per cent at the end of July), with the Tories
unchanged on 23 per cent and Liberal Democrats down 3 percentage points at
18 per cent.
The poll shows that support for Labour among the middle classes, women and
southern voters has grown since Mr Tony Blair's election as party leader
five weeks ago.
Half the public is undecided about Mr Blair's performance as Labour leader,
although he enjoys a favourable rating among the rest.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Railtrack accused on retired workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The RMT transport union last night accused Railtrack of employing a 'Dad's
Army' of retired signalling staff in its efforts to break the 11-week-old
rail strike, Charles Batchelor writes.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said Railtrack planned to employ a
retired inspector at Birmingham New Street next Tuesday and had approached
other retired staff in a move which posed a threat to the safety of the
railway network.
Railtrack confirmed that it had signed up one recently retired signalling
manager who had taken early retirement in his mid-50s. It was looking to
re-employ retired staff in their fifties and not people over 65.
Railtrack said: 'These are very senior people with very valuable experience
who would be very offended to be described as a Dad's Army.'

FT  26 AUG 94 / Slow but sure pension sea-change: Long-term movement in
policies' popularity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At first sight the new business figures released by the Association of
British Insurers yesterday are like gently rolling English countryside,
generally flat but with some slight valleys.
On closer inspection, however, they reveal longer-term changes which have a
more significant influence on the personal pensions and life insurance
landscape.
There are three trends which are highlighted by the figures for the second
quarter of this year - the shift from regular to single premium policies, a
move away from products which are not linked to equity investments, and a
marked decline in sales through home collections.
The reluctance of customers to take on long-term commitments is behind the
trend towards single-premium policies. The number of yearly premium life
insurance policies has been falling since 1991, when 5.29m were taken out.
About 4.64m were taken out last year.
The total is fewer than 2m for the first half of this year.
Numbers of regular premium personal pensions have similarly fallen, from
1.56m in 1991 to 1.28m last year. Only about 563,000 have been sold in the
first six months of this year.
By contrast, sales of single premium life insurance policies have held up
rather better. Although the 276,000 policies and Pounds 2.4bn new premiums
for the second quarter are below the comparable figures for the second
quarter last year, they are higher than the equivalent figures in 1991.
This changing balance between regular and single premium policies has been
apparent from the new business figures reported from large life insurers
such as Legal &amp; General.
Further below the surface has been the shift towards 'linked' policies in
the types of investment that are preferred by customers, which is revealed
by the ABI statistics.
Linked policies - which can be life insurance products or pensions - are
policies where part of the premiums buy investment units, for example in an
equity or property portfolio, which are managed by a fund manager. Their
value can fluctuate but there is the prospect of higher returns to make up
for the risk that the value when the policy reaches maturity will be lower
than the payout from a conventional policy.
Non-linked policies are generally invested in gilts or deposits, where both
the risk and potential returns are lower, but the value of the policy is
raised by bonuses from the profits of the fund during the course of its
life, culminating in a terminal bonus.
The ABI figures show that the steepest falls in business in a comparison
between the second quarter of this year and last year have been in
non-linked policies.
New premiums from linked annual and single-premium individual pensions and
from linked single-premium life insurance were broadly similar in the period
from April to the end of June in 1993 and 1994, but premiums in non-linked
products in the same categories fell by up to 35 per cent from their 1993
levels.
The figures also confirm a clear shift in how life insurance is sold.
Policies sold through the 'industrial branch' - where a sales agent calls
once every two weeks or so at the home of a customer to collect what are
often relatively small premiums - have plummeted.
At 201,000 policies and Pounds 28m new premium income for the second
quarter, both sets of numbers are now less than half the equivalent just two
years ago.
Concerns among life companies such as Prudential about the cost of
collecting premiums from customers' homes mean that industrial branch
business is likely to continue to diminish.
Customers' fears about job prospects are likely to mean that the shift away
from regular premium products is likely to continue so long as memories of
the most recent recession remain fresh.
Life companies must hope that the trend to linked policies, which the ABI
says shows a confidence in the life companies' investment performance, is
similarly persistent to offset the other changes.

FT  26 AUG 94 / West Coast rail plan to cost Pounds 500m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Modernisation plans for the 550-mile West Coast main railway are unlikely to
lead to construction of a high-speed line on the French model because of the
cost and the likelihood of environmental protests.
But Mr Gil Howarth, Railtrack's director of major projects, said yesterday
that the introduction of '21st-century signalling' with modest changes to
the present route should still lead to significant reductions in journey
times.
The Pounds 500m upgrading of the West Coast route, last modernised in the
1970s, is expected to reduce the London to Glasgow journey from six to four
hours, London to Manchester or Liverpool from 2 3/4 to two hours, and London
to Birmingham from two to 1 1/4 hours. These times should prove competitive
with airline schedules.
The West Coast line is one of the busiest in the UK, carrying more than
2,000 trains a day. InterCity expresses account for 16 per cent of train
journeys although they cover 80 per cent of the mileage travelled.
The likely design of the line has emerged from a 'second sift' of options
carried out by a 60-strong project team consisting of staff of Railtrack and
WCML Development, a private-sector consortium involved in the feasibility
study. A third review will take place in October in time for final proposals
to be put to the government before Christmas.
A construction consortium will be selected by competitive tender to start
work next year. Depending on the degree of disruption acceptable to existing
services, modernisation will take between four and eight years.
Local authorities and business interests along the line have been pressing
for it to be upgraded to speeds of 125mph to 185mph. It appears top speeds
will be at the lower end of this range, but improved journey times can still
be gained by track realignment and modifications to narrow tunnels.
Significant improvements will result from the upgrading of signalling. The
latest airline-style radio-operated system, which does away with track-side
signals, could be used on the fastest sections of track. A more conventional
system would operate around big cities.
Mr Howarth said it would be possible for InterCity services to be controlled
over the entire route by a single signalling centre but two or three centres
were more likely. This is likely to lead to a reduction in the number of
signalling staff.
A decision has yet to be taken on whether new rolling stock will be provided
for the line - at a further likely cost of Pounds 300m to Pounds 400m -
although the more modern the track and signalling systems, the more likely
it becomes that new trains will be needed. One option being considered is
tilting trains similar to those in Sweden and Spain.
The private sector is expected to contribute most of the cost of the project
 -in return for a concession to operate the line - although public funds
will also be needed. Present government thinking is for the line to be
financed through a subsidy for the train operators' track-access charges
rather than by a grant to meet capital costs.
The consortium which wins the contract will probably be expected to take
responsibility for maintaining the track.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Pollard quits at Sunday Express
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The husband and wife editing team of Sir Nicholas Lloyd at the Daily Express
and his wife at the Sunday Express was split yesterday with the abrupt
resignation of Lady Lloyd, Ms Eve Pollard.
Ms Pollard, the former editor of the Sunday Mirror who was appointed editor
of the Sunday Express in May 1991, is 'to go in search of other interests'.
In an agreed statement Ms Pollard agreed to remain a consultant to Express
Newspapers.
Mr Brian Hitchen, a former deputy editor of the Sunday Express and present
editor of the Daily Star, takes over as editor of the Sunday Express on
September 1.
Mr Hitchen, who has for many years wanted to edit the Sunday Express, takes
on one of the most difficult jobs in national newspapers - trying to reverse
the apparently remorseless long-term decline in the paper's circulation.
During Ms Pollard's editorship the Sunday Express became a tabloid and there
have been periods of rising circulation. Trying to displace the the
influence of the Mail on Sunday has proved more difficult.
The vacancy at the Daily Star prompted speculation that Mr Kelvin MacKenzie
might fill the chair. The former editor of The Sun recently resigned
abruptly from the managing director's job at BSkyB, the satellite television
broadcaster, after losing a power struggle with Mr Sam Chisholm, chief
executive.
However, it is thought unlikely at United Newspapers, owner of the Daily
Star, that Mr MacKenzie will move to the newspaper. An internal appointment
is thought more plausible.
In a statement yesterday Ms Pollard said she had enjoyed her years as editor
of the Sunday Express.
'It has been an exciting and innovative period but now the newspaper is in
prosperous health I think the time is right for me to seek new challenges,'
said Ms Pollard.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Sunderland AFC views second site
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sunderland Association Football Club is considering a disused colliery site
for its new sports and conference complex, as an alternative to development
of green belt land next to Nissan's Pounds 900m Wearside car plant.
The plan for a Pounds 75m complex, which has prompted angry exchanges
between the club and the carmaker, was to have gone to a public inquiry.
But yesterday Mr John Wood, a director of the club, confirmed that it was
investigating the possibility of a smaller development on the Wearmouth
colliery site. This is less than a mile from the club's Victorian Roker Park
ground, from which it needs to move to fulfil the requirements of the Taylor
report on football ground safety.
Mining at Wearmouth, where shafts were sunk between 1826 and 1834, ended
last November and hopes of a buyer were dashed earlier this year.
The club, which has asked the Department of the Environment to postpone the
public inquiry plans, has not ruled out the land beside Nissan. But Mr Wood
said the club believed that it had to examine all possible alternatives.
The former colliery site covers 44 acres compared with the 184 acres of the
site beside Nissan. Mr Wood said plans for a leisure element, including a
multiplex cinema, bowling alley and hotel, would need to be dropped if
Wearmouth were chosen. There would still be a football stadium, covered
arena and conference centre. He could not give a revised price for the
scheme.
The Tyne and Wear Development Corporation, the planning authority for the
site, and Sunderland City Council have held informal discussions with the
club. The corporation plans extensive site investigations before deciding on
the land's future use. British Coal, the site's owner, said it had not yet
been approached by the club.
Nissan, which feared that the club's plan would disrupt its deliveries and
block its expansion prospects, welcomed the news. It said: 'We've always
believed there must be an alternative solution, maybe Wearmouth is the
answer.'

FT  26 AUG 94 / A Tory Icarus falls to earth: The chequered career of an
error-prone politician
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The eternally optimistic Lord Archer may not believe it, but his admission
that purchasing Anglia Television shares was a 'grave error' almost
certainly marks the end of his political career.
Lord Archer was 12,000 miles away from the controversy yesterday, signing
copies of his latest volume of short stories on a long-planned promotional
tour of Australia.
But Tory MPs said there was no doubt that Lord Archer's statement delivered
the quietus to his long-running campaign for ministerial or Conservative
party office.
A senior backbencher said: 'All this is a great shame, because he really has
a lot of talent. The party certainly needs talent, but even Jeffrey can't
come back from this.'
It has been a roller-coaster ride. Elected to the Commons before he was 30,
Lord Archer fell into severe financial difficulties after an unwise
investment and was out of the House within five years.
His first novel, Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less, restored his solvency
within three years. A string of best-sellers made him a multi-millionaire
within a decade.
For a while Lord Archer's star was firmly in the ascendant as he used his
wealth and undoubted campaigning ability to help the Conservative party.
Baroness Thatcher made him deputy chairman of the party in 1985, with a
brief to go out and enthuse the grassroots activists.
A year later he resigned after a tabloid newspaper claimed that a gift of
Pounds 2,000 to a prostitute was intended to stop her revealing that he had
slept with her.
Lord Archer won Pounds 500,000 damages against the newspaper in a
spectacular 1987 libel case that cleared his name. But political
rehabilitation has been more difficult to achieve.
Many senior Conservatives, including some who have shared his hospitality,
made clear in the wake of the case that his ebullient approach to life was
not to their taste.
Lord Archer retained the support of Lady Thatcher but the libel case
consolidated a reputation for erratic behaviour which he has never been able
to shake off.
Lord Archer has remained an active politician, however, making hundreds of
speeches to Conservative supporters on the 'rubber chicken' circuit, and
throwing glittering political parties.
For a while he seemed on the way to full political rehabilitation, emerging
as a close friend of Mr John Major after he replaced Lady Thatcher in
Downing Street.
Mr Major, who admires Lord Archer's zest and loyalty, recommended him for a
peerage but has not succumbed to the temptation to give him a government
job.
In what looked like a last throw Lord Archer's friends reported earlier this
year that he would withdraw from active politics if he failed to win a
ministerial or party role in Mr Major's summer reshuffle.
Some Tories said Lord Archer would be a good junior minister in a relatively
unimportant portfolio such as sport, but it is unlikely that the prime
minister ever seriously considered giving him a job.
Senior MPs were hoping yesterday that Lord Archer would continue to campaign
for the party. But prospects of a return to government have been dashed by
the shadow cast over his political judgment by the Anglia revelations.
In the end, one minister said yesterday, Lord Archer was simply too
self-confident for his own good. 'Jeffrey is the classic Icarus,' he said.
'As far as his political career is concerned, this is RIP.'

FT  26 AUG 94 / Archer case review rejected
</HEADLINE>

   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday rejected Labour calls for a Crown Prosecution
Service review of the Department of Trade and Industry decision not to
prosecute Lord Archer for placing orders to buy Anglia Television shares.
Mr Neil Hamilton, the corporate affairs minister, said there was 'no case'
for a review of the decision by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry
secretary. The decision was 'wholly consistent' with advice from an
independent QC, taken by Mr Heseltine after he received a report on the deal
from DTI inspectors.
Mr Hamilton said in a letter to Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry
secretary: 'I therefore reject entirely any suggestion that this decision,
or indeed the decision to confirm the existence of the investigation, was
tainted by partiality.'
His letter followed an admission by Lord Archer, the Conservative peer and
best-selling novelist, that it was a 'grave error' to have placed orders to
buy shares in Anglia, of which his wife is a director, shortly before a
takeover bid.
Mr Cook said the letter left a number of unanswered questions about the
deal, including why Lord Archer did not use his usual broker.
He said: 'This is not a controversy that is going to go away quickly.
Michael Heseltine, or any other Tory minister, is not a proper person to
decide whether a senior Tory politician should face prosecution.
'So long as the decision on that is left to a Tory minister, the suspicion
will linger that political considerations played a part.'
It emerged yesterday that ministers and officials may be questioned on the
affair by the Commons trade and industry committee when parliament
reconvenes in the autumn.

<TEXT>
The RMT transport union last night accused Railtrack of employing a 'Dad's
Army' of retired signalling staff in its efforts to break the 11-week-old
rail strike.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said Railtrack planned to employ a
retired inspector at Birmingham New Street next Tuesday and had approached
other retired staff in a move which posed a threat to the safety of the
railway network.
He said: 'This issue raises serious safety questions. I assume any retired
staff will be medically examined as well as re-examined in rules and
regulations. How large this Dad's Army of former signalmen is remains to be
seen but I shall be writing to the chief inspecting officer of railways.'
Railtrack confirmed that it had signed up one recently retired signalling
manager who had taken early retirement in his mid-50s. It was looking to
re-employ retired staff in their fifties and not people past the retirement
age of 65.
Railtrack said: 'These are very senior people with very valuable experience
who would be very offended to be described as a Dad's Army. It is nonsense
to suggest we are employing 65-year olds.'
As well as retired staff Railtrack is expected to start using seconded
British Rail staff in its signal boxes during the planned 48-hour strike on
Tuesday and Wednesday of next week. BR said earlier that it was inviting
staff with signalling experience to help out, although the numbers involved
would be only about 100 at the most.
BR said it was unable to give numbers of those who had responded to its call
but some would start next week.
Mr Knapp yesterday urged Railtrack to return to negotiations about its claim
for a payment in recognition of past productivity improvements. He said if
Railtrack was worried about the reaction of the government to any settlement
he would be ready to help explain the deal to the transport secretary.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Norweb to shed 1,200 jobs in restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Norweb, the Manchester-based electricity company, is to shed 1,200 staff
over five years after announcing yesterday the sector's first corporate
restructuring following the recent regulatory review.
There are plans for further acquisitions in the US and the company may
refinance Keadby power station in Humberside, in which it has a 50 per cent
stake, and buy back shares through 'off-market' tenders involving
institutional shareholders.
The job cuts were attacked by union leaders, who contrasted them with the
pay and share options enjoyed by directors of electricity companies.
Mr Paul Gallagher, general secretary of the AEEU engineering and electrical
union, said he expected tens of thousands of jobs to go in the industry. He
said the directors of privatised power companies were greedy and out of
control.
Norweb's announcement came amid growing speculation in the City about change
in the sector, with takeovers, mergers and balance sheet restructuring all
considered as possibilities.
Shares of most of the 12 regional distribution companies in England and
Wales rose again yesterday, with Norweb up 17p at 822p.
Norweb said that its job cuts programme was necessitated by the regulator's
review of price caps which would lead to a cut in income of Pounds 300m over
the next five years, Pounds 40m of it next year.
It said it accepted the revised price controls even though it did not agree
with the the regulator's methodology and approach. Nine of the 12 companies
have agreed to the controls, and the other three are expected to do so.
Norweb is the only one of the companies which has not operated a redundancy
scheme until now, and has cut proportionally fewer of its staff than most.
It expects the introduction 'for a short period' of a voluntary severance
scheme to help it cut 800 of the 5,000 staff in its core electricity
businesses within 18 months.
A further 400 will follow, with the 1,200 total representing nearly a
quarter of the current core staff complement. Norweb employs another 3,000
in non-core businesses.
As part of the restructuring, five area offices will be replaced by three,
but Norweb said local customer services such as repairs would not be
affected.
It said the severance programme would cost Pounds 20m but because of
provisions made in previous years, profits would not suffer.
The company said the annual pay bill would be Pounds 25m a year lower at the
end of the century as a result of the cuts compared with Pounds 120m this
year.
Hinting at further investments in the US, Mr Ken Harvey, chairman, said: 'It
would be ludicrous to invest in a single power station in the US and then do
nothing else.'
The company is also considering whether to bring the financing of Keadby
power station on to its balance sheet. It estimates this could increase
gearing by about 15 per cent and lower costs.

FT  26 AUG 94 / IRA said to be near 'major decision'

<TEXT>
The head of an Irish-American delegation due to meet leaders of Sinn Fein
today said yesterday that he was 'renewed' in his belief that the IRA was on
the verge of a 'major decision', strengthening speculation that the IRA will
announce a ceasefire within two weeks.
Mr Bruce Morrison, a former US congressman, said after an hour-long meeting
in Dublin with the Irish prime minister and foreign minister that the
objective of his visit to Dublin and Belfast was to help achieve 'an end to
violence through a broad-based political process'.
Mr Morrison said: 'All political leaders should grasp the straws, whatever
they are, which lead towards peace . . . and try to take the steps which
will turn it into a permanent cessation.'
The Irish Foreign Ministry said the US delegation was briefed on the Irish
government's view of the peace process. It was stressed that the government
sought 'a total cessation of violence'.
Mr Morrison, considered a close friend of Mr Bill Clinton, the US president,
confirmed yesterday that he would report to the White House on his return to
the US.
In Belfast yesterday a senior figure in Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
IRA, said that an 'unprecedented opportunity to get down to the nuts and
bolts' of the conflict lay ahead, which he hoped would lead to 'multi-party
dialogue'.
Although unable to confirm whether an extended IRA ceasefire was imminent,
he said: 'The IRA know a short ceasefire was not seen as sufficient before.
They are moving towards a decision and no obstacles remain in the way at the
moment.'
He said Sinn Fein had invited the US delegation to meet the party's
leadership 'to help broker a permanent peace in Northern Ireland. We are not
looking for them to be behind Sinn Fein, but to be behind a strategy to get
a settlement.'

Total sales of engineering industries in Britain were 12 per cent higher in
the second quarter than in the same quarter last year, the Central
Statistical Office said yesterday.
Sales were 3.1 per cent higher seasonally adjusted in the second quarter
than in the first, with home sales 4.1 per cent up and exports 1.6 per cent
higher. Sales in June alone were valued at Pounds 7.3bn in current prices,
up from Pounds 6.8bn in May. Total orders on hand at the end of June,
seasonally adjusted and based on 1990 prices, were 0.9 per cent higher than
at the end of March, and 5 per cent up from June 1993.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Japanese plant in Wales to close
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Star Micronics, a Japanese manufacturer of dot-matrix printers, is to close
its factory in south-east Wales with the loss of nearly 200 jobs.
More than 40 Japanese companies have set up in Wales since the early 1970s.
This is the first Japanese plant to close.
Mr Shuku Masui, UK managing director, said yesterday: 'The reason for the
closure is purely commercial.' The company set up at Tredegar, Gwent, in
1988 but has faced severe competition from other types of printer. The
plant's turnover fell from Pounds 58m in 1990 to Pounds 20m last year, when
it lost Pounds 1.3m and cut 76 jobs.

FT  26 AUG 94 / MoD invites tenders for vessel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ministry of Defence yesterday invited tenders for a new ocean survey
vessel for the Royal Navy's Hydrographic Service from Swan Hunter, VSEL and
a consortium of BAe/Sema and Appledore shipbuilders.
Tenders for the vessel are due in October, for a decision by the end of the
year.
Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie, the sole prospective bidder for Swan
Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership, hopes Swans will win the
ship in order to provide the workload CMN requires before it is willing to
buy the yard.
Yesterday CMN, receiver Price Waterhouse and MoD officials met to try to
break the deadlock over terms for the proposed transfer of Swans' MoD
frigates contract to CMN, a key element in the company's proposal for a
conditional purchase deal. CMN described the talks as useful.
Last night the MoD confirmed that it had offered fresh proposals on the
price at which it would be prepared to transfer Swans' frigates contract to
CMN. The MoD said CMN had undertaken to give a decision today.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Milk sale delayed as row deepens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The row over milk trade deregulation deepened last night after the Scottish
Milk Marketing Board agreed to postpone only the second auction of milk
under a new system when bid prices rose to unexpectedly high levels, Michael
Smith writes.
The Scottish Dairy Trade Federation, which like its English counterpart is
protesting about the changes, said the move demonstrated the inability of
the deregulated system to produce realistic prices.
However, the SMMB said there was no compulsion on bidders to offer as much
as they had and said there was no plan to reform the system. The 2.2m litres
of milk unsold yesterday, representing about half the planned total, would
be auctioned later.
The postponement of the auction coincided with a meeting over the row
between Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, and the Milk Marketing
Board for England and Wales and the Dairy Trade Federation. The ministry
said last night that Mr Waldegrave had agreed to discuss the matter with
cabinet colleagues.
This week the DTF said it would challenge the government in court over its
handling of milk deregulation. Before the meeting yesterday Mr Waldegrave
said he did not rule out a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
In yesterday's auction for milk in December, prices varied from 27.1p to
30.7p. Dr Donald McQueen, SDTF chief executive, said they were artificially
high because of pressure on dairies to obtain the supplies they needed. 'The
whole system has been designed to push up prices.'

FT  26 AUG 94 / British Gas takes wraps off Morecambe terminal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas yesterday unveiled one of the main pieces of the costly
infrastructure needed to bring Britain's new west coast energy reserves to
market.
The Pounds 600m North Morecambe project, the UK's newest natural gas
terminal, will supply 4 per cent of the country's peak winter demand for
natural gas.
The terminal, outside Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, will be Europe's most
complex gas processing centre. It will be opened officially in October but
is already receiving gas from a single production platform about 25 miles
off the Lancashire coast.
The facility was built for the North Morecambe field but could be expanded
to take gas from other fields which may be discovered. The North Morecambe
field is seen by many oil companies as increasingly attractive for
exploration.
At the peak of activity up to 2,000 workers were employed to build the
terminal, one of the country's largest onshore energy projects. Hundreds
were still on site yesterday, although the permanent workforce will total
just 60.
The small size of the workforce reflects the success of UK oil and gas
companies in cutting the cost of large-scale energy projects.
British Gas's initial plan in 1980 envisaged an offshore platform two-thirds
the size of that on the nearby South Morecambe gas field, which has a crew
of 176.
But the final development plan, approved in 1990, called for the
installation of what company officials say is the world's largest fully
automated platform. It will not normally be manned, and will require only a
weekly maintenance visit from a 10-man team.
Officials say the design change was only partly due to technical advances.
As the company's UK gas monopoly was eroded competitive pressures forced
engineers to produce more cost-effective ideas.
The platform has no facilities for processing the raw gas. Nor does it have
its own power supply. Electricity is sent from shore via an undersea cable.
Mr David Lane, project manager, said the emphasis on cost reductions meant
that although the facilities were 'at the edge of technology, it is all
known and proven technology'.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Cross-Channel ferry blaze to be investigated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marine safety investigators from the UK and the Bahamas were last night
preparing to start inquiries into a fire on a cross-Channel ferry which led
to the emergency evacuation of more than 100 passengers and crew.
Lifeboats and rescue helicopters were called out to the Sally Star, a
9,000-tonne ferry en route from Dunkirk to Ramsgate after a fire broke out
in its engine room early yesterday.
One crew member had to be airlifted to hospital with a back injury, but no
one else among the 104-strong crew and 17 truck drivers on board was
injured. Fire officers from Kent were taken out to the vessel by helicopter
and boat.
The fire broke out when the vessel was eight miles from Ramsgate and flames
could be seen from the shore, a witness said. The Sally Star was last night
being towed back to Dunkirk for repairs.
The Department of Transport described the rescue as 'a textbook operation'
but the RMT transport union said the incident revealed the danger of recent
cuts in the emergency services budgets. The first helicopter to attend the
fire flew from an RAF base at Wattisham in Suffolk, following the removal of
helicopter rescue services from Manston in Kent because of defence budget
cuts.
The Sally Star can carry up to 625 cars and 70 trucks as well as up to 1,500
passengers, but was carrying only trucks and their drivers on the overnight
journey.
Sally Line, the owner of the vessel, said the cause of the fire was not
known. The Sally Star was built in 1981 and acquired by the line in 1988.
Ms Linda McLeod, Sally Line marketing director, said: 'The fire is out and
the ship is going to Dunkirk. She will be going into a yard where we will be
checking what caused the fire.'
The British marine accident investigation branch will start an investigation
because the ship was in British waters when the emergency occurred. The
Bahamian authorities will also investigate because it sails under the
Bahamas flag.
The Labour party yesterday called for an inquiry into safety standards on
ferries plying in British waters.
Fires broke out on two other vessels yesterday. Thirty of the 73 crew
members of the Lithuanian fish factory ship Seda were taken off by lifeboat
after an engine room fire off Shetland. In another incident, fire broke out
in the cargo pump room of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship Fort Victoria
moored near Plymouth.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Directors told to reveal financial control systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies are to be strongly urged to produce a statement describing their
internal financial controls from the start of next year.
Under draft guidelines issued yesterday directors will have to provide a
statement in the annual report and accounts stressing that they are
responsible for internal controls.
They will also be asked to provide a description of the key procedures used
by their company and how directors review the system of internal financial
control.
The guidelines were released by the working group on internal control
convened at the request of the Cadbury committee on the financial aspects of
corporate governance, comprising individuals from business and the
accountancy profession.
The Cadbury committee, which issued its report at the end of 1992, advised
companies to provide a statement of internal controls in their accounts,
which led to the creation of the working party.
Companies are not forced to comply, but any quoted business that does not
provide such a statement must note in its accounts that it fails to meet
this requirement of the Cadbury code on pain of reprimand from the Stock
Exchange.
The revised internal control guidance is significantly less detailed than an
earlier draft issued last year, which came under a barrage of criticism from
industry.
It no longer includes the suggestion that directors comment on non-financial
internal controls, or that they should provide an opinion on the
effectiveness of these controls.
The directors' statement should include the steps taken to ensure an
appropriate control environment in the company, the process used to identify
significant risks, the main information and control systems in place, and
the monitoring system used.
Mr Gerry Acher, head of audit at KPMG Peat Marwick, welcomed the simplified
new draft. He said: 'The subject of internal controls is best dealt with
between the auditor and the audit committee, not in a report. But the report
puts the onus on the audit committee to do its job.'
Comments on the draft proposals are invited before the end of October.

FT  26 AUG 94 / World Trade News: US business undeterred by Mexican unrest -
Rebellion and kidnapping south of border have failed to dispel optimism over
Nafta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rebellion, assassination and kidnapping south of the border have failed to
depress the optimism among US businesses engendered by the North American
Free Trade Agreement.
A survey in May by KPMG Peat Marwick, the US business advisory company,
found that while 97 per cent of senior corporate executives interviewed were
aware of political unrest in Mexico, 87 per cent said it would not influence
their companies' plans to conduct business there. More than a quarter said
they had set up, or planned to pursue, a joint venture or strategic alliance
with a Mexican company.
US Commerce Department officials are also unperturbed by the turbulence. The
energetic trade team working under Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, views
the integration of the North American economy under Nafta as both
unstoppable and a step towards economic integration of the hemisphere.
'There's no walking out on Nafta,' says Mr Jeffrey Garten, undersecretary
for international trade and the leading voice on the commerce trade team.
'This has to work. The implications of failure are dire for US trade policy
in general and the implications of a clear success are extremely positive.'
The growth in foreign direct investment, which doubled in the last decade
among the Nafta countries, has been slower than expected. But US officials
see the run-up to the Mexican election as 'a pause', with the pace now
expected to accelerate.
The US trade surplus with Mexico, which narrowed last year, has begun to
make a comeback. In the first six months of the year US exports shot up by
17 per cent to Dollars 24.5bn and government economists believe the Mexican
recovery will lift the trade surplus to at least Dollars 2.1bn in 1994, up
from Dollars 1.6bn last year.
'Some firms are responding through increased production and new investments
in their home markets while, for others, inter-firm agreements and strategic
alliances at the transnational level will generate a new regional dynamism,'
Mr Garten said.
Despite Mexico's economic and social woes, restructuring and expansion
continue:
Motorola and Mexico's Protexa are creating a Dollars 6bn telecommunications
company to serve long-distance and cellular customers in Mexico.
John Labatt, Canada's second largest beer company, and Femsa Cerveza,
Mexico's largest brewer, are merging their US units and marketing each
other's brands. John Labatt will acquire a 22 per cent stake in its partner
and a three-year option to buy another 8 per cent.
GTE of the US added Telmex, Mexico's telephone monopoly, to an already
existing partnership with Skytel Communications of Canada. The move will
expand GTE's air-to-ground telephone network to serve air passengers calling
business centres throughout North America.
Pilgrim's Pride, the fifth largest chicken producer in the US and second
largest in Mexico, has announced a 40 per cent expansion of its Mexico
operations.
Along with corporate changes there has been a continental restructuring of
transport flows. Mr Garten sees the emergence of north-south trade corridors
developing among all three Nafta countries. Trade flows in the developing
eastern corridor are expected to increase at an annual rate of 5-7 per cent
to 1997. Western traffic is expected to rise by 16-24 per cent over the next
10 years.
To liberalise trade further, the Nafta partners have established about 25
working groups charged with addressing problems left over from negotiations.
One group is identifying products for accelerated tariff reduction while
another is handling the issue of mutual recognition of professional
licences. The Nafta partners would then move on to harmonisation of legal
systems and policies on regulation, competition, taxes and exchange rates.
As far as labour is concerned, US unions, which conducted a full-scale
battle against Nafta, are no more enamoured with the pact than before.
According to the AFL-CIO, the umbrella organisation for US labour unions,
180 US companies have already made applications to states for assistance on
Nafta-related job losses. About 135 have been adjudicated and 62 companies
with 5,200 workers have been accepted as casualties of Nafta and thus
eligible for governmental assistance such as job retraining.
Meanwhile, the National Administrative Office (NAO) in the US Labour
Department has been set up to receive complaints by US unions about US
companies mistreating their Mexican workers. Three complaints have been
lodged - against General Electric, Honeywell and Sony.
However, Mr Greg Woodhead, chief economist on the AFL-CIO's trade task
force, said the NAO was understaffed and underfunded. A permanent director
was only recently appointed and seven months elapsed before the NAO
announced public hearings on the complaints it has received.
It is still unclear whether the administration is prepared to challenge
businesses which mistreat their Mexican workers, but a strong labour
movement would be more likely than a dozen bands of Zapatista rebels to turn
US companies off Mexico as a land of investment opportunity.

FT  26 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Fresh bout of pipeline politics fuels
scepticism - A Dollars 7bn gas shipment deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The signing in Tehran earlier this week of a Dollars 7bn deal to ship
natural gas from Turkmenistan to Europe via Iran and Turkey is the latest
example of the 'pipeline politics' being played out in the region.
Tehran radio reported on Wednesday that President Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani of Iran and President Saparmurat Niyazov of Turkmenistan dug a
symbolic hole for the proposed 4,000km pipeline at a site south of the
Iranian capital.
The plan calls for a gas pipeline with an initial annual capacity of 15bn
cubic metres to enter Iran east of the Caspian Sea, pass through the cities
of Shahrud and Semnan and bend south of Tehran towards Tabriz and the
Turkish border.
'This is one of the biggest energy transfer projects in the world,'
according to Mr Gholamreza Aqazadeh, the Iranian oil minister.
It would take six to eight years to build, with the Iranian section alone
costing Dollars 3.5bn. Tehran Radio quoted Mr Aqazadeh as saying that half
of that sum would be provided by Iran. Western analysts say the presence at
the ceremony of officials from Russia, Turkey and Kazakhstan lent a degree
of credibility to the proposal, one of many which have been put forward in
recent months to link western markets with the large energy reserves of
central Asia.
But many remain sceptical that two countries with such serious economic
problems will be able to arrange the international finance that would be
needed for such a massive project.
They also note that Turkey, Russia and Iran are all jockeying for political
and economic influence in central Asia, and that all have advanced competing
pipeline proposals.
'It seems more real now than a year ago,' said Mr Laurent Ruseckas, an
analyst at the Boston-based Cambridge Energy Research Associates. But he
noted that this week's ceremony was long on symbolism and short on details
of any cash commitments.
'The meeting benefited everyone politically without costing them anything,'
he added.
The Russians have a stranglehold over oil and gas export routes from the
former Soviet Union, a position they do not want to lose. But nor do they
want to take the blame for blocking the construction of alternative routes
from now independent former Soviet republics, according to Mr Ruseckas.
Turkey, which currently buys gas from Russia, has in the past favoured a
pipeline linking it to Turkmenistan via Azerbaijan. President Niyazov signed
a deal with Turkey and a consortium led by Enron, the US engineering group,
to consider the best route for a pipeline. But the deal, signed in November
1992 during a summit of Turkic states in Ankara, has come to nothing.
The accord envisaged a feasibility study of six possible routes, including
proposals to take the gas under the Caspian Sea from Turkmenistan's
Sovyetabad fields to Azerbaijan. The main alternative was through Iran to
Turkey, where it would link with Turkey's own gas network to Europe.
The consortium included the local Gama group and Botas, Turkey's state
pipeline company. However, the deal, along with much of the enthusiasm felt
by the Turks towards business opportunities in central Asia, has since
evaporated. One of the consortium partners said yesterday the negotiations
with the Turkmens had long since been called off.
The geography of the route agreed this week is such that it 'does make sense
in a perfect world,' said Mr Ruseckas.
Finding an alternative to its present export arrangement is a priority for
Turkmenistan, which last year accounted for about 3 per cent of the total
world gas production. Under the old Soviet system the country's gas went
mainly to Ukraine, Georgia and Azerbaijan, which since the break-up of the
Soviet Union have made only irregular payments. Debts owed to Turkmenistan
are thought to be about Dollars 1.4bn.
Gazprom, the Russian gas monopoly and large-scale exporter to western
Europe, makes an annual hard currency payment to Turkmenistan for gas which
enters the general Gazprom system.
But Russia's desire to expand greatly its own exports to western Europe
means that it is unlikely to accept bigger volumes from Turkmenistan that
could undercut its own export potential.
Tehran Radio said a number of meetings were due to be held over the next few
months to deal in detail with difficult issues such as pipeline tariffs. But
it may be some years before another hole is dug.

FT  26 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Swedish-UK groups win rail contract -
Go-ahead for controversial link to Stockholm's main airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
One of Sweden's biggest infrastructure projects was launched yesterday when
a SKr4.5bn (Dollars 584m) contract to build a controversial rail link
between Stockholm and the city's main Arlanda airport was awarded to a
Swedish-British consortium.
GEC Alsthom and Mowlem from the UK will be responsible for delivery of
trains, tracks and switches for the 20km link, while the Swedish companies
NCC, Siab and Kraftbyggarna will carry out the construction. Work will begin
next year and is expected to take four years.
The contract has been opposed by the opposition Social Democrats, the likely
winners of next month's general election, who have said they will try to get
out of it. The party wants a greater state involvement in the project.
Most of the financing will be private, although there will also be a
government grant and loan. The consortium partners are expected to put about
SKr700m of equity into the project and raise about SKr2bn in the capital
markets. Although the government will provide a SKr850m grant and a
conditional loan of up to SKr1bn, it will not guarantee the private-sector
fin-ancing.
The consortium says 4m passengers a year need to use the link by the year
2000 for it to break even. But the viability has been openly questioned,
given the extent of competition from bus and taxi services and good road
links.
Mr Mats Odell, Sweden's communications minister, said the project would have
significant environmental benefits, with much road traffic switching to
rail. If the state-owned Swedish railtrack and rail companies, Banverket and
SJ, had won the contract it would have cost taxpayers SKr3bn more, he added.
GEC Alsthom was involved with Mowlem in the Manchester Metrolink - the UK's
first privately financed rail project - and it was responsible for the
turnkey delivery of London's Dockland Light Railway. NCC is Sweden's largest
construction company in civil engineering.
The project will involve the construction of 20km of double-tracked railway
for high-speed trains, three underground train terminals at Arlanda, and
modifications to the central rail station in Stockholm. The consortium -
which beat a rival bid from Asea Brown Boveri, Skanska and SJ - has a
45-year mandate to operate the shuttle, although all fixed assets will be
handed over to the government in 1998.

FT  26 AUG 94 / China's golden era 'to last well into next century': But
while industrial progress is rapid, the way ahead is fraught with problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prof Li Jingwen's splendid vision of China for the next two decades is for a
'golden era of industrial revolution' which began 15 years ago and is likely
to last well into the next century.
But the 50,000-character study, prepared by China's prestigious Academy of
Social Sciences under Prof Li's direction, makes it clear that, while the
country is industrialising rapidly, the path ahead is also fraught with
difficulties.
China's main problem in achieving an enormously complex transition to a
modern industrialised state is managing its vast, unwieldy population which
is literally 'on the move'.
A huge displacement of surplus rural labour poses perhaps the greatest
threat to public order. Beijing is also under enormous pressure to find jobs
for a sea of unemployed peasants and urban youth.
'At present China has more than 100m surplus farm labourers, and every year
another 15m are added,' said Prof Li. If China was to absorb its unemployed
there was no choice but to maintain high rates of growth.
Prof Li, who is director of the Institute of Qualitative and Technical
Economics, said his team had focused not so much on statistics in its study,
but on discerning trends in society in the next two decades. Among the
academy's conclusions are:
China would remain a developing a country, but an increasing number of
Chinese would become middle-income earners like their counterparts in South
Korea and Taiwan;
Chinese savings rates at a forecast 34 per cent would remain high to the
year 2010;
Expenditure on 'non-food' items such as consumer durables would continue to
grow, relative to spending on staple commodities;
A wave of small towns and county centres would be established in the Chinese
countryside by the end of this century;
China would be obliged to grapple with increasing problems of an 'ageing'
population from the year 2000;
The trend towards smaller families would continue and divorce rates would
rise;
China's rapid economic development, averaging 8.25 per cent annually to
2010, would be fuelled by continuing high rates of consumption and
investment;
Heavy industry, including petrochemicals, would grow faster than light
industry and after that, service industries, including finance, would show
the swiftest growth;
Foreign investment would continue to pour into China, with a trend towards
larger projects involving 'multinationals', as the benefits of the country's
huge domestic market became more apparent;
China's exports would reach Dollars 435.7bn (Pounds 290bn) in 2010, a
quadrupling of the figure expected this year.
In urging strong measures to ensure orderly and sustained economic growth,
the study called for a strengthening of reforms of the taxation system to
increase revenues; an increase in interest rates to re-direct funds to more
productive sectors; further rationalisation of faltering state-owned
enterprises, and measures to prevent the outflow of capital.
The study, pointedly, devotes a chapter to environmental pressures, which
are looming as perhaps the most worrying consequence of China's continuing
'double digit' economic growth of 13 per cent in the past two years.
Prof Li said China was 'backward' in protecting its environment and huge
investment was required. 'Although the central government is doing a great
deal to improve environmental consciousness, it has met a lot of resistance
at the grass roots.'
The study forecast that for a 'relatively long period' the gap between
coastal and inland regions would 'grow larger'. But it also predicted that
six distinct economic regions would emerge in China. These were:
A south China economic sphere, with Guangzhou at its centre, and linked with
Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao;
A Yangtze economic sphere focused on Shanghai;
A Bohai rim centred on Beijing and Tianjin;
A north-east sphere based on Harbin;
North-west China bordering Central Asia;
A south-west region with Kunming at it focus and linked with south-east
Asia.
Prof Li said the academy was particularly concerned about the widening gap
between rich and poor.
'We have urged the government to take drastic measures to resist this trend
which is threatening to destroy the stability of society,' he added.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Nigeria oil depot in full operation
</HEADLINE>

   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Anglo-Dutch Shell, which operates about half of Nigeria's oil fields, has
restored the Forcados export terminal to full loading today, five days after
the power was disabled by striking oil workers.
Shell, which normally produces about 1m barrels a day of oil, has lost on
average half its production during the past three weeks of the six-week
strike by the two labour unions, Nupeng and Pengassan, which are demanding
an end to military rule.
Industry estimates show crude oil exports down by about 20 per cent. Overall
losses by the other producers are put at about 15 per cent.
Despite pressure from the government, no significant return to work by oil
workers has occurred. Last week the government sacked the leaders of the two
unions, legalising its action this week. The decree bans national and state
union leaders, although Nupeng and Pengassan do not have state leadership
but chapters for each oil company.
The chapters' leaders still exist and the oil producers are talking to them.
The coming week will be a test of the unions' leaders, who have gone
underground, and of the resolve of the ordinary membership to sustain a
strike with no end in sight.
The strikers want Mr Moshood Abiola, presumed winner of last year's
presidential election, freed from jail and installed in government. Mr
Abiola is on trial for alleged treason after declaring himself president.
The next hearing is due on Monday, before a new judge in the high court.

Israel's two chief rabbis, Ashkenazi Rabbi Yisrael Lau (right) and Sephardic
Rabbi Eliahu Bakshi-Doron (left) surrounded by Israeli army and border
police officers as they tour the grounds of the Tomb of the Patriarchs in
Hebron yesterday, six months to the day after the massacre of 30
Palestinians by an American-born Jewish settler, Baruch Goldstein. The
incident touched off months of bloodshed and disrupted the Middle East peace
process. The tomb, holy to both Jews and Moslems, has been closed since the
massacre. Both are demanding the site be re-opened. Hebron is one of the
most tense spots in the Israeli-controlled West Bank, as home to about
80,000 Palestinians as well as a Jewish enclave of 450.

<TEXT>
State-owned Farmers Bank of China has been added to a list of Taiwan
government-run companies designated for privatisation, Laura Tyson writes
from Taipei.
In a stock exchange listing set for November, the government will cut its
stake in the bank to 61.5 per cent from 92.3 per cent through an offering of
250m shares, a bank spokesman said.
Taiwan first announced a privatisation scheme in 1989 in which 22 state-run
companies would be sold off to raise Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13bn) for central
government coffers. But progress was set back by bureaucratic resistance,
workers' protests and a volatile stock market.
Just three state companies have been privatised to date - Chung Kuo
Insurance, BES Engineering and China Petrochemical Development.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Philippines court lifts freeze on VAT plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MANILA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Philippines Supreme Court yesterday ruled that a government-initiated
law expanding the scope of the value-added tax system was constitutional,
lifting a freeze it had ordered on its implementation nearly two months ago.
It was a significant victory for the government of President Fidel Ramos,
which considers the law the 'linchpin in the major tax reform programme' it
has been pursuing.
The ruling also removed the remaining obstacle to the government's
medium-term economic programme that recently gained International Monetary
Fund support with a three-year credit worth Dollars 684m (Pounds 456m).
The issue has been the most divisive in the Philippines in recent years,
fuelled mainly by suspicions that the new tax scheme would lead to huge
increases in consumer prices.
VAT was originally introduced in 1988, but only a few sectors were covered.
The system replaced 61 varying taxes with a 10 per cent charge on the sale
of certain goods and services.
In the expanded VAT, 73 taxes are to be replaced by the single 10 per cent
rate on services including telecommunications, road freight and other
transport, lease and sale of real estate, hotels and motels, books,
newspapers and broadcasting.
The law also allows VAT to be extended to banks and professional services
within the next two years.
Mr Roberto de Ocampo, finance secretary, had explained that the expanded VAT
system was aimed at 'injecting honesty' into the local tax system, often
characterised by evasion.
The Philippines' tax collection effort, about 15-16 per cent of gross
national product, remains the lowest in south-east Asia.
The go-ahead for the VAT expansion should give the government better chances
of collecting target revenues this year of 325.6bn pesos (Pounds 8bn), on
which it pins its hopes for a 4.5 per cent overall economic growth.
The contested law was originally scheduled to be implemented last July, but
several groups, including opposition legislators, challenged its legality
before the Supreme Court.
They claimed that much of the expanded VAT law in its final form originated,
not in the House of Representatives which, under the Philippines
constitution should initiate revenue regulations, but in a bicameral
conference committee.
In handing down its verdict, the Supreme Court said a revenue measure was
'not the exclusive prerogative' of the House to draft, but that the Senate
could draft its own bill amending or even substituting for the House
version.
The ruling was based on a 9-6 vote among the Supreme Court justices,
indicating the intense debates that went into it. Since July 1, the justices
have been meeting twice a week to deliberate on the case.

A recovery in Australian business investment finally got under way in the
second quarter of 1994, with new capital expenditure for the three-month
period showing a rise of 7.7 per cent in constant price terms.
This was higher than most analysts had predicted (most forecasts were around
the 5 per cent mark) and follows a fall of more than 5 per cent in the first
quarter. Spending on plant and equipment rose 14.4 per cent in real terms,
while spending on buildings was down 5.4 per cent.
The better-than-expected figures have come as a big relief to the federal
government.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Japanese capital spending continues to fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Domestic capital spending by Japanese companies remains on a downward trend
and may not recover even by the year which ends in March 1996, according to
an annual survey released yesterday by the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan.
Across all industries, planned outlays on plant and equipment were down 2.1
per cent for the year to March while initial expectations for the following
year indicated a further 1.7 per cent cut.
That would make a fourth consecutive year of decrease, although LTCB said it
saw 'a strong possibility that plans will be revised upward' next year, with
'some faint but positive signs' of recovery already beginning to emerge.
However, there was little chance that any extra funds committed would be
substantial, it added.
The poll of 1,869 companies, largely its own customers, produced a gloomier
outlook than a similar survey unveiled last week by Nippon Credit Bank,
another big lender to industry. NCB's data projected a dip of 1.1 per cent
this year and 0.9 per cent next.
Manufacturers polled by LTCB said they intended to cut outlays by an average
3.3 per cent this year but by a sharper 8.2 per cent in the 1995 fiscal
year. This largely reflected the contraction of old industries such as
steelmaking and pulp and paper.
Both banks identified a revival in expenditure by the automotive and
electric machinery sectors, but in each case commitments showed signs of
tapering off after this year. Electronics producers are benefiting from
strong world demand for semiconductors and liquid crystal displays, while
car makers began their capital investment cuts earlier than most.
In the service sector, excluding electric power and leasing companies, the
LTCB showed cuts in investment of 8.2 per cent this year moderating to 6 per
cent in the following term.
Overall, the bank said that 'unlike last year, which was marked by
consistent reductions, investment has clearly begun to recover in some
industries and stopped declining in others'. It also said the yen value of
domestic investment plans had been held down by cheaper raw materials and
land.
Reflecting wary consumer sentiment, meanwhile, nationwide department store
data for July yesterday showed a 1.8 per cent year-on-year decline, the 29th
successive monthly fall. But the Japan Department Stores Association said
less lavish corporate gift purchases were partly to blame. Clothing sales,
up 0.7 per cent, showed their first rise in two years.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Hyundai workers agree to end 63-day strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Workers at Hyundai Heavy Industries, South Korea's largest shipbuilder,
yesterday agreed to end a 63-day strike that could prove to be a watershed
in the country's labour history.
Analysts believe the conclusion of the strike may also signal the end of the
widespread labour militancy that has plagued South Korea since the trade
union movement was freed from state restrictions in 1987.
The industrial action at Hyundai was virtually the only long strike to
affect Korean business this year, in sharp contrast to the nationwide labour
unrest that embroiled the country just a few years ago.
Sizeable wage rises and dwindling public support have been the main factors
for the recent improvement in labour relations. Other trade unions once
known for their militancy, such as that at Daewoo Shipbuilding, have quickly
concluded pay agreements this year.
The strike at HHI confirmed the reputation of its workers for being the
country's most aggressive, an attitude bred by the company's past
authoritarian management practices.
But the strike exposed the dwindling influence of its union leadership. The
HHI union was previously able to trigger sympathy strikes at other Hyundai
companies, but failed this year to gain such support.
Moreover, the final days of the strike revealed a split in the HHI union,
with some workers rebelling against the leadership's hard-line stance. This
led to violent clashes between the rival factions.
In its final settlement with the company, the union made a significant
concession and agreed to accept the principle of no pay for no work. This is
considered an important victory for the government, which has promoted the
policy to curb strikes.
But the HHI workers will receive an 11.3 per cent rise in monthly pay and
generous bonuses that will mostly cover wages lost during the strike.
The company also agreed to drop criminal charges against 49 activists who
had led an occupation of the shipyard after executives ordered a lockout
earlier this month.
The company hoped the wage settlement will set a precedent for smoother
labour relations. The strike is considered the most costly in HHI's history,
with lost sales of Won473bn (Pounds 380m). HHI had set a sales target of
Won4,000bn for this year.
Labour unrest has occurred almost annually since 1987, with severe strikes
in 1989 and 1993, when sales losses amounted to Won300bn.

twin moves designed to attract greater capital from Indians living abroad,
Reuter reports from Bombay.
The measures were included in a circular to banks following last Friday's
move to make the rupee fully convertible on current account transactions.
The Reserve Bank of India said it would let non-resident Indian companies
acquire up to a 100 per cent of companies involved in housing, real estate,
urban infrastructure, such as roads and bridges, building materials and
financing of housing development.

<TEXT>
Bombay police yesterday increased security for the city's politicians,
following the shooting of Mr Ramdas Nayak, local president of the right-wing
Hindu Bharatiya Janata party and a strong critic of political corruption.
Mr Nayak, who was 53, was shot yesterday morning by two men on motorcycles
armed with automatic rifles who pumped 54 bullets into his car near his home
in central Bombay. Mr Nayak's police bodyguard was also killed.
Police believe Mr Nayak may have been killed by enemies in the criminal
underworld. His death follows a string of incidents in the past 18 months
which have highlighted connections between politicians and criminals in
Bombay.
First, the investigation into the terrorist bombings last March in which
more than 250 people died, revealed ties between some of the suspects and
city politicians. Next, in May this year, Mr Suneet Khatau, a wealthy
textile mill-owner with political influence, was shot in his Mercedes car,
allegedly because of a property dispute.
In July, Mr G R Khairnar, a senior civil servant at Bombay Municipal
Corporation, was suspended after he accused city politicians of corruption.
Mr Khairnar's suspension caused widespread public protests and boosted a
popular anti-corruption campaign.
This week, Mr Sharad Pawar, chief minister of Maharashtra state, which has
its capital in Bombay, and a former defence minister, was alleged in court
to have ties with the criminal underworld.
Mr Ulhas Joshi, a police deputy inspector-general, claimed in a sworn
affidavit that Mr Pawar had links with two named associates of Mr Dawood
Ibrahim, an underworld boss wanted for questioning by police investigating
last year's bomb blasts.
Mr Joshi is in court fighting an anti-corruption investigation against him
which he alleges was launched unfairly at the behest of Mr Pawar.
Mr Pawar yesterday dismissed Mr Joshi's claims as untrue.
Mr Nayak's killing was condemned by Mr L K Advani, the BJP's national
president.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Taiwan groups back Subic business zone

<TEXT>
Mr Richard Gordon, chairman of the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority, said
yesterday he had commitments from 135 Taiwanese companies to move into an
industrial zone which bills itself as the largest military base conversion
project in the world.
A Dollars 24m (Pounds 16m) loan from Taiwan is financing the development of
a 660-acre industrial estate on which the companies will be located.
Eighty-five companies, about half of them foreign, have already set up
businesses in Subic since the departure of the US military in 1992.
Five US companies, including AT&amp;T, Reebok and Federal Express, are the
largest investors in Subic, which is being developed as a significant Asian
trans-shipment freight hub.
Mr Gordon was in Washington for final discussions about a World Bank loan
totalling Dollars 40m for upgrading the Subic airport. Work is to begin next
month and will be completed in March, so that runways can take six cargo
shipments a day.
The US company Westinghouse has won a Dollars 6.2m contract to supply a
surveillance radar system so the airport can operate 24 hours a day.
The authority has been able to move its conversion plans quickly, because of
the efforts of 8,000 volunteers who protected the infrastructure and
facilities left behind by the US from theft and damage.
They worked for months without pay; their efforts have paid off in the
creation of 11,000 jobs thus far. 'The volunteers slew the myth that the
Filipino is dishonest,' Mr Gordon said. 'There were Dollars 8bn in
facilities left by the Americans. Today, they are all intact.'
President Ramos had set an example of unity by asking Mr Gordon, a former
mayor, to stay on in his job, although he was from a different party. 'Thus,
our people discovered a sense of community.'

FT  26 AUG 94 / Cuba hard line under fire: Democrats and Republicans
criticise Clinton

<TEXT>
The Clinton administration yesterday faced growing opposition from both
Republicans and Democrats over its refusal to talk with Cuban President
Fidel Castro about the growing number of Cuban refugees seeking entry to the
US.
Senator Chris Dodd, Connecticut Democrat and a member of the Senate foreign
relations committee, said 'some open negotiation with Castro makes sense.
It's anachronistic not to do it'.
His view was echoed by senior Republican Senator Richard Lugar who said 'the
administration is going to have to deal with Fidel Castro. . . in the same
hard-nosed way that we've tried to deal with Kim Il-sung and his successor
over in North Korea, or with the Chinese, or with other people we don't care
for'.
Mexico announced yesterday that it had formally offered to mediate between
Washington and Havana in an effort to reduce tensions over the developing
crisis in the Caribbean island, and had decided to accept a limited number
of Cuban refugees. Panama's incoming government also signalled it would be
prepared to accept US requests for the provision of temporary shelter for
boat people.
The US reiterated its refusal to begin comprehensive talks with Cuba, in
spite of President Castro's proposal of direct negotiations. In a speech
broadcast in both Cuba and the US on Wednesday night, Mr Castro blamed US
policies on Cuba, especially the trade embargo, for the refugees.
He proposed broad talks, including discussions of the trade embargo and the
US presence at Guantanamo Bay, to solve the migration problem.
Mr Peter Tarnoff, US undersecretary for state, said: 'Castro is trying to
make the US part of the problem and part of the solution. . . The problem
lies in Cuba. It's a result of direct mismanagement over the last 35 years,
(and) reluctance to reform.'
The US State Department continues to hope the numbers of Cubans attempting
to come to the US by boat will drop in response to the new immigration
policy announced last week which says Cuban refugees will never be processed
for entry into the US, but will be held in third-country detention camps
until they can be repatriated. Bad weather came to its aid yesterday by
stopping the flotilla of boats crossing the Straits of Florida.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Zedillo plans boost to pace of reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER and DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the victorious candidate in Mexico's presidential
election, has outlined plans to intensify political reform, saying he aims
to change the ruling party and make the country's election machinery
completely independent of the government.
Mr Zedillo said in an interview he intended to pursue dialogue with other
parties in an attempt to create a common political platform to advance
reform. 'I would like to see in the first place a direct dialogue with all
the parties and if possible, the candidates.'
The election proposals of the three main parties coincided in important
areas, he added. This should allow a common platform to be advanced in areas
such as the economy, social policies, judicial reform and democracy.
The opposition parties have yet to respond to Mr Zedillo's call. Mr
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the leftist opposition insists the election was
fraudulent, and observers dismiss the possibility of any common platform.
Mr Zedillo was 'in total agreement' with proposals to make the Federal
Electoral Institute, the Interior Ministry arm which runs Mexico's
elections, fully independent of the government.
After an election campaign in which the ruling party outspent its rivals and
received more TV coverage, Mr Zedillo said he was willing to discuss making
election campaign conditions more equitable.
Asked if he would include members of the opposition in his cabinet, he said
the Mexican constitution did not allow for coalition governments.
But 'I would not discount including independents or people belonging to
other political parties that could be of enormous utility or service in the
next cabinet.'
Sunday's voting had also given him a mandate to reform the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party and give it more internal democracy. 'I
don't think it's an insoluble problem. In the next few months, we are going
to be working at this.
'What I want before assuming the presidency is to leave some ideas for the
reform of the party, some terms of reference over the direction of this
reform.'
Part of this might eventually involve the PRI chairman being chosen by a
collective decision of the party, rather than by the president as at
present.
Mr Zedillo said the margin of his victory (the final figures suggest he was
23 percentage points ahead of his nearest rival) would not deflect him from
pursuing the reform.
He attributed his victory to three factors: the strength of the party, the
favourable evaluation of President Salinas's government, and the ruling
party's positive and intense campaign.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Higher rates continue to hit US home sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of existing homes in the US fell by 0.3 per cent in July from June,
the third consecutive monthly decrease, as demand for housing continued to
be squeezed by rising interest rates, the National Association of Realtors
announced yesterday, writes James Harding in Washington.
The drop in sales to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.95m units
follows a 3.6 per cent decrease in June and a 0.3 per cent fall in May.
Sales of previously owned homes have fallen in five of the seven months
since January as demand has been hurt by rising interest rates on mortgages,
triggered by rate increases from the Federal Reserve which has been
tightening credit to hold down inflation.
Although the resales rate was down in July from June, it was up 2.6 per cent
on the same period a year earlier. Mr Robert Elrod, president of the
National Association of Realtors, said he was encouraged that existing home
sales were higher than last year even though mortgage rates had risen.
'Apparently consumers realise that purchasing a home is still a sound
investment,' he said.
At the current rate, existing home sales this year would be the second
highest on record, despite fluctuations in mortgage rates, he added.
The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation reported the average commitment
rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages was 8.62 per cent in July, up from
8.43 per cent in June.
The national median price for an existing single-family home was Dollars
111,500 (Pounds 71,935) in July, down 1.2 per cent from the June figure of
Dollars 112,800.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Dual assault exposes Fujimori flaws: There is a bleaker side
to the 'economic miracle' in Peru
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bitter feud within Peru's first family continues to dominate the
country's political centre-stage - with President Alberto Fujimori this week
stripping his wife, Ms Susana Higuchi, of first lady status after she
persisted in allegations of corruption against cabinet ministers. Behind the
scenes, however, the agenda for next April's general elections is starting
to take shape.
Since his arrival in the Peruvian capital a week ago, Mr Javier Perez de
Cuellar, former UN secretary-general, has been closeted in meetings with a
series of prestigious economic analysts. Mr Perez de Cuellar has not yet
formally announced he will run against Mr Fujimori - who has also still to
declare an official candidacy - but his public addresses hint more strongly
each day at the substance of his eventual campaign.
The suggestion that an elderly former diplomat might pose a serious threat
to the buoyant Mr Fujimori provokes incredulity among many businessmen, both
Peruvian and among the increasing numbers of foreigners who are flocking
back to Peru to seize investment opportunities. 'Fujimori is the best
president this country's ever had,' said one leading Peruvian manufacturer.
'We couldn't be so incredibly stupid as to reject him.'
Indeed, most macroeconomic indicators suggest things are coming right for
long-beleaguered Peru. Inflation this year should be below 20 per cent, down
from a staggering 7,000 per cent when Mr Fujimori took office in 1990. After
expanding 7 per cent last year, GDP growth could top 10 per cent in 1994.
International reserves, at more than Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.2bn), are the
highest in Peru's history.
Equally important, after more than a decade of terror and killing, guerrilla
activity has virtually ceased. Mining and petroleum exploration and
development has been resumed in many remoter areas of the country while
dozens of foreign concerns are either returning or setting up Peruvian
offices for the first time.
But there is a bleaker side to the Peruvian 'economic miracle', which both
Ms Higuchi and Mr Perez de Cuellar have pinpointed. Only one in 10 Peruvians
of working age is judged 'adequately' employed; another eight survive
through subsistence agriculture or a host of 'informal' activities outside
the legal economy.
Reform of the bloated state apparatus has pushed tens of thousands of former
civil servants and state company employees on to the street, literally. They
have swollen the army of informal vendors eking out a living in the centre
of Lima.
For the 300,000 or so young people who join the national workforce each
year, the task of finding secure employment is all but hopeless.
Attending to the nation's poor has not, so far, been a priority for the
government. In the early days of the Fujimori administration, as food
subsidies and price controls were eliminated, the need to re-establish a
working relationship with the multilateral organisations was more urgent.
Repayments to the International Monetary Fund and World Bank cost the
Treasury in a month what the social emergency programme doled out in a year.
More recent efforts to create a 'compensation' programme similar to that
designed for post-stabilisation Bolivia have been only partially successful.
The Foncodes fund has for the past two years been channelling cash to
community projects, focusing on small building projects, drinking water and
sewerage systems.
Now, in this pre-election year, the government finds itself swimming in cash
from privatisations. The IMF has authorised spending of up to Dollars 876m
on 'social' programmes. But Foncodes does not have the organisational
capacity to spend more than about Dollars 120m. Other hastily hatched plans
to funnel more money into health posts and schools may succeed in spending
about the same amount again.
Multilateral organisations such as the World Bank and the Inter-American
Development Bank which have resumed lending to Peru are pouring money into
upgrading infrastructure. Several hundred million dollars will, by 1995,
have been pumped into road and bridge repairs; poverty alleviation is
limited to, at best, inadequate food handouts and short-term palliatives.
Ms Higuchi has emerged in recent weeks as one of Mr Fujimori's harshest
critics amid the couple's highly public falling out, fuelling rumours that
she harbours political ambitions herself. She has made a series of attacks
on her husband's regime, accusing him of personal authoritarianism and
neglect of the 'human factor' in the economic programme.
'There is too much emphasis on infrastructure,' Ms Higuchi said. 'The head
of a household can't promise a fine mansion but keep his family starving
whilst it is being built.'
Those close to Mr Perez de Cuellar say his eventual campaign platform will
echo this theme and propose reorienting Peru's economic programme to
farther-reaching solutions to unemployment and poverty. This would imply
tougher negotiations with the IMF, World Bank and IADB and, possibly, a halt
to the breakneck privatisation of state assets.
'So far no one's taken a long hard look at where Peru is going,' says Mr
Francisco Sagasti, a former senior World Bank official now heading a Lima
research institute. 'Pulling the neo-liberal economic model back to the
centre from the extremes where it's been for the past four years and
renegotiating with the multilaterals would make a lot of sense.'

FT  26 AUG 94 / Kohl issues his election manifesto: Chancellor launches
campaign for a fourth term in office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday launched his campaign to be re-elected for
a fourth term, presenting himself as the defender of unity, peace and
stability against an emerging left-wing front led by the Social Democrats.
Speaking at the unveiling of the election manifesto for the senior coalition
parties - his own Christian Democratic Union and finance minister Mr Theo
Waigel's Christian Social Union - Mr Kohl declared that Germany had found
its place among 'the winners for the first time this century'.
He told a press conference: 'For the first time in the history of our
country, we have good relations with Washington, Paris and London.'
The representation of Mr Kohl as broker and defender of international
harmony is to be hammered home in a personalised advertising campaign
featuring him and world leaders with Tina Turner's song 'Simply the best'
pounding in the background.
One commercial includes President Bill Clinton's quote from his recent
visit: 'I agree with Helmut.' One poster shows only Mr Kohl's bulky figure
in a crowd, and is embellished neither with the CDU's black red and gold
party logo, nor a slogan.
According to the manifesto, it is up to the electorate to decide if Germany
should stay in the political centre or should 'drift away far to the left'.
It describes the SPD and their Green allies as a 'security risk' at a time
when dependability and security are needed more than ever.
Mr Kohl pressed home the charges against the SPD, claiming Saxony-Anhalt's
new regional government, in which a minority SPD/Green government is
supported by the Party of Democratic Socialism, represented a 'basic
qualitative change' in SPD policy. The PDS was communist and communists were
'fascists painted red', Mr Kohl said.
'We want enough votes to ensure that what happened in Saxony-Anhalt is
unthinkable in Bonn,' added Mr Waigel, urging a strong turnout at the poll
on October 16.
The manifesto document itself dwelt heavily on domestic concerns. There were
promises to be hard on crime and generous with housing programmes and family
taxation. There were assurances on maintaining the economic recovery, and
long passages on plans to complete the process of unification with the
former East Germany.
As Mr Waigel pointed out, it contained 'no promises which are unrealistic or
which we cannot keep'. Accordingly, the manifesto offered no eye-catching
tax reliefs for an electorate which will next year feel the pinch from the
reinstatement of a 7.5 per cent income tax surcharge.
This so-called 'solidarity' levy was introduced shortly after unification,
following repeated reassurances from Mr Kohl that taxes would not need to be
increased to support the east German economy.
When the vote had been won he would give the fair distribution of the tax
burden 'great priority', the chancellor said.
Referring to a proposal from Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the Free Democrat economics
minister, that federal borrowing should be increased to fund tax cuts, Mr
Kohl said bluntly: 'It is not feasible.' Despite emerging differences with
the junior government partner, Mr Kohl said he wanted to resume control with
the present coalition.

<TEXT>
Eastern Germany's industrial output rose by 15 per cent in June compared to
the same period in 1993 and by 5.3 per cent compared to May, the federal
economics ministry announced yesterday. It said seasonal factors had helped
to boost overall output. However, output in individual sectors was mixed.
Manufacturing recovered strongly, up 21.5 per cent year-on-year, and by 6.7
per cent between May and June. Construction, one of the most buoyant
sectors, rose 14 per cent and 8 per cent over the same periods. Output in
the electricity and gas sectors increased only by 3.4 per cent year-on-year
and fell by 6.7 per cent between May and June. The mining sector, mostly
brown coal, or lignite, fell by 13.6 per cent year-on-year, and rose 4.4 per
cent in June compared to the previous month.
Consumer spending in the Netherlands rose 1.5 per cent in real terms in the
second quarter from last year, the Dutch Central Bureau for Statistics said
yesterday. That gain was sharply narrower than the 2.8 per cent real
increase in the first quarter.
France's current account showed a seasonally adjusted surplus of FFr1.14bn
(Pounds 130m) in May after a revised FFr2.75bn surplus in April, the economy
ministry said.

<TEXT>
The German federal office for the regulation of property questions, set up
to deal with outstanding property rights claims in eastern Germany from the
Nazi and Communist eras, yesterday said it had settled 38 per cent of all
claims by last June, excluding enterprises. More than 43 per cent of all
claims for businesses had also been settled. The office, which expects to
take 10 more years clarifying the rest, originally registered 1.248m claims
for 2.8m property titles. Berlin and Saxony-Anhalt have resolved only 20 per
cent and 31 per cent respectively of all enterprise claims largely because
both regions had sizeable Jewish communities, and it has been difficult to
trace descendants. Saxony, with 62 per cent, has the highest rate of
settlement among the eastern states.

Turkey's central bank yesterday moved to quell recent currency turbulence by
raising interest rates to 240 per cent from 70 per cent in the overnight
market. Before trading opened yesterday, the lira had lost around 11 per
cent against the dollar in two days. The nervousness follows three months
when the lira had been steady at around TL31,000 to the dollar, and interest
rates had been moving down. The central bank's official opening price
yesterday was TL35,291 to the dollar. After the Central Bank move, the rate
had steadied to around TL34,000. The uncertainty resulted as traders moved
to anticipate a large repayment of government bonds, issued initially at
rates as high as 400 per cent as the government sought to finance its
budget.

<TEXT>
The French government confirmed yesterday that it would decide by
mid-September whether and how much of the state's 80 per cent holding in the
Renault car group to sell off, amid signs that Mr Edouard Balladur, prime
minister, might keep 51 per cent in state hands to appease the unions.
Renault's possible sale is caught up in conflicting pressures from the prime
minister's office, which wants to apply the brake in the interest of
maintaining labour peace, and from the industry ministry, which is pressing
the accelerator for the car group's launch into the private sector. The
ministry is keen on privatisation before November 30 to take advantage of
favourable disinvestment arrangements agreed with the Swedish car-maker
Volvo.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission is set to recommend the introduction of automatic
interest charges on bills that are paid late. The aim is to curb a
lengthening of payment periods, which it concludes is hampering both the
internal market and cross-border trade. In a draft report, the Commission
points to a deterioration in payment discipline, which saw the time between
the delivery of goods and payments rise to an average of 66 days in Europe
in 1993. More than a quarter of businesses have to wait more than 90 days
for payment; 8 per cent wait for 120 days. The Commission also recommends
the introduction of compulsory reporting by companies of their own payments
records, together with statements of how they tend to improve their
performance. The report is likely to come as something of an embarrassment
to the British government, which just three months ago, in its white paper
on competitiveness, announced its decision not to introduce legislation to
give companies a statutory right to interest on overdue debts. The UK argued
there was no clear mandate from the business community for such a measure.
The Commission argues that late payments are proving so damaging to European
businesses that action needs to be taken.

Fifty thousand Russian coalminers and their families will be resettled by
the government as their mines in northern Siberia are closed, senior coal
industry officials said yesterday. The miners live in settlements where the
pits are the only source of employment, and have little possibility of
finding alternative employment if the government resists pressure to bail
out failing state enterprises with inflationary soft loans. Mr Yuri
Malyshev, head the state coal producers' association, said 50,000 miners and
their families from the settlement of Vorkuta and the northern region as a
whole would be resettled over the next few years. However, so far only 500
families have been resettled in more hospitable southern areas. Russian coal
production was down 12 per cent in the first half of this year compared with
last year. Two thousand Russian farmers, members of the Agrarian party, and
communists demonstrated yesterday against President Boris Yeltsin and his
government, saying ill-conceived reforms were wrecking agriculture and rural
life.

<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Santer, incoming European Commission president, plans a more
open, less autocratic style of leadership and a wide-ranging internal
shake-up when he succeeds Mr Jacques Delors next January. Officials close to
him say he wants a more collegiate approach, ending Mr Delors' practice of
concentrating power in an inner circle and creating an underground network
in the bureaucracy. The long-time Luxembourg premier's task is being made
harder by member states' delays in putting forward candidates for
commissioners and rivalry over portfolios. In France, arguments persist
about suitable candidates. Former prime minister Edith Cresson would be
welcomed as a political heavyweight, though French claims to the external
trade portfolio are being resisted by the UK which wants Sir Leon Brittan to
retain it. Brussels officials are also worried that referendums on EU
membership in Finland, Sweden, and Norway could force delays in agreeing a
division of the Commission spoils. If enlargement goes ahead, the number of
commissioners will rise from 17 to 21 (including Austria). Mr Santer is said
to be confident enough work can be found, but others are doubtful.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Pension reform a key to Italy's budget problems: Andrew Hill
reports from Milan on a move which would not only yield much needed savings
but represent, in theory at least, a permanent structural change in the
country's public finances
</HEADLINE>

Two blind Italians have just come under police investigation. One is
apparently a sharpshooting huntsman; the other drives a van for the local
education authority. Both claim a state disability pension and an allowance
for a sighted companion, which is good news for other drivers, but bad for
ducks and the Italian Treasury.
They are among the first targets of a nationwide sweep to eliminate
widespread fraud in the state's invalidity pension scheme. They are also
being cited by Italian ministers and the media as symbols of Italy's state
pensions crisis.
Pensions reform is by no means the only challenge facing Mr Silvio
Berlusconi's government as it returns today from a short summer holiday. But
analysts believe it may be the key to unlocking the central problem of
Italy's public finances, posed by Mr Lamberto Dini, the Treasury minister,
before the summer break: how to cut the budget deficit to L138,600bn (Pounds
57bn) or 9.4 per cent of gross domestic product next year, compared with
L154,000bn (Pounds 63bn) estimated for this year.
The government needs to find L45,000bn over the next year by raising revenue
and cutting spending. According to one undersecretary at the Treasury, that
figure could rise to more than L50,000bn, because of the additional cost of
financing the national debt following the half-point rise in interest rates
earlier this month.
Mr Dini outlined some of the likely budget measures in July. They include an
amnesty on the backlog of tax assessment cases which could generate
L15,000bn of new revenues, and a similar pardon for buildings constructed
without proper planning permission which could raise a further L5,400bn.
The significance of pensions reform in this complicated equation is not that
it could supply a further L7,000bn-L8,000bn of savings in 1995, but that it
would represent, in theory at least, a permanent structural change in
Italy's public finances.
The bare statistics supplied by INPS, the national pension fund, illustrate
the extent of the problem. According to figures released earlier this year,
INPS expects to pay out L250,973bn in pensions and social assistance for
1994, while receiving only L178,823bn. The shortfall is covered by transfers
from the Treasury, which helps explain why Mr Dini was one of the only
government ministers not to take any summer holiday.
Industry and investors are pressing for swift and decisive action to tackle
the problem. 'What's needed is an across-the-board solution based on strong
principles of equity for everybody,' said Mr Stefano Micossi, head of the
research unit of Confindustria, the Italian employers' federation,
yesterday.
Such a solution, according to Treasury sources, would require an end to a
number of obvious anomalies in the Italian system.
Fraud. This is the area where there is probably the greatest consensus,
although there are differences of opinion about the extent of the problem
and whether it should be solved, like other fraud problems inherited from
Italy's corrupt old system, with an amnesty for blind drivers and their
like.
Pensionable age. Mr Giuliano Amato, when prime minister, proposed a
harmonisation of pensionable age to 65 for men, and 60 for women - but only
by 2002. This is too slow, Treasury sources suggest, especially as workers
in different sectors are entitled to retire at different ages.
The yield for calculating pensions. Italians accumulate pension provisions
at a faster rate than do citizens of most other European countries - 2 per
cent a year. Thus, after only 15 years of contributions, Italians are
already entitled to a pension worth 30 per cent of their average salary in
the final years of employment. The average figure in France is 1-1.3 per
cent, and in Germany 1.5 per cent.
Pensions paid to workers. Certain pension benefits continue to be paid to
workers who retire from one job, only to start a second career, for example
as self-employed shopkeepers.
Even if all these problems are solved, the government may still have to find
a way to deal with a constitutional court ruling earlier this year, which
could oblige the state to pay more than L30,000bn to top up existing
pensions. Perhaps sensibly, the Treasury is waiting for confirmation of the
legal position before acting.
The difficulty for the Treasury in tackling the basic anomalies is that the
prospect of cutting pension benefits is highly sensitive. Mr Clemente
Mastella, Italy's labour minister, hinted in a newspaper interview published
on Tuesday, that indiscriminate cuts would bring angry pensioners into the
piazza to protest. Labour unions are also keeping an extremely close eye on
the plans, and the Treasury itself is likely to propose at first a range of
solutions to the problem to avoid inflaming the first cabinet discussion.
In the past few days, however, the tone of the pensions debate has calmed
somewhat. For one thing, the government has made it clear that there will be
no attack on pension rights accumulated under the existing, albeit
extravagant, system. Mr Mastella has also adopted a more sombre tone,
warning that everybody will have to make sacrifices.
Mr Berlusconi's chief of staff said yesterday that public finances would not
be on the formal agenda of today's cabinet meeting, but Treasury sources
indicated that the government will be looking to submit a 1995 budget to
parliamentary scrutiny well before the end-September deadline. Amid the
political brouhaha, Mr Dini is certain of one thing: any delay is likely to
be pounced on by the political opposition, and by the markets.

Mr Leonid Kuchma, Ukraine's new president, yesterday rounded out his circle
of advisers by naming a new foreign minister. Mr Gennadi Udovenko, whose
appointment awaits parliamentary approval, was Ukraine's permanent
representative to the UN while Ukraine was still part of the Soviet Union,
and has been Ukraine's ambassador to Poland since 1991. This week Poland and
Ukraine announced efforts to promote trade by improving transit links
between Odessa on the Black Sea and Gdansk on the Baltic sea. With
parliament in recess, in the last two weeks Mr Kuchma has also appointed Mr
Yuri Yahenrov to run Ukraine's faltering privatisation programme and Mr
Serhei Osyka as minister of foreign economic relations. These appointments
have been welcomed by Kiev's business community.

Romanian police said yesterday they had detained the owner of the collapsed

millions of people. Former bookkeeper Mr Ion Stoica was brought to Bucharest
on Wednesday from the Transylvanian city of Cluj, where angry savers have
been campaigning to have him brought to trial. 'Stoica is accused of crimes
listed in the financial law as inexact listing of book keeping documents,
falsifying bankruptcy, forgery and fraud,' a police statement said. Caritas
collapsed last year after attracting an estimated Dollars 1bn in investments
from up to 4m Romanians.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Moscow stalks Chechens' rebel state: The mountain region's
independence looks increasingly shaky
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The embattled government of the break-away Russian region of Chechnya
brought thousands of supporters by bus to the capital Grozny yesterday to
defend its stand against political challenges from Moscow and armed local
rivals. This was all very well, except for the 10,000 people gathered at an
opposition rally 5km away, celebrating - mistakenly - the supposed
resignation of President Dzhokhar Dudayev.
Nearly three years ago, the Chechens, a mountain people in the Caucasus
renowned for their fierce military traditions, asserted their independence
from Russia with Mr Dudayev, a charismatic former Soviet air force general,
as their leader. Over the past few months, however, the sovereignty of the
increasingly impoverished region, and Mr Dudayev's rule, have been
threatened as Moscow has sought to bring the rebels to heel and internal
opposition has grown.
'Russia still wants to enslave us,' Mr Dudayev - clearly still in office -
told about 3,000 supporters gathered yesterday in Grozny's central square.
'Russia has declared there can be no free republic inhabited by free
people.' Some 15 black-clad presidential guards, their Kalashnikovs at the
ready, stood on a balcony above Mr Dudayev as he spoke while dozens of his
backers in the square below broke into the frenetic dancing, chanting and
drumming of the mystical Islamic Sufi sect. 'We are dancing in support of
Dudayev and the sovereignty of the country,' said Mr Akhmad Makhmudov, a
local Islamic religious leader.
At about the same time, in the nearby town of Sunzha, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov,
the former leader of the Russian parliament who was ousted last year after a
bloody power struggle with President Boris Yeltsin, declared that Mr
Dudayev's government had been dissolved.
An ethnic Chechen who has returned to his homeland in an effort to launch a
political comeback, Mr Khasbulatov made his claim at a rally of heavily
armed opponents to Mr Dudayev's regime. Among their weapons were two Russian
army helicopters. Some opposition leaders have said they have been armed by
Russian military.
The two political rallies came against a backdrop of an increasingly tense
tug-of-war between a Russian government trying to keep the federation
together, and the maverick Mr Dudayev. Over the past three years the Chechen
leader has repeatedly challenged Moscow's suzerainty over his oil-rich north
Caucasus republic, and in the past month Mr Yeltsin has stepped up pressure
to topple him.
Local analysts do not expect Mr Dudayev to be ousted soon but they say his
conflict with Russian-backed opposition forces is coming to a head.
The power struggle is complicated by the intricate clan-based loyalties
which dominate local politics, and the region's unforgiving warrior
traditions. One product of this culture is Mr Ruslan Labazanov, a
26-year-old warlord who appears to have taken control of a region 100km
north of Grozny.
Formerly a Dudayev supporter, he declared a blood feud against the president
last month and has now emerged, seemingly heavily armed, in support of Mr
Khasbulatov.
Mr Dudayev's regime has been marked by his reliance on armed force and the
effective support it has enjoyed from a powerful, locally based mafia which
reaches into Moscow, other areas of Russia and even western Europe. Mr
Dudayev has also successfully tapped his people's deep-seated hostility
towards Russia based on a centuries-old struggle for independence and on
Stalin's mass deportation of Chechens to Central Asia after the second world
war.
Russian government efforts to unseat Mr Dudayev, which include a fierce
rhetorical attack in the media but have fallen short of direct military
intervention, have increased as lawlessness has spread from Chechnya to
other areas of southern Russia.
A turning point for Russian public opinion came last month when Chechen
nationals kidnapped several people in the nearby Caucasus city of Mineralnye
Vody. Five of the hostages were killed in the rescue attempt.
Russian officials have accused Mr Dudayev of providing a sanctuary for
Chechen gangsters and have claimed that Chechnya is a country run by and for
criminals.

FT  26 AUG 94 / French rivals wave their flags: Fireworks - and politics -
mark commemoration of Paris liberation
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The successors of General Charles de Gaulle yesterday used the commemoration
of the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Paris to promote their rival
presidential bids, with Mr Jacques Chirac wrapping himself firmly in the
mantle of the late general and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur presenting
himself as the unity candidate representing all conservatives.
Their language was inevitably coded, given the nature of the occasion and
the fact that neither is yet a formal candidate. The French press, however,
was quick to interpret Mr Balladur's citing of the call of General Leclerc,
whose French division freed Paris, for an end to 'fractious divisions' as
reflecting the prime minister's own strategy to unite the centre-right
behind him. It saw in Mr Chirac's fulsome repetitions of De Gaulle's
commentaries on the events of 50 years ago an attempt to ensure that the RPR
neo-Gaullist party lines up behind him.
This commemorative summer of wreath-laying and speech-making about the final
year of the second world war, taking French dignitaries and Resistance
veterans to the beaches of Normandy in June and Provence earlier this month,
has been largely free of internal politicking. But at these earlier
ceremonies Mr Chirac and Mr Balladur were both said to have felt that
President Mitterrand somewhat underplayed the role of the French Resistance,
and thus saw in this week's events in Paris a chance to redress the balance.
Both, however, have vied to be the one to do the redressing. As mayor of
Paris, Mr Chirac has been busy at centre stage, though taking time off to
give interviews this week complaining that successive Gaullist governments -
and by implication Mr Balladur's - have lost sight of the 'social goals' of
the revered general. Not to be left entirely in the wings, Mr Balladur is
today giving his own reception for Resistance heroes.
The celebrations climaxed yesterday with a procession taking the route into
the city of Gen Leclerc's armoured divsion, in a repeat of the feat of the
lone fireman who climbed the Eiffel Tower to hoist the tricolour, and in a
mass fete on the Place de la Concorde preceded by chain explosions of
fireworks along the bridges of the Seine. Today sees Gen de Gaulle's march
down the Champs Elysees commemorated.
The progression of the liberators through Paris was last night marked by a
firework spectacular successively lighting up the city's bridges,
symbolically detonated by water-skiers passing under them. The peaceful
explosion of the 10 tonnes of fireworks was an indirect reminder of the
explosives the Germans placed on the main bridges and buildings 50 years ago
and which Hitler ordered to be detonated.
But for the mediation of an exceptional Swedish consul, Raoul Nordling, and
the Nelsonian blind eye that the German commander, Gen Dietrich von
Choltitz, turned on Hitler's orders, Paris might have met the fate of Warsaw
whose uprising and buildings were destroyed three weeks earlier, while
nearby Russian troops stood by. Gen Leclerc's US superiors wanted to push on
without being distracted by freeing and feeding Paris, and thus only gave
him the go-ahead to march on Paris three days after the uprising had
started.
Had this delay been fatal to Paris, it would have turned the
chip-on-the-shoulder that some French still bear about having their country
liberated by the 'Anglo-Saxons' into a deeper emnity like that between many
Poles and Russians. As it turned out, there was nothing to mar the welcome
for Allied troops following Gen Leclerc - and Ernest Hemingway - into Paris.
Last night the Ritz Hotel unveiled its bar revamped in honour of the
American writer who 'liberated', and drained, it on August 25, 1944 and who
later said his dream afterlife was always the Paris Ritz.

FT  26 AUG 94 / China faces exodus from countryside to cities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China faces an urban explosion in the next two decades with a massive
population shift from rural areas to cities and new townships, according to
a study prepared by one of the country's most respected academic
institutions.
China's Academy of Social Sciences forecasts that by 2010, the country's
urban population will grow from 27.6 per cent of the total population to 50
per cent.
The startling urbanisation projection suggests that China, which has
hitherto been predominantly an agrarian society, is undergoing a
sociological revolution even more profound than has been recognised.
Entitled 'Policy Choices of China's Economic Development', the study calls
for a rapid small town development programme to provide homes and jobs for
peasants leaving the land 'as cities have reached their limit in taking
farmer-migrant workers'.
Such rapid urbanisation would clearly have serious consequences for the
environment in the world's most populous country, and would also suggest a
revolution in consumer habits and lifestyles throughout China.
The academy, which frequently acts as a 'think tank' for the government,
predicts that China's economy will grow by an average 8.25 per cent a year
to 2010 and will become 'one of the world's largest'.
Government officials are wary of claims that China is becoming the world's
biggest economy. They are concerned that such recognition may jeopardise
trade and other benefits accruing to a developing country.
This has been one of the central issues in negotiations over China's entry
to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The government-commissioned study expects that, if average annual growth of
8.25 per cent is maintained, China's gross domestic product will more than
quadruple by 2010. But, as the study makes clear, the country will need to
maintain exceptionally high growth rates to cope with surging demand for new
jobs.
'Each year,' it says, 'China needs to create 17m-18m new jobs, 3m-4m
annually more than in the 1980s.'
The study, prepared by the Institute of Qualitative and Technical Economics
within the academy, estimates surplus rural labour at between 100m and 120m.
The bloated state-owned sector employs 140m, many of whom are believed to be
surplus. Cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Tianjin have
already been overrun with migrant labourers from the countryside.
The influx has been blamed for an increase in crime and has stirred fears
within the government about social unrest.
The study predicts that the gap between the prosperous coastal regions and
the hinterland will continue to widen, but it also forecasts a 'wave effect'
of new foreign investment into more remote areas.
The academy predicts that China's population will rise from 1.17bn at
present to 1.3bn in the year 2000, 1.4bn in 2010 and 1.6bn in 2050, which it
predicts will be the peak.

FT  26 AUG 94 / CBI reports rise in output but warns on prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK manufacturing output and orders are growing at their fastest rates since
the late 1980s, according to the latest Confederation of British Industry
monthly trends inquiry, but expectations of higher prices are increasing.
For the first time since April 1989, more companies believe their order
books are above normal, than below. The findings appear to confirm official
statistics earlier this week which showed that the rate of economic growth
was accelerating and would beat the Treasury's 2.75 per cent forecast for
1994.
CBI surveys deduct those reporting a decrease from those reporting an
increase to produce a percentage balance.
The balance of those expecting an increase in output over the next four
months is 30 percentage points, the highest figure since September 1988,
while the balance of those reporting above normal order books is 4
percentage points.
Financial markets are likely to watch the figure on price expectations with
the most interest, as it is seen as an important indicator of inflationary
pressures. The balance of companies expecting to raise prices over the next
four months has edged steadily up from April, and reached 15 percentage
points in August, from 12 percentage points in July. Some analysts predicted
the price expectations balance would fall from July's figure and the
increase may renew fears of a rise in base rates.
However, the CBI points out 65 per cent of companies still believe that
prices will be unchanged over the next four months, and only one in four
expects to make an increase.
The CBI also produced its revised economic forecast for 1994 and 1995. It
has upgraded its expectations for gross domestic product growth this year
from 2.4 to 3 per cent, although that forecast does not take account of the
strong GDP figures published earlier this week.
The CBI believes economic growth will slow in the second half of this year,
as the full impact of tax increases hits consumer spending, and GDP growth
in 1995 will drop back to 2.5 per cent.
The CBI believes there is no need for an immediate rate increase following
the next meeting between the chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, and the governor
of the Bank of England, Mr Eddie George, on September 7.
It expects to see inflationary pressures leading to a quarter or a half
percentage point rise in base rates before the end of the year, and its
forecast assumes a further increase to 6.25 per cent by the middle of next
year.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Worldwide shortage of glass to hit production of TV sets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some 10m potential customers for colour television sets or computer monitors
are likely to be disappointed this year - because of a shortage of the right
kind of glass.
Makers of cathode ray tubes, the funnel-shaped electronic components
responsible for the picture in a television set or computer display, cannot
satisfy demand even though they are working to capacity. They are limited by
the availability of the high quality lead glass used in making the tubes.
Only a handful of companies in the world manufacture the glass. They include
Philips of the Netherlands, Schott of Germany, Videoglass of France and
several Japanese producers, including Nippon Electric Glass and Asahi Glass.
Mr Wim de Kleuver, chief executive of Philips Components, the division of
the Dutch company that makes cathode ray tubes, said world demand for tubes
would be 160m units this year but that CRT makers would be able to produce
only 150m because of the glass shortage.
The reasons for the shortage are twofold:
Glass makers cut investment in the special glass-making plant during the
recession and are finding it hard to increase production to match demand,
currently estimated to be growing by 25 per cent a year.
A number of makers decided to take advantage of the recession for routine
refurbishment and closed about a quarter of the industry's capacity.
Now Philips is planning to spend about Pounds 10m to increase capacity at
its UK glass-making plant near Blackburn in Lancashire, while Schott is
collaborating with Nippon Electric Glass to build a new plant in Cardiff to
supply Sony's Bridgend television factory.
Philips is a major supplier of CRTs to television and computer manufacturers
throughout the world. In the UK its customers include National Panasonic,
Hitachi and Sanyo of Japan and Samsung of South Korea.
In the meantime, CRT makers are seeking new sources of supply. Some are
transporting glass around the world by ship while others are thinking of
recycling old displays. This is regarded with horror by some manu-facturers
because of the greater risk that displays could burst in use.
Industry analysts reckon the surge in demand is unlikely to continue next
year allowing glass makers to catch up.

FT  26 AUG 94 / Lockheed barred from exporting Hercules: Decision raises
doubts over Pounds 1bn tender to supply RAF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lockheed, the US aerospace company, has been barred indefinitely from
exporting its C-130 Hercules aircraft by the US State Department, raising
doubts about the company's Pounds 1bn bid to supply the UK with replacement
transport aircraft.
The company is accused of breaching the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by
bribing foreign officials on previous contracts. Lockheed is attempting to
sell 30 of the latest-generation C-130J aircraft to Britain and 12 similar
transporters to Australia.
The ban, revealed in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission this week, was imposed by the State Department on August 18. It
follows the indictment in June on bribery charges of two Lockheed executives
and the company's Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Company (LASC) subsidiary,
which makes the Hercules transporter and the P-3 Orion maritime patrol
aircraft.
The scandal comes during a battle over the UK transporter order between
Lockheed and a group led by British Aerospace, which wants the Royal Air
Force to buy a European alternative.
Lockheed already has export licences for the UK deal, but the political
sensitivity of the issue would make any conviction embarrassing.
The Ministry of Defence had hoped to make a decision before the end of the
year. The C-130J is due to be in service by 1996.
The company is accused of paying an Egyptian politician, Ms Leila Takla,
Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) to help secure an order for three Hercules
aircraft five years ago. It denies the allegations and is contesting the
court case. The two executives accused are Mr Allen Love, formerly LASC's
director of Middle East and North African sales, and Mr Suleiman Nassar, a
Lockheed regional vice-president who operated from Geneva and is being
sought by investigators.
If convicted, Lockheed faces an indefinite ban on exports from its LASC
subsidiary until it can satisfy the State Department that practices have
been improved. Export licences granted before the June 22 indictment still
stand, and the company can appeal on a case-by-case basis for any ban to be
lifted.
Licences for potential UK and Australian exports should be unaffected by the
court case, according to the company. Even so, any conviction would raise
the political stakes in the UK of deciding to buy a US rather than a
European made transporter.
In a separate report, the US Air Force said that the C-130J would be five
months late and would be Dollars 200m over-budget.
A Lockheed spokesman said the company was happy with its estimates.

Delaney, the direct sales fitted furniture company, consolidated its
recovery in 1993 and reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 232,000 for the
half year to June 30.
The outcome compared with a loss of Pounds 187,000 last time and came from
turnover up from Pounds 7.52m to Pounds 8.97m. Earnings per share emerged at
0.2p (0.2p losses).
No interim dividend is declared, but Court approval for a share capital
reconstruction was granted on July 20, leaving the way open for the company
to distribute profits.

FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: Esselte ahead 30% in spite of
slow sales
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Esselte, the Swedish office products group, yesterday reported a 30 per cent
rise in pre-tax profits in the first half to SKr180m (Dollars 23.7m), up
from SKr138m in the same period last year. This was in spite of only a small
increase in sales.
The group said the profits growth was produced by a reduction in costs of
SKr65m, which more than offset a SKr23m increase in financial expenses to
SKr96m, caused by lower hedging benefits.
Esselte confirmed its forecast that full-year pre-tax profits in 1994 would
exceed last year's SKr301m.
Sales in the first half rose 3 per cent to SKr5.89bn from SKr5.7bn. Although
Nordic and southern European markets showed growth, sales were lower in the
US, the company's biggest country market, and in Germany.
However, a turnround in the US, where the company's operations have been
restructured, was expected in the second half of the year.
The benefits of new products, particularly the new Dymo 1000 electronic
labelling tool, were also expected to show through in the latter stages of
the year.
Divisional results showed the strongest performance for Esselte Dymo, the
mainstream office products division, and Esselte Meto.
Sales at Esselte Dymo increased to SKr2.2bn from SKr2bn, while operating
profits rose to SKr139m from SKr118m.
Sales at Esselte Meto, which makes price marking equipment and other
products for the retail industry, rose slightly to SKr1.49bn from SKr1.45bn,
but operating profits jumped to SKr101m from SKr68m.
Esselte Pendaflex, which handles traditional office supplies to the US,
Canada and Mexico, North America, pushed up sales to SKr964m from SKr933m
and swung to an operating profit of SKr15m from a loss of SKr7m.

'Alitalia's strategy includes the search for solutions including the use of

But Alitalia denied a report in a newspaper that it had presented a plan to

Bang &amp; Olufsen, the Danish television and audio products manufacturer,
reported its best year in the 12 months to May 31. Net profits of DKr90m
(Dollars 14.1m) compared with a loss of DKr60m in the previous year.
Sales increased 13 per cent to DKr2.40bn from DKr2.12bn. The result after
net financial costs of DKr24m was a profit of DKr132m compared with a loss
of DKr38m last year.
The board proposed a DKr10-per-share dividend, the first to be paid for four
years.
Cash flow increased to DKr540m from DKr97m. There was a return on equity
capital of 13 per cent after negative returns in each of the past three
years.
The preliminary statement said the improved performance was in spite of a
generally weak market in audio-visual products.

Bremer Vulkan, Germany's biggest shipbuilding group, yesterday forecast
double-digit profits for the full year, following a DM191m (Dollars 119m)
loss last time.
The Bremen-based company said orders in the first six months had risen 32
per cent over the same period a year earlier, to DM2.9bn, with enough work
to last until mid-1996.
Bremer Vulkan said earlier this year it hoped to restart dividend payments
in 1995.
The group reported a DM3.8m loss for the first six months, compared with a
profit of DM22m in the same period the year before.
The restructuring measures and redundancies begun in the second half of last
year were beginning to take effect, it said.
About 2,600 workers lost their jobs in the first six months and a further
1,300 are due to go before the end of the year, bringing the group's
workforce down to 24,000.
Helped by the first-time consolidation of several new subsidiaries, turnover
jumped 21 per cent in the first six months to DM3.16bn.
Excluding the consolidation of the shipbuilding activities at the east
German dock of Stralsund and other companies in the east German port of
Rostock, turnover rose 2 per cent.
Shipbuilding still makes up about 40 per cent of group turnover but the
company is expanding its electronics, industrial and trading divisions.

<TEXT>
Mazda Motor, the Japanese carmaker, yesterday announced plans to launch a
joint venture with Ford of the US to produce pick-up trucks in Thailand.
Ford holds a 24.5 per cent stake in the Japanese group and this year has
strengthened its representation on the Mazda board.
The companies have started feasibility studies, to be completed next spring,
of the south-east Asian pick-up truck market, after which details of the
venture will be decided. Production is set to start in 1998.
The companies plan to make a pick-up truck based on Mazda's multi-purpose
vehicle. Mazda has a joint venture production line with Japanese and Thai
companies in Bangkok. Mazda said the Ford venture would run separately from
the existing plant, now working at full capacity.
Mazda holds 4 per cent of the Thai pick-up truck market, trailing Japanese
car makers Isuzu, which holds 31 per cent, and Toyota, at 27 per cent. Ford
only has a 0.2 per cent share. Pick-up trucks account for 90 per cent of
Thailand's commercial vehicle market.

The US Transportation Department says 1993 was the busiest year ever for air

cent from 1992, AP reports from Washington.
US airlines carried 54 per cent of that traffic, an increase of 1 percentage
point from 1992, the department said.
It was also a record year for international air freight, totaling nearly
4.7m tons, a 10 per cent increase over the previous year. US airlines
carried 41 per cent of the freight traffic, also a one-point increase over
1992.

FT  25 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Asda active
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turnover in food retailer ASDA Group jumped to a hefty 29.5m, making it the
day's most actively traded stock after a broker reiterated its buy
recommendation on the stock.
The shares closed 3 ahead at 67p, as Morgan Stanley reiterated its buy
stance on the stock and predicted likely profit upgradings. Mr Nick Bubb at
the broker said: 'If the stores renewal programme continues to deliver
results and industry margins continue to recover then current profits
estimates will look conservative.' His current prediction is for full-year
profits of Pounds 200m.
Investment bank Lehman brothers were also said to have been active in the
stock.
The sector has been left behind in recent sessions and dealers took the
opportunity of a strong market yesterday for bargain-hunting, thus boosting
other food retailing stocks. Kwik Save jumped 10 to 612p, Argyll Group 8 to
296p and Tesco, 4 to 249p. Tesco said yesterday it had received acceptances
for 58.11 per cent of Wm Low, the Scottish grocer at the centre of the
recent bid battle, and also claimed acceptances for 49.77 per cent of the
preference share offer.
Securities house UBS was said to have had the big buyer of WH Smith Group,
the high street retailer which reported figures in line with market
expectations yesterday.
The shares gained 12 to 481p, after trade of 2m. However, Mr Tony Shiret at
BZW was decidedly lukewarm about the figures and said: 'The results were in
line but I think the progress of the main WH Smith chain was muted.'
Presentations to institutions by Boots boosted the shares another 11 to
563p.
News that Body Shop is under investigation by US authorities in relation to
its US franchise operations left the shares trailing 8 to 219p.
MFI Furniture rose 3 to 149 1/2 p after BZW, a long term bear of the stock,
moved it from the sell list and gave it a hold recommendation following the
stocks' recent strong underperformance.
Kingfisher put on 6 to 534p, ahead of today's visit by institutions to one
of its warehouses.
Pharmaceuticals groups gained ground as takeover stories circulated in the
market. Wellcome, which is considered to be a prime bid candidate lifted 11
to 720p, with some additional help from the potential benefit from a legal
fracas with SmithKline Beecham, which fell 2 to 446p in the A's. Meanwhile
Zeneca which has also been mentioned as a potential UK target, improved 17
to 848p and Glaxo, considered to be looking for an acquisition, gained 7 1/2
to 652 1/2p.
Shell Transport improved 11 to 729p as SG Warburg discussed the group's
interim dividend prospects. The house was arguing that the company would
boost its UK dividend by 12 per cent to 11.4p and its full year payout by 16
per cent to 27 1/2 p putting the yield at a 15 per cent premium to the
market and giving a 10 per cent upside to the shares. Meanwhile, BP
benefited from news that it had successfully completed tests at its Cupigua
field in Colombia. The shares gained 6 to 412p.
Tobacco and insurance conglomerate BAT Industries improved 10 to 432p as
optimism over the prospects for tobacco profits in the US prompted Salomon
Brothers to upgrade its recommendation on rival Philip Morris. Shares in the
Telegraph sank 14 to 360p after the newspaper group revealed disappointing
first-half figures.
Among property stocks, Land Securities shed 3 to 649p on reports that
Kleinwort Benson had urged investors to switch out of the stock and into
MEPC, a penny harder at 454p. However, Kleinwort Benson denied making such a
recommendation.
Building materials group CAMAS, which was demerged from English China Clays
in June, put on 3 to 85p, following a UBS recommendation. English China shed
3 to 385p.
Information Technology group Parity gained 12 to 129p following a sharp rise
in interim profits to Pounds 2m.
Chemicals group Sutcliffe Speakman fell almost 20 per cent as the company
sacked its managing director and warned of poor sales in its carbons
division. The shares rallied to close 5 off at 40p.
Waste Management put on 6 to 585p ahead of a presentation to US and UK
analysts today.
Talk of an order and recommendation from Hoare Govett boosted defence
electronics group GEC. The shares added 6 to 301p, after trade of 4.7m.
Profit-taking in Senior Engineering which reported a 5 per cent profits
increase, in line with expectations, left the shares 14 1/2 down at 123 1/2
p.
There was poor sentiment among vehicle related stocks after Tuesday's
revelation of figures showing German car registrations down 16 per cent in
July. GKN lost 4 to 624p, while BBA Group eased 3 to 191p. Lucas Industries
relinquished 2 to 191p.

FT  25 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Buy-back pushes RECs up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The regional electricity companies (RECs) saw their share prices spike
higher as Seeboard became the first since the recent regulatory review to
buy back its own equity.
The purchase of 2m shares at 425p in order to distribute part of its cash
surplus to shareholders represented less than one per cent of the company's
equity. It was a fragment of the stake that Seeboard can reclaim - it has
permission to buy back 10 per cent or 25m shares - but served as a timely
reminder of what one analyst described as the 'tiny window of opportunity'
that the RECs have.
Their closed seasons begin at the end of September and when they finally
report they will be inhibited by their involvement with the flotation of the
National Grid. This will take them through to the next closed season and
effectively tie their hands until next summer.
Mr Kevin Lapwood, of Smith New Court said: 'This is a dream ticket until the
end of September.' He believes prices could rise by 15 per cent in the short
term.
Hoare Govett take a more cautious stance but still believes share prices
could rise by a further 7 per cent. Profit taking towards the end of the day
saw some of the more spectacular rises whittled back but Seeboard closed 17
higher at 437p while Southern Electric rose 25 to 792p and Eastern
Electricity, which also experienced very active turnover in traded options,
added 20 at 822p. The gains are likely to dampen down some of the takeover
speculation that has surrounded the sector since Goldman Sachs bought a
block of 7.7m shares, some 2.99 per cent stake in Eastern, the sector
leader.

A burst of heavy buying interest from the US and throughout Europe just
before the close of trading, drove the FT-SE 100 index decisively through
the 3,200 level.
FT-SE 3,200 has proved a stumbling block to the market in recent sessions,
with the index pushing through that level many times only to drop back
sharply.
The buying was mainly through the FT-SE future and was said to have been
generated by strong buying and arbitraging by two leading integrated houses,
one US and the other UK.
At the close the FT-SE 100 was 30.1 higher at 3,205.2, the first time it has
closed above 3,200 since March 22. Buying interest was concentrated in the
market leaders, however, with the FT-SE Mid 250 index, which contains many
of the outperforming utilities stocks, able to record a modest 8.7 rise at
3,762.1.
Some traders attributed the burst of support to the excercising of a
specially constructed FT-SE stock option at the 3,200 level, a move which
led to a rush of short covering and arbitraging in both the future and cash
markets.
Market strategists preferred to ascribe the upturn in the market to a
decoupling of European equity markets from international bonds. It was
noticeable that bonds endured difficult trading for much of yesterday with
German bunds unsettled by evidence of increasing inflation in western
regions of Germany.
Inflation in Baden Wurtenburg rose 0.2 per cent in the month to mid-August,
giving a year-on-year increase of 3.1 per cent while in North Rhine
Westphalia inflation was 0.1 per cent higher on the month and up 2.8 per
cent on the year. Analysts were concerned that evidence of rising inflation
could demolish any hopes of a cut in German interest rates next week when
the Bundesbank Council meets to discuss monetary policy. UK gilts closed
little changed on the session.
The market's last-minute advance built on earlier modest gains in equities.
The 100 index began the session quietly firm, up over seven points,
responding to Wall Street's good overnight performance which in turn was a
reflection of the encouraging outcome of the auction Dollars 17bn worth of
two year bonds.
European markets received a further boost from the US where the Dow Jones
was more than 20 points higher shortly after the opening, following a fall
in US durable goods orders. The US news was interpreted as indicating a
slowing of the US economy and produced a rise in US bonds.
The buying spree produced another useful increase in the volume of business
in London. Turnover reached 701.6m shares, well up on Tuesday's 556.5m and
Monday's 499m. The value of customer business in London on Tuesday was
Pounds 1.3bn.
News that Seeboard had purchased 2m of its own shares late on Tuesday was
the trigger for yet another burst of strength in the regional electricity
stocks which have spiralled upwards both before and following the
electricity distribution pricing review last month.
All the 12 electricity companies have shareholder permission to buy their
own shares and the market is also braced to expect a burst of stakebuilding
and or takeover activity possibly even ahead of the removal of the
Government's 'golden shares' which will be withdrawn next March. It was also
pointed out that several institutions are still underweight in the Recs and
waiting for an expected bout of profit-taking in the sector.
Composite insurers delivered good rises across the board with traders noting
the sector's underperformance for much of the year. And there were keen
buyers in the market for Lloyds Bank and HSBC. Takeover stories remained the
dominant factor in a buoyant drugs sector where Glaxo, Zeneca and Wellcome
all made significant progress.

<TEXT>
Stock index futures raced ahead as the trading session drew to a close,
cruising through the 3,200 level and closing sharply higher writes Steve
Thompson.
The market's buoyancy, which followed another strong performance from Wall
Street, was in sharp contrast to the early part of the session.
The September futures contract opened at 3,198, mirroring the strong showing
by Wall Street overnight and a steady performance by US bonds, but quickly
ran out of steam, slipping back to the day's low point, 3,186.
For most of the day the contract moved narrowly before suddenly rushing up
through 3,200. At that key level it prompted a welter of buying from the
locals, or independent traders, who rushed in to cover short positions.
Dealers also noted heavy arbitraging, selling the future and buying the
underlying stocks.
The contracts ended the day at 3,225, a hefty premium of 22 points over fair
value and an indication that dealers are looking for a strong performance
from the market in the short term. Turnover was a slightly disappointing
12,045 contracts.
Talk that a specially-tailored FT-SE 100 stock option had been struck at
3,200 also helped spur the market on.
Eastern Electricity, topped the list of most active stock options, with
3,458 contracts traded.

FT  25 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Steadiness in bonds, firmer
dollar lift Dow
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
A rally by US stocks carried over into a second session yesterday morning
thanks to a steady bond market and a firmer dollar, writes Frank McGurty in
New York.
By 1pm, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 24.60 higher at 3,800.43 as the
market tested strong technical resistance at the 3,800 level. The more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 1.69 ahead at 466.20.
Volume on the Big Board was relatively light, with only 163m shares
exchanged by early afternoon. Advancing issues led declines by a
five-to-four margin.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was up 0.71 at 446.99,
while the Nasdaq composite added 1.56 to 749.54.
The sustained advance by share prices was somewhat surprising given the
absence of any market-moving fundamental developments. Indeed, the day's
main economic news was unfavourable to those investors looking for evidence
of continued growth in spite of the recent upturn in interest rates.
The Commerce Department announced that factory orders of durable goods last
month slumped 4.2 per cent, raising the eyebrows of most analysts, who had
forecast a slight gain.
But most of the decline stemmed from normal summertime shutdowns of
automobile assembly plants and a big drop in the volatile aircraft sector.
Thus, the significance of the headline figure was generally dismissed.
Still, the data were enough to keep inflation-sensitive bonds in positive
territory during the morning. The dollar, which posted decent gains against
the yen and D-mark after stabilising the previous day, lent additional
support to equities.
Yesterday, investors could not rely on capital-goods issues to carry the
rest of the market forward. The sector grew quiet after a strong outing the
previous session, with the news on durable goods snuffing out any lingering
enthusiasm generated by Deere's robust quarterly performance.
Among the Dow industrials, two other cyclical stocks stepped to the fore.
Alcoa advanced Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 78 1/2 while International Paper
added Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 72 7/8 .
On the negative side, IBM was set back Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 66 7/8 a day
after announcing plan to slash prices on personal computers used by
businesses.
Blockbuster Entertainment was trading down Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 26 3/8
after its board reaffirmed its approval of plans to merge with Viacom. The
news pushed Viacom's 'A' shares Dollars 1 1/4 lower to Dollars 39.
In retailing, Best Buy gained Dollars 2 to Dollars 33 3/8 on a 'strong buy'
recommendation by Alex Brown &amp; Sons.
Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, was marked down Dollars 2 to Dollars 67
1/8 . The firm reported a 46 per cent downturn in second-quarter profit
after Tuesday's close.
On the Nasdaq, Oracle climbed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 40 7/8 after Merrill
Lynch raised its estimate of the company's fiscal 1995 net income.
Amgen gave back Dollars 2 to Dollars 54 after appreciating Tuesday in
anticipation of a imminent takeover in the biotechnology sector. At least
two Wall Street securities houses downgraded the stock on the basis of its
high price.
Canada
Toronto stocks soared in active trading boosted by sharp gains in mining and
banking. The TSE 300 composite index rose 52.05, or 1.24 per cent, to
4,263.73 in volume of 73.69m shares valued at CDollars 1.04bn. In all, 12 of
the 14 stock groups rose. Mining was up 3.64 per cent and banking 2.16 per
cent,golds added 1.71 per cent and consumer products gained 1.47 per cent.
Industrial products and energy stocks posted little change.
American Barrick boosted its takeover offer for Lac Minerals to CDollars 5
plus 0.325 of a Barrick share, or 0.487 of a Barrick share, for each Lac
share held. Lac's board recommended the revised offer. American Barrick fell
CDollars  5/8 to CDollars 29 3/4 and Lac gained CDollars  1/4 to CDollars 14
1/4 . Mexico
Mexican stocks rallied to close up 1.55 per cent on investor confidence
after the presidential elections. The IPC index gained 42.69 to 2,798.22 in
moderate volume.
Venezuela
Caracas closed slightly down with the market struggling to regain the upward
tendency of the last few weeks. The Merinvest composite index closed 1.52 or
1.05 per cent lower at 142.98.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Recent weeks have been dominated by elections in the world's emerging
markets, polling having taken place in both Mexico and Sri Lanka. Investors
are now keeping a close watch on the performance of Brazil, which has
presidential elections in October.
The Sao Paulo stock market has been encouraged this week by new opinion
polls which have suggested that the former economy minister, Mr Fernando
Henrique Cardoso, has extended his lead over the other main candidate, Mr
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
A period of profit-taking is expected in the short term, given the market's
strength in recent sessions. However, over the longer term analysts remain
positive on Brazilian stocks, helped by positive economic signals,
particularly in the form of lower forecasts for inflation data covering
August and September.

FT  25 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong stabilises as
Tokyo turns round
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A break in the yen's appreciation against the dollar supported the futures
market and the Nikkei index gained ground for the first time in four trading
days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
Buying by arbitrageurs and public funds lifted the 225 average by 130.82 to
close at the day's high of 20,511.60. It hit a low of 20,311.96 in the
morning session, but revived on buying by public pension and insurance
funds.
Futures traders were encouraged by the Bank of Japan buying dollars.
Meanwhile cross trading - the selling and buying back of stocks to realise
profits without changing the portfolio - among corporate investors and banks
before the September book closing also lifted activity. Volume totalled
273.6m shares against 192m.
However, other than domestic institutions buying back some steel and
electrical stocks, there was a lack of investment demand.
The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 6.91 to 1,638.70 and the
Nikkei 300 rose 1.35 to 298.35. Gainers led losers by 565 to 423 with 193
unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 1.55 to 1,329.78.
Steel makers were higher with Nippon Steel up Y8 to Y370. Some electronic
makers and high-technology companies, which had been hit by the yen's rise,
picked up. NEC gained Y20 to Y1,180 and Ricoh added Y12 to Y955.
In contrast, Toshiba lost Y7 to Y733 on profit-taking and Hitachi, although
traded actively, remained unchanged at Y978. TDK, the tape maker, sank Y110
to Y4,270 on reports of a fall in quarterly earnings.
Drugs stocks were higher. Takeda Chemical advanced Y10 to Y1,260 and Mochida
Pharmaceutical gained Y110 to Y2,250.
Stocks traded actively on cross-trading included Nikko Securities, which
rose Y10 to Y1,170, Nissan Motor, up Y3 to Y783 and Daiei, which added Y20
to Y1,760.
DDI, the telecom company listed on the second section, gained Y46,000 to
Y960,000 on bargain-hunting.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 30.63 to 22,810.31 in volume of 56m shares.
Ono Pharmaceutical gained Y40 to Y4,880.
Roundup
Hong Kong stabilised after Tuesday's sharp drop while other markets slid
back after profit-taking.
HONG KONG erased early weakness following Tuesday's disappointing land
auction with a late round of bargain-hunting.
The Hang Seng index closed 4.63 higher at 9,238.69 after a morning low of
9,130.07. Turnover was a preliminary HKDollars 3.67bn, up from Tuesday's
adjusted HKDollars 3.17bn.
But brokers said sentiment remained wary before today's interim profit
announcements from Cheung Kong, the property developer, and the
conglomerate, Hutchison.
The H-share index, tracking Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong, rose
13.11 or 1.10 per cent to 1,206.21.
SINGAPORE slipped as participants continued to book profits following recent
gains. The Straits Times Industrial index fell 24.06 to 2,278.82 as 299.7m
shares changed hands.
Malaysian shares traded over the counter were also under pressure, with the
UOB-OTC index shedding 9.28 to 1,248.97.

FT  25 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Selective interest revives
banking sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Interest in the underperforming banking sector, selective in Zurich but more
general in Frankfurt, was a key feature in yesterday's bourse recovery,
writes Our Markets Staff.
Mr Robert Law, a banking analyst at Lehman Brothers in London, said this
week that there were now strong valuation arguments for selected bank
stocks: bank p/e and yield relatives, he said, had returned to 1980s levels
and the fall in bank shares had been almost indiscriminate.
FRANKFURT rose in moderate activity, turnover only easing from DM7bn to
DM6.9bn as the Dax index increased 18.50 to 2,126.37, more than
incorporating Tuesday's post-bourse gains, and climbed again after hours to
an Ibis-indicated 2,132.98.
Investor interest in banks, along with consumer and building stocks, took
Deutsche Bank up DM15.50 to DM701.50, Dresdner by DM10 to DM398.50 and
Bayernhypo by DM7.50 to DM410.
Interest in the chemicals sector was positive, but relatively muted, Hoechst
leading after its 39 per cent rise in first half pre-tax profits with a gain
of DM3.50 to DM347.50. In pharmaceuticals, however, Schering bounced back
strongly after coming under sharp recent pressure on news of an official
probe into some of its drugs, recovering another DM24 to DM912.50 .
PARIS tracked bond futures and ended a little higher, the CAC-40 index
rising 5.66 to 2,006.29 in turnover of FFr3.2bn. Banks mostly did well, Suez
rising FFr3.50 to FFr261 and CCF FFr4 to FFr213.50.
The losers included Canal Plus, down FFr16 to FFr911 after Les Echos, the
newspaper, said that Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, France's new communications
minister, was expected to put stricter conditions on the operations of
France's main coded television channel.
MILAN ended higher, the Comit index rising 12.77 to 688.32, but political
factors continued to influence shares. Investors were waiting for Friday's
cabinet meeting at which draft 1995 budget proposals are due to be
discussed.
As a result, short-term buying was evident in most sectors, although
insurance and telecom stocks proved to be notable exceptions.
Insurers were popular among foreign and domestic institutional investors who
were said to be bargain hunting after the heavy losses suffered by the
sector in the market's recent correction. The sector also benefited from
speculation that it could gain from budget changes. Generali, for example,
was up 1.1 per cent at L41,771 and RAS gained 1.4 per cent at L25,849.
ZURICH drew support from a firmer dollar, with the SMI index advancing 10.2
to 2,541.1. However, volume remained thin and most activity was limited to
position-squaring by professionals.
Investors focused on Georg Fischer, up SFr105, or 7.2 per cent at SFr1,560
after reporting better than expected first half profits. UBS bearers
recovered SFr19 to SFr1,097, while buy orders boosted Nestle SFr10 to
SFr1,194 and Roche certificates by SFr60 to SFr5,740.
AMSTERDAM was supported by a slightly firmer bond market, and by Wall Street
as the AEX index closed 3.21 higher at 414.04.
One of the bright spots was Internatio-Mueller which jumped Fl 6.90 to Fl
86.40 after reporting first half results above expectations, while KPN
closed up Fl 0.20 at Fl 51.80 in fairly heavy turnover ahead of half-year
results released after the close of trade. KPN, the Dutch telecommunications
and postal group partly privatised in June, posted a rise of nearly 17 per
cent in first-half net profit.
In contrast, Pakhoed was down Fl 1.30 at Fl 48.90 after first half results
which were below expectations while Hagemeyer closed down Fl 0.20 at Fl
136.80 on its progress report.
Philips advanced by Fl 0.60 to Fl 57.70 after Moody's Investors Services,
the US credit rating agency, said that it had placed the company's long-term
debt ratings under review for a possible upgrade.
MADRID accelerated its recovery a little on Wall Street's gains and a firmer
dollar, the general index rising 1.91 to 306.15 in turnover of Pta23bn.
Banks were mixed with BBV, Banesto, Popular and Argentaria all losing
ground, BCH gaining a little and Santander rising Pta60, or 1.2 per cent to
Pta5,160. ADR stocks like Repsol and Telefonica offered a gentle response to
Wall Street, rising Pta15 to Pta4,005, and Pta10 to Pta1,795 respectively.
STOCKHOLM finished sharply higher, underpinned by the stronger trend on
other European bourses. The Affarsvarlden General index climbed 25.3, or 1.8
per cent to 1,436.6 on turnover of SKr2.95bn. Astra A jumped SKr5, or 3 per
cent to SKr170 on speculative buying ahead of mid-term results next week.
WARSAW dropped on intense profit-taking in blue chips and brokers said that
the slide would probably continue tomorrow. The all-share index fell 535.8,
or 4.2 per cent, to 11,971.2, weighed down by a 10-per cent decline in the
market heavyweight, Wedel.

Johannesburg registered strong gains in steady trade as it reacted to gold
price strength and firmer world equity markets.
The overall index added 39 at 5,897, industrials were 33 better at 6,650 and
golds rose 39 to 2,284, up 1.7 per cent.
Dealers said that sharply weaker local bonds had very little effect on
equities, in spite of earlier fears that negative sentiment could spill over
into shares.
The new listing, Housewares, rallied to a 300 cent high before settling back
to close 10 cents higher at 290 cents. It was issued at 200 cents on Monday.
Among gold shares, Vaal Reefs added R5 at R419 and Kloof rose R1.50 to

FT  25 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Dollar and pound firmer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar and sterling were yesterday both beneficiaries of rallies which
came at the expense of the D-Mark, writes Philip Gawith.
Both moves were technically driven, rather than a reflection of
fundamentals, and came against the backdrop of low turnover in markets
devoid of any news to respond to.
'The market is looking for things to do, rather than what it really believes
in,' was the comment of one trader.
The only release of note was the July durable goods number in the US, a
figure too volatile to offer much direction to the market.
The dollar closed in London at DM1.5411, from DM1.5377. Against the yen if
finished slightly down at Y98.415 from Y98.45.
Sterling hung on to the coat-tails of the US currency, to close at DM2.3977,
from DM2.3893, and at Dollars 1.5558 from Dollars 1.5539. The sterling index
finished three basis points firmer at 78.9.
The D-Mark was mixed in Europe, finishing slightly higher against the
Swedish krona, but down against the Italian lira.
Mr Nick Parsons, treasury economist at CIBC in London, said there appeared
to be an 'anti D-Mark mood' in the market. Evidence of this was the firmer
dollar, which spilled over into Europe. The Franc, for example, appreciated
steadily throughout the day from FFr3.4320 down to the FFr3.4250 level.
Sterling also threatened to rise above the DM2.40 level.
Mr Parsons said these moves did not reflect new news, but 'a failure of
previous chart targets.' In the case of the dollar, for example, the
currency rallied before it touched the recent low of DM1.5165, reached on
July 12.
He attributed this to a diminished appetite for risk in the market. 'The
pain threshold is a lot lower than it would have been a year ago,' said Mr
Parsons.
He said investors appeared to be running ever tighter stop levels, meaning
that they were quicker to liquidate positions that turned against them. 'If
you don't get instant gratification, you have a reversal of the position.'
Traders said that failure of the dollar to re-test the old low suggested
that the downside for the currency had been established. Yesterday it tried
to capitalise on this and push higher, but without conspicuous success. The
durable goods numbers were insufficiently reliable for any firm conclusions
to be drawn about the economy.
Mr Ian Gunner, international economist at Chase Manhattan in London, said a
pattern appeared to have been established whereby European crosses. pushed
down by a stronger D-Mark, recovered quickly once the dollar stabilised.
'This pattern will stop people aggressively shorting those cross-rates,'
said Mr Gunner.
The recommencement of US-Japan insurance talks was accompanied by some brave
talk out of Tokyo about the yen. A senior Bank of Japan official was quoted
by news agencies saying: 'We believe that it is not difficult to change the
current market sentiment through timely and appropriate action.'
'The BOJ will act tenaciously to stabilise recent speculative currency
movements,' he said. His comments came against a background of market
rumours in Tokyo that the BOJ had broadened the ambit of its market
intervention beyond banks, to operating through brokers too.
The official predicted that the dollar was unlikely to drop below its
post-war low of Y96.60, reached on July 12.
Yesterday evening US negotiators said they were making a 'bit of progress'
in the insurance trade talks, but said they did not expect a quick
resolution.
Activity in the short sterling market was very quiet with the December
contract trading only 12,300 lots to finish unchanged at 93.36.
Mr Peter Osler, economist at brokers GNI, said the market was waiting for
the price expectations component of the CBI's industrial trends survey, to
be released tomorrow. The Bank of England recently signalled it out as an
important policy indicator.
Traders said there had been an upsurge in short sterling options volatility
ahead of the CBI release. 'As people get nervous, so volatility goes up,'
said Mr Osler. Options volatility is much higher than in Germany and France,
reflecting the more stable rate outlook in those countries.
Mr Parsons of CIBC said that following the recent good PPI and RPI numbers,
it was possible that price expectations in the CBI survey would be revised
downwards. This would help sterling interest rate markets.
Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-AMRO, said sterling futures
appeared to be too pessimistic about interest rate prospects. Six month
sterling LIBOR, for example, is project to rise from 6 per cent to 7 1/2 per
cent over the next six months.
Mr Norfield said these projections should be taken 'with a large pinch of
salt'. The current inflation environment does not bear comparison with the
past, he said.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zimbabwe's Dollars 225m
platinum deal signed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS

<DATELINE>
   HARARE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The largest foreign investment in Zimbabwe for a quarter of a century was
given the go-ahead yesterday when the government signed a mining agreement
with BHP Minerals and Delta Gold of Australia to develop the Hartley
platinum project.
The total cost of the project, estimated to contain the largest undeveloped
resources of platinum group metals outside South Africa, will be USDollars
225m. The mine, in which BHP will have a 67 per cent stake and Delta Gold 33
per cent, will employ 2,700 people, including 100 expatriates.
Underground development starts next month with the first ore being mined
late in 1995. This will be stockpiled until processing facilities are
completed late in 1996. At full production in 1997 the mine will process
2.16m tonnes of ore annually, to produce 150,000 troy ounces of platinum
110,000 ounces of palladium, 23,000 ounces of gold and 11,500 ounces of
rhodium. Hartley will also produce about 3,200 tonnes of nickel and 2,300
tonnes of copper. It has ore reserves sufficient for a 20-year mine life
with the potential to double production at a later date.
The mine agreement signed yesterday signals a new regime for major
investment projects worth more than Dollars 100m. Zimbabwe's Minister of
Mines, Mr Edison Zvobgo, said the agreement guaranteed investors security of
tenure and stability of fiscal terms.
Although little was said about the controversial issue of marketing, it
seems the Zimbabweans have agreed to allow BHP to market the platinum-group
metals directly rather than going though the state-owned Minerals Marketing
Corporation of Zimbabwe. Gold will be sold by the Reserve (central) Bank of
Zimbabwe, but the nickel and copper will be handled by the MMCZ. This
concession is an important one and could attract other major investors to
Zimbabwe.
On-site facilities at Hartley will include the mill, a concentrator, smelter
and base metals refinery. The refinery will produce nickel and copper
cathodes while platinum-group metals will be toll-refined in Europe. The
promoters say the mine will be a low-cost producer, with unit costs of about
Dollars 225 an ounce, putting it below South African producers such as
Rusplats and Northam and on a par with Lonrho, but substantially more
expensive than Pprust.
Speaking at yesterday's official signing ceremony with the government, Mr
Peter Vanderspuy of Delta Gold predicted that by the turn of the century a
number of platinum projects producing 600,000 ounces annually would have
been established on the Hartley complex and Zimbabwe would become the
world's second largest platinum producer, after South Africa, accounting for
some 12 per cent of global output.
Mr Vanderspuy predicted also that platinum would earn double the foreign
exchange provided now by the tobacco industry and could generate investment
in downstream activities such as the manufacture of exhaust catalysts for
the motor industry.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Anglo expects to go ahead with
Mali gold mine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Anglo American Corporation of South Africa's two-year search for suitable
gold projects in West Africa has paid off and the group expects to give the
go-ahead in October to a USDollars 210m mine in Mali.
The Sadiola project in the far west of the country, near the border with
Senegal, is likely to come into operation in 1997 and produce between 10 and
12 tonnes of gold a year, according to Mr Neville Keys, project director of
Anglo's new mining business division.
Anglo has been widening its search for African gold as nearly every metre of
prospective land in South Africa has been explored and drilled by domestic
companies unable to move freely abroad because of exchange controls.
Modern exploration techniques have merely proved that the old prospectors
left very little to be discovered.
In West Africa, Anglo is also exploring for gold in Burkina Faso, Guinea and
Senegal, where there has been relatively little mining activity in the past
 -Mali has only one other gold mine, the Syana, operated by BHP of
Australia.
Mr Keys said the Adiola, an open pit mine, would have a life of at least 14
years but he believed there was much more gold to be discovered there.
Final stages of the financial arrangements were being put together but it
was expected that Anglo would have 38 per cent of the project and operate
the mine. The private Canadian company that discovered the deposit, Ima
Gold, would also have 38 per cent, the government of Mali 18 per cent and
the International Finance Corporation, the investment arm of the World Bank,
6 per cent.
There is an interesting difference of opinion about the gold market's
prospects between Mr Clem Sunter, chairman of Anglo's gold and uranium
division, and Mr Jim Buys, the group's senior economic consultant.
While both agree that the present gold price is well supported by physical
demand and cannot be expected to go much lower, Mr Buys suggests the price
is unlikely to rise much in real terms unless there is another burst of
speculative interest of the kind seen last May and June, when the market was
given a boost by the well publicised activities of financiers Sir James
Goldsmith and Mr George Soros.
He believes there will be no surge in world inflation to give gold a lift
because governments are giving top priority to keeping inflation down.
Mr Buys argues that if the gold price stays at about Dollars 380 a troy
ounce in real terms for the next 10 years, South Africa's annual gold
production of about 610 tonnes can be expected to fall by 20 per cent.
Mr Sunter, however, is much more optimistic. He says Anglo's gold division
hopes to see a gradual rise in the gold price to take it to Dollars 450 an
ounce in real terms by the end of the century. He describes this as 'a
realistic wish'. Also, South African gold producers showed great resilience
in 1991 and 1992 when many mines seemed to be facing closure because of low
gold prices but survived by cutting costs. He would not be surprised to see
South Africa's gold output remain stable in the 580 to 600 tonnes a year
range for many years to come.
On the question of the relatively poor stock market ratings of South African
gold companies compared to rivals in North America, Mr Sunter says he
expects that other South African producers will follow the lead recently set
by Gencor, which gave an estimate of its 'life of mine recoverable gold' so
that this could be compared with the reserve figures quoted by North
American groups. Mr Sunter says Anglo will probably give a range of reserve
estimates based on various Rand gold prices.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zinc smelters face feed
shortage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Zinc smelters face major uncertainty in the next 10 years in securing
concentrate feed supplies due to an unprecedented number of mine closures,
according to metals industry analysts Brook Hunt and Associates, reports
Reuters.
In its latest review of the zinc concentrates market, Brook Hunt said that a
squeeze on miners' profits by low metal prices and high treatment charges
had resulted in 17 mines, with a total capacity of about 500,000 tonnes of
zinc in concentrate, closing in 1993. And it forecast the closure before
2005, because of reserve depletion, of another 58 mines with an annual
capacity of some 1.9m tonnes.
The magnitude of the mine closures meant that only 18 out of 54 primary zinc
smelters had adequate feed cover to 2005 from mines now in operation, the
report said.
Brook Hunt suggested that the industry needed an additional 1.3m tonnes a
year of contained zinc from new mine production to meet the feed
requirements of existing smelters in 2005.
It also needed a similar tonnage for the 1.2m tonnes of new smelter capacity
required to satisfy a forecast market demand of more than 6.5m tonnes of
refined zinc. New mine projects, re-activations and expansions might add
2.5m tonnes, Brook Hunt said, but start-up dates would be influenced by
ruling metal prices.
Over-production at western smelters since 1990 was forecast to push total
stocks to 1.8m tonnes by the end of this year, fuelling an extended period
of low zinc prices. That could accelerate mine closures and delay the
start-up of new mine capacity.
Lower mine supplies would also prompt fierce competition in a custom
concentrate market enlarged by additional smelters in Brazil and Thailand
because of the depletion of ores at local mines.
Smelters in Canada, Australia and Mexico would lose feed from existing mines
in the next five years which, directly or indirectly, would reduce
availability to the custom market.

Base metals prices showed signs of shaking off the summer holiday blues at
the London Metal Exchange yesterday. As traders looked forward to a pick-up
in demand with the return of northern hemisphere metal consuming industries
to full operation, all LME contracts made ground, some of them quite
substantially.
Copper, the exchange's flagship contract, led the way, building on Tuesday's
after-hours rally with a further Dollars 26 rise to close at Dollars
2,417.50 a tonne for the three months delivery position.
Traders told the Reuters news agency that copper still had a fair amount of
work to do to break resistance around Dollars 2,430, but with New York
Commodity Exchange (Comex) stocks falling and the forward premiums narrowing
(indicating a tightening of nearby availability) they expected a challenge
to be mounted soon.
Aluminium was also strong, breaking resistance at Dollars 1,508 a tonne for
three months metal and moving on to close at Dollars 1,518.50, up Dollars
28.50 on the day, before adding a few more dollars in after hours trading.
The early rise, prompted by trade buying, was fed by short-covering, traders
told Reuters. And with technical factors, constructive speculative activity
was encouraged, notably from the investment funds whose buying and selling
has been so influential in the metal markets during the past year.
Nickel's advance accelerated meanwhile, the three months position adding
Dollars 85 to reach Dollars 5,912 a tonne by the close and pushing forward
to Dollars 5,935 after hours. Traders noted that the market, already nervous
about the possibility of a strike at Falconbridge of Canada should labour
talks there fail, responded to a forecast by Sumitomo of Japan of a strong
rise in 1994-95 in demand for steel. Stainless steel producers are big users
of nickel.
Lead and zinc were able to join in the fun, aided by prospects of rising
physical demand and, eventually, lower production because of reduced
concentrate supplies. Three months lead rose Dollars 10.50 to Dollars 594 a
tonne, while zinc was up Dollars 18 at Dollars 982.50.
European primary aluminium output fell by between 7 and 8 per cent in May
and June as multilateral production cuts took effect, according to the
European Aluminium Association, reports Reuters from Brussels.
'The present decrease on an annual basis would amount to almost 8 per cent,
which could become even higher in the coming months,' it said in an advance
copy of its quarterly report.
Output totalled 247,917 tonnes in June, down 7.1 per cent from a year-ago,
258,075 tonnes in May, down 7.7 per cent, and 260,095 tonnes in April, down
3.2 per cent.
European primary aluminium output fell 4.1 per cent to 1.56m tonnes during
the first half of 1994, compared with the corresponding period of 1993.
Under a memorandum of understanding in March, the world's leading aluminium
producers agreed to cut output by 1.5m to 2m tonnes a year to help resolve a
global oversupply crisis.
The EAA data covers the 12 European Union countries producers and Turkey.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: London coffee futures lose
early gains as rally boils over - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London COFFEE futures ended broadly unchanged after a volatile afternoon
marked by speculator and trade buying as well as technical selling and some
trade liquidation, dealers said.
The market, which was predicted to open Dollars 57 higher in the November
position following gains amounting to Dollars 250 earlier in the week, was
slightly firmer at midday but during the afternoon it swung from a day's
high of Dollars 3,650 a tonne to a low of Dollars 3,530.
At the close it stood at Dollars 3,573.
The London bullion market GOLD price broke through its previous resistance
area around Dollars 383 a troy ounce in early afternoon business as good
buying from the New York commission houses spilled over into Europe. It
closed at Dollars 384.25 an ounce, up Dollars 2.25.
Dealers were restrained in their enthusiasm, however. 'There's very little
physical interest around on gold at present, so I can't see this rally
lasting,' said one.
SILVER, underpinned by gold's move, broke through resistance to hit a high
of 534 cents an ounce before encountering selling.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Government Bonds: Successful auction encourages Treasuries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury bond prices jumped yesterday afternoon after a successful supply
auction allowed the market to build on its morning gains.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up 15/16 at
100 1/2 , with the yield slipping to 7.457 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was  3/32 better at 100 3/32 , to yield 6.183 per cent.
Bonds forged ahead in the early hours after the Commerce Department
announced that factory orders of durable goods had plunged 4.2 per cent in
July.
Analysts were forecasting a slight increase, so the data came as a pleasant
surprise to traders anxious about any sign of economic acceleration, which
could erode the value of fixed-rate investments.
However, their enthusiasm was short-lived. Closer examination of the report
revealed that the unexpected weakness had stemmed primarily from a massive
drop in aircraft orders and a seasonal shutdown of automotive plants.
Excluding the volatile transportation component, the decline was relatively
tame.
After the market had time to digest the implications of the report, bond
prices receded to just above their opening values, even though a firmer
dollar was providing additional support.
The cautious mood reflected uncertainty over the outcome of the Treasury's
sale of Dollars 11bn in five-year notes later in the day. However, in the
event, the sale drew much better demand from retail accounts than
anticipated, allowing bonds to resume their forward advance in the final
hours of trading.
In the end, however, the day's gains were probably exaggerated by the
sluggish activity that characterises most summertime sessions.
The unexpected fall in US durable goods orders for July caused European
government bond markets to jump, but the rally was short-lived as
profit-taking set in almost immediately.
Analysts said it would have been dangerous for the markets to have read too
much into the fall, given the notorious volatility of this series. 'The
market shot up and then came back,' said Mr Adam Chester, international bond
strategist at Yamaichi. He said the fall in the data did not call for a
reassessment of the Federal Reserve's position on inflation.
The other main economic news of the day was the release of cost-of-living
data for August from two of Germany's most populous states. North
Rhine-Westphalia reported that prices were up 0.1 per cent in August for a
yearly increase of 2.8 per cent. Prices in Baden-Wuerttemberg rose 0.2 per
cent for an annual 3.1 per cent increase.
Although the market is still waiting for data from other states, analysts
said it was more than likely that the national figure would be at least 3
per cent. Even though the yearly rate should fall below 3 per cent later in
the year, it was inevitable that the downward progress on the inflation
front was slowing, now that the economy was picking up steam, they added.
'It is a swift reminder that the interest rate cycle is turning,' said Mr
Kit Juckes, international economist at SG Warburg.
On Liffe, the September bund future ended almost unchanged on the day, down
just 0.02 point at 91.41, well off the day's low of 91.60.
Sterling's recovery against the D-Mark helped to underpin the UK gilts
market, though trading remained thin. On Liffe, the September long gilt
future stood  3/16 point higher at 100 31/32 in late trading.
The recent stream of better-than-expected inflation and wage data has
prompted Kleinwort Benson to cut its 10-year gilt yield projection for
year-end from 9.25 per cent to 8.5 per cent.
'We are looking for gilts to outperform bunds and Treasuries from now until
the end of the year,' said Mr Julian Callow, European economist at Kleinwort
Benson.
He also noted that index-linked yields were now close to their 10-year
average of 3.8 per cent, and probably did not have much further to fall. 'As
a result, we would suggest a switch out of index-linked into conventional
gilts,' he said.

FT  25 AUG 94 / International Bonds: Further delay for Lebanese debut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lebanon's debut eurobond offering is now planned for late September, after
being delayed twice in the last year due to adverse market conditions,
particularly for emerging market borrowers.
The offering, now expected to raise Dollars 150m rather than the Dollars
300m originally planned, will be preceded by a series of investor
presentations. The mandate for the deal has been awarded to Merrill Lynch.
Dealers said there had been no real price talk for the issue, and the
maturity date had yet to be decided.
However, the deal is expected to short-dated, and price talk earlier in the
year suggested that the deal would be in the region of 350 basis points over
the comparable US Treasury yield.
'The message on Lebanon is fairly positive,' said one syndicate manager.
'Things have turned around pretty quickly there, and the economic numbers
are looking good.'
However, Middle Eastern countries do not have a history of borrowing in the
eurobond market, and investors are likely to require extensive briefings on
the economic outlook for the country. Further, some investors will be unable
to participate in the deal because the country has no credit rating.
However, dealers said that Lebanese flight capital held in Switzerland was
likely to be invested in the paper, and such investors would not be
concerned by the lack of a rating.
Elsewhere, dealers are still expecting Japan Highway's Dollars 500m
government-guaranteed 10-year deal to be launched before this weekend.
The market will then brace itself for a slew of Japanese issue from the
likes of Metropolis of Tokyo, the Japan Development Bank and the City of
Kobe.
Yesterday, General Electric Capital Corporation and the Council of Europe
each launched offerings in the eurolira sector totalling L150bn.
The high 11 1/2 per cent coupon on GECC's three-year deal proved attractive
to retail investors, who will hold the bonds until maturity, and so are not
necessarily concerned about interest rate volatility in the Italian market.

FT  25 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Report identifies risks of
OTC regulatory loophole
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the market in equity derivatives grows, problems may arise from the
sector's regulatory framework - or rather, lack thereof.
These risks were highlighted in a recent report on the role of derivatives
in Europe's securities markets, commissioned by the International Securities
Market Association (ISMA).
The report points to a regulatory imbalance between cash and OTC derivatives
markets which has created an arbitrage opportunity allowing market
participants to beat regulatory barriers in the cash markets by moving into
the OTC sector. The report also draws attention to the fact that traders can
use equity derivatives to circumvent restrictions on insider dealing and
foreign shareholdings.
In the past, equity transactions in the cash market were reported to stock
exchange authorities. However, due to the growing activity in OTC equity
derivatives, deals are increasingly reported to banking authorities, the
study explains. This is because a high proportion of large, medium-term OTC
transactions are traded by banks which have the necessary balance sheet
strength, rather than by securities houses.
The data reported to banking authorities tend to be aggregated, and banking
supervisors, whose primary concern is prudential supervision, generally do
not obtain information about individual transactions.
As a result, stock exchange authorities in many countries appear to be in
the dark about OTC derivative trades on the shares they supervise.
'Given that some banks (surveyed) indicated a willingness to trade OTC
derivatives of up to 5 per cent of a company's capitalisation in a single
transaction, we feel this is a significant gap in information flow which
needs to be addressed,' the report's authors state.
The result of the OTC/stock exchange divide is that the absence of reporting
requirements in the OTC market provides an obvious incentive to channel
transactions that might otherwise be handled in the cash market, and caught
by reporting requirements there, into the OTC market, they add.
'While we do not support regulation for regulation's sake, neither do we
feel that regulatory arbitrage is desirable. For this practical reason, we
feel that reporting requirements in the cash equity markets and in the OTC
derivatives markets should be made parallel.'
They add that 'if one market is regulated more tightly than the other, the
effect will simply be to drive transactions into the other market'.
Any shift of business from the cash to the OTC market bears the risk of
reducing cash market transparency for equity investors. Moreover, imposing
tight regulations on the cash markets, in which smaller firms can trade
fairly freely, but leaving the OTC market entirely unregulated 'results in a
regulatory tilt in favour of the large global firms which are able to use
the OTC markets in a manner not available to smaller firms', the report
warns.
These worries are not shared by all market participants. 'OTC deals are
private transactions: I don't think it would be appropriate to regulate
every transaction occurring between two private counterparties - that would
prevent a lot of good financial transactions from occurring,' says one
derivatives specialist at a large international bank.
The report also points to other ways - outside the OTC market - in which
equity derivatives can allow traders to escape the regulators' attention.
Derivatives can be used, for example, to execute insider trades without
dealing in either the share or a direct derivative of the share. According
to the study, this appears to have occurred on at least one occasion through
a technique called 'mirror' trading, where a dealer buys a derivative on an
index or a basket of shares and sells short the components he doesn't want.
If, for example, a dealer has inside information on a particular French
company included in the CAC-40 stock index, he could buy the CAC-40 future
and sell short the 39 other shares in the index, leaving him with a net
exposure to only the target share - the equivalent of having a position in
the underlying shares.
In markets where an index future covers a large number of shares, an
alternative might be to buy a basket warrant covering a limited group of
shares including the target share and run short positions in the remaining
shares.
In both cases, it would be hard for investigators to prove that insider
trading has taken place.
Moreover, if regulators were to search for suspicious trading patterns in a
given equity, this type of trade would not necessarily appear on their
checklists.

FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: Georg Fischer back in black at
SFr31m

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Georg Fischer, the foundries and engineering group, returned to the black in
the first half with a SFr31m (Dollars 23.4m) consolidated net income
compared with a SFr33m loss in the same period last year.
The directors attributed the swing to the elimination of loss making
activities and 'the friendlier economic environment in Europe'. They
forecast a profit of more than SFr50m for the full year.
'The turnround was achieved', Mr Ulrich Bremi, chairman, said in a letter to
shareholders.
The group, which is heavily dependent on sales of components to the motor
industry, slumped to a nominal SFr11m profit in 1992 and then into a SFr34m
loss last year. It closed down or sold several lossmaking businesses and
improved productivity of core operations. Value added per employee was 16
per cent higher in the first half of 1994 than the same period of 1993.
Sales in the first half were up 2 per cent to SFr1.1bn, but billings rose 9
per cent to SFr1.06bn. Fischer said the increase was 14 per cent in local
currencies. New orders were up 8 per cent to SFr1.1bn.
The automotive products division, with billings up 2 per cent to SFr364m,
improved its earnings. The piping systems division also recorded a higher
profit on a modest 2 per cent rise in billings to SFr280m.

FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: BHP acts on Beswick shareholding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Broken Hill Proprietary, Australia's largest company, yesterday moved to
quell unease among some of its institutional shareholders over the group's
share structure.
It said the 18.2 per cent stake in BHP held by Beswick, a company in which
BHP owns a half-share, would in future be voted by an independent trustee.
The Beswick board, however, would still be able to decide whether the
tranche of shares should be voted at all.
The complex Beswick situation dates back to the late 1980s, when BHP was the
subject of takeover efforts by Mr John Elliott and the late Robert Holmes a
Court.
Peace was finally declared in 1988, and it was agreed that Beswick would
house the stake which Mr Elliott had acquired in BHP. Beswick, in turn,
would be owned jointly by Mr Elliott's Elders IXL (which later became
Foster's Brewing) and BHP.
It was obvious in 1988 that the circularity of the structure might mean that
BHP was able to influence the voting of the Beswick shares - a potentially
undesirable situation.
ANZ Executors &amp; Trustee Company was therefore given a tiny share stake in
Beswick. Many shareholders, voting on the arrangement in 1988, assumed that
the trustee held responsibility for voting the entire Beswick holding in
'the best interests of BHP as a whole in a manner which promotes or enhances
the continued long-term development of BHP as a significant independent
Australian and international company'.
However, over the past six years, the Beswick board - which is made up of
one representative from BHP, one from Foster's and three independents - has
tended to vote the stake, or simply given its proxy to BHP's chairman, and
the trustee's role has been minimal.
The new procedures, which were announced yesterday, state that the decision
of how the Beswick shares are voted will be left to ANZ Executors unless the
Beswick board resolves that the stock should not be voted at all.

FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: Blockbuster clears merger with
Viacom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The board of US video retailer Blockbuster Entertainment has approved the
merger of the company with Viacom, the entertainments group.
The decision ends months of uncertainty over the planned Dollars 8.4bn
union, which was conceived in January as part of Viacom's Dollars 10bn
takeover of Paramount Communications.
At the time, the structure of the stock-swap deal would have given
Blockbuster stockholders Dollars 31.50 a share.
However, a subsequent sharp drop in the value of Viacom stock - which was
plagued by concerns about how the group would pay off the more than Dollars
9bn in debt that it took on to acquire Paramount - drastically cut the value
of the deal for Blockbuster stockholders.
Instead of Dollars 31.50 a share, at one point they were faced with
accepting only Dollars 21.75 a share, and it was not long before Mr Wayne
Huizenga, Blockbuster chairman, and other leading stockholders began to have
second thoughts.
By May the deal looked dead, but a gradual recovery in Viacom's share price
over the summer (buoyed partly by the impressive performance of
Paramount-produced films at the box office) breathed new life into the
merger, and late on Tuesday Blockbuster's board approved the transaction.
The company's stockholders will now receive about Dollars 29 for each share.

FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: Pioneer advances to ADollars
152m for year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pioneer, the Australian-based building materials and petroleum refining
group, yesterday announced a ADollars 152.3m (USDollars 111.90m) profit
after tax and abnormal items for the year to the end of on sales of ADollars
5.62bn.
The figure contrasts with ADollars 136.6m in the previous year, when sales
were ADollars 5.24bn, but comparisons are muddied by abnormal items and
asset sales.
The company took a ADollars 99.8m charge in the latest year to cover asset
write-downs and rationalisation costs which followed a group-wide review of
the company's position.
This was partly offset by profits from the sale of two significant assets,
leaving the net abnormal charge at ADollars 37.9m. In the previous year
there was an abnormal surplus of ADollars 11.4m.
Pioneer said that operating profit, before interest charges, improved to
ADollars 371.1m from ADollars 312m.
The upturn came entirely from the building materials interests, which span
Europe, the US and Asia, as well as Australia.
These made an operating profit of ADollars 272.3m, compared with ADollars
149.2m last time.
Pioneer said that product volumes had increased slightly, and market
conditions improved in most areas.
It added that the increase was driven by increased efficiencies.
On the petroleum refining and marketing side, it reported a fall in
operating profits from ADollars 194.1m to ADollars 143.8m.
This was due to retail discounting and weak refining margins.
However Mr John Schubert, who took over as managing director last year, said
that he expected some improvement on both fronts this year, as economic
conditions continued to improve and refining margins edged higher.
Earnings per share after abnormals were 17.3 cents, up from 15.7 cents.

FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: Goodwyn gas site insurance
settled
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Woodside Petroleum, the Australian oil and gas company, announced yesterday
that the partners in Western Australia's North West Shelf gas project had
settled an insurance claim for repairs to the foundation piles for ADollars
280m (USDollars 205m). This is ADollars 40m below the actual remedial
expenses, put at ADollars 320m, before allowing for the cost of delays.
The problem arose two years ago when piles being driven into the seabed
underneath the Goodwyn gas and condensate production platform buckled. The
insurance money returned, and the remaining costs, will be shared equally
between the six partners, Woodside, BHP, BP, Chevron, Japan Australia LNG
(MIMI), and Shell.

<TEXT>
Caltex Australia, which is part of the Texas-based Caltex group although
quoted separately on the Australian Stock Exchange, announced a 44.3 per
cent fall in first-half profits, to end-June.
After-tax profits were ADollars 19.8m, (USDollars 14.5m), on sales of
ADollars 1.66bn, compared with ADollars 35.5m on revenues of ADollars 1.71bn
a year ago.
The most recent six-month figure was reached after a Dollars 10.5m abnormal
item. There were no abnormal charges in the previous year, but the figures
benefited from a ADollars 6.37m tax adjustment gain. Earnings per share were
10.98 cents, compared with 19.71 cents previously.
Caltex, which operates more than 1,000 service stations, said that the
abnormal charge related to redundancy costs at its Kurnell refineries, which
would be recovered in two years.
It added that competition in the Australian retail petrol market had
intensified 'dramatically' in the first quarter of the year, and that market
growth in 1994 had been 'basically flat' for petrol, with diesel fuels
expanding 3 per cent.

FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: BHP acts on Beswick shareholding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Broken Hill Proprietary, Australia's largest company, yesterday moved to
quell unease among some of its institutional shareholders over the group's
share structure.
It said that the 18.2 per cent stake in BHP which is held by Beswick, a
company in which BHP owns a half-share, would in future be voted by an
independent trustee.
The Beswick board, however, would still be able to decide whether the
tranche of shares should be voted at all.
The complex Beswick situation dates back to the late 1980s, when BHP was the
subject of takeover efforts by Mr John Elliott and the late Robert Holmes a
Court.
Peace was finally declared in 1988, and it was agreed that Beswick would
house the stake which Mr Elliott had acquired in BHP. Beswick, in turn,
would be owned jointly by Mr Elliott's Elders IXL (which later became
Foster's Brewing) and BHP.
It was obvious in 1988 that the circularity of the structure might mean that
BHP was able to influence the voting of the Beswick shares - a potentially
undesirable situation.
ANZ Executors &amp; Trustee Company was therefore given a tiny share stake in
Beswick. Many shareholders, voting on the arrangement in 1988, assumed that
the trustee held responsibility for voting the entire Beswick holding in
'the best interests of BHP as a whole in a manner which promotes or enhances
the continued long-term development of BHP as a significant independent
Australian and international company'.
However, over the past six years, the Beswick board - which is made up of
one representative from BHP, one from Foster's and three independents - has
tended to vote the stake, or simply given its proxy to BHP's chairman, and
the trustee's role has been minimal.
This situation has prompted persistent shareholder complaints.
Earlier this year, for example, the Australian Shareholders' Association
called for the holding either to be converted to non-voting status or for
the trustee's role to be enforced.
The new procedures, which were announced yesterday, state that the decision
of how the Beswick shares are voted will be left to ANZ Executors unless the
Beswick board resolves that the stock should not be voted at all.
In each specific case, Beswick directors will seek a written statement from
the trustee setting out its voting intention, and this will be announced to
the stock exchange.
Some shareholders have also questioned if the entire Beswick structure -
adopted to prevent two major blocks of shares hitting the market at the same
time - could be dismantled and the shares distributed.
However, BHP has said that this would incur a large tax liability.

<TEXT>
South Korea's finance ministry will ban companies from issuing convertible
bonds and other securities in foreign capital markets in the fourth quarter
of this year.
The ministry said the decision was meant to prevent inflationary pressure
caused by an inflow of foreign capital, with the government worried that
inflation will exceed this year's target of 6 per cent. It added that its
ceiling of Dollars 1.25bn on overseas bond issues for 1994 had already been
reached.
South Korean companies have been eager to tap foreign capital markets to
finance an expansion in industrial facilities being taken in response to an
export boom.
At least 21 companies have applied to the Korea Securities Dealers'
Association to issue overseas bonds during the fourth quarter.
They were hoping to take advantage of improved financial conditions
resulting from a possible solution to the North Korean nuclear dispute.
The ministry had initially proposed to exempt Pohang Iron and Steel (Posco)
from the ban on bond issues. But it decided to impose the restrictions after
protests from other companies.
Posco planned to issue Dollars 200m in American Depositary Receipts this
year as a step to seeking a listing on the New York Stock Exchange, the
first for a South Korean company.

Fairfax

<TEXT>
John Fairfax, the Australian newspaper publisher in which three media
magnates - Mr Kerry Packer, Mr Rupert Murdoch and Mr Conrad Black - hold
stakes, nearly doubled its profits in the year to the end of June, to
ADollars 110.7m (USDollars 81.4m), it revealed yesterday.
The figure, which is reached after tax but before abnormal items, compares
with ADollars 67.1m in the previous year.
Revenues rose by 9.8 per cent to ADollars 845.8m, and earnings per share (on
a fully-diluted basis) totalled 13.99 cents, against 9.01 cents previously.
Below the line, Fairfax also enjoyed a ADollars 75.2m abnormal tax benefit,
taking attributable profits to ADollars 185.7m, up from ADollars 67.2m a
year earlier.
The group is raising its final dividend to 5 cents a share from 4.5 cents,
making a total for the year of 7.5 cents.
Fairfax, which publishes the Sydney Morning Herald, Melbourne Age and
Financial Review, said that it had seen increased advertising volumes and
revenues, although it also attributed the improvement to productivity and
efficiency gains.
Classified advertising volumes were up by 9.7 per cent at the Herald and
10.9 per cent at the Age, while display ad volumes rose by 10.6 and 3.8 per
cent respectively. Advertising volumes at the Financial Review were
'steady'.
Operating costs increased by 6.8 per cent, but the company said that this
was mainly due to promotional activities, new operations and higher
newsprint costs. With these items excluded, it said that the rise would have
been 3.6 per cent. Fairfax also benefited from lower interest charges, down
from ADollars 54m to ADollars 37m.
The company added that it was 'pleased with the results to date in the 1995
trading year'. The company has been the focus of much speculation recently,
because of its potentially unstable share register.
Canadian Mr Conrad Black holds almost 25 per cent of the shares, but is
barred from going higher under Australia's restriction of foreign ownership
of print media assets. Mr Packer has just under 15 per cent, but is also
pegged at this level because of media cross-ownership rules. Mr Murdoch
appeared on the share register in June and is thought to hold around 2 per
cent of the shares.
Mr Tony O'Reilly's Australian Provincial Newspapers, a regional newspaper
publisher operating mainly in Queensland and New South Wales, yesterday
reported profits after tax and abnormals of ADollars 8.11m in the half-year
to end - June, an increase of 25.3 per cent over the same period of the
previous year. Sales rose by one-third to ADollars 89.7m.

NRMA, Australia's largest motorists' organisation and one of its biggest
general insurers, yesterday forecast that it would make after-tax profits of
ADollars 215m (USDollars 158m) in the year to end-June 1995.
This would represent a sharp turnround from the ADollars 129m scored in the
year just ended, although realised losses of ADollars 128m in 1993-94 were
abnormally high and depressed the result. In 1992-93 and 1991-92, NRMA's net
profits were ADollars 248m and ADollars 261m respectively.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Novell, the leading computer networking software company, reported a loss
for its third fiscal quarter after charges stemming from the June
acquisition of WordPerfect and Borland International's spreadsheet product
line, Quattro Pro.
The company announced plans to reduce its workforce by 1,750 through
attrition and redundancies over the next six months, bringing total
employment down to about 8,250.
Revenue for the quarter was Dollars 489m, up 13 per cent from Dollars 434m
in the same period last year. The results for both this year and last
include those of WordPerfect, a software company bought by Novell in June.
The company reported a third-quarter net loss after charges of Dollars 4m,
or 1 cent a share, compared with a net loss after charges for an earlier
acquisition of Dollars 257m, or 69 cents, in the same period last year.
Third-quarter costs from the WordPerfect merger and the purchase of the
Quattro Pro business resulted in charges against earnings of Dollars 120m,
of which Dollars 114m related to the write-off of purchased research and
development associated with Quattro Pro. These costs, net of tax, reduced
earnings a share by 22 cents.
Excluding acquisition-related charges, earnings increased 35 per cent to
Dollars 77m, or 21 cents, in 1994, over a comparable figure of Dollars 57m,
or 15 cents, in 1993.
Wall Street analysts had been projecting earnings of about 25 cents a share.
Earlier this week the company warned earnings would be down because revenue
from its two June acquisitions was lower than expected, while operating
expenses were higher.
Novell said it would complete the process of consolidating its operations
and those of WordPerfect over the next six months and take a restructuring
charge in the fourth quarter.
Combined net revenue for the nine-month period was Dollars 1.5bn, up 14 per
cent from Dollars 1.3bn for the same period in 1993. Net income, including
acquisition-related items in both years, was Dollars 186m, or 51 cents a
share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 62m, or 17 cents.

Disney revamps film unit

<TEXT>
Walt Disney said yesterday that Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg is to step down as
chairman of its film entertainment unit, Walt Disney Pictures, when his
contract expires at the end of next month.
The group also announced that the film unit is to be restructured. It will
be split into two separate entities: one for television and
telecommunications, which will be run by Mr Richard Frank, currently
president of Disney Studios, and one for movie production and distribution,
to be run by Mr Joe Roth, chairman of the group's Caravan Pictures
affiliate.
The departure of the 43-year old Mr Katzenberg is a blow to Disney.
Under his tenure, Disney has been one of the most successful studios in
Hollywood. This year, the animated film The Lion King was a huge hit in the
US and internationally, and is poised to become one of the most successful
films of all time.
Mr Katzenberg's decision to leave Disney is believed to be related to the
failure of Mr Michael Eisner, the group's chairman, to appoint a successor
to Mr Frank Wells, the former Disney president who was killed in a
helicopter accident in April.
Mr Katzenberg's achievements in his nearly 10 years as head of Disney's
studios had appeared to make the 43-year old executive a natural heir to Mr
Wells' position.
When Mr Eisner declined to appoint a new president, it was widely seen as a
rejection of Mr Katzenberg as a potential future Disney chairman.
At the time, Mr Katzenberg was reported to have told friends that he would
leave the group if he was not made president.
The question of management succession at Disney has been a talking point in
Hollywood since Mr Wells' death. It became even more urgent last month when
Mr Eisner underwent emergency heart bypass surgery.
Although doctors predicted a full recovery for Mr Eisner at the time, his
illness, and the lack of a number two at Disney, cast a cloud over the
group's long-term prospects.

<TEXT>
Mercedes-Benz, the German maker of luxury and executive cars, is to buy
engines from Volkswagen for use in a future passenger vehicle.
It will be the first time that Mercedes-Benz will have fitted another
manufacturer's engines in one of its mainstream passenger vehicles.
The deal marks the second significant collaboration this year between two of
Europe's biggest vehicle makers. In April VW agreed to license technology
from Mercedes-Benz for a new range of light commercial vehicles.
Mercedes-Benz said yesterday that it is to purchase VW's VR6 engines and
automatic gearboxes for use in its planned range of multi-purpose vehicles,
which are expected to be launched in early 1996.
The new vehicle, the Viano, will take Mercedes-Benz into one of the fastest
growing segments of the European car market, where it will compete with
established rivals such as the Renault Espace and new vehicles that are
being launched by Peugeot, Fiat, Ford and VW itself.
Mercedes-Benz said that engine and gearbox purchases from VW were expected
to total around DM50m (Dollars 31.8m) a year.
The Viano will be produced at the Mercedes-Benz plant at Vitoria, Spain.

Mr Ralph Lauren, designer of clothes which have come to symbolise a
clean-cut, well-bred way of American life, has sold 28 per cent of his
company to Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, for Dollars 135m.
It is the first time the designer and his business partner, Mr Peter Strom,
have turned to outside capital to fund expansion. Mr Lauren is expected to
take some cash out of the transaction.
New York-based Polo Ralph Lauren, Mr Lauren's company, earns revenues of
about Dollars 3.9bn a year from men's leisure clothes, shirts and ties, as
well as from licensing fragrances, furniture and interior decoration under
Ralph Lauren labels.
Goldman, which has advised Polo Ralph Lauren for six years, describes the
stake as a 'passive' investment.
It holds the shares in its affiliate GS Capital Partners, a Dollars 1bn
investment fund started in 1992, owned 30 per cent by Goldman and 70 per
cent by its clients.
Goldman's investment leaves Mr Lauren with 65 per cent of the company, down
from 90 per cent, and Mr Strom with 7 per cent, down from 10 per cent.

<TEXT>
The two-year feud for management control of family-owned McCain Foods, the
international frozen foods group, has flared up again.
Mr Wallace McCain, 64, co-chief executive with his brother Harrison, 66, has
proposed ending their dispute over succession by taking the company public
and bringing in an outsider to lead it.
But McCain Foods' chairman, Mr Andrew McCain, said the board would come up
with its own proposal for the succession on September 13. It opposes the
plan to go public.
McCain Foods has CDollars 3bn (USDollars 2.1bn) in annual sales and is
highly profitable. The proceeds of a public issue would be used to expand
the business internationally and enable a dividend to be paid, Mr Wallace
McCain said.
The company is 100 per cent controlled by several generations of the McCain
family.
Four outside directors would be appointed, while the board would include the
two brothers and the new chief executive.
Last April a New Brunswick judge arbitrated the dispute between the brothers
and suggested ways to resolve it, including going public and appointing an
outsider as chief executive.
Mr Wallace and Mr Harrison McCain support different members of the family to
succeed them.

<TEXT>
Two of Sweden's leading engineering groups, Sandvik and Atlas Copco,
yesterday announced better-than-expected first-half figures on the back of a
sharp upturn in volumes.
Both companies highlighted better demand from the automotive sector but
noted continuing weakness in the mining and construction sectors.
Buoyed by an improving economic climate in Europe, they forecast full-year
earnings 'significantly better' than in 1993.
Sandvik saw its result jump 53 per cent to SKr1.48bn (Dollars 194m) while
Atlas Copco, the Wallenberg-sphere industrial components group, lifted
profits by 29 per cent to SKr852m.
Sandvik said currencies accounted for just three percentage points of a 12
per cent rise in sales to SKr11.99bn. The group's order intake was 18 per
cent higher at SKr13.4bn.
All four divisions posted improved results. Higher volumes and good
productivity lifted cemented carbide division profits by 50 per cent to
SKr962m. The steel division, where profits rose to SKr376m from SKr231m,
benefited from higher capacity utilisation.
The group said strong demand from the automotive and engineering industries
contrasted with a difficult market for sales to the mining, construction,
chemical and energy sectors.
Atlas Copco said it was at last seeing an extensive investment programme pay
off due to rising volumes and better utilisation rates. But while there was
a clear improvement in its compressor and industrial technique divisions,
profits fell within the compressor and mining business.
A combination of higher volumes, currency effects, acquisitions and price
increases helped lift invoiced sales by 12 per cent to SKr10bn, while the
order intake expanded by 14 per cent to SKr10.7bn. The volume increase was
greater for orders than for sales, the group said, noting a clear break with
the trend which took volumes down by 25 per cent between 1990 and 1993.
Industrial technique benefited from a turnround in the automobile industry,
with profits rising to SKr203m from SKr138m. Profits in compressor technique
were also higher, advancing to SKr646m from SKr466m, helped by a SKr700m
investment programme at an Antwerp plant.
But compressor and mining technique profits dropped from SKr86m to SKr62m
after being depressed by a drop in volumes and restructuring costs.

<TEXT>
NRMA, Australia's largest motorists' organisation and one of its biggest
general insurers, yesterday forecast that it would make after-tax profits of
ADollars 215m (USDollars 158m) in the year to end-June 1995.
This would represent a sharp turnround from the ADollars 129m scored in the
year just ended, although realised losses of ADollars 128m in 1993-94 were
abnormally high and depressed the result. In 1992-93 and 1991-92, NRMA's net
profits were ADollars 248m and ADollars 261m respectively.
The NRMA made the forecast in its flotation prospectus. The group's board
approved a plan to 'demutualise' the company earlier this month.

FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: Mercedes-Benz to buy VW engines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercedes-Benz, the German maker of luxury and executive cars, is to buy
engines from Volkswagen for use in a future passenger vehicle.
It is the first time that Mercedes-Benz will have fitted another
manufacturer's engines in one of its mainstream passenger vehicles, and is
an important sign of its new readiness to develop alliances with other
vehicle producers.
The deal marks the second significant collaboration this year between two of
Europe's biggest vehicle makers. In April VW agreed to license technology
from Mercedes-Benz for the development of a new range of light commercial
vehicles.
Mercedes-Benz said yesterday that it is to purchase VW's VR6 engines and
automatic gearboxes for use in its planned range of multi-purpose vehicles
(MPVs), which are expected to be launched in early 1996.
The new vehicle, to be named the Viano, will take Mercedes-Benz for the
first time into one of the fastest growing segments of the European car
market.
The Viano will compete with established rivals such as the Renault Espace
and new vehicles that are being launched by Peugeot, Fiat, Ford and VW
itself.
Mercedes-Benz said that engine and gearbox purchases from VW were expected
to total around DM50m (Dollars 31.8m) a year.
The Viano will be produced at the Mercedes-Benz plant at Vitoria, Spain,
with a capacity of up to 25,000 units a year.
Under the licensing deal announced earlier this year VW is to use
Mercedes-Benz technology to develop a successor for its ageing LT range of
heavy vans.
Mercedes-Benz will also supply VW with components for the van, including
steering gear, transmissions and axles worth around DM250m a year.
Both deals represent part of the important consolidation taking place in the
European vehicle industry, as makers seek to cut costs and reduce
development times for new products.

<TEXT>
Sandvik said yesterday it had acquired more than 50 per cent of the shares
in Russia's largest cemented carbide company, Moskovskij Kombinat Tverdih
Splavov (MKTS), writes Christopher Brown-Humes.
The move, which builds on a 20-year co-operation between the two companies,
is designed to boost Sandvik in an important market, said Mr Clas Ake
Hedstrom, chief executive.
He said: 'Russian industry, as well as industry in the other countries of
central and eastern Europe, is on the verge of a comprehensive modernisation
of metal-cutting machining.' The group intends to increase its ownership
stake further.
Moscow-based MKTS has 1,200 employees and annual sales of SKr200m (Dollars
26.33m) spread throughout the Commonwealth of Independent States. It
manufactures and markets cemented carbide for machining tools, rock-drilling
tips and wear parts.

<TEXT>
Mr Ralph Lauren, designer of clothes which have come to symbolise a
clean-cut, well-bred way of American life, has sold 28 per cent of his
company to Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, for Dollars 135m.
It is the first time that the designer and his business partner, Mr Peter
Strom, have turned to outside capital to fund expansion. Mr Lauren is also
expected to take some cash out of the transaction.
New York-based Polo Ralph Lauren, Mr Lauren's company, earns revenues of
some Dollars 3.9bn a year from men's leisure clothes, shirts and ties, as
well as from licensing fragrances, furniture and interior decoration under
Ralph Lauren labels.
Goldman, which has advised Polo Ralph Lauren for six years, describes the
stake as a 'passive' and 'long-term' investment.
It holds the shares in its affiliate GS Capital Partners, a Dollars 1bn
investment fund started in 1992, owned 30 per cent by Goldman and 70 per
cent by its clients.
Goldman's investment leaves Mr Lauren with 65 per cent of the company, down
from 90 per cent, and Mr Strom with 7 per cent, down from 10 per cent.
Mr Lauren, who is 54, and Mr Strom, who is 65, have said that they will
continue to participate actively in running the company.

FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: Hoechst upbeat after 39% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hoechst, the German chemicals group, yesterday reported a 39 per cent jump
in first-half profits and predicted a sharp increase for the full year in
spite of continued heavy restructuring costs.
Pre-tax earnings in the second quarter soared almost 70 per cent to DM579m
(Dollars 362m), bringing the total for the first six months to DM1bn.
The group said product prices were still too low although raw material costs
were rising. It noted that restructuring costs in the half were unchanged
from last year while rising sales volume had lifted turnover by 7.8 per cent
to DM24.7bn.
The consolidation of the AgrEvo plant protection company, formed in the
merger of Schering's operations into those of Hoechst, accounted for 3 per
cent of the sales rise, while currency factors contributed a further 1 per
cent.
The results, published in an interim report, added further weight to claims
that the international economic recovery is spreading and taking hold in
Germany. While BASF, which last week reported a 41 per cent earnings rise,
saw domestic sales fall 2.3 per cent, Hoechst reported a slight increase in
German turnover.
Sales at Hoechst Celanese, the north American subsidiary, rose 7 per cent to
Dollars 3.6bn, helped by a recovery in chemicals prices. Latin America
turnover climbed 16 per cent, due in part to contracts undertaken by the
Uhde chemical plant construction subsidiary.
Asian sales increased 25 per cent, with two-thirds of the gain coming from
first-time consolidations and currency effects.

FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: Lac accepts CDollars 2.4bn bid
from American Barrick

<TEXT>
American Barrick has beaten rival Royal Oak Mines to win Lac Minerals,
another large Canadian gold producer, with a revised bid valued at about
CDollars 2.4bn (USDollars 1.73bn).
The move will make Barrick one of the world's biggest gold producers. It is
already one of North America's top three gold producers.
Barrick's new offer, accepted by the Lac board yesterday, is CDollars 5 cash
and 0.325 shares of Barrick for each Lac common share. Alternatively,
Barrick is offering 0.487 shares of Barrick.
Mr Peter Steen, Lac president, said the Lac board had examined several
options and 'found the revised Barrick offer fair and the best available at
this time'. It recommended the offer and agreed to help Barrick gather in
all the Lac shares. He estimated the value at CDollars 15 a share, based on
Tuesday's market price of Barrick shares.
This was at least CDollars 1 a share higher than a rival cash and share
offer from Royal Oak Mines, a medium-sized gold producer based in Vancouver.
Earlier, Royal Oak had extended its bid to September 6, saying it had
received a 'strong response' by the previous expiry date of midnight,
Tuesday.
'This is a friendly transaction with Lac,' said Mr Peter Munk, chairman of
American Barrick and controlling stockholder. 'The combination is an
excellent strategic fit of both companies.'
Mr Munk said Lac would benefit from Barrick's financial strengths and
management experience. 'Shareholder values will be significantly enhanced
for the holders of both companies. We are creating one of the largest and
most profitable gold producers in the world with exceptional growth
potential.'
The Barrick bid expires September 6 and the formal offer will be mailed to
Lac shareholders this Friday.
About half Lac's 148m shares are held in the US, and many US institutions
had been awaiting the higher bid from Barrick.
Though Lac said it had talked to several suitors, analysts do not expect any
last minute counter-bid. Minorco and Echo Bay Mines had been rumoured
contenders for Lac.
Mr Munk said Barrick did not need outside financing to complete the Lac
deal.

FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: Digital sells its 7.9% interest
in Olivetti
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Digital Equipment, the US computer company struggling to cut costs, has sold
nearly 100m Olivetti shares, acquired for Dollars 287.8m in 1992 as part of
an ambitious plan to strengthen links with the Italian computer group.
The 7.9 per cent stake was gradually sold during the slack holiday period.
At yesterday's closing Olivetti share price, it would be worth about L230bn
(Dollars 147.43m), although the US group yesterday declined to reveal how
much it received for the sale of its stake.
However, Digital said that it wrote down in the fourth quarter of fiscal
year 1994 more than half of the intangible assets, valued at Dollars 204m,
included in the Olivetti stake.
Digital said that the sale did not mark the end of product and technological
co-operation. The US company stressed that it would continue to be an
important client of Olivetti for components, terminals and PCs, and a
partner in markets where Olivetti is present.
However, industry sources pointed out that the divestment, part of an
extensive programme of sell-offs by the US company, had weakened the
two-year-old accord, originally heralded as a bold move to buy access to
Europe's largest personal computer group.
Recession and management problems at Digital have undermined those
ambitions. The US group announced an extensive programme of restructuring
earlier this year, involving the sale of assets and the loss of 20,000 jobs.
Olivetti put a brave face on the news, pointing out that the sale of a large
block of shares had been 'easily absorbed by the market, and in particular
institutional investors', with no marked effect on the share price. It added
that some 75 per cent of its capital was now owned by small shareholders and
institutional investors, of which 50 per cent are foreign.
Digital announced its plan for closer co-operation with Olivetti in June
1992, buying some 4 per cent of the Italian company immediately and
indicating that it would increase its holding to as much as 10 per cent over
two years.
The US group accelerated its investment programme last year, lifting its
holding to 8.21 per cent by May this year, which made Digital the largest
Olivetti shareholder after Cir, one of the holding companies of Mr Carlo De
Benedetti, the Italian company's chairman. The stake has since been diluted
by capital increases and the conversion of bonds into shares.

<TEXT>
Koninklijke PTT Nederland, the Dutch telecommunications and postal group
which was partly privatised in June, posted a rise of nearly 17 per cent in
first-half net profit, exceeding analysts' expectations.
The company predicted a large increase in full-year profit, based on the
results for the first six months.
First-half net profit increased to Fl 1.02bn (Dollars 583m) from Fl 873m a
year earlier, on turnover up 7.1 per cent at Fl 9.09bn. Analysts' forecasts
had called for net earnings of between Fl 925m and Fl 995m.
KPN said volume sales achieved by PTT Post, its postal arm, had exceeded
expectations, reflecting increases in both domestic and international mail.
Operating profit rose by slightly more than 25 per cent to Fl 263m.
The postal subsidiary, which is active in third-party mail handling in other
parts of the world, is seen as a possible model for other countries
contemplating the privatisation of their postal authorities.
PTT Telecom, the group's telecommunications subsidiary and its largest
single business, posted a 9.4 per cent increase in turnover and a 4.8 per
cent rise in operating profit to Fl 1.51bn.
KPN's interim dividend has been fixed at Fl 0.80, in line with a forecast
published in the share prospectus in June.
The government's sale of a 30 per cent stake in KPN raised nearly Fl 7bn,
making it the biggest bourse flotation in Dutch history. It is due to be
followed by a second tranche of shares by the end of 1997.
The first-half figures were released after the close of bourse trading in
Amsterdam, where KPN's shares closed at a new high of Fl 51.80. They had
been floated at Fl 49.75, with private investors receiving a discount of Fl
2.50 on the first 75 shares.

FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: Nordbanken surges in first half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nordbanken, the worst casualty of Sweden's 1992 banking crisis, yesterday
reported the biggest profit of any of the country's banks in the first half
of this year.
It was lifted by the acquisition last December of Gota Bank, the other chief
victim of the loan-loss shock.
Nordbanken, bailed out by the government two years ago but now set for
privatisation, announced an operating profit in the first six months of
SKr2.46bn (Dollars 315.3m), ahead of the SKr2.3bn achieved by Svenska
Handelsbanken, the only bank which survived the crisis without seeking state
aid. It said it expected profits in the second half to be about the same,
implying a full-year profit of close to SKr5bn.
As was the case for Handelsbanken and Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken,
Nordbanken's rising profits were largely attributed to a big fall in loan
losses. Nordbanken's credit losses tumbled to SKr1.09bn in the first half,
of which SKr167m was accounted for by Gota Bank. Nordbanken's loan losses
were SKr2.78bn in the first half of 1993.
Nordbanken did not show comparative consolidated figures including Gota Bank
for 1993.
The result will strengthen the case for the privatisation of Nordbanken,
supported by the governing right-centre coalition and the opposition Social
Democratic Party. The bank is hoping for a decision after next month's
general election.
Privatisation will help the state recoup some of the large sums it paid out
to keep the banking system afloat. The lion's share of the support - worth
about SKr80bn - went to Nordbanken and Gota Bank in an operation which
included hiving off SKr110bn of their bad loans to separate bad banks, which
will remain under state management until fully unwound.
The extent of the clean-up at Nordbanken and Gota Bank provoked protests
from its rivals that Nordbanken had gained unfair competitive advantage. It
is now the country's biggest bank by market share with about 25 per cent of
the overall domestic market.
Nordbanken said that its non-performing loans still totalled SKr15bn - down
from SKr15.9bn at the beginning of the year - and it made provisions for
loan losses of SKr9.2bn.
The bank warned that a recent rise in interest rates could extend the period
of high loan losses.
Nordbanken was badly hit by a fall in earnings from trading on its bond
portfolio, which slashed profits before loan losses.
Excluding Gota Bank, Nordbanken's operating profit was up only slightly at
SKr1.97bn, compared with SKr1.74bn in the same period last year.
It was slowed by falling lending volumes and narrower margins which left net
interest income, excluding Gota Bank, at SKr4.38bn, compared with SKr4.36bn
in the first half of 1993.
Net interest income including Gota Bank was SKr5.54bn.

The management of Lac Minerals was last night poised to accept a revised
offer by American Barrick valuing the Canadian gold producer at CDollars
2.4bn (Dollars 1.73bn).
Barrick, one of North America's top three gold producers, has now beaten
rival Royal Oak Mines for the hand of Lac Minerals and will become one of
the world's biggest gold producers.
It raised both the cash and share-exchange terms of its original offer.
The new offer is CDollars 5 cash and 0.325 shares of Barrick for each Lac
common share. Alternatively Lac shareholders can take 0.487 shares of
Barrick.
About half Lac's 148m shares are held in the US, and many US institutions
had been awaiting the higher bid from Barrick.
'This is a friendly transaction with Lac,' said Mr Peter Munk, chairman of
American Barrick resources and controlling stockholder.
'The combination is an excellent strategic fit of both companies.'
Barrick said that Lac's management will recommend the new offer and
co-operate in bringing in all the Lac stock.
Mr Munk said Lac will benefit from Barrick's financial strengths and
management experience. 'Shareholder values will be significantly enhanced
for the holders of both companies.
'We are creating one of the largest and most profitable gold producers in
the world with exceptional growth potential.'
Barrick's new offer expires on September 6. The new offer will be mailed to
Lac shareholders by this Friday.
Earlier Royal Oak Mines, a Vancouver-based medium-sized gold producer
extended its bid to September 6, saying it had received a 'strong response'

It refused to disclose the percentage of acceptance that it had achieved.

FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: BMW paid Honda Pounds 200m for
Rover stake

<TEXT>
BMW, the German executive and luxury carmaker, has paid Honda Pounds 200m
(Dollars 310m) for the Japanese carmaker's 20 per cent stake in Rover,
bringing the total cost of its takeover earlier this year of the leading UK
car producer to Pounds 1bn.
Details of the financial transactions between BMW and Honda were revealed
for the first time yesterday with the publication of the Japanese carmaker's
first-quarter results.
It was also disclosed that Honda paid BMW Pounds 74m to buy back the 20 per
cent stake that Rover previously owned in Honda of the UK Manufacturing, the
Japanese carmaker's UK assembly plant in Swindon.
According to the Honda figures, the net cost to BMW of unravelling the
cross-shareholdings between Rover and Honda totalled Pounds 126m.
The one-off gains from the Rover transactions helped to more than double
Honda pre-tax profits in the first quarter (April to June) of its 1994-95
financial year to Y32.2bn (Dollars 327m) from Y15.3bn a year earlier
including a Y14.6bn gain from the Rover deal.
Net profit almost quadrupled to Y23.1bn from Y6.1bn, including a Y12.8bn
gain from the sale of the Rover hold-ing.
Honda's operating profit for the quarter increased by 15.8 per cent to
Y25.8bn from Y22.3bn a year earlier. Cost-cutting efforts saved Honda
Y19.5bn, but the yen's strength against the dollar reduced operating income
by Y26.5bn.
Honda turnover for the three months to the end of June rose by 5.8 per cent
to Y973.1bn from Y919.6bn in the corresponding period a year ago.
The group's results were supported by a strong performance in the US, where
its car sales volume (the Honda and Acura brands) has risen by 15.1 per cent
in the first seven months this year.

FT  25 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Out of the laboratory into the boardroom -
Alan Cane on a company which is making a profit from the manufacture of DNA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Making the complex biochemical that carries the genetic code is a profitable
if prosaic business these days. Oswel, a commercial company based at, but
separate from, Edinburgh University, has the process of manufacturing
strands of DNA, the material of heredity, down to a fine art.
Customers are typically forensic science departments, teaching hospitals or
biological laboratories. Orders are keyed into the company's computer
network and, at the press of a button, one of Oswel's seven DNA synthesisers
springs into life, conjuring up exactly what the customer ordered. The
invisible strands of DNA in phials of water are packed in padded envelopes
and sent out by ordinary mail.
What are the strands of genetic material used for? Biologists use them for
experiments on the mechanism of inheritance; forensic scientists use them to
identify tissues found at the scene of crimes. A method called the
polymerase chain reaction uses Oswel's strands to turn tiny amounts of DNA
into quantities large enough to analyse with ease.
The synthesis machines, costing Pounds 40,000 a time, run all day and
sometimes through the night.
Professor Tom Brown, co-owner of Oswel with his wife Dorcas, emphasises the
chemical rather than biological nature of the synthetic process. Oswel is,
he says, a supplier of high quality, specialist chemicals, which happen to
be fragments of the stuff of life.
Oswel (Oligonucleotide Service, Wellcome Trust), was established in 1986
with a Pounds 96,000 grant from the Wellcome Trust and Pounds 2,000 from the
university. Prof Brown, with a broad background in the chemistry of the
genetic code, was appointed director; he now holds a personal chair in
chemistry at Edinburgh.
The aim was to offer a service to the university's world-renowned biological
sciences departments, providing oligonucleotides - gene fragments. Word of
the quality of Oswel's products got around, however, and soon the unit was
receiving orders from outside.
It was also intended to be self-financing. It advertises its services in
scientific journals such as Nature and by direct mail and, since Prof Brown
knows who is doing what in gene research, he is able to approach potential
customers directly.
By 1992, it was clear that the unit would develop more effectively free from
university bureaucracy, and Prof Brown and his wife bought the unit from the
university.
The deal, one of the first management buy-outs from any UK university, was
arranged with the aid of UnivEd Technologies, the university's commercial
arm.
It cost Pounds 500,000, representing about Pounds 100,000 worth of equipment
and Pounds 400,000 of goodwill, and in a gesture which Prof Brown describes
as 'enlightened', the university agreed the Browns could pay for the company
out of profits.
Oswel has annual revenues of about Pounds 1m, representing some 20,000
orders, and is sufficiently profitable for Prof Brown to predict that they
will have paid off the debt within three years.
Oswel reckons it is the largest DNA synthesis unit in the UK. DNA machines
can be bought off the shelf, but it requires skill and experience to run
them efficiently. Many organisations these days prefer to order their
fragments from commercial 'gene factories' such as Oswel.
The chief competition is large US companies such as Genosys. Oswel has the
advantage of a local presence and a reputation for quality products  - a
reputation it guards jealously. The DNA strands are monitored and analysed
continuously during manufacturing, and a sample of each is stored in the
laboratory's deep freeze in case of complaints.
The chief threat to the business would be price-cutting by the US houses; at
Pounds 70 to Pounds 80 a sample, Oswel charges premium prices. Prof Brown
argues, however, that quality is his customer's foremost consideration.
Furthermore, a company which cut its prices would find it difficult to
invest enough to sustain research and development.
Oswel grew 35 per cent last year, and Prof Brown believes it should be able
to sustain growth of 20 per cent a year for the foreseeable future.
It has signed a distribution deal with the UK arm of the Applied Biosciences
division of Perkin Elmer, the US company which supplies it with equipment
and chemicals.
The next step is to move beyond the synthesis of DNA to DNA sequencing -
determining the order of the chemical groups in DNA strands. Once the
leading edge of gene research, this is increasingly yielding to automation.
Prof Brown looks set to reap the reward for the hard work he and his wife
have put in over the past few years. The university, meanwhile, has seen its
Pounds 2,000 investment turn into Pounds 500,000 in a decade and will
continue to receive royalties on Oswel products.

FT  25 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Senior Engineering edges ahead to Pounds
12.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Senior Engineering Group yesterday fell 14 1/2 p to 123 1/2 p
after the tubular products, ducting and thermal engineering company reported
sluggish first half profits.
Although turnover grew from Pounds 182m to Pounds 196m, disappointing
performances by the construction services and thermal engineering divisions
contributed to flat pre-tax profits of Pounds 12.1m (Pounds 11.4m) in the
six months to June 30.
Profits were also dented by a Pounds 634,000 loss on the disposal of two
non-core subsidiaries - Senior Engineering (Pty) and Senior Phoenix RFS -
which were sold for Pounds 1.75m earlier this year.
Analysts, who had expected profits closer to Pounds 14m, said the falling
share price reflected 'some shock' at the figures.
Mr John Bell, chief executive, admitted some parts of the business had
suffered from falling sales, but expressed surprise at the market reaction.
'I'm really quite amazed. Orders have been weak in our thermal and
construction businesses, but that has been more than offset by the success
of the engineered products division.'
Rising sales at Flexonics, the group's flexible tubes business, fuelled a 74
per cent increase in operating profits to Pounds 8.16m (Pounds 4.68m) in the
engineered products division.
That performance was enhanced by a three month contribution from Metal
Bellows and Berghofer, the two connector companies acquired for Pounds 18.6m
earlier this year.
Mr Bell underlined the importance of the division, which accounted for 62
per cent of the group's Pounds 13.2m (Pounds 11.9m) operating profits, by
outlining plans to invest up to Pounds 28m in Flexonics over the next two
years.
He also warned that it would continue to outperform the thermal engineering
and construction services divisions, which both lost sales.
Profits in thermal engineering fell 23 per cent from Pounds 3.7m to Pounds
2.84m as orders faltered in both Britain and North America. Construction
services - dominated by air distribution systems - suffered from a shortage
of larger contracts and saw profits drop to Pounds 2.26m (Pounds 3.32m).
Earnings per share were unchanged at 3.24p and the group declared an
increased interim dividend of 1.3p (1.26p).
COMMENT
Senior's share price finally ran out of steam yesterday as 5.5m shares were
traded. The short, sharp, shock dealt by the market may have been a bit
harsh given the strength of its engineered products and the cyclical nature
of the downturn in the other divisions. But if it persuades the management
to use its Pounds 15.8m cash reserves to pursue new markets for thermal
engineering and construction, rather than devote most of it to Flexonics,
then it could serve as a useful warning. Full year profits are likely to
exceed Pounds 28m, but on a forward multiple of 16.5 the shares look good
value only as a long-term investment.

FT  25 AUG 94 / UK Company News: S Daniels Pounds 244,000 in the red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
S Daniels, a supplier to the food manufacturing and baking industries,
reported a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 244,000 for the first half to June 30,
which it attributed to 'unprecedented competitive pressure' and
rationalisation costs.
The company had forecast a loss for the period at its annual meeting in May.
The previous first half saw a pre-tax profit of Pounds 25,000.
Sales expanded by 15 per cent to Pounds 19.1m (Pounds 16.7m), but the group
said all divisions had experienced intense pressure on margins, particularly
the bakery ingredients business of Kluman &amp; Balter.
In addition, start-up costs were carried in connection to a new depot and
relocation of the beverage packing facility.
An exceptional item of Pounds 46,000 reflected the rationalisation of the
head office and the raw materials division, which was expected to benefit
the second half.
Losses per share were 3p, against earnings of 0.3p.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sutcliffe Speakman is parting company with its chief executive in the wake
of a disappointing performance in its UK carbons activities, writes Katrina
Lowe.
Mr Richard Mumford assumed the post of managing director and chief executive
at the time of Sutcliffe's reconstruction in 1991. It is thought that there
was a difference with the board over management style and his handling of
the group's carbons business, where demand has been slack.
Mr Mumford was a specialist in the activated carbon business. The company is
engaged in activated carbon technology and environmental protection systems.
Mr Ernest Tyerman, chairman, said yesterday that the downturn in carbons
sales partly reflected reduced bulk sales in the short-term.
He added that estimates that the problems could result in an overall profits
shortfall in 1994-95 in the region of Pounds 200,000 were not incorrect at
present, but there was some time to go until the year end.
In the year to end-March Sutcliffe swung a Pounds 6.56m loss to profits of
Pounds 1.1m pre-tax.
The shares fell 7p yesterday to 40p.

FT  25 AUG 94 / UK Company News: FT-SE 100 fall cuts funds at Gartmore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gartmore, the UK-based fund management company 75 per cent owned by Banque
Indosuez, yesterday reported a Pounds 1bn drop in funds under management to
Pounds 20bn in the first half of the year because of falls in bond and
equity markets.
It declared its first post-flotation dividend of 1.75p, payable from
earnings per share of 5.7p (3.5p). Profit before tax for the six months rose
by 55 per cent to Pounds 17.5m, with revenue rising by 39 per cent to Pounds
41.8m.
Gartmore attracted net new funds under management of Pounds 1.4bn, of which
Pounds 600m came from pension funds. However, funds fell by Pounds 1bn - or
5 per cent - from the end of last year after a 15 per cent decline in the
FT-SE 100 Index in the period.
Mr Paul Myners, chairman, said he remained confident that Gartmore had the
expertise and ambition to achieve progress and grow its profits at a
satisfactory rate over the long term 'subject to the impact of movements in
markets'.
The rate of growth in net new funds was slower than last year, when Gartmore
attracted Pounds 4.2bn in funds. Mr Andrew Brown, finance director, said the
company had warned then that such an 'exceptional' growth rate was
unsustainable.
The interim dividend cost Pounds 3.53m of attributable profit of Pounds
11.4m (Pounds 7m). Mr Brown said that this level of cover was not a guide to
dividend policy, and Gartmore expected to maintain dividend cover of about
two times in the long-term.
Its funds came mainly from UK pensions, with Pounds 15.3bn from that source
compared with Pounds 16.4bn at the end of 1993. Some Pounds 1.5bn was from
unit trusts and offshore funds, Pounds 1bn from investment trusts, and
Pounds 2.05bn from overseas clients.
Mr Brown said that there had been strong growth in unit trusts and offshore
business. He said that, having started by establishing a strong UK business,
overseas fund management was becoming 'a very interesting market for us'.
Mr Philip Gibbs, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said he estimated
that funds under management had now risen to Pounds 22bn, and that
management fees were likely to improve in the second half. The shares closed
6p down at 173p.
COMMENT
Gartmore was bound to slow down after its growth of last year, and the fall
in markets made the halt abrupt. Business still appears strong, despite a 32
per cent rise in expenses from taking on staff. Revenue should grow in the
second half, but it must fight to keep the momentum in the longer term. With
earnings per share of 12p expected for the year, the shares are trading on a
multiple of 14.5 - not expensive for a company with a healthy, if short,
record of growth.

FT  25 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Medway behind 78% leap at Mersey Docks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mersey Docks and Harbour, the UK's second-largest port group, yesterday
announced a 79 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds
8.86m to Pounds 15.9m, reflecting the impact of the recently-acquired Medway
Ports.
Profits from the Port of Liverpool continued to surge in the six months to
June 30, recording a 17 per cent advance, while Medway contributed close to
Pounds 6m.
Medway, acquired for Pounds 103.7m last September, has been beset by
difficulties. Three of Medway's directors resigned, and it has lost both the
Olau Line's ferry service and the import/export contract for Toyota cars.
However, Mr Trevor Furlong, managing director, said the management vacuum
had been satisfactorily filled and Medway's profits were in line with
forecasts at the time of its acquisition.
Overall, Mersey achieved a 37 per cent increase in turnover, from Pounds
44.8m to Pounds 61.5m.
The Port of Liverpool suffered from a decline in throughput in coal and
scrap steel, but achieved total throughput of 13.6m tonnes, marginally
higher than in 1993.
The company won new business from ABC Container lines and Canada
Maritime/OOCL, which it said would more than offset losses from two other
customers.
In the Medway, car throughput at Sheerness remained high, with 177,000 units
handled in the first half of the year. Toyota is estimated to account for
about 40,000 units a year, and Mr Furlong was confident that a replacement
contract could be won.
The loss of Olau has been partly replaced by Mersey itself, which is
chartering two ships to provide its own service to the Netherlands. This
service is currently being expanded.
The company invested Pounds 9.3m in the first half in new cranes and
warehousing, and will spend about Pounds 20m for the full year, including
substantial new storage space in Birkenhead.
Net borrowings totalled Pounds 24.5m, amounting to gearing of 15.5 per cent.
The interim dividend is lifted from 2.85p to 3.3p, a rise of 16 per cent.
Earnings per share increased by 31 per cent from 8.98p to 11.72p.
COMMENT
Mersey Docks is into its fifth year of double digit profits, and has
demonstrated that teething problems at Medway have not hurt its growth trend
 -operating profit margins from its port business were 31 per cent. With a
high proportion of fixed costs, any new business will feed through rapidly
into profits, and although competition among the ports remains intense,
Mersey has demonstrated its ability to win new custom. Analysts expect
pre-tax profits of Pounds 24m for the year, putting the shares on a p/e of
18. Current growth trends and the management track record fully justify this
premium.

FT  25 AUG 94 / UK Company News: US consortium ups Learmonth Burchett stake
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Learmonth &amp; Burchett Management Systems, the USM-quoted computer services
company, is acting to ensure that a greater proportion of its capital is
held by US investors.
Mr Roger Learmonth and Mr Rainer Burchett are selling shares and, with their
families and related trusts, granting options to a US consortium led by
Bessemer Venture Partners III which will increase its holding to 19.4 per
cent.
The consortium is being offered 975,000 shares at 85p and options on a
further 1.03m at the same price. The deal will leave Mr Burchett with a
holding of 16.6 per cent and Mr Learmonth with 11.3 per cent. The shares
were unchanged yesterday at 94p.
The move follows a rights issue, underwritten by the consortium, which left
it with a 10.2 per cent stake. 'This was considerably less than they had
hoped for,' said L&amp;B, which wants to increase its US shareholders as it
moves its focus across the Atlantic.

FT  25 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Invesco at Pounds 18.7m as margins improve
 -Better European outcome offsets fall in North America following increase
in costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Invesco, the international fund management group, yesterday reported flat
interim pre-tax profits as an improved European contribution offset a
decline in North America.
Mr Charles Brady, chairman, said the group felt it could afford to raise the
interim dividend by 25 per cent to 1.25p because it had strengthened its
balance sheet and increased its profit margins.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to the end of June were Pounds 18.7m,
against Pounds 23m which included exceptional profits of Pounds 4.04m.
However, Mr Brady pointed out they were a significant improvement on last
year's second half figure.
Earnings per share were 5.3p (5.4p).
He said it was a satisfactory performance given market conditions during the
first-half. Funds under management slipped from Pounds 43bn to Pounds 42bn.
In North America a rise in income to Pounds 62m (Pounds 56.7m) was more than
offset by an increase in costs to Pounds 41.8m (Pounds 35.1m). The resulting
pre-tax profit was Pounds 20.7m (Pounds 22.1m)
Mr Brady said this reflected significant investment in administrative
arrangements for defined contribution retirement plans for individual
employees. This was a expanding area of business, but one in which the
profits would not show through until next year.
The results also showed Invesco's continuing rationalisation of its European
operations. Income fell to Pounds 22.6m (Pounds 23m) but costs fell more
sharply from Pounds 21.9m to Pounds 19.8m to give a pre-tax profit of Pounds
3.93m (Pounds 3.7m).
Mr Norman Riddell, chief executive Europe, said he expected staffing of the
European operation to fall further to fewer than 400 by the end of 1995,
against 500 at the start of last year.
He said that retail business in the UK had been recovering earlier than he
had expected, and that business in France and eastern Europe had also been
growing. The difficult area remained UK pension fund business.
In the Pacific operation, income rose to Pounds 4.93m (Pounds 4.29m) but
costs rose more steeply to Pounds 5.4m (Pounds 4.47m) as the region was
formally set up and management strengthened.
COMMENT
Depending on which measurement you take, Invesco looks on the expensive side
of the sector, or a bit undervalued. On a prospective p/e of 15.5 to 16, it
is above the sector average. Yet Invesco is among the cheapest stocks
measured by market value as a percentage of funds under management.
Invesco's performance will continue to depend critically on market
conditions and its ability to wring more profits from its funds under
management. There are some encouraging signs in the European cost-cutting
and in the profits which should come through from the US personal pensions
business. Invesco's recovery phase is not yet over, but the results seem
reassuring rather than the reverse.

Emap, the media concern, has sold Radio City to Radio City 1994, a holding
company owned equally by Emap and Schroders, its merchant bank.
The move ensures that Emap complies with industry regulations following its
acquisition of Trans World Communications, the Preston-based local radio
group. The Pounds 71m deal raised the number of radio licenses held by Emap
from three to eight - two more than permitted.
Consequently Emap and Schroders set up the holding company to allow two of
the licences to be 'warehoused'. Radio City operates two local radio
services - City FM and Radio City Gold in Merseyside.
Consideration for Radio City was Pounds 15m of unguaranteed interest bearing
loan stock, to be retained by Emap.

FT  25 AUG 94 / UK Company News: CSS helps Parity rise to Pounds 2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Parity, formerly Comac, the information technology staff agency and services
group headed by Mr Philip Swinstead, improved pre-tax profits substantially
in the first six months, in line with the company's predictions.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 60,000 to Pounds 2.02m, while turnover
expanded to Pounds 38m (Pounds 5.3m). The interim dividend is restored at
0.75p.
The improvements reflected the contribution of CSS Trident, the contract
staff agency acquired last year. The combined group is the UK's largest
supplier of contract IT professionals in the UK.
Since June the group has strengthened its consultancy side with the
acquisition of the UK consultancy business of LBMS and the CLASS training
company.
Earnings per share were almost doubled at 3.54p (1.8p). The company has net
cash balances of Pounds 4.8m (Pounds 700,000).
Yesterday the shares rose 12p to 129p. Analysts upgraded their estimates for
pre-tax profit for the full year to Pounds 4m.
Mr Swinstead said payment of an interim dividend, omitted last year,
reflected confidence in second-half trading.
Mr Billy Carbutt, chairman, said the group was trading well in the second
half of the year: 'The IT agency industry is restructuring and agencies are
achieving good penetration of the quality end of the IT staff resourcing
market, previously the domain of the established software houses.'

FT  25 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Rapid growth for Mayflower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mayflower, the specialist automotive engineering group, increased its
pre-tax profits by 48 per cent from Pounds 2.37m to Pounds 3.51m in the
first half.
Group turnover rose by 36 per cent to Pounds 65.6m (Pounds 48.2m).
Mayflower has grown rapidly since 1991 following the acquisition of Motor
Panels and last year of International Automotive Design (IAD).
It is raising its interim dividend to 0.5p per share from 0.45p a year ago.
Its share price fell yesterday by 1p to close at 62p per share.
Sales volumes increased in most of the group's product lines and will be
helped by the launch earlier this year of the Rover 400 Tourer estate car
and the High Cube Ford Transit van for which Mayflower provides body parts
from its Motor Panels operations in Coventry and Wigan respectively.
Sales in the second half will also be supported by the start of production
of the Aston Martin DB7 luxury sports car for which Mayflower is supplying
the welded bodies.
Motor Panels sales in the US in the first six months rose by 32 per cent to
Pounds 24.4m from Pounds 18.5m in the same period a year ago helped by the
strong growth in the US heavy truck market.
Motor Panels at Coventry increased sales in the first half by 38 per cent to
Pounds 20.1m.
The IAD businesses achieved a turnover of Pounds 16m in the first half with
an underlying growth of more than 20 per cent. Mayflower has invested Pounds
16m to date in a 'major engineering programme'.

FT  25 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Low oil prices reduce Monument to Pounds
3.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Low oil prices hit Monument Oil &amp; Gas, the independent explorer, which
yesterday announced a 36 per cent fall in interim net profits from Pounds
5.3m to Pounds 3.4m.
Mr Tony Craven Walker, chief executive, said a 19 per cent fall in average
oil prices to Pounds 10.17 a barrel was the main factor behind the 30 per
cent drop in gross profits to Pounds 4.2m. Oil prices were also blamed for
the 18 per cent fall in turnover to Pounds 14.1m for the six months to the
end of June.
On the brighter side, Mr Craven Walker said the costs of developing
Monument's 20 per cent interest in Liverpool Bay were running about 10 per
cent below budget. This meant that the group was currently funding its
obligations from cash resources. Liverpool Bay is expected to come on stream
by December 1995.
The declining profits masked a substantial contribution from asset
disposals. A net Pounds 50.5m was raised from the sale of lossmaking North
Sea assets to BP and the disposal of 3.9 per cent of Liverpool Bay.
Under full-cost accounting, these gains are offset against the carrying cost
of reserves in the balance sheet. As a result, Monument's depletion charge
fell by 99p in the first half to Pounds 2.81 per barrel, largely due to the
disposals and to a contract to sell gas in Argentina.
Mr Craven Walker said the lower depletion charge would benefit the group
substantially when production began to take off next year. Production in the
first half fell from 7,900 barrels of oil equivalent to 7,700 boe per day.
Second-half production would also be lower, due to asset disposals.
Monument drilled seven wells in the first half, none of which was
successful. Farm-outs had kept the drilling costs at Pounds 3m, Mr Craven
Walker said. The group aimed to drill 17 wells in the second half, mostly
overseas.
As in previous years, there is no dividend. Earnings per share fell to 0.51p
(0.8p).
COMMENT
Monument has set itself up nicely for a low oil price environment. Most of
the high cost, low return assets have been sold, swapped or farmed out,
leaving it with a strong balance sheet and exposure to interesting areas
overseas. The big question is what to do now? Mr Craven Walker has long
espoused the principle of crystallising value for shareholders. So far, this
has been through a solid share price performance. Yet investors facing a
quiet 18 months and no dividend will be asking for something more, and
Monument could well deliver within the next year. The sale of a tranche of
Liverpool Bay could be a taster of what is to come. Forecasts are for net
profits of roughly Pounds 7m. At last night's price of 70 1/2 p, the shares
appear to be up with events, at least until the future direction becomes
clearer.

FT  25 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Marley ahead sharply to Pounds 26m -
Improved efficiency and housebuilding recovery fuel advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of a first dividend increase for three years was offered
yesterday to shareholders of Marley, the building materials group, which
announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 26m for the six months to the end of
June - its best first half performance since 1989.
This compared with pre-tax profits of Pounds 13.2m during the first half of
1993.
The latest figures were inflated by a profit of Pounds 6.5m from the sale
for Pounds 19.7m of Bisch Marley, the French clay tile producer.
Earnings per share before disposals rose from 3p to 4.5p. The group said it
would be paying a maintained interim dividend of 2.1p.
Sir George Russell, chairman, added: 'With higher profits now being achieved
some increase in the final dividend for the year will be considered.'
In spite of this, Marley's share price slipped 4p to 151p reflecting
profit-taking and market concerns about rising polyvinyl chloride prices and
slower growth in German building materials profits.
Prices of pvc - used for plastic building components - rose by about 15 per
cent in the period, said Mr David Trapnell, chief executive.
First half profits had been boosted by a combination of improved efficiency
and increased UK and US housebuilding, which had benefited sales and prices
of bricks in the US and thermalite blocks in the UK. Concrete and clay
operating profits more than trebled to Pounds 6.1m (Pounds 1.8m).
Profits from plastic plumbing, moulding and flooring products, employed
later in the development cycle as buildings approached completion, remained
little changed at Pounds 14.2m (Pounds 14m).
Mr Trapnell, echoing comments made yesterday by WH Smith, said it was
'surprising, puzzling and disappointing' that sales for repair, maintenance
and DIY work had remained very flat. These would normally be expected to
rise at this stage of a recovery.
Overseas profits, up from Pounds 12.1m to Pounds 13.9m, would have been
higher but for a Pounds 1m reduction in South Africa, where the market had
been distracted by the national elections. UK profits had increased by 81
per cent to Pounds 9.6m (Pounds 5.3m).
The company had continued to benefit from cost savings made in the early
1990s, with a further Pounds 800,000 of savings made at Marley Building
Materials in the first half, said Mr Trapnell. Worldwide group operating
profits had risen by 35 per cent to Pounds 23.5m.
COMMENT
Marley, rightly, is reaping the benefit of its improved efficiency. Concrete
and clay products traditionally do better during the early stages of a
building recovery, and operating margins on continuing businesses rose by a
fifth in the first half. Concerns rest more with its roof tile business,
where competition has been intense, and slow progress in the repair and
maintenance sector, which typically benefits the 'lighter' building
products. The positives, however, outweigh the negatives, and pre-tax
profits of Pounds 47.5m for 1994 and Pounds 55m for 1995 would place the
shares on 13.5 times and 12 times earnings respectively. The shares look
fully valued given that most of Marley's virtues were already known.

FT  25 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Caparo deal may soon get court approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Caparo Group, the privately-owned UK steel and engineering business, expects
to win court approval in the next two weeks for its acquisition of
Pennsylvania-based Sharon Speciality Steel, writes Tim Burt.
Mr Swraj Paul, the Anglo-Indian businessman who founded and chairs Caparo,
said the group had given court officials details of its plans for the US
group, which has been operating under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code
for more than a year.
'We are planning to spend Dollars 25m (Pounds 16m) on expanding the plant
and talks are already taking place with the unions about re-employing the
workforce,' he said yesterday.
The move follows lengthy negotiations with Sharon's creditors, who are
understood to have welcomed the Caparo approach.

FT  25 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Victaulic bolstered by acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Victaulic, the maker of pipeline products for the gas, water, construction
and mining industries, lifted pre-tax profits 7 per cent in the first half
of 1994, helped by input from acquisitions and higher overseas sales.
Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 6.2m (Pounds 5.8m) on turnover up 12 per cent
at Pounds 57.6m (Pounds 51.5m).
Mr David Stewart, managing director, explained that as the 'long-standing,
traditional, high-margin' business from British Gas had been reduced on the
back of anti-monopoly regulation, so the group had picked up new business
which, because of the learning curve, was lower margin.
Sales to the UK gas industry are now only 17 per cent of turnover, compared
with 34 per cent in 1991. However, Mr Stewart said there had been no loss of
market share.
The 1994 acquisitions made operating profits of Pounds 400,000 on turnover
of Pounds 3m, with Action Hose Couplings, acquired in 1993, accounting for
Pounds 200,000. Victaulic has spent Pounds 11m on acquisitions since June
1993 and Pounds 16m since 1992.
At the period-end cash balances stood at Pounds 6.7m (Pounds 9.6m), leading
to interest receivable of Pounds 200,000. Mr David Winch, chairman, said the
company was 'generating more cash than we can spend', though he added that
the 'strike rate on acquisitions is quite low'. The group wants to expand in
continental Europe, the UK and east Asia, though the latter would be with
partners.
In April the company acquired a 51 per cent stake in Blakeborough Valves in
Singapore and Malaysia, which could open up sourcing possibilities and new
markets in east Asia, especially China.
Overseas sales advanced 18 per cent to Pounds 14m - some 24 per cent of
total turnover. Earnings worked through at 9.4p (8.8p) per share and the
interim dividend is lifted 0.1p to 2.6p. The shares closed down 3p at 274p.

FT  25 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Boards of utilities likened to pirates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Directors of the privatised water and electricity supply companies were
yesterday likened to pirates by Sir Anthony Beaumont-Dark, the former MP and
chairman of TR High Income Trust.
'They control monopolies and give themselves huge increases in pay,' he
said. 'They are like modern pirates pillaging their companies.'
At his instigation TR High Income has adopted a policy of opposing
three-year rolling contracts and 'excessive rewards which appear to be
unjustified by performance'.
Sir Anthony added that his trust was small, but he hoped that others would
follow suit. 'It is the institutions which have the muscle to make sure this
sort of thing is stopped.'
TR High Income's assets totalled Pounds 27.8m at June 30 with its 10 largest
investments including South West Water, British Gas, Northern Electricity
and Southern Water. 'They can all look forward to having their actions
closely watched,' said Sir Anthony.
He added: 'What appals me most is not the rolling contracts, but directors
who get huge increases despite the company making losses. And at the same
time there are a lot of people who work damned hard and don't get paid
anything like as much.'
Sir Anthony made his comments as TR High Income Trust announced results for
the half year to the end of June showing net revenue down from Pounds
825,000 to Pounds 789,000.
Earnings per share were lower at 3.11p (3.27p) reflecting reduced holdings
of fixed interest securities. A second interim dividend of 1.5p (1.4p) is
declared.
Net asset value per share at the end of June was 119.5p, against 144.5p at
the December 31 year end and 120.9p a year earlier. The fully diluted
figures were 116.4p, 137.2p and 117.5p.

FT  25 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Purchases help EFT show 41% upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EFT Group, the Glasgow-based asset finance company, increased pre-tax
profits by 41 per cent from Pounds 881,000 to Pounds 1.24m in the first half
of 1994, on revenue up 17 per cent from Pounds 3.66m to Pounds 4.28m.
Operating profits, before movements in bad debt provisions, increased 26 per
cent at Pounds 1.29m. Better-than-expected contributions from acquisitions
and a substantial rise in non-interest income from asset finance offset the
effect of tighter lending margins on new business.
New business volumes totalled Pounds 21m, up 13 per cent. Net outstanding
receivables rose 9 per cent to Pounds 58.3m.
In June, EFT raised Pounds 2.56m via a placing and open offer, having agreed
Pounds 13.5m in extra banking facilities. Mr Hamish Grossart, chairman, said
the two measures had substantially increased available funding and would
allow the business to grow for the foreseeable future.
The group was benefiting from the improved economic background and trading
since the first half. He was confident of a very good result for the year as
a whole.
In the second half EFT expects to benefit from its 60 per cent share of a
bonus paid to Mr Peter Stevenson, its former executive chairman who became
chairman of Mackays Stores in 1990. Last year EFT rejected an offer to buy
out the bonus, payable in 1994 and 1995, for Pounds 650,000.
Earnings per share this time rose 44 per cent to 2.57p (1.79p). The interim
dividend is increased to 0.525p (0.46p).

FT  25 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Equifax raises UAPT bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Equifax, the US credit data group, yesterday fended off what would have been
a terminal blow in its bid for UAPT-Infolink, by raising its offer for the
UK company to 650p a share.
Equifax is involved in a fight with Trans Union, its main US rival, for the
hand of UAPT, the credit referencing company. An initial 500p bid was topped
by a 550p offer from Trans Union, but Equifax hit back with a 600p offer.
However, the bidding war was complicated by the fact that Equifax owns a
credit information business in the UK, and is faced with a possible referral
to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission by the Office of Fair Trading.
Trans Union, which has no UK operations, therefore won the board's
recommendation.
The fight came to a head yesterday when a group of five institutions,
representing 21 per cent of UAPT's shares, were about to accept the 550p
Trans Union offer.
The offer compares favourably with a share price as low as 75p earlier this
year.
Equifax has now persuaded those institutions to defer judgment until an OFT
decision is made, in exchange for the offer of 650p a share.
In addition, the board of UAPT has agreed to rescind its recommendation of
the Trans Union offer.
Trans Union's bid is due to close on August 31, but it can be extended.
However, Trans Union has stated that it will under no circumstances raise
its offer. The OFT will therefore decide the outcome. Its decision is
expected shortly.

FT  25 AUG 94 / IBM picks up the gauntlet in the PC price war: The response
of rivals to Compaq's cuts is quickly gathering momentum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US personal computer market has been hit by 'Compaq Shock' as
competitors scramble to match last week's action by Compaq Computer that
reduced prices of many of its PCs by 11 to 22 per cent.
Yesterday, IBM announced broad price cuts of up to 27 per cent, matching
Compaq's new prices on most models and undercutting its rival by about 5 per
cent in the important 'PC server' segment.
The situation is reminiscent of the 'Compaq Shock' that hit the Japanese PC
market two years ago when Compaq dropped its prices and bulldozed its way
into a market formerly dominated by NEC. This time Compaq's targets are IBM
and Apple Computer - for many years the leading US PC suppliers. Compaq has
vowed to overtake them to become the world market leader by 1996.
Armed with Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.4bn) worth of inventory which it hopes to
unleash on the market over the October to year-end quarter, typically the
peak PC selling season, Compaq is gearing up for battle.
With gross profit margins well above those of its competitors, Compaq can
afford to engage in a price war, say industry analysts. IBM has been quick
to respond to Compaq's price cuts and other leading PC makers are expected
to follow suit. Hewlett-Packard said yesterday that it would undercut
Compaq's new prices in about two weeks, while Digital Equipment has also
vowed to remain price competitive. The response of smaller PC companies is
less predictable. 'My gut feeling is that some competitors will react and
some will not. It depends on their overall strategy,' said Mr John Carlo
Bisone, Compaq's senior vice-president of North American marketing.
Compaq's attack comes at a particularly vulnerable time for its biggest
competitors. IBM is in the middle of restructuring its PC business while
Apple is making a transition to PowerPC microprocessor technology.
The price war could prove particularly costly to IBM, which is struggling to
regain momentum in the PC market. IBM's second-quarter US shipments dropped
29 per cent, as shipment volume at its four top rivals rose.
In the second quarter, Compaq had a 14.3 per cent share of the US market,
according to Dataquest. Apple Computer had an 11.2 per cent share; Packard
Bell Electronics had 9.3 per cent and IBM trailed at 7.9 per cent.
IBM's profit margins in the PC business are also well below those of Compaq,
which claims to be the market's lowest-cost producer. The new price cuts
will further reduce profit margins, but the company must respond to Compaq's
price challenge if it is not to see its market share dwindle.
Fuelling the battle in the PC industry are sharp price reductions by Intel,
the leading supplier of microprocessor chips. Over the past four months
Intel has lowered prices on its 486 and Pentium chips by about 40 per cent.
This has given PC makers an opportunity to trim their prices, while
maintaining profit margins.
Another factor that is adding momentum to the PC price war is the broad
availability of products. Over the past two years, PC makers have frequently
been unable to keep pace with demand for their products because of component
shortages. Most of these problems have now been solved and the industry has
a glut of products that it is anxious to unleash on the market.
The price cuts are also seen as a precursor to the introduction of new
products as the market shifts toward higher performance machines based on
Intel's Pentium microprocessors.
Television advertising will for the first time in several years become a
weapon in the looming PC marketing battle, with Compaq planning to double
its spending on US television commercials over the next three months and IBM
planning to return to TV advertising for the first time in years. Intel is
also planning its most ambitious TV advertising campaign to date.
'A fundamental shift in the market is taking place,' said Mr Dennis Carter,
Intel vice-president for marketing, adding that PC sales to home users are
exploding. In the fourth quarter of 1993, US sales of PCs to consumers
outstripped sales to businesses for the first time.
However, while Intel is aiming its marketing campaign at home PC users, the
focus of the PC pricing activities is in the corporate market, which
typically includes higher performance computers that command higher prices
and profit margins.
IBM's price cuts are particularly aggressive on 'PC servers'. The largest
IBM price drop is on a PC Server Array formerly priced at Dollars 13,090
which will now carry a list price of Dollars 9,500. This compares with
Compaq's price, on an equivalent PC server, of Dollars 10,000.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Seeboard share buy-back spurs Recs to new highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in most regional electricity companies rose to record levels
yesterday after Crawley-based Seeboard joined what could become a rush by
the companies to buy back their own shares.
Yesterday's increases mean the companies have seen their market values rise
16 per cent on average in the two weeks since the industry regulator
announced a pricing regime generally regarded as favourable to the industry.
Yesterday's rises alone added Pounds 460m to the companies' market values
taking the total to more than Pounds 17bn. Analysts predicted further
increases immediately and in the long term.
Some said there could be falls for a short period after mid-October, when
share buy-backs would be ruled out before the annual results season.
However, others believe an expected announcement in October on the National
Grid, which the companies are likely to float on the stock market next
spring, could keep share prices high.
Seeboard is the second of the companies, after Eastern, to buy back its
shares but the first to do so since the regulator announced the pricing
review.
It made the purchases on Tuesday, paying 425p for 2m of its 257m shares in
issue. Like seven other regional companies Seeboard's shares, at 438p, up
17p, were at a record high last night.
All the regional companies have powers to buy back shares, mostly for up to
10 per cent of their equity, and all are well equipped financially to do so.
Each either has cash in hand or low borrowings. Buying back shares will
benefit earnings per share and the potential to increase dividend payments,
even if share prices rise further.
However the scope for effecting buy-backs is limited. Stock exchange rules
mean companies cannot pay more than 5 per cent above the average share price
on the previous 10 days.
That may be a constraint, with share prices rises. However, there should be
some days when prices fall and companies can buy in the market.
Postponing share buy-backs could mean a long delay as the companies will be
forbidden from trading their shares during the results season and,
potentially, after then because of the grid flotation. Knowledge of the
flotation details would give the companies insider knowledge.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Telegraph begins to feel price pain: Pre-tax profits slip
12% to Pounds 30.3m in first half and Conrad Black acknowledges 'severe
effects' of the cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Conrad Black, chairman of The Telegraph, said yesterday that price wars
in the UK's national newspaper industry represented the company's biggest
challenge since its move from Fleet Street eight years ago.
'We look forward to meeting that challenge,' said Mr Black as he announced a
12 per cent fall in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 30.3m, from Pounds
34.6m, although the 1993 interim figures were helped by the sale of
investments.
The price-cutting war launched by Mr Rupert Murdoch's The Times has eaten
into Telegraph profits. The decision to counterattack, by cutting the
weekday price of the Daily Telegraph to 30p, cost the group Pounds 1m in the
six days of the change included in the six months accounting period to June
30. A further Pounds 1m was spent on a voucher scheme - a form of
discounting used before the price cut.
In addition, Pounds 8m was spent on promotion during the period to protect
the Daily Telegraph's circulation against the 20p Times.
Mr Black acknowledged yesterday that the 'severe effects' of the cover price
reduction would be reflected in group results in the shorter term, and
promotional costs to support the titles would continue to be significant.
'We are dedicated to maintaining the quality of our products and the
pre-eminence of these products in the newspaper advertising industry,' said
Mr Black.
Since the Daily Telegraph cut its price, circulation has increased from
about 993,000 to 1.07m.
Mr Black added that areas had been identified where costs could be saved.
Promotion expenses, for example, would be reduced in the second half.
Mr Stephen Grabiner, the Telegraph's managing director, said the irony was
that the new readers were largely the young people the Telegraph had tried
and failed to attract in the past.
'We could end up with a better readership profile as a result of this. That
is the only good news there is now.' Mr Grabiner added that the company
could not 'afford to blink' in the price wars.
The drop in UK circulation revenues of around 4 per cent was offset by good
results from the John Fairfax newspaper group in Australia, an associate
company. The contributions from associates more than doubled from Pounds
4.4m to Pounds 11.8m.
Operating profit at The Telegraph was down by Pounds 3.5m at Pounds 20.3m.
Earnings per share were 15.8p. This compared with 13.4p excluding the
effects of investment sales and 16.6p including them.
The interim dividend remains unchanged at 5.5p.

FT  25 AUG 94 / W H Smith confident on book law change: Charges reduce
annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 83m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WH Smith, the retailing group, said yesterday it was confident it could
withstand the possible removal of the net book agreement, which keeps book
prices at fixed levels in the UK. It also reported a fall in annual pre-tax
profits from Pounds 113.8m to Pounds 83.4m.
Sir Malcolm Field, chief executive, said last week's decision by the Office
of Fair Trading to refer the net book agreement to the restrictive practices
court was not a cause for concern.
'We have not got hard figures as to what life would be like without the
agreement. What we have got is a strategy for prospering without it,' he
said. WH Smith had experience of a price-competitive book market in the US,
and was confident of recouping lost gross margin by increasing UK market
share, if price-cutting were legalised.
The full-year results were hit by exceptional costs of Pounds 36.6m for
rationalisation of Do It All, the DIY joint venture with Boots, denting an
otherwise encouraging performance. Adding back those costs and Pounds 6m of
restructuring charges for the WH Smith chain - offset by Pounds 1.2m profits
on disposals - underlying pre-tax profits were up 13 per cent at Pounds
124.8m.
Sir Malcolm said capital expenditure would be a record Pounds 140m this
year. Some Pounds 50m would be spent on adding 230,000 sq ft of selling
space to the existing 3.5m sq ft.
Group sales for the 52 weeks to May 28 increased 5.6 per cent to Pounds
2.44bn. Since then sales and profits were 'marginally ahead', in spite of
consumer caution.
Sales in the UK retail division, including WH Smith, Waterstones, Our Price
and Virgin, increased 4.8 per cent to Pounds 1.35bn, with operating profits
up 9.1 per cent to Pounds 93.8m.
Losses at Do It All fell from Pounds 14.3m to Pounds 10.5m. The chain is
being reduced to a 'core' of 137 stores and is expected to return to profit
next year.
Profits in the distribution business rose 13.6 per cent to Pounds 37.7m, on
sales up 5.9 per cent at Pounds 1.02bn.
In the US, sales grew 11.3 per cent to Pounds 223m, and profits 7.3 per cent
to Pounds 11.8m. The group plans to expand Waterstones in the US.
A final dividend of 10.4p lifts the total payout 8.5 per cent to 15.4p.
Earnings per share, after exceptional items, fell from 31.1p to 20.2p.

FT  25 AUG 94 / US fund irked by Body Shop reaction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US ethical investment fund that sold its shares in Body Shop
International has criticised the cosmetics and toiletries group for the way
in which the fund's views have been represented.
Franklin Research and Development, the Boston-based organisation, said
yesterday that - contrary to Body Shop's assertions - its concerns about the
company's green and ethical image were among the reasons for its decision to
sell.
News of Franklin's decision to dispose of 50,000 Body Shop shares and to
recommend its clients to do likewise has triggered an intense debate. It has
also prompted Body Shop to claim that Franklin had said its views had been
misrepresented in the press.
However, Mr Patrick McVeigh, Franklin's senior vice president, said
yesterday his organisation had been put under pressure by Body Shop, and was
'not pleased' by the way its views had been characterised.
His comments follow suggestions that Franklin decided to sell its shares
purely on commercial grounds: because of competition and the potential
impact of allegations - expected to be published in the US press - on the
share price. 'We certainly had ethical concerns, if not we would not have
sold the stock,' he said. 'We do not sell stock based on every short-term
rumour.'
One article is expected in Business Ethics magazine next week. Franklin is
also in discussions with Body Shop over an article in its own newsletter and
over any revised recommendation - it is still advising clients to sell.
Mr McVeigh said Body Shop's behaviour towards Franklin 'could not help but
influence' its final assessment of the company.
Body Shop yesterday confirmed it had held discussions with the US Federal
Trade Commission, which is investigating disputes with franchisees. It had
received one request for information from the FTC nine months ago with which
it had co-operated fully.
'Any federal agency in the US upon receiving a complaint - whatever the
source - is forced to investigate.' Many franchisees were asking for more
shops. 'This is hardly a system in disarray.' Mr Gordon Roddick, chairman,
expressed frustration at 'innuendo' from 'the zealots of cynicism'.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Accountants face tough new monitoring rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Accountants in public practice would be subject to tough new monitoring and
continuing education requirements, under sweeping proposals released
yesterday by their leading professional bodies.
All accountants in positions of influence holding a practising certificate
would be required to continue to attend training every year if they were to
retain their licence to operate.
A small proportion of accountants outside the existing regulated areas would
also become subject to monitoring for the first time.
The proposals come in a document from the professional standards review
working party, comprising members of the three professional chartered
accountancy bodies covering England and Wales, Scotland and Ireland. Under
existing regulations, accountants offering investment advice, auditing
services and insolvency have become subject to regular examination by
self-regulatory bodies.
However, the proposals suggest introducing powers to allow accountancy
institutes to examine members of firms outside these areas, and to inspect
practices offering additional services such as tax advice.
Those most likely to be inspected would be those handling clients' money.
This would be to ensure their compliance with existing regulations. It might
also include any other practices to which the institutes were alerted by
complaints from the public.
Mr Bruce Picking, director of practice regulation at the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, stressed that only a small
proportion of firms would be subject to inspection - perhaps 3 per cent of
the total.
Every 'principal' in an accountancy practice - which ranges from the sole
practitioner to any partner in a large firm - is presently required to hold
a practising certificate.
Under the present system, all requirements for continuing education cease
once the certificate has been awarded. Accountants who qualified before 1974
are not even required to complete the education requirements, and others
qualifying before 1978 can claim exemptions.
The changes would allow certificates to be issued subject to certain
potentially wide-ranging conditions. The institutes expect to conclude
discussions on the proposals in January and begin implementation in early
1996.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Vocational students win higher rate of university places
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first wave of students completing the government's new sixth-form
vocational qualifications were more successful in winning offers of
university places this year than A-level candidates.
The results published today for advanced general national vocational
qualifications (GNVQs), introduced as a pilot scheme two years ago, were
welcomed by the government as a crucial boost to its attempts to improve the
UK training base.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, said the results were 'an
historic step towards giving the country the vocational skills we need for
the future'.
She added that they had given 16-year-olds 'the freedom to choose a path
where they can best prove their talents'.
The government hopes that by 1996 a quarter of all 16-year-olds will embark
on the courses.
Of the 900 GNVQ candidates who applied for university, 85 per cent were
offered places, compared with 76 per cent of applicants taking A-levels. In
total, 1,236 passed the advanced GNVQ, while 15,587 passed the intermediate
GNVQ, designed to be equivalent to the GCSE exams taken mainly by
16-year-olds.
The National Council for Vocational Qualifications, the employment
department quango responsible for the new qualifications, hailed the results
as evidence that they had earned the respect of universities and employers.
The council also said fewer than a third of the 3,800 students who
registered for the first year of GNVQs had completed the qualifications
within the recommended two years, suggesting that the courses were not an
'easy option'.
At least 50,000 applications are expected for advanced GNVQs, starting next
month, but some educationalists remain critical of the qualifications, which
involve assessing skills through a series of units, rather than taking
traditional written exams.
Professor Alan Smithers, of Manchester University, said: 'The fact that lots
have not completed the course is neither good news nor bad. Students are
working through courses at their own pace but they are still being judged at
the end by low and unreliable standards.'
The advanced GNVQs offered this year covered five broad vocational subjects
 -art and design; business studies; health and social care; leisure and
tourism; and manufacturing. From next month, they will also be available in
built environment, hospitality and catering, and science.
Mrs Shephard also welcomed results from this year's GCSE examinations
showing increased interest in maths and science.

FT  25 AUG 94 / China orders controls on food prices as inflation hits 24.2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China signalled its alarm yesterday at a big jump in retail inflation by
ordering a nation-wide drive against food price rises, the main cause of the
latest inflationary surge.
The country's newspapers, reflecting government concerns about social
unrest, headlined a directive from the ministry of internal trade calling on
state food distribution agencies to 'stabilise' the market.
This demand coincided with the release of inflation figures for the 35 main
cities showing that retail prices rose by 24.2 per cent in the 12 months to
July. Prices were much higher than previous months because of big increases
in staple commodities such as grain, vegetables and pork.
The jump in July prices, reversing the moderating trend of the first six
months, has unnerved the government, which had believed its tight money
policies were beginning to counter an inflationary spiral.
There was no mention in the directive of the reintroduction of price
controls on staples, but localities were authorised to distribute
commodities from stockpiles or use special funds earmarked for the purpose
to stabilise prices.
Official worries about possible social unrest fuelled by rising prices
follow the release last week of figures showing that capital spending in
July had leapt by 72.9 per cent compared with the same period last year.
While western economists cautioned that not too much could be read into one
month's fixed asset investment figures, the government was sufficiently
concerned to announce it was tightening credit.
The authorities are almost certainly bracing themselves for more bad news,
with pressures on food prices in both southern China, where there has been
widespread flooding, and the north, which has been suffering from drought.
Beijing has also promised hard-pressed farmers further increases in grain
prices.
The state statistical bureau reported that the food price index for
city-dwellers rose 31.9 per cent in July compared with the same month last
year. Grain prices jumped by 57.8 per cent and vegetables by 29.7 per cent.
The government's target of national retail inflation of 10 per cent for 1994
is now certain to be surpassed.

FT  25 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: UK electricity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Seeboard's purchase of 2m of its own shares should herald the beginning of a
wholesale capital reconstruction of the electricity sector. But shareholders
will only derive the full benefits if regional electricity companies reshape
their balance sheets with vigour. Seeboard's buy-back corresponds to less
than 1 per cent of its equity. Even buy-backs of 10 per cent - the maximum
most companies have the authority for - would still leave the industry with
gearing of about 10 per cent. Companies should be thinking of cutting their
equity by at least twice that amount.
The immediate advantage of a buy-back is to boost earnings per share. The
consequent loss of interest income is more than compensated for by the
cancellation of shares. Analysts estimate that, for a typical rec, buying
back 10 per cent of its equity would enhance eanings per share by roughly 5
per cent. Another advantage for shareholders is that a buy-back reduces the
risk that cash could end up in somebody else's pocket. It is not merely that
managements might embark on unwise acquisitions. Cash piles could also prove
an easy source of taxation for an incoming Labour government.
Whether Seeboard has chosen the best way of handing cash back to its
shareholders is more questionable. Recs will have to pay advance corporation
tax on share purchases through the market. For tax-exempt investors, a share
tender or some other mechanism that allowed them to reclaim tax would be
preferable.

FT  25 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: WH Smith
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Those seeking reasons for not buying shares in WH Smith have rarely had to
look far. Of late they have been spoilt for choice. They could worry about
monopoly inquiries into newspaper distribution or compact discs, the losses
at Our Price, the group's ability to compete in a low inflation world, the
future of the Net Book Agreement, the rising tax charge, the falling pension
credit, or the continuing nightmare that is Do It All. For the really
fastidious there was even a two tier share structure.
Now the doubters are having to work harder. The two classes of share have
gone, Our Price is back in profit, the group has shown it can live without
inflation and it rightly sees the likely collapse of the NBA as an
opportunity to gain market share. Even losses from Do It All are coming down
and will be largely swept under the carpet this year.
The pessimists can still fret about the growth prospects for the WH Smith
chain. But there remains room to tickle up margins, as the investment in
technology continues, and it is now taking advantage of weakened competitors
to open more space. The Virgin and Waterstone's formats still have a long
way to go, with the full benefits of integration into the group yet to come,
and there are clearly the makings of a useful business in the US even if the
 -reassuringly cautious - expansion in book retailing comes to little. Add
the fast-growing office supplies business to the mix and Smiths has a good
story to tell. Given fewer distractions, the sceptics might just start to
believe it.

FT  25 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Wellcome/SmithKline
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investing in pharmaceuticals companies was risky even before the recent
proliferation of legal actions. Glaxo is already entangled in the US courts
trying to defend its best selling product. Now Wellcome has followed suit,
claiming that the US patents of its anti-viral drug Zovirax have been
infringed by SmithKline Beecham's Famvir. In both cases investors are left
groping for hard information.
In theory it should be possible for the stock market to assess such legal
challenges by considering the chances of success or failure and the
potential profits at risk. Since Famvir has only been on sale for a matter
of weeks, though, even short-term forecasts are tricky. And it would take an
expert on US patent law to make a credible guess at Wellcome's chances of
success. If the case ends up being heard by a North Carolina jury rather
than a judge, as Wellcome has requested, the outcome will be even more
unpredictable.
The best that can be said is that the case is probably more important for
Wellcome than for SB. On even the most optimistic forecasts, US sales of
Famvir will account for a relatively small proportion of SB's profits by the
end of the decade. If Wellcome could clear the field for its own anti-viral
products the outlook for it would be markedly brighter. The rise in its
shares yesterday may reflect that line of thought. The snag is that
resorting to the courts undermines Wellcome's earlier argument that
competition would be good for Zovirax by increasing awareness among doctors
and expanding the market.

FT  25 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: IBM bytes back
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IBM had no choice but to match Compaq's sharp price cuts for personal
computers. Big Blue has already lost lead position in the US pc market to
its slimmer and faster rival and cannot afford to see the erosion go much
further. Even so, the company will be hard pressed to win a head-to-head
price war. Compaq not only has lower costs. It has proved more adept at
selling its boxes through dealers and has successfully established a
reputation for selling high quality computers at low prices. Given that
IBM's pc business is scarcely profitable, the price cuts of up to 27 per
cent will cost it dearly.
IBM's only alternative would be to differentiate its products from those of
its rivals. Until recently, that seemed its strategy. It planned to push
PowerPC, the chip it has developed with Apple and Motorola, as a new
industry standard for personal computers. The snag is that software is
typically written to work with the Intel chips which sit inside most pcs
and, without a wide range of software, customers are unlikely to switch
technology. The latest comments from IBM's new pc chief Mr Rick Thoman
indicate that he is retreating from the PowerPC strategy.
IBM is therefore reduced to joining the price war. To hold its own, the pc
division will have to slash costs and transform its sleepy culture. IBM,
under its chairman Mr Louis Gerstner, has already surprised financial
markets by how quickly it can cut costs. So success cannot be ruled out. In
the meantime, the real winner from the price war will be Intel.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Suitable schemes for cutting: Lisa Wood says it may be
difficult to identify savings in the UK publicly funded training budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Cann, a Lancashire businessman, shakes his head at reports that Mr
Michael Portillo, UK employment secretary, wants to slash the government's
Pounds 1.8bn training budget.
'The free market will not sort out the training of young people and
unemployed adults who are the main recipients of government-funded
programmes,' says Mr Cann, chairman of East Lancashire Training and
Enterprise Council (Tec), one of 82 in England and Wales which administer
publicly funded training on behalf of the employment department.
The Tecs, independent companies run by private-sector business leaders, have
been thrust into the spotlight by recent, unconfirmed newspaper reports that
Mr Portillo wants to halve their training budget. The debate over their
future will be fuelled today when league tables are published showing how
successful they have been over the past year in finding jobs for, and
improving the skills of, unemployed people.
Mr Portillo, a standard-bearer of Thatcherite ideas and a keen supporter of
freeing labour markets from state involvement, has made no comment about
possible cuts; neither has he squashed media speculation.
As the government approaches its autumn spending review and looks for ways
to cut the Pounds 50bn public-sector borrowing requirement, however, Mr
Portillo is thought to be seeking ways to save some of his department's
overall annual spending of Pounds 3.7bn.
Officials in his department say that he has asked them to detail expenditure
on training programmes, and to assess both their value for money and the
possible political reaction were training budget cuts to be agreed in the
public expenditure negotiations. 'We are at the shadow-boxing stage with the
Treasury,' said one official.
Any cuts in the training budget would be at the expense of the Tecs, which
the government set up four years ago to take over the administration of
publicly funded training. The two main schemes administered by the Tecs are
Youth Training, a programme for young people with guaranteed places, and
Training for Work, for long-term unemployed adults. Most have been jobless
for more than a year.
Tecs, which receive most of their Pounds 1.8bn funding for these two
programmes, are allotted individual budgets under complicated formulas which
take into account the levels of unemployment in their areas.
So how much scope is there for savings in the Department of Employment's
training budget? And is the government prepared to curb the state's role in
training amid general acknowledgement by industry that the UK's underskilled
workforce is putting the country at a competitive disadvantage?
Speculation about Mr Portillo's agenda at his new department has been stoked
by comments from a small group of rightwing Tory backbenchers, determined to
minimise the role of the state. Mr Nick Budgen, a maverick rightwinger, is
sceptical about the role of government in training. Offering training
schemes to upgrade skills, he says, was intended only as a temporary measure
in the 1970s.
'Now,' he says, 'training by the state is applauded as a permanent part of
the economy. I want to question that.' This reappraisal has not been on the
political agenda for several years. Tory and Labour governments since the
early 1970s have accepted that the state has a significant role to play in
training the unemployed. Sustained economic growth alone is not seen as the
solution to long-term unemployment, while market forces tend to
under-provide the skills needed for workers to compete in an increasingly
demanding jobs environment.
This view of the importance of state backing found some support in the
recent white paper on competitiveness, published in May by Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. It said that government-backed
training formed part of the 'active measures' that a flexible labour market
needs to help unemployed people back into work.
Mr Portillo's expenditure review will not only consider the strength of this
argument but try to ascertain whether the two main Tec schemes offer value
for money.
It will focus first on Youth Training. Despite the 'guarantee' of a place
for any young person that wants one, some 59,000 young people are estimated
to be falling through the net - neither on a YT course, nor in a job. One of
the main reasons that young people do not take up a YT place concerns the
benefit allowance. If they receive training but no offer of a job, they are
entitled to a state allowance of Pounds 29.50 a week, a sum which many
consider too low. Were it to be cut, Mr Peter Ashby, of Full Employment UK,
an employment consultancy, says: 'The YTs' reputation will fall further,
with more young people joining those who drop out.'
Mr Ashby points out that the government plans to upgrade training for young
people with the introduction of 'modern apprenticeships'. These aim to
provide higher skills than currently achieved through YT. Mr David Hunt,
shortly before the cabinet reshuffle which ended his term as employment
secretary, pledged extra government funding for this more expensive
programme, also to be administered by Tecs, to encourage employers to take
on trainees. Any cuts Mr Portillo might contemplate in the scheme, would
undermine what the government sees as a flagship venture.
The main area which Mr Portillo is likely to look at, therefore, is the
Pounds 705m-a-year Training for Work scheme for unemployed adults, which
replaced Employment Training last year. The programme has been criticised
for several failings - even by some Tecs, which suggest that fewer people
should be accepted on the scheme but more money should be spent on training
individuals, who receive Pounds 10 a week plus their unemployment benefits.
Detractors, including Labour MPs such as shadow transport secretary Mr Frank
Dobson, a former employment spokesman, claim that fewer than a third of
participants get jobs.
However, the league tables to be published today may dispel some of the
criticisms about the performance of Training for Work. Most Tecs are
expected to show improvements in finding jobs for the unemployed, despite
progressive cuts in funding to programmes for the unemployed over the past
three years. Mr Mike Nixon, chief executive of North London Tec, which now
gets 54 per cent of Training for Work participants into a job compared with
10.65 per cent when it inherited the scheme, says: 'TFW is now looking
good.'
In his search for savings, Mr Portillo may decide that cheaper, non-training
alternatives to Training for Work offer one solution. Job Clubs, for
example, provide short courses where the unemployed learn basic skills to
'enhance their job-hunting techniques', such as how to fill out a curriculum
vitae. The clubs seek to get people back into work quickly without upgrading
their work skills.
Employment department officials will probably tell Mr Portillo that it is
difficult to compare the long-term success of training schemes with that of
Jobclubs. It may initially be cheaper to get an unemployed person back into
work through a Jobclub, but many such jobs are short-lived, while an
individual whose skills have been upgraded may get a better-paying,
permanent job. Employment department officials believe the trade-offs
between funding and jobs are more complex than they may appear.
The employment secretary will have to weigh up the relative gains provided
to the individual and to the overall UK economy by publicly funded training
schemes. Even if he decided to slash the Pounds 705m cost of Training for
Work tomorrow, the government would still be faced with a massive
unemployment benefits bill. In addition, about a quarter of the UK's
training budget for unemployed adults comes from the European Union, which
would be lost if the Tecs' main scheme was axed.
Mr Portillo's cost-cutting choices will thus be limited. Some Tecs could
undoubtedly improve their performance, but cutting the amount they can spend
on unemployed individuals may not enhance their success rate. Mr Chris
Humphries, policy director of the Tecs' National Council, says: 'I believe
the league tables will show substantial improvements. We hope that this will
be acknowledged by maintenance of budgets, not cuts.'
