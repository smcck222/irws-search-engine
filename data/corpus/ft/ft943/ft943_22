FT  23 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Milk turns sour
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It did not require a profound knowledge of game theory to predict that the
new mechanism for setting prices in the UK milk market could go badly wrong.
After three rounds of a blind auction by Milk Marque, the co-operative that
controls two-thirds of the country's milk production, the dairy industry was
still bidding for more milk than was on offer. By stopping the process at
that point, Milk Marque has in effect admitted that the auction process was
flawed.
Whether, as it argues, it called a halt before much of the industry bid
itself out of business remains to be seen. Not only were milk purchasers
prepared to take the bidding higher, the big dairy groups have offered a
premium above the Milk Marque price to farmers prepared to supply them
directly. But, in itself, this does not undermine the industry's claim that
serious damage will be done by the new prices.
The liquid milk business, where the likes of Northern Foods and Unigate make
good returns, faces the smallest price increase, though it will be difficult
to pass on much of the rise into the declining doorstep market or the price
warring supermarkets. It is butter and cheese producers who will be hit
hardest because their milk price was artificially low under the old regime.
Returns here are already fairly meagre and the price rises proposed are
likely to hasten a reduction in overcapacity. The banks have just decided to
pull the plug on the Scottish Milk Marketing Board's Galloway Cheese
Company. Unless Milk Marque is forced to relent, an early flotation of Dairy
Crest looks out of the question.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Germany's nuclear fall-out: A look at the increasingly
controversial debate on how best to dispose of the country's nuclear waste
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seventeen years ago, the little village of Gorleben was a forgotten
backwater on the banks of the river Elbe, a stone's throw from East German
no-man's land.
Today its name is synonymous with an impassioned debate over the future of
Germany's nuclear power industry.
The fate of Gorleben could decide whether nuclear power has a future at all
in Germany. It could also have a big influence on the attempts by other
countries - such as the UK, Sweden, Switzerland and many others - to find an
economic and publicly acceptable way of disposing of their nuclear waste,
most probably underground.
In 1977, the village was a depopulated rural retreat in a blighted border
area of West Germany, its main roads cut on three sides by the East German
frontier. It was the ideal place to put something unpleasant - like a
nuclear waste dump.
At the time, the government called it a 'nuclear park', and planned to
include a huge reprocessing plant, employing 5,000 people, as well as
excavate a vast underground cavern in the nearby salt deposit, to dispose of
highly radioactive waste. It would have been the German equivalent of
Britain's Sellafield, or France's La Hague, with waste disposal thrown in.
Seventeen years and interminable planning inquiries later, not to mention
changes of government both in Bonn and Hanover, capital of the local state
of Lower Saxony, and innumerable protests, sit-ins and marches, the
reprocessing plant has been abandoned, and the waste disposal plan is still
the subject of furious resistance.
A huge interim waste disposal site has been developed behind
three-metre-high security fences and a rampart of earth. But the biggest
storage shed, for containers full of highly radioactive materials, is still
standing empty after 11 years.
On the same site, an extraordinary 'pilot conditioning plant' is being
built, with massive reinforced concrete walls, 1.5 metres thick, where the
waste has to be repackaged into containers capable of keeping it underground
for its entire half-life - of 10,000 years or more. Objections to its
construction from the state government and environmental groups have delayed
completion by at least two years already.
Over the road, just 1km outside Gorleben village, two deep shafts have been
sunk into the salt 'dome', to carry out exhaustive tests on its quality and
consistency to see if it can safely be used as a permanent deep storage site
for the waste.
To complicate matters, since 1990 Gorleben has been at the heart of reunited
Germany, instead of on a hostile frontier. The banks of the river Elbe have
been designated as a nature conservation area, and the idea of putting
nuclear waste down a salt mine on its doorstep seems incongruous in the
extreme.
In recent weeks, hundreds of demonstrators have blockaded the entrance to
the interim waste disposal site. They built a makeshift village, and tried
to tunnel under the road, to block deliveries of the first cast-iron
containers containing nuclear fuel elements to the temporary store.
They were forced to move, but an attempt by Mr Klaus Topfer, the (Christian
Democrat) federal environment minister, to negotiate an agreement on the
deliveries last week with Mr Gerhard Schroder, the (Social Democrat) state
premier in Lower Saxony, failed to break the latest deadlock.
Yet if agreement cannot be reached on the storage plans, it is not only
Germany's powerful nuclear industry, with 20 atomic energy plants churning
out electricity, which will be held to ransom. The irony is that the
opponents of nuclear energy, including a clear majority of the opposition
Social Democratic party (SPD) and the whole of the environmentalist Green
party, also need to find a waste disposal site somewhere in Germany to bring
the industry to a halt. If the power stations are to close, something must
be done with their waste.
'With nuclear waste, to do nothing is worse than doing something, whichever
side you are on,' says Dr Rolf Meyer, spokesman for DBE, the state-owned
company responsible for excavating and evaluating the Gorleben salt mine. So
both sides know that, really, they have to reach some compromise.
For a long time, the anti-nuclear lobby has identified the disposal of
nuclear waste as the weak link in the German nuclear chain, and therefore
the best target to attack in trying to force the country to abandon nuclear
power altogether.
Hitherto, reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel has been the preferred German
approach, on the grounds that it would maximise re-use of the original raw
material, and minimise the eventual waste for disposal. Big reprocessing
contracts have been signed with France's Cogema and Britain's BNFL lasting
into the next century.
The problem is that reprocessing is very expensive; it produces plutonium,
which is dangerous because it can be used for weapons manufacture, and which
requires in turn being transformed into mixed oxide (MOX) fuel elements to
be reused in nuclear power stations; and it means that Germany remains
committed to nuclear power generation for the foreseeable future. On top of
that, it still produces a small amount of highly radioactive nuclear waste
which has to be got rid of somehow.
The alternative - direct disposal of spent fuel elements - is seen as much
cheaper, and it does give Germany the option eventually of closing down its
nuclear power stations, and switching back to conventional forms of power
generation.
The Greens and the rest of the anti-nuclear lobby have targeted the weak
links in the nuclear chain in two ways: they have sought to block approval
of Gorleben as a waste disposal site at every stage of the process; and they
have so far successfully blocked a series of building and planning licences
for Siemens's MOX fuel element plant at Hanau, near Frankfurt, which is
standing 95 per cent complete, at a cost to date of DM1.1bn (Pounds 461m).
The environmental blockade against both plans has proved remarkably
successful so far, and has cause great frustration in the nuclear power
industry. Both the big northern electricity utilities - RWE in Essen, and
Veba's PreussenElektra in Hanover - have shown serious signs of being
tempted to pull out of nuclear power generation altogether, although they
deny it officially. They are observing a de facto moratorium on plans for
any new nuclear power stations. What they want above all else is some sense
of certainty about the future of their industry - and about what they are
going to do with their toxic waste.
This month, Siemens won an important legal battle in the supreme
administrative court in Berlin, which rejected challenges to three building
licences for the Hanau plant. But complaints are still outstanding against
two further building licences, and four licences for the actual process of
uranium and plutonium processing.
As for Gorleben, even delivery of waste for interim storage still appears to
be blocked, most recently thanks to fears about the safety of the Castor
cast-iron containers being sent across country from the Philippsburg power
station in Baden-Wurttemberg. In the middle of a general election campaign,
no one can afford to seem complacent.
The vast echoing hall built for the high-level waste stands empty. It has
the capacity to take 420 of the Castor containers, each one separately wired
up to monitors, which check that the pressure between their double lids
remains constant, in case of a leak. Highly radioactive waste will also be
delivered from La Hague and Sellafield in vitrified glass containers, the
first due from France before the end of the year.
The containers are supposed to stay there for six years at least, while they
cool down from their initial 200`C. After that, they are supposed to go to
the 'conditioning' plant to prepare for permanent disposal in the salt mine.
'The building is simply for protection from the weather,' says Mr Jurgen
Auer of Brennelementlager Gorleben (BLG), which runs the site. 'The
containers are what are supposed to be secure.'
The pilot conditioning plant has been built, as Germany's safety laws
require, strong enough to withstand an earthquake, or the impact of a jet
aircraft flown into it at full speed. At its heart is a T-shaped core which
will be totally sealed from human entrance, or the escape of radiation
inside it.
Inside the cell, which has stainless steel plates bolted to its walls to be
washed down for radiation, the Castor containers are to be opened, and the
fuel elements compressed by remote control, before being repacked in
65-tonne Pollux containers for permanent disposal. Humans will supervise,
watching through massive lead-glass panes.
The final stage in the process, if it ever comes to pass, will be the
disposal of the radioactive material underground in the salt mine.
The huge deposit goes down to at least 4,000 metres, and the plan is to
excavate a complex of tunnels some 14km long, 4km wide, and up to 3.3km
deep.
One of the great advantages of salt is that it 'creeps': after being
hollowed out, it will gradually close in again on whatever has been stored.
It also conducts heat, allowing the very hot waste to cool, and it does not
conduct water. However, it is not pure, and some forms of salt contain water
in crystalline form: if it gets warm, it could dissolve and flow towards the
source of the heat.
Hence the need for exhaustive checks on the precise 'geo-mechanical'
properties of the Gorleben salt deposit, conducted with legendary German
efficiency: so far, 120km of borings have been carried out and tested over
the past 14 years.
Dr Meyer, spokesman for the DBE, is philosophical about the whole exercise.
'I sometimes wonder how they would ever have built the Pyramids, or the
Great Wall of China, if they hadn't had slaves,' he says. He expects a final
decision on whether the project will go ahead or not after the turn of the
century. Then it will take another six years to prepare - providing storage
space for another 70 years.
The mining project is being pursued with fanatical attention from the local
media. 'If a sparrow dies here on the mine, the local newspaper will call up
to find out why,' Dr Meyer says. 'Every single detail of our job is in the
public eye.'
But the most challenging task of all, he believes, has nothing directly to
do with the mining. 'How do you identify a nuclear waste disposal site for
500 years,' he asks, 'let alone for 10,000?'
The use of Gorleben as Germany's main site for nuclear waste disposal has
been a burning political issue in local politics, ever since it was first
mooted by the Christian Democrat government in Lower Saxony in 1977.
Traditionally, the federal government in Bonn, whether SPD or CDU, has tried
to push the plan along, and the state government in Hanover has resisted -
regardless of political party.
Today Mr Gerhard Schroder, the SPD premier in Hanover, insists that other
sites must be investigated - preferably in granite deposits in southern
Bavaria, the state most committed to nuclear power.
At the end of the day, the issue does not simply divide the country between
left and right, between environmentalists and the pro-industry lobby. It
also divides the country between north and south.
The northerners, including their electricity utilities, RWE and
PreussenElektra, would not mind giving up nuclear power altogether. They
could provide alternative energy from coastal power stations fired by gas or
cheap imported coal. RWE has enormous reserves of relatively cheap brown
coal.
The southerners, including the third main generator, Viag's Bayernwerk, are
far more dependent on nuclear power. They have no coastline and no cheap
imported alternatives. So they remain firmly committed to the nuclear route.
No wonder few expect an early resolution of the conflict.
The outside chance of a coalition of left-wing and environmental parties
winning the October national election would certainly mean a firm decision
to abandon nuclear energy. Ironically, because of the need to find some way
of disposing of the waste, it would probably mean a relatively swift
decision to go ahead with Gorleben, at least for interim storage.
The more likely outcome, either of a continuation of the present
conservative-liberal alliance under Chancellor Helmut Kohl, or a grand
coalition of CDU and SPD, could leave a continuing stalemate. Then both
sides will be forced to try to negotiate an energy consensus, and reconcile
their differences. What the industry fears is that any such compromise will
simply leave it in continuing uncertainty.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Telecommunications used to be regarded as a natural monopoly. A decade after
the break-up of AT&amp;T in the US and the privatisation of BT in the UK,
competition in long-distance and international telecoms is now a way of life
across much of the developed world - although not, alas, on most of
continental Europe.
Within more dynamic markets - notably the US and the UK - the debate now
focuses on the extension of competition to local telecoms. The US Congress
is grappling with legislation to abolish the local monopolies of the seven
regional Bell operators. In the UK, cable companies - mostly US-owned - are
attracting 40,000 phone subscribers a month, but the rules for future
competition with BT remain unclear.
Two questions dominate the regulatory debate on both sides of the Atlantic,
albeit in different forms. Should regulation be skewed in favour of new
entrants? And as telecoms networks are upgraded into 'superhighways'
carrying inter-active entertainment and information services, what steps
should be taken to ensure nationwide provision?
The telecommunications bill currently before the Senate would, in effect,
allow US cable operators to provide telephone services across their networks
within a year. The Baby Bells, by contrast, stand to face a lengthy
regulatory battle, in the name of universal service, before they are allowed
to compete with the cable operators. In the UK, BT is prevented by an
outright ban from competing with cable operators in domestic broadcast
entertainment services.
Both sets of restrictions are likely to disadvantage consumers, contrary to
their avowed purpose. In place of detailed universal service rules, the US
would do well to impose a UK-style regime on Bell operators wishing to
compete in cable services. In return for a franchise covering a designated
area, they would be required to offer services across the area, within a set
timescale - but would otherwise be largely free to compete. In the UK, the
government should follow the recent advice of a House of Commons committee
and announce a firm date for lifting the BT entertainment ban, so that one
monopoly is not succeeded by another as optical-fibre local networks render
existing copper wires obsolete.
Policymakers are understandably anxious that these 'superhighways' do not
become the preserve of a privileged few. Population-coverage targets and
obligations to connect public sector institutions, such as schools, are
desirable safeguards. There is also a case for uniform tariffs for basic
services, although the definition of 'basic' is problematic in the new
inter-active age.
It is important, however, that regulation does not so hamper the operators
that they delay in building the networks at all. To seek to regulate in
advance for every eventuality is a recipe for manifold regulators but
precious few services.

According to PUSH, once known simply as the Polytechnics and Universities
Students Handbook, average UK student indebtedness stands at Pounds 916 per
year, up from Pounds 614 last year.
Student debt was predictably high in London, with an average level of Pounds
1,077. But the highest level of indebtedness was in Leeds, at Pounds 1,800
per year.
In a completely unrelated finding, PUSH says the institution with the
cheapest student bar was the University of Leeds - which also happens to
have the biggest retail beer outlet in the country.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
And now, Observer proudly brings you the sentimental quango. No, not a
soft-centred version of the tango, but the Highways Agency, set up earlier
this year to take over direct responsibility for the UK government's road
building programme.
When established, the quango promised 'the best possible service to those
affected by roads'. Presumably its latest press release - four pages on the
case of Dolly Watson, 93 - is all part of that service.
Watson lives in the path of the extension to the M11 motorway, now under
construction in east London and the subject of fierce protests from
opponents - including Dolly, as the press release likes to call her.
She collapsed five days ago with a suspected mild stroke and is still in
hospital. But the agency rebuts claims that Watson has been badly treated.
It says it's appointed an officer to maintain personal contact with her; has
offered to provide a car so she can visit her replacement home; and will not
evict her while she is making visits to alternative accommodation.
If only the protesters had not prevented them, agency staff would have
explained all this personally to Dolly, says the release.
Sounds a bit like Highway Fobbery.

First the long march; then the cultural revolution; now the superloo
upheaval. China intends constructing 1,000 public conveniences at its most
famous tourist spots by 1996, in order to staunch the flow of complaints
about its equally infamous public toilets.
The State Tourism Administration and the Ministry of Construction are
jointly spending 30,000 yuan - about Dollars 3,487 - on each new loo. In
Beijing, officials have launched a city-wide Contest of Best Lavatory
Design.
Apart from good lighting and ventilation, each will also have a supervisor
to maintain cleanliness; the most diligent will stand the chance of winning
an annual reward.
'No smells of any kind will be tolerated,' says a Chinese official. That's a
relief.

Most city folk have heard of Paul Manduca who has powered through the money
management business to become boss of the Pounds 30bn Threadneedle Asset
Management group at the age of 42. And some might even have heard of his
younger brother, Francis, 30, a fund manager at Gartmore.
But another Manduca has popped up in the money management game, and, unlike
the other two, he is not a hired hand. Philip, the second youngest brother,
has set up his own hedge fund. Fresh from three years managing family money
in Palm Beach, he's started Sant Cassia Investment Management which takes
its name from his Maltese father and hopes to make its clients rich by
dabbling in exchange-traded futures and options and other exotica.
He has set up shop in Chelsea Harbour and equipped himself with a PhD in
'neural networks', a sexy computer model which apparently 'learns from its
mistakes', and a resident psychologist who analyses what 'frightens'
markets.
So what does brother Paul think of his new competitor? 'He said he hoped I
did well,' says Philip cheerfully, 'because I was using the family name and
crest'. At least he didn't call it Manduca &amp; Co.

What is it about being president of Peru that attracts the most unusual
candidates? Last time round, in 1990, there was the spectacle of an
agricultural college professor - Alberto Fujimori - slugging it out against
a novelist - Mario Vargas Llosa.
Now Javier Perez de Cuellar, former secretary-general of the United Nations,
has tossed his bonnet in the ring for the 1995 rematch, when El Chinito - as
Fujimori is affectionately if inaccurately known - is likely to stand again.
His wife, Susana Higuchi, also wants to run. First she has to overrule a
recently passed law preventing presidential spouses from competing.
At 74, you might think de Cuellar would prefer his retirement in Paris,
where he can enjoy his favourite Schubert piano sonatas in tranquillity. But
no: 'Peru is lost if nothing is done. I believe I have a duty,' said de
Cuellar recently.
What can he mean? Fujimori has presided over a magical economic turnround;
11.8 per cent growth so far this year, making Peru Latin America's most
dynamic economy. Inflation has collapsed from 1990's peak of 7,500 per cent
to a probable 20 per cent this year.
Perhaps he's thinking of Fujimori's less sparkling record when it comes to
keeping military hard men in their place. De Cuellar knows all about that
from his success first in keeping the Argentine junta out of the Falklands
in 1982, and then in persuading Saddam Hussein to pack up and walk out of
Kuwait in 1991.
Still, de Cuellar, who counts among his many honours a 1987 honorary D Ll
from the Mongolian state university, can be forgiven for sounding out of
touch; he's spent most of the past five decades anywhere but Peru.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Bank raids
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The British may fall short of the Americans in the degree of hostility they
show towards the banks, but the politics of knocking the UK financial
community is no less crude for that.
In the case of the Tories, the deed is usually done in the name of fiscal
expediency. The arbitrary levy on non-interest bearing bank deposits in 1982
was an opportunistic response to the coincidence of distressed public
finances and high banking profits. The more recent adverse change in the tax
treatment of pension fund dividend receipts came at a time of high dividend
payouts and an unprecedentedly high public sector borrowing requirement.
With Labour, populism tends to be the beginning and end of it; and it is
hard to see any broader rationale in the interest shown by the Labour shadow
chancellor, Mr Gordon Brown, in attacking bank charges. True, fee income has
gone up as the banks have sought to compensate for the decline in
profitability of their core lending business. Yet most personal customers -
and that is where the political sensitivity lies - are enjoying an
astonishingly good deal from the banks.
For the 80 per cent who do not run an overdraft, current account services,
including the hugely expensive payments system, come largely free. Not that
the banks are happy with that. Such is the competition in this area that
whenever one of the clearers tries to eliminate the cross-subsidy to
customers in credit, another can be relied on to give free-if-in-credit
banking a new lease of life. That has now extended to offering interest on
current account balances.
A more interesting question arises in the case of the minority who borrow.
Many face overdraft rates of more than 19 per cent, while the rates on small
personal loans and credit cards are well over 20 per cent. With the headline
rate of inflation down to 2.3 per cent this is a swingeing levy in real
terms. Yet attempts at price cutting by individual banks have had little
impact.
This raises interesting questions about the nature of banking competition.
Interesting, but not crude enough for the political mill. The banks behaved
insensitively in the recession; they now have a short-term bonanza; ergo,
they must be bashed. So there.

Few men, if any, have transformed their country upon attaining supreme power
at the age of 73. When the country that has been transformed is home to more
than a fifth of the world's people, the achievement is of far more than
local significance. Arguably, Deng Xiaoping's role in liberalising the
Chinese economy makes him the world's most significant political leader of
the second half of the 20th century. But his failure is on almost as grand a
scale as his successes. A yawning gulf has opened up between what, as a
Marxist, he would describe as the economic base and the political
superstructure. China's future, perhaps even the world's, depends on
whether, and how, that gulf is closed.
Mao Zedong would be at the head of any list of history's ideological
fanatics. Deng, with his insistence on the need to seek truth from facts, is
the supreme pragmatist. His invention of 'socialism with Chinese
characteristics' was a stroke of genius. He knew that the capitalist rose
could smell as sweet under a socialist label. What mattered to him was not
ideological consistency, but unleashing the talent and drive of the Chinese
people.
Under Deng, the market has been brought into China, while China has erupted
on to the global economy. Between 1977 and 1993, China's measured gross
domestic product rose more than fourfold; the dollar value of its exports
increased tenfold; and the annual inflow of direct investment rose from
virtually nothing to Dollars 26bn. Above all, hundreds of millions have
experienced a transformation in how they live now, and how they hope to live
tomorrow.
China's economic success has also transformed what the economic development
of east Asia, hitherto confined to relatively small countries, signifies for
the world as whole. This is no longer just another change in the
distribution of global economic activity. It heralds the end of roughly half
a millennium of European dominance. The 21st century will, it is said, be
the Pacific century. More probably, it will be China's century.
The question is what sort of China this will be. A price has had to be paid
for Deng's pragmatism, just as a far greater one had to be paid for Mao's
fanaticism. He has let sleeping political dogs lie. But whenever they wake,
they bite. The price includes a party without its ideological raison d'etre;
a society without the rule of law; and a political system without checks and
balances. The massacre in Tiananmen Square is a black mark against Deng's
name. It was a sign of panic. But it was a sign, too, of his failure to
adapt the political system to the changes brought about by China's economic
success.
It may be that Deng had, in truth, no realistic choice. He is, to his
credit, no arbitrary despot prepared, like a Mao or a Stalin, to butcher his
opponents in millions. He wooed the Communist party, which they cowed. But
this failure to secure political reform, or even a credible successor,
leaves his legacy vulnerable to chaos, or reversal.
The probability, in fact, is that those policies will not be reversed. To do
so would require determination and bloodshed on a horrifying scale. Chaos is
understandably feared by the Chinese. But the problem is as likely to be a
different one: the arrival on the world stage of a giant economic power that
is also an arbitrary, often a xenophobic, despotism. Grim for the Chinese,
this would be fearful for everyone else. Deng, 90 yesterday, has clearly
failed to rise to the challenge of political reform. For China's sake, as
well as that of the rest of the world, his successors must not fail too.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: How to steer round both road tolls
and evaders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From J M REYNOLDS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, How lucky Mr Harley is to live in such a generous country as
Switzerland (Letters, August 17).
I do not believe that the majority of sensibly minded motorway users in the
UK would 'rebel' over paying Pounds 15 a year, or defect to the side roads.
But when figures of 1.5p per motorway mile are bandied around, that could
make things different.
In my own case, Pounds 15 would give me about 11 days' motorway use at 1.5
pence per mile. At a rough calculation, my annual motorway bill would be
about Pounds 250 at the above rate.
With regard to any additional revenue required being added to the fuel cost
then being lost in the 'Treasury maw', what is to stop them 'losing' the
motorway tolls?
A fairer system would be to abolish completely the Road Fund Licence, and
put everything on to fuel. This would achieve the dual aim of making the
user pay for road use, whether it is a motorway or otherwise, and making the
tax evader a person of the past. But that is a whole different can of worms.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Irish reunification costly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL BARRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Ian Davidson, in his article 'Ballot box blarney' (August 17), makes,
what is to me, one of the classic errors in summarising the current
situation regarding Northern Ireland and its constitutional position within
the UK.
Your writer refers to recent statements by Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn
Fein; he outlines difficulties for the terrorists on both sides; he restates
comments made by the British government; he reflects on the demographic
changes taking place between the Catholics and the Protestants in the
province; he refers to the Spanish and French governments by way of a
comparison to illustrate his opinion of the present position. Not once does
he consider the views of the people of Eire.
I have family and friends south of the border, and in a very unsophisticated
survey I found that the majority of my contacts would prefer there to be no
reunification with Ulster.
This is not out of any lack of nationalistic pride, but from the practical
belief that Eire cannot afford to take on the cost of integrating the North.
The feeling is that Eire is not a West Germany or even a South Korea. Their
hearts may be for it, but it is an open question as to whether their wallets
and purses are as enthusiastic.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Better return for taxpayers from
in-house consultants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BARRY A REAMSBOTTOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Sir Peter Levene fears I misunderstand both the Efficiency Unit
scrutiny report on external consultants and the recent white paper on the
civil service (Letters, August 13). His fear is unfounded: I understand them
only too well.
I am disturbed that Sir Peter, the prime minister's adviser on efficiency,
does not recommend that, rather than spend Pounds 508m on external
consultants, the government might get a better return for taxpayers' money
by developing and supporting an in-house civil service expertise. And I am
fairly certain the bill for that would come in at far less than Pounds 508m.
Sir Peter seems also to have developed an aversion to the term 'market
testing', preferring 'competing for quality', a process that he claims 20
per cent-plus savings for.
The government has yet to establish how quality is to be maintained once
work goes outside the civil service to a private contractor, but it has yet
to take up my union's challenge to substantiate these claimed savings.
The simple fact of the matter is that in the past two years 'market testing'
has run up consultancy costs alone of Pounds 39m, never mind the costs of
setting up MT units in each department and agency and the cost of failed or
abandoned market tests.
And John Major, his efficiency adviser, Sir Peter Levene, William
Waldegrave, until the reshuffle the minister for market testing, et al have
yet to produce detailed evidence to back up their claim of Pounds 135m saved
by market testing.
They avoid being pinned down by pleading either 'commercial in confidence'
or that the work in detailing the savings figures would be disproportionate.
Sir Peter also omits to mention that his competing for quality programme is
rather selective.
After lots of pressure from the private sector, which keeps bleating about a
non-level playing field, Sir Peter's Efficiency Unit has prevented the
in-house civil service teams from playing at all - almost Pounds 770m worth
of central government work has been market tested without civil servants
being allowed to compete for the contracts]
Joy for the private sector but certainly not value for money for the
taxpayer.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Personal View: Peg is no panacea for hyper-inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHAILENDRA J. ANJARIA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There has been much discussion lately of how effective a pegged ex-change
rate can be in stabilising the value of a currency (Financial Times,
Economic Viewpoint: 'No going back to Bretton Woods', July 28).
Pegged rates can help with stabilisation and have been central components of
anti-inflation strategies in many instances, but they cannot do it alone;
the right supporting conditions are also necessary.
Such conditions cannot be assumed automatically to accompany the adoption of
a fixed-rate regime. This is why the record of such regimes, such as the
many stabilisation plans in Latin America and elsewhere, in the 1980s and
1990s includes failures as well as successes.
At the same time, successful stabilisation has been achieved without pegging
the exchange rate. It is important to review the lessons from such diverse
experiences, several of which are discussed in the May 1994 edition of the
IMF's World Economic Outlook.
Strict financial discipline is critical for successful stabilisation, with
or without a pegged exchange rate. Large fiscal and quasi-fiscal deficits
are a fundamental driving force behind the excessive monetary expansion that
sustains high inflation. In high-inflation countries, attempts to stabilise
prices without attacking the fiscal deficits have, at best, only temporarily
succeeded.
To be sure, pegging the exchange rate can encourage financial discipline,
but this effect should not be exaggerated.
The costs of failure under a pegged regime are high. Fiscally unsound
programmes that have relied on a fixed exchange rate - and, in many
instances, on incomes policies as well - have achieved only a temporary
reduction in inflation. When such programmes eventually fail, inflation
comes back with a vengeance.
During the second half of the 1980s, for example, Argentina and Brazil went
through a succession of failed exchange-rate-based programmes, with
inflation reaching a higher plateau after each failure. Failed programmes,
whether exchange-rate-based or not, erode the credibility of future
stabilisation efforts, increase the public debt, may have a high cost in
terms of international reserve losses, and increase the difficulty of
eventually attaining stabilisation.
Using the exchange rate as the nominal anchor has been most successful
against hyper-inflation - when rigidities in domestic prices and wages and
backward-looking indexation usually disappear. Most prices are quoted in
foreign currency. Hence, fixing the exchange rate can immediately stabilise
prices in domestic currency. This explains why in most successful
stabilisations inflation has come down virtually overnight.
An important problem, however, is fixing the exchange rate at the right
level, a particularly difficult task in economies in transition or others
with widespread price distortions. If the rate is fixed at too high a level,
competitiveness in foreign trade may be sacrificed and, with it, confidence
in the currency. If the rate is too low, far from reining in inflation it
may give it an additional boost.
Pegged exchange rates have also been successful in stabilising economies
with a history of high, but relatively stable, inflation. However, in these
cases widespread indexation in goods and financial markets imparts a high
degree of inertia to inflation.
Fixing either the level or the rate of change of the exchange rate does not
usually have an immediate effect on inflation, thus leading to real
appreciation and often unsustainable trade deficits. Therefore, incomes
policies have sometimes been used to break the wage-price spiral, as in the
successful Mexican and Israeli plans, and in Argentina structural reforms
such as the elimination of indexation were used.
Currency stabilisation may occur even without a sizeable cushion of reserves
or abundant official foreign financing. External financing may be important
as a signal of international support, not least in helping to make
stabilisation packages politically feasible.
In some cases, a sizeable reserve cushion has also been useful in
reinforcing the credibility of the peg. However, experience shows, most
recently in Argentina, that large amounts of official foreign financing are
not strictly essential to support an exchange rate peg when the domestic
financial situation is brought under control. Also, countries such as
Bolivia and Peru floated their currencies and were able to maintain currency
stability without major official external financing. The potential for
private capital inflows may in any case overshadow the need for official
financing.
What the past teaches us is that an exchange rate anchor is considerably
less than a panacea for stabilisation, though the IMF has appropriately
supported its use as part of a credible policy package in, for example, the
former Czechoslovakia, Estonia and Poland.
But if the other conditions for currency stabilisation, especially fiscal
consolidation, are not met, an exchange rate anchor will fail, and may make
the outcome worse than if it had never been introduced.
Its main use is in enhancing the credibility of an otherwise viable policy
package, especially in hyper-inflationary conditions, though even with such
a package it may be useful, but not necessary.
For this reason, the IMF takes a pragmatic view of pegged exchange rates,
considering their use as but one possible tool in recommending an
appropriate policy package to help members reduce inflation and restore the
value of, and confidence in, their currencies.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Tax on paper gains would be
self-defeating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From C E CHAMBERLAIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a specialist adviser on executive share options, including a number
of water and regional electricity companies, I was interested to read Mr
Gordon Brown's comments that 'options were costing the taxpayer Pounds 200m
per year in lost tax revenue' ('Labour names share option 'millionaires' ',
August 19). I wonder if this is all it seems.
Most taxpayers expect to pay tax when they receive cash. However, under Mr
Brown's proposals, executives will pay tax when they simply convert their
options into shares, ie swap one piece of paper into another without any
cash being received.
As it happens, most executives do sell most of their new holding of shares
almost immediately. As a result, they pay much the same amount of tax as if
they had paid tax on the paper gains rather than their cash gains.
The only difference is the relatively small annual capital gains tax
exemption, which they can employ to reduce their gains.
Possibly, some of Mr Brown's lost taxes can be recovered by withdrawing the
annual capital gains tax exemption on option gains by treating them as
income. If so, then the burden will fall disproportionately on the lower
reaches of employees rather than Mr Brown's 'millionaire optionholders'. The
loss of a Pounds 5,800 exemption to an ordinary employee means a great deal
more than to a millionaire option-holder.
The only way Mr Brown could raise a significant proportion of the alleged
Pounds 200m lost tax he has identified is to tax the paper gains at sharply
higher rates than the present 40 per cent.
Curiously, even this may be counter-productive. If employees are taxed on
their paper gains rather than cash gains, then the options may appear less
of an incentive and companies would presumably offer the benefit of share
options less regularly or, more likely, only to a restricted circle of
senior executives who are better placed to cope with the more complicated
tax liabilities.
In any event, the end result would probably be that the total amount of tax
revenues raised on share options would probably dwindle, not increase.

FT  23 AUG 94 / How to make the most of life: A look at an attempt in the UK
financial services industry to meet customer needs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The warning on the life insurance policy was written, with suitable
severity, in block capitals. Key words were underlined. The gist was simple:
if you do not like our terms for surrendering policies early, too bad.
That was 60 years ago. Mr John Hylands, head of marketing at Standard Life
(not the company cited above), says: 'Then people who left early had 'broken
their contract', and received what the life company out of the kindness of
its heart decided to shell out.
'No one today would take that line, it's not viable any more.' Instead,
companies try harder to find ways of keeping their customers.
The change of attitude is one example of a trend by life companies towards
creating financial services products that better suit the customer.
'We have moved away from the paternalism of the old days, when a chief
actuary would come up with a policy which he thought would be good for
people, and then the sales force went out and sold it,' one chief executive
comments. 'Now we try to respond to what the customer wants.'
Designing products that suit people appears so obvious a marketing strategy
that its relative novelty seems surprising. Executives say one reason why it
has taken so long to come about is the complexity of many financial
products, which makes them difficult to devise and often confusing for the
customers.
But now change is being forced on the industry. Consumers are becoming more
sophisticated - and increasingly wary of an industry with a reputation for
hard selling policies which may be inappropriate for customers.
Demand for life insurance products where the customer pays regular premiums
 -currently the biggest part of the market - is falling. Income from such
policies fell from Pounds 2.04bn in 1991 to Pounds 1.75bn last year. In
1991, some 5.77m regular premium policies were taken out; by 1993 that had
fallen to 4.46m.
At the same time, new standards are being set by the industry's regulators.
From next January, the Personal Investment Authority, which protects the
private investor, will insist life companies give customers more information
about the costs of selling a life policy and the commission paid to
advisers.
Life companies are responding to these regulatory and demand pressures in
two ways. First, they are making their products more flexible. Sun Alliance,
the large life insurer, earlier this year launched a life policy under which
the cover provided can be varied. For instance, a customer could make
provision for a bigger payout while he has dependent children and then
reduce the cover when they have grown up. Premiums vary accordingly - or
could be varied anyway, according to the customers' financial circumstances
over time.
Second, as part of the move towards greater flexibility and transparency,
life companies are starting to split - or 'unbundle' - the two parts of a
life policy: the 'protection' part which pays out on death or serious
injury; and the investment part which pays out a lump sum when the policy
expires.
Earlier this year, for example, Prudential Corporation, the UK's largest
life insurer, launched two policies: Prudence Family Cover and the Prudence
Savings Account - which split the insurance and savings elements
respectively of a conventional product. Under the scheme, the proportion of
'protection' to 'savings' can be decided by the customer
Several other companies plan to launch similarly flexible products in the
autumn and beyond. 'There is a whole trend towards more flexible and complex
products,' says Mr Philip Scott, Norwich Union life and pensions general
manager.
The trend towards greater product flexibility and unbundling have been
welcomed by the Consumers' Association. Ms Jean Eaglesham, the association's
financial specialist, says for 'too long life companies have been able to
get away with selling packaged products' when a more flexible approach may
have benefited customers.
But the trend offers the life companies an important advantage as well: a
means of combating increasing competition from other forms of long-term
savings. By offering customised policies, life companies should be able to
compete more effectively with, for instance, unit trusts or deposit
accounts.
In an uncertain economic climate, in which customers are reluctant to make
long-term commitments because of fears of job or wage cuts, such flexibility
is in increasing demand. This has been shown by the fact that in recent
years the number of regular premium policies sold has fallen while sales of
single-premium polices have risen.
Another advantage for the life companies is that greater flexibility in
premium payments should mean fewer customers giving up their policies early.
This has been a particular problem for the past couple of years: on one
industry expert's estimate, 23 per cent of life policies are surrendered at
the end of the first year.
A lapsed policy not only means a lost income stream for the company, it may
also mean an upset customer who will not buy the company's products again.
Moreover, the high lapse rate draws attention to the relatively low
surrender value of many life policies, attracting further damaging
publicity. Life companies were forced on to the defensive in June by a
report from the Office of Fair Trading showing that some savings plans
offered very poor surrender values.
While economic circumstances and the problems of the life industry mean
companies have little option but to move quickly towards offering greater
flexibility, there are drawbacks.
The main problem for the companies is likely to be lower margins. As
consumers become aware of the policy charges, competition will intensify,
even if the volume of business expands. 'Industry margins will be under
terrific pressure over the next few years,' says Mr Stephen Maran, chief
executive of Lloyds Abbey Life, the life insurance company.
Unbundling products holds specific dangers. As the split between protection
and investment becomes more common, protection-only policies could be
treated like motor insurance, with quotes available by the telephone. By
putting greater emphasis on price, this would add to the pressure on
margins.
At the same time, the investment plans would have to compete more directly
with other forms of savings - for instance Personal Equity Plans - offered
by other financial institutions such as banks and building societies.
Some life companies also warn that a general move towards unbundling may not
necessarily benefit the consumer. They argue that buying protection
separately over the telephone would mark a departure from the approach to
selling financial services urged by the Personal Investment Authority, and
its parent regulator the Securities and Investments Board. The two
regulators say that sales representatives should take account of a
customer's overall financial needs if they are to offer sensible financial
planning advice.
Though Ms Eaglesham of the Consumers' Association thinks the life companies
are protesting too much, she agrees there is a risk to consumers in
separating the components of life policies. The answer, she says, is to
bring protection-only policies within the remit of the Personal Investment
Authority.
The industry would argue against such an extension of regulatory controls -
particularly given that the trend towards greater flexibility has only just
begun to gather pace. It will not be clear until figures are released next
year whether the life industry is selling more policies as a result of the
shift. But one point is already clear: making life simpler for the customer
does not make life easier for insurers.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Arts: Russian recitals - Edinburgh Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When relations with Gorbachev's Soviet Union started to warm, the Edinburgh
Festival was quick to fill its programmes with the country's finest opera
companies. In the last couple of years we have regrettably seen less of
them, but the link remains and a couple of recitals this year have reminded
us of what we are missing.
Even the great Russian bear only disgorges a voice like Galina Gorchakova's
once in a generation. In arias by Verdi and Puccini at the Queen's Hall she
let fly with singing of a vocal intensity that sent shivers down one's back,
sometimes covering the voice to produce a black thunder-cloud of a sound,
more often driving it straight ahead with searing ferocity. Here at last is
a worthy successor to the inimitable Galina Vishnevskaya.
Those, however, were just the encores at her morning recital on Friday. The
intimacy of the hall demands songs rather than blazing operatic arias and
Gorchakova's programme had been a broad selection of Russian composers,
including Glinka, Dargomyzhsky, Balakirev and Rimsky-Korsakov - a brave
choice, both for the unfamiliarity of the songs and because she was tackling
inward-looking music that cannot be second nature to her.
Restricted to drawing-room good manners, the voice behaves itself
surprisingly well. Occasionally the pitch slipped just below the note when
she was fining away the ends of quiet phrases, but the scale of the singing
always made sense. Gorchakova is doubly fortunate that her soprano sounds as
alive when she is singing softly as it does at full throttle.
As a song interpreter, she seizes upon any opportunity to dramatise.
Rachmaninov's vivid picture of a lonely poet gripped by panic in the black
of night became a tense, first-hand experience. In Tchaikovsky's 'Do not
believe, my friend' the passion of the central section was made to contrast
strikingly with the down-hearted sorrow on either side.
At her unforgettable recital at the 1992 festival Olga Borodina gave us a
very different Tchaikovsky. These two singers are among the new stars of the
Maryinsky Opera, which is entering a golden period under the artistic
directorship of Valery Gergiev. They both use the services of his sister,
Larissa Gergieva, as accompanist, but that does not mean that their singing
comes out the same. It was fascinating to hear Gergieva making Tchaikovsky's
'Lullaby' so light and airy for Gorchakova, when it had been heavy with
presentiment of danger for Borodina two years before.
The mezzo returned this year to give her own Queen's Hall morning recital a
couple of days earlier. (Gorchakova was in the audience, a sign of the
Maryinsky's close company spirit.) She began in what I can best describe as
11-o'-clock-in-the-morning voice, not yet able to make phrases flow easily
one into another. But once into her stride, she showed again (if briefly)
why she has to be ranked one of the leading recitalists of today.
There were just three Rachmaninov songs that touched greatness. What makes
Borodina so special is her ability to create for a song a sound world of its
own: 'How fair this place' a luminous, out-of-doors radiance; 'Oh, do not
grieve' plumbing the darkest shadows of her deep mezzo; and 'Lilacs' brushed
with soft pastel shades. Every song becomes an individual statement to be
savoured and Borodina takes her time summoning her concentration for each in
turn.
The second half was cleverly planned to lead from a strong performance of
Shostakovich's Spanish Songs to the real thing in Falla's Seven Spanish
Folksongs. But the Mediterranean spontaneity of the Falla is foreign to
Borodina's deeply thought-out singing and the cycle failed to take off. Her
heart lies in St. Petersburg, a city which is proving to be the cradle of
Russian singing for a whole new generation.

There is a hearties/aesthetes split this evening which will be irritating
for some. Apart from EastEnders and the news, BBC1 is devoted entirely to
the Commonwealth Games starting at 7.00 and continuing until 1.30 in the
morning. Scheduled events include the men's and women's 100 metres, with
Linford Christie looking for yet another victory, the men's and women's 3000
metres, men's and women's 400 metres, and the men's 110 metres hurdles which
will presumably be won by Colin Jackson. Channel 4, however, offers an
interesting competitive attraction. After Episode 2 in their repeat of
Lipstick On Your Collar (10.00) which was not the best series ever created
by the late Dennis Potter, they offer the first full length showing on
television of Potter's 1993 Edinburgh Festival lecture (11.10). This was the
occasion when he attacked the BBC's top men, Duke Hussey and John Birt, whom
he called 'croak-voiced Daleks', and Rupert Murdoch whose very name stuck in
his throat. On the occasion of the 90th birthday of China's aged leader Deng
Xiaoping Julian O'Halloran provides a profile on BBC2 (9.30).

FT  23 AUG 94 / Arts: Superb cast for Rossini's 'Semiramide' - David Murray
finds singing ranging from the excellent to the electrifying in De Ana's
production at the Pesaro festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At Pesaro, the Rossini Opera Festival sprang into full glory on Sunday with
a Semiramide of unusual breadth and much splendour. Where Dario Fo's
exuberant version of the 'dramma giocoso' L'Italiana in Algeri was adorned
by its sopranos but slightly foxed by another singer or two, Hugo De Ana's
grand staging of the uncut 'melodramma tragico' provides an arena for
Rossini singing that ranges from the excellent to the electrifying.
Aficionados with money and leisure might note that it is repeated tonight,
Thursday and Sunday. On the first night in the Palazzo del Sport - re-named
the 'Palafestival' for the occasion - the house was large but not quite
full. The production is a revival from two years back, after all, though
with almost entirely new personnel, and not counting the interval,
Semiramide takes about four hours uncut: not a prospect to be viewed
lightly.
This time it can be viewed with excited anticipation. Semiramide was the
last opera Rossini wrote in Italy, and the one for which he stretched his
'conservative' skills to sumptuous limits. It is a grandiose model of
symmetry and balance, despite its shocking events - near-incest, betrayal
and murder. In the interests of both economy and its most striking vocal
episodes, it is usually trimmed hard; but Philip Gossett and Alberto Zedda,
the Fondazione Rossini editors, would argue that nothing less than the
complete score can reveal Rossini's mastery of the largest scale.
The essential thing is to have the right singers, who must nowadays be
near-freakish in their command of early 19th-century technique and feeling.
Rossini's long, leisurely periods need and expect spectacular vocal display
as highlights, no less to illuminate the drama than to show off star voices.
At Pesaro we have it all. Roger Norrington conducts the Stuttgart Radio
Symphony vitally as well as stylishly: he finds a musical thrust even in
passages which might seem datedly conventional, and with his tingling
support his star singers rise to great heights.
The plot of Semiramide is a twisted echo of the Agamemnon story. Semiramide
is the Clytemnestra-figure, Assur her guilty partner in uxoricide, young
Arsace (a breeches-role) the new Orestes who comes both to avenge his father
Nino - whose ghostly utterances are formidably delivered by Riccardo Ferrari
 -and to risk succumbing unawares to his mother. None of this has the
unsentimental clarity of the Greeks; on the contrary, the principals express
themselves in wild bravura roulades, such as only deep-dyed Rossinians can
deliver with conviction.
Cecilia Gasdia, a great Pesaro regular, does that as Semiramide.
White-faced, greedy-fingered and at last desperate, she passes from elegant
calculation to full-cry despair, and her nuances in all these fireworks
command our sympathy and amazement. Arsace and his cruel fate are incarnated
by Martine Dupuy with an extraordinary range of vocal colour, from
submissive sweetness to hackle-grabbing eruptions.
The third member of a memorable trio is the American Rockwell Blake as the
extraneous character Idreno, who vainly loves the extraneous Azema (Ornella
Bonomelli, modestly warm and charming). By modern standards, Idreno gets
some of Rossini's most impossibly virtuoso tenor-writing; Blake is dry-ish
but clean and glisteningly metallic, with swift, mercurial, dazzlingly
accurate flashes. Can any other modern tenor come close to that? Less
spectacular but soundly committed, the Assur of the baritone Michele Pertusi
(sole survivor, I think, from the 1992 cast) grows powerfully toward his
last tortured moments.
De Ana's production is sharper by a long way than his recent Rossini for
Covent Garden, Mose in Egitto. There, handsome tableaux were dully
compromised by flaccid dramatic effects; here, his aesthetic contrivances
for the choruses - especially all the photogenic stuff with spears -
reinforce the tense relations between the 'heroes' but leave them to get on
with them in nakedly personal style. De Ana takes fullest advantage of the
P. del S's reach, the better to emphasise the lonely centrality of the
principals.
Warmly if extravagantly recommended, then, to those with a devoted interest
in Rossini's opere serie. The night before we had his Stabat Mater recreated
almost as potently by Gianluigi Gelmetti with the same orchestra, choruses
from Prague and Warsaw and two passionate soloists. The soprano Anna
Caterina Antonacci and the warm, faultlessly intelligent bass Roberto
Scandiuzzi carried all before them. The others  - tenor Marcello Giordani
and contralto Gloria Scalchi - were just routinely lusty; but we heard
enough to be persuaded that Rossini's 'conservative' Italian idiom rewards
any amount of attention.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Arts: Layers of Impressionism - Never mind the strategies,
the pictures are fine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Monet to Matisse is one of those curious but not unrewarding shows that adds
up to a little less than the sum of its parts. The National Gallery of
Scotland's 1970s extension is a poky warren of a place, but it does put a
natural limit to any exhibition, forcing a disciplined choice upon its
curator and keeping it to a blessedly digestible size. In this case the
installation may be fussy and intrusive but, in the face of the works
themselves, it is easy enough to ignore.
The trawl made by Richard Thomson through public and private collections
around the world, most especially through the provincial museums of France,
has yielded an exceptionally rich haul of beautiful and often unfamiliar
things. He has taken them to serve his theoretical purpose: we, for our
part, may relish them for themselves, and we thank him for that.
The main title is a shade misleading, for there is more to it than the
narrow impressionist-to-post-impressionist line. Rather, in beginning around
1874, the year of the first Impressionist Exhibition and the coining of the
eponymous epithet itself, and running on until the outbreak of the first
world war, it takes landscape painting in its period in its broadest aspect,
from Corot to Bonnard. Here are Salon painters such as Sege and Ponson,
social realists such as Cazin and Martin, mystics and symbolists such as
Puvis de Chavannes and Moreau, and many minor or neglected figures besides,
such as Valloton, le Sidaner, Roussel and Guillemet, to set beside the great
names from Monet to Picasso, Cezanne to Matisse.
Furthermore, by taking certain themes or approaches turn by turn - the
Suburbs of Paris; the Channel Coast; the Mediterranean; the Ideal; Vision
and Metamorphosis; and so on - the conventional chronology is overthrown by
the inevitable over-lappings and comparisons. Early and late, simultaneity
is all, making the fundamental art-historical point that artists of all
kinds go on producing serious and significant work long after another
generation has come in, another ism taken over.
Some of these groups are wonderfully strong - the paintings of Notre Dame by
Matisse, Marquet and Segonzac, for example; haystacks by Gauguin, Monet and
Van Gogh; two pastoral idylls - one by Roussel, of lovers beneath a tree,
the other by Picasso, in his run-up to Cubism - of single figures similarly
disposed. So it goes on, with painting after painting memorable for itself -
Bonnard's railway train puffing one way, his barge the other; Valloton's
terrified Pentheus fleeing the furies across the dark green hillside;
Renoir's sunlit rocks and bushes at l'Estaque; le Sidaner's town square;
Seurat's Gravelines; Monet's le Havre water-front, his ice breaking up at
Vetheuil, his boatyard on the Seine . . .
Only when we come to the rationale do we hit trouble. Having brought such
lovely things together, Dr Thomson then seems to suggest that their physical
and painterly qualities as works of art are not really the point at all.
What fascinates him is their documentary interest in the social and economic
context of the times. 'After 1870', he writes in his catalogue, 'pressing
public debate about suburban expansion brought the issue into the artist's
focus. The suburban motif was perhaps of all landscapes the one most
quintessentially modern, and the painter had to confront (sic) and find
forms for change.'
Monet moved to Argenteuil in the 1870s and the paintings he made there, Dr
Thomson continues, 'can be read as images of national reconstruction after
the Franco-Prussian War . . . a picture of leisure along the suburban Seine
could . . . be taken to imply prosperity and stability regained . . . In one
painting of 1873, he adopted a distinctly layered composition . . . first a
rank of saplings marking the end of the meadow . . . next a line of newly
erected houses, then a bank of well-established trees, and finally the
medieval spire . . . a visual classification in which is inherent the notion
of past, present and future: the perfect pictorial structuring . . . of
suburban flux. It was a strategy shared with other artists.'
The snag with these distinct layers, classifications, inherent notions,
pictorial structures and strategies is that they relate only to Dr Thomson's
own interests and readings of the work. Social developments do, of course,
affect artists directly, and it is certainly true that the recent
development of the railways had made the Parisian hinterland, indeed the
Mediterranean, more readily accessible to them. If a particular landscape
appealed, it did so for incidental and formal reasons acknowledged more by
intuition than any conscious analysis. And if a factory chimney was there
instead of a church spire, or a railway rather than an old road, so be it.
The mistake lies only in the ascription of motives or, as Dr Thomson would
say, strategies, that were never there. The pictures are fine.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Technology: Drugs prices pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies that pioneer new pharmaceutical products are being caught up much
more quickly by their competitors than in previous years, according to a
report* by Datamonitor.
To try to offset this declining exclusivity, they are developing drugs more
quickly. Zeneca of the UK, for example, is consistently achieving its target
of administering drugs to human volunteers within 14 months of synthesis,
compared with 30 months previously.
In the days when there was more time before the arrival of 'me-too'
products, SmithKline Beecham's anti-ulcer drug Tagamet was on the market for
eight years before the launch of Glaxo's Zantac. But Glaxo's anti-nausea
compound Zofran was on the market for only a year before SmithKline Beecham
launched its rival Kytril.
The increased competition has put more rapid pressure on prices, says
Datamonitor, which expects only sluggish volume growth in the market for the
rest of this decade.
This pressure will be accentuated by increased exposure to non-patented
generic competition. By December 1997, there will be Dollars 10bn (Pounds
6.4bn) worth of sales within the portfolios of 14 US pharmaceuticals
companies subject to generic competition.
More than half the top 50 drugs in the US will lose patent protection over
the next four years.
Prices can fall as much as 70 per cent within 18 months of patent expiry.
Those categories most exposed to generic competition are anti-
hypertensives, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories for arthritis and pain;
anxiolytics; and B-2 stimulants for asthma.
Companies will try to offset patent expiries, when they can, by launching
over-the-counter, non-prescription versions.

FT  23 AUG 94 / People: Swan's Marsh joins Babcock
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Alex Marsh, 48, a former chief executive of Swan Hunter, the troubled
Tyneside shipbuilder, is joining Babcock International to help prepare its
bid for the Rosyth Royal Dockyard which is to be sold off by the government.
Marsh, who led the Pounds 5m management buy-out from British Shipbuilders in
1986, lost his job at Swan Hunter some months ago but had been acting as a
consultant to Price Waterhouse, which was called in as the shipyard's
receivers in May 1993.
Swan Hunter, which used to be the UK's leading builder of surface warships,
is faced with closure if the receivers cannot find a buyer. The yard's
workforce has fallen from 8,300 ten years ago to about 600 and time is
running out. The receiver has threatened to axe the firm's design and
technical team at the end of the month and, if this goes, the prospects of
being able to bid for new work disappear.
France's Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie is the only company to show
any interest in rescuing Swan but its willingness to take over the yard is
dependent on Swan's winning new work. Ironically, one of the last chances
Swan had to win new business, the refit of the Royal Navy's landing ship Sir
Bedivere, went to Babcock's Rosyth yard last month.
Babcock International has also been going through a rough patch. It lost
Pounds 41.2m in its last financial year and its facilities management
division, which manages Rosyth for the Ministry of Defence, is the most
profitable part of its business. It contributed Pounds 10.5m last year but
Babcock's management contract expires in April 1996 and the company has to
plan how to respond to the government's decision to sell Rosyth.
Babcock's new chairman John Parker is a former deputy chief executive of
British Shipbuilders and his decision to bring in Marsh, another ex-British
Shipbuilders' executive, will be seen as evidence of Babcock's commitment to
hang on to its Rosyth business. Marsh joins at the end of the month as
marketing and strategic director of Babcock's facilities management
division.

Per Olof Loof (above), appointed to head AT&amp;T Istel, the European data
communications and systems integration subsidiary of the US telecoms giant,
is the third of AT&amp;T Europe's recent recruits to be poached from Digital.
In February, AT&amp;T appointed Pier Carlo Falotti, Digital's former European
head, as its first European chief executive. Loof, 43, Digital's European
sales and marketing vice-president, transfers to Redditch-based AT&amp;T Istel
on Falotti's coat-tails.
With 3,000 employees, Istel is AT&amp;T's largest European venture. AT&amp;T's
European strategy remains unclear, but its deal last month with Unisource,
the joint venture between the Dutch, Swedish, Swiss and Spanish national
telecoms operators, underlines its commitment to the European market, and
data communications will be critical to any European advance by AT&amp;T.
Loof's experience promoting Digital in the financial services sector will be
especially useful at Istel. Before Digital he was at Arthur Anderson, in
Sweden and the US.
Peter Teague, Istel's current chief executive, moves to become vice
president and chief financial officer of AT&amp;T UK, which is expanding after
gaining a draft UK telecoms licence last month.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Technology: Virtual repairs for hole in the road - Welsh
Water is using interactive systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID TRAHERNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A public utility in the UK will use virtual reality for the first time this
year to show customers why a busy road must be closed and dug up.
Welsh Water, the privatised water company, will use a personal
computer-based interactive virtual reality system at public meetings in
Wrexham, north Wales, to show the public how a sewerage rehabilitation
scheme will affect the local community.
The system will replace 'costly' and 'less flexible' rigid models of the
proposed work.
In addition to the PC-based interactive system, Welsh Water plans to make a
'textured' version available on video, which uses photographs of the actual
buildings in the affected street to make the scene more realistic, created
on a RealityEngine from the US-based Silicon Graphics.
Much of the research for the project has been carried out by Intelligent
Systems Solutions, based in Salford. The company has been working with NW
Barber Group, a civil engineering consultancy based in Cheshire, which hopes
the money-saving technique of creating virtual environments on PCs then
sending them to higher level machines for texturing will attract a broad
customer base.
Roger Moore, planning manager with Welsh Water, says that illustrating the
disruption caused by sewerage work is particularly important because sewers
are usually deeper and larger than other services. As a result, the
disturbance during rehabilitation work is considerable.
The public will be able to 'fly' along 600m of street affected by the work
stopping outside their own virtual house or business. It will also be
possible to 'fly' down to the decaying sewerage system.
Clicking on icons in the virtual pavement will activate a real-time video of
the sewer. And the effects of a sewer overflow will also be shown. 'Our
customers will be able to evaluate the extent of the proposed excavation and
use the system to make changes,' says Moore.
To keep costs down, most of the work to create the virtual world is being
done on PCs. But the graphics are not as good as those on more expensive
higher level machines so the information is sent from one to the other.
'The graphics and hierarchical structure of something with the complexity of
the real world is ported from the PC to a RealityEngine where it is rendered
using photographs of the real world as well as geometrical objects,'
explains Andy Connell, lead virtual reality researcher at Intelligent
Systems Solutions.
These techniques mean 'Pounds 1,000 platforms do 90 per cent of the job,
making the work affordable to companies like NW Barber,' he adds.
To create the virtual world for Welsh Water, Intelligent Systems is using
Ordnance Survey information of the local area to form the backdrop above
ground. Individual elements such as virtual houses, business premises, road
machinery and street furniture (telephone boxes, road cones and street
signs) are stored in a library on a PC before being called up to build the
virtual street.
If the demonstration is successful, Moore believes it could help raise the
profile of public consultation meetings which are 'sometimes greeted with
total apathy'. The public, he says, is often unimpressed and confused by
plan drawings provided by consultants. They can in some cases be hard to
interpret, he adds.
'The use of virtual reality will bring clarity to our presentation and best
explain to our customers how the work will impact on the local community.'
Dave Walters, associate in research and technological development at NW
Barber, says other water companies are now exploring uses for the virtual
reality system.
South West Water plans to use a similar technique to illustrate why it needs
to dig up parts of a road close to an ancient monument - Exeter Cathedral.
Thames Water is considering ways the system might be used to show how a new
sewerage pumping station in south-east London, will blend with its
surroundings.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Technology: The next smart move - The payment card's
magnetic stripe will be ousted by the more highly evolved single chip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The magnetic stripe on payment cards is moving further up the list of
endangered species.
Though it will be some years before it finally becomes extinct, progress in
developing 'chip' or integrated circuit technology for cards means that its
demise is approaching.
It may be a couple of years before a single-chip card can operate across
borders or at a great number of outlets internationally. But after five to
10 years of parallel technology, cash dispensers and point-of-sale
terminals, the natural habitat of payment cards' magnetic stripe, will have
changed to suit only the more highly evolved 'smart' card.
'The more complex the card, the more complex the point-of-sale needs to be,'
says Jean-Jacques Desbons, president and chief executive of Visa
International, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Visa is one of the three
leading international payment card organisations which, by the end of this
year, are due to have agreed common technical specifications for chip cards.
Later this month the three - comprising also Europay International and
Mastercard International - should have agreed definitions for how the chip
card and point-of-sale terminal will deliver services to the cardholder.
That will mark the second stage of three sets of specifications for chip
cards. The work is intended to be completed by the end of this year.
Two months ago, the first set, dealing with electrical and mechanical
specifications for making chip cards and for point-of-sale terminals, was
signed off, enabling manufacturers to begin work on microprocessor chips in
payment cards. The third stage will cover how a transaction will be
completed.
But the process of realising the card issuers' aim of more secure cards with
a wealth of added-value services is a slow and expensive one: Visa says both
it and Mastercard have been working on standards for chip cards for four
years.
The length of the process is partly determined by the pace of technological
developments. There is also diplomacy involved in the delicate task of
achieving co-operation without destroying competition. Compatibility and
acceptability are key selling points for the product.
'It's about finding a common technical platform which allows for different
products,' says Francis van den Bosch, Europay's director of commercial
affairs. 'First you have to agree on what you're going to agree about.'
The scope for diversity is particularly important for justifying in business
terms the investment a move to chip technology will require from thousands
of organisations internationally.
The pressure to develop chip technology began as an anti-fraud measure, on
the basis that it would significantly cut losses from card fraud and make
card security cheaper.
Van den Bosch says that the chip card is safer and is much more difficult to
'crack'. Its other advantage, of course, is that it enables much more
information to be stored.
The chip should also be able to deliver cheaper authorisation methods.
Authorisation on magnetic stripe cards involves telecommunications costs in
a significant proportion of transactions.
The chip card cuts costs by allowing more transactions to be authorised
off-line. 'Europe is not going to go the same way as the US banks went in
authorising on-line almost all transactions,' says Desbons.
'The chip card can identify the cardholder, authenticate the card and
authorise the transaction all in an off-line mode.'
In spite of these two savings, there is now a broad agreement within the
plastic card industry that the billions of US dollars in investment
worldwide can be justified only by using the capacity of the chip to deliver
new services.
'I don't think using the chip for security reasons will bring enough savings
to the table to justify the overall investment,' says Desbons. 'I do think
the investment is needed, but to make it happen value-added functions have
to be included.'
These functions will vary widely. Perhaps one quarter of the chip's capacity
would be devoted to common functions, with a further quarter for functions
specified by the payment system and another for functions chosen by the
issuing bank.
Storing information about customers, from their status with their bank
manager to the type of hire car they prefer, is envisaged as a way of
speeding up procedures at, for example, hotel check-ins and adding value to
the cardholder.
Such plans are still at an early stage. A more immediate issue is to resolve
sensitivity about how the new specifications impinge on chip card systems
already in use.
The French banks, for example, have introduced chip technology and they are
unlikely to be content with specifications requiring them to start again
when 20m or so cards are in circulation.
At the same time, there is no wish to simply follow the French lead to fit
in with their system.
The approach of the payment organisations seems to be almost to regard the
French system as a giant pilot study: they are ready to learn from the
experience while recognising that improvements must be made.
In the UK plans are much less advanced, with Apacs, the payment clearing
services association, recently approving the start of the first phase of
developing a method of authenticating chip cards.
Such different rates of progress show the importance of international
specifications in this area. Only when they have been agreed will the
evolution of the chip card gather pace.

HP Bulmer, the cider maker, has appointed Alan Flockhart, 49, as its new
finance director, replacing Michael Ward, who recently took up the same role
with Lloyds Chemists.
Ward in turn replaced Richard Steele, now finance director at Storehouse.
Ward first joined the company in May 1989, leaving his post as finance
director of Bassett Foods.
Flockhart is no stranger to brewing; he is joining Bulmer from Wolverhampton
and Dudley Breweries, where he has been finance director since 1985. Before
that he was finance director of Scottish Brewers, a subsidiary of Scottish
and Newcastle.
The UK's largest cider producer - it makes nearly half of the 92m gallons
annually consumed - Bulmer recently adopted a new policy of recruiting 200
part-time tasters to help maintain quality.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Business and the Law: Looking after number three - How
protection could be extended to outsiders in European mergers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CELIA HAMPTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A company does not have to be a party to a merger to be affected by a
European Commission merger decision. The Commission may find that a merger
would be acceptable from a competition point of view if none of the parties
had links with other competitors in the market. The sacrifice of a business
arrangement with a 'third party' company may seem a small price to pay for
approval of the merger. If accepted, the Commission makes this a condition
of the merger's clearance.
A condition of this sort is not a finding for or against the third party. It
passes no judgment on the business arrangements in question or on the third
party's conduct or competitive position. It simply says that the companies
seeking approval for their merger plan cannot have it unless one of them
terminates its relationship with the third party.
This might seriously damage the third party's interests through no fault of
its own. It would be wrong in principle for the law simply to ignore it.
How the third party can be protected is not without difficulty. A merger
clearance is a legally binding decision taken with a view to securing a
competitive market in the public interest. It is nevertheless given for the
benefit of the merging companies, not as general legislation affecting
everyone equally. Private interests should be treated even-handedly.
Favouring one set of interests over another lacks the necessary balance. It
could be argued that a merger decision that lacks this balance should be
struck down by the European Court.
A third party may undoubtedly seek annulment of a Commission decision if
denied procedural rights, such as the right to make its views known during
the merger inquiry. Yet private parties have no right to make the Commission
take any notice of their views. Their legal rights can only be fully
protected if the Commission has to consider them when deciding whether to
approve a merger.
The Court of First Instance has a case pending in which a ruling to this
effect may be made. Indeed, the issue has already been identified as a
serious one. On June 15, Mr Cruz Vilaca, the court's president, suspended
the relevant part of a merger decision until the court deals with the third
party's claims in depth*.
The case was brought by SCPA, the French potash company. In December 1993,
the Commission cleared the acquisition of control of MdK, the former East
German potash producer, by Kali+Salz (K+S), a subsidiary of chemicals group
BASF.
As one of the conditions of clearance, the Commission told K+S that it must
sell its own and MdK's shares in Kali-Export, a Vienna-based export agency
handling sales by four European potash producers on the world market. SCPA
was a partner in Kali-Export.
Mr Cruz Vilaca found that K+S's departure from Kali-Export would inevitably
lead to its closure. As a result, SCPA would have to set up its own
international marketing arm, at considerable cost. He ordered that the
condition in the Commission's merger decision should not be enforced until
the court had considered whether - and, if so, how - SCPA's rights in
Kali-Export should be protected.
European law might be expected to follow the fairly universal rule that the
law should not allow a person to be deprived of legal rights without
providing a remedy. The court could strike out the condition under articles
173 and 174 of the EC treaty, on the ground that it infringed the treaty or
'any rule of law relating to its application'. This would leave the
troublesome question of whether the merger could be allowed to go ahead,
since removal of the condition might undermine the reasoning that enabled
the Commission to clear the merger.
More generally, a high level of protection for the third party would limit
the Commission's room for manoeuvre under the Merger Regulation. If the
third party could stop it imposing a particular condition, the merger might
have to be prohibited.
The court might decide that the harm to the third party should be remedied
after the event by private law means, such as damages. Compensation may be
available anyway. For example, the company that is told to cancel its
agreement with a third party may be liable for breach of contract.
But private litigation is expensive and risky. The company that causes the
loss to the third party might escape liability for some reason. There might
be no relevant right of action, or compensation might not be an adequate
remedy.
The conditions imposed by the Commission tend to affect long-term
proprietorial interests rather than day-to-day business dealings. This
reflects the Merger Regulation's concern with the structure of industry
rather than its business conduct. It also makes it more probable that a
third party's losses cannot be fully compensated by money alone.
Examples of conditions imposed by the Commission include sale of a
shareholding by one of the merging companies, disposal of its entire
business in a particular market, termination of overlapping memberships of
company boards and non-renewal of a patent licensing agreement. Potential
harm to third parties may be mitigated in the decision. For example, it may
allow time for the sale of a large shareholding to safeguard the share
price.
Private remedies might yield a satisfactory solution in the individual case.
This would not be without its burdens for the Commission, however. It would
be reasonable to expect it to make sure that the third party had an
effective right of action and remedy. The Commission might itself deal with
the issue of liability to third parties and make payment of compensation a
condition of clearance. Within the tight Merger Regulation timetable, this
might prove impractical. The question might be referred to arbitration.
Overall it seems unlikely that the court will ride roughshod over the rights
of third parties. It has repeatedly recognised their right to challenge
competition rulings and approvals of state aid. It seems that the court has
not yet overturned a Commission decision specifically because of the harm
done to a third party's subsisting legal rights. It now has the opportunity
to do so, or at least to say when it should be done.

Commission; Commission Decision M308, Kali+Salz/MdK/Treuhand, December 14

FT  23 AUG 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Better to launch and lose
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Encouragement for entrepreneurs to 'have a go and hang the risk of failure'
has not been a part of the British way of life for many years. In spite of
the Thatcher era, to have launched and lost is not widely seen as better
than never to have launched at all.
The cause of those wanting to lift this dead hand has been further
undermined this month with publication of a report* from CCN Business
Information, the credit information provider.
According to CCN, nearly a quarter of all company directors in the UK have
been involved with companies that have failed during the past six years.
More than 10 per cent of these directors have had more than one failure and
1,000 display the qualities of rubber - bouncing back from more than 10
failed companies.
CCN uses this data, gleaned from analysis of 931,000 directors, to call for
a clampdown on 'serial failures'. It says the delay in pursuing
disqualification of directors and inefficiency on the part of the courts
means serial failures are 'free to defraud and lose other people's money'.
In spite of the increase in company failures in the past five years, CCN
says, the number of disqualifications has stayed at 300 to 400 a year. CCN
recognises that company failure does not necessarily imply dishonesty or
incompetence and that companies are put into liquidation for perfectly
legitimate reasons.
It calls for more investigation of directors' track records before they
receive credit, a move that would lead to more prudent credit management.
But CCN's emphasis on the small percentage of directors involved with
multiple failures denies an important fact. Businesses fail all the time.
For many directors, this experience is more valuable than any business
school training and makes them better credit risks.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Support industry - A look
at a confusing range of support services for businesses in north-east
England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
North-east England was once described, by a local university academic, as 'a
policy laboratory where every conceivable kind of economic development
initiative has been tested, often to destruction'.
From the wooing of Nissan and its Pounds 900m European car plant to advice
on setting up creches on council estates, the economic regeneration industry
is arguably the region's greatest growth sector.
This month's loss of yet more jobs from shipbuilder Swan Hunter, where
nearly 2,000 have gone since receivership 15 months ago, underlines how much
Tyneside, in common with Britain's other traditional industrial heartlands,
needs to succeed in creating new jobs.
In such areas, substantial numbers of male manual jobs have been
disappearing for two decades or more, eroding not only employment but the
confident expectation of a lifetime's work with a large employer.
Across all political parties and interest groups in Tyneside, there is
widespread agreement that indigenous growth through expansion of small and
medium-sized businesses is at least as important to economic restructuring
as inward investment. But there is less clarity about how that growth can
best be encouraged by the multiplicity of bodies set up to foster it.
Graham Woosey, general manager of Tyneside's recently launched Business
Link, admits the range of support services is confusing. A former company
secretary at Swan Hunter and knowledgeable about the local business scene,
Woosey was surprised to discover how many initiatives there were in the
local job creation sector.
In some parts of the country, he says, the government's one-stop shop
Business Link initiative is operating in a 'greenfield' setting. Places such
as Tyneside, Manchester and Merseyside already have many organisations
geared up to helping the entrepreneur.
Business Link Tyneside has 13 core partners and its 'wider partnership'
includes a further 25 bodies and programmes, all active in encouraging the
area's economic growth.
The Business Link, says Woosey, is not a signposting mechanism, but a
'delivery organisation', working alongside its clients to help them through
the bewildering range of advice and information available from local support
bodies.
Some of these organisations, such as enterprise and economic development
agencies Project North East and Entrust, were founded in response to the
recession of the late 1970s and have continued to evolve.
Other initiatives set up around that time, by the now-defunct Tyne and Wear
county council, have been joined by a raft of other projects. They range
from university schemes, geared to spinning off businesses from top-level
research and development, to central government-funded and private-sector
led projects aimed at helping residents of some of the most deprived inner
city areas create their own jobs.
The five district councils of Tyne and Wear have also been highly active for
many years in economic regeneration, offering business start-up training and
counselling, grants and subsidised workspace. Vocal local industrialists
have recently weighed in too with their own Manufacturing Challenge, aimed
at doubling the region's manufacturing base and trebling exports within a
decade.
Figures from the Tyne and Wear Research and Intelligence Unit, based on the
1981 and 1991 census returns, indicate that this effort has borne fruit;
over that period, self-employment rose by 43 per cent - representing about
10,000 people.
David Irwin, chief executive of Project North East, detects a psychological
sea change since the late 1970s, away from the belief that anybody starting
up in business is 'one of them'.
Business Link's four business advice centres in Tyneside, founded as a
partnership between enterprise agencies, local authorities and the Tec,
indicate just how far that change has gone; in the three years to April
1994, they dealt with more than 100,000 inquiries. In the four months since
early April, 8,269 people passed through their doors.
'One of the problems we find in dealing with new government ministers, and
even civil servants, is they are always looking for the new, sexy idea they
can put a label on,' says Alan Clarke, Newcastle's chief economic
development officer. 'The tendency is, let's have a competition to come up
with a new idea, usually for less money. It's infuriating.'
Irwin notes an underlying contradiction. 'We tell the clients they must be
market driven; the government tries to make us policy driven.'
For some agencies the thirst for newness is life-threatening. 'Fighting for
funds takes all of my time,' says Jim Hedley, managing director of the
Gateshead-based Innovation Centre, whose staff have assisted more than half
the region's estimated 5,500 manufacturing companies since the centre was
founded 13 years ago.
The government says its objective in creating its Single Regeneration Budget
(SRB), for which 1995-96 bids are now being prepared, is to tackle the
plethora of separate programmes and target local needs more effectively.
But the invitation to bid for new projects, and the winding down of the
government-funded Urban Programme, has serious implications for bodies such
as the Innovation Centre. Urban Programme, drawn from 20 north-east local
authorities, was a key source of funding. European funding, another vital
input, is also still unclear for next year.
'I really don't know if we will be in existence next April,' says Hedley.
'It seems crazy when the government places such emphasis on developing new
processes and initiatives.'
Yet the move to SRB is also seen by some Tyneside regeneration specialists
as an opportunity - provided it is adequately funded - to inject greater
coherence into the area's economic development activities.
One review it has prompted is a rethink by Tyneside Tec of the Enterprise
Allowance scheme, under which more than 2,500 small businesses have started
in the area since 1990. A move is likely, says Tec operations manager Tom
Arnott, away from automatic eligibility for those satisfying the rules
towards a more discretionary system focused on business growth.
The jury is still out on the question of whether all these support services
have in fact worked. It is difficult to tell how many businesses which are
successfully growing would have failed without their help.

As you head back from the summer holiday, how healthy is your business?
As every entrepreneur who has survived the past few years will know, growing
after a recession is fraught with danger as cash flow is stretched while
resources have yet to be replenished by profits. But there are many more
pitfalls. With the help of a quiz put together by accountants Blick
Rothenberg, you can decide whether your business is in as good shape as your
suntan.
Interest rates. While rates are at their lowest level for years, some
pundits say they will edge up again in the near future. What effect might
this have on your company's profitability? Work out your interest cover -
the number of times interest payable is covered by pre-tax profits before
interest. Is your number (a) more than 5 (b) between 2 and 5 (c) between 1
and 2 (d) less than 1?
Dependence on one customer. Work out what percentage of your turnover your
largest customer accounts for. Is it (a) less than 5 per cent of turnover
(b) 5-10 per cent (c) 10-20 per cent (d) more than 20 per cent?
Loss of several customers. How important are your five largest customer
accounts? (a) less than 10 per cent of sales (b) 10-20 per cent (c) 25-50
per cent?
Suppliers. Is there one supplier who accounts for a large percentage of your
materials? Does your largest supplier supply (a) less than 10 per cent of
your key materials (b) 10-25 per cent (c) 25-50 per cent (d) more than 50
per cent?
Key suppliers. Who are the managers responsible for the key functions in
your business - sales, marketing, production, personnel, distribution or
finance? How long could you continue if one of them left before the need to
replace them became urgent? (a) more than 12 months (b) six to 12 months (c)
one to six months (d) less than one month?
Workforce. Have you increased or cut your workforce recently? If so, by what
percentage in the past 12 months? (a) less than 10 per cent (b) 10-25 per
cent (c) 25-50 per cent (d) more than 50 per cent?
Turnover. How quickly has your turnover risen or fallen in the past 12
months? (a) less than 10 per cent (b) 10-25 per cent (c) 25-50 per cent (d)
more than 50 per cent?
Plant and equipment. Have you made any large purchases in the past 12
months? If so, what percentage of the cashflow of your business have your
committed in this area? (a) less than 25 per cent (b) 25-50 per cent (c)
50-100 per cent (d) more than 100 per cent?
Profit margins. Have your profit margins dropped in the past 12 months? If
so, by how much? (a) less than 10 per cent (b) 10-25 per cent (c) 25-50 per
cent (d) more than 50 per cent?
Quick asset ratio. Calculate your quick asset ratio - the ratio of your
current assets, excluding stock, to your current liabilities. Is it (a) more
than 1.2 (b) between 1 and 1.2 (c) between 0.7 and 1 (d) less than 0.7?
Assessment. For each question you have answered, score as follows: (a) 4 (b)
3 (c) 2 and (d) 1. If you scored more than 30 points you are running a
splendidly stable business, Blick Rothenberg says. You might as well have
stayed on the beach because your business is so stable it would not miss
you. If you scored between 22 and 30 points, you are more vulnerable but you
also have more excitement in your life.
A score of between 15 and 21 points indicates you are likely to return to
some nervous creditors.
If you scored under 15 points, go back to the beach and recruit someone who
scored above 22 points because you could be in serious trouble.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Labour attacks supergun 'scandal'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday launched an attack on government moves to disqualify six
directors of Astra Holdings, the collapsed munitions company involved in the
Iraqi 'supergun' affair.
Mr Michael Meacher, the shadow open government minister, said the Department
of Trade and Industry's treatment of the directors was 'a significant piece
of the cover-up over arms to Iraq'. He said it was 'a grade-one scandal'.
The DTI launched disqualification proceedings this month, nearly a year
after seven Astra directors were criticised in a DTI inspectors' report on
the company's Pounds 22m acquisition in 1989 of PRB, a Belgian defence
company.
Astra, which is in receivership, became involved in the 'supergun' affair
after discovering that PRB had a contract to supply propellant.
Customs officers blocked the project by seizing giant steel tubes in 1990.
The DTI report criticised the directors for continuing with the PRB
acquisition in spite of warnings from advisers about PRB's financial
condition. They were also criticised for misleading shareholders about
Astra's financial situation.
Mr Meacher yesterday wrote to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, claiming that the proposed disqualifications were 'a shabby and
sordid political vendetta'.
He said the move was 'designed to intimidate and discredit the former Astra
directors because of what they have revealed about the secret and illicit
arms trade with Iraq and the government's connivance in it'.
He added that the government wanted Astra closed because the directors had
discovered that subsidiaries it had purchased were being used, with the
connivance of the government, for the illegal export of arms to Iraq during
the Iran-Iraq war.
Mr Meacher said the political motives behind the government's actions were
'clearly revealed' by the exclusion from the disqualification list of Mr
Stephan Kock, an Astra director with links to the security services.
Mr Kock was criticised by the DTI report, but the department said there was
insufficient evidence to justify disqualification. Mr Meacher said it was
'obvious' that he had been excluded because of his 'close links' with the
security services.
Mr Meacher also criticised the government for failing to reply to a
parliamentary question tabled six weeks ago asking when Mr Kock had acquired
British nationality, and which government department intervened with the
police in Argyll, Strathclyde, after he fired an automatic pistol at two
motorists in January 1990.
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, a junior defence minister, promised a month ago
to write to Mr Meacher, but has not done so.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Claim of rise in student drop-outs rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Universities and students' unions have rejected claims in a survey published
today that the number of students leaving university without completing
their degree is increasing.
The Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals said that 13 per cent of
students had left without completing their degree during the academic year
1992-93 - exactly the same figure as the year before. They said this
compared favourably with university drop-out rates on the continent.
The National Union of Students agreed that the drop-out rate was remaining
constant, but it predicted that it could rise - a survey of its members
earlier this year found 20 per cent had 'considered' dropping out due to
financial hardship.
The PUSH Guide to Which University, which is published today in association
with Lloyds Bank, also provides details on student debt. The survey's
findings show that the average level of student indebtedness increased
almost 50 per cent this year, from Pounds 614 to Pounds 916 per student.
This varied regionally, with debt levels generally linked to living costs.
The study found that the highest level of indebtedness was in Leeds, at
Pounds 1,800 per year.
Mr Jim Murphy, NUS president, attacked the government's decision to cut
grants by 10 per cent and replace them with an increased subsidised loans
facility. Describing the rise in debt as the 'inevitable' consequence of
government policies, he said: 'Student grants have been frozen, and now cut.
But living costs haven't'

FT  23 AUG 94 / Dairy industry locks horns with new market: A look at the
opposition to plans for milk purchasing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dairy industry's trade body and biggest companies yesterday launched a
co-ordinated attack on the arrangements for milk purchasing that take effect
when the Pounds 3.3bn milk market is liberalised in just over two months.
Following a board meeting on Friday, the Dairy Trade Federation announced it
was going to the High Court to seek judicial review of the government's
'mishandling' of the deregulation process.
At the same time Northern Foods, Unigate and MD Foods, three of the biggest
dairy companies, warned that retail prices could rise sharply and the dairy
processing industry could lose jobs to continental Europe.
They are furious that Milk Marque, the voluntary farmers' co-operative that
will succeed the statutory Milk Marketing Board on November 1, has been able
to raise the prices at which it sells to them because it controls 65 per
cent of supplies in England and Wales.
Farmers are free under the new arrangements to sell their milk either to
Milk Marque - which will act as a broker - or direct to the dairy companies.
Most have opted for the former, although up to 15 per cent are still
undecided.
At the heart of the dispute is the bidding process introduced by Milk Marque
to fix the prices and quantities of milk it sells to the dairy companies.
Yesterday was the deadline for companies to sign contracts with Milk Marque,
which many said they were doing 'under duress'.
At each of the three rounds of bidding, Milk Marque has raised prices. But
the dairy companies wanted 30 per cent more milk than Milk Marque has to
offer, so it is also scaling back allocations.
Mr Andrew Dare, Milk Marque chief executive, said it was asking for an
average of 25.5p per litre, compared with the present price of 24p - an
increase of just over 6 per cent.
But the dairy companies say this does not take account of recent changes in
the value of the green pound - the artificial exchange rate at which
Ecu-based support prices are converted into sterling - which means a further
rise in prices of 3.5 per cent.
Furthermore, the average price covers seven categories of milk, carrying
increases ranging between 2.7 per cent and 24 per cent, they say.
Unigate, which accounts for about 13 per cent of milk supplies, said its
operating profits could be down by as much as Pounds 10m in the year to
March 31 because of the cost increases.
Mr Ross Buckland, chairman, said British dairy companies were trapped by
Common Agricultural Policy quotas, which mean Britain can produce only 85
per cent of its milk requirements.
Unigate faces price increases of about 12 per cent in the milk it uses for
yoghurt, and up to 24 per cent in milk for cheese production, he said. Yet
input costs in other European Union member states such as France, where
supply exceeds demand, were falling.
Imports of dairy produce would be sucked into Britain from France, 'where
you don't have a government-created, 65 per cent monopoly which is able to
set its own selling conditions and its own prices in a quota-capped regime,'
he said. He predicted thousands of job losses in the industry and said
Unigate's 8,000-strong workforce faced 'significant' cuts.
Some companies are already in trouble. Last week the Galloway Cheese
Company, which is majority-owned by the Scottish Milk Marketing Board
through its commercial arm, went into receivership, putting 130 jobs at
risk.
The board said banks had been reluctant to continue support for the company
without new guarantees or funds because of 'the uncertainties of the
marketplace following deregulation'.
Mr Chris Haskins, chairman of Northern Foods, the biggest dairy company,
said farmers could suffer, too. 'They may have a honeymoon, but prices would
collapse as factories close, the value-added business goes elsewhere and
imports come in.'
But the National Farmers' Union said the old system gave dairy companies an
advantage over producers.
Ms Julie Smith, the union's milk adviser, said: 'They've been cushioned from
competition and they've fossilised a bit. I don't think it's going to be as
drastic as they say, but this is a necessary jolt.'

FT  23 AUG 94 / Increased Sun price fails to halt paper war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The newspaper price-cutting wars seem likely to continue into the autumn in
spite of yesterday's 2p increase in the cover price of The Sun to 22p.
The rise came as Today - also a News International title - ended local
price-cutting experiments in Liverpool and Scotland and returned to a
national cover price of 25p.
News International insisted yesterday that the price increase at The Sun
merely reflected rising costs, particularly of newsprint, and did not
represent a retreat from its aggressive pricing policy.
Early estimates suggest that The Sun has been selling about 4.17m copies a
day in the traditionally dead month of August. There were claims that
circulation rose 1 per cent yesterday in spite of the price increase. Sales
were helped by heavy television promotion of a 16-page football supplement
and the latest news of the Princess of Wales.
The 2p increase will help the Daily Mirror as it narrows the price
differential between the two tabloids to 5p. The Mirror believes it is
beginning to close the gap with The Sun. Its estimated circulation is 2.7m,
or 3.8m when the Glasgow-based Daily Record is included.
Although News International said prices were always kept under review, it
insisted yesterday: 'There is certainly no plan to increase the price of The
Times at the moment.'
The broadsheet, at 20p, is now 2p cheaper than The Sun and is estimated to
be selling just under 600,000 copies a day.
The other main participants in the marketing struggle seem determined to
keep their nerve.
'We're fighting for every copy and for our lives,' said Mr Stephen Grabiner,
managing director of The Telegraph group. He said that cutting the price of
The Daily Telegraph to 30p during the week had emphasised the paper's
pre-eminence.
Circulation had slipped below 1m, but the paper is now believed to be
selling more than 1.07m copies a day. 'We are not going to do anything with
our price unless The Times reacts,' said Mr Grabiner. 'We are going to try
to prove to Rupert Murdoch that the Pounds 30m or Pounds 40m it is costing
him isn't worth it.'
The Independent, which reluctantly moved to 30p to protect its circulation
and has now increased sales to about 285,000, is expected to stay at that
price for the time being.
The price wars have undoubtedly hit profits, but according to July figures
the national broadsheet market was up 8.4 per cent year-on-year. The tabloid
market rose 3.21 per cent.
The first hard evidence of the cost of the adventure will come on Thursday
with News International's results, but the bill will probably be a good deal
less than the Pounds 50m suggested by some analysts.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Archer's broker 'happy' about Anglia share role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Broosk Saib (above), for whom Lord Archer placed orders to buy and sell
Anglia Television shares, last night said he was 'very happy' about his role
in the transaction, which has been the focus of a Department of Trade and
Industry investigation into alleged insider trading, William Lewis writes.
'I am happy, I am very happy, I am comfortable and I am very calm about the
whole thing as I know there are no problems,' he said. Lord Archer placed an
order for Mr Saib to buy 50,000 Anglia shares a few days before a Pounds
292m takeover offer by MAI for the television company. The DTI said last
month it would be taking no further action against Lord Archer after a
five-month inquiry. Lady Archer sits on the Anglia board.
When asked how he felt about making an Pounds 80,000 profit from the share
transaction, Mr Saib said: 'Anyone could buy shares, and I have bought a lot
of shares in my lifetime, and I continue to do so.' He added: 'I have no
problem and I hope neither has Lord Archer. I feel there is nothing in the
case.'

FT  23 AUG 94 / Minister and Remploy set to meet
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Phillip Oppenheim, the employment minister, will today meet Remploy, the
manufacturer whose status as a priority supplier was removed by the
government in line with a European directive on public procurement.
It is the first direct contact between the government and the company, which
employs 8,600 disabled workers in 95 factories in Britain, since Mr Michael
Portillo, employment secretary, said he would comply with the directive.
Mr Portillo said the new EU directive makes illegal the Priority Suppliers
Scheme, which gave companies employing large numbers of disabled people some
advantages in bidding for government work.
EU officials have criticised his decision to end the scheme without
referring to them because it was not intended to harm disabled workers.
The talks come as Remploy workers were being balloted on strike action after
rejecting a 2.5 per cent pay offer.
Remploy said the move by the GMB general union was 'opportunist' and
designed to scare the workforce into strike action.
The union claimed the company's offer was linked to a cut in sick leave and
changes in working patterns which could mean a 12-hour day without overtime
pay.
But Remploy insisted that its offer to employees 'is the best possible in a
difficult trading situation. It does not contain any proposals about
shift-working or working hours. Neither are there plans to introduce a
12-hour day without overtime.
'There is no reduction being made in sick pay. We are seeking only to reduce
overall absence levels - with a monitoring scheme - as these currently run
at the unacceptably high rate of 12 per cent.'
The deadline for the postal ballot is September 8. The result is expected to
be announced during the TUC annual conference.

FT  23 AUG 94 / More visitors to historic properties
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
About 70m visits were made to historic properties in England last year, an
increase of 3 per cent over 1992, the English Tourist Board said yesterday.
Buckingham Palace, open to the public for the first time, attracted 377,000
people in 56 days, making it the 13th most popular entrance-charging
attraction.
Visitors to historic properties spent Pounds 192m, a rise of 8 per cent on
1992. The number of visitors to Forde Abbey, Dorset, rose by 49 per cent
while visits to Harewood House, West Yorkshire, and Wilton House, Wiltshire,
rose by 37 per cent. Leeds Castle in Kent (up 10 per cent) and Dover Castle
(up 11 per cent) also showed strong rises.
Westminster Abbey was England's most visited historic building last year,
with 2.5m visitors.
Of the admission-charging attractions, top place went to the Tower of London
with 2.3m visitors, a rise of 4 per cent on 1992. St Paul's Cathedral,
London, was second with a 36 per cent rise to 1.9m last year.
The next five places were the Roman Baths and Pump Room, Bath (898,142
visitors), Windsor Castle state apartments (813,059), Warwick Castle
(751,02600), Stonehenge (668,607), and Shakespeare's birthplace,
Stratford-upon-Avon (606,697).
The popularity of three famous ships faded. Visits to the Cutty Sark,
Greenwich, fell 14 per cent. The Mary Rose, Portsmouth, was down 13 per
cent, and HMS Victory, also at Portsmouth, fell 5 per cent.

FT  23 AUG 94 / BR runs 45% of strike-hit service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Rail said it ran 45 per cent of its normal services yesterday
afternoon, the largest number of trains to run during strike action since
the start of the railway signal workers' dispute 11 weeks ago.
Railtrack said it had managed to open 40 per cent of the 10,000-mile rail
network to train services, slightly more than during last week's two-day
strike.
The company, which manages British Rail's track, signalling and stations,
said 530 signal workers had worked last week, including 309 members of the
RMT transport union. At the start of the strike only 337 signal workers had
reported for duty including 131 RMT members.
Railtrack yesterday said that it did not yet know how many signal workers
would be working during the present 24-hour stoppage, which ends at midday
today, but it expected a further small increase. BR is seeking to put some
of its staff in Railtrack signal boxes but has not yet done so.
The union denied that there had been any significant return to work by its
members and said they were still 'solidly supporting' the stoppages. It
accused Railtrack of becoming more ruthless in its attempt to open up more
track and break the strike.
The most significant addition to the operating rail network yesterday was
the east coast main line from London to Edinburgh which was open along its
entire length for the first time, BR said.
InterCity ran an almost full service in some regions. The Chiltern line
between London Marylebone, Banbury and Birmingham also ran a nearly normal
service while 90 per cent of trains ran in the Thames region and 60 per cent
on Merseyrail.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said: 'Railtrack have been able to
open up some additional parts of the network today because they have become
more clever, as well as more ruthless, in their exploitation of supervisors,
not through a return to work by RMT signalling grades. If cracks are
developing in the dispute it is on the management side.'
Many of the train operating units of BR have produced detailed timetables of
their services for travellers during the present 24-hour strike.
RMT is planning a further 48-hour strike by signal workers on Tuesday and
Wednesday next week.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Ghost Towns: Decay and hope in 'Queen of the North' - With
MPs due to publish a report on shopping centres in the autumn, the first of
a series examines claims that urban centres are beyond repair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A stroll along the High Street of Stockton-on-Tees reveals past glories,
recent decline and a hint of hope for the future. Reputedly Britain's
widest, the High Street is the heart of a market town which received its
charter in 1310 and for centuries was a bustling port and trading centre.
Older residents remember the smart shops, the crowds, the thriving
thrice-weekly market. Mr Jack Klyman, chairman of the market traders'
association, said: 'We were considered the 'Queen of the North'.'
The open-air market survives and the 18th-century town hall still stands in
the centre of the street, but much else has changed.
Charity shops and amusement arcades now compete for attention with discount
outlets. A few high-street shops remain, including Marks and Spencer and
Boots, but Stockton is notably lacking in new clothes stores and upmarket
and independent retailers.
Many say the decline began in the 1960s, when the Castle Centre development
fronting on to the High Street replaced many of the old buildings.
New roads diverted traffic from the centre, and a policy of the local
authority during the 1970s of concentrating development on Middlesbrough
compounded Stockton's problems of under-investment. The decline of
traditional heavy industry cost Cleveland 63,000 jobs between 1975 and 1985
 -a quarter of its total. Local spending power dropped and in those 10
years, 40 national retailers left the town and only 15 moved in.
Today Stockton borough council insists the town centre has 'turned the
corner' and started its recovery. Some retailers, such as Mrs Elaine Smith,
manager of M&amp;S, say their business is healthy. But in the side streets the
tenacity of the few independent retailers who have clung on  - such as Mr
Tony Lockwood, who owns a shoe shop - is being severely tested.
Lockwood's was founded by his father and Mr Lockwood, who joined the family
business in 1961, said he was 'broken-hearted' at what has happened. 'The
staunch regulars are going. I don't know how long we can stay here.'
At the end of nearby Prince Regent Street, where clearance sites, decaying
buildings and a boarded-up cinema combine to depress the spirits, Mr Stephen
Grabham, a third-generation gentleman's outfitter, speaks with dignified
disgust of raising his shop's shutters only to find them spattered with
night-clubbers' urine.
He said: 'The decline in the area is terrible. Unless business picks up we
shall have to relocate to a nicer environment.'
This would be bad news for Stockton. Traders and development organisations
agree that what the town centre needs most is more quality retailers and
more parking space to attract affluent shoppers.
Stockton has the added difficulty of establishing an identity for itself in
the face of fierce competition from nearby Middlesbrough, Darlington and the
well-heeled market towns to the south, as well as out-of-town retailing.
These developments include the 500,000 sq ft Teesside Retail Park, an Pounds
80m scheme with plenty of parking. It was built on former racecourse land
and is only a couple of miles from the High Street.
Town-centre traders and the local authority are alarmed at proposals for a
180,000 sq ft extension, but Mr Duncan Hall, chief executive of the
government-funded Teesside Development Corporation which developed the
scheme, said the retail park is not undermining the town centre.
One of its objectives, he said, is to stop people travelling away from
Teesside to shop. 'All the shopping we have introduced was new to the area.'
The government's view of this will be known soon - the result of a public
inquiry in May into the expansion plan is expected in the autumn.
The impact of other development corporation schemes on the town centre is
less controversial. The new Tees barrage, for example, is expected to
transform the river behind the central shops into an attractive leisure
amenity.
The council and Stockton City Challenge, a government-funded urban
regeneration initiative, are working to develop this potential by bringing a
replica of Captain Cook's barque Endeavour to the riverside and introducing
art to the town centre.
A third of the Pounds 150m of public and private investment that City
Challenge hopes to bring to Stockton is earmarked for the town centre.
Early results include grant-aided improvement of shop fronts, town-centre
flats created in a 'living above the shop' scheme, new lighting in the High
Street, and the closing of some streets to most traffic. This autumn the
council will launch a Pounds 4.5m closed-circuit television system to help
reduce crime and increase public confidence.
Some retailers are unhappy about the traffic restrictions - buses still use
the street - and complain that it has cost parking spaces. But Mr Chris
Oldershaw, City Challenge manager, said more projects would bring a net
increase of about 1,000 spaces by 1998.
His proposal is for a Pounds 40m retail development behind the High Street
which is intended to rejuvenate it by creating quality units for retailers.
Mr Oldershaw believes Stockton's prospects are good, but warned: 'You don't
turn a town around overnight. We need to impress on people they must take a
long-term view.'

FT  23 AUG 94 / Brown attacks Rosyth timetable
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The rundown of the Rosyth naval base in Fife was a 'high-risk' option for
the Royal Navy, Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said yesterday.
Mr Brown, whose Dunfermline East constituency includes Rosyth, produced a
two-page naval signal marked 'restricted', sent from the commander of the
Faslane naval base on the Clyde to officials at Rosyth in July.
The Faslane commander warns in the signal that some facilities will not be
available for the transferred mine - sweeper squadron until late 1996. He
says a satisfactory outcome to a 'challenging programme' will depend on
getting enough men and money to manage it.
In particular, the commander warns that there is a 'high risk' of being
unable to convert two berths at Faslane by 1996 for the minesweepers to
occupy long-term. There is a similar risk, he says, that specialist storage
facilities will not be completed in 1996.
The Rosyth base is to be run down and its minesweeper squadrons transferred
to Portsmouth and Faslane as part of defence spending cuts.
Speaking at Inverkeithing near Rosyth, Mr Brown claimed Faslane was unable
to take the transferred workload from Rosyth without massive investment. He
said: 'The timetable for the closure of Rosyth naval base by 1996 cannot be
met. Faslane is unable to take the Rosyth workload without massive financial
investment.
'The whole project was not properly costed when the decision was made. The
timetable runs the risk of going completely wrong.'
Mr Brown said the decision to run down Rosyth was made without proper
financial information, without justification and without explanation of the
difficulties of timing.
He said he had screened the signal and carefully removed any confidential or
secret information that had no bearing on the Rosyth case. This would be
used in the Save Rosyth campaign's reply to the closure plans.
'The closure of Rosyth naval base has become the high-risk, high-cost and
high-unemployment option and should be rejected,' he said.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Revised GDP data show stronger recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recession was not quite as deep, and the recovery has not been quite as
weak, as previously thought, according to figures released yesterday by the
Central Statistical Office.
Revisions to past gross domestic product data show that output fell 2.1 per
cent in 1991, the worst year of the recession, rather than the 2.3 per cent
previously estimated. From the peak of 1990 to the trough of 1992, the total
fall in output is now estimated to have been 3.6 per cent rather than 3.9
per cent.
Economic growth last year is now estimated at 2 per cent from the previous
published figure of 1.9 per cent. Growth in the first two quarters of this
year has also been revised upwards to 0.9 and 1.0 per cent respectively.
Growth in GDP, on the expenditure measure, results from a combination of
consumption, investment and the net trade position. In the second quarter,
trade led the way, with net exports contributing 0.6 per cent of GDP, as the
visible trade deficit fell from Pounds 2.9bn to Pounds 2.1bn.
Investment fell 0.3 per cent in the second quarter. But the CSO said this
was partly due to an easing of the very high demand for cars and aircraft in
the first quarter. Compared with the same period last year second quarter
investment - or gross domestic fixed capital formation - was 6.4 per cent
ahead. Companies also reduced stocks by Pounds 694m in the second quarter
after destocking by
Pounds 696m in the first three months of the year.
Consumers' expenditure rose 0.4 per cent between the first and second
quarters and was 3 per cent ahead year-on-year. However, economists pointed
to the slowing pace of growth in consumer spending, which grew 1.2 and 1 per
cent respectively in the third and fourth quarters of last year.
Average earnings actually fell between the first and second quarters because
of the high level of bonuses in the first three months of the year. Although
employment rose slightly, the net result was a 0.1 per cent quarterly
increase in total employment income.
Inflationary pressures, as measured by the implied GDP deflator, remained
weak. The deflator, a measure of the costs of goods and services produced in
the UK, rose 0.1 per cent quarter-on-quarter and 1.9 per cent year-on-year.
The CSO also produced new information on external trade, in particular on
invisible items. The current account deficit for last year was revised down
to Pounds 10.3bn from the earlier estimate of Pounds 10.4bn and backward
revisions were also made to the deficits in 1990, 1991 and 1992.
The changed information on invisibles stemmed partly from a Bank of England
survey of gilt ownership. This found that overseas gilt ownership was more
widespread than previously thought, with the consequence that the invisible
surplus is reduced by higher interest payments on those gilts. The gilts
factor caused the 1990 current account deficit to widen Pounds 767m to
Pounds 19bn and the 1991 surplus increased by Pounds 524m to Pounds 8.2bn.
In 1992 and 1993, however, this factor was more than offset by additional
earnings from banks, particularly in the interest rate swaps market. The
1992 deficit accordingly narrowed to Pounds 9.8bn from the previously
estimated Pounds 10.2bn.
Partly due to exchange-rate movements, net external assets at the end of
1993 were Pounds 20.3bn, up from Pounds 10.6bn at the end of 1992.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Safety body holds 21 foreign ships
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A total of 21 foreign ships were detained in UK ports in July after failing
safety inspections, the Marine Safety Agency said yesterday.
The figure comes in the second monthly report on defective vessels arriving
at British ports. The first survey, in June, led to the detention of 17
vessels, three of which were still being held last month.
The government began inspecting foreign ships in UK ports in June after an
inquiry headed by Lord Donaldson into marine pollution incidents produced a
report which heavily criticised marine safety standards.
Mr Robin Bradley, chief executive of the agency which was set up April,
said: 'The response from the shipping industry to our June detention list
has been encouraging. The publication of a monthly list will strengthen our
campaign against unsafe ships.'
Ten of the vessels detained in July had significant defects in their
life-saving and fire-fighting equipment, while six had defects in their
radio installations. Two were held because of shortcomings in their crews,
while one was held because it had serious structural problems.
Five of the ships were registered under the Maltese flag, three were
registered in Liberia and two in Cyprus. Four had been inspected and
approved by the American Bureau of Shipping, three by Bureau Veritas, a
French classification society; and two each by the Norwegian body Det Norkse
Veritas, Germanischer Lloyd, and the Japanese Nippon Kaiji Kyokai. Of the
remaining vessels, two had not been approved at all.
One ship, the United Trust, a Greek-owned general cargo vessel flying the
Maltese flag, had badly corroded bulkheads, decks and support struts. The
chief officer had no papers and the radio receiver did not work. The ship
made temporary repairs and was then allowed to sail to Germany for permanent
repairs.
The failure of some countries that register vessels under their flags to
impose adequate controls has led to a shift towards inspections in the ports
where vessels call.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Pension funds may face extra tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Inland Revenue is considering taxing the sub-underwriting commissions
earned by pension funds in a move that could have widespread ramifications
for the industry.
The Revenue's office in Sheffield is believed to have approached a large
pension fund suggesting that its commissions may be subject to assessment.
This may lead to a test case before the Revenue special commissioners or in
the courts which could lead to the principle being applied more generally
across pension funds.
The move undermines the long-held assumption that such earnings are
tax-exempt, and comes five years after the Revenue last considered the
matter, which has been kept under review.
Sub-underwriting commissions are the fees charged when a lead underwriter on
a share issue passes on some of the risk to other investment institutions.
The rate has long been fixed at 1.25 per cent.
Section 592 of the 1988 Income and Corporation Taxes Act specifically
exempts underwriting commissions from income tax as long as they relate to
'casual' or 'occasional' profits.
The Revenue's case would hinge on showing that the commissions had become
part of regular trading activity for the pension fund in question.
A report commissioned by the Office of Fair Trading in July suggested the
risks taken by underwriters did not justify the 'excessive' profits made.
Mr Geoff Lindey, chairman of the investment committee of the National
Association of Pension Funds and head of UK institutional investment at J P
Morgan Investment Management, said: 'We have always believed these
commissions not to be taxable. We would not complain if they become taxable
prospectively but we would be very unhappy if the rules are changed
retrospectively.'
He said profit on commissions was too small to be worth the Revenue's effort
and a tax would encourage pension funds to withdraw from sub-underwriting in
a way which would decrease the number of institutions willing to spread the
risk on an equity issue.
The Inland Revenue said yesterday: 'There is no case with the special
commissioners at the moment. It is possible that there might be a case in
the future but we really cannot say any more at the moment.'

FT  23 AUG 94 / Irish-Americans set to urge IRA ceasefire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An influential Irish-American delegation which will visit Northern Ireland
this week is expected to encourage the early announcement of an IRA
ceasefire.
The delegation, which is expected in Belfast tomorrow, will meet Mr Gerry
Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA.
The group is headed by Mr Bruce Morrison, a former congressman who is
considered a close friend of Mr Bill Clinton, the US president.
He will be accompanied by other prominent Irish-Americans including Mr Niall
O'Dowd, publisher of the New York-based Irish Voice; the businessman Mr
William Flynn, and Mr Charles Feeney, head of General Atlantic, the
multinational.
Mr Adams yesterday described persistent speculation about an IRA ceasefire
as 'unhelpful' but said he considered the meeting with Mr Morrison 'an
important one'.
Mr Morrison played an important role in obtaining a temporary US visa for Mr
Adams earlier this year in spite of a long-standing ban on his entering the
US. During a visit to the province by Mr Morrison last year the IRA called
an unofficial seven-day ceasefire.
Speaking on Irish radio yesterday, Mr Morrison said: 'What needs to occur is
that the violent activity needs to stop. If the IRA takes a decision to
stop, steps must be taken to get the loyalist paramilitaries to stop as
well.
'In the context of there not being paramilitary activity, it then falls to
the political process to take steps to make it a permanent cessation.'
The British and Irish governments have again stressed in recent days that
only a permanent ceasefire by the IRA will allow Sinn Fein to enter into
direct talks with the two governments and round-table talks with the other
political parties in Northern Ireland.
The US embassy in Dublin emphasised that the visit of the delegation was
private and that no official business would be conducted by Mr Morrison.
Nonetheless, Mr Morrison's team has maintained close contact with political
figures in Northern Ireland over the past year, and is considered to be an
unofficial line of communication between the republican leadership and the
White House.
The Northern Ireland Office said it had no meetings planned with the
delegation, and unionist leaders said no meetings had been requested.
The Ulster Unionist party said: 'If they are dealing with Sinn Fein directly
I don't think the UUP will be interested in helping them with their
deliberations.'
Mr Morrison is best-known in Ireland for his role in getting US
Congressional approval for a special lottery system to allocate a large
quota of immigrant visas to Irish people wishing to settle in the US. More
than 70,000 people from Ulster and the Republic have entered the US in the
past five years.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Concern increases on late payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The value of long-overdue debts has risen to an all-time high, figures
released yesterday by Trade Indemnity, the specialist trade credit insurer,
show.
The average value of the debts - those which are unpaid 30 days after they
are due - rose 5 per cent in the last quarter to Pounds 153,000, says the
insurer's quarterly financial trends survey.
On average, payments are made 22 days after a debt is due. Just 2 per cent
of companies are paid on time.
The number of exporters being paid on time increased slightly from 11 per
cent to 13 per cent between the first and second quarters of the year. A
quarter of companies said they had suffered no bad debts in the past 12
months, while 3 per cent said they had suffered bad debts totalling more
than 2 per cent of their turnover.
Mr William Simpson, chief economist at Trade Indemnity, said the rising
trend of long-overdue debt was 'of concern' and could reflect credit-control
systems being unable to keep pace with levels of activity.
However he said there was 'encouraging news' of higher levels of trade in
most business sectors and that in general the figures showed that the
economic recovery appeared to be progressing steadily in the second quarter.
The survey shows that 41 per cent of respondents were operating at between
75 per cent and 99 per cent of their optimum rate of business activity, up 2
per cent on the first quarter of the year.
It shows that many companies are being adversely affected by price increases
in raw materials and a shortage of skilled labour. All but one of the 18
industry sectors examined said that price discounting was eroding profits.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Revenue to seek advisers' views
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Inland Revenue is planning to canvass the views of professional advisers
on how effectively it administers the tax system.
The survey will be the fourth in a series as part of its efforts to meet its
obligations under the Citizen's Charter to improve its service to taxpayers.
The project will cover accountants, lawyers and other 'agents' who are
involved in preparing corporate and personal tax returns and are in regular
contact with the Revenue.
The survey is likely to be carried out towards the end of the year.
The intention is to find out what the agents want, how far those
requirements are met by the Revenue, and how well the agents believe the tax
system operates.
The Revenue will not be seeking views on the nature of taxation, which is
seen by officials purely as a political topic to be handled by ministers.
In line with the previous surveys, and to ensure that the answers provided
are candid, the work will be carried out by an independent market research
company following a competitive tender.
The Revenue has already surveyed the views of employers, pensioners and
taxpayers in general.
The first survey, carried out in 1992, found that taxpayers' greatest
concern was for the Revenue to get its tax assessments right first time
without the need for lengthy discussions with officials.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Consumers more confident, says poll
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Consumers have become more confident about their financial position and
about the economy over the past month, according to a Gallup poll for the
European Commission.
The monthly poll finds that 28 per cent of respondents expect the economic
situation to improve, as opposed to 29 per cent who believe it will worsen.
This negative balance of 1 per cent marks an upturn from the balance of
minus 6 per cent recorded in July and is the most optimistic result since
January.
Asked about their own financial position, a balance of 8 per cent expected
it to worsen over the next 12 months. However, this represents an increase
in optimism over July, when the balance was minus 17 per cent.
Consumer confidence had deteriorated in the early months of the year, a
development which many believed was caused by fears about the impact of tax
increases.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Airports to deal with noise disputes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Heathrow and Stansted airports are to deal directly with complaints about
aircraft noise from September 1, the government said yesterday.
Responsibility for handling complaints at Gatwick was transferred to the
airport in June, when Lord Goschen, aviation minister, said the other two
London airports would follow.
Complaints have been handled in the past by the Department of Transport,
which will remain responsible for noise mitigation measures and for any
complaints directly involving government aviation policy at Heathrow,
Stansted and Gatwick.
Lord Goschen said yesterday: 'The transport department is seeking to
increase the accountability of airports for the noise produced by their
aircraft operations.
'These three airports are now in a particularly good position to deal
directly with the public's complaints about noise and with requests for
information,' he added.
The decision was welcomed by the Heathrow Association for Control of
Aircraft Noise. Mr John Boulton, chairman, said last night: 'At first we
thought this self-policing would not be a good idea. But this should speed
things up a bit and, we hope, lead to more direct accountability'.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Mexican Elections: A new chance to break with the old ways -
A look at the Mexican election victor's scope to curb the ruling party's
powerful role
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
After his comfortable victory in the Mexican presidential election on
Sunday, Mr Ernesto Zedillo now faces the daunting task of preparing in
little more than three months for a presidency that stretches from December
1 until the end of the year 2000. Officials close to Mr Zedillo indicate
that he will concentrate on three broad areas until December - improving
relations with the opposition and broadening his support in the country,
beginning the reform of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, and
establishing policies and picking ministers for the next administration.
None of the three will be easy. Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the leader of the
leftist opposition, yesterday denounced the election as fraudulent, and
promised to challenge the results. Previous attempts to reform the PRI have
all failed, with the party apparently more resistant to change than any
other institution in Mexico. Also, many reforms Mr Zedillo has pledged touch
some of the most powerful and vested interests in the country.
But he will have some advantages. The election results reveal a depth of
support for the PRI even in a highly adverse political year for the party,
and indicate broad if not enthusiastic endorsement for the way the country
has been managed by President Carlos Salinas over the past six years.
With reports of electoral irregularities so far limited, Mr Zedillo can
claim a democratic mandate for his policies. The immediate issue is to heal
the wounds that the long and often bitter campaign generated.
Mr Cardenas of the leftist opposition and Mr Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of
the centre-right opposition both sharply criticised the manner of Mr
Zedillo's victory. They claim that the seemingly unlimited spending of the
ruling party, the biased media coverage of the campaign, and support from
the government indicate an unwillingness PRI to embrace democracy.
Mr Cardenas is his most immediate threat, although his poor showing in the
poll and perception that irregularities were isolated, may weaken his
ability to protest. Yesterday, Mr Cardenas said the fraudulent election was
a grave threat to Mexico's political stability. He called for supporters to
oppose the results. He was joined by an estimated 20,000 supporters, far
fewer than the number that backed him after the 1988 presidential election.
However even Mr Fernandez - whose party has generally supported the PRI -
withheld a full endorsement of Mr Zedillo's victory yesterday morning,
attacking what he called a 'profoundly iniquitous and profoundly unjust'
political system. But he said he would not join the protests, and would
challenge irregularities in the election courts.
Mr Zedillo, in his victory speech, made conciliatory gestures. He asked his
opponents to 'emphasise what we have in common, without sacrificing
differences'. He told foreign correspondents late on Sunday that 'my
responsibility is not only for those who voted for the PRI but those who
voted for other parties. Today, Mexico has a great opportunity to have an
important agreement among all the political parties.'
It is unclear what such an agreement might entail. Many people are so
sceptical about the PRI that they will not believe Mr Zedillo until he makes
specific concessions to the opposition. Mr Enrique Krauze, a prominent
historian, said Mr Zedillo 'should interpret the election as a mandate to
change the system from within.' But, given his way of campaigning and
previous record in government, 'we have not had the slightest sign that
makes us think he is willing to do this.'
Mr Zedillo may choose some members of the opposition to join his cabinet as
a way of winning their support. A plural cabinet would certainly fit in with
his pledge to represent all of Mexico, and not just the PRI. But it remains
to be seen what if any positions Mr Zedillo offers - more importantly the
opposition response is also awaited.
His pledge to reform the PRI will almost certainly form part of his attempts
to forge relations with the opposition.
Mr Zedillo promised in the campaign to separate the PRI from the government,
not to interfere in the ruling party when in office, and to propose
democratic methods for the party to pick its candidates.
Over the next three months, Mr Zedillo and his associates are likely to set
out the broad outlines of internal party reforms rather than making final
decisions, according to Mr Jesus Reyes Heroles, a respected economist who,
as the new head of the PRI's commission of ideology, is expected to play a
key role in drawing up the new policies. He said the reforms would have to
be discussed extensively with the rank-and-file, and agreed by them before
being implemented.
Other Zedillo associates accept the difficulty of pushing through such
reforms, which have always failed in the past. President Carlos Salinas
briefly experimented with internal primaries for some offices, before
abandoning the effort after they had caused bitter divisions in the party.
They seemed mainly to benefit the party old guard, who are generally well
organised to get out the vote.
Giving up the power of patronage would seriously weaken Mr Zedillo, who
would be giving up the traditional mechanism through which the Mexican
president keeps control of party officials and ensures their unwavering
loyalty. For this reason some are doubtful that Mr Zedillo will carry
through on the reforms, and others are worried that if does, he will find it
more difficult to govern the country.
Mr Zedillo's policies in government are likely to reduce his presidential
powers still further. According to officials, his administration will begin
by implementing reforms of the police, and of the judicial system, to make
them both more professional and the judiciary more independent of the
executive, and introduce policies that will devolve more powers to state and
municipal governments.
On the economy Mr Zedillo will work hard to ensure a smooth transition with
the current government. Aides say they will try to reach agreement with the
current administration on public spending priorities for next year. Mr
Zedillo has promised a rise in public investment of 25 per cent for next
year, in an effort to enhance economic growth.

FT  23 AUG 94 / US ready to discuss migration with Cuba
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, MIAMI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US officials said yesterday that they want to reopen direct talks with the
government of Cuban President Fidel Castro on allowing legal emigration from
Cuba, but they ruled out discussions of any other subject.
Mr Peter Tarnoff, under-secretary for political affairs at the US State
Department, said the US had held mid-level talks with Cuban officials on
migration issues since 1984. That was 'the proper forum' to discuss the
present surge in the number of Cuban refugees seeking to cross the Florida
Strait to the US in the last month.
'There's no prospect of a dialogue on other matters. We feel that the Cuban
government must attend to its responsibility for the current emergency and
that the proper place for that dialogue is the migration talk format,' Mr
Tarnoff said.
In the meantime, the US is negotiating with various Caribbean countries
which it hopes will agree to act as safe havens for Cuban refugees picked up
by the US Coast Guard in international waters.
Mr Tarnoff said he hoped that some countries would announce 'shortly' their
willingness to accept such refugees.
Cubans are still allowed to apply, in Cuba, for US visas or for political
asylum but, since President Bill Clinton's decision last week to reverse US
policy, those who try to make their own way to the US by boat or raft will
not be allowed in.
Those who reach the US in this manner are being interned at Krome camp near
Miami, while those picked up by the Coast Guard are being shipped to
Guantanamo Bay, the US military base in south-eastern Cuba.
As there are already nearly 15,000 Haitian refugees in tents at Guantanamo,
the base has room for only 10,000 Cubans.
Even so, the new policy appears to have done little so far to deter Cubans
from putting to sea in home-made rafts, inner tubes or small boats.
The Coast Guard yesterday reported that 1,293 people were picked up on
Sunday - the highest number in any one day since the 1980 exodus, which saw
125,000 people flee Cuba.
Mr Tarnoff said that the additional curbs announced this weekend by Mr
Clinton, such as a ban on currency remittances from Cuban-Americans in the
US to relatives on the island, were 'not aimed at the Cuban people, but are
intended to limit the ability of the Cuban government to accumulate foreign
exchange which it can use to sustain its structures and to suppress
dissent.'
However, he added, 'a blockade (of Cuba) as such is not presently being
contemplated.'
Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, visited southern Florida yesterday
to assess the scale of the refugee problem, and said all resources were
being concentrated on the exodus.
'We do not have orders at this time to effect an economic blockade. It would
require more resources, more ships than we have here to do that,' he said.
US treatment of Cuban refugees has now been brought into line with that of
Haitians, but US refusal to talk to Mr Castro continues to be contrasted
with its willingness to hold broad discussions with other countries it
regards as renegades, such as North Korea.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Mexican Elections: Battle over rules goes on - The country's
poll results are still a source of political controversy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The final judgment on the probity of Mexico's presidential and congressional
elections is yet to emerge, but Mexico's two main opposition parties will
enter a period of reflection, if not crisis, as a result,
The government of President Carlos Salinas declared itself satisfied with
the cleanliness of the polls. 'We see the complaints as more or less
isolated incidents that will need to be looked into but which wouldn't have
affected the outcome of the elections,' said a spokesman.
Others offered a more negative view. Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, candidate of
the opposition Party for Democratic Revolution, said the election was
invalidated through fraud. Mr Sergio Aguayo, head of Civic Alliance, a group
of non-government organisations and individuals which observed the election,
said yesterday: 'I want to announce that the quality of the election is in
question.' He added: 'Before proclaiming triumphs and losses, the legitimacy
of the elections must be determined.'
Despite advances in the Mexican electoral process, the elections are still a
source of political controversy and agreement does not yet exist on the
rules of the electoral game.
Electoral difficulties fall into three main areas:
Before polling day. These issues were summed up in a report published this
month by the Carter Centre of Emory University in Atlanta. 'An uneven
playing field which limits the ability of all political parties to compete
equitably remains of significant concern, especially regarding the
continuing bias of media coverage, the high cost of advertising, campaign
spending limits beyond the reach of any party except the PRI, and great
disparities in financial resources.'
Independent citizen magistrates appointed to oversee the elections have also
criticised slow processing of complaints - most against the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) - about breaches in the electoral
law.
Voting itself. The possibility of padding the electoral roll with dead or
non-existent people - common in the past - is now small, according to the
Carter Centre, but it said an independent audit did not address the issue of
disenfranchisement of those who believed they were on the roll.
On the day, the main problem surrounded special polling stations, where
those away from home or not on the polling station lists could vote. The
number of ballot papers in each of these stations was limited to 300, as
part of an agreement among all the parties to try to prevent double voting.
The question being asked by the opposition Party of Democratic Revolution
and others is why were so many people on the electoral roll not on the lists
of their local polling stations - forcing them to vote elsewhere.
Civic Alliance also reported that preliminary assessments suggested some 20
per cent of polling stations allowed voting by people not on the electoral
list, and some 9 per cent allowed voting by people who had already voted.
Fraudulent counting. This appears to have been much more difficult than in
the past, in part because large discrepancies between exit polls and quick
counts - from polling stations where voting had been observed - would have
shown up attempts at centralised fraud.
Mr Cardenas's call yesterday for protests against the elections raised the
temperature of the election aftermath. But he did not claim victory as he
had in the previous presidential elections in 1988 and even some
sympathisers felt his credibility was weakened by his poor electoral
showing.
In any case, the left is likely to undergo a period of self-examination. Mr
Cardenas had started the campaign by moving towards the centre, but towards
the end of the campaign his speeches once again veered to the left. This may
have been because of concerns that Sub-commander Marcos - leader of the
peasant rebellion in Chiapas  - threatens to take over the left if he moved
too far to the centre.
Some are expecting a split in the PRD if and when Mr Cardenas steps down,
between those seeking greater engagement with the political process, and
those considering it futile because the political system remains
undemocratic.
For the right-leaning National Action Party (PAN), the result it obtained
would even six months ago have been considered a triumph. The one televised
debate among the candidates propelled its candidate Mr Diego Fernandez de
Cevallos into serious contention for a time. However, there was
disappointment in party ranks at the result and a debate seems likely to
ensue about the extent to which the PAN - in the past six years, highly
supportive of the ruling party - should continue to co-operate with and be
identified with the PRI.
For now, however, both main opposition parties are left dependent more or
less on the goodwill of the ruling party to engage them more fully in the
Mexican political mainstream. They are sceptical that, despite Mr Zedillo's
conciliatory statements after the elections, the PRI will voluntarily cede
power after such a comfortable victory.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Mexican Elections: Stocks rise but caution sounded

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexican stocks surged by 1.8 per cent to a new six-month high at the end of
trading yesterday, after the ruling party's election victory. The peso also
appreciated significantly against the dollar.
However, analysts said that, because many investors had already bet heavily
on this outcome in the weeks before the election, profit-taking was likely
over the next few days. This did not occur yesterday because of the ample
margin of the ruling party's victory and an absence of civil unrest.
'There is no question that people are buying. . . and that there is a
general influx of capital into the market. But profit-taking may obscure the
market's fundamental long-term strength,' said Mr Chris Luft, lead trader
with Marvin &amp; Palmer, US money manager.
Those investors who have been valuing the market higher on the basis of
political events are expected to be the most cautious between now and Mr
Ernesto Zedillo's inauguration on December 1.
The strength of demonstrations called for by leftist leader Mr Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas, who finished a distant third in the election but is crying foul,
and the final judgment of the electoral process by independent observer
groups, are two of the many political uncertainties the market will have to
weigh.
'There is likely to be as much negative political news as positive in the
next months. The dedicated guys are going to be very cautious. . . but that
will be offset by those who are not playing politics' and just reacting to
the good news, said Mr Robert J Pelosky, director of Latin American research
and strategy at Morgan Stanley in New York.
Mr Pelosky said the market's leading indicator needed to 'rest and gather
strength' around the current level of 2,700 points before surging to the
expected 3,000-mark towards the end of the year.
The market rally is likely to be upheld by Mexican investors who 'are a
little more relieved, as they were not as optimistic (before the elections)
as the foreigners,' according to Mr Felix Boni, director of research at the
Mexican brokerage Interacciones. Mr Boni cited the low turnout for Mr
Cardenas as a factor not yet been completely discounted by the market.
Mr Zedillo's presidential victory also increases the likelihood that Mexico
will receive an investment-grade rating, although there is 'no rush,'
according to one credit-risk analyst. 'Let Zedillo get inaugurated and form
a government. Then we ought to be able to go ahead,' he said.
An investment-grade rating from the likes of Moody's and Standard &amp; Poors is
considered key for the infrastructure drive Mr Zedillo has promised, as it
would lower the price of a slew of government bonds expected to be issued in
the early days of a new government by the country's development banks and
agencies.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Washington bank settles loan bias case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Department of Justice yesterday settled a loan discrimination case
against a Washington bank which had refused to open branches in black
majority areas, setting a new standard for the siting of banks' outlets.
In the first case of its kind, Chevy Chase Federal Savings Bank of
Washington DC was charged with 'red-lining' minority areas by refusing to
open branches or market its services in them.
Although the case against Chevy Chase is not the largest case of racial
discrimination the department has brought against a lender, it considerably
broadens the legal net on the issue. In previous cases, lenders have been
accused of turning down loans for individual loan applicants because of
their race.
'To shun an entire community because of its racial make-up is just as wrong
as to reject (applicants) because they are African-American,' Ms Janet Reno,
the US attorney-general, said yesterday.
To settle the case, Chevy Chase agreed to make Dollars 140m (Pounds 90m) of
special mortgage loans available at one percentage point below the
prevailing rate in majority black areas of Washington and neighbouring
Prince George's county in Maryland. Chevy Chase will also open three
mortgage offices in black majority areas of Washington and one full bank
branch in the city's depressed Anacostia section.
Before the settlement, Chevy Chase had 78 bank branches and 20 mortgage
offices, but none was in any of the census areas in which blacks made up a
majority of the population.
'Some neighbourhood banks may turn away blacks because of their race, but
other neighbourhoods may not even have banks to which blacks can turn,' Ms
Reno said. Both the Justice Department and federal bank regulators have
stepped up efforts to enforce fair lending laws.
In one of the biggest cases, the Federal Reserve refused to allow Shawmut
National to acquire another bank because of patterns of lending bias until
Shawmut had overhauled its lending procedures and reached a settlement with
the Justice Department.
Other big banking groups on the acquisition trail, alerted by the Shawmut
case, have taken pre-emptive steps to expand their lending to minorities.
But yesterday's settlement is the first where the Justice Department pursued
denial of service to an entire area.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Senate puts off vote on Clinton crime bill: Tempers fray as
members yearn for a break
</HEADLINE>

   By GEORGE GRAHAM

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Leaders in the US Senate had to put off any vote on the administration's
crime bill yesterday, but at least began debate on the measure.
On Sunday night, the House of Representatives had voted to pass a
slimmed-down bill with somewhat less money for crime prevention programmes
than the White House wanted.
Some opponents of the legislation, led by Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of
Utah, were still threatening to use the kind of obstructive procedural
tactics that held the bill up in the House for two weeks.
Mr Leon Panetta, the White House chief of staff, said it would be 'a
disgrace to the country' if the bill's opponents were to block the measure.
Senator George Mitchell, the Democratic majority leader, said such an
attempt would be 'unwise, both substantively and politically.'
Senator Joseph Biden, who as chairman of the judiciary committee will manage
the bill in the Senate, said that he believed the bill would be 'awfully
hard to stop,' but he acknowledged that he faced a hard task in keeping
together a coalition of colleagues so as to maintain the 60 votes needed to
overcome procedural obstacles.
'My dilemma is to get virtually all the Democrats and between five and eight
Republicans,' he said.
In the final House vote on Sunday night, the bill won the backing of 188
Democrats, 46 Republicans and the lone Congressional independent, while 131
Republicans and 64 Democrats - mostly opponents of either gun control or the
death penalty - voted against it.
Ever since President Bill Clinton's stunning defeat in a procedural vote in
the House two weeks ago, the crime bill has overshadowed everything else for
the administration.
White House officials said the first question on Vice-President Al Gore's
lips, when he emerged from surgery on Sunday after injuring his Achilles
tendon in a basketball game, was: 'What's going on with the crime bill?'
Yesterday, crime pushed aside the Senate's snail-paced debate over
healthcare reform, offering some members a welcome break from an argument
that has already eaten one week out of the Congressional summer holiday.
House members, at least, were able to go home after the climactic vote on
Sunday, but Senator Mitchell says he plans to keep the Senate in Washington
until it has completed action on a healthcare reform bill, despite the
advice of Senator Daniel Moynihan, finance committee chairman, that he allow
senators to take a break.
'I will do whatever the leader wants done, but I think he might decide that
we've talked enough, and we've listened to each other enough,' he said on
Sunday.
Congressman Robert Matsui appeared unimpressed by the Senate's feeling that
it needed a rest.
'It's not as much a problem for them. As you know, they have older kids
because they're older people,' he said.
But, with tempers fraying on all sides, Mr Mitchell and Mr Clinton may
conclude that, if they can bring the crime bill to passage, they would be
better to leave the healthcare reform bill to one last, convulsive effort in
September.
That may leave very little time to complete the measure before members start
fretting to go home to campaign for re-election in November.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tajikistan's remote Pamir mountains were once a favourite hunting spot for
Moscow's leaders, who prized the Soviet southeast's bighorn Marco Polo
sheep. These days, however, Russians in the Central Asia republic are as
likely as not themselves to feel like the hunted.
Late last week, seven Russian soldiers were killed in a fierce cross-border
raid in Tajikistan by a more and more daring, Afghanistan-based opposition.
The deaths followed an intense period of assassinations and ambushes against
a 25,000-strong Russian military force deployed on the southern Tajikistan
border with Afghanistan.
The force, sent ostensibly to prevent the republic's instability from
spreading to Russia, has become increasingly bogged down and besieged.
'This (the attack) is a reflection of the opposition's existing strength,
and partly its desperation,' said a diplomat in Dushanbe, interviewed by
telephone yesterday. 'We haven't seen the full fury yet.'
In committing itself to propping up the Dushanbe government, composed of old
guard hard-liners from the previous Communist administration, Moscow has
said it is fighting a radical Islamic opposition, and the regional
reverberations that could erupt if it came to power.
Western analysts believe that the opposition's Islamic component has been
exaggerated. Moscow may be sensitive about a new war being fought on former
Soviet territory against forces in Afghanistan.
But, analysts say, the deployment is also part of a wider policy in which
Russia, while loosening up elsewhere, has entrenched itself in all the
Central Asian and Caucasus republics that it has dominated for more than a
century.
Rather than a battle against militant Islam, the Russian troops have become
tangled in a two-year-old power struggle between regional clans, intractable
disputes that go back to the beginning of the Soviet era. The battle pits
the former Soviet elite against an opposition of traditional have-nots from
the rural Garm and Pamir areas in central and eastern Tajikistan.
The fighting began as a purely political struggle in the last months of the
Soviet period, when the government loosened its grip on the opposing
opinions.
In the ensuing months, the neo-Communist government found itself
increasingly beleaguered by a growing opposition coalition comprising
intellectuals, self-described democrats, Islamic leaders and students.
In autumn 1992, the opposition took power. But within weeks it was
overthrown by tanks, jets and troops provided by Moscow and neighbouring
Uzbekistan.
Some 60,000 Garm and Pamir people fled across the Amu Darya River to
Afghanistan when the elite unleashed an ethnic-cleansing campaign in which
thousands died. More than 30,000 refugees remain across the Amu Darya, among
whom are the fighters who today dog the Russians.
The fighting, and the attacks against the Russians, look unlikely to end
soon. A principal reason is regional politics. Afghanistan, Iran and
Uzbekistan are all in the fray with Russia.
Russia's support for Mr Imamali Rakhmanov, the Tajikistan president, remains
the most important element of Tajik politics. In exchange for Russia's
assistance, Mr Rakhmanov has allowed Moscow to control his economy and
military. It is hard to name any important policy or programme that is Mr
Rakhmanov's own.
But the region's other players have made Moscow's role ever more dangerous.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Tokyo thoughts turn to political weddings: Japanese parties
may make their trial marriages more permanent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the eighth week of their cohabitation, the unlikely political bedfellows
of the Japanese government are getting along well enough to push general
election prospects a year away or more. There is even stray talk of a more
permanent arrangement.
The government is headed by Mr Tomiichi Murayama of the Social Democratic
party, the country's first socialist prime minister since 1947, but the main
ministerial posts are occupied by conservatives from the Liberal Democratic
party which had run Japan for more than four decades until last summer.
The two parties are traditional adversaries. But Mr Koichi Kato, the LDP
policy chief, has been quoted as saying that his party should hold talks
with the SDP's trade union backers to achieve a merger.
Strictly, the current arrangement is a menage a trois, with the New
Harbinger party, run by Mr Masayoshi Takemura, now stuck awkwardly in the
middle of the two much older parties. In the absence of an early break-up,
the next election will be fought in new constituency boundaries, and latest
political arithmetic suggests that a formal LDP-SDP combine would be best
placed to fight it.
Such a move would also be intended to counter the creation of an opposition
super-party which has been proposed among recent LDP defectors and members
of the minority coalition which was ousted at the end of June.
Both merger ideas reflect the introduction, under a system of state
political funding to replace the previous discredited quest for corporate
and other donations, of rules which entitle large parties to more campaign
funds from central coffers than would be obtained by a loose grouping of
smaller political units.
Neither political wedding will necessarily be rushed, if held at all.
A consultative council linking nine opposition groupings is due to be formed
early next month. But many opposition MPs are wary of any closer involvement
with Mr Ichiro Ozawa, chief strategist of the Japan Renewal party, whose
perceived high-handedness in dealings with coalition partners contributed to
the fall in June of the government led by Mr Tsutomu Hata.
Mr Ozawa will remain co-leader of the JRP along with Mr Hata after the party
last week rejected his offer to step down.
The Rengo trade union confederation is less than happy with the direction
taken by the SDP, and a number of union activists are calling for Rengo to
establish its own party.
As a whole, however, the Japanese public is coming round to the apparently
unususal idea of a left-right combination. Approval ratings for the Murayama
cabinet have risen from a low base since it won office to around 35 per cent
now.
The policy issues of the day have so far given rise to no publicly expressed
discord.
The LDP and SDP have common interests to protect:
Agricultural subsidies, as each relies significantly on the rural vote. The
gradual opening of the country's rice market will not mean that those who
farm the staple will receive any less government money this year, keeping
consumer costs high.
Public sector jobs, where the LDP has an influential constituency among
bureaucrats, and the SDP is backed by many lower-ranking staff.
Deregulation, the catchcry of the past two governments, has suddenly slipped
out of daily use.
Lifetime employment in the private sector, so that jobless figures do not
rise as the recession draws to a close. The LDP's Mr Shizuka Kamei, the
transport minister, this month slapped down a plan by the big three airlines
to hire new staff on short-term contracts, and dissent came from the
business community alone.
The only issue which has caused difficulties is one dating back 49 years. As
Mr Murayama sets off for Manila today at the start of an eight-day
South-East Asian tour, no consensus has emerged on how to atone for Japan's
wartime misdeeds.
On his visit to the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore he may come
bearing little except expressions of remorse.
LDP officials are still having difficulty coming to terms with the past. Mr
Shin Sakurai resigned as environment minister a week ago after suggesting
that Asian countries had benefited from Japanese occupation.
Following talks last night with coalition leaders, it was still uncertain
whether Mr Murayama would be in a position to tell Philippine President
Fidel Ramos of a plan to set up a Y100bn (Pounds 656m) private foundation.
This would provide, among others, for the so-called comfort women who were
forced to provide sex for imperial army troops during the second world war.
Tensions persist within the parliamentary LDP, defections from which brought
about its downfall last summer.
An LDP committee is debating whether to abolish the intra-party factions,
which have traditionally served as powerful lines of patronage. Many party
elders will dislike the proposal.
Mr Murayama has, meanwhile, still to complete the post-Cold War conversion
of his own party. An SDP congress next month is likely to highlight
grassroots concerns.
But the leap over the ideological threshold to share house with the LDP is
supported, according to one poll, by a comfortable majority of regional SDP
leaders.

FT  23 AUG 94 / S Korea's economy 'to grow 8.3%'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON and AP
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Korea's economy is expected to grow 8.3 per cent in 1994, but will
slow slightly to a rate of 7.6 per cent next year, according to the
state-funded Korea Development Institute, the country's leading economic
policy group.
The buoyant figures for gross national product represent a recovery after
two years of sluggish growth: 4.7 per cent in 1992 and 5.6 per cent in 1993,
the lowest in more than a decade.
Renewed growth is based on higher exports, which have risen 12.9 per cent
during the first seven months of 1994, as demand increases in the
industrialised world and the Korean won weakens against the strong Japanese
yen.
The export boom has fuelled industrial investments in plant expansion as
production capacity becomes strained, with the operation ratio for
manufacturing companies reaching 83.3 per cent in June. Total industrial
investments are expected to rise 72 per cent for the year, according to
Barings Securities in Seoul.
But the healthy economic growth is creating new problems for South Korea in
terms of a current account deficit and inflation.
Korea's dependence on imports of Japanese components and machinery, coupled
with the strong Japanese yen, is likely to increase its trade deficit with
Tokyo to at least Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.6bn) this year from Dollars 8.5bn
in 1993.
This will contribute to a current account deficit of Dollars 2.1bn for the
year, despite increased capital inflows as Korea gradually opens its
financial markets. The economic recovery is also increasing inflationary
pressure, with prices threatening to exceed the government's inflation
target of 6 per cent this year.
Analysts worry that higher interest rates caused by rising credit demand and
tighter monetary controls imposed by the government to curb inflation will
cut short the economic recovery.
The Korea Development Institute proposes that the government cut its budget
and raise taxes to prevent the economy overheating, as an alternative to
strict control of money supply. This would avoid the mistakes in the early
1990s, when a government-ordered credit squeeze led to the period of low
growth in 1992-93.
None the less, a rise in interest rates appears inevitable because of credit
demand. Higher financial costs and the gradual appreciation of the Korean
won against the US dollar will be the main factors behind the slowdown in
GNP growth next year.
The South Korean and US military began war simulation exercises yesterday,
the Defence Ministry said, AP reports from Seoul. The annual 'Ulji-Focus
Lens' exercises began despite North Korea's threats last week that the war
games would strain inter-Korean relations.
The exercise tests the combat capabilities of the joint forces, even though
no actual troop movements are involved. Under computer simulation, the
650,000-member South Korean forces and 36,000 US troops face off against
North Korea.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Nigerian oil strike turmoil continues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Further oil output losses and the continued closure of the main commercial
banks yesterday hindered Nigeria's military regime in breaking the six-week
oil strike and getting the economy back to normal.
Anglo-Dutch Shell, which operates about half Nigeria's 2m b/d oil industry,
announced yesterday the temporary closure of its Forcados terminal, which
exports 500,000 b/d.
Shell has not disclosed how much of the other 500,000 b/d produced at its
Bonny Terminal is being lost because of political strikes by the two oil
workers' unions, Nupeng and Pengassan, aimed at installing jailed opposition
leader Mr Moshood Abiola as president.
The price of the benchmark Brent Blend for October fell to Dollars 15.75 in
late London trading yesterday, 60 cents down on Friday's close. Mr Don
Etiebet, oil minister, said many oil workers had reported to work. But oil
officials said it was too early to say if the strike had been broken.
Mr Aminu Saleh, secretary to the government, warned banks yesterday that
unless they opened by tomorrow he would 'review their licences'. The big
commercial banks, all privatised last year, hold most of the banks'
deposits; for the government to close them would paralyse the system.
The banks joined yesterday in the latest auction of foreign exchange in
which Dollars 100m will be sold. The acute shortage of foreign currency in
Nigeria has cut the auctions from fortnightly to one a month.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Adoring press turns blind eye to Deng's birthday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China's official media went into overdrive yesterday in praise of Mr Deng
Xiaoping, the country's senior leader who turned 90; but nowhere in
thousands of characters published about the ailing and reclusive Mr Deng was
any mention made of his birthday.
People's Daily, the Communist party newspaper, led a chorus of praise in a
front-page editorial which described Mr Deng as 'the general designer of our
country's socialist reforms, opening and construction of a modern society.
'We should read comrade Deng Xiaoping's works carefully, attentively and
repeatedly,' the paper said.
China's media gave more weight and prominence to Mr Deng's contribution to
the country's reform effort this year than in previous years.
Western officials attributed this to a recognition that Mr Deng may not have
much longer to live, and to his reaching the 'round figure' of 90.
Mr Deng's remarkable life, which began in a remote county in China's
south-west Sichuan province, spanned an era of great turbulence in Chinese
history. As a leader of the communist revolution, he was at the centre of
stirring events for more than half a century.
No mention was made in the Chinese press yesterday of Mr Deng's whereabouts
on his birthday: it is assumed he is in Beijing since he is now too feeble
to enjoy his favourite summer pastime of swimming in the sea at a beach
resort east of the capital.
The blanket media coverage of Mr Deng's achievements, with its emphasis on
his historical contribution, appeared to be preparing the ground for
'canonisation' on his death as one of the giants of modern Chinese history.
'Our party's flag, having been inscribed with 'Marxism and Leninism' and
'Mao Zedong Thought', is now enhanced by 'Deng Xiaoping's theory of Building
Socialism with Chinese characteristics',' People's Daily commented.
'The 19th century was the one during which the Chinese nation declined, the
20th century was one when the Chinese nation fought and strove and the 21st
century will be the one when the Chinese nation will be revitalised fully,'
the paper added.
Apart from newspaper commentaries, Mr Deng's birthday was also marked by
photographic exhibitions and examples of his calligraphy. China's senior
leader may have been out of sight on his birthday, but the Chinese
propaganda machine has not allowed him to be out of mind.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Taiwan raises stakes in poll fraud battle: A look at
vote-buying tactics for December elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Taiwan yesterday raised the reward for information leading to vote fraud
convictions to Dollars 385,000 (Pounds 256,000) in an effort to keep pace
with the spiralling costs of electioneering Taiwan -style.
In a bid to stamp out myriad ingenious vote-buying schemes ahead of December
3 elections for Taiwan provincial governor, provincial assembly members and
Taipei and Kaohsiung mayors, Mr Ma Ying-jeou, justice minister, said
officials would shortly begin monitoring candidates and gathering evidence.
'We will have to come up with detailed plans because many candidates are
starting early, extremely early, their preparations or other illegal
methods,' Mr Ma said. 'The criminal methods used in elections change with
each passing day, and candidates are continually inventing new schemes.'
One popular method of winning voters' affections is to throw lavish banquets
at which each guest is given a present - perhaps a can of tea with TDollars
3,000-TDollars 5,000 (Pounds 73-Pounds 122) in the bottom or an expensive
watch.
At the grassroots level, aspirants to political office may give gifts such
as stoves to each family in a district. In county elections last November,
one candidate held a county-wide lottery which was actually a disguised
vote-buying scheme.
While Mr Ma himself is considered above reproach, some viewed the ruling
Kuomintang's reward offers as a case of the fox guarding the henhouse. 'Only
the KMT can really buy votes,' said one observer. 'Not only does it have the
money, but it has the party machine. It has the on-the-ground administration
to get the names, addresses, telephone numbers and background of each
family.'
Mr Ma launched a high-profile anti-corruption campaign in 1993 and is
credited with the arrest of 341 out of 883 councillors elected early this
year.
Buying votes is estimated to have a 30 to 40 per cent overall effectiveness
rate. In cities people are wont to take the cash and vote as they please,
but in the countryside people have a higher standard of 'ethics' and thus
seven or eight out of 10 people will vote for the candidate who bought their
vote.
Observers doubted that vote fraud could be obliterated in part because such
activities are often legally ambiguous, and in part because giving hungpao -
red envelopes, or gifts - is so thoroughly ingrained in Taiwanese culture.
Most people do not regard such practices as corruption but rather as a
gesture of respect on the part of the candidate. After all, it is
troublesome to take time out to go to the polls.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Vietnam admits an equality gap: Central Committee calls for
faster industrialisation and modernisation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Vietnam's ruling Communist party has admitted what economists say could be
the biggest threat facing the country's recent rapid economic growth: a
yawning gap between the urban and the rural economy.
A resolution issued by the party's Central Committee calls for faster
'industrialisation and modernisation', a catchphrase reflecting growing
concern over the country's ability to reach the ambitious target of doubling
per capita income by 2000.
The phrase is understood to mean an increased emphasis on developing
Vietnam's state manufacturing sector, much of which has limped along on
dwindling state subsidies since economic openness, or doi moi (renovation),
was officially sanctioned in 1986.
The emphasis appears to be on attracting the country's vast rural workforce
into the sector.
The resolution added that Vietnam was now facing 'acute difficulties'
because of low economic growth, loose control of inflation, limited funding
sources and increased competition, reflecting increased candour in the way
policymakers are dealing with the country's progress to a market economy.
Keen to avoid the chaos that engulfed many of the former eastern bloc
countries' attempts at fast-track private-sector growth, Vietnam's leaders
are steering policy towards placing crucial state industries into commanding
positions in the economy while encouraging foreign investment and
private-sector growth.
Despite an impressive list of economic achievements, including attracting
Dollars 9.5bn (Pounds 6.1bn) in foreign investment in the past five years
and sharply reducing inflation, the results of economic reform have so far
been felt mainly in the capital, Hanoi, and the southern industrial centre
Ho Chi Minh City.
In both cities, a growing class of new rich is enjoying increasing spending
power. But they account for only 20 per cent of the population. The rest are
still locked into the farm sector, where unemployment is increasing. 'The
real issue is to get people out of the agricultural sector and into
industry,' a Washington-based official at the World Bank's agricultural
division said.
Local press reports say that last year industry accounted for only about 20
per cent of gross national product.
Figures released last month by the country's national statistical bureau
disclosed rapid growth in foreign trade but also a budget deficit of about
Dollars 200m as imports have overtaken exports.
Although national per capita income is often quoted as Dollars 220, many
economists agree that it would be more realistic to make a distinction
between Ho Chi Minh City, where the figure is unofficially put at about
Dollars 500, and the countryside, where the figure of Dollars 220 is said to
be more accurate.
The Central Committee's resolution said Vietnam must create the conditions
necessary for private business to invest in production and joint ventures
and co-operation with the state-owned economic sector.
'We must continue to renovate economic policies, especially the financial
and monetary policies, in order better to create, mobilise and effectively
use capital, and to strive to increase gross investment accumulation rate to
around 25-30 per cent of the country's GDP,' the resolution said.
Only two months ago, in his closing speech to the National Assembly, the
country's rubber-stamp legislative body, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet began
his remarks by dwelling more on what the economy had failed to achieve than
the usual glowing catalogue of achievements.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Ex-prisoner challenges HK election law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Lau San-ching, a 41-year-old social worker, has thrown an embarrassing
spanner into the workings of Hong Kong's first set of fully democratic
elections.
Earlier this month his application to stand for the coming District Board
Elections was rejected on the grounds that he was not 'ordinarily resident'
in Hong Kong for the 10 years preceding the election, as stipulated under
the colony's electoral laws.
Mr Lau, who was yesterday granted leave to appeal against the returning
officer's decision, spent much of the past 10 years in China as a political
prisoner. His absence from Hong Kong was not voluntary, but puts him in the
same category as those who have gone overseas to study or work.
In an open letter to Ms Anson Chan, acting governor during the absence of Mr
Chris Patten, the governor, Mr Lau wrote: 'It is not just a twist of fate
that I found myself spending 10 of the best years of my life in a Chinese
jail. . . Instead of following the trendy pursuit of money, power and fame,
I discovered that my calling in life was in the establishment of democracy,
respect for human rights, and restoration of law and order in China. It was
with these objectives that I clashed with the Chinese authority; this
eventually resulted in loss of my freedom for 10 years.'
The government is adamant that the rule of law must apply. 'We have rule of
law here, and if people want to challenge that, we have an independent
judiciary. Bureaucrats and politicians have to make decisions based on the
law, taking legal advice where necessary, and that's what we have done in
this case,' a government official said.
Further, the government believes that even assuming any amendments to the
electoral laws were necessary, these should not be made while an election is
going on as that would be unfair: any change will bring potential losers as
well as potential gainers.
The appeal hearing on Friday may change that: yesterday's leave to appeal
was supplemented with a pledge to do everything to put Mr Lau's candidature
on a level footing with his fellow contestants, who will have a head start
in their campaigning.
Mr Lau's lawyers are arguing over the interpretation of 'ordinarily
resident'. During his involuntary stay in China, he kept his home address in
Hong Kong; he did not rent a flat or take a hotel room in China; and he
returned to Hong Kong immediately on his release.
His lawyers will claim the residency rule is against the Bill of Rights,
which grants every permanent resident the right and opportunity of access to
public service in Hong Kong without distinction on the basis of race, sex,
political opinion or any other prejudice.
They will also attempt to prove a more complex legal point - that those who
drafted the residency clause did not have legal power to make such a
requirement. There is no such requirement in Britain.
The district board elections, on September 18, will mark the first time all
346 seats go up for direct election.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Australia drops plan to privatise shipping line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Australia's federal government yesterday ditched plans to privatise the
Australian National Line (ANL), claiming the state-owned shipping line was
in a poor financial state and would not attract any buyer interest.
Mr Laurie Brereton, transport minister, said the decision was supported by a
private report, conducted by Salomon Brothers Australia and Price
Waterhouse, for the government.
'I don't see privatisation as being in any way a realistic proposition
either now or in the foreseeable (future),' he commented.
While ANL has been consistently loss-making in recent years, the move also
has heavy political overtones.
The Labor government's current privatisation plans, which encompass the sale
of the remaining 75 per cent stake in Qantas, the international airline, and
the 22 Commonwealth airports run by the Federal Airports Corporation, have
been coming under heavy attack from left-wing sections of the party.
This issue is widely expected to dominate the Australian Labor Party's
national conference to be held in Hobart next month.
But by making concessions now over the ANL privatisation, the government may
consider its prospects of pushing through the airports sale will be
enhanced.
The government first mooted the sale of 49 per cent of the shipping line
business in 1991.

FT  23 AUG 94 / World Trade News: EU toughens stance on Turkish trade ties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ISTANBUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union is toughening its stance in negotiations with Turkey on a
customs union, indicating it may cancel the date for implementation if
progress on legislative reform is not made.
Turkey is due to enter the customs union - lowering its trade barriers to EU
goods to zero and adopting the Union's common external tariff - on January 1
1996.
However in a move strongly opposed by the Turks, Brussels has now thrown in
an additional review date - September 1995 - giving the EU an effective last
minute opt-out of the negotiations.
Commission officials insist the ball is in Turkey's court. The EU opened its
markets to Turkish industrial products in 1973. However, Turkey has still
got some way to go to cut tariffs and adopt legislation that will bring
trade and industrial policy into line with that of the EU.
A customs union is an important step to closer ties with Europe, first
envisaged in the Ankara agreement of 1963, and Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime
minister, has made it one of her key policy targets. The next few weeks will
decide whether or not the two sides can narrow their differences.
Mrs Ciller sent a 'white paper' to all government departments in May
outlining the conditions and timetable to be met.
In early September, the EU Council is expected to give its endorsement to a
framework work programme to complete the customs union.
However, commission officials warn there is considerable work to be done
before foreign ministers of the Turkish-EU Association Council can meet in
December to give the final go-ahead.
Turkey is currently engaged in an economic structural adjustment effort,
under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund.
There is some concern that difficulties in fulfilling the IMF's standby
agreement could hinder the reforms needed to put a customs union in place.
The Fund is due to make its first review of progress in the second week in
November.
The main EU concern is that Turkey's parliament may have problems approving
legislation in critical areas such as intellectual property rights,
industrial and competition policy.
There are still a number of key points of disagreement:
During a visit in February, Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade commissioner, warned
that if a competition policy in line with the EU's was not in place and
operating, the EU's anti-dumping provisions, which Turkey wants lifted,
would be retained beyond the customs union implementation.
Turkey wants the quotas lifted on textiles, Turkey's largest export earner
with around Dollars 5.3bn of sales in 1993, 70 per cent of which went to EU
markets. However, the EU is under pressure from Spain and Portugal, who are
wary of increased Turkish textile shipments to the Union.
On technical standards, Turkey wants both sides to adopt the principle of
mutual recognition, while the EU calls for Turkey to adopt the EU code.
Perhaps the most contentious issue is that of financial co-operation, which
Turkey maintains the EU is obliged to provide as part of the original Ankara
accords.
The EU appears amenable to some form of financial support, but wants the
issue treated separately from the customs union negotiations.

FT  23 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Turkey grapples with a looming power
shortage - The Dollars 1.3bn promised for the energy sector may be in doubt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turkish energy policy is back on the front burner, as the authorities
grapple with the prospect that the country could face a power shortage as
early as the start of 1996.
Turkey confronts an awkward dilemma - how to invest in new capacity while
adhering to the foreign debt ceilings envisaged under the economic standby
agreement with the International Monetary Fund.
Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister, earlier promised to allocate Dollars
1.3bn for the energy sector under the 1994 investment programme, although in
the wake of the current austerity measures the fate of that undertaking is
unclear.
Mrs Ciller is also pushing ahead with plans to privatise Tek, the state-run
utility.
Last September, the government submitted a decree dividing Tek into two
separate public companies, comprising the transmission and generation
businesses (Teas) and Tedas, the distribution unit. During the first stage
the government plans to privatise 10 lignite-fired power plants, starting
with the Afsin-Elbistan plant.
But, however much the government is able to stick to its IMF programme and
turn around the economy, if the country suffers power cuts the recovery
could be nipped in the bud.
According to a study by the energy ministry, Turkey needs to build 187 power
plant units by 2010 to meet electricity demand of 308bn KWh, compared with
71.7bn KWh in 1993. Total energy investment is estimated at Dollars 32bn
over the next 10 years, two thirds of which will be in power plant, and the
rest in distribution and transmission lines and resource development.
Energy experts say Turkey will need 1m kW additional capacity every year to
meet the demand to the turn of the century and 2m kW annually after that
date.
The energy ministry has drawn up plans for 24 lignite fired units, with
total generating capacity of 9.785m kWh; 27 natural gas fired units
generating 12.150m kWh; 21 coal-fired plants, with 10.5m kWh; 2 nuclear
power plants with 2.132m kWh and 113 hydro-electric units with capacity of
14.4m KWh of electric energy.
The plan represents significant opportunities for foreign companies wishing
to supply generation equipment.
In Turkey, the only locally manufactured equipment are hydraulic type
turbines for power units of up to 60,000 KW, and small boilers and
generators. In 1993, an estimated 90 per cent of the Dollars 360m spent on
electrical equipment was imported from foreign companies. An industry report
by the US embassy in February, estimated that equipment demand would grow by
9 per cent over the next 3 years.
Turkey's main constraint is finance, at a time when access to debt markets
has been closed by downgradings by US credit rating agencies.
One possible solution is Build Operate and Transfer (BOT) private projects,
which can be used to fund large scale public infrastructure without
affecting the country's debt profile. First championed by the former Turkish
president Turgut Ozal, BOT schemes allow private developers to recover their
costs for building a plant through operating it for a fixed period, before
handing it back to the state.
The argument in favour of BOT schemes is that they encourage project
discipline, in that the financial risks are taken by the developer, rather
than the state, and that project over-runs delay the start of the
developer's recovery of costs. The one grey area is what happens when for
reasons beyond the developer's control the project has to be abandoned.
The government is considering proposals from a number of consortia. Enron of
the UK and the Wing Group, the small US power developer, are in partnership
on a Dollars 600m dual fired gas and oil plant at Marmara Ereglisi, east of
Istanbul.
A consortium led by ABB, the Swiss-Swedish power giant, is considering a
similar scheme for the Marmara region. Trinity Partners have proposed a
coal-fired plant in Anatolia.
Meanwhile, Philipp Holzmann of Germany is negotiating terms for a
hydro-electric power station on the Euphrates river at Birecik, in eastern
Turkey, near the Syrian border. In total the BOT proposals represent some
10m KW of new capacity.' There is a greet need for these projects,' says Mr
John Wing of the Wing Group.
But all three Turkish BOT projects have met resistance from Tek, whose role
the private developers will replace.
The Enron-Wing consortium has linked up with Midland, the privatised UK
utility, to deal with the 'operating' part of the franchise, a pattern
repeated by a number of the UK's privatised utilities as the new companies
seek to maximise their 'unregulated' profits. It has also signed an energy
supply contract with Botas, the gas pipeline company.
However, the real sticking point is over the payment obligations of Tek,
which will take the power produced by the project. The consortium wants the
treasury to guarantee these amounts. There is also some concern over what
would happen in the event that Tek is privatised.

FT  23 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Oil companies 'using older tankers'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many of the world's largest oil companies are continuing to charter very old
tankers despite concerns about the threat old vessels pose to the
environment.
Tanker owners also appear to be cutting down on maintenance and repair work.
These findings emerged from two surveys carried out for the International
Association of Independent Tanker Owners (Intertanko).
The surveys looked at the age profile of chartered supertankers, vessels of
more than 200,000 tonnes, and at the time tankers spent undergoing repair in
dry dock.
The Kuwait Petroleum Company topped the list of large charterers using
vessels with an average age of 18 years followed by Total, the French group,
with an average of 17 years.
British Petroleum and Exxon used chartered fleet which was on average 16
years old. The average age of supertankers chartered by all companies in the
first seven months of 1994 was 14 years with Shell, the Anglo-Dutch group,
employing vessels with an average age of 13 years and Mobil of the US using
a fleet of 12 years.
All of the top 10 charterers were prepared to use individual vessels up to
20 years old, frequently a time when the need for significant repairs
emerges and owners decide to sell or scrap.
But fears that the increasing age of the world tanker fleet in itself poses
a higher risk of oil spills and environmental damage does not appear to be
born out despite insurance industry pressure to levy higher premiums on
older ships.
Commenting on the survey findings, leading oil companies said age was only
one factor they took into account.
'We carry out regular positive vetting,' BP said. 'You can have a
three-year-old ship which has not been maintained as well as an 18-year-old
vessel.'
Exxon said it would be chartering newly built tankers over the next two
years, but emphasised that it assessed 'a ship's condition, history, owner,
operating practices and management. We don't exclude a ship solely because
of its age.'
But the increasing average age of the world tanker fleet and stricter
controls should have led to a rise in the number of tankers undergoing
upgrading and repair in dry dock, Intertanko said.
Yet only 300 tankers entered dock in the first half of 1994 compared with
nearly 900 in the whole of 1991. They spent on average 22 days in dock
compared with 26 days in 1992.
Owners appear to be delaying work because of financial pressures, Intertanko
said.

FT  23 AUG 94 / German Federal Elections (October 16): Red Socks aim to get
a foot in the German parliament's door - A look the poll prospects of the
east's ex-communists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Herta Plache had just started on her 3,560th tiny red woollen sock, the
symbol - and the nickname - of Germany's Party for Democratic Socialism
(PDS). The successor to east Germany's former communist party has become the
repository for many east Germans' hopes. Still more important, it could end
up holding the balance of power in the Bundestag after October's general
election.
Mrs Plache, 83, knits six socks a day. Then she gives them to Neues
Deutschland, once east Germany's communist party daily newspaper and now the
region's main left-wing daily, with a circulation of 135,000 copies. 'The
paper sells the socks to PDS supporters,' she says, sitting in her small
apartment in east Berlin. 'I've been doing it since 1990. It is my small
contribution to the PDS.'
She is one of the 130,000 paid-up PDS members in eastern Germany who hope
the party will win at least three seats, the minimum required to enter the
Bundestag in October.
That prospect is being taken seriously in Bonn. Chancellor Helmut Kohl sees
the PDS as the bogeyman of the election. His party, the Christian Democratic
Union (CDU), and its senior coalition partner, the Bavarian Christian Social
Union (CSU), have issued constant warnings about the return of the communist
threat in the guise of the Rote Socken - the red socks.
Mrs Plache claims the established political parties in Bonn 'are doing
everything in their power to discredit us. They accuse us of wanting a
return to the old communist system. This is not true'. Criticism of the PDS
intensified after the elections in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt last
June when, after winning 20 per cent of the vote, the party lent its support
to a minority Social Democratic/Green coalition and ousted the CDU.
If it wins seats in parliament, this episode shows how the party could play
a pivotal role in helping determine who will govern in Bonn.
Recent opinion polls give the CDU a lead of 9 percentage points over the
Social Democrats (SPD), but it is taking no chances. The party's main
concern is that support for the PDS could usher in an SPD/Green coalition on
the Saxony-Anhalt model by helping to dislodge CDU governments in
forthcoming state elections in Saxony, Thuringia, and
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
The SPD and the Greens repeated yesterday that they would not form a
minority government tolerated by the PDS even if such a coalition would let
them oust Mr Kohl in October. Yet the possibility that this outcome could
emerge has become one of the main political talking points in Germany.
In pre-election jousting in east germany, one of the PDS's main advantages
is that it
inherited the old party structures of the former communists, or Socialist
Unity party (SED), and some of the membership.
'Our strength lies in our grassroots organisation,' says Mr Lothar Bisky, a
leading member. Ninety per cent of all PDS members are former SED
card-carriers. However, more than two-thirds of members are over the age of
60.
Reflecting their long-term contacts with the regions in which they are
based, most PDS activists are well-known locally. By contrast, many CDU and
SPD activists, originally sent into eastern Germany to build up local
organisations, have since returned to the west, leaving the local parties in
disarray.
'The service the PDS provides is invaluable and we all know them,' said Mrs
Plache. 'They help me fill out the endless bureaucratic forms. . . . Above
all, they protect our interests.'
In east Berlin, for example, the PDS has campaigned against a decision by
the cash-strapped government of Berlin to scrap public transport subsidies
for pensioners. 'None of the other parties bothered to help save this cheap
travel for us. They don't understand our problems,' added Mrs Plache. Her
monthly rent of DM646 (Pounds 271) - DM98 before unification - swallows up
two-thirds of her monthly pension.
Representing the interests of the east Germans is one of the main planks of
the PDS election campaign. Mr Otto Theel, elected mayor of Neuruppin in
Brandenburg last December, says he won because 'I am one of them. I
understood their problems thrown up by unification'.
He believes west German politicians do not understand the difficulties
caused for east Germans by higher rents, privatisation of the housing stock,
or the closure of local child care centres.
Many politicians from the established German parties believe the PDS
represents the voice of the disaffected, and hope it will disappear once a
self-sustaining economic upswing materialises in the east. However, a study
by Berlin's Free University indicates that this protest vote may be around
for some time. Many PDS members who are on low incomes or unemployed, or
have taken early retirement, are likely to remain dissatisfied with
post-unity conditions for a lengthy period.
Mr Gregor Gysi, one of the party's leading members, wants to transform it
into a modern social democratic party to represent the east German
population who feel they have no voice in united Germany. It will not be an
easy task.
The PDS is far from a monolithic, disciplined party of the old SED days. The
grassroots comprise the Communist Platform splinter group, die-hard Marxists
who reject the capitalist system, and which in turn provide easy prey for
CDU's attacks on the party. Mr Gysi cannot yet rein in this section of the
party - he needs them to help organise locally. The outcome of the federal
elections might give him the chance to modernise it.
'If we get our three seats in the Bundestag, it will give us the clout and
the authority to help us redefine the future direction of the PDS,' says Mr
Bisky. 'The end of the cold war does not mean the end of the left here, or
in eastern Europe, as recent elections in Poland and Hungary have shown.
Maybe Bonn would wish otherwise. But the trends in post-communist countries
suggest that voters want a stake in the changes brought about by the
collapse of the communist era. Above all they want a voice to represent
their interests. I hope the PDS is that voice.'

FT  23 AUG 94 / Italian president defends central bank

<TEXT>
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro of Italy yesterday defended the country's
central bank against what he described as 'forms of aggression' by members
of the Italian government after it raised two key interest rates nearly two
weeks ago.
Speaking to journalists at the forum for central European heads of
government in Alpbach, Austria, Mr Scalfaro said 'everyone, beginning with
the people in government, must respect (the bank's) autonomy'.
Mr Scalfaro did not name the Bank of Italy's critics yesterday, but he
reminded them that the central bank's independence provided 'security for
everyone'.
Tension between some members of the government and the Bank of Italy has
increased since the bank decided to raise interest rates by half a point to
defend the Italian currency against the effects of squabbling within the
coalition. Instead of strengthening the lira, however, there was a further
decline in its value against the D-Mark.
Members of the extreme right National Alliance, one of three main coalition
partners, also attacked the central bank last week for allegedly interfering
in the proposed merger between Banca Nazionale delle Communicazioni -
controlled by the Italian state railways - and San Paolo di Torino, one of
the country's biggest banks. Other National Alliance members have threatened
Mr Antonio Fazio, the central bank governor, with court action, and accused
the bank of misusing funds.
Mr Publio Fiori, the National Alliance transport minister, has accused the
central bank, in its role as banking supervisor, of trying to push BNC into
a merger with San Paolo, instead of considering alternative solutions which
would preserve BNC's special relationship with the state railways.
Yesterday, Mr Fiori met Mr Lamberto Dini, the treasury minister, to discuss
a possible solution to the BNC affair ahead of a board meeting called for
Saturday. According to a treasury statement, solutions could include
'varying the form of the deal'. One criticism levelled at the San Paolo
merger is that it would involve an exchange of shares, whereas a smaller
bank, Cassa di Risparmio in Bologna, has made a cash offer.
The Bank of Italy has refused to comment on the BNC affair, although sources
have strongly denied the charge of improper use of funds. Banking sources
yesterday expressed bemusement at the way in which what seemed to be a
straightforward deal between BNC and San Paolo has been blown up into an
important affair of state.

Wider and deeper co-operation was promised to counter the threat of
plutonium smuggling as German and Russian security officials concluded their
talks in Moscow yesterday.
The two sides said they would release a joint statement about what measures
could be taken as soon as both countries' leaders had approved them.
Diplomatic sources suggested the package would probably consist of a closer
exchange of intelligence information, tighter border controls and greater
financial assistance to help redirect Russia's nuclear expertise in more
peaceful directions.
Mr Bernd Schmidbauer, Germany's security co-ordinator who arrived in Moscow
with a team of nuclear experts on Saturday, held a final round of talks
yesterday morning. But Russian officials continued to deny that batches of
plutonium which had recently turned up in Germany originated in Russia
despite the claims of western experts.
Mr Sergei Stepashin, director of Russia's counter-intelligence service,
said: 'We do not have a clear answer to the question of where this plutonium
comes from.'

Greece has stepped up its deportations of tens of thousands of illegal
Albanian refugees in retaliation for Albania's trial of five ethnic Greeks.
The trial has been described as a 'parody' by Greek officials. More than
5,000 Albanians have been expelled within the past eight days. Greece says
there are over 300,000 ethnic Greeks living in Albania but Albania claims
the number is about 70,000. In a separate development, the British Helsinki
Human Rights Group has published a report which accuses the Greek government
of routinely suppressing the small Macedonian community which lives in
northern Greece.

The Swedish krona stiffened yesterday and long-term interest rates eased as
financial markets gave an initial welcome to a pledge by the opposition
Social Democratic Party to take tough action to curb fast-growing government
debt if its wins next month's general election. The markets expect the
Social Democrats, the country's biggest political party, to win the election
and had driven up interest rates and speculated against the krona in the
absence of a detailed opposition plan to stem the SKr200bn (Pounds 16.7bn)
budget deficit. The proposal unveiled on Friday evening to strengthen the
budget by SKr61bn over the next four years through a mix of tax rises and
spending cuts has been criticised as 'too little, too late' by the
centre-right government.

<TEXT>
The Moscow offices of the MMM investment fund reopened yesterday to queues
of prospective investors despite the collapse in its share price last month
and government warnings that its new 'tickets' were not valid stocks. The
tickets are not officially registered as shares and thus the government,
which warned potential investors that they would be buying nothing more than
'pretty postcards', has few legal means to prevent their sale. The MMM
offices had been closed since August 4, when tax police arrested Mr Mavrodi
on charges of tax evasion. Mr Mavrodi reversed the decision to close the
branches last week in an order issued from his prison cell. The 10,000
Russians who have signed up to buy the tickets are making a questionable
investment. The tickets are being sold for Rbs 1,515 each on the strength of
the MMM fund's promise to at some unspecified date redeem the tickets for
MMM shares at a rate of 100 tickets per share. Ticket buyers are thus
gambling that MMM shares will eventually rise to a value of Rbs151,500 each.
On the informal black market which has developed on the pavements outside
MMM branches in Moscow, shares are selling for up to Rbs9,000 and MMM
tickets are unofficially changing hands at Rbs3,000 each.

Leaders of the Chechen republic yesterday claimed that more than 30 Russian
armoured vehicles had entered their territory. Speaking on the telephone
from Grozny, the Chechen capital, Mr Ayub Satuev, the minister of the
interior, claimed that the vehicles were operated by Russian soldiers. Mr
Satuev said the equipment would be given to the Russian-backed opposition
forces, which control some Chechen territory and are trying to oust
President Dzhokhar Dudayev. Over the past month Moscow has waged a fierce
rhetorical battle against the breakaway Chechen state, whose ability to
maintain effective independence for nearly three years is seen as an
affront.
Opposition leaders, who have been handing out cash provided by the Russian
government to their supporters, have said that they plan to hold a
demonstration in Grozny, Mr Dudayev's stronghold, on Thursday. Observers
believe that the demonstration could develop into an armed showdown. The
situation has been complicated by the recent return of Mr Ruslan
Khasbulatov, the former chairman of the Russian parliament. A sworn enemy of
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and a native of Chechnya, Mr Khasbulatov is
trying to make a political comeback.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Russian debt crisis worries World Bank: Moscow considers
price freeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The World Bank began yesterday to offer Russian ministers advice on how to
resolve the country's fast-growing debt crisis amid fears that Moscow is
planning a prices freeze.
Russia's growing inter-enterprise debt, estimated by officials to exceed
Rbs90,000bn (Dollars 42bn at the market rate), is at the top of the
government's agenda and could determine the fate of Russia's fragile
economic reforms.
In a heated meeting over the weekend of the emergency government commission
convened to discuss the debt crisis one suggested solution was to freeze
wages and prices. 'A wage and price freeze is one idea that is floating
around,' said Mr Ardy Stoutjesdijk, director of the World Bank office in
Moscow, who met Russian officials yesterday.
But Mr Stoutjesdijk, who said the Russian government considered the debt
problem to be 'urgent,' advised Russian ministers not to adopt such a
strong-armed state approach.
While Russian officials and western financial institutions consider how to
resolve the debt crisis its negative effects on the Russian economy are
becoming increasingly apparent. The Russian rouble hit a new low of 2,190
roubles to the dollar in trading yesterday amid market fears that the
government will continue to bail out insolvent enterprises.
The Russian central bank announced yesterday it was cutting its three-month
refinancing rate to 130 per cent from 150 per cent, despite the rouble's
fall. It is the second rate cut this month and the seventh this year.
The new rate is effective immediately, a bank official said. The cut
continued previous policies and brought the central bank rate closer into
line with money market rates, currently around 105 per cent for three-month
cash.
The bank was also concerned about non-payments in every sector of the
economy and about falling production, the official added. 'This is a
continuation of our existing policies'.
At the meeting yesterday between Russian ministers and the World Bank, Mr
Oleg Soskovets, the deputy prime minister who heads the debt commission,
spoke out against the idea of an absolute price freeze. But, in an attack on
radical market reformers who argue that heavily indebted enterprises should
all simply be allowed to go bankrupt, Mr Soskovets criticised 'those
politicised economists who believe that the formation of a market should
occur in circumstances of total chaos'.
Mr Soskovets outlined a few immediate measures the Russian government will
take to alleviate the debt crisis. He said Russia intends to pursue 'a more
severe policy with regard to the countries of the near abroad,' a reference
to the former Soviet republics whose unpaid bills to Russia are one source
of the galloping debt.
Mr Soskovets also said that the Russian government would assume
responsibility for that portion of the debt owned by state ministries and
would help pay workers salaries, which in some factories are more than four
months late.
He also said the government might impose price ceilings on monopolist energy
suppliers and transport companies.
Mr Stoutjesdijk warns that 'there is no magic solution' to the debt crisis,
but says it is crucial that the government should avoid the mistake it made
in 1992 when Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar's bold market reforms were
sabotaged by the decision to bail out indebted enterprises.
One proposal put forward by the World Bank at yesterday's meeting was that
the Russian government develop a separate strategy to deal with that portion
of the debt - estimated at one third - owed to energy suppliers.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Economic Watch: Danish inflation falls to 2.1%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Denmark's Consumer Price Index fell 0.2 per cent in July from June, with the
year-on-year inflation rate down to 2.1 per cent, said Danmarks Statistik,
the Danish national statistics agency. Also released, the Danish current
account surplus for February to April fell to DKr5.0bn compared with a
surplus of DKr9.4bn for the same three-month period in 1993. The agency said
the decline in the current account surplus was caused by a strong rise in
imports and predicted that this trend was likely to continue.
German industrial capacity utilisation rose to 82.3 per cent in June from
80.3 in March, according to a survey by the German economics institute IFO.
The institute said it expected increased utilisation rates in the third
quarter. The rise stemmed primarily from increases in semi-finished products
and investment goods. The metals industry showed a particularly high
capacity use rate, up to 85.8 per cent in June from 81.7 in March. Dutch
consumer confidence continued to improve in August and hit its highest level
since August 1990, reported the government's Central Bureau for Statistics.
Italian consumer prices rose 0.2 per cent month on month and 3.7 per cent
year on year in July, according to unofficial data collated by the city of
Bologna.
Hungary's current account showed a deficit of Dollars 1.429bn in the first
five months of the year, reported the National Bank of Hungary. According to
preliminary calculations, the deficit increased by almost Dollars 500m in
June, which means that the deficit for the first half of the year is
expected to be Dollars 1.9bn.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Jackal's lawyer starts to hound the Elysee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
If you were a lawyer defending 'Carlos the Jackal', the alleged
international terrorist extradited from Sudan to face bombing charges in
France, it would be hard to be more controversial than your client - but
that is just what Mr Jacques Verges has just succeeded in doing.
The 'Verges affair' threatens, briefly at least, to eclipse the 'Carlos
affair', with Mr Verges accusing President Mitterrand of deciding to have
him killed in the early 1980s, a charge ignored by the Elysee and denied
yesterday by former counter-intelligence chiefs but implicitly supported on
television on Sunday night by a former anti-terrorist policeman.
Mr Verges has specialised in controversial cases, defending members of the
Algerian anti-colonial FLN movement in the early 1960s, associates of Carlos
in the early 1980s and more recently Klaus Barbie, the Nazi war criminal. He
recently wrote a book called 'An Open Letter to My Algerian Friends',
warning the Algerian authorities that, in suppressing the Islamic
fundamentalists, they were using the same oppressive tactics they had
accused their former French colonial masters of.
The variety of Mr Verges' clients certainly confused at least one foreign
intelligence agency. In recent days, the French press has cited files
unearthed from the Stasi of the former East Germany, claiming that Mr Verges
has been a go-between Carlos and France's Mauroy government in the early
1980s, a terrorist 'directly implicated' in a 1982 rocket attack on France's
Creys-Malville nuclear reactor, and an agent for the US Central Intelligence
Agency, apparently because of his defence of Barbie.
Mr Verges flatly denies the second and third charges, and describes the
first as a diversionary tactic to detract from his current defence of
Carlos, whom he has formerly accused the French government of kidnapping
from Sudan.
Saying that he did discuss the fate of Carlos' associates in the early 1980s
with senior officials of the Mauroy government, Mr Verges also claimed he
was put on a list of supposedly dangerous people for 'rapid elimination',
and that this task was given to Mr Paul Barril, whom he defended on a charge
of falsifying evidence on suspected Irish terrorists in 1982. It was Mr
Barril who said Mr Verges was 'a priority target' for the French
authorities.
Meanwhile, a senior Sudanese official told the French press over the weekend
that the extradition of Carlos was a 'model of co-operation' between the two
countries. Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, was yesterday more
circumspect about relations with Sudan, which he said was conducting 'an
extraordinarily bloody war' against its south and was 'sometimes' suspected
of harbouring terrorists. However, the minister said there was no hidden
'counterpart' in the Carlos extradition, such as Iranian pressure on
Khartoum in gratitude for France's return of two suspected Iranian
terrorists to Tehran last year.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Millions of victims of Stalinist repression could be compensated for their
confiscated property as Russia continues to exorcise the trauma of its
Soviet past, writes John Thornhill. According to the Itar-Tass newsagency,
the Russian government has passed a resolution promising to reimburse
innocent victims of repression either by returning their original property
or paying the cash equivalent. Details remain sketchy and the complications
of implementing such a plan are vast. It is also likely that approval would
first be needed from President Boris Yeltsin. The scheme would certainly
open up a Pandora's box of highly-emotional claims. During Stalin's 30-year
rule, many millions were persecuted, including whole ethnic groups.

FT  23 AUG 94 / CDU threatens to penalise unemployed who refuse to accept
'reasonable' jobs
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Days before the formal launch of its election manifesto, Germany's governing
Christian Democrat Union (CDU) yesterday said it would reduce social
assistance for people who refused to accept 'reasonable' jobs, writes
Michael Lindemann in Bonn. The warning is part of a series of government
measures designed to reduce unemployment, a struggle in which both the CDU
and the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD) want to demonstrate their
credentials in the campaign.
Mr Peter Hintze, CDU general secretary, said social assistance (the basic
category of benefit paid to the estimated 900,000 long-term unemployed)
would be reduced if jobs were rejected. The CDU was still debating the
details of the proposal, he said.
The employment initiative is one of a few morsels which have dropped from
the table at which the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, are
putting the final touches to their 65-page election manifesto which is to be
launched on Thursday. Mr Hintze said the manifesto's top priority would be
to create jobs. A drive to shore up family values and the fight against
crime were other important features.
Both the CDU and the SPD have made the fight against rising unemployment the
mainstay of their campaigns. Although the economy is set to grow by 2.5 per
cent this year the number out of jobs is set to remain at around 3.7m, close
to a post-war high.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government has announced several initiatives this
year including incentives for the civil service to provide more part-time
jobs and permission for private employment agencies to compete alongside
state-owned bodies in the labour market. In an effort to make further
savings in next year's budget the government is also debating whether to
introduce a two-year limit on the payment of unemployment benefit.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Dairy trade to challenge new system for milk supply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's dairy trade is to challenge the government in court over its
handling of the deregulation of the milk market, warning that retail prices
could be forced up and thousands of jobs lost.
The Dairy Trade Federation, which represents milk processors, said it was
seeking a High Court judicial review because the government had allowed the
creation of 'a monopoly supplier of milk without proper regulation or
control'.
The government gave the go-ahead to the Milk Marketing Board in June to set
up a voluntary dairy farmers' co-operative, Milk Marque, to succeed it when
the market is liberalised on November 1.
Milk Marque has already signed up farmers supplying 65 per cent of milk in
England and Wales and the dairy trade says this control over the market is
allowing it to raise prices by up to 25 per cent under its auction-based
selling system in preparation for the new regime. The federation said the
price rises would cost dairy companies collectively some Pounds 250m a year,
more than the industry's entire current annual profits.
'Consumers could see the prices of some dairy products rising by as much as
18 per cent, adding nearly 0.2 per cent to the retail price index,' said Mr
Jim McMichael-Phillips, federation president.
Simultaneously, the two biggest dairy companies, Northern Foods and Unigate,
warned their operating profits would be hit by the increase in costs,
leading to job losses and a 2p increase in the price of a pint of milk.
Mr William Waldegrave, the agriculture minister, said he would meet both
sides in the dispute on Thursday. He did not rule out referring the new
arrangements to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, as the dairy trade is
demanding.
However, he said it was hard to tell if the present difficulties were 'more
than the inevitable transitional strains, or whether they represent the
misuse of marketing power by Milk Marque'. The federation, representing an
industry with annual retail sales of Pounds 7bn and a workforce of 70,000,
plans to seek leave for judicial review within the next two weeks. If it is
granted, it hopes the hearing would take place by early October.
The move brings fresh uncertainty to the timing of deregulation, which was
scheduled for April 1. Concern last year from the European Commission and
the dairy trade over the potential monopoly position of Milk Marque forced
the Milk Marketing Board to amend its plans.
Mr Andrew Dare, chief executive of Milk Marque, yesterday accused the dairy
companies of exaggerating the increases and said the largest rise  - for
cheese manufacturers - was about 12 per cent. 'The prices we've arrived at
have not been determined by us but by the bidding behaviour of the
customers,' he added. 'They've indicated they're prepared to pay that
amount.'

FT  23 AUG 94 / Johnson &amp; Johnson in bid for grown-up market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Johnson &amp; Johnson, the US healthcare company famous for its baby products,
yesterday made a grab for the more mature end of the sensitive skin products
market with an agreed bid worth Dollars 905.9m (Pounds 584.4m) for
Neutrogena, the US soap and shampoo company.
Mr Lloyd Cotsen, Neutrogena's chairman and chief executive, has agreed to
sell his 38 per cent stake for Dollars 35.25 a share.
Johnson &amp; Johnson is offering the same price in cash for the remaining
shares. Neutrogena's shares, quoted on the Nasdaq screen-based market, rose
Dollars 6 to Dollars 34 3/4 .
Neutrogena makes and sells premium-priced soaps, shampoos and skin care
items that appeal particularly to people with sensitive skins.
Its best-known products are a clear glycerine soap and a clear shampoo, but
it has also introduced a dandruff shampoo, a suntan lotion and a product
called HeatSafe that protects hair from being damaged by curling irons and
blow dryers. Johnson &amp; Johnson is one of the world's biggest manufacturers
of healthcare products.
If the bid is successfully completed, it will add Neutrogena to its consumer
products division, whose products include Johnson's Baby Oil and Band-Aid
sticking plasters.
Johnson &amp; Johnson's other divisions make drugs and surgical products.
Johnson &amp; Johnson's baby care products are widely used by adults.
But recently the company has been trying to build up a share of the market
for speciality soaps, skin creams and shampoos aimed specifically at
teenagers and adults.
In 1991 it bought the Clean and Clear line of skin care products from
Revlon, the US cosmetics company, and last year, it bought the RoC beauty
products company from LVMH, the French luxury goods group.
One factor that all the brands have in common is that they are sold mainly
through pharmacies, drug stores and other outlets for healthcare products.
Johnson &amp; Johnson will hope to increase sales of Neutrogena soaps and
shampoos by feeding them through the same world-wide distribution channels
as its other consumer products.
Based in Los Angeles, Neutrogena sells its products in 72 countries and has
subsidiaries in Germany, France and the UK. Recently, however, growth has
been lacklustre.
In 1993, net profits rose by less than 4 per cent to Dollars 24.9m. Turnover
was up by 5 per cent at Dollars 281.7m, partly because of weak economic
conditions in Europe.
Last year the consumer products division at Johnson &amp; Johnson also put in a
relatively poor performance.
International sales were hit by adverse shifts in exchange rates, and growth
in the US market was hit by intense competition in the over-the-counter
market for vaginal yeast infection remedies. Sales rose only 0.9 per cent to
Dollars 4.8bn.
Better growth came from pharmaceutical sales, up 3.5 per cent at Dollars
4.5bn, and from the professional division, which increased turnover by 4.1
per cent to Dollars 4.8bn. Consolidated net earnings rose 10 per cent to
Dollars 1.79bn.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Economic growth set to outstrip forecasts: Second quarter
GDP up 1% on previous three months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK economy grew more quickly than expected in the first two quarters of
1994, leading economists to predict that full-year growth will be well ahead
of the Treasury's 2.75 per cent forecast.
Figures released by the Central Statistical Office yesterday show that gross
domestic product in the second quarter was 1 per cent higher than in the
previous three months, and 3.7 per cent higher than in the same period of
1993. Those figures compared with earlier estimates of 0.9 per cent and 3.3
per cent respectively.
The buoyant news on economic growth was reinforced by a Gallup poll on the
UK economy, compiled for the European Commission, which showed an increase
in consumer confidence. The balance of those expecting an improvement in
both their financial position, and in the economy, improved between July and
August.
However, some economists warned that the pace of economic growth, which is
running faster than the UK's long-term trend, might prompt the Bank of
England to push for a pre-emptive rise in interest rates, to head off
inflationary pressures.
Second-quarter growth was boosted by a strong performance from net exports,
with an improving trade performance contributing more than half the GDP
rise.
Consumer spending was also ahead, although the pace of growth, at 0.4 per
cent quarter-on-quarter, has slowed sharply from the second half of 1993,
when quarterly growth was running at 1 per cent and above. 'This is the
clearest sign we have had so far that the announcement of tax increases and
their subsequent imposition has hit demand,' said Mr Simon Briscoe at SG
Warburg Securities.
CSO figures also showed the slowest quarterly growth in income from
employment since 1967, mainly because first-quarter income was boosted by
the high level of bonus payments.
A 0.3 per cent decline in investment in the second quarter was seen as
disappointing, although economists said that year-on-year growth in fixed
domestic capital formation was 6.4 per cent.
The strength of GDP in the second quarter, combined with an upward revision
to first-quarter growth from 0.7 per cent to 0.9 per cent, show that the UK
economy is gaining momentum.
Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at Morgan Stanley, calculates that, even if
the economy were to be flat in the second half of this year, full-year
growth would still reach 2.9 per cent, ahead of the Treasury's forecast.
Growth in 1993 and 1994 has been boosted by the rapid expansion of the oil
and gas sector. But even if this volatile element is excluded, GDP grew by
0.8 per cent between the first and second quarters and was 3 per cent ahead
year-on-year.
Apart from oil and gas, the strongest industrial sector in the second
quarter was electricity and water supply. Transport and communications also
grew strongly.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Mexico's victor looks to calm election doubts: Markets rally
strongly as ruling party extends its 65-year reign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER and DAMIAN FRASER

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ernesto Zedillo, Mexico's presidential poll victor, made a gesture of
conciliation to opposition parties yesterday, but the leading left-wing
contender called for protests, claiming the elections were invalidated by
fraud.
Mr Zedillo's ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) extended its
65-year hold on power in the country by a wide margin in Sunday's elections.
As well as taking the presidency, the PRI is likely to have comfortable
majorities in both houses of Congress.
Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, candidate of the left-wing party of Democratic
Revolution (PRD), third placed in the presidential vote, told supporters
yesterday the government had 'committed an enormous fraud'. He added: 'It is
impossible at this moment to know who won this election.'
Addressing about 20,000 people in Mexico City's central square, he said: 'If
they do not count us in the ballot boxes, they will have to count us in the
town squares across the country.'
But he stopped short of claiming victory for himself as he had in the same
square after the previous presidential election in 1988.
By contrast, Mr Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, candidate of the second-placed
right-wing National Action party (PAN), said that - in spite of an
unbalanced and unfair election process - he would not dispute the poll
results.
Mexican financial markets rallied strongly on the election outcome, which
was viewed as so decisive that minor poll irregularities would have made
little difference. But the stock market slipped back from its morning peak,
closing 1.8 per cent higher. The peso strengthened.
Mr Zedillo, 42, a former central banker, was budget and education minister
in the government of Mr Carlos Salinas. He was chosen as presidential
candidate after the assassination in March of the first-choice candidate, Mr
Luis Donaldo Colosio. He will take office on December 1.
Speaking to foreign journalists after voting ended, Mr Zedillo offered a
conciliatory message to other political parties. 'Never has there been such
a convergence in the platforms of the main political parties. We are all
converging on the centre,' he said. Mexico had, he said, a 'great
opportunity to reach an important political agreement among all the
parties'.
With votes from more than 36.7 per cent of polling stations counted, Mr
Zedillo had 48 per cent of votes, Mr Fernandez de Cevallos 30 per cent and
Mr Cardenas 16 per cent. As votes from more remote rural areas were counted,
the PRI's percentage of the vote was expected to climb towards 50 per cent.
The government of President Salinas said any irregularities would not have
altered the outcome of the election, though the head of an important group
of citizens' observers, Civic Alliance, said the 'quality of the elections
is in question'.

The market is looking for profits of around SKr1.6bn when Europe's biggest
pulp and paper group reports first-half results tomorrow. Capital gains and
cost-cutting will be the main reason for the upturn from last year's SKr30m
profit, although the group will be starting to feel the benefit of rising
pulp, fine paper and sawn timber prices.

interim rise - Other companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Citic Pacific, the Hong Kong-listed arm of the Beijing foreign investment
company, reports its interim results today, kicking off the week's corporate
announcements.
Analysts are looking for a rise of more than 30 per cent at the interim
stage, giving a net income figure of HKDollars 1.04bn (Dollars 135m).
Earnings will be boosted by a full six-months' contribution from Hongkong
Telecom, in which it has a 12 per cent stake.
On Thursday it is the turn of Cheung Kong, the property developer controlled
by Li Ka-shing, to release its interims. The results will provide a pointer
for the developers which follow.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Latvia in crisis as troop deadline nears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIGA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ten days before the last Russian troops are due to leave the tiny Baltic
state of Latvia, the country is in the grip of an acute political crisis,
with no government and little chance of this changing soon, Reuter reports
from Riga.
Efforts by President Guntis Ulmanis to patch together a formula to end
government paralysis collapsed on August 18 when parliament withheld
endorsement of a conservative minority team.
Political observers said the 54-year-old president was unlikely to call
early elections. But he was also not likely to be able to get a permanent
government in place this month.
Russia's Itar-Tass news agency said Ulmanis would probably ask Latvian Way,
the largest parliament faction, to form a government after a political
crisis triggered when the Farmers' Union abandoned a previous coalition.
But the agency said other parties were likely to set conditions for the
return of the party, which backs free market economics, privatisation and
tough monetary policies.
The political crisis has hit Latvia as it seeks to appease the international
community and Russia over a controversial citizenship law and looks
anxiously to the final stage of a Russian military withdrawal.
In parallel operations signalling the end of the Russian military presence
in the Baltics, Moscow has undertaken to remove all its remaining 7,000
fighting men from Latvia and its 2,000 from Estonia by August 31.
In spite of an institutionalised mistrust of Russian intentions, few in
Latvia doubt Moscow will honour that commitment.
But a deal to let the Russian early warning station at Skundra function for
another four years and a concession to give residency rights to thousands of
ethnic Russian army pensioners still rankles with many in the Latvian
political establishment.
Ethnic Russians, most of whom arrived after the Soviet Union annexed Latvia
in 1940, make up 33 per cent of the 2.56m population.
Reaching a decision about their future acceptable to Russia and the
international community while reviving Latvian national identity has been a
challenge for post-independence governments.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin has not reneged on the troop withdrawal
commitment, but he has hinted at some form of economic retaliation.
In an attempt to resolve the government crisis, Ulmanis asked Andrejs
Krastins, a member of the National Conservative Party (LNNK), to form a new
government.
But parliament refused to approve his team, in part because of fears it
might embark on nationalist policies that would upset the Russians further
at a crucial moment.
The LNNK, which has taken a tough line on ties with Moscow and on the rights
of the Russian-speaking population, has only 15 seats in the 100-seat
parliament and was trying to form a government without Latvian Way.
Liberals said a LNNK government would seek to undo agreement on Russian
troop withdrawals, on citizens' rights and on a free trade accord with the
European Union reached by the old government of Valdis Birkavs.
But others in Latvia, where suspicions of Russian mischief run deep, say it
was necessary to have a strong leadership in place in the run-up to August
31 and the immediate aftermath.

MONDAY
Dutch cabinet sworn in
Queen Beatrix is expected to swear in Wim Kok (left), the Labour leader, as
the prime minister of a three-party coalition government with the Liberals
and left-leaning D66 party. He replaces Ruud Lubbers, whose Christian
Democrats lost the May 3 elections.
Mexico's Federal Electorate Institute is expected to finish issuing
preliminary results for Sunday's presidential and congressional elections.
The ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, in power for 65 years, enjoys
a wide lead over the opposition in opinion polls. Official results for the
House of
Deputies election come out on Wednesday. No date has been set for the
release of official results for the presidential election.
Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, arrives in Bonn for a three-day
visit. Top of the agenda in his talks with Klaus Kinkel, his German
counterpart, will be the Middle East peace negotiations, particularly the
economic reconstruction of the West Bank.
German chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing Christian Democrat party meets to
finalise its programme for the federal election on October 16. Opinion polls
suggest it will succeed in persuading the German electorate that it deserves
a fourth term in office.
Banesto, the Spanish bank which has undergone a Dollars 4bn rescue
operation, holds its annual general meeting - the first shareholders'
gathering since a controlling stake was auctioned off to Banco Santander
four months ago. The previous extraordinary meeting in March was a stormy
session which went on for nine hours.
Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, celebrates his 90th birthday.
Holidays: India.

TUESDAY
Poland seeks export boost
Waldemar Pawlak, Poland's prime minister, meets members of the Sejm,
parliament's lower house, to discuss implementing his mid-term economic
programme. Mr Pawlak, who heads a left-wing coalition, wants to capitalise
on the improvement in foreign trade.
In the first five months of this year, exports rose by 11 per cent, with the
private sector accounting for more than 48 per cent, while imports fell 2
per cent over the same period last year.
Japan's prime minister Tomiichi Murayama arrives in the Philippines at the
start of an eight-day south-east Asian tour, which takes him to Vietnam on
Thursday, Malaysia the following day, and winds up in Singapore from Sunday
to next Tuesday.
He will stress the region's importance for Japan as an investment location
but will face compensation demands from survivors in countries occupied
during the second world war.
Lac Minerals, the Canadian mining group which is the target of two unwelcome
takeover offers, will be forced to dissolve its anti-takeover protection
plan if Royal Oak Mine's CDollars 2.4bn bid, which expires today, is
accepted by more than 66 per cent of shareholders. The Ontario Securities
Commission has said that it will order Lac to remove the protection if
either of the bids - from American Barrick and Royal Oak - is accepted by
shareholders.
Germany's Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, holds a special ceremony
in Bonn for members to pay their last respects to Manfred Worner, the German
secretary general of Nato who died last week.
Russian space shots:
The first of three Russian space launches planned for this week is due to
blast off from the Plesetsk cosmodrome in northern Russia. The unmanned
operation will put a civilian communication satellite in orbit.
On Thursday, a cargo spaceship carrying fuel, water and equipment for
cosmonauts on the Mir orbital station is to be launched from the Baikonur
cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Its launch was planned originally for July but was
postponed because of lack of cash. The third launch, of a military Kosmos
satellite, takes place on Friday, also from Baikonur.
Football: The UEFA Cup second leg gets under way.
Holidays: India.

WEDNESDAY
Zimbabwe's biggest foreign investment project since independence, the
USDollars 200m Hartley platinum joint venture, will be given the final
go-ahead today when the minister of mines formally signs the special mining
lease and mining agreement on behalf of the government.
Two Australian groups, Broken Hill Proprietary and Delta Gold, are behind
the project to dig the biggest platinum mine in the western world outside
South Africa, capable of producing 150,000 troy ounces a year. Robert
Mugabe, Zimbabwe's president (above), is expected to turn the first turf at
the mine site on September 9.
Estonia is due to begin dismantling two nuclear reactors at Paldisk. The
move comes at a time when other former Soviet republics are maintaining or
expanding their nuclear energy sectors. Ukraine has chosen to continue
operating the Chernobyl reactor and Russia is building new nuclear power
facilities. Although Estonia has almost no domestic sources of energy, it
shares the environmental concerns of its Scandinavian neighbours and can
afford to buy fuel from Russia.
The Telegraph, the UK newspaper group, announces its first-half profits.
They are expected to be about Pounds 34m (Dollars 53m), up from Pounds 28m.
Its price war with rival broadsheets affected only nine days of the half, so
will have little impact.
Signs of the times: The Society for Scientific Exploration holds its
European conference in Glasgow. Among the topics to be explored are crop
circles, unidentified flying objects, homeopathy, cold fusion and
psychokinesis (to 26 August).
Football: Start of the European Cup second leg.
Holidays: Georgia (Day of National Reconciliation), Ukraine (Independence
Day).

THURSDAY
Greek corruption probe
A Greek parliamentary committee is due to report the results of an inquiry
into allegations of corruption against former Prime Minister Constantine
Mitsotakis.
It is expected to recommend that charges be pressed against the former
premier, accused of accepting a Dollars 22.5m bribe in the sale in 1992 of
Heracles General Cement to Cal-Nat, a joint venture between Greece's
National Bank and Calcestruzzi, the construction subsidiary of Italy's
Ferruzzi group.
Japan Telecom, one of the country's three long-distance telephone operators,
is to auction 17,000 shares at a minimum bid price of Y2.41m (Dollars
243,000) per share.
Germany's politicians end their summer holidays today, when the cabinet of
the governing coalition holds its first session.
The ruling Christian Democrats and the Christian Social Union, its Bavarian
sister party, unveil their campaign programme for the state and federal
elections. State elections begin in Saxony and Brandenburg on September 11,
followed by Bavaria two weeks later.
Paris will be holding ceremonies to mark the 50th anniversary of its
liberation during the second world war.
Football: The European Cupwinners' Cup second leg gets under way.
Holidays: Uruguay (Independence Day).
26
FRIDAY
Italian cabinet meets
Ministers from Italy's fractious governing coalition return to Rome for
their first cabinet meeting since the Bank of Italy raised interest rates 10
days ago to protect the currency from the effects of political uncertainty.
The meeting will be the first test of whether a 'midsummer truce' between
Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, and Umberto Bossi of the populist
Northern League will hold into the autumn.
Investors want the government to act quickly to flesh out the details of a
1995 budget which will meet the targets for reducing the Italian deficit
outlined before the summer break.
Haiti's main aid donors meet in Paris to set priorities for the time when
deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide is restored and to put pressure on

'all necessary means' to re-establish democracy in the Caribbean island.
Germany's Bundesrat, or Upper House, holds a special session to discuss
amendments to the constitution, including equal opportunities.
Holland's Festival of Early Music begins in Utrecht, with many concerts in
the town's medieval squares and along its canals (to Sep 4). This year's
themes are early music from the orient and the work of Orlando Lassus, who
died 400 years ago.
27-28
WEEKEND
Bosnian Serbs hold vote
Bosnian Serbs vote on Saturday and Sunday in a referendum on an
international peace plan which would divide the war-torn country roughly in
half. Their leaders oppose the plan in spite of intense pressure from
Belgrade and the international community.
The plan calls on Serbs to concede one-third of the 70 per cent of Bosnia
under their control to the Moslem-Croat federation. The Bosnian Serb
assembly voted to reject the plan last month.
US commerce secretary, Ron Brown, arrives in Beijing at the head of a
business development mission on Saturday. His visit will be the first by a
member of President Clinton's cabinet since the administration renewed
China's Most Favoured Nation trading status in May.
Sunday shopping: Marks and Spencer and John Lewis's supermarket chain
Waitrose, two leading UK retailers, are to open selected stores on a Sunday
for the first time in England and Wales. A law permitting Sunday trading
comes into effect on Friday. Some other retailers have been opening on
Sundays in anticipation of the law.
Motor racing: The Belgian Grand Prix is held at the Francorchamps circuit

Monday: The markets will be watching for signs that Italian consumer price
inflation has picked up significantly: they expect a 3.7 per cent rise in
the index in the 12 months to August. In the UK, large revisions to
second-quarter real GDP would be a surprise.
Tuesday: French trade figures for June are expected to to show a Ffr7.0bn
surplus, down slightly from the Ffr7.6bn recorded in May.
Wednesday: Analysts expect US durable orders and shipments for July to have
fallen back somewhat on the previous month's rise. That would provide a
little more ammunition for those arguing that the economy is slowing by
itself, and did not need last week's increase in interest rates.
Thursday: August consumer price inflation figures for Japan are not expected
to show that the downward pressure on prices is at an end. But the Bank of
Japan shows little sign of considering this a cause for lower interest
rates.
Friday: The focus will be on the US, where preliminary real GDP figures for
the second quarter are expected show the annual growth rate up slightly on
the 3.7 per cent achieved in the first three months of 1994.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Emerging Markets: Chile offers calm in an unstable continent
 -The Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a continent currently tinged with electoral and economic uncertainty,
Chile - which is unlikely to witness radical policy changes before the
presidential elections in 1999 - looks like a safe haven.
'The market . . . has defensive appeal in the current uncertain climate,'
says Mr Guillermo Tagle of Santander Investment.
Mr Paul Sparrow, a Santiago-based analyst at Barings, agrees. 'If you look
at it on the eve of the Mexican elections and six weeks before the elections
in Brazil, Chile has stability.'
Unlike Mexico, Chile has no fears of post-election political turmoil after
what is expected to be another victory for the ruling PRI party. Unlike
Brazil, it is not faced with the possibility of a shift to the left should
Mr Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, the Workers' Party presidential hopeful, be
victorious.
That stability comes at a price. According to estimates of projected
year-end earnings compiled by Kleinwort Benson, Chile is trading at a p/e of
19 against 14.4 in Mexico.
Investors that have stuck with Chile, however, have been rewarded by dollar
returns in the first eight months of 1994 of about 25 per cent, after 50 per
cent gains last year. The selected IPSA index, returned to 100 at the start
of each year, had by the close of trading on Friday reached 125.95 points.
This year, Chile has been spared some - though by no means all - of the
turmoil that rising US interest rates have inflicted on Latin American
markets. A domestic investor base with assets above Dollars 20bn and the
consequent reduction of dependence on foreign funds has helped to shelter
Chile from international storms. Capital account restrictions prevent
foreign investors from making quick dashes in and out of the Santiago
exchange.
However, Chile's market has internationalised through the exposure of ADRs
in New York. There are now 14 Chilean ADRs, representing two thirds of the
domestic market, and price moves abroad are quickly reflected at home.
Chilean ADRs are generally well-regarded, partly because of their relative,
though diminishing, scarcity, and partly because of the good reputation of
Chilean management. Largely positive second-quarter results confirmed the
reputation of Chilean companies for outpacing domestic growth.
That growth has slowed this year to a projected 4 to 4.5 per cent compared
with 6 per cent last year and 10.3 per cent in 1992. However, the 1994
performance has been better than expected, buoyed by higher prices for
Chile's principal export products, especially copper. This has helped turn a
projected annual trade deficit of nearly Dollars 1bn into a surplus of
Dollars 237m in the first six months.
Growth, which fell in the first quarter to 3.5 per cent against 7.8 in the
same period of 1993, appears to be picking up strongly with monthly economic
activity up 6.8 per cent in May, the highest in a year.
Ms Janet Krengel, senior economist at Kleinwort Benson, acknowledges that
Chile is 'the jewel in the crown of Latin America' in terms of economic
management, but she believes its growth prospects are 'tarnished' by
inflationary concerns. The government, working with a highly indexed
economy, may struggle to meet its 11 per cent target for 1994, and finance
ministry officials admit that achieving single-digit inflation will be a
laborious process.
Her fear is that the central bank will maintain high interest rates in order
to smother inflation, denting hopes of the 6 per cent growth sought in 1995
and beyond. Kleinwort Benson gives Chile an 'underweight' rating, diverting
funds to 'cheaper, more accessible markets such as Argentina'.
Although Mr Sparrow says that the recent performance on inflation has been
'disappointing', he believes the market will continue to perform well,
producing a year-end IPSA of about 140. He highlights the electricity
sector, which can count on a favourable tariff structure for at least two
years and which has seen demand grow 50 per cent faster than GDP. Expansion
projects in Peru and especially Argentina - where Chilean companies have
taken important stakes in privatised generators and distributors - should
start showing profits this year.
The outcome of the Mexican and Brazilian elections is likely to have an
impact on markets throughout the continent. Investor caution is likely to
abate given a clean Mexican poll and victory in Brazil for Mr Fernando
Henrique Cardoso, the candidate favoured by business. Whether investment
would then be diverted from Chile to other regional markets, or whether
Santiago would benefit from the general flow of funds to Latin America
remains to be seen.

Trading volume in emerging market debt worldwide totalled some Dollars
2,000bn in 1993, more than twice that recorded in the previous year,
according to a survey by the Emerging Markets Traders Association.
Brady bonds (LDC bank loans repackaged as bonds) saw even greater growth,
with trading in 1993 increasing fourfold to Dollars 1,000bn, representing
more than 50 per cent of overall market volume, up from 34 per cent in 1992.
Trading in secondary market loans reached Dollars 273bn in 1993, up from
Dollars 229bn in 1992, marking a decrease in market share from 31 per cent
in 1992 to 14 per cent last year.

<TEXT>
Regent Fund Management has warned of an impending property bubble in Hong
Kong, Reuter reports.
Mr Jim Mellon, managing director, said that Hong Kong was the main Asia
focus for foreign investors, outside Japan, but that it was significantly
overvalued, partly because 65 per cent of stock market earnings derived from
property investment.
'There is a massive shake-out coming, we are in the early stages of a 50 to
75 per cent fall over the next five years,' he said.
'But the warning signs were being muted by a lot of American latecomers to
the Hong Kong stock market.' Because of its dollar link, Hong Kong will also
see an exaggerated effect of tightening US monetary policy, in the same way
as it benefited from the easing over the past year.
He noted the Hong Kong stock market currently had the same market
capitalisation as Canada, or Italy, even though its economy and population
were smaller. He sees the Hang Seng index at 6,000 'in a year or so', from
9,480 now.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Emerging Markets: Dollar stays focus of attention -
Currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Traders are likely in the days ahead to test the downside for the dollar
after the US currency's weak showing last week.
A 50 basis point rise in US short-term rates did nothing to dissipate the
bearishness surrounding the dollar.
Economists at Swiss Bank Corporation in London argue that, 'it is quite
conceivable that in the next three months the US dollar will be testing the
low DM1.40's'
Their Swiss counterparts at UBS, however, are more optimistic. They argue
that diverging US and German interest rates, as the Fed tightens further in
1995 and the Bundesbank trims the discount rate to 4 per cent, will support
the dollar.
'We believe these interest rate moves will cause the foreign exchange market
to shift its focus. The shift will provide international investors with the
incentive to increase their holdings of Treasuries and hedge international
bond holdings.'
UBS is forecasting the dollar at DM1.625 in three months.
Traders will also be keeping a watchful eye on sterling, now that it has
slipped below the DM2.40 level.
Although the trade weighted index, at 78.5, has not fallen dramatically,
some analysts fear that the pound is vulnerable to speculative selling,
should the market conclude that the Bank of England has been insufficiently
vigilant in combatting inflationary pressures.
While many observers believe that there is no case now for higher rates in
the UK, the evidence of Sweden, Italy, the US and Australia all raising
rates - the latter two against a benign inflationary backdrop - has clearly
unsettled market nerves.
Three currencies in Europe that warrant attention are the lira, Swedish
krona and Spanish peseta.
The former two remain weak, but they have stabilised since the initial
sell-off after interest rates were raised.
The peseta, on the other hand, is vulnerable to a post-summer correction as
the market anticipates the end of the seasonal tourism boom.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Wide discounts expected in Indian GDR sector
 -International offerings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A dearth of supply and the strength of the domestic equity market have
underpinned Indian global depository receipts (GDRs) in recent weeks, but
that trend could be reversed when issuance picks up in September.
Indian issuers will need to continue pricing new issues generously if they
want to attract international capital. 'It's still very much a buyers'
market,' says a London equity salesman specialising in Indian products. 'In
September we'll probably see more GDRs issued at market discounts.'
A GDR is a receipt, issued in registered form by a depository bank,
representing ownership of shares held in custody in the equity issuer's home
market. GDRs and underlying shares are usually fungible but trade
independently.
A flood of GDRs in the first half of the year caused new paper to be priced
at increasing discounts to the domestic market. On the last issues to emerge
in late July, discounts widened to around 30 per cent.
This month, issuance has ground to a halt due to the summer lull and the
weight of undigested supply. Meanwhile, the underlying stock market rallied,
pushing the Bombay Stock Exchange Index to a new high. All this, together
with strong US buying in the secondary GDR market, has supported the sector,
allowing discounts to shrink.
'The GDR market is not very attractive at current levels,' says Mr Jeff
Chowdhry, who runs the Dollars 530m India Fund for BZW Investment
Management. 'Many issues are trading at fair value or at a premium, and the
prospect of more supply suggests the market is likely to come in for
profit-taking.'
The underlying stock market, too, may be in for a correction. 'The recent
rise occurred on fairly thin volume,' says the salesman, adding that stocks
heavily weighted in the index 'performed particularly well, pushing the
index up, but that may not reflect the market as a whole'.
Another source of weakness among secondary GDRs may be investors reshuffling
their portfolios, taking profits on recent issues and clearing the deck for
upcoming supply.
Dealers say around 20 issues have been mandated for launch before the
year-end, totalling between Dollars 1bn and Dollars 1.5bn. 'There are an
awful lot of issues in the pipeline - they probably won't all make it,' says
a London syndicate official.
On the other hand, companies needing to raise cash quickly may offer
substantial discounts to do so.
Faced with this heavy supply, investors are expected to be increasingly
selective. 'They can afford to be choosy and go for the better quality
names,' says one syndicate official. Some of the more talked-about companies
include motorcycle manufacturer Bajaj Auto with its planned Dollars 150m
issue, and the Dollars 150m deal for engineering firm Larsen &amp; Toubro.
Whether India's international telecommunications monopoly Videsh Sanchar
Nigam Ltd (VSNL) will brave the market this year remains to be seen. Its
planned Dollars 1bn privatisation issue was pulled in early May after it
failed to get the desired price.
'We're in regular talks with the government and investors are still very
interested,' said Mr Derrick Chow of the equity capital markets team at
Kleinwort Benson. 'Everyone wants to do it, but at the right price.' KB's
and Salomon Brothers' mandate to lead-manage the VSNL issue expires at the
end of the year.
There is some market talk that VSNL may return with a smaller offering.
While he declines to comment on the likely size of the issue, Mr Chow says:
'We have to be sensitive to investor sentiment - we don't want to overload
the market.'

FT  22 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Investors are shrugging off the good news -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The mood of the stock market appears likely to remain gloomy this week,
surprisingly so in view of the relatively favourable news on UK inflation
and interest rate prospects.
While welcoming the reduction in base rate fears inspired by the UK July
retail sales numbers and also the Bundesbank's decision to leave rates
unchanged, market analysts appear to be whispering, under their breath, 'but
don't you believe it.'
'Unfortunately . . .', says Richard Jeffrey at Charterhouse Tilney; itself
an interesting opening to a commentary on the latest fall in UK inflation
rate. His thesis that the best news for the market would be a rise in base
rates,
indicating that the UK Treasury,
like the US Federal Reserve, intends to be pro-active on inflation, is
echoed by several other market analysts.
At Nomura Research, Nick Knight, the notable bear of the UK market,
contrasts the latest inflation reports with signs that investors are
beginning to move against the interest rate sensitive share sectors.
His research indicates downward pressure on building material stocks which
together with stores, brewers, motors and textiles are regular
losers from rate rises or the threat of them.
He repeats the argument that if, as is probable, the UK chancellor is even
more unwilling to raise rates following the July retail sales figures, then
this is 'ultimately bearish' in terms of the rate rise which will eventually
be proved necessary.
There's no news like bad news, especially if it looks like good news,
apparently.
Nor do the market technicians provide much comfort. Derivative Securities
says its readings of the Footsie Index track continue to show that the
market is overbought and, with the Bank of England still evidently wanting
the next base rate move to be upwards, the medium-term direction (of the
Footsie) is expected to be downwards.
The market's unwillingness to make further progress is casting a shadow
across the merchant banking sector, where fortunes are closely tied to that
of the securities industry. NatWest Securities sees these banks struggling
to repeat the 1993 performance when the shares outperformed the market by 47
per cent.
NatWest sees the sector return on equity falling to 14.8 per cent in
1994-1995, compared with a record 18.2 per cent last year and an eight-year
average of 12.5 per cent.
It believes that the quality as well as quantity of earnings in the sector
is deteriorating and that only SG Warburg is 'correctly' positioning itself
to generate adequate earnings growth.

This week, the market will have to digest last Friday's interest rate rise,
announced after the close of trading; and another batch of results look
potentially disappointing, writes Louise Lucas in Hong Kong.
While the immediate impact on stock prices may not be huge - the rate rise
has been anticipated since the Fed move - there may be longer term
implications for companies' borrowing costs.
Results this week start with interims from Citic Pacific, the Hong
Kong-listed arm of the Beijing foreign investment company, and are followed
by property developers, including Li Ka-shing's Cheung Kong on Thursday.
Property watchers will also have an eye on Tuesday's land auction.

Last week's sudden appreciation of the yen against the dollar is likely to
keep investors wary, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The impact on corporate
earnings is expected to be severe if the US currency remains below the Y100
level.
Such concerns may start to materialise this week, as mid-term results leaked
to the press ahead of the September book closing will start affecting share
prices. Lower than expected half-year results may prompt profit taking in
export oriented companies, which have already been battered by the yen's
appreciation.

Sandoz, which acquired the Gerber baby foods group earlier this year,
reports maiden half-year profit figures on Thursday. The US pharmaceuticals
subsidiary of the chemicals, drugs and nutrition combine withdrew
voluntarily the lactation-suppression indication of its drug, Parlodel, last
week to end what the group called 'unwarranted criticism'.
Swiss brokers are looking for a 10 per cent rise in net profits to around
SFr940m. They say that turnover has been flat in Swiss franc terms but that
Sandoz had a SFr100m extraordinaries item at this stage last year.

Unidanmark reports interim results tomorrow. Hoare Govett says that
valuation adjustments on the bond portfolio will distort the underlying
picture, but the broker is more optimistic about underlying trends and hopes
that a satisfactory figure could encourage switching out of Den Danske Bank,
which produced disappointing interims last week.

A shiver ran through the market last Thursday when BASF, the first to report
of the 'big three' chemical groups, came out with a 41 per cent rise in
first-half pre-tax profits which was below, in some cases well below,
analysts' targets for this stage of 1994.
However, Mr Martin Glen at Lehman Brothers said BASF was subject to
restructuring and a line of its own for 'other expenses' before it came to
the pre-tax level. Given the unpredictability of this effect on the BASF
figures, he would not alter his forecasts of bumper results from Hoechst and
Bayer, due Wednesday and Thursday respectively.
Mr Glen is going for a 33 per cent rise in Hoechst pre-tax profits,
reflecting cost reduction and restructuring, and a 22 per cent gain for
Bayer which has a more defensive product mix.

<TEXT>
The nerve-wracked Swedish equities market is looking for some good news
right now and the string of interim reports due out this week from a number
of the country's leading industrial and financial groups might just supply
it, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm.
The big day is Tuesday when two of the country's leading banks,
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and Handelsbanken, the insurer, Trygg-Hansa,
and the pulp and paper group, Stora are all due to report. Wednesday will
bring results from two of the big cyclicals, engineering groups Atlas Copco
and Sandvik, while Thursday features Investor, the key Wallenberg holding
company, Trelleborg and Bilspedition.
Hopes of strong profit gains have been fuelled by better than expected
figures from Electrolux, Ericsson and SKF over the last two weeks. In the
case of the banks, the main influence is likely to be reduced loan losses,
while the cyclicals will be favoured by krona weakness, cost-cutting and
rising demand in key US and European markets. Unibank in London expects
Sandvik profits to rise to SKr1.33bn from almost SKr1bn a year ago. For
Atlas Copco it is looking for a rise from SKr661m to SKr805m.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Downwards drift looks set to continue - New
York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Federal Reserve appears to have further clouded the outlook for equities
as the summer draws to an end.
In the aftermath of last week's credit tightening, two camps have formed on
Wall Street. Their analyses differ but their uneasiness is mutual. As a
consequence, a downward drift in share prices, which began the day after the
policy announcement, is likely to continue for some time.
The first of these camps fears the Fed, in choosing to push up interest
rates, has locked into a course that will lead analysts to revise downward
their forecasts on corporate profits as the second half progresses.
The second group is convinced that the Fed has not done enough to slow the
economy, setting the stage for a further strike on rates within the next
three months. This view was buttressed last Thursday by suggestions of
continued growth and higher inflation contained in a monthly survey of
business conditions in Philadelphia.
'A negative can be seen in either side,' says Mr Thomas McManus, stock
strategist at Morgan Stanley in New York, who suggests both views are
essentially on target.
On one hand, the steepness of the yield curve on the extreme short end of
the Treasury maturity range indicates to Mr McManus that inflationary
expectations among investors remain very high. Such pessimism is likely to
make portfolio managers refrain from making fresh commitments until evidence
of a cooling economy emerges.
Expect no such indications this week. The calendar is clear of any important
economic releases until next Thursday, when the National Association of
Purchasing Management is due out with its latest reading on the
manufacturing sector. The following day will bring August employment data,
considered the most reliable barometer of the economy's strength.
Meanwhile, Mr McManus points out, historical trends suggest the shift to
tighter money last winter will start squeezing corporate profits this
quarter, which would deflate even the most bullish investor. The implication
is that a continued consolidation in share prices is almost inevitable.
'The sooner the economy starts to show clear signs of softening, the sooner
the market can rally,' the Morgan Stanley analyst says. 'But before the
signs of softening become widespread, there will first be a round of
downward revisions.'
All is not gloomy, however. An atmosphere of falling rates and restrained
profits could benefit consumer non-durable stocks, which usually exhibit
slow, steady earnings growth. That category includes two sectors - food
products and pharmaceuticals - which have been the focus of the recent
flurry of takeover speculation.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Emerging Markets: Colombo braced for share fall
</HEADLINE>

   COLOMBO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Colombo stockbrokers were braced today for a sharp fall in Sri Lankan shares
following last week's election victory by the opposition People's Alliance,
writes Stefan Wagstyl in Colombo.
Analysts said that shares, which have already fallen by over 25 per cent
from their peak early this year, could drop a further 10 per cent this week.
'I don't expect panic selling, but some investors will want to sell their
shares and few will want to buy: there will be a wait and see attitude',
says Mr Kishan Vairavanathan, an assistant general manager at CBC Crosby, a
joint venture between the Commercial Bank of Ceylon and Crosby Securities,
of Hong Kong.
Investors are concerned about the end of 17 years rule by the conservative
United National Party, which pursued pro-market economic policies. They are
worried that the People's Alliance, a centre-left coalition of nine parties,
will prove less accommodating towards business and finance.
While Mrs Chandrika Kumaratunga, the new prime minister, has pledged to
continue with economic liberalisation, there are fears that she will be
under pressure from her left wing allies to intervene more in the economy.
She has also promised to increase welfare spending, which could lead to
higher taxes or bigger government borrowing. The budget deficit last year
was up from 7.3 per cent to a substantial 8.1 per cent of GDP.
However, her supporters point out that she has pledged to try to end the
civil war in the north, in which the Sri Lankan army is fighting Tamil Tiger
separatist guerillas. A negotiated settlement would lead to lower defence
spending and open opportunities for companies to rebuild the impoverished
north.
As measured by p/e ratios, Sri Lankan shares are cheap in comparison with
others in south Asia: large stocks trade on an average multiple of about 19
times earnings for 1993 and about 14 times expected earnings for 1994.

FT  22 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: Bankers revise bund yield forecasts -
Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank obviously did not like what it saw when it came back
refreshed from its four-week summer vacation - a rise of some 40 basis
points in 10-year bund yields to more than 7.2 per cent and a market
teetering on the brink of a nervous breakdown at the prospect of a sudden
rise in German interest rates.
By leaving leading interest rates alone and extending its fixed rate of 4.85
per cent for the next two repurchase agreements (repos), the central bank
administered the equivalent of a heavy dose of valium.
It also hoped to free the market from its fixation with the very short end
of the yield curve with its public put-down of money-market funds which
accompanied its decision to halt regular issues of its 'Buli' liquidity
paper.
However, it remains to be seen whether the Bundesbank's tactics will
convince its deeply sceptical audience that there is value in longer-dated
bunds. Investors clearly believe that German interest rates are close to or
even at the trough of their current cycle and after being hopelessly
wrong-footed in other markets for much of this year, they want to be
positioned correctly for this turnround.
To be on the safe side, brokers are continuing to urge their clients to
shorten the duration of their portfolios to less than five years, from where
they will stand to benefit the most if German short-term rates turn upwards.
They are also revisiting their yield forecasts, which are once again looking
over-optimistic.
In the past week, both Deutsche Bank and Swiss Bank Corporation have revised
up their 12-month forecasts on 10-year bund yields, by 30 basis points to 7
per cent and by 50 basis points to 6.25 per cent respectively. Union Bank of
Switzerland is also believed to be in the process of nudging its forecasts
higher.
Fund managers are coming up with similar views. In its latest economic and
investment commentary, Legal &amp; General Investment Management says it will
remain underweight in global bonds because it believes that the global bond
yield will continue to rise over the medium term. It predicts that it will
reach 8 per cent in 12 months' time, compared with around 7 per cent
currently and a trough level of 5.4 per cent in January.
There have also been reports that fund managers are using any price rebound
in European government bond markets to reduce drastically their fixed-income
allocations, in some cases by as much as half, and switch the proceeds into
equities instead.
Their actions may well be justified on fundamental grounds. Although
analysts applauded the Bundesbank last week for postponing any decisions on
interest rates until the market's nerves were less frayed, at the same time
they noted that it had no compelling reason to lower interest rates.
'The Bundesbank was not under pressure to act, in view of the stronger
economic growth in Germany and the rate hikes in Sweden and Italy,' said Mr
Helmut Kaiser, senior economist at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt. 'There will
be a chance for a further rate cut if there is better news on inflation or
if pan-European currency tension increases.'
Even the release last week of pleasing M3 money supply data for July did not
justify a rate cut since they showed that bank lending growth was at its
highest level for eight months.
The Bundesbank may also have been reluctant to move on interest rates ahead
of the cost of living number for August which could disappoint. Although the
consensus forecast is for no change month-on-month, which would leave the
yearly rate at 2.9 per cent, the price rise in oil and petrol and in other
commodities, notably coffee, could push the rate back to 3 per cent.
The cautious stance towards bond markets comes at a difficult time for the
Bundesbank in view of the heavy issuance programme which lies ahead. But
three things may yet turn the situation to its advantage.
Firstly, despite its solid performance against the dollar and other leading
currencies this year, the safe-haven quality of the D-Mark could well
encourage investors to increase their holdings of D-Mark assets in the near
term. 'The D-Mark is at the top of the heap,' said Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief
economist at Citibank, adding that it would appreciate further if the ruling
CDU party remains in power after the federal elections.
Secondly, there is evidence that in the second quarter, domestic non-bank
investors increased their purchases of bunds, attracted by their current
yields of more than 7 per cent. Analysts believe this trend will to
continue.
Thirdly, a minority-held view that yields will stabilise at current levels
could triumph over the more bearish forecasts, in which case fund managers
who took refuge in cash and shorter-dated paper will have to dash back to
the long end in order to avoid underperforming their benchmark indices.
'Fund managers have a big problem now that yield curves are so steep,' says
one fund manager. 'You can't get the same return on cash as you can on
longer-dated bonds unless short-term rates rise quickly.'

After a glut of economic data last week, statistics are thin on the ground
over the next few days and the gilt market is likely to be prey to
international influences.
For Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International
(Europe), the key question is why the gilt market failed to respond more
positively last week, in the face of better-than-expected public sector
borrowing requirement and inflation figures.
One factor which may be responsible, according to Mr Richardson, is the fear
that the the yield spread against German bunds is unattractive. Ms Katy
Peters, senior economist at Daiwa Europe, thinks that Germany is likely to
be the main influence on the gilts market. 'There is quite a lot of bund
supply due over the next few weeks' she says. Ms Peters also expects
investors to watch the US, where she thinks second-quarter gross domestic
product figures will show an upward revision, to an annualised rate of 4.4
per cent.
In Britain, the two main numbers are today's second quarter gross domestic
product figures, which are expected to confirm the earlier estimate of 0.9
per cent quarter-on-quarter growth and Friday's monthly trends survey from
the Confederation of British Industry, which will be scrutinised carefully
for indications of manufacturers' pricing plans.

Stabilisation of global bond markets, appreciation of the yen, and
accommodative money market manoeuvrings by the Bank of Japan helped Japanese
bond prices last week.
Trading ahead of the September book closing - profit-taking and a switch
from listed bonds to unlisted euroyen paper and bank debentures - is
expected to weigh on bond prices this week. But expectations of economic
recovery, which have been keeping investors away, are showing signs of a
retreat.
Many analysts believe that since recovery will be slow, and deflationary
pressures will persist, the bond market sell-off has been overdone. Although
consumption has been boosted by the hot summer weather and income tax cuts,
the effects could soon wear off. The continued rise in the yen is also a
threat against corporate earnings.
Last week the July department store sales fell year-on-year in spite of
expectations of a rise. July supermarket sales due this week may reveal the
extent of continuing deflation, while August consumer price index figures
are likely to endorse expectations of low inflation over next few months.
The consumer price data is expected to fall from the previous year, for the
second consecutive month, with core inflation confirming a downward trend.

The Bundesbank disappointed the market again last week by failing to return
to variable rate repos. Instead, by ordering two more rounds of fixed-rate
tenders at an unchanged 4.85 per cent, it demonstrated that it remained on
guard against inflation.
Provisional cost-of-living figures, due this week, are expected to nudge
back over 3 per cent. While economists have already written this off as a
temporary blip in the steady down-trend, they acknowledge that the shift
towards the Bundesbank's 2 per cent ideal is decelerating.
Since the German bond market and the economy appear to be recovering without
any central bank intervention - the last discount rate cut was made more
than three months ago - there appears to be no urgency about the next step.
Meanwhile, the bank has to contemplate the disruptive potential of two
important domestic rituals looming in the next few months: federal elections
and the annual wages round.
While neither will have an immediate monetary effect, there is no accounting
for the impact on sentiment as the campaigning gets under way. There are
also disturbing signs that unions are pushing for a return to real income
growth in defiance of the Bundesbank's insistence that years of
anti-inflationary restraint are needed.

As expected, the Federal Reserve moved aggressively against inflation last
week by pushing short-term interest rates up  1/2 percentage point. This was
just what the bond market wanted, because anything less would have been seen
as insufficient to stifle the threat of inflation. Initially, bond prices
rose. However, within a couple of trading sessions the gains were wiped out
as the market became spooked by fresh inflation fears. The concerns stem
partly from data in the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's August Business
Outlook Survey and partly from another pasting for the dollar.
Consequently, the market is already fixated on the question of how long it
will be before the next interest rate rise becomes due. Traders tend to the
view that the Fed will hold back at least until November, which should help
support the market for the time being. However, the risk remains that the
least sign of inflationary pressures could batter prices.
Will that happen this week? Probably not, for there is little economic data
for investors to get their teeth into. Figures on Wednesday are expected to
show that new orders for durable goods edged up 0.4 per cent in July, while
Salomon Brothers believes revised GDP data could show a rise of 4.2 per cent
in the second quarter, 0.5 percentage points higher than the provisional
figure of 3.7 per cent.

FT  22 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: Securitisation: a viable financing
option - International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Earlier this month, GPA, the aircraft leasing company, completed a Dollars
1bn securitisation of its aircraft lease portfolio. The issue, called Alps
94-1, is the second of its kind by GPA and one of only a handful of similar
repackagings of aircraft leases.
Securitisation allows companies to remove assets from their balance sheets
by repackaging them as securities, with interest payments serviced from the
cashflows on the assets.
In the US, mortgage-backed securities are a Dollars 1,000bn market, and a
broad range of other assets, from credit card receivables to car dealers'
loans, have been securitised.
In Europe, the market has been much slower to take off, partly because there
are fewer large homogeneous pools of suitable assets. The largest market in
Europe, the UK mortgage-backed sector, has faltered due to the weakness of
the housing market.
However, the Alps deal is an example of the applications of securitisation
to niche areas such as aircraft financing, and may point the way towards the
development of a smaller, more structured market for securitisation in
Europe.
The decline in the credit quality of airlines in recent years has made it
increasingly difficult for them to secure funding through conventional
aircraft lease financing. In particular, the appetite of Japanese
institutions for leveraged lease transactions has shrunk.
'The banks and other specialised financial institutions which have
traditionally financed the airline industry are reviewing their exposure,
retrenching and in some cases withdrawing altogether,' says Mr Ian Falconer,
head of securitisation at Freshfields, the City law firm. 'A full-scale
securitisation re-characterises the perceived risks away from the particular
industry in to a homogeneous tradeable instrument with a prime credit
rating.'
The result is that securitisation - where credit ratings are based on the
quality of the assets and the structure of the transaction - suddenly
appears an economically-viable option. The senior tranche of the Alps deal
pays interest of 48 basis points over Libor, compared with a spread of up to
100 basis points which would have been needed for conventional financing,
according to bankers. 'Some of these credits could not be done at over 100
basis points in the bank-funded market,' said one banker.
However, few companies have the right sort of characteristics to benefit
from transactions such as the Alps deal. Because GPA is a lessor, rather
than a lessee, it can offer the substantial diversification needed to
complete a public offering of securities.
Most airlines cannot offer such diversification, and therefore any deals are
likely to be completed as private placements, with a more specialised group
of investors. However, some deals will be done by grouping airlines together
and pooling their leases to create the necessary diversification. Others
will be done as individual credits, based on the recovery value of the
aircraft and backed by an 18-month liquidity facility (for long-term
financings of 10-12 years).
There is likely to be a growing number of transactions, although most will
not be publicised. 'The fact is that there is an ageing fleet out there and
there will be an increasing need to purchase new aircraft,' said Mr Guy
Hands, executive director, European securitisation, at Goldman Sachs.
There is also likely to be an increase in activity in other more esoteric
areas. Airlines unable to securitise their leases are trying instead to
securitise the receivables from ticket sales, for example.
'We are working on some of the strangest beasts, securitising things like
chemical and petroleum products and shipping leases,' said a securitisation
specialist at one bank in London.
Bankers are also working on securitising commercial property loans,
particularly in areas like France and Scandinavia, where banks are weighed
down by illiquid loans.
Among the other assets being securitised in private transactions are trade
receivables in southern and east European countries and other developing
countries. The notion of pooling small groups of assets has already been
successfully used in the asset-backed commercial paper market. In recent
years, several European banks, including NatWest, Deutsche and UBS, have set
up conduit vehicles, backed by clients' receivables, which issue commercial
paper in the US market.
The market for asset-backed securities may never become the liquid,
highly-traded market it is in the US, but a more structured market may be
evolving.
Its importance, according to Mr Falconer, is that it 'enables originators to
diversify away from their traditional bank sources of finance into the
capital markets, in circumstances where the originator would be unable to
access the capital markets in its own name and on the strength of its own
balance sheet. This is particularly important for originators in sectors
which are out of favour with the banks, or in respect of which the banks are
already fully lent'.

FT  22 AUG 94 / The Markets: Lessons for UK training - Economics Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Human capital investment may be everybody's favourite economic cure-all, but
applying the prescription to the UK seems an increasingly thankless task.
Attacked from all sides, the government's training policy is partly the
victim of a longstanding ambivalence about the state's role which has yet to
be resolved.
Mr Michael Portillo, the new UK employment minister, was widely criticised
last month for proposing to halve the Pounds 4bn his department spends on
training. Yet the two central ingredients of training policy hardly received
ringing endorsements in the weeks that followed.
The Training and Enterprise Councils, established in 1990 to implement much
of the government's training programme, are ill-managed squanderers of
public funds, according to an Unemployment Unit study of London Tecs. And as
for the much-fanfared system of national vocational qualifications, an
article published in the National Institute's latest Quarterly Review* found
them an 'inappropriate' and 'inequitable' response to the UK's training
problems.
Could Mr Portillo be right in suggesting the government effectively cede
that it can do little to improve training?
At the Detroit Jobs Conference in March, his predecessor at the Department
of Employment joined his G7 colleagues in signing a statement favouring
efforts to equip the workforce with the right skills to compete for jobs.
All the participants admitted that they had difficult choices ahead in
deciding how best to reform their approach. But the difficulty facing Mr
Portillo is that the theory guiding the UK approach has always been
especially muddled.
Of the philosophies of state intervention in training represented in
Detroit, the German and American varieties seem especially relevant to the
UK's current plight.
Essentially, the US forgot about 'training' and went for an education-based
strategy to invest in human capital. No US administration has ever tried to
build a 'system' of government involvement in individuals' or companies'
employment decisions. Heavily subsidised student loans allowed a large
segment of the population to go to college.
The rest was up to that familiar US formula of individual, and corporate,
enterprise.
In Germany, government training policies were no mere educational matter,
but built on an active system of labour market involvement by the state.
Fewer young people receive general academic degrees than in the US, but many
more pupils stay on to receive narrower vocational qualifications.
Unions, central and local government and business associations have
traditionally worked together to determine the provision of training for
each part of the workforce.
As the accompanying chart confirms, the UK has not decisively opted for
either model in the past.
Governments have launched a succession of different strategies, with
decidedly mixed results. But the country has never decided whether training
is primarily a matter of education or employment policy.
Few would suggest that the UK now rush to take a 'German' or 'American'
stand on the question, even if such a late conversion were possible. Indeed,
both countries are now seeking to amend their answers in important ways.
In Germany, many feel that a heavy emphasis on vocational qualifications
produces an inflexible workforce. In the US, the fear is that a 30 per cent
graduation rate leaves too many out of the equation altogether.
Does this mean that the UK is now perfectly placed for a mixed approach, one
which avoids all the pitfalls? The government appears to be aiming at just
such a blend: boosting the number of graduates while introducing 'modern
apprenticeships' and NVQs.
Changing established habits, however ill-defined, will be a long process: Mr
Portillo should certainly draw this conclusion from experiences elsewhere if
he does not not know it already. But the American and German experiences
could hold deeper warnings for the strategy as a whole.
The cautionary tale from the US is social. Graduates earn hefty wage
premiums in later life, but an economic and social chasm has developed
between graduates and unskilled 'high school drop-outs', whose real wages
have fallen steadily over the past 20 years.
Recent German experience hints at a rather different lesson: letting nearly
everyone get some kind of qualification does few favours to those who are
taught to work in a highly specific, possibly declining, line of work.
Britain's mixed approach may attempt to avoid these pitfalls but the authors
of the National Institute study find little evidence to suggest that the
'third way' promises to be a fruitful one.
Explicit and implicit education expenditures remain skewed towards
university, and pre-university, students. At the same time, in the building
trade, at least, they find that the 16-18 year-olds not queuing for college
places are acquiring NVQs which are too narrow to permit 'the flexibility or
career development in later years which the economy and technology
increasingly demand'.
Eclecticism, in other words, seems to be delivering the flaws of both
systems and the benefits of neither. *Shifting Foundations: the Impact of
NVQs on Youth Training for the Building Trades. Steedman H and Hawkins J,
NIESR, Aug 1994.

FT  22 AUG 94 / The Markets: Japan in the doldrums - Global Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The torpor induced by Japan's hot summer seems to have left the stock market
becalmed. Since the end of June, the Nikkei has traded in an exceptionally
narrow range between 20,000 and 21,000.
Trading volumes, though still higher than they were in the dog days of
1992-93, have dipped to 300m shares a day on average, as investors and
traders alike have succumbed to the lethargy.
But the summer stasis owes more to harder economic facts than it does to the
heat. The key lies in the financial lassitude of domestic investors.
Share prices surged in the first half of the year, as foreign investors
sensed a bargain. Japan was hovering on the brink of recovery, the yen was
surging, and the rest of the world's stock markets were plunging, a treble
chance that made Tokyo stocks understandably popular with foreigners.
But in the course of the summer, that momentum has been lost as
profit-taking has set in. After six straight months of heavy buying,
foreigners became net sellers at the start of July. What is left is the
uncomfortable truth, hidden by the foreign-led surge, that Japan's domestic
investors have been equity-shy.
In the first six months of 1994, while foreigners shopped for shares,
domestic corporations recorded net sales of Y3.2 trillion of equities on the
first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Individuals, who have been net
sellers of stocks for all but one of the past 12 months, sold a net Y710bn
worth of shares. Over the summer, the figures have changed little.
If the yen has indeed peaked, and if 1994's global bond and equity rout has
been brought to an end, the prospects for a resumption of Tokyo's bull
market will depend heavily now on those investors rediscovering the charms
of the Japanese blue chips.
There is little evidence that this will happen soon. The main categories of
investor remain very shy of a market which has burned them badly in the past
few years. One broker says his domestic clients are so despondent they have
no serious plans to buy equities 'for the rest of the century'.
This is probably overdoing it. The past two months have seen a little
nibbling at the market by some of the main investors, notably banks and
individuals. But the prospects for large-scale buying by the institutions is
minimal. Investment trust average equity weightings have been rising, but at
over 65 per cent analysts think they now stand close to, or even above,
their natural ceilings.
Life insurers, hit by a steep decline in their return on assets that has
rendered most of them technically unable to meet their liabilities, are
still aggressively reducing their risk exposure. Nippon Life, the country's
largest institutional shareholder, recently declared its intention to unload
another Y315bn in equities.
Industrial corporations, many of them engaged in restructuring programmes,
are in no mood to return to the zaitech so fashionable in the 1980s. They
have been net sellers of shares for the past 16 consecutive months.
The really troubling element has been that these risk-averse investors have
chosen to keep their funds in cash. Despite historically low short-term
interest rates of less than 3 per cent, institutional cash weightings rose
from 25 per cent to 32 per cent early this year, falling back only slightly
in the spring. If the next move in official interest rates is upwards, the
prospect of a significant shift back to equities will remain slim.
The caution among the Japanese is understandable. The market's recovery in
the first half of the year heavily discounted a big corporate earnings
recovery in the current fiscal year, after four consecutive annual falls. In
the spring, forecasters were expecting a pre-tax profits rebound of about 20
per cent this year. A stubbornly high yen has already forced most of them to
revise that to less than 15 per cent. The preternaturally more cautious
Japanese forecasters are now expecting profit increases in single figures in
percentage terms.
These poor profits presentiments are pushing valuations sharply higher.
Prospective p/es, though not wholly reliable measures of value in Japan, are
back to historic highs, as are earnings/yield ratios.
Japan Telecom
Lack of institutional demand is unlikely to be a problem when Japan Telecom,
one of the country's three long-distance operators, comes to market next
month.
Only two other large telecommunications companies, NTT and DDI, are
currently listed, and both have outperformed the market impressively this
year. JT's entry into this limited market plus global enthusiasm for
anything that passes for 'multimedia' is likely to ensure a good reception.
Moreover, just 10 per cent, or 34,000 shares in the company, are being
offered to investors this week - half of them in Thursday's auction that
will set the price, the other half in a direct offering immediately
afterwards.
The issue has attracted additional interest because it is the first initial
public offering ever to involve a separate international tranche. 5,000 of
the shares will be offered to international investors. Bids must be received
by close of business in London on Friday.
Investors are limited to five shares each, a hangover from the Recruit
shares-for-favours political scandal of the late-1980s. At a minimum bid
price of Y2.41m, the 'five share rule' is a mite restrictive, so activity in
the secondary market is likely to be brisk.
But longer-term prospects are more doubtful. Though the company has the
particular advantage of its own information super-railway - it was
originally the telecommunications arm of Japan Railways, and JR still owns
50 per cent of the company - competition in the long-distance field is
strong and growing. In addition to JT, DDI, and Teleway Japan are
fast-growing operators.
Earnings have been under pressure in the past year as competition has forced
price cuts. The company already lags behind DDI in the cellular phone
business, and as yet no-one quite seems to know what it is going to send
along its much-vaunted fibre-optic cables.
Stronger competition in these core businesses is likely to squeeze further
JT's profit margins. Not that that will worry those lucky enough to win a
ticket in the JT lottery this week.

FT  22 AUG 94 / The Markets: Go-ahead for platinum mine - Commodities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Zimbabwe's biggest foreign investment project since independence, the
USDollars 200m Hartley platinum joint venture, will be given the final
go-ahead on Wednesday when the minister of mines formally signs the special
mining lease and mining agreement on behalf of the government.
Two Australian groups, Broken Hill Proprietary and Delta Gold, are behind
the project to dig the biggest platinum mine in the western world outside
South Africa, capable of producing 150,000 troy ounces a year. Mr Robert
Mugabe, Zimbabwe's president, is expected to turn the first turf at the mine
site on September 9.
Elsewhere, the International Natural Rubber Organisation is holding a
meeting today at its Kuala Lumpur headquarters to review the buffer stock
operations with which it tries to stabilise rubber prices within a
pre-determined range. The review is mandatory under the rules of the
International Natural Rubber Agreement following the sale of 100,000 tonnes
of stockpiled rubber in an attempt to damp down rising prices.
Tomorrow, also in Kuala Lumpur, the Association of Natural Rubber Producing
Countries will meet to decide on its response to any action agreed at
today's session. ANRPC members have been unhappy over the refusal of Inro's
consuming country members to consider a rise in the Inra target range in the
light of the market's recent strength and have threatened to set up their
own price support system.
Today also sees the publication of aluminium production figures for July
covering members of the International Primary Aluminium Institute. This will
give a further indication of progress with the output-cutting agreement
reached by leading producing countries in January.
On Thursday the International Wheat Council is to publish its monthly Market
Report, giving its latest assessment of world-wide production and
consumption prospects for wheat and coarse grains.

FT  22 AUG 94 / International Company News: IBM gears up for PC price war -
The personal computer division is being reshaped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The general outlook at International Business Machines is getting brighter,
with modest profits forecast for the year. However, clouds are gathering
over the company's Dollars 12bn personal computer business.
Only marginally profitable, and with virtually flat revenues in a rapidly
growing market, the IBM Personal Computer Company has seen its market share
fall sharply over the past year. In the US, IBM has lost its market
leadership, falling to fourth place behind Compaq Computer, Apple Computer
and Packard Bell in terms of unit sales.
Adding to IBM's PC woes, Compaq has slashed prices on many of its products
by up to 22 per cent, in a move that is expected to prompt a price war
throughout the PC industry.
IBM PC is also faced with having to bring to market this year a
long-promised range of PCs based on 'PowerPC' chips jointly developed with
Motorola and Apple Computer. What should have been an opportunity for IBM to
pull ahead of the pack in the personal computer market now appears far less
promising, at least in the short term.
To knock IBM PC into shape, Mr Lou Gerstner, IBM chairman and chief
executive, has brought in Mr Rick Thoman, a long-time colleague at American
Express and RJR Nabisco. Mr Thoman, who joined IBM in January, is known as a
tough manager and an experienced international marketer.
In a sweeping reorganisation of the IBM PC business, Mr Thoman has disbanded
the self-contained 'brand teams' set up to develop and market IBM's various
PC product lines. He has also announced plans to consolidate IBM PC's US
operations, bringing most together at four sites, down from over a dozen,
with the loss of between 1,500 and 2,000 jobs. 'There is a trilogy of things
you have to worry about: cost, quality and speed,' says Mr Thoman. IBM PC is
the best in the industry in terms of quality, he claims, 'but we have higher
costs and are slower than some of our best competitors. So our objective is
to get our costs down to competitive levels and become much faster in terms
of reacting to the marketplace and getting new models out on time.'
Streamlining the organisation will cut costs, but more importantly it will
speed up response times, Mr Thoman says. Although the IBM PC company was
regarded just a year ago as a model 'independent business unit', it had in
fact become bogged down in bureaucracy, he says.
'To fill a typical corporate order, 13 managers had to sign off on various
decisions,' he complains. 'Obviously, that made us slower than our
competitors.'
Mr Thoman has also laid plans to simplify IBM's 'almost unmanageable' array
of products - about 70 models with over 400 different configurations - and
to standardise components throughout the product range. This will help to
save costs and reduce inventories, he explains. A new worldwide information
system is also being installed to help manage supply and demand for products
by simplifying inventory transfers.
Managers from IBM PC's UK factory have been put in charge of efforts to
shift production to a more efficient 'build-to-order' schedule, already
implemented at the plant in Greenock, Scotland.
As a newcomer to the computer industry, Mr Thoman observes that the IBM PC
business is 'like a healthy young child who does some things very well and
some things abysmally badly'. He says: 'There is too much focus on
technology and very little on what customers want and need.'
For IBM, the Power PC microprocessor is a pertinent example of technology
versus customer needs. Heavily promoted by IBM, Motorola and Apple over the
past three years as a higher-performance alternative to the established PC
technology standard, based on Intel-designed microprocessors, PowerPC lacks
the software base to make it useful to most PC buyers. Yet IBM is committed
to delivering PowerPC personal computers later this year.
Mr Thoman does not hide his lack of enthusiasm for the new technology.
'People in the industry and even occasionally within IBM seem to want me to
say something different, but I believe that the customer comes first. From
an IBM PC point of view, we don't care which technology the customer
chooses. If they want PowerPC, we have it. If they want a traditional PC
(based on an Intel microprocessor) we have those too. Increasingly, it
doesn't bother me.'
PowerPC remains, however, a central element of the technology strategy for
the whole of IBM. So, while it may not be ready for the IBM PC market, Mr
Thoman has little choice but to put machines on the market that already seem
doomed to sell poorly.
An even more pressing problem for IBM PC is intense price competition.
Compaq's latest price cuts are aimed squarely at IBM's traditional
stronghold in the corporate sector of the PC market. Now IBM faces the
difficult choice between matching Compaq's prices or risking a further
decline in market share.
How IBM responds to this new challenge will be a test for Mr Thoman and his
new management team at IBM PC. The PC industry, he is quickly finding out,
is brutally competitive.
It is also, however, 'an industry in which companies have a history of
making comebacks', he observes. 'To be a true industry leader, you have to
demonstrate superiority not over a half year, or even a whole year, but over
a period of several years.'

<TEXT>
Big price rises and higher volumes led to a tripling of first-half profits
at SSAB, putting the Swedish steel group on course for record full-year
figures.
Profits after financial items amounted to SKr1.05bn (Dollars 133.2m), up
SKr715m from a year ago, after a 20 per cent rise in sales to SKr7.6bn.
Full-year profits are expected to be more than double 1993's SKr776m. This
would exceed the SKr1.58bn profit achieved in the 1989 boom year.
SSAB, already benefiting from rigorous cost-cutting and the weak Swedish
currency, is seeing a strong pick-up in the market.
First-half prices were 15 per cent higher than a year ago, and they
accounted for 13 percentage points of the group's increase in sales.
Volumes, accounting for the balance of the sales increase, have been driven
up by rising demand in Sweden and the rest of Europe.
Mr Leif Gustafsson, chief executive, said: 'The recessionary phase seems to
have ended and steel demand is once again increasing on most western
European markets.'
Margins improved because raw material prices were only 6 per cent higher
than a year ago, and the increase in processing costs was held to 3 per
cent.
The best performance came from the group's Tunnplat steel plate division,
where profits after financial items climbed to SKr557m from SKr58m on a 29
per cent increase in sales to SKr4.05bn.
In the second half, the group will benefit from mid-year price increases and
a further weakening of the krona, although holiday production and
maintenance stops will mitigate their impact.

FT  22 AUG 94 / International Company News: Share issue helps boost Gambro
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gambro, the newest Swedish recruit to the Wallenberg domain, has reported
first-half pre-tax profits of SKr582m (Dollars 73.8m), up 18 per cent from
SKr495m a year ago.
The rate of increase outpaced growth in sales and operating profit, largely
because a share issue last year reduced interest expenses.
The Swedish medical equipment specialist said it expected its earnings to
continue to develop favourably. It became part of Incentive, one of the key
companies in the Wallenberg sphere, in June after being targetted because of
its strong growth prospects.
Higher costs, increased depreciation and R &amp; D expenses restricted growth in
operating income to 9 per cent, and lowered the operating margin to 14.8 per
cent from 15.3 per cent.
However, the group made up for this with a reduced interest bill of SKr156m,
compared with SKr195m a year ago, following its SKr400m rights issue last
year.
All but of one of the group's five business areas expanded sales, taking
group sales up 13 per cent to SKr4.89bn. The increase was 10 per cent after
adjusting for exchange rates.
The group's main unit, renal care, increased sales to SKr3.2bn from
SKr2.90bn. However, sales within the intensive care and anaesthesia division
fell because of health sector investment restraints.

<TEXT>
Wal-Mart Stores, the US discount store group and the world's biggest
retailer, its planning to expand into Asia by opening stores in Hong Kong
and China.
The company says it will carry out the expansion through a joint venture
agreement with Ek Chor Distribution System, a Hong Kong company owned by
Charoen Pokphand, the multinational conglomerate and Thailand's biggest
business group.
The joint venture expects to start by opening three or four Value Clubs in
Hong Kong this autumn. At between 10,000 sq ft and 20,000 sq ft per store,
the Value Clubs will be a smaller version of Wal-Mart's membership warehouse
clubs, which operate as Sam's Clubs in the US.
Later, the joint venture plans to enter mainland China with discount stores
and membership warehouse clubs similar to Wal-Mart's US discount stores and
Sam's Clubs.
The move into Asia marks a significant departure for Wal-Mart, as it is the
company's first move outside the Americas, where it has 2,091 Wal-Mart
discount stores, 87 Supercenters (discount stores and supermarkets
combined), and 434 Sam's Clubs.
The company began its expansion outside the US in 1991, when it signed a
joint venture agreement with Cifra, Mexico's largest retailer. In March this
year it acquired 122 Woolco discount stores in Canada from Woolworth, the US
retailer, and started converting them to the Wal-Mart format.
Also in March, Wal-Mart established its first Asian links when it signed a
deal with Ito-Yokado, the Japanese supermarket chain, to start supplying its
own-brand products to the Japanese retailer.
With the US retail market suffering from saturation, Wal-Mart has gone the
way of other large US retailing groups, which are tending to look outside
their domestic market for growth.

FT  22 AUG 94 / International Company News: Slimmer Aga lifts profit 11% on
improved sales

Aga, the newly-streamlined Swedish industrial gas group, has reported
profits after financial items up by 11 per cent in the first half, to
SKr785m (Dollars 99.5m) from SKr709m in the same period last year.
The company, which ranks fifth among the world's commercial gas suppliers,
recently spun off its subsidiary Frigoscandia - the world's biggest cold
storage chain - as a wholly-independent listed company to concentrate on
industrial gas operations.
Its half-year results, fully adjusted to exclude Frigoscandia, showed sales
ahead 12 per cent at SKr6.08bn, compared with SKr5.45bn in 1993. It cited an
upturn in the Nordic and US economies as the main reason. However, demand in
continental Europe was weak while the economy of Venezuela, another
important Aga market, deteriorated.
Aga said it anticipated a similar performance in the second half, and
forecast an improvement in pre-tax profits after financial items over the
full year. Last year the figure was SKr1.36bn, excluding Frigoscandia.
Frigoscandia, given away to Aga shareholders in July, earlier reported a
fall in first-half profits after financial items to SKr10m from SKr57m last
time. Sales were down to SKr2bn from SKr2.09bn. However, the company
forecast a stronger second half, taking expected full-year profits to around
SKr150m, against SKr204m last year.
Aga is investing heavily in eastern Europe, and said it now owned 85 per
cent of Balashiha Kislorodny Zavod (BKZ), one of Russia's two biggest
industrial gas groups, which it first bought into in June. BKZ, with 360
employees and annual sales of SKr45m, is the largest gas supplier in the
Moscow area. Aga already has gas companies in Kaliningrad and St Petersburg.
Mr Marcus Storch, chief executive, said although the purchase price of BKZ
was small, the investment commitment by Aga was high.

FT  22 AUG 94 / International Company News: BIS finds mixed securities trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors were heavy sellers of securities in the first quarter, while banks
became net sellers in the second quarter, according to the latest report on
international banking and financial market developments by the Bank for
International Settlements.
In the first quarter, there was 'a major reduction in holdings of foreign
securities by non-bank entities located in Japan', according to the report.
'As a result of an increased preference for liquidity among non-bank
investors, banks in the US, Germany, Switzerland and France recorded a
strong rise in external liabilities.'
While institutional investors may have completed much of their portfolio
adjustment by the end of the first quarter, following the turnround in the
US interest rate cycle in early February, some banks were net sellers of
securities in the second quarter, having been net buyers in the first.
However, Japanese residents became net buyers in April.
Unsettled market conditions also affected financing activity, with primary
issues of international bonds down 33 per cent from the first quarter at
Dollars 90bn, and net new issuance down 61 per cent. This suggests that
reflows of capital and interset payments were the main support of activity.
'Increased investor reluctance to commit funds to bond issues forced some
borrowers to delay planned flotations, to scale down the size of offerings,
to shorten the maturity profile of their debt or to offer investors more
generous terms,' the report said.

Savoy Hotel yesterday firmly denied a newspaper report that a secret
agreement had been reached with Forte, the rival hotel group, which has
waged a 13-year struggle to acquire the Savoy group, whose hotels include
the Savoy, Claridge's and the Connaught.
The Savoy group said, 'there is no agreement between Savoy and Forte, no
secret deals have been agreed, nothing has been agreed secretly or openly
and if any agreement had been reached over any proposals they would be
announced in the proper manner.'
The company added that no proposals have been put to the board which is not
due to meet again until next month.
Late last month the Savoy board revealed to the Stock Exchange that it had
become aware of discussions between Forte and some of the trusts which have
a significant interest in the share capital of the Savoy.
The trusts involved in the discussions are widely thought to be those of the
Wontner family, represented by Mr John Sinclair, a Savoy director.
If Forte, chaired by Mr Rocco Forte, son of the group's founder, can
persuade Mr Sinclair to become its ally, it would gain effective control of
Savoy.
Forte acquired 68 per cent of Savoy's share capital, but only 42 per cent of
its votes, following an acrimonious takeover battle in the 1980s. Support
from Mr Sinclair would give Forte a clear majority of the votes.
Under a 1989 peace agreement Forte agreed not increase its stake in Savoy
for five years and agreed to give 12 months notice if it wanted to do so.
This requirement remains even after the five-year period ends in November.

FT  22 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Servisair plans October float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Servisair, the former British &amp; Commonwealth subsidiary and Europe's largest
aircraft and passenger handling company, is to come to the stock market in
October valued at more than Pounds 50m.
Servisair currently handles about 23.5m passengers a year or one aircraft
every 90 seconds, and it operates out of all the UK's largest airports, with
the exception of Heathrow.
It should benefit from increasing air traffic and a trend for airlines to
contract out their more labour-intensive non-core activities, such as
ticketing and baggage handling.
Servisair's profits are slanted towards the second half, and next weekend,
the bank holiday, will be the busiest of the year, when it will process more
than 650,000 passengers.
The passenger trend has been upwards, and despite the impact of the
recession and the Gulf war on the travel market during the 1990s, Servisair
has recorded 10 years of uninterrupted profits growth.
In 1993 its operating profits were up 35 per cent to Pounds 3.6m and
earnings have increased tenfold in 10 years.
The group derives about 70 per cent of its profits from passenger handling,
with 25 per cent coming from cargo, and the remainder from operating lounges
and other businesses.
It handles all the passenger services for three of the UK's four largest
charter airlines: Brittania, Air Tours and Air 2000, and charter flights
accounted for 53 per cent of passenger revenue in 1993. It also represents
international airlines from Air France (all its flights outside Heathrow) to
Pakistan International.
The company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Securum, the Swedish investment
company formed after the 1992 collapse of Nordbanken.
Servisair started as an offshoot of B&amp;C's shipping operations during the
1950s and 1960s and became part of Bricom, B&amp;C's industrial holding company.
Bricom was privatised in 1988 by its management, but was bought out by
Swedish investors in 1990, and ended up with Nordbanken as collateral for a
bad loan.
It will be the first Securum flotation outside Sweden but is to be followed
by others, including its extensive UK property interests and another former
B&amp;C industrial subsidiary, ANC, which operates a parcel delivery service.
It is planned that Securum will retain a stake of about 40 per cent in
Servisair, which will also raise some capital from the offer of new shares
through a placement and intermediaries offer.
In the short term Servisair should achieve profits growth from the impact of
the recent purchase of Ogden Aviation Services, which gives the group an
entry into Birmingham International Airport.
Most analysts forecast passenger growth of between 5 and 7 per cent a year
up to the year 2000.
Mr Tony McCann, chairman, argued that airlines were going through a 'period
of self-examination', which should see independent companies start to pick
up more of the airlines' management intensive non-core activities.
Given the breadth of its business, it can utilise its staff efficiently and
employs up to 3,300 people during peak periods of the year.
Mr McCann also expects some of the airport monopolies to be broken up. It
recently won the baggage handling franchise for East Midlands Airport, and
is optimistic that other opportunities will emerge.
In the longer term, it plans a push into continental Europe, having already
developed a presence in the Netherlands.
The listing is sponsored by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, with Cazenove as
stockbroker.

Compell Group, a computer systems and services group, plans to come to
market next month via a share placing with institutional investors which is
expected to value the group at around Pounds 25m, writes Paul Taylor.
The Welwyn Garden City-based group expects to raise about Pounds 4.5m of new
money through the flotation which will involve the placing of shares worth
about Pounds 11m. The issue is sponsored and underwritten by Societe
Generale Strauss Turnbull Securities.
Compell, the subject of a 1987 management buy-out, has grown into one of the
UK's leading independent systems integrators within its sector.
The directors will announce pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.06m (Pounds 604,000)
on turnover of Pounds 54.5m (Pounds 43.8m) for the year to June 30 when the
flotation prospectus is published.

FT  22 AUG 94 / International Company News: Maybank shows 46% advance to
MDollars 1.16bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Malayan Bank, Malaysia's biggest financial institution, has reported a
pre-tax profit for the year ending June 30 1994 of MDollars 1.16bn (Dollars
451m), a 46 per cent increase on the previous year's figure.
The improvement puts Maybank firmly in the top echelon of Malaysia's
corporate money earners. Only Telekom Malaysia, the telecommunications
utility, and Tenaga Nasional, the electricity utility, both partially
privatised in recent years, have achieved MDollars 1bn plus profit levels.
Mr Amirsham Aziz, Maybank's managing director, said the advance was the
result of an expanded loans base, higher profits from foreign exchange
dealings, strong growth in fee-based activity and further improvement in the
quality of the bank's assets. The bank also benefited from the upsurge in
the equity market.
More than 80 per cent of Maybank's profits came from operations within
Malaysia. Mr Amirsham said loan growth had been particularly strong - up
nearly 13 per cent compared with a 6 per cent growth in the rest of the
banking industry.
Mr Amirsham said that future prospects were good, given the continued strong
growth of the Malaysian economy.
He said that efforts were being made to diversify Maybank's earnings base in
the face of stronger competition from other institutions. Maybank now plans
to make its presence felt elsewhere in the region.
Financial analysts describe Maybank as one of Malaysia's most conservatively
managed institutions. They say that while the bank has performed well in the
protected domestic market, it might find profits more difficult to achieve
as it exposes itself to competition overseas.

<TEXT>
Cementos Mexicanos, the Mexican cement company, has extended its presence in
Latin America by buying Cementos Bayano, the Panamanian plant, for Dollars
57.7m (Pounds 37.2m).
The plant was sold by the Panamanian government as part of its privatisation
programme. Its sales reached 300,000 tonnes of cement last year, about half
Panama's domestic consumption, while its production capacity is estimated at
360,000 tonnes of cement and 700,000 tonnes of clinker.
The purchase widens the global reach of the Mexican cement company, which is
the fourth largest in the world with capacity of 40m tonnnes. Earlier this
year Cemex bought a controlling stake in Vencemos, Venezeula's largest
cement company, adding to existing operations in the south of the US, in
Cuba and in Spain.
'This acquisition represents an important step in our strategy of expansion
in the Latin American market and for the first time gives us production in
Central America,' said Mr Lorenzo Zambrano, the head of Cemex.
Cemex will acquire 95 per cent of the company. The remaining 5 per cent will
go to Bayano employees.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Hearing an explosion on the grapevine: The race is on to win
a prize from the boom in US mobile communications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The contestants are only now beginning to hit full stride in the race to
become a dominant player in the booming US mobile communications market.
A variety of billion-dollar deals have been negotiated between cellular
phone operators and telecoms companies in an intense period of consolidation
for the US wireless communications business, which embraces mobile phones,
two-way pagers and messagers, portable fax machines and hand-held computers.
The holy grail of the cellular business is to achieve national coverage
because the potential for growth in what is still a relatively young market
is huge. Of the 16m or so subscribers, most are business users who can
afford the present high costs. The challenge for cellular companies is to
build a nationwide network providing ordinary consumers with a high-quality,
low-cost product.
Mr Ronald Altman, an analyst at New York securities house Furman Selz,
estimates that a decade from now there could be 100m cellular subscribers in
the US. Hence the frantic search for partners as companies try to build
their competitive muscle.
Since early July, two regional 'Baby Bell' phone companies, Bell Atlantic
and Nynex, have decided to unite their cellular operations, another Baby
Bell - US West - has agreed to merge its cellular interests with AirTouch
Communications, and Nextel Communications, a mobile radio dispatch company,
has spent Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.54bn) acquiring a rival, Dial Page, and
the mobile radio assets of Motorola.
Several companies have also set out to broaden existing alliances. US West
has held talks with Time Warner, the entertainment group, and the
Chicago-based Baby Bell, Ameritech, has been talking to AirTouch, US West,
Bell Atlantic and Nynex, among others.
The rush to form or join cellular consortia comes less than a year after
AT&amp;T's move to buy McCaw Cellular Communications for Dollars 12.6bn. The
union of the long-distance telephone giant with the country's leading
cellular carrier, approved by federal regulators last month, endorses the
potential of the cellular communications industry in the US and helped to
drive regional phone companies and cellular carriers into each others' arms
as they realise that they stand a better chance of competing with AT&amp;T-McCaw
if they join forces with one another.
The ultimate objective behind the mergers and alliances is to create
nationwide cellular networks that will allow subscribers relatively cheap
and easy access to a wide range of wireless communications services wherever
they are in the country.
Since the mid-1980s, when the government broke up AT&amp;T and divided the
national cellular market into regions, each with a Baby Bell and an
independent carrier, the cellular business has been fragmented. Although
special 'roaming' arrangements between carriers allow subscribers to use
their phones outside their home region, the costs are passed on in roaming
fees. Consequently, the company or consortium which creates a national
network will have the chance to provide customers with a much better
service.
The prize will be a bigger slice of a rapidly growing market. By the end of
last year, 16m people were subscribers to cellular phone services in the US,
with 14,000 new customers signing up every day. EMCI, the Washington-based
communications consultancy, estimates the total will reach 20m by the end of
this year. They and other analysts believe that the 25 per cent growth rate
could accelerate into 1995 and 1996.
Industry consolidation is also being driven by the emergence of a new system
of radio telephony called personal communications services, such as advanced
paging, messaging, phone, fax and data services. PCS - which relies on
digital, as opposed to lower-capacity analogue technology - will offer a
better service than is now available on cellular phones, which have been
plagued by customer dissatisfaction with quality and cost.
The PCS era will begin in earnest this October when the US government
auctions licences to broadband PCS networks. If the recent auction of the
narrowband PCS licences - for less sophisticated services such as paging and
messaging - is anything to go by, demand for the broadband licences will be
brisk. The 10 narrowband licences were sold for Dollars 617m. Analysts
estimate that the much larger auction of broadband PCS licences could enrich
federal coffers by Dollars 10bn, or more. Companies have been rushing to
forge alliances ahead of these auctions, so that they know where they need
broadband licences to complement their existing coverage.
Mr Ronald Altman, an analyst at New York securities house Furman Selz,
explains: 'The more existing properties you can put together, the less
additional PCS franchises you will have to bid for to be able to provide
national coverage. Therefore, you are going to see a mad scramble to get as
big a footprint as possible by the existing cellular operators, so that they
can focus on bidding for those PCS franchises that will round out national
coverage.' This helps explain why, as Mr Altman says: 'The level of
discussion activity right now is off the charts.'

FT  22 AUG 94 / Company News (This Week): Stones and monks enliven first
quarter - Thorn EMI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Analysts will be examining with interest the results from Thorn EMI
tomorrow. It will be the first time the music and rental group has reported
on the first quarter.
Most agree it has been a relatively quiet three months to June in the music
industry, with only two big releases on the Virgin and EMI labels  - the
Rolling Stones and the Benedictine Monks. Recent US statistics suggest
overall sales growth in the music market was more than 10 per cent in the
first half of the year, and positive noises from Polygram at its recent
results suggest similar growth in Europe.
Although most analysts are loath to make predictions on Thorn without
comparable figures from last year, music sales growth of around 7 per cent
is being pencilled in.
Music accounts for nearly two-thirds of Thorn's profits. Operating profits
of between Pounds 45m and Pounds 55m are tentatively forecast for the
division, out of total overall profits of between Pounds 67m and Pounds 77m.
A goodwill write-down on the sale of some non-core assets should bring
pre-tax profits in at around Pounds 50m-Pounds 60m.
Thorn's rental business, which includes Rumbelows in the UK and
Rent-A-Center in the US, should chip in with operating profits of around
Pounds 25m. The company is expected to give more details of new store
formats it has been trying out. Analysts also hope to be reassured about the
performance of the US operations in the face of the wide availability of
cheap credit, which could hurt trade at Rent-A-Centre.
Thorn shares, which have underperformed the market by around 8 per cent in
the past three months, have recently rallied, reviving speculation over the
group demerging. Observers, however, do not expect any further comment from
the management on the subject tomorrow.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Company News (This Week): Upbeat forecasts for chemicals
giants - Hoechst/Bayer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hoechst and Bayer, the German chemicals giants, report their half-year
results this week, after BASF's figures last Thursday.
Brokers expect Hoechst's pre-tax profits, due on Wednesday, to be about
DM1bn (Pounds 420m) for the half, compared with DM781m for the same period
last year. The first-quarter figure was up 16 per cent.
For Bayer, which reports on Thursday, estimates are around DM1.7bn pre-tax,
compared with DM1.41bn. The first-quarter rise was 18 per cent.
Analysts expect the two companies to be helped by good volume gains,
particularly from overseas. Hoechst, which is more exposed to the cyclical
plastics market, should also benefit from the start of the turnround in
petrochemicals.
Bayer has little plastics manufacturing, but should post an upturn in
intermediates volumes and prices.
Both companies will continue to suffer from the healthcare reforms announced
in Europe during the past week, although the German market is beginning to
recover, albeit from a low base.
Analysts will also be watching the results of the agrochemicals operations,
which have suffered in the past two years from the impact of the EU's Common
Agricultural Policy.

Lac Minerals, the Canadian mining group which is the target of two unwelcome
takeover offers, will be forced to dissolve its protection plan, or poison
pill, if either of the bids is accepted by its shareholders.
The Ontario Securities Commission said after two days of hearings that it
will order Lac to remove the poison pill if either of the rival suitors, the
Toronto-based gold producer American Barrick or Royal Oak Mines of
Vancouver, attracts more than 66 per cent of Lac's shares.
Royal Oak's CDollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.1bn) bid is due to expire tomorrow,
while Barrick's CDollars 2.1bn offer expires on Friday. Both are conditional
on acceptance by holders of two-thirds of Lac's shares.
The poison pill allows Lac's directors to issue large amounts of stock to
existing shareholders at a deep discount in the event of a predator
acquiring a stake of more than 15 per cent.
Lac has so far tried to convince shareholders that their interests would be
best served by allowing it to remain independent.
Mr Jim Pitblado, chairman, told the OSC that Lac has talked to other
potential suitors, but that it could be two or three weeks before another
bid materialises. He declined to give details of these talks.
Royal Oak and Barrick contend that Lac's directors have had enough time to
find a 'white knight' since Royal Oak made its first offer on July 7.
According to the two suitors, Lac's shareholders should now be allowed to
decide the company's fate.
Analysts give Barrick a higher chance of success than Royal Oak, despite the
lower face value of its bid.
Both companies have offered a combination of cash and shares, but Barrick's
paper is widely regarded as more attractive and liquid than Royal Oak, which
is a much smaller company with relatively high-cost mines.
Royal Oak raised the cash component of its offer earlier this month.
The fact that Barrick has not responded is taken as a sign that Mr Peter
Munk, its chairman and controlling shareholder, remains confident of most
Lac shareholders' support.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Israeli shares fall 10% on tax fears
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Israel's stock market slid almost 10 per cent yesterday amid frantic trading
by investors nervous about a proposed new tax on share profits. At the close
of trading the benchmark Mishtanim index of the top 100 blue chip companies
had fallen 18.22 points, or 9.93 per cent, to 165.18. Many smaller stocks on
the Karam index fell 15-20 per cent.
The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange suspended a rule which allows for a halt to
normal trading if shares in any company fluctuate more than 10 per cent in a
day. Trading was also extended beyond the normal closing time.
Officials said these exceptional moves were taken to encourage a once-off
'definitive readjustment', and to allow the market to establish an
equilibrium.
Analysts said the record wave of selling worth about Shk600m (Pounds 128m)
was the worst single day for the market since the banks shares collapse of
1983. They believe the market panicked after the Treasury closed the
exchange for two days last week and announced a 10 per cent capital gains
tax of share profits from next January 1.
Although the cabinet modified the proposal yesterday allowing investors to
offset some of the tax against losses, market experts said investors were
still jittery and expected the effective rate of taxation to be around 18
per cent.
Mr David Rosenberg, a market analyst at Pacific Mediterranean Investments,
said the assumption before yesterday's trading was that the market would be
discounted by 10 per cent - the face value of the new tax. But he predicted
further declines this week as investors assessed the effective rate of tax
they would have to pay. 'It is true that there has been panic, heavy trading
and mutual fund redemptions today but so far the effects have been at the
more positive or low side of expectations,' he said. 'Hopefully we have seen
the major technical correction and further declines won't be substantial.'
Before yesterday the market had fallen 25 per cent this year from its peak
of 258 points in January because of poor company results, higher than
expected inflation, interest rate rises and a clean-up campaign by the
Securities Authority which resulted in several arrests. Fears about
inflation, currently about 14 per cent, and another rise in interest rates
could further depress the market.

FT  22 AUG 94 / China tightens credit to curb inflation rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By:BY TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China is to clamp down on loans for capital spending, following the release
of figures that showed an alarming 73 per cent rise in fixed asset
investment in July compared with the same month last year.
Central bank officials have made clear that credit ceilings would be
tightened in the third quarter after an easing in the past few months to
accommodate the demands of state enterprises for working capital.
Mr Zhou Zhengqing, a deputy governor of the People's Bank, was quoted as
saying that 'banks must strictly adhere to credit ceilings in order to
control lending for fixed asset investments'.
Beijing has announced that it will review all new capital spending projects
under the state plan, and those that 'do not enjoy good prospects' will be
cancelled.
The official Xinhua news agency quoted government officials as emphasising
the need to 'check excessive capital construction in order to avoid economic
disorder'.
Government attempts to curb fixed asset investment by state enterprises
reflects continuing concern over inflation, which began to climb again in
June and July after previously declining.
Consumer prices in China's 35 main cities rose by 22.7 per cent in July
compared with the same month last year. This was the same as the June
figure, but was higher than May.
The authorities blamed a capital spending binge last year for inflationary
pressures. A stabilisation plan, introduced in July 1993, was aimed at
calming an overheating economy and curbing investment in fixed assets.
Chinese officials, including Mr Zhu Rongji, senior vice-premier in charge of
the economy, have been meeting at the beach resort of Beidaihe near Beijing
to review economic developments.
Central bank officials said that among targets in the latest crackdown on
unauthorised lending would be illegal interbank transactions. Non-bank
financial institutions would also come under greater scrutiny.
Adding to official concern is the fact that capital spending normally grows
faster in the second half of the year, with the third quarter the peak
period for starting new projects. Chinese economists attributed the jump in
capital spending in July to projects launched by state enterprises whose
financial position had improved.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Planned nuclear station 'a threat to coal industry'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Coal warns today that a planned nuclear power station on the Suffolk
coast would displace up to 9m tonnes of coal a year, and it expresses strong
doubts about the nuclear industry's ability to deliver electricity at the
costs it promises.
Nine million tonnes is a significant proportion of the coal industry likely
to survive into the early years of the next century, the soonest the new
station, Sizewell C, could come on stream.
Some coal industry analysts believe that total output of the coal industry
by 2000 is likely to be under 40m tonnes. British Coal's warning, in a
submission to the government's nuclear review, represents a strong rebuff to
Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, the two main nuclear generators.
They have argued that the coal and nuclear industries are a good
environmental fit and that gas-fired generation is the cause of coal's
contraction. Nuclear Electric has already applied for planning permission to
build Sizewell C, subject to the outcome of the nuclear review.
Nuclear Electric argues that Sizewell C's electricity will replace power
from Magnox nuclear stations, due to be retired over the next decade.
British Coal says that past decisions to invest in nuclear power have been
based on optimistic forecasts 'which were subsequently seen to have been
misplaced'.
Nuclear Electric, in its submission to the nuclear review, said it could
produce electricity from the 2,600MW Sizewell C at 3.7p per unit assuming an
11 per cent return on capital.
British Coal says the likely economic cost of Sizewell C could be 5p or 6p
per kilowatt hour.
'Without government underwriting, risk-averse investors would undoubtedly
seek a higher rate of return, even if they would invest at all. The
resulting estimates of generating costs would be much higher (than 6p).'
British Coal's analysis suggests that a new 'clean coal' power plant could
offer a power cost of 3p to 4p a unit. Smaller stations could produce at
less than that.
British Coal argues that there are no compelling reasons for the government
to back a new nuclear plant on grounds of diversity, security of supply or
environmental considerations.
The nuclear companies have conceded that new plants would need government
support if they were to go ahead.
British Coal argues that if the government departs from its free market
principles it should defer any decision until the performance of Sizewell B,
on which Sizewell C will be modelled, can be evaluated.
Sizewell B is expected to start producing electricity later this year.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Swiss army knives cut no ice with US court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Where does the Swiss army knife come from? According to a US appeal court
judgment, the knife of many parts can come from any country, since the words
'Swiss army' describe a type of knife and are not 'location-specific'.
The ruling has angered Swiss producers of the genuine article, who are under
attack from cheap red Chinese imitations and claim there has been
trespassing on their intellectual property.
'The Americans make such a fuss about protecting consumers and intellectual
property rights, and then they do this. We were very upset,' said Maurice
Cachot, chief executive of Wenger, one of the two companies that supply the
pocket knives to the Swiss army.
Wenger and Victorinox, the other Swiss maker, say they are not particularly
worried about competition from the cheap Chinese imitations because they say
the Chinese knives are obviously of inferior quality.
What does worry them is that the judgment is a licence to precision
manufacturers in Japan, Germany, Britain and other industrialised countries,
which could make a better job of imitating the Swiss article.
Consumer information is also an issue: a survey showed that most Americans
believe that when they buy a red, multi-gadget pocket knife they are buying
a Swiss product.
The Chinese set alarms ringing in the Alps two years ago by painting the
Swiss white cross symbol and the words 'Swiss army' on their exports to the
US.
The Swiss and their US distributors replied to this cheeky challenge with a
lawsuit in September 1992, accusing Arrow Trading, the US distributor for
the Chinese, of qualitatively and geographically false advertising.
They also won an injunction prohibiting Arrow from using the words 'Swiss
army' and the cross symbol until the case was decided.
A year later, they won their case, but then lost on appeal last month. As
well as ruling that 'Swiss army' was not location specific, the court said
Arrow's conduct in promoting its knives might be misleading.
It ordered a new hearing to resolve that issue.
The court also lifted the injunction against Arrow using the Swiss army name
and cross.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Opponents of Clinton crime bill make last assault
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Conservative Republicans and gun lobbyists yesterday mounted a final effort
to defeat a crime bill with a provision banning assault weapons and to deny
President Bill Clinton a victory he desperately needs to rescue his wobbling
presidency.
Mr Leon Panetta, the White House chief of staff, was unable to predict
victory in a vote scheduled for late afternoon. House Democrats and moderate
Republicans negotiated frantically through Saturday night, the result being
a bill that Mr Panetta contended was an improvement on the one which failed
on August 11, angering Mr Clinton.
To meet the demands of Republic moderates, the Democrats agreed to a
compromise which would cut Dollars 3.3bn from a Dollars 33.5bn bill and
eliminate or consolidate many of the 'crime prevention' social programmes
favoured by Mr Clinton. The proposed legislation retained the tougher
sentencing components, which the administration had hoped would attract
conservatives.
Funds to provide incentives so that local governments can hire 100,000 local
police - a Clinton campaign promise - were kept, and local governments were
given a greater say on how the funds would be spent. Negotiators agreed to
drop a youth jobs training programme which had been favoured by the
president.
Democrats and Republican negotiators laboured on through the weekend as two
threats to the legislation emerged.
A rival bill was introduced by the conservatives and gun lobby. It contained
no social programmes and excluded the ban on assault weapons. Mr Newt
Gingrich, the combative conservative Republican leader, supported this
alternative, saying he liked its stronger capital punishment provisions.
The Clinton compromise, supported by Republican moderates, was also
threatened by loss of support by House liberals - members of the Black
caucus in particular - who were unhappy about the dropping of the social
programmes, which had initially attracted their support. Congress has been
trying to pass a major crime bill for six years.

FT  22 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sometimes there is no pleasing the gilts market. Last week was packed with
good news but prices ended almost unchanged. The better than expected retail
price inflation figures received a small round of applause and the US
interest rate increase was welcomed. The Bank of England also obliged by
saying that, following the good public sector borrowing figures, there would
not be a gilts auction this month. But all was drowned out by the
Bundesbank's decision to hold its interest rates unchanged.
Gilts were particularly vulnerable to the ensuing disappointment because the
yield spread compared with German bunds had narrowed significantly this
month. It had dropped from around 180 basis points to 150, but ended the
week at its recent average of 165. With volumes thin at the moment, the
relapse reflected only a handful of trades.
The excellent outlook for UK inflation and interest rates would seem to
justify a reduction in the spread, though not to the 40 basis points gap
that prevailed at the end of January. But the German institutions that were
prominent in selling gilts last week are probably more concerned about
renewed sterling risk. Concern that German interest rates are at or near
their bottom also unnerved bunds and had a knock-on effect on gilts.
Meanwhile, the prospect of a surge in supply of bunds hung over the market:
the German government has raised only a net 10 per cent of its funding
requirement so far this year. The spread against bunds may have to narrow
just for gilts to stand still.

Equity markets now view pharmaceuticals companies as either predators or
prey. Among those most likely to make a strategic acquisition, Glaxo has
barely kept pace with the UK market during the past few months. Yet Wellcome
has outperformed by 45 per cent since the end of April, when Roche made its
agreed bid for Syntex, fuelled by speculation that it might attract similar
interest. In the US, Eli Lilley and Marion Merrell Dow are among the
possible targets.
Consolidation certainly looks overdue. The world's top 10 drugs companies
account for less than one-third of industry sales. Such fragmentation
suggests that healthcare buyers and shareholders are supporting excessive
overheads. The large premium paid by Roche - and by American Home Products
in its unsolicited bid for American Cyanamid - only makes sense if cost
savings can be achieved. Similar efficiencies across the industry would help
protect margins at a time when drugs prices are falling.
The worry is that organisations that rely on scientific and marketing flair
do not react well to rough restructuring. Neither are most drug company
managements proven in the area of takeovers. The most rational solution
would be a second wave of agreed mergers, like those which created
SmithKline Beecham and Bristol Myers Squibb. Such combinations could deliver
the same benefits as takeovers in terms of efficiency with fewer risks. The
snag is that the instant gratification priced into the shares of many drug
companies would have to be foregone.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PowerGen has firmly established itself as the shareholders' darling among
Britain's generators. Though its shares and National Power's were sold at
the same price in 1991, PowerGen's are now trading at a 15 per cent premium.
Only last April, its larger rival held a slight edge.
National Power seeks to blame the discrepancy on the companies' different
starting points at privatisation. Differences there undoubtedly were -
PowerGen has, for example, had to spend less than expected on cleaning up
its coal-fired stations.
But it would be hard to attribute all or even most of the share price
divergence to something that dates back so long. A better explanation is
that National Power has worried shareholders with its ambitions for
investing Pounds 1bn in overseas power stations.
There is nothing wrong with National Power's global strategy per se. In
fact, it is easier to see what value National Power adds to generating
projects in the developing world than what PowerGen brings to its
investments in North Sea gas. The snag is that the strategy will take a long
time to develop and, in the meantime, National Power is generating cash at a
prodigious rate. The danger is that, with so much cash coming in, management
will adopt a less discriminating approach to foreign investment.
Shareholders would feel more comfortable if the company followed PowerGen's
recent example of buying back its own shares. National Power would still
have no trouble financing worthwhile projects and should see the gap between
its share price and PowerGen's narrowing.

FT  22 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Nigeria's crude truths
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The oil market is taking a fairly sanguine view about Nigeria. The Brent
crude price, which shot up to Dollars 19 a barrel at the start of the month
when worries about the oil workers' strike were at their peak, has fallen
back below Dollars 17. Traders are heartened by the fact that the strike has
cut Nigerian supply by only about 20 per cent. With the political crisis in
Nigeria worsening, such an analysis may look complacent. In the worst case,
the ethnic rivalry now being stoked up between the Yoruba tribe from the
south and the Hausas from the north could spill over into civil war. Even if
this can be avoided, the negotiating positions of General Sani Abacha and
Chief Moshood Abiola are so entrenched that an early resolution of the
conflict is unlikely.
Nevertheless, there is hard-nosed realism in the oil market's analysis. So
far the strikers have been treated relatively leniently. But so dependent is
Gen Abacha's regime on oil revenues that stepped-up strike action is likely
to provoke tougher measures to keep the oil flowing. And the government's
ability to achieve this should not be doubted. Angola, which managed to
expand oil production sharply during its civil war, is a telling parallel.
Further supply shocks in Nigeria would of course affect crude prices but a
bigger determinant is likely to be what happens to world oil demand. After
signs that US demand was flagging in July, the latest figures show it
picking up. If the stronger economic growth in continental Europe spills
over into oil demand, Brent could push up to Dollars 19 again.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Leading Article: A-levels fail the test of time
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's A-level examinations, increasingly regarded as a curiosity by the
rest of the world, have remained untouched during the past six years, while
every other aspect of the school system in England and Wales has been
subjected to radical reform. The furious reaction from employers'
organisations which greeted last week's A-level results will, with luck,
finally convince the government that they need reform. Such reform will be
at least six years too late.
The precipitate fall in the numbers taking maths and science has aroused the
greatest ire among employers. The decline in both maths and physics was more
than five per cent for the second year running, while the numbers with the
combination of subjects needed for most university science and engineering
courses has dropped by 40 per cent in a decade.
The employers who claim to be so angered by this might consider whether one
explanation for the unpopularity of science degrees lies in the pay signals
they themselves provide. But they are right to say that A-levels have
exacerbated the problem.
By forcing 16-year-olds to choose only three subjects, A-levels entrench
specialisation. They make it impossible to gain a sound grounding in the
sciences without abandoning arts and the humanities altogether - a step many
students are understandably reluctant to take.
Gold standard
The government's defence, that A-levels are an 'educational gold standard',
is weak. No system which allows 16-year-olds to drop sciences or languages
altogether can be called 'golden' by any standards.
However, A-levels have some features worth preserving. They are widely
respected, despite the sharp improvement in pass rates of the past few
years; they are rigorous; and they are independently assessed. Useful reform
can be achieved without compromising any of these virtues.
Slimming A-level syllabuses so that five subjects becomes a feasible norm
for each candidate offers the simplest and most effective way to do this.
The level of academic rigour would remain the same in each case. Academics
believe that a five A-level system could be implemented by cutting the
content of each syllabus by 20 per cent, and by reforming the sixth-form
timetable so that students spend more time in lessons.
Mixed economy
With five subjects, sixth-formers could maintain an interest in arts and
literature while taking the mathematics and two sciences needed to keep a
science degree as a viable option. It would also be easier to operate a
'mixed economy' of traditional academic A-levels and vocational
qualifications. The government currently hopes that students will consider
taking A-levels alongside the new General National Vocational Qualification
(GNVQ). Dubbed the 'Vocational A-level' by former education secretary Mr
John Patten, a GNVQ is intended to be equal in value to two A-levels.
The problem is that it is difficult to take the current unwieldy A-levels
alongside a GNVQ. With slimmed syllabuses and five subjects as the norm,
however, students could take three A-levels on top of their vocational
training. A further worthwhile reform would bring vocational qualifications
within the A-level framework, provided they were subjected to a similar
level of rigorous external assessment as academic A-levels.
But the chief virtue of this plan is that it needs only incremental changes
to the system already in place. This is far preferable to the seismic change
which was involved in introducing the national curriculum.
Why has the government held back? Sheer embarrassment may be part of the
problem. A five A-level system was first proposed by the Higginson report,
commissioned by Mr Kenneth Baker when education secretary in 1987. It is
still endorsed by universities. But the then prime minister, Mrs Thatcher,
promptly rejected its findings when it was published, and it has been
gathering dust for six years.
It is now plain that failure to implement the report's proposals at the time
was a grievous mistake. But if the government continues to avoid taking
action, it will only compound its error.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Leading Article: A new deal for Cuba
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The tightening of the US economic embargo on Cuba, announced this weekend,
is a step in precisely the wrong direction. By further isolating its
neighbour, the US is intensifying economic misery in Cuba. This will
increase the flood of refugees attempting to leave the island, which will
make further difficulties for the Clinton administration. It will also allow
Fidel Castro to deflect blame for the country's dire economic circumstances
from himself, where it belongs, to Washington.
The present exodus from Cuba should show him that fundamental change must
come soon. His dictatorship of 35 years is an anachronism in a continent of
elected governments. He has succeeded in extending literacy and reducing
infant mortality. Yet in the absence of eastern bloc subsidies and trade,
the failures of Cuba's centrally planned economy have become painfully
clear. National income has almost halved during the last three years. An aid
agency recently estimated that the average Cuban eats about 1,000 fewer
calories per day than in 1989, pushing many towards starvation.
Hardship and repression have caused rising discontent. During recent
protests, the worst in the regime's history, demonstrators chanted 'freedom'
and 'down with Fidel'.
Civil unrest
The question is no longer whether change will come to Cuba, but how. There
is little cause for complacency on the part of the Clinton administration.
Deteriorating conditions will produce increasing civil unrest and a
worsening exodus to the US. Presumably, the US sees itself as tightening the
economic noose around Castro's neck, creating the conditions for his
overthrow. But given the country's lack of democratic tradition, there are
no guarantees that a change of regime will mean the advent of democracy.
Already this year, more than 6,000 Cuban refugees have entered the US, twice
the number in 1993. Ideological protestation aside, the US is no more
interested in absorbing refugees from post-communist turmoil in the western
hemisphere than is the EU in accepting refugees from eastern Europe. The
White House has responded to Castro's apparent decision to let Cubans leave
with a virtual blockade around Florida.
Rather than encouraging a violent outcome to the Cuban crisis, the US should
end its blanket isolation of the Castro regime and offer a series of
incentives for economic and political liberalisation. Cuba has taken halting
and inadequate steps towards economic reform. The dollar has been
reluctantly legalised, and some private enterprise is now allowed. Greater
communication with the island would strengthen this liberalisation process.
For example, Cuba has granted several US telecommunication companies the
right to link the two countries, but they still await the Clinton
administration's approval. Cold war regulations restricting Cuban
journalists in the US should also be repealed.
Encouraging reformers
Reformers within the government must be encouraged. The US should end
embargoes on food and medicine, and if reform continues, it should permit
Cuba's entrance into the World Bank and IMF. Liberalisation needs to yield
results, otherwise Castro may be able to blame the reformers for Cuba's
economic misery.
US policy is unlikely to change without corresponding movement within the
Cuban-American community, long the primary force behind America's
uncompromising stance. Although the most powerful Cuban-American
organisation, the Cuban American National Foundation (CANF), still supports
the embargo, alternative voices are emerging. The newly-formed Cuban
Committee for Democracy supports the recently introduced Free Trade with
Cuba Act. The Clinton administration's first nominee for under-secretary for
Inter-American Affairs, Afro-Cuban exile Mario Baeza, was blocked by CANF
because he appeared too open to dialogue with the Castro regime.
The stand-off between Cuba and the US remains one of the cold war's most
painful legacies. The past's scars, however, must not prevent a pragmatic
assessment the present predicament. For Cuba, that means reforms to arrest
its political and economic slide. For the US, it means encouraging that to
happen.

FT  22 AUG 94 / A ring that sounds like profit: China's decision to
establish a second telephone network means big opportunities for western
telecommunications companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China's decision last month to sanction a second telephone network to
compete with the state monopoly marks a radical shift in policy, and one
that should bring substantial benefits to international suppliers of
telecommunications equipment now crowding a market worth billions of dollars
a year.
Beijing says the competing network, to be known as China United
Telecommunications, or China Unicom, will help 'accelerate' the development
of the telecommunications sector to cope with the demands of a rapidly
modernising economy whose orderly growth is being constrained by poor
communications, especially to outlying regions.
The decision to open the telecommunications sector to competition followed a
long and bruising debate within the Chinese bureaucracy. The Ministry of
Posts and Telecommunications had fought to preserve its monopoly, but was
forced to give ground to a powerful coalition of interests involving three
ministries - of the railways, the electronics industry and electric power.
These are China Unicom's main partners among 17 shareholders, which include
several of China's main state-owned corporations.
China Unicom faces formidable obstacles, however, in 'grafting' a second
network on to existing facilities in spite of the significant assets brought
to bear by the state bodies involved in the project. Both the Ministry of
Railways and Ministry of Electric Power presently operate their own
communications networks, necessitated by primitive existing
telecommunications.
The Ministry of Railways, for example, owns 22,000 miles of above-ground
lines, 19,000 miles of coaxial cable and 1,900 miles of optical-fibre cable.
Aside from these cable facilities, the ministry, whose reach extends to most
corners of China, has set up numerous microwave links plus switching
capacity for 400,000 telephone lines.
Likewise, the Ministry of Electric Power owns 17,000 miles of digital
microwave links. 'All of these private networks have spare capacity which
could be made available to the public,' says Mr He Fei Chang, director of
telecommunications at the Ministry of Electronics, one of China Unicom's
partners.
China's need for a crash programme to modernise its telecommunications has
not been in doubt for years, but the best means of achieving a more rapid
extension of services has been the subject of endless debate since the
1980s. Then it became clear that, unless huge investment was made, the
system would continue to fall far short of China's requirements well into
the next century.
This debate was sharpened by the publication in 1992 of a comprehensive
World Bank study of China's telecommunications sector* which found that the
country's telephone system is 'among the least developed in Asia relative to
population size, and service quality is low'.
It reported: 'Public telephones are virtually non-existent. Networks are
heavily congested, making it almost impossible to communicate by telephone
during peak business hours. Long delays are experienced in long-distance
telephone calls . . . While some of the world's most advanced technologies
are being introduced in the fastest-growing parts of the network, old and
obsolete plant is still widespread.'
Among the World Bank's main themes was the need for competition. But at that
stage the bank did not envisage anything as ambitious as building a second
network. Such a bold move would not, in any case, have been possible before
China embarked on the latest, accelerated phase of economic reform heralded
by a visit to southern China in early 1992 by Mr Deng Xiaoping, the
country's senior leader.
Mr Deng, known for his earthiness, gave a simple instruction to local
officials, which then became a slogan throughout China. 'Do it faster,' he
is reported to have said in reference to the need for a quickening of
China's economic growth. Since then China's economy has recorded growth
rates exceeding 13 per cent a year and investment in telecommunications has
risen sharply. Indeed, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, which
is due to spend Yn53.6bn (Dollars 6.23bn) on telecommunications this year,
achieved its planning targets for the current five-year plan (1991-1995) by
1993, two years ahead of schedule.
Yet, for all the increase in expenditure and the fairly impressive spread of
services in coastal areas and larger cities, including dramatic improvements
in line quality, China's average national penetration rate (telephones per
100 persons) hovers around a minuscule 2.5 per cent. This compares with
rates of 60 per cent in most developed countries.
China plans to increase the number of telephone lines from the present 30m
to 110m by 2000, involving expenditure of Yn450bn and including some Dollars
7bn in loans from abroad. This would provide a penetration rate of 8 per
cent, still low by international standards and those of its Asian
neighbours, though it would represent a big leap for China. Western
telecommunications experts say the magnitude of the task can be gauged from
the fact that, if China holds to its plans of installing between 10m and 11m
lines a year for the rest of the century, this would be equivalent to
installing Britain's telephone network every three years.
Among China's many difficulties in bridging the gulf between supply and
demand is one of distribution. While the official figure for existing
capacity is 30m lines, only about 17m have actually been connected,
according to some western estimates. 'It's one thing to install switching
equipment; it's quite another to get a line to a house or a factory,' says a
western telecommunications expert in Beijing.
The huge technical and logistical problems involved in extending a telephone
network throughout China with its 1.2bn people and thousands of cities,
towns and hamlets is the main reason why powerful figures in the leadership
backed the establishment of Unicom. Such a gargantuan task is simply beyond
the capacity of a single organisation. Both Mr Zhu Rongji, the senior
vice-premier in charge of the economy, and Mr Zou Jiahua, a vice-premier
responsible for the telecommunications sector, are solidly behind the Unicom
proposal.
One of the most telling arguments in favour of promoting competition was
that it would vastly improve access to telephones by communities in more
remote areas, and thus help to slow the widening economic and social gap
between coastal regions and the hinterland. The Ministry of Railways, for
example, with its extensive existing network could deliver services in
far-flung areas like Yunnan in the south west and Xinjiang in the west.
Competition, the authorities say, would also help to reduce the cost of
telecommunications services which are among the most expensive in the world.
Installation fees in the cities are running at about Yn6,000 and in rural
areas at Yn3,000. This is three to four times the cost of a phone
installation in the UK, and perhaps as much as eight times that in the US.
While Chinese officials say they are keen to promote telecommunications
competition, they are also making it clear this will not extend to allowing
foreign participation in the operation of networks for the foreseeable
future. Indeed Vice-Premier Zou, announcing the decision to allow a second
network, stressed that China Unicom was a pilot project and that no other
corporations would be authorised to operate telecommunications services.
Foreigners would be restricted to supplying equipment and technical advice
to the new network and possibly taking some form of equity participation at
a future date.
In spite of the looming threat from Unicom, telecommunication ministry
officials are seeking to put the best face on the loss of their monopoly,
insisting competition is in the interests of all. But there is also no doubt
they are apprehensive about the practicalities of making the new dual system
work. Not least among the ministry's concerns are the technical difficulties
involved in achieving an interface between parallel networks.
Unicom will be obliged to piggy-back on the existing system run by the
telecommunications ministry in much the same way as the new Optus network in
Australia is joined to the state-owned system.
Other ministry concerns include regulating competition in a new, more
free-wheeling telecommunications sector - it is both regulator and provider
through its subsidiaries - in the absence of a telecommunications law (one
is still in the drafting stage). Officials also anticipate problems over
sharing scarce resources such as technical staff.
Mr Xu Shanyan, the telecommunications ministry's chief spokesman, describes
these as 'unresolved issues' and says they will require careful study and
discussion in the implementation phase.
Since Unicom will depend heavily on the telecommunications ministry in the
start-up phase, officials of the new network are careful to stress their
desire to avoid duplication and keep competition within limits.
Mr Zhao Weichen, chairman of Unicom, says the network will 'engage in
wide-ranging co-operation and co-development' by adhering to what he
described as a policy of 'five expansions'. These include an expansion of
co-operation with domestic and international networks 'within the scope
permitted by Chinese government policy'.
But western observers are sceptical about declarations that the new network
will not engage in fierce competition. 'China Unicom is meant to restrict
its activities and not to compete directly with the telecommunications
ministry, but in practice they will obviously compete,' says a
representative of a Western telecommunications corporation.
China Unicom's plans are certainly ambitious. Its development targets for
the rest of this century include providing 12m new lines, which will
increase the nation-wide telephone penetration rate by 1 percentage point;
and acquiring a 10 per cent share of national and international trunk
traffic plus 30 per cent of the mobile telephone market with services in
more than 100 cities.
The new network also plans to develop the manufacturing capacity of the
Ministry of Electronics Industry, one of its three founding partners. This
will bring the electronics ministry into direct competition with the
telecommunications ministry, whose subsidiaries are heavily engaged in
foreign joint ventures manufacturing telecommunications equipment, including
switching gear and optical fibre cable.
Recent reports of a glut in the supply of optical fibre cable due to excess
manufacturing capacity should cause some hesitation among prospective new
entrants in what is becoming a highly competitive market. But all the signs
are that the world's telecommunications giants are pursuing the China market
as if the question is not whether they can afford to be participants but
whether they can afford not to be.
Without exception, companies such as AT&amp;T and Motorola of the US, Alcatel of
France, Northern Telecom of Canada, Siemens of Germany, Ericsson of Sweden,
NEC and Fujitsu of Japan, Nokia of Finland, and GPT, the UK-based supplier,
are engaged in joint ventures in China. The advent of a second network -
which will vastly increase demand for all manner of equipment including
switching gear, transmission lines, communications software and cellular
phones - could hardly have come at a more advantageous moment for the
world's big telecommunications manufacturers.
Mr Chisun Lai, Motorola's chief representative in Beijing, summed up the
favourable industry view when he said of the decision to sanction a second
network: 'What China has done is help speed up the market development of the
telecommunications industry with additional operators and networks. This is
certainly positive for the industry and positive for companies involved in
that industry.'

Britain's Royal Mail is already starting to behave as if it has been
privatised judging by the latest edition of its Royal Mail International
Business Travel Guide.
Not only is Ireland portrayed as a more enthusiastic member of the European
Union than Britain, but the guide also criticises the British government's
efforts to settle the 25-year-old troubles. It notes that in the autumn of
1993, a new initiative jointly presented by the moderate nationalist SDLP
and the republican Sinn Fein seemed to offer 'at least the possibility of a
settlement'. That said, the attitude of the British government is described
as 'unpromising'.

Excitement is running high among dealers at the Frankfurt stock exchange -
and not solely on account of the D-Mark's gyrations. The fuss concerns a
broker who is retiring - and his would-be replacement, August Schafer.
Schafer is the state commissioner responsible for supervising the bourse.
With the new financial supervisory laws, he has more or less regulated
himself out of a job and is looking for pastures new.
However, potential future colleagues reckon that the aptly named Schafer
(meaning shepherd) knows a mite too much about them and their ways to be a
suitable member of their flock. For his part, Schafer claims his second name
is discretion and insists on pressing his case.
But why is he so eager? Does he not appreciate that, given his provenance
from the old school of toothless watchdogs, those bleaters on the floor will
eat him alive?

Good news for barbecue-owners. The Minneapolis Grain Exchange is planning to
launch a black tiger shrimp futures contract later this year. When used in
conjunction with an existing contract on white shrimp, it should now be
possible to buy and sell contracts covering around 90 per cent of world's
shrimps. With 300 investors playing the white shrimp contract, it seems only
a matter of time before some big fish start chasing up the black tiger

Is Sir Paul Newall, the globe-trotting Lord Mayor of London, trying to set

before planned visits to Muscat, Jordan, Kuwait and Strasbourg.
If he goes on like this the City Corporation might have to invest in a
corporate jet to cut down on the cost of flying him and his entourage around
the world. His latest trip is no sun-seeking sojourn, however, given the
13-city, 20-day itinerary planned to promote Britain and the City and to

He enjoys banging the drum and wishes more would join in. Having finally got
his knighthood, a lesser figure might have eased up a bit so that he could
enjoy entertaining at home in the Mansion House. Not so, Sir Paul. Let's
hope his successor is as diligent.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Observer: Like father, like son?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
James Packer, Cameron O'Reilly and now Lachlan Murdoch. One by one the next
generation of media tycoons are being tested out quietly in various parts of
their families' Australian newspaper businesses.
When Rupert Murdoch took the helm of the struggling Adelaide News in 1953
few would have predicted that he would end up far more powerful than his
late father, Sir Keith Murdoch. The same goes for Kerry Packer who inherited
Consolidated Press from Sir Frank Packer. Despite being a ferocious gambler,
he is now Australia's richest man and few dare cross him.
Will James Packer, or Lachlan Murdoch, out-shine their fathers? Cameron
O'Reilly, 29, who runs Tony O'Reilly's Australian Provincial Newspapers, has
the least downside risk. His father is a recent entrant to the media game
and has yet to make his mark. Jamie Packer, 26, has an advantage in that he
is Kerry Packer's only son and heir to a fortune estimated at Dollars 2.3bn.
However, the speed with which young Warwick Fairfax lost his family business
shows what can happen to prodigal sons.
Princeton-educated Lachlan Murdoch, 22, who starts today as general manager
of Queensland Newspapers, is not the first Murdoch offspring in the family
business. Elisabeth, 26, his elder sister, runs a couple of TV stations in
the US, and another brother, James, 21, is still at Harvard. However,
Lachlan has been put to work in a part of the group which has always been
close to the heart of his father and grand-father, and he will be watched
over by Ken Cowley, one of Rupert Murdoch's most trusted lieutenants.
Which of the three will stay the course, let alone win the race to inherit
their families' growing media empires, is anybody's guess. But it will be
fun to watch.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK scoreboard is just a starting
point for research on company R&amp;D spend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL KENWARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It may help to pass the time for Dr Alan Smith ('Flaws inherent in R&amp;D
scoreboard', August 17) and Dennis Henry ('Added value should be real value
for R&amp;D', August 1) to shoot holes in the 'UK R&amp;D Scoreboard', but they seem
to miss the point.
I cannot speak for Company Reporting or the Department of Trade and Industry
 -I merely write the introduction to the scoreboard in an attempt to provide
some light relief from the tables of data - but as a long-time consumer of
such data, I see the scoreboard as a beginning rather than an end.
It is yet another source of information that an observer can use when trying
to compare and contrast companies.
Alan Smith seems to say that the only thing that matters is added value. He
then goes on to say that this is 'not something that can be measured easily
and quickly'. This comes after he accuses companies of accounting for R&amp;D in
diverse ways.
Imagine the fun and games that would ensue when trying to agree a definition
of added value.
The way to benchmark companies and their R&amp;D performance is to look at their
operation in depth, not at tables of numbers. The numbers can, though, be a
starting point. You need them before you can ask questions about added
value.
Alan Smith says that he is happy to support the R&amp;D scoreboard if it is
'going to encourage companies to spend more on R&amp;D'.
Surely the point is not to persuade companies to spend more, but to convince
them that they should look intelligently at their R&amp;D spending, perhaps with
the aid of tools like the scoreboard, to see how it compares with that of
others in their sector.
They might then realise that R&amp;D is something that they can manage in the
same way that they manage other aspects of their businesses.
Added value is but one way of looking at performance. Many companies look at
their performance in terms of quality and 'time to market' as much as added
value.
They should apply the same criteria to their R&amp;D spending.

FT  22 AUG 94 / The empire that can't fight back: Russia's yen for influence
in the former Soviet Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia yesterday commemorated the third anniversary of the 1991 attempted
coup when hard-liners tried to stop the Soviet Union from falling apart.
But those Muscovites who braved the rainy weather to join a small
pro-democracy anniversary rally invoked little of the euphoria which
intoxicated Moscow three years ago as Russians defied the plotters and
rallied around President Boris Yeltsin.
Instead of exultation, the dominant mood in the former Soviet Union is of
nostalgia. Increasingly, Russians mourn the loss of their empire and
non-Russians in newly independent states look back longingly to the days
when their lives were constrained, but more economically secure.
Thus, General Valentin Varennikov, the only coup leader to choose to go to
trial, was triumphantly acquitted this month. With his call for the
recreation of the Soviet Union, he has been transformed from villain to
hero. Hard-line communists and other conservatives out-shouted the
pro-democracy rallies yesterday. Similar sentiments provide the power base
for the flamboyantly imperialist Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
But the spectre of a newly emboldened Russia which would seek to reconquer
by force the territories lost almost by accident, has not materialised.
While the pro-union rhetoric may be getting louder and finding a growing
constituency throughout the former USSR, it is apparent that the old empire
cannot easily be put back together again.
Overtly imperial actions - such as Moscow's quiet backing for pro-Russian
politicians in Azerbaijan and Tajikistan; or Russia's pressure on Georgia to
abandon its stalwart independence - have been limited to the southern
periphery, which Russia is not really sure it wants within its borders.
As far as the Slav heartland is concerned, bit by bit the imperial scare has
been replaced by a different perception, one assiduously promoted by Russia
itself - that far from Russia pursuing expansionist purposes, most of the
states of the former Soviet Union wish themselves to re-establish links with
it.
This view received great support from the victories, in the Ukrainian and
Belarussian presidential elections in July, of Leonid Kuchma and Alexander
Lukashenko - both running on tickets of closer union with Russia (in Mr
Lukashenko's case, of total union). As these new men gained power, Russia's
most distinguished living dissident and author, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, was
winding his way through his country by train, bringing to Moscow his
long-held belief that at least the Slav states of Russia, Ukraine and
Belarus should unite once more.
Mr Thomas Pickering, US ambassador to Russia, noted in a speech in the UK in
July that Russians feel that 'Russia is primus inter pares (that is, among
other former Soviet states) by virtue of geography, scale, tradition and
some not clearly defined right'. Another 'right' claimed by Russians, Mr
Pickering said, derived from the country's perceived obligation to protect
the interests of cousins beyond its frontiers - the millions of ethnic
Russians abroad.
These two 'rights' are strongly felt and strongly asserted: they are a major
and inhibiting factor in the politics of the surrounding states as much as
they are a matter of often chauvinistic assertion in Russia.
But, crucially, Mr Pickering added a third attribute of contemporary
Russians: a 'profound scepticism about direct intervention in disputes
beyond Russia's current borders'.
The point about Russian imperialist rhetoric is that, at present it remains
as rhetoric and is almost certainly designed to be so. The projection of
Russian power has shrivelled dramatically. The scale of this can be seen in
the fact that, only a year or two after it ceased to be a global superpower,
Russia was absorbed in a debate (overdrawn, but real) about whether or not
the country would survive in one part even though its boundaries were
already more limited than any time since the 18th century.
Russia no longer has the military, economic or political capacity to service
any lust to reabsorb. Further - and as important - the development of nation
states in those parts of the Soviet Union that have broken away is going on
willy nilly. Nothing has illustrated this tendency more pointedly than
recent events in Ukraine and Belarus. Both country's presidents, having been
elected on pro-Russian platforms, have become committed defenders of their
nations' independence.
One factor in this metamorphosis is the personal ambition of the two
leaders. As one voter reminded Mr Kuchma on the campaign trail, 'it is
better to be president of independent Ukraine than the governor of Little
Russia'. But there was also a paradox at the heart of the desire for
reunion, as expressed during the election campaigns. Co-existing with
nostalgia across the former Soviet Union for the Soviet past, when the
republics were part of a single state in which central planning provided a
stagnant but reliable standard of living, is another powerful impulse: the
determination by the states' governments and many ordinary people to build
modern, prosperous market economies.
This second current is inevitably at odds with the first, primarily because
Russia, far further along the reform trail than Ukraine or Belarus, is no
longer willing to sacrifice its natural resources or to break its budget for
the sake of close family ties with its neighbours. Market reform, which is
naturally a decentralising process even in states which stick together,
could not co-exist with immediate political and economic reunion.
The December 1991 agreement between the Belarussian, Russian and Ukrainian
presidents to form the Commonwealth of Independent States (and thus finally
to destroy the Soviet Union) is excoriated by many former Soviet citizens -
but they must live with its results. Differing rates of economic
development; the establishment of independent foreign and defence policies;
the growing expectation on the part of citizens that the national, rather
than the former imperial, centre is the effective locus for politics; the
vested interests of new national political and bureaucratic elites - all cut
against the urge for reabsorption. They make it clear that it would be a
vast, costly and probably bloody undertaking.
Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, head of the Yabloko parliamentary faction in the
Russian legislature and the most consistent proponent among democrats of a
re-union of the former USSR, is a weathervane in this regard. While he still
supports 'closer economic co-operation' he now believes that the political
and defence union, which he once strongly advocated, is no longer necessary.
For many countries, the independence of what had been part of them seemed
incongruous at the time of separation: Ireland for the British, Finland for
the Swedes, Slovakia for the Czechs. Often the larger country had a point:
independence made little economic sense and left resentful national
minorities within new borders. But it seems as if, once the national die is
cast, the road back is blocked.
If the former 'family of socialist peoples' is to meet again under a common
roof, the members must spend the same time and energy as their west European
neighbours in developing mechanisms and safeguards which ensure at least
formal equality in their deliberations. The rhetoric of conservatives
notwithstanding, the countries of the former Soviet Union seem as far away
from political union as western Europe was after the second world war.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Citizens' rights strong in Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms MARIA ANDRUSZKIEWICZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Chrystia Freeland in her article 'Court backs consumer rights' (August
4) claims incorrectly that 'the first legal blow in post-communist Russia
for consumer rights' was delivered on August 3 1994 when a Moscow court
ordered the retailer 'Kvikk' to award Mr P Gusev Rbs2.318m (Pounds 574).
The Moscow Consumers' Union (MCU) caused a minor sensation in the Russian
press when they won their first case in the Russian courts in 1988 on behalf
of a pensioner who had been sold a faulty refrigerator.
Since then, several hundred consumers have been awarded compensation and
damages in individual and class actions brought by member organisations of
the Inter-Republican Confederation of Consumer Societies in Russia and
Ukraine.
Exasperated Russian airline passengers were greatly cheered when the
Consumer Society of Ekaterinburg's chairman sued Aeroflot after a 21-hour
delay in a freezing Moscow departure lounge. The Inter-Republican
Confederation is now fighting to secure compensation for the families of
Russian victims of the Siberian air disaster.
The independent consumer movement in the Russian Federation is one of the
most active and positive forces for citizens' rights to emerge in the
post-communist era, and one of the few reliable defences against the
widespread corruption, speculation and fraud which characterise the Russian
economy at the present time.
While pleased that the Financial Times felt that Mr Gusev's victory merited
reporting, I would like to draw attention to the fact that Mr Gusev's
success is not the first of its kind. It follows many years of concerted
effort by Russian consumer activists who, in Russia's present business
climate, work for little remuneration and often at considerable personal
risk. They deserve recognition for their attempts to civilise the 'Wild
East'.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER BOIZOT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Following 12 days of strikes during the past 10 weeks it seems
incomprehensible that Railtrack management and senior union officials cannot
agree on a formula to end the dispute.
In the meantime, on strike days, business in central London is having to
tolerate even greater traffic congestion than normal and to cope with
staffing levels that are reduced anyway because of the holiday season.
As we are beginning to emerge from long-term recession the last thing the
business community or its customers need is the aggravation of intermittent
congestion, disruption and dislocation when using the road and rail systems.
What is lacking at present is good sound leadership. Therefore may I suggest
that as those leading the negotiations appear to have run out of ideas, they
give way to more inspired people from their management teams to bring this
deplorable state of affairs to an end.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Jackets come off: The row over the UK net book agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For 20 years, Cynthia and Tony Reavell have run a bookshop in Rye, East
Sussex - the kind of shop where visitors browse on rainy afternoons. The
recession made life hard, but they fear the next few years may be even
tougher.
The reason is last week's announcement by Sir Bryan Carsberg, UK
director-general of fair trading, that he was asking the restrictive
practices court (which rules whether agreements between companies are
anti-competitive) to review the net book agreement - the mechanism which
allows publishers to set retail prices of most books and prevent
discounting.
As pressure is growing from some retailers and publishers for the agreement
to be ended, and many bookshops circumvent it, Sir Bryan decided there was
now a strong case for it to be dismantled.
The agreement's demise could lead to the biggest upheaval in the UK book
trade for decades. Opponents, such as Mr Terry Maher, former chairman of
Pentos, the UK's second largest book retailer, say abolishing it would lead
to lower book prices, higher sales and a more vibrant industry.
But Mrs Reavell believes that if the court abolishes the agreement, hundreds
of shops like hers will no longer be able to compete with price-cutting
retail chains. 'It would be pretty disastrous,' she says. 'But we will not
go down without a fight.'
Since it was first signed in 1957, the net book agreement has allowed
publishers to set the retail price of titles they designate 'net' books  -
they currently choose to publish three-quarters of books sold in the UK
within the agreement. A retailer selling a book below the net price would
risk legal action from the publisher.
Such price-setting by producers was outlawed in most product areas by the
Resale Prices Act 1964. But a restrictive practices court ruling in the same
year exempted books from the provisions of the act on the grounds that the
net book agreement operated in the public interest.
The arguments the court used to justify its 1964 ruling are still employed
by the agreement's supporters today. They are based on the notion that books
are 'special', that their cultural and educational value means the number of
bookshops, publishers and titles available must be maximised.
'With the support of the agreement, the UK has possibly the finest and most
competitive retailing structure anywhere in the world,' says Mr Clive
Bradley, chief executive of the Publishers Association, which represents 80
per cent of publishers.
His association, along with the Booksellers Association, which represents 90
per cent of bookshops, offers grim warnings of what would happen if the
agreement were abolished:
Discounting by larger chains and non-specialist bookshops would reduce
profit margins throughout the industry and weaker retailers and publishers
would disappear.
Bookshops would carry narrower ranges, and fewer titles would be published.
Average prices of books would rise. If bestsellers were discounted,
publishers and booksellers would put up the price of other books to recoup
lost margins.
Opponents of the agreement counter such arguments by pointing out that the
book market has changed substantially since 1964. They point to the
consolidation that has occurred in book retailing and publishing. Two
retailers account for almost one-third of consumer book sales: WH Smith,
which runs Waterstones; and Pentos, owner of Dillons, Hatchards and Athena.
Many weaker booksellers and publishers have already disappeared, and those
that are left, which have invested in new technology and improved their
efficiency, are better placed to withstand the end of the agreement.
A still more powerful argument for abandoning the agreement, says Mr Julian
Rivers, Dillons group marketing director, is that allowing booksellers to
compete on price would increase the size of the book market. 'The ability to
discount prices would allow us to market far more effectively, and attract a
lot of people who currently never set foot in bookshops,' he says.
He says the argument that price-cutting on some books would lead to lower
margins (with the knock-on effects of higher prices for other books and
fewer books being published) is invalid, because it assumes little or no
growth in sales. He adds that Dillons' experiments with discounting of
non-net books led to a fourfold or fivefold increase in sales of the titles
involved.
Which side of the argument is right? In the unregulated US book market,
bestsellers are cheaper than in the UK, but the Publishers Association in
London says average book prices are similar to the UK's. Moreover, the
association says, not as many new titles are published in the US - fewer
than 60,000 in 1992, compared with 78,000 in the UK. Opponents of the net
book agreement suggest too many titles are published in the UK, often of
poor quality.
Whether or not the restrictive practices court rules against the agreement -
its decision could be more than a year away - there are signs that the
arrangement is already unravelling.
Bargain bookstores are proliferating, including those which specialise in
discounted non-net books and end-of-line titles, and retail outlets operated
by book clubs, whose membership structure means they are not subject to the
net book agreement. US-style warehouse clubs such as Costco are using
similar methods to discount books.
The commitment of large publishers may also be waning. Reed, the UK's third
biggest, withdrew from the agreement in 1991, and Mr Maher, the veteran
campaigner against the agreement, predicts other large groups will follow
before the end of the year.
The breakdown of the agreement would make the ruling of the restrictive
practices court less relevant, and would remove the cosy certainties of the
book industry during recent decades. But if that leads to a period of faster
growth in the book selling industry, visitors to Rye - and other small towns
 -would still have somewhere to spend rainy afternoons.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Britain needs broadband network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JONATHAN SOLOMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Harper's personal view on the UK superhighway ('Riding tandem
along UK superhighway', August 12) deserves national attention.
Society at large, and most immediately within the OECD world, faces a
challenge in how to reorganise itself as a necessary readjustment to the
shift in comparative advantage in many industrial and commercial sectors to
the Pacific Basin and Far East.
The introduction of universal broadband access is one of the essential
elements facilitating such a reorganisation. It would also provide the means
for the OECD world to create whole new market sectors exploiting broadband
applications as yet unimagined, and this would do more to generate new and
lasting employment opportunities than much on the current political agenda.
John Harper's recommendation that BT, Mercury, the cable companies and
others with an interest in introducing universal broadband access join
together to create a national broadband infrastructure separate from their
competing service companies is very sound and has a good tradition in the
history of international communications.
The carrier community is quite accustomed to joining together to build
common international infrastructure, whether submarine, cable or satellite,
and to compete sometimes viciously over this infrastructure for customer
service. Indeed, Intelsat and Inmarsat were founded by the carrier community
and their governments to share risks in introducing what was then new
technology with no certain market.
Why cannot the various carriers playing in the UK market do the same to
create the UK superhighway and why cannot the UK government and the industry
regulator Oftel provide the necessary incentives?
This is a national question requiring full national debate.

Last chance tonight at the Edinburgh Festival for dance-lovers to see Mark
Morris's life-enhancing 'L'Allegro' at the Festival Theatre; Lucinda Childs
and Merce Cunningham bring their companies to the Festival this week as
well. There will be three performances of Peter Stein's seven-and-a-half
hour production of Aeschylus's 'Oresteia' trilogy in the Murrayfield Ice
Rink. Performed by a Russian cast of actors in their native language, this
staging has been touring the world for several months. Other festival drama
this week includes Stephane Braunschweig's production of 'A Winter's Tale',
performed in French by the French National Drama Centre in Orlean; and the
Abbey Theatre, Dublin, in Patrick Mason's staging of one of JM Synge's
lesser-known plays, 'The Well of the Saints'.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Arts: Lightweight tribute to Sir Henry - Prom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY BYE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When, over 80 years ago, Sir Henry Wood confronted an unsuspecting Prom
audience with the world premiere of Schoenberg's five orchestral pieces, its
reaction was decidely frosty. Even today one can well sympathise:
Schoenberg's Expressionist masterwork has lost none of its explosive force
and capacity to unnerve. Indeed, he might well have subtitled it 'Fantasia
on themes by Freud', such is the unswerving accuracy with which he
translated modern man's deepest anxieties into vivid musical images. Its
reception at last Friday's BBC Symphony orchestra Prom, designed as a 50th
anniversary tribute to Sir Henry, proved, however, to be a much more
sanguine affair.
No doubt Andrew Davis's rather lightweight direction, a model of misplaced
propriety, had something to do with it, minimising Schoenberg's abrupt
juxtapositions and some eruptions of some unmotivated violence and bringing
consolation, where, none, surely, is meant. At times, one could even detect
affinities with Elgar's funeral march from 'Grania and Diarmid' which began
the concert.
Unsurprisingly, such affinities are hardly to be found in Vaughan Williams'
Serenade to Music, that great celebration of Shakespeare, music and the
cream of Britain's inter-war singing talent. If one can never hope to
recapture the unique, irreplaceable qualities of Sir Henry's original cast
recording, Davis and his chosen 12 were still able to let Vaughan Williams'
luminous music weave its spell, with each little solo beautifully etched yet
subservient to the glowing colours to the whole.
Given the right soloists and a sympathetic conductor, the Vaughan Williams
more or less plays itself. That is probably less true of Beethoven, whose
seventh symphony was selected for the concert's second half. Maybe in his
choice of ultra brisk tempi, Davis was aiming for some of the fiery
brilliance with which the infirm Sir Henry, at the last concert he ever
conducted, was reported to have imbued the work. Davis turned the symphony
into a remorseless Totentanz, more an apocalypse than the 'apotheosis of the
dance' which Wagner dubbed it. This is one view of the work, I suppose, but
one which robbed it of its internal tensions and releases.
It was an interpretation not enhanced by Davis's unsettling habit of raising
imploring eyes aloft, as if offering up prayers for a safe deliverance.
Luckily, one duly occured: Sir Henry's grandiloquent orchestration of
Rachmaninov's C sharp minor Prelude, complete with organ and five
percussionists, a bizarre exercise perhaps, but further testimony to the
versatility of a man whose vision and practicality we all have much to be
grateful for.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Arts: The remarkable Mark Morris - Clement Crisp on the
American choreographer's L'Allegro at the Festival Theatre, Edinburgh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is one of the most encouraging and most imaginative things about the
Edinburgh Festival that it should have established a special relationship
with Mark Morris. This year brings his third consecutive appearance at the
Festival. And this year Lothian Regional Council and the Foundation for
Sports and the Arts have initiated an educational project (funded by
ScottishPower) which will provide classroom sessions and further involvement
with the Morris company to children and older students.
There is talk of another Morris visit next year. Such patronage and Festival
support argues a sense of responsibility and respect for a major artist -
and his public - which can bring wonderful rewards.
Morris' offering this year is that luminous L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il
Moderato which he staged as his first offering when he took up residence in
Brussels in 1988. Morris was not the man for the Brussels public, hankering
after that other Maurice (Bejart) who had been their dance-guru for a
quarter of a century, but the Monnaie opera house, where he was installed as
Bejart's successor, provided a fine stage and tremendous musical forces.
Morris seized the moment. His affection for - and wonderfully imaginative
response to - baroque music could be properly satisfied with the means he
had gained. So he chose to realise L'Allegro ed il Penseroso, Handel's
setting of Milton (in the admittedly somewhat compromised version made by
Charles Jennens, whose advocacy of moderation provides some earnest but
blessedly brief versifying for il Moderato).
The resultant piece, given in December 1988, was a joy, and I reported on it
with great pleasure. Here was a choreographer, already remarkable for his
ability to clothe music with sensitive movement, at full stretch, grandly
responsive to an important score. Now L'Allegro has been brought to
Edinburgh, in two performances at the Festival Theatre at the weekend, with
the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, the Edinburgh Schola Cantorum, and soloists
under Gareth Jones - and it looked splendid indeed. The Brussels' designs
have been retained. Adrianne Lobel's succession of gauzes turn the stage
into a magical arena where blocks of pure colour are both dramatic and
allusive. James Ingalls' lighting is a marvel in illuminating the dance
while still creating atmosphere. Christine van Loon's clothes are simple,
always apt, lightly flowing.
An uncompromised clarity is the most obvious quality of Morris' dances for
his cast of 12 men and 12 women. The effect comes from his decision that
words should find immediate theatrical life in gesture and movement, that as
a voice sings 'ivy-crowned' dancers will briefly sketch a crown on their
heads, that 'Jest and youthful Jollity' should mean just that in steps and
capers. Morris is looking back to those 'music visualisations' which were
part of the first naive strivings of American Modern Dance, but his manner
places such genuine innocence within a vastly sophisticated context.
At his most powerful and most searching, the images open out on to the
European pastoral tradition, and to much older ideals about dance. His
hunting scene, inspired by 'To listen how the hounds and horn/Cheerly rouse
the slumb'ring morn/From the side of some hoar hill', reaches back to
Renaissance festivities, as dancers impersonate trees, hill, hounds, quarry.
The closing ring dances evoke those theological ideals of celestial harmony
which occupied the Fathers of the church. Morris' choreography renews the
past for us with a radiant assurance: it is effortlessly both then and now.
In everything Morris respects words as well as score. Clear textures,
quickly passing imagery, a certain modesty of means - no bravura; no
rodomontade - are the keynotes to the work. The swathes of group dances
which bring the piece to its close - chains, rings, long lines of simplest
movement - are powerful evidence of his command of effects. Here we see him,
in Milton's words, 'Untwisting all the chains that tie/The hidden soul of
harmony'. Morris clothes the hidden in beautifully visible dance. Harmony
reigns.
The musical performance under Gareth Jones was stylish. The singers were
pleasing - though in a work where every word counts so that we may savour
what Morris does with it, I wish that diction had been uniformly exact. The
Morris company dancers were dedicated, and very fine.

<TEXT>
Amid all the coverage of the Commonwealth Games (7.00 and 10.10 on BBC1,
8.30 on BBC2) BBC2 ends its current series of On The Line with a programme
about drugs in sport. The present system seems ludicrously haphazard and
inefficient, with some people penalised for taking cold cures or drinking
coffee while wholesale blood-changers go unchallenged. The trouble is today
that it is not just the pride of athletes that is at stake but huge
investments from advertisers ((8.00). No one would claim that the BBC1
series All Night Long, with its collection of misfits working In a bakery,
was a classic comedy. But after the final episode today in the opening
series it may well be re-commissioned on the grounds that it is better than
most of the other comedies around (8.30). Vitali Vitaliev who left the
Soviet Union five years ago, before the fall of the Berlin Wall, takes a
video camera and retraces his steps for the series Travels With My Camera
(9.00 C4). Radio 4's new Book At Bedtime is Herodotus, read by John Tusa - a
wonderful idea (10.45).

FT  22 AUG 94 / Arts: Young stars out on an Edinburgh night - Richard
Fairman assesses the European Community Youth Orchestra
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the arrival of the European Community Youth Orchestra the platform at
the Usher Hall was a blaze of colour. The twelve flags of the member
countries were on display and regulation attire for the ladies of the
orchestra was bright blue dresses and stoles decorated with European stars,
as though each had been wrapped in the Union flag before coming on.
What a lot of blue there was, too. About three-quarters of the ECYO's
present membership are women, the heavy brass and double-bass sections
seeming to be the only remaining bastions of male domination. No doubt the
administration wants as many youngsters as possible to have a chance of
taking part and the size of the orchestra is huge, including so many string
players that there was barely room for them on the stage.
The orchestra's summer tour is split into two parts: smaller venues are
getting a Bartok and Mahler programme under James Judd (the ECYO's Artistic
Director), while major festivals such as Salzburg and the Proms warrant
Carlo Maria Giulini, who is conducting Brahms symphonies. For Giulini, a
visit to the Edinburgh Festival must seem a sentimental affair, as this was
the scene of his British debut back in 1955.
Forty years on, his conducting style has become more notable for its gravity
of expression than any youthful spontaneity. With the massive army of
strings at his disposal, these were always going to be weighty performances
anyway. It would be rash to claim that the ECYO is up to professional
standards (student bands rarely manage to produce a sophisticated quality of
sound and there were some raw noises here) but it manages an impressive
unanimity of ensemble, given the numbers involved.
Indeed, there are major orchestras which might be less responsive to
Giulini's indulgent phrasing of the Second Symphony. His Brahms now goes
very slowly and the richly lyrical playing that he likes is not enough to
make up for a debilitating lack of momentum. In the Fourth Symphony, there
was some good solo playing to hold the attention - first flute and clarinet
both wanting to make real music - and Giulini's muscular rhythms also
generated more tension. The end of the symphony was awesome and powerful.
After Edinburgh and a Saturday night appearance at the Proms, the ECYO is
heading off to Germany and the Netherlands. Presumably the young musicians
of four other countries will soon be hoping to join, which will mean still
higher standards and even more stars on the designer evening wear.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Media Futures: A Newbie's guide to Internet lingo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The most mild mannered person can become reckless and aggressive behind the
steering wheel of a car. Computer keyboards, it seems, often have a similar
effect. People who would not dream of using epithets in casual conversation,
swear outrageously when exchanging electronic messages.
For novice drivers on the information highway, this can come as quite a
shock. A naive question, calling for advice, is likely to receive a sharp
response such as 'RTFM' (read the **** manual) or , if you are lucky, 'Read
the FAQs' (frequently asked questions) from a more experienced traveller who
is not happy to be stuck behind a 'Net Newbie' (a learner driver). The Net
might be the new open space of global communications but its actually
structured by a highly developed etiquette and snobbery.
To avoid confrontations, keep a smile on your face. This can be achieved
quite simply by typing :-) at the end of your messages. Turned on its side,
this looks like a pair of eyes, nose and a smiling mouth.
Over the years, 'smileys' as they are called on the Internet, have becoming
increasingly elaborate. There is ;-) for winking and :-) a smiley with
mustache. :-x means 'my lips are sealed' and =:-) is a punk rocker.
If you are feeling :-( and lonely, the Internet is a great place to meet
MOTOS (members of the opposite sex) or MOTAS (members of the appropriate
sex). Get too personal, however, and you may be told LJBF (lets just be
friends), or CU (see you).
Since the Internet is a place where everybody has an opinion, there are
shortcuts to expressing them. IMHO is perhaps the commonest net acronym,
meaning 'in my humble opinion'. It is generally used in a far from humble
manner.
BTW (by the way) you should never send a message on the Usenet (user
network) that you don't want thousands of people to read IMHO. It is in the
PD (public domain) and YOYW (you own your words).
If you want to make an impression on the Net, don't spend Dollars (money) on
designer jeans, just make up your own acronym and use it as if everyone else
ought to know what it means. As an example TOD (the other day) will do quite
adequately. If you do not know what you are talking about, do not be
dissuaded from corresponding with thousands of other Net users. There are
three marvellous words that can be substituted for any word: foo, bar and
foobar are used as generics, as in 'The foobar Times, what's it called
again?'
An important rule is always to have some comment to make. It is called the
Ob- , such as the Objoke, the obligatory joke. This is not to be confused
with the OS, the computer operating system, which is far from funny and can
easily become the subject of a lengthy and highly technical 'Net exchange.
Getting 'flamed' is a rite of passage on the 'info highway' ' a term that is
BYW (by the way) de rigueur among REAL Netters. It is not too difficult to
incite such personal attacks.
A sure way to set the Net afire is to send messages suggesting that it is
populated by people who can't spell and whose grammar is poor. This , of
course, is true - but it is not a nice thing to point out IMHO.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Media Futures: Electronic poser for copyright laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Internet devotees will get a gleam in their eye as they extol the joys of
'surfing the net' - the practice of wandering through the millions of data
bases, files and message groups proliferating on this self-regulating global
web of computer networks and electronic mail systems.
Travellers in this virtual world will tell you that almost anything is
available on the Internet. Sitting at their desks hacking away at their
keyboards, they can access recipes, copies of national legislation or, if
they're lucky, soul mates.
Lately, some Internet users have been able to find copies of word-processing
programs or computer games. Some software is put on the system as
'freeware', information that is in the public domain.
However, copies of commercial software are also available, without their
high street price tags. For less than the cost of an international phone
call, users are able to log on and download programs from the Internet on to
their own computers.
Software authors, the companies that sell the programs and governments view
the growing practice of exchanging copyrighted software via the Internet as
computer piracy.
In a case now before the courts in the US, the US Attorney's office in
Boston, Massachusetts has indicted David LaMacchia, a student at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for conspiring to make an estimated
Dollars 1m in copyrighted business and entertainment computer software
available on the Internet.
Between November 1993 and January 1994, LaMacchia, who is charged with
criminal wire fraud, is said to have operated a bulletin board service out
of MIT computer work stations. He is alleged to have invited users around
the world to post commercial software on to the bulletin board for exchange
with other users.
The case, which is up for further pleadings at the end of this month,
exposes the difficulty of prosecuting crimes under copyright infringement
and fraud laws which were not set up to deal with developments in electronic
communication.
LaMacchia is protesting his innocence on the grounds that he did not
personally copy any software on to the Internet bulletin board but merely
operated the system in which others made copies.
'He is no more liable for what people do on the system than somebody who
runs a telephone network is liable for what people say on the telephone,'
said Harvey Silverglate, a Boston attorney representing LaMacchia.
Catching those who actually copied software from LaMacchia's bulletin board
could be almost impossible. 'You may not know who the people who are copying
the material are, or where they are from,' said Mark Sherwood-Edwards, a
solicitor at Simon Olswang in London. 'It would be difficult to say where
the copyright infringement took place. Right now the laws are jurisdictional
but the Internet is global.'
LaMacchia's lawyers believe the case should be dismissed because to try him
would entail 'stretching and mangling' US law. They claim LaMacchia's
alleged activities on the Internet are not covered by the criminal statutes
for copyright infringement or wire fraud.
Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe, a specialist in US
constitutional law and the legal ramifications of technology, said
inadequacy of current laws to deal with copyright infringement on the
Internet did not 'in principle create rights to free software'.
On the other hand, he said LaMacchia's case was being manipulated to fit
existing statutes. 'It seems like they are trying to fit a square into a
round hole,' he said. 'I think the situation calls for action at the
legislative level, rather than on a case by case trial.'
Software companies, however, believe they can cut down on Internet piracy by
going after individual cases. 'Last week we took down an Internet bulletin
board where our software was being copied,' said Harrison Colter, a lawyer
for Novell, a software manufacturer which recently merged with Wordperfect.
The companies know that such policing will not get rid of software piracy
altogether. 'No one is naive enough to believe that copyright infringement
can be eradicated from the Internet,' said Ed Morin, head of Novell's
anti-piracy team. 'But we will aggressively go after pirates, and if they
think they can get away with it they need to know what the penalties can be.
It could be jail time or heavy civil fines.'

with the company to take up a position in his family business, writes Louise
Lucas.
Cheng, who led the conglomerate's efforts to secure a publicly-declared
long-term debt-rating back in March - making Wharf the first Hong Kong
conglomerate to attain such a rating - was responsible for group finance and
corporate affairs, as well as the group's hotels business.
His finance duties will be picked up by Quinn Law, a non-executive director

FT  22 AUG 94 / People (Names in the News): Cargill looks outside family
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ernest Micek, the new president of Cargill, is neither family nor a trader,
two deficits that in another time might have kept him from being next in
line for the chairman's office, writes Laurie Morse.
Cargill, the secretive commodity merchandiser whose tentacles reach into
remote corners of the globe, was built on the canny skills of its traders,
who long have been the masters of the company's universe.
However, with flat global trade in bulk commodities, Micek's appointment is
viewed as a shift toward the company's higher-margin commodities processing
arm and its future in food marketing. Micek, 58, has spent his 35-year
career building Cargill's food processing operations, including its highly
profitable corn-milling division, which makes sweetners for soft drinks and
is expanding into the ethanol business.
Last year, the company had profits of Dollars 348m on Dollars 47bn in sales.
Micek's appointment as president puts him in a logical position to succeed
Whitney MacMillan, the 64-year-old great-grandson of one of the company's
founders who has served as chairman for 17 years.
MacMillan plans to retire next year, and with few family members waiting in
the top executive ranks, a lifetime Cargill executive with upper mid-West
roots may prove to be the best substitute.
Another contender is David Raisbeck, the 44-year-old head of Cargill's
trading sector, who was given a seat on the board when Micek was made
president this month.

FT  22 AUG 94 / People (Names in the News): John Palmer: weighing up
competition and protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No one will have more questions to answer about the collapse of Canada's
Confederation Life than John Palmer, writes Bernard Simon. Although he has
been nowhere near the insurance industry in recent years, Palmer was named
Ottawa's superintendent of financial institutions less than 24 hours after
the regulator seized control of the beleaguered insurance group on August
11.
Palmer, aged 50, is currently senior partner in the Toronto office of
auditors KPMG Peat Marwick Thorne. He has overseen audits at some of
Canada's big banks and trust companies, but his main job over the past year
has been to reorganise the firm's public-sector practice.
One former Peat Marwick colleague describes him as 'very energetic, and very
concerned to do the right thing. He's a little bit on the introverted side,
but not badly so'. Despite his limited experience in financial services,
Palmer ascribes his appointment to his management experience, a 'good
working knowledge' of the financial industry and a 'good reputation' in the
financial community. His predecessor was also plucked from the auditing
profession.
One of the main issues in the Confed debacle is whether the superintendent's
office acted firmly or early enough to prevent Canada's fourth-biggest
insurer from sinking under the weight of sour property loans.
Palmer describes regulatory intervention as an elusive question: 'How do you
intervene early enough to protect policy-holders and depositors, but still
maintain a competitive industry?' he asks.
Confed's failure comes on the heels of the virtual annihilation of Canada's
trust industry, which was also dragged down largely by ill-advised forays
into risky commercial property. These events are bound to increase pressure
for tighter supervision of financial institutions.
Palmer indicates however, that he will take 'a balanced approach'.
Over-regulation, he says, could starve financial institutions of outside
capital. 'I'm not panicking about the insurance industry. Everything I've
seen suggests that the Confederation situation was quite isolated.'
Such caution suggests that the new superintendent will avoid radical
changes. 'I have some prejudices, but they're largely based on anecdotal
evidence,' Palmer says. His first job, he insists, will be to expand his
knowledge of the industry by talking to the main players.

FT  22 AUG 94 / People: At the democratic heart of the new Germany - Sir
Norman Foster, the British architect picked to redesign Berlin's Reichstag,
tells Judy Dempsey he has a sense of wonder about the city
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Berliners have an opinion on everything. They also like to complain. Ask
them what they think about the Reichstag becoming the new seat of the German
government when parliamentarians eventually move to Berlin in the late 1990s
and they will opine about the cost, estimated at around DM15bn. Then they
will question how democratically elected deputies dare reconvene at a place
indelibly associated with some of the darkest periods of Germany's past.
In spite of the controversy, Sir Norman Foster, the British architect who
won the competition to redesign the building, still retains a sense of
humour as well as a sense of wonder about the city.
'If you look at what has happened in Berlin since unification (in 1990), it
is miraculous. It is faster and more precipitous than anyone's wildest
dreams. It's a bit like watching Nigel Mansell with his foot on the floor
going around the Grand Prix circuit and asking why can't he go faster.'
It is not difficult to see what Sir Norman means. Berlin resembles a giant
building site; new buildings emerge from the rubble, and new rail,
underground and bus networks link the former divided city. Public attention
is focused on the Reichstag and, in designing the building, Sir Norman is
designing the democratic heart of the new Germany.
The Mancunian architect has an impressive track record for taking on the
task; he was the designer of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank building in Hong
Kong, the acclaimed Stansted airport in Britain, and the Commerzbank
headquarters in Frankfurt. Yet he never thought a British architect would be
awarded the job of redesigning the German parliament.
Sir Norman, sitting in a bright, vast office with high ceilings a hundred
yards from the Reichstag, said he believed it was 'inconceivable that
someone could seriously consider giving the responsibility for a new German
parliament to British architects. It seemed such a long shot.'
But with a bit of persuading from his wife, he visited Berlin to reconsider.
He listened to parliamentarians and planners. He found out what was
important to them. 'My doubts were shaken. I was soon fired with enthusiasm.
It must be one of the most important projects in the world today. And I
think we were inspired by that.'
Sir Norman set to work with his team of 81 architects and a budget of
DM600m. The central philosophical thread running through the project over
the past two years - and two completely different designs - was the need to
make the Reichstag accessible and democratic.
Yet the primary influence upon his design was the symbolism and historical
significance of the Reichstag.
'The history of the Reichstag has so many interpretations. It was about the
birth of Nazism but in many ways it was also about the death of it. It
contains so many layers of history. It has also been the scene of
extraordinary celebration and optimism.'
The democratic defenders of the Reichstag, which was designed in Italian
Renaissance style by Paul Wallot and completed after a decade's building in
1894, rarely had a chance to use it as a forum for free debate.
Bismarck, who never crossed the threshold, loathed it, preferring the
deputies to continue meeting in the old state porcelain factory. Hermann
Goring and Josef Goebbels arranged to have it burned in 1933. The Allies
bombed it in late 1943. The interior of the burnt-out shell was finally
restored in east German communist style between 1969 and 1971. Bequeathed to
Sir Norman was an abestos-infested edifice whose internal structure bears no
resemblance to the original designs.
Despite this troubled history, Sir Norman says his proposals for the
Reichstag owe a great deal to the original generosity of the space.
He will rebuild the facades around the courtyard, introduce natural light
through an elegant light house capped by a dome, and modernise Wallot's
natural ventilation system.
'What we are doing involves a very delicate intervention with the past. It
is about bringing back the qualities of the old earlier spaces and in the
process creating some dynamic new ones. It is very much about dealing with
the historic fabric, rediscovering the building, the quality of the
materials, and the craftsmanship. In that sense, we are traditionalists.'
Yet the emphasis on accountability and openness that united Germany's new
parliament must have is never far from his mind. 'The whole scheme begins by
placing everyone on the single democratic level - the historic first floor
(the original location of the debating chamber) where government is seen to
be open and accessible,' he explains.
Sir Norman wants the building to be accessible to the public in another way
as well. The public should have the benefit 'of one of the best viewing
platforms in Berlin. When you get on the roof of the Reichstag you have a
breathtaking view of the city. It is an incredible vista. And aside from
just the sensual satisfaction of surveying the scenery, symbolically to be
able to wander freely and have a meal up there, to ascend a viewing platform
which is metaphorically and physically above the debating chamber, above the
politicians, is indeed powerful stuff. And to mix freely with politicans and
to enter the front door, through the grand staircase is to rediscover the
historical roots of the building.'
Yet Sir Norman admits that an 'equal amount of energy has gone into
security. You cannot get into the same lift as the politicians when moving
to different levels of the building. No chance] But the security is not
advertised by iron bars and spikes. It is very discreet.'
The debate about when, and at what cost, the government will finally move to
the German capital has been far from discreet. Sir Norman and his staff seem
non-plussed by the debate. Doubtless, Berliners would complain if the
timetable were to be postponed. But they might also even grow to like and
respect the Reichstag.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Singapore unveiled its high-tech 'court of the future' last Friday and a
judge said the use of computers and video conferencing could halve the time
it takes to hear a case.
The scheme could also save taxpayers money and child witnesses the trauma of
appearing in open court.
The Subordinate Courts unveiled the project, known as Court Vision 21.
A district judge presided over a mock trial which used dial-up
video-conferencing, voice-recognition transcription systems, pen-based
computing and other multimedia applications.
'The legal aspects will have to be looked into,' said district judge Adrian
Soon. For instance, delivery of testimony via video is not now admissible.
However, he believed courts of the future could hear twice as many cases a
day if fully automated.
Wee Teck Hin, head of information systems at the Singapore National Computer
Board, said the demonstration aimed to satisfy the three main objectives of
the court of the future: paperless systems, instant transcription of
evidence and the giving of testimony by video transmission.
The trial used 'litigation support software', allowing evidence and exhibits
produced in court to be called up almost instantaneously on the judge's
personal computer in his chambers.
Another piece of software, 'SING' (Sentencing Information Guide System),
allows instant storage and retrieval of documents in text, video, image and
voice.
The project is being conducted by the Subordinate Courts, the computer board
and several suppliers.
NEC Corp., the Japanese computer group which holds more than 50 per cent of
the country's personal computer market, said last Friday that it plans to
market in Japan a video-on-demand system, in which users can call up videos
through their computers.
The system, to be available early next year, will employ technology acquired
from Starlight Network Inc., a small US software concern based in
California.
Even with modifications by NEC, the Starlight Network technology enables
video transmission to only 200 users, so NEC plans to target business
customers to start.
In video-on-demand, users can call up, via their computer terminals, any
video that is offered by the system. Branch offices of a company, for
example, could gain immediate access to a company news video produced at
headquarters.
In the future, the technology could enable people to watch the latest video
release at home without having to go out to their local video hire store.
NEC also said it believed the system would generate demand as a teaching aid
in schools.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Sport: Mavericks as heroes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week I got lucky on a horse called Ezzoud, 4-1 winner of the Juddmonte
International Stakes at York. A gamble is always a gamble, but a gamble on
Ezzoud is really a gamble: he is always capable of winning but he does not,
it seems, always want to do so. Betting on him, I was hoping not merely that
he would overcome the other horses, but also that he would overcome himself,
his own wayward temperament.
Ezzoud had a handsome victory in the Coral Eclipse Stakes at Sandown last
month, storming disdainfully past Derby and St Leger winners. Very soon
afterwards, when strongly fancied in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth
Diamond Stakes at Ascot, he threw his jockey - poor helpless Walter Swinburn
 -within about a second of the off. Throughout the whole of the race one
glimpsed his blinkered face in its executioners hood, glinting demoniacally
amid the other horses as he refused to do the decent thing and get out of
everyone's way.
I have backed a horse whose chances Ezzoud almost certainly scuppered.
Nonetheless my overriding feeling was one of admiration for this
free-thinking creature, who was running exactly the race that he wanted. It
was a travesty, but it was magnificent. And it heightened immeasurably the
pleasure that I felt when Ezzoud - this time carrying my money on his back -
ran with such will and majesty at York last Tuesday. If a gamble on Ezzoud
is a double gamble, then when it comes up it brings double the satisfaction.
He is his own man, or horse: abundant with talent, miserly in its
deployment: hugely frustrating, proportionately rewarding. His slit-eyed
mask amid all those noble brows looks like a badge of disgrace, as indeed in
a way it is. When it comes off his eye gleam wildly, faintly contemptuous
and not a little sadistic: he knows that he has his followers horribly
hooked. I love him. His heart is not always in the right place - quite often
he keeps his brain there instead - but he is mesmerising and surprising,
and, when he wants to be, almost great.
Above all, he is remarkable for his independent spirit. This is a rare
characteristic in sport: sports personalities may proclaim their autonomy,
but, like most of us, they are circumscribed by innumerable unnecessary
fears. They worry about their image, which means they worry about the press.
They worry about competition, which means they worry about the abilities of
others at least as much about their own. I admit that a horse is not in a
position to entertain anxieties of this kind. But Ezzoud's is an example of
the kind of attitude which, when translated into human terms, signifies
freedom from dull, pointless and miserable fear.
Cyclist Graeme Obree, for instance, is his own man. I love him too. On the
recent BBC 1 programme The Contenders, in which sportsmen vied with one
another in telling the camera who among them trained the hardest, he made
them all look faintly foolish with his pronouncement, made from deep within
an armchair, that he only went out on his bike when he felt like it.
Of course the authorities mistrust him, as they do all free-thinkers. Last
week, they banned him from defending his 4,000m pursuit title in the
capital's World Track Championships in Sicily: apparently when he rode his
chest was too close to his arms. Or was it that the bike which he had built
for himself - an achievement deserving stunned praise, not curmudgeonly
censure - had handlebars made from stags antlers, or wheels made from LP
records, or just looked peculiar dammit? The authorities are trying to crush
Graeme's independent spirit, but they won't do it. I have faith in him, as I
have in Ezzoud: both can always win because both always know they can.
This is the thing about free-spirits. They can be cavalier with their
ability because they are so sure of it. Of course there are great talents
who are not free-spirits and free-spirits who are not great talents. But
best of all are those that are both: those in whom supreme ability mingles
with the truly unimpeded flow of personality
Golfer Laura Davies, for instance, is her own woman. I love her too.
Feminists desperately seeking a role model should look no further than
Laura: she shows all those poor uptight women, frantically juggling old and
new definitions of feminity, for the anxious sheep that many of them are.
She does what she wants. She plays golf better than every woman, and almost
every man, in the world. When she wins she celebrates in her own style,
enjoying her money, gambling shamelessly. She knows as much about sport as
any man, and gives her answers on 'Question of Sport' with none of the usual
'I'm proving a point for women' coyness. She conforms to no received ideals
of beauty, and paradoxically this makes her rather attractive. Anyway, why
should she care about nonsense like dieting, when her thighs enabled her to
power a ball upwards of 300 yards?
Of course those who do not relish free-spirits are worried by her, just as
they are worried by Ezzoud's rolling eye and Obree's mechano set bicycle.
Why doesn't she want to be like everybody else. They wonder in agony.
Because, she like that wicked horse and that lazy cyclist, has the gift of
being herself. Laura Davies; Graeme Obree; Ezzoud: my three sporting heroes.

FT  22 AUG 94 / This Week: The FT Guide to the Rail Strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How did the dispute begin?
The RMT transport union made a claim in January 1993 for an interim 11 per
cent payment for signal staff, to cover past productivity improvements and
restore differentials with other rail workers. It re-submitted the claim in
February.
The signalling workers grievances go back to 1987 when they raised the issue
of productivity payments linked to automation. The RMT told first British
Rail and then Railtrack, the state-owned company which since privatisation
in April has run the rail network, that once agreement was reached on the
interim claim it would discuss restructuring working practices.
The union's claim was rejected. In April signalling staff voted 4-1 on an 80
per cent turnout for strikes over the claim.
Why did the ballot not lead to a negotiated settlement?
Between June 6 and June 8 the RMT and Railtrack held what the union calls
'intensive negotiations' and the company 'exploratory discussions'. The
union claims it was offered verbally a 5.7 per cent pay increase in return
for productivity and lost differentials. However, on June 9, after the
management met the Department of Transport, government ministers said the
proposed offer breached the public sector pay policy. On Monday June 13 RMT
negotiators walked out on Railtrack, claiming the company had withdrawn its
offer.
How have the strikes proceeded?
The first 24-hour strike was on Wednesday June 15. They continued each
Wednesday until the week beginning July 24, when a 48-hour stoppage was
called. The worst period of disruption was on August 12, 15 and 16. When the
strikes started very few trains ran. But Railtrack has mobilised supervisors
and managers to man signal boxes. By the end of last month about 30 per cent
of services were running. Today Railtrack hopes that 40 per cent will be
operating.
What are signalling workers paid?
Signal workers' basic rates are between Pounds 146 and Pounds 235.75 per
week. Allowances, shift premia and overtime payments averaging 11 hours on a
39-hour normal week, increase average gross earnings to Pounds 320 a week,
an average hourly rate of Pounds 6.51. This compares with Pounds 6.85 for
all BR staff and Pounds 9.01 for London Underground workers.
What do signalling workers do?
Most signal workers operate highly computerised equipment, covering large
areas of the rail network. The RMT argues the increased responsibilities
have not produced higher earnings under the old job classification system.
What is Railtrack offering the signalling workers?
The definitive offer to the RMT was made on June 27 at the conciliation
service ACAS. The company proposed a three-part package which would have
produced a payment of over 3 per cent in earnings, on top of a 2.5 per cent
annual pay increase. The package involved an extra 6 per cent supplement on
basic rates from July 1, not to be used in calculations for shift or premium
allowances, a one-off lump sum of Pounds 200 for everybody accepting
cashless pay (this was later raised to Pounds 250) and the promise of a
restructuring productivity deal to be negotiated by October 1.
Railtrack said the full package would increase most earnings by 10 per cent.
It conceded the earnings of up to a quarter of staff would be cut by the
integration of allowances into basic pay.
In return for the pay increases the signalling workers would have to accept
sweeping changes in their working practices, some of which date back to just
after the First World War. The reforms would involve acceptance of
compulsory Sunday working, longer shifts as well as the introduction of job
evaluation and more flexibility.
What are the prospects of an agreement?
Still not good. Despite 11 weeks of argument, the union insists signal staff
must receive an interim payment of between 5.7 per cent and 11 per cent
before it will discuss a restructuring package. On August 9 it said a
settlement was possible if Railtrack would offer a 4.6 per cent pay rise
plus either a one hour cut in the basic working week, improvements in shift
and overtime payments or an improvement in an index linked payment. In
return for this the RMT said it would enter five days of talks on
restructuring and put the results to a ballot.
Railtrack said the proposals were unacceptable because they would involve an
increase in a payment workers were not entitled to and no promise that it
would result in a deal by October 1 - the company's deadline if the workers
pension arrangements are to be safeguarded.
What options are there to end the strike?
Railtrack is planning, if necessary, to encourage signalling workers
individually to accept its final restructuring package. Yet it remain's
hesitant about such a move for fear of being rebuffed by the workers. It has
virtually ruled out the more draconian idea of dismissing workers who refuse
to accept new terms of conditions and employment. It does not have an
alternative, trained workforce that could replace existing signal workers.
In the highly unionised railway industry, such a step would antagonise other
groups of workers.
The alternative is to open up more of the rail network during each strike
through a more effective use of managers and supervisors, supplemented by
signalling staff who are drifting back to work. If Railtrack can run more
than 40 per cent of services in defiance of the strike, the union will be
under severe pressure to return to the negotiating table.

Qualifying Round, Second Leg.
Glasgow Rangers spent heavily on players again this summer. But their
expensive team was outplayed in the first leg in Athens and lost 2-0. They
must reach the second round, with its lucrative round-robin playoff system,
to profit fully on the investment. Worse, another early exit could
jeopardise Scotland's European Cup place and doom Rangers, even if they win
the league yet again, to a UEFA cup place next season.
Motor racing
Sunday, August 28, Formula 1, Belgian Grand Prix, Spa Francorchamps.
The Formula 1 season stages another roaring instalment of on-course tedium
and off-course melodrama. All the cockpit cameras, pit-lane cameras and
helicopter cameras, lovingly replaying every explosion and every crash,
cannot disguise the predictability of the racing: Berger following Hill
following Schumacher round one track after another. The only question that
remains is whether the authorities can suspend Schumacher before he amasses
an insurmountable championship lead.

<TEXT>
Kurt Cobain's suicide note - 'It's better to burn out than to fade away' was
a quotation from Neil Young's bracing Rust Never Sleeps album, an unhappy
citation which seems to have unsettled the grizzly veteran; Sleeps with
Angels (Reprise) is his most troubled and intense album for more than a
decade, as far from the comforting homilies of his former partners in
harmony as you can get. The album's stand-out track, 'Change Your Mind', is
a return to his very best form.
Prince makes another stab at the Madonna Award for Sexual Subtlety with his
disappointing Come (Warner Brothers). Plenty of bumping and grunting fails
to compensate for a distinct shortage of ideas, while even the musical
groove is sounding a little dated. Best to switch off after 'Orgasm' and
settle down with the lattest in a bewildering series of 'theme'
compilations, Classic Sleepies (Teldec), a motley collection of adagios and
serenades. If you hear the final track you have wasted your money, in theory
you should have fallen asleep by then.
After giving highly-acclaimed performances of Handel's Messiah all over
France for the past three years, William Christie and Les Arts Florissants
have finally committed the work to disc (harmonia mundi) with fine results.
Andreas Scholl's clear, pure alto stands out among an excellent young cast
of singers which includes Barbara Schlick and Mark Padmore.
Treasures from the past continue to be unearthed, digitally re-mastered and
released for a public which seems to have an infinite thirst to listen and
compare; recommended by no less than Wilhelm Furtwangler, Dimitri
Mitropoulos made his own considerable impact on the Salzburg Festival when
he took over the great man's Don Giovanni in the summer of 1956. The live
recording of that performance, re-mastered directly from Austrian Radio
tapes, is issued for the first time by Sony, and features the young Cesare
Siepi, Elisabeth Grummer and Lisa della Casa, ably backed by the Vienna
Philarmonic.
At budget price, in celebration of the 100th anniversary of the birth of
Karl Bohm, is the conductor's 1967 Bayreuth Festival recording of the
complete Ring cycle (Philips)on 14 cds, featuring Birgit Nilsson, Wolfgang
Windgassen, Theo Adam and James King.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vitali Vitaliev, Russia's answer to Clive James, returns to the Ukraine five
years after he defected in Travels With My Camera (Monday, 9.00-10.00, C4),
a series that aims to do away with the paraphernalia of programme-making by
arming the presenter with a Hi-8 camera to get an immediacy absent from
other programmes. But Vitaliev's technological illiteracy made this
difficult - he jokes that the documentary should be renamed 'Troubles With
My Camera'. In the five years he has been away the economy has been turned
upside down. Hyperinflation means an apple costs a pensioner a quarter of
her monthly income, a shortage of small change means that phone boxes are
free and the most powerful people are gangster-like 'businessmen'.
At the other end of the Asian land mass there are daily rumours that Deng
Xiao Ping, China's nonagenerian leader is dead. To mark his birthday on
Monday the BBC has produced a profile The People's Dictator (Tuesday,
9.30-10.20, BBC2). In the last few months, Deng has disappeared from public
view but his presence still looms large. Reporter Julian O'Halloran, who
covered the Tianamen Square demonstrations, gives an absorbing account of
how Deng has kept a grip on the greasy pole since 1916 by being a supremely
pragmatic politician who even managed to reinstate himself after being
denounced during the Cultural Revolution. But he is no diplomat - his
remarks to Mrs Thatcher are said to have been so rude that the interpreter
thought it best not to translate them. And he's certainly not a democrat -
China is still waiting for the political reforms that were promised
alongside economic liberalisation. The vital question is what will happen
after Deng dies - one that the documentary, unfortunately, ducks.
The early years of TV were dominated by showman entrepreneurs - literally so
in the case of Lew (now Lord) Grade whose first claim to fame was as a
champion Charleston dancer. The BBC is paying tribute to the last of the
old-style media moghuls with a season of programmes starting with ATV Night
(Saturday, 7.55-12.05am) which will be introduced from the foyer of the
Crossroads Motel, famous as the setting for Lord Grade's most successful
early evening soap opera.
Alas Meg Richardson (Noele Gordon) who played the all-controlling
matriarch-cum-motel owner has checked into the celestial chalet now. But her
screen daughter, Jill Richardson (Jane Rossington), will step into the
breach. The line-up includes compilation programmes and episodes from Edward
VII, Danger Man and The Muppet Show. But the centrepiece of the evening is
The Persuader (9.00-9.50) in which Lord Grade is interviewed by his nephew
Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel Four.
Although Lord Grade doesn't quite give us the gen on the reasons for his
departure from ITV, following a boardroom battle with Robert Holmes a Court,
he is generous with the anecdotes which include some gems. If you only watch
one programme this week, watch this.

FT  22 AUG 94 / This Week: The Mask - Film / Video
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Put Arnold Schwarzenegger in True Lies on hold. Resist The Flintstones, if
you have resisted thus far. The best summer holiday treat is The Mask. This
special-effects comedy scores in all departments. Its star is special - the
rubber-faced, high-speed comedian Jim Carrey. Its plot and trick photography
are dazzlingly effective: a young bank clerk's new found power to take any
cartoonish shape he wants, from slavering Disneyish wolf to 3D eye-poppings,
jaw-droppings and heart-leapings. And the comedy is pacy and assured, mixing
high farce, low knockabout and delectable medium-rare impersonations.
If we must have a silly season, this is top-class silliness. Elsewhere, amid
the nuclear Arnolds and neolithic Freds and Barneys, you need to find an
art-house for anything like challenging cinema. Best offbeat pleasure is
America's Go Fish, a tale of lesbian manners light on polemics and strong on
charm and raunchy wit. (Do not take the children or Aunt Edna). Also from
America: the sleekly subversive crime thriller The Last Seduction, with
Linda Fiorentino as a runaway wife, expert at handling stolen cocaine,
sudden sex and swapped identities.
The best homegrown British film - though fast swelling from coterie comedy
to international sell-out - is still Four Weddings and a Funeral. Eight
actors and a phenomenon (Hugh Grant, a sort of matinee-idol Bertie Wooster)
show that the English can still be stylish in laughing at themselves and at
persuading others to do so.
And a video last word, especially for those with children. Disney's Aladdin
is within reach of your VCRs from next week. The songs are jolly, the
colours are resplendent and Robin Williams's motor-mouthed genie is the best
possible warm-up act for Jim Carrey in The Mask.

Britain lost out to Spain last week in what it prides itself on doing best -
making a cup of tea.
Spain's national airline Iberia won the 1994 In-Flight Best Cup of Tea Award
from Britain's National Tea Council, beating British Airways and British
Midland at making the national drink.
'We were absolutely delighted,' said an Iberia spokeswoman. To make the
award a team of tea tasters travelled 672,430 air miles on 239 flights with
30 different airlines. The defeated Britons were characteristically
tight-lipped.

Travellers to Britain today may be caught by the latest in a series of
strikes by rail signal staff.
The strike is part of what has turned into one of the most bitter industrial
disputes since the year long 1984-85 miners' strike. The dispute is over a
pay offer and plans for changes to working practices.
British Rail is running a significant minority of services despite the

Australia's Qantas Airways has unveiled plans for a facelift to improve
services and make it more competitive with other leading Asian carriers
before the company's flotation next year.
Changes include new cabin interiors for the entire Qantas fleet of 120
aircraft, decorated with Australian designs and themes, as well as new staff
uniforms.
Qantas' managing director James Strong described the changes as the biggest
since the airline introduced the jumbo jet to its fleet more than 20 years
ago. Mr Strong said the changes would be introduced over the next year.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Business Travel: Friendly metropolis - Though its crime rate
is high, Sao Paulo is a safe city for foreigners to visit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It may lack the scenic charm of Rio de Janeiro, and suffer from pollution
and a high crime rate, but Sao Paulo is a dynamic and generally friendly
city that is geared towards business.
Paulo The city was largely founded on Brazil's coffee industry in the last
century. Since the 1950s, industrialisation has spread and transformed Sao
Paulo into South America's biggest and most economically powerful
metropolis.
Foreign visitors usually arrive at the city's international airport in
Guarulhos. From there, you can catch one of the half-hourly executive buses
that tour the top hotels in the centre, or go to the reliable cooperativa
taxi stands, where the fare is paid in advance.
Money can be changed at the airport, hotels or bureaux de change, known as
doleiros. The latter usually offer the best rates, but they often do not
accept traveller's cheques.
The approach from the airport to the city centre is unprepossessing. Much of
the route follows the river Tiete, one of the world's most polluted
waterways. As you approach Sao Paulo, the horizon becomes crowded with the
centre's skyscrapers, like a mini Manhattan, but this impressive sight is
diminished by dreary concrete flyovers and roadside shanty towns.
The city's more attractive face is the chic Jardins area, which borders the
modern Avenida Paulista, the main financial and business district. Many of
the luxury hotels, such as the Maksoud Plaza and Mofarrez Sheraton, are in
Jardins. Other upmarket hotels, including the Ca d'Oro and the Hilton, are
nearer the old downtown centro.
A few of the big banks and companies have head offices in the centro, but
many have moved to the Paulista financial district or to suburbs, such as
Santo Amaro in the south. For this reason, as well as the frequent traffic
jams, leave plenty of time to get to appointments.
Do not worry too much about getting lost - it is almost inevitable. Sao
Paulo is a bewildering mass of one-way streets, similar-looking modern
buildings and motorways, with few natural landmarks to help orientation.
However, taxis are plentiful and still relatively cheap. Unlike their
counterparts in Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo taxi drivers are usually safe and
honest. The driver calculates the fare by matching the number on the meter
with a table of prices.
There is also a small but efficient underground system, to be avoided at
rush hours, and a complex bus network, to be avoided at all times.
For business meetings, Paulistanos, as the city's residents are known, are
usually punctual. Exchanging business cards is customary, but executives
tend to be less formal than in other Latin American countries - it is common
to use first names fairly soon.
Bring a light suit, because the city can get very hot. If you arrive in
Brazil's winter, between June and September, you may need thicker clothing,
including pullovers and a coat.
There are few tourist sights in Sao Paulo, but there is a wide variety of
restaurants. With a population of nearly 17m, Sao Paulo is one of the most
multicultural cities in the world, with large communities of Italians, east
Europeans and Arabs, and the largest Japanese settlement outside Japan.
Liberdade, the Japanese neighbourhood, has several good restaurants,
including Sushi-Yassu in Rua Tomas Gonzaga. Rua Treze de Maio in Bixiga, the
Italian district, also has a large number of restaurants and bars. Other
recommended restaurants are Massimo's in Alameda Santos, Jardins; the Ca
d'Oro hotel; and, for north-eastern cuisine, Andrade's in Rua Arturo de
Azevedo, Pinheiros.
Brazil's national dish is the rather heavy feijoada, a meat and black bean
stew originally eaten by slaves. Feijoada is traditionally eaten on
Wednesdays and Saturdays accompanied by a caipirinha, which is cachaca
(sugar cane alcohol) with lime, sugar and crushed ice. Caipirinhas are
delicious but deceptively strong.
For a flavour of the real Sao Paulo, visit a local football match. The city
is home to several excellent teams, including Sao Paulo FC, South American
champions; Palmeiras, Brazilian champions; and Corinthians. There are games
virtually the year round, and tickets can usually be bought at the
turnstiles. Violence is unlikely, but avoid wearing jewellery or expensive
watches.
Sao Paulo has a high crime rate, but this is usually restricted to poorer
districts; business travellers are unlikely to run into difficulties.
However, it is not advisable to walk around the centro late at night - if in
doubt, take a taxi.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Business Travel: Pick of the world's airlines - The factors
that influence passengers' choice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On a scale of one to 10, how would you rate the food on your most recent
flight? What about the seating, the cabin crew and the in-flight
entertainment?
Every year, the Travel Research Centre puts these and other questions to
about 20,000 passengers arriving at London's Gatwick and Heathrow airports.
Based on the replies, Michael Brooks, the head of the centre, has attempted
to formulate a general theory of airline choice. He will be presenting his
findings to an airline conference in London next month.
Brooks says some airlines score well on most of the questions asked, but
remain at the bottom of the list of passengers' preferred carriers. The
reason is that they are not regarded as safe. This might be because of
specific incidents or because their aircraft look old and worn.
Airlines that succeed on the safety test have to pass a second barrier: are
they part of an attractive frequent-flyer programme? If they are, they might
be chosen even if their service is less than adequate.
In the US, however, business travellers participate in so many
frequent-flyer schemes that they do not feel tied to one particular airline.
What matters is how good the airline is.
So which are the good airlines? Brooks says British Airways achieves some of
the highest scores on all routes. Surprisingly, it comes top of hardly any
of the individual categories, such as cabin crew and food. Nevertheless, its
performance in each category is strong enough to make it a market leader
overall.
For south-east Asian carriers, it is not enough to be second best. Their
advertising makes so much of their cabin service that, if this is not top
class, their overall customer satisfaction rating drops.
Brooks says both Malaysian Airlines and Singapore Airlines achieve high
levels of customer satisfaction. Malaysian beats Singapore in the passenger
satisfaction ratings for cabin crew, food and in-flight entertainment.
On North Atlantic routes, Continental of the US scores well, beating Virgin
Atlantic of the UK on all counts except for in-flight entertainment.
Northwest, the US airline, does well on seating and check-in arrangements.
Brooks says, however, that the carrier still has weaknesses, with passengers
finding its cabin crew unenthusiastic.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Management: Hold your breath and take a break
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM PETERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You've heard about the one-minute manager. How about the 30-second vacation?
I'm not kidding. Though no student of Zen Buddhism (my wife, Kate, is), I do
engage in the Zennish practice of 'following my breathing'. It might well be
classified a near-miracle.
Bugged by the direction of a contentious conversation? Trapped in a cab by
slow-moving London traffic and already late for a meeting? Follow your
breathing, for 30 seconds, a moment, or 10 or 20 minutes. By which I mean
tuning into the basic process of breathing; you don't need to intone some
esoteric mantra, just slowly, 'breathing in, two, three, four, breathing
out, two, three, four'.
I know there's more to it and I practise a number of variations. But, in
short, it calls a complete halt to whatever silly, overwrought tension is
building inside me. Doing it on the highway when I'm behind, say, three or
four crawling vehicles, my speed automatically drops by 10 or 20 miles per
hour - and my disposition returns to equilibrium, at times approaching
passivity (no mean feat, for a classic Type A, argumentative personality,
age 51).
Although I've never read a single book on meditation, or taken a formal
lesson, I was prepared by my relative passion for a special form of exercise
 -speedwalking. (Or aerobic walking, powerwalking - all quiet kin of
racewalking; my variety is 11 to 12 minutes per mile.) It started in a hotel
room in Houston, Texas. Going over a telephone-message list from my office
in California, I noted a call from a participant in one of our five-day
seminars. 'You're a walking heart attack in the making,' the healthcare
executive had said. 'Come to one of our facilities: take a stress test, on
me.' (I pictured all sorts of doodads glued to my body, while I raced along
a treadmill - with a physician clucking as he watched my ticker pound out of
control.) I still haven't taken the complimentary test, but the next morning
 -February 11 1989 - I went out for a self-styled 10-minute 'exercise walk'.
I flailed away awkwardly. But I haven't stopped since.
Although no racewalker (solo is my gig - no exceptions), I've become
obsessed. As of this writing, I haven't missed a day in the last 20 months.
If the hardish evidence is valid, it's doing good things for my ageing body,
perhaps delaying the inevitable a tiny bit.
But that's the least of it. It's become a meditation, and a centrepiece to
my day.
On my farm in Vermont, I usually walk about five miles after I've finished
my day's writing; it's a time to unwind, reflect and, sometimes, work on a
problem. (I admit I carry a stubby pencil and little blank cards in my
pocket - I never break my pace, but I do sometimes record things when I
finish.) On the road - in the parking lot outside my Frankfurt-airport
hotel, amid the grimy 5am smog of Bangkok - I launch the day with a one to
three-mile chug.
As you can doubtless tell from this description, I've become a true
believer; which amuses me and my close friends - although a second-rate jock
in college (lacrosse), I was vociferously anti-exercise until I became a
fanatical advocate.
Thence the walking led to the breathing. Maybe one of these days I'll
emulate Chicago Bulls' basketball coach, Phil Jackson, and become a
full-fledged Zen Buddhist. (Yes, Jackson does say that he tried out his
Buddhist approach, successfully, on his eminence, Michael 'Air' Jordan).
Truth is, relaxing has never come hard for me. I go when I go. I stop when I
stop. In fact, and I realise this is unadulterated bias, I hold in contempt
my Type A friends whose weekend frenzy matches their workday pace.
But I do 'work' on the weekends. That is, I read insatiably, mostly fiction.
My purely professional reading, also a passion, rarely includes management
books (b-o-r-i-n-g), and tends strongly toward history. Business schools (on
both sides of the Atlantic) ignore economic history to their great
discredit. James Grant's Money of the Mind: Borrowing and Lending in America
from the Civil War to Michael Milken, for example, taught me more about
finance than several courses at the highly esteemed Stanford Graduate School
of Business. My inability to slug it out on a TV show with US Labour
Secretary Bob Reich on industrial policy led to a thrilling four-week summer
adventure - reading up on the early days of the industrial revolution in
America. If I had to do it all over again, I'd take my degree(s) in economic
history or the history of technology.
In fact, my reading 'programmes' have become the mainstay of my official
summer vacations. About 10 years ago, Kate and I got into the habit of
renting a house somewhere (the Dordogne, western Ireland) for three or four
weeks. And I got into the habit of getting slightly organised about my
reading on these mini-sabbaticals. It has been a pure, unadulterated joy.
Whether my breaks last 30 seconds or 30 days, they are of the utmost
importance to me. This is the wrong age to go stale.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Management: Desert Island Manager - Tim Hely Hutchinson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN MULLIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tim Hely Hutchinson, 40, is chief executive of Hodder Headline, Britain's
fifth-largest publishing group. His company's diverse backlist includes the
Bible and Le Carre as well as The Hello] Cookbook.
What would you need, apart from fax and telephone, to run your business?
I wouldn't even try to run the business from a desert island. I'd hand over
the reins to someone else until I could get a boat back.
You can have a vehicle to get round the island.
A horse. I like horses. It would be far more versatile than a car and
something of a companion.
If you could take one person with you, who would it be?
It would have to be somebody very practical. Yes, I'd take Capability Brown.
He could knock the place into shape and organise the fishing.
Confined to an island, what would you miss most?
Friends and family, obviously. I would also miss my house which I've spent
two years doing up and from which I'll finally be dragged feet first.
What would you miss least?
Boring meetings. Most people in business spend far too much time in
meetings. I am always telling colleagues that they should have taxi meters
on their heads - they'd be horrified by the amount of money they'd wasted in
even one meeting. It is very rare that I feel that a meeting is truly
productive.
You can teach a parrot one edifying sentence or motto.
The thing I least like in business is people repeating back to me something
I'd told them in the first place, as if they'd thought of it themselves. So
I'd probably teach it to shut up.
You can take one film.
Just one? Very mean. The complete set of Le Carre's George Smiley television
series.
And one book.
Again, I'm going to be greedy and take the complete works of Flaubert. He
spent an average of seven years writing each book, so they bear endless
re-reading.
What would you eat and drink?
I hope Capability Brown will catch the fish. I like avocados and I assume
that there are groves of exotic fruits on the island. Oh, and a lobster pot.
One condition can be imposed on the island.
A perfect marble bathroom, full of fresh water, washed up on it after a
storm. That would mean I wouldn't have to turn into the Wild Man of Borneo.
It would be nice also if the island could have a race course, but I suppose
that's asking too much.
If marooned on the island for the rest of your life, how would you like to
be remembered?
I'd like my epitaph to read: 'Departure from plan'. I am known to family and
friends as 'the planning department', to the point sometimes where
spontaneity is lost. I would have taken belt and braces precautions to
prevent myself being washed up on a desert island. So people would be
interested in the comedy of errors which led up to it.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Management: Almost caught in the mouse trap - Ian Rodger
asks whether Logitech can remain Swiss and independent in a fiercely
competitive industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If there is one certainty for companies in the fast-changing personal
computer industry, it is that no strategy will be successful for long.
Logitech, which leads Microsoft by a short head as the world number one in
mice for computers, with more than a third of the market, has in its short
13-year life changed course radically four times. It expects further shocks
as a matter of course.
'We always think we have done enough, but we never have,' says Daniel Borel,
the group's co-founder, chairman and chief executive.
In the process of perpetual adjustment, the Swiss-based group has moved more
and more of its activities to the US and East Asia, and thus become less and
less Swiss. Its experience again revives the perennial question of whether
any Europe-based group can stay the course in the rough and tumble of this
global industry.
Logitech was given its start in 1981 when two Italian electronic engineers,
Giacomo Marini and Pierluigi Zappacosta, came together with Borel, a Swiss
engineer. The three had met at Stanford University in the mid 1970s.
Their initial view was that the mouse would be attractive only to
specialised computer users, such as engineers, and would be sold directly to
them. Volumes would be relatively small, so it would not make sense to
manufacture it themselves. However, after winning a contract to develop a
mouse for Hewlett-Packard, the US computer and electronics multinational,
they changed their minds.
They bet correctly that HP and other computer makers would become the big
buyers of mice, including them in their computer kits alongside the
keyboard. They also realised that these original equipment makers (OEMs)
would only buy from a supplier which made its own mice, and preferably from
one that was close at hand, so that quality could be checked and deliveries
secured.
Thus began the exodus from Switzerland. Logitech set up manufacturing in
California in 1984 and within a year had 10 large OEM contracts and annual
output of 300,000 units. Two years later, it began production in Taiwan for
Asian OEMs (including the Asian plants of US suppliers, such as Apple) and
in 1988 started a factory in Ireland aimed at European PC makers. By 1990,
production in Switzerland had been halted.
But margins on OEM business were thin, and the group soon saw that it also
had to break into the fast-growing US retail market under its own brand if
it was to generate adequate profits. It could not afford to set up its own
distribution network, so it sold directly through the increasingly effective
channel of PC magazine advertising.
This helped Logitech build its sales to SFr124m (Pounds 60m) in 1988, and to
become something of a mini-multinational, complete with a listing of its
shares on the Swiss stock exchanges. Borel remained at group headquarters in
Lausanne with responsibility for finance and product development, while
Marini and Zappacosta directed worldwide marketing and software development
from Silicon Valley in California.
By then, the group's biggest concern was that the mouse was becoming a
mature product, with little potential for further technical development.
That meant it would become a commodity sold on very thin margins against
increasingly stiff competition from low-cost, East Asian producers.
In common with many other companies in this situation, Logitech began
looking for opportunities to diversify, although with no illusions about the
dangers. 'It is easy to make sub-products, but very difficult to find a
second mouse,' Borel says.
It rapidly evolved a diversification strategy. Although the company intended
to keep close to areas it understood, the strategy has taken it into
demanding new markets some of which have required extra skills.
Logitech's mission, the directors decided, was to humanise the PC, to
provide it with senses - not only the touch supplied by the mouse, but also,
gradually, sight and hearing. A family of products called 'Senseware' would
be developed.
In 1988, the group acquired the licence to a hand-held scanner and has since
developed a full line. More recently, digital still cameras have been
developed. So have 'soundcards' (circuit boards); these are expected to
become popular as the market for sophisticated home entertainment computer
systems grows.
Sales and profits maintained brisk double-digit growth up until 1991,
suggesting the group was on the right track. However, a potentially fatal
flaw emerged in its structure.
The three main production centres outside Switzerland were building up their
staff to become largely autonomous, each with product development,
manufacturing and marketing activities. Initially, this process was endorsed
by the directors because it gave the group a strong local image in each
region, both with customers and with potential key employees.
But the disadvantages of such a loose federalism - costly duplication of
effort, diffused market intelligence and unco-ordinated R&amp;D spending  - soon
came back to haunt Logitech.
In 1992, a vicious PC price war broke out. Coincidentally, demand for
Windows software, which requires the user to have a mouse, boomed. On the
one hand, Logitech was faced with a dramatic increase in demand for its
products, but on the other it was forced to slash its prices.
'It was fine to charge Dollars 120 (Pounds 77) for a mouse when the customer
was paying Dollars 5,000 for his PC. But when PC prices went much lower,
people expected to pay less for a mouse too,' says Rory Dooley, business
unit director for pointing devices. Today, mice retail for around Dollars 20
in the US.
Revenues in the six months to October 1992 sailed ahead a brisk 25 per cent,
but cashflow slipped to a negligible SFr0.3m and the group suffered its
first loss of SFr5.1m. With a reported equity base of only SFr90.2m and net
debts of SFr111.6m a few months earlier, Logitech could not afford to
sustain losses of this size for long.
The immediate solution was obvious if painful. Production costs had to be
lowered sharply again. With the factories in Taiwan and Ireland running well
and a new China venture in the works, the high-cost California factory could
be shut down.
Marini, who was responsible for US operations, resigned in protest, but
profitability was restored in the following six months and has been
sustained ever since - though not without hiccups.
This latest radical shake-up also meant jettisoning the assumption that
production had to be located near the headquarters of the main PC
manufacturers.
Since the 1992 crisis, Borel has moved to Silicon Valley to control
operations and keep a close eye on the all-important US market. Only the
finance function and some high-end product engineering remain in
Switzerland. The home country remains valuable as a source of top-quality
engineers and as a test market because of the company's standing as the only
significant Swiss player in the world computer industry. But of Logitech's
2,400 payroll, only 100 work in Switzerland.
In an admission which speaks volumes for the pressures under which the
company is working, Otto Kunkel, vice-president, finance, says an ambitious
research programme has also been reined in because 'we cannot afford to look
ahead 10 years, we are too small'.
Profits recovered quickly, and the group managed to close the year to March
31 1993 with net income of SFr8.9m, down 57 per cent on the previous year.
In its latest year to March 1994, net income more than tripled to SFr27.8m
on sales up a handsome 17 per cent to SFr484.2m. But Logitech's recovery had
soured in the first quarter of this year (the group's fourth fiscal quarter)
when a fresh round of PC price cutting and a shift in sales patterns caught
the directors by surprise and profits slumped.
In an unusually blunt statement in May, the company explained why sales in
its fourth quarter dropped 6.6 per cent and profits were below expectations.
'The introduction of new products at the end of the third quarter did not
stir up customer demand as anticipated, while sales of the more traditional
lines were slow.'
Sales of PCs continued to grow at about 15 per cent in volume but zero in
value, according to Kunkel. 'How do we cope,' he asks. Answer - yet another
round of cost cutting.
While finely priced OEM deals remain the backbone of the business, new
models of mice have been designed to try to breathe new life into the
flagging retail market - some cordless, some shaped for left-handers, some
for use with portable computers.
The main new product that did not stir up customer demand as expected in
late 1993 was a low end sound attachment called Audioman. PC users have
already moved on to high-quality soundcards, a market which is dominated by
Creative Labouratories of the US. Logitech has just introduced a soundcard
called SoundMan.
With camera sales still tiny, the group's diversification strategy has
certainly progressed slowly. Mice and other pointing devices still account
for nearly 80 per cent of revenues.
Only in scanners did it get off to a good start. They now account for close
to a fifth of its sales and it claims a leading 45 per cent world share of
hand-held models. But as one company official points out, a scanner remains
a luxury option for most PC users.
Another problem - not mentioned in the fourth-quarter statement - has been a
significant shift in US PC marketing patterns which Logitech was slow to
spot. More and more PCs are being sold in department and chain stores rather
than in specialist shops, forcing the group to refocus its marketing efforts
there.
Is it all worth it? Borel looks weary and admits that, as a founder, he has
found it 'emotionally draining' to deal with the many personnel problems
arising from the past few years' upheavals. 'You realise that we grew
initially on heart and soul. Now we bring in the professionals. They are
cold and financial, and the two clans hate each other.'
But he is still convinced the group is on the right track and is excited
about the much heralded potential of the home computing market. 'We are
dedicated to our original vision to humanise computing,' he says.
'We believe that Senseware's future markets will mature, evolve and flourish
in parallel with computing technology itself because successful technology
must be 'human-centric' no matter what its application,' he said in his
latest annual statement.
Apart from the sheer competitiveness of all Logitech's markets, he says the
main problem is deciding when the time is right to push into new areas. 'It
is so easy to expand in markets that are not yet ready.'
Is Logitech determined to remain Swiss, European and independent? This is
not an issue at the moment, but Borel does not rule out joining another
group at some point. 'We are living through an important stage in the
history of this industry. The important thing is to be part of the game.'

FT  22 AUG 94 / Economic gloom continues to fade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Public opinion about employment prospects and the state of the economy
continues to improve, according to the latest FT/MORI Mood of the Nation
index.
While the nation would appear still to be pessimistic overall, the index has
risen since April, its lowest point this year and only one point off the
lowest level since the index started in April last year. That low point of
79 was reached in October.
The belief that the mood can only get better, at least in the short term,
has led to some changes in the way the index is being presented. While
national pessimism was reflected previously in a rising index, using a 100
base set in April 1993, the graph has now in effect been flipped on its head
so that that the gloom factor is represented by a depreciating figure and
higher spirits by a rising one.
While there is some stirring of optimism, it would be more accurate to say
that people are slightly less pessimistic than they were a year ago.
The results of the survey show that nearly one in three managers and
executives are concerned about losing their jobs in the next 12 months, a
marginally smaller ratio than a month ago.
The changes in attitudes remain quite subtle and a further analysis of
managerial anxiety shows merely that the depth of concern among some is not
quite what it was.
Concerns deepen when the 35-to-44 age range is considered. Some 40 per cent
of people in this grouping are worried about losing their jobs.
Professor Robert Worcester, chairman of MORI Financial Services, the index
compiler, said: 'What these findings reflect most of all is a middle-class,
middle-aged malaise.'
Some 26 per cent of this class think the economy is going to deteriorate and
only 35 per cent of them think it will get better.
However, pessimism remains even deeper among manual workers. Only 20 per
cent of them can see any prospect of improvement. Prof Worcester said:
'While things appear bleak to the middle classes, they still look worse to
the working class.'

FT  22 AUG 94 / Union role stressed in work schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unions can have a beneficial effect on performance-related pay schemes even
though most disapprove of them, says a study by Kingston University.
It argues that union involvement in devising the schemes encourages more
objective measures of performance, ensures effective monitoring to prevent
discrimination and leads to insistence on fair appeals procedures.
The survey of 61 unions and staff associations found that most disliked the
use of the schemes. Just under three-quarters of unions said some of their
members had experienced the schemes while nearly 40 per cent said they were
'one of the most pressing problems with which they were currently dealing'.
The majority believed that the schemes did not improve management-employee
relations. More than a third said they had generated a demand for union
protection among employees. Two thirds of the unions said the schemes were
being used by companies who wanted to 'minimise union involvement'.
In spite of union opposition, only two unions - the IRSF tax officers' union
and the Natfhe education union - had sought to resist the schemes by
industrial action. More commonly, unions said their response had been to
increase training for negotiators, improve communications with members and
develop advisory services.
The report says: 'The union response to PRP in many cases bears the stamp of
'managerial unionism' in which members are treated rather like consumers
whose needs must be researched and then met through well-promoted union
services provided by a trained and professional corps of representatives.'
It adds: 'Employer preparedness to involve unions was the dominant influence
on union success. The success of unions in shaping PRP is partly a product
of union pushfulness. Unions which are more demanding are perhaps less
likely to comply readily with management proposals and are more effective in
regulating management decision-making.'
The report concludes: 'It is fashionable to suggest unions must moderate
their policies towards employers if they are to continue to represent their
members' interests. Our findings contradict this advice and suggest that
more oppositional unions may be better at wringing concessions from
employers than their more moderate counterparts.'

FT  22 AUG 94 / Bonuses seen as route to end yearly pay rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Increasing use of bonus schemes is paving the way for an end to the annual
pay rise, a report suggests today.
The report by the Confederation of British Industry and Wyatt, the human
resource and actuarial consultancy, says that employers are broadening their
use of incentive and profit-related pay schemes.
The adoption of such variable pay systems partly reflects a desire by
employers to use them as a lever to break away from or reduce the annual
rise in basic pay to which many remain committed.
The growing popularity and sophistication of the schemes is arousing
suspicion among some employees since they involve unconsolidated pay. For
the same reason they are attractive to employers who want greater
flexibility in their pay arrangements and want to reduce their pay bills if
business deteriorates.
Mr Oliver Overstall, Wyatt's UK director of compensation strategy, said: 'It
is almost incredible that with record low inflation rates, many UK
organisations still ratchet up their fixed pay costs by incremental
additions to base pay.'
The survey, which analysed 300 schemes in 100 companies, defines variable
pay, widely adopted in the US, as the 'at risk' part of a wage packet,
covering individual bonuses, team incentives, gain-sharing, share schemes,
profit-sharing and spot awards - one-off payments for a job well done.
The most generous types of variable pay, it says, are restricted share
schemes and key-contributor schemes, usually confined to senior management.
These can sometimes be worth up to 100 per cent of basic salary.
The survey says that performance measures vary between different classes of
staff. Profitability, revenue or income generation are most common among
middle and senior management. Quality and speed are often used for clerical
and supervisory staff. Production volume and quality measures tend to be
adopted for manual workers.
Companies are using different systems for different purposes, says the
report, which says variable pay is not replacing performance-related pay but
often complements it.
Profit-related pay schemes approved by the Inland Revenue are gaining in
popularity. Nearly one in 10 private-sector employees are covered by such
schemes which give tax relief on an amount of pay linked to profit.
One-sixth of those surveyed said they planned to introduce or extend a
profit-sharing scheme in the next two years.
Mr Overstall said: 'If UK employers want to maintain the competitive edge
they have fought so painfully to achieve, it seems evident that they should,
as quickly as possible, move the bulk of any pay increases into the truly
variable element of their compensation framework.'
This would give them a more flexible pay platform, he argued, and added:
'The demise of the universally held notion of the annual pay rise could then
be on the cards in the UK.'

FT  22 AUG 94 / Insurer to speed training reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sun Alliance is to speed up plans to merge the training of its life
insurance direct sales force and that of 'tied agents' - financial advisers
who sell its products - after recommendations from regulators.
The insurer, one of the UK's largest, received a report from Lautro, the
life industry watchdog, this month and told its agents just over a week ago
that the training merger would be brought forward.
Mr Mike Austen, managing director of Sun Alliance's life and pensions
operation, emphasised that Lautro's report had not found any area where the
competence of any sales agent was in doubt and had not identified any issues
relating to investor protection.
The changes being made are similar to those being carried out in other life
companies.
After visits from Lautro, both Norwich Union and Nationwide building society
took the more drastic course of suspending their financial services sales
forces temporarily for retraining. Both later decided to reduce sharply the
number of authorised agents.
The size of Sun Alliance's life and pensions sales force, including tied
agents, has dropped by almost a third from 1,700 in June 1993.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Check-off wins companies' support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The check-off system for paying union subscriptions directly from pay
packets helps in 'promoting good industrial relations', say 53 per cent of
companies in an Institute of Manpower Studies study.
Only 5 per cent see the strengthening of trade union organisation in their
company as a disadvantage, while the costs of its administration are not
seen as a problem.
The survey, published today, shows that the legislation introduced last year
requiring trade unions to seek approval from their members every three years
for check-off will have only a 'modest' impact on existing arrangements.
Only six cases were found of companies withdrawing from check-off and none
were due to the rule changes.
Check-off is seen as important by companies for efficiency and co-operation
in industrial relations.
A number of trade unions believe they have secured new members as a result
of the legislation and their subsequent campaigns to secure membership
approval, although others are concerned that they will lose members.
After September 1 a union member will be able to take legal action against
their employer if the subscription continues to be paid without their
approval.
Both the GMB general union and the MSF technical union are claiming new
members and a net gain in their total membership, although many unions have
expressed concern that they will suffer a net membership loss.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Women 'beating men for top jobs'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Women prove more successful than men when they are competing for senior
management positions, statistics released by an executive recruitment
consultancy show.
The survey, which focused on 85 posts in the Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 75,000
salary range handled by the London office of NB Selection, found that from
the shortlisted candidates for the posts one in four women, compared with
one in six men, secured management positions.
The company also examined a sample 31 vacancies covering 3,000 applicants
and found that, proportionately, women again fared better. Some 22 per cent
of women applicants secured interviews compared with 10 per cent of male
applicants.
Ms Elisabeth Marx, head of NB Selection's psychological assessment practice,
said that while significantly fewer women applied for jobs in comparison
with men, 'it is obvious that the women who apply are of higher calibre'.
One of the reasons behind the better success rate, she suggested, was that
women tended to apply only for those jobs for which they were sure they
fulfilled all the criteria whereas men were more willing to chase jobs for
which they might not have every qualification.
She urged women to be less conservative about their job applications,
'otherwise they may be lessening their chances of securing positions which
they deserve'.
She added: 'We should not lose sight of the fact that significantly fewer
women are applying in comparison to men.'

The costs of subsidising a proposed new pension regulator could prove
excessive for pension schemes and employers, the Chartered Association of
Certified Accountants warns in a submission to the Department of Social
Security.
The association is concerned that the plan, set out in the government's
pensions white paper, could create an open-ended funding liability.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Body Shop defends position on ethics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Body Shop International, the cosmetics group whose watchword is
environmental soundness, yesterday defended itself against reports over the
weekend which raised questions about its green credibility and ethics, Alan
Cane writes.
An article in the Financial Times on Friday which reported that Franklin
Research Development, a US ethical investment fund, had advised its clients
to sell Body Shop shares 'did not fairly represent the position', Ms Angela
Bawtrie, in charge of investor relations, said.
Mr Gordon Roddick, Body Shop chairman, was not available for comment but is
believed to be writing to the FT to set out his interpretation of the
situation.
Reports in other newspapers that Body Shop paid two US businesswomen Dollars
3.5m in 1987 for the Body Shop name and that a US journal Business Ethics
will shortly publish an article critical of the company's Trade Not Aid
policy - buying supplies from indigenous people in developing countries -
were not denied but shrugged off as 'old news'.
Franklin, which manages about Pounds 350m in funds on behalf of 300 clients
interested in ethical investment, changed its recommendation for Body Shop
shares on July 15. It is understood it had been concerned about increasing
competition in the company's core markets coupled with worries about
forthcoming press reports. Over the past few weeks it has sold about 50,000
Body Shop shares.
Ms Bawtrie said yesterday that Body Shop had been told by Franklin that it
would not be against buying the company's stock again.
Body Shop does not dispute that Franklin changed its recommendation, but
argues its relationship with the fund is sound and that it is working with
Franklin on a new company analysis. Its shares slipped 4p to 238p on Friday.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Disabled Remploy staff to hold strike ballot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unions are to hold a strike ballot among disabled workers at Remploy, the
manufacturer at the centre of a row over the government's decision to remove
its status as a priority supplier in line with a European directive on
public procurement.
The GMB general union, with the largest membership among a six-union
consortium at the company, said that many members in the Remploy workforce
were in a mood to take strike action over pay and conditions.
Feelings were running high, it said, because of the way Mr Michael Portillo,
the employment secretary, made it clear that he would be complying with the
directive without seeking to challenge it.
Union leaders are angry at the way that the company's offer to increase
basic pay by 2.5 per cent has been linked to proposed changes in working
conditions.
The GMB says that the proposals covering shift work and working hours will
effectively bar the most severely disabled from working at the company.
At present disabled workers are considered suitable by Remploy if they are
able to work for 28 minutes in every hour but the company wants to change
this to 40 minutes an hour. The move would affect pay because bonuses are
based on these times.
Remploy has made the offer conditional on acceptance of a scheme designed to
cut down on absence levels. The company also wants to introduce shift
patterns outside normal office hours which, the unions say, will increase
the difficulties of getting to work for some disabled people.
Union officials say the proposals reflect a harder management approach to
industrial relations. They say this is out of step with the original spirit
of the company.
The conditions have reinforced union suspicions that the government is
seeking a more competitive climate at the company. Mr Portillo disputed
earlier accusations that his department's decision to drop the special
status for disabled workers in winning government contracts was motivated by
a desire to subject such suppliers to greater market pressure.
Mr Phil Davies, the GMB national officer for Remploy workers, said: 'This
government has decided to mount an all-out attack on disabled people. The
unions are fully prepared to defend these workers - our case is strong and
just.
'The strings attached to the offer will cause tremendous hardship for these
workers. Flexible working and the changes to the work timetable could mean a
12-hour day for a disabled person with no overtime pay.'
Mr Kevin Barron, Labour's employment spokesman, said the proposed change in
working conditions for Remploy staff 'appears to be a further step in the
government's attack on disabled people'.
Mr Barron accused the government of seeking to force disabled workers to
compete without assistance. 'The sort of people who work for companies like
Remploy simply cannot compete in the marketplace in the ideological way that
the government talks about,' he said.
Remploy said that some proposals, including those on job grades, the bonus
scheme and flexible working, were topics put forward for discussion. It was
only seeking a commitment from the union to discuss these issues. Union
officials said, however, that it was made clear that the company would be
seeking changes.
The pay offer, said Remploy, was in line with public-sector guidelines. The
strike ballot, which closes on September 8, is being held by five out of the
six unions in the consortium.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Boots reaches for gas mask defence: The chemist is being
sued by staff over its wartime use of asbestos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boots, the chemist, retailing and pharmaceutical group, will receive within
the next month High Court writs from up to 20 women claiming compensation
for injuries allegedly caused by their working with asbestos in a Nottingham
factory making gas masks during the second world war.
The cases follow an out-of-court settlement in the US last week which could
lead to the compensation of 100,000 Americans who contracted diseases after
being exposed to asbestos. The settlement, costing Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds
830m) involves 20 asbestos companies, including T&amp;N, which was the major
supplier in the UK.
The writs against Boots will claim negligence. Mr Richard Meeran of Leigh
Day, the London solicitors acting for the women, said the writs would say to
Boots: 'You ought to have been aware, probably were aware, of the risks at
the factory. You should have provided adequate protection. As a result of
this omission, they (the women employed at the factory) developed
asbestos-related diseases.'
Mrs Doris Roe, 77, and Mrs Florence Sewell, 83, both of Nottingham, have had
applications accepted for the legal aid necessary to pursue the case. A
further 18 applications are outstanding, said Mr Mike Ward, secretary of the
Asbestos Related Diseases Association, which is shepherding the cases to
court.
The Boots factory in Nottingham employed 1,200 people. It was one of four in
the UK making gas masks during the war. The others were in Birmingham,
Blackburn and Leyland.
Mr Ward claimed the inhalation of asbestos fibres led eventually to the
deaths of 200 former employees of the plant between 1965 and 1992. Such
inhalation can lead to respiratory diseases under the general heading of
asbestosis and mesothelioma, the growth of tumours on the lining of the
lung.
The incidence of asbestos-related diseases and the cost of compensating
those who contracted them has led to a sharp decline in the production and
use of asbestos. But in the 1940s one of its uses was as a filter in gas
masks.
The Asbestos Related Diseases Association has taken up the question of
compensation for the Nottingham employees directly with Boots and wants a
Pounds 5m fund established.
The Boots legal department met Mr Ward and Mr Meeran on July 21. The two
sides agreed to meet again but no date has yet been set. Mr Meeran said work
to establish a compensation fund and the pursuit of the legal cases against
Boots would run concurrently.
Mr Mike Gates, head of pharmaceuticals public relations at Boots, said of
the compensation fund: 'We don't essentially have any problem with that. But
this is not just a problem for Boots.'
He noted that the gas masks were made to government specifications: 'We
didn't want to make them, we were told to.' Boots had no past experience of
making asbestos-related products and it has not made any since the war.
'Resolution of the problem has to involve all the gas-mask manufacturers and
the government,' Mr Gates said.
Mr Ward claimed that the working conditions at the Boots factory did not
comply with the Factories Act 1937. But Mr Gates said 'the Boots plant was
considered to be state-of-the-art at the time' and its design was duplicated
elsewhere.
The original Boots gas-mask plant was bombed and destroyed, forcing the move
of production elsewhere. The present Boots management has no knowledge of
the technology used in the gas mask manufacture. However, Mr Meeran said:
'All the women we've spoken to had the same story: they had no protection.'

FT  22 AUG 94 / Lib Dems tax shake-up proposes top rate of 60%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrats are poised to announce a radical package of tax and
benefit measures which would take more than 50,000 people out of taxation
and impose a top tax rate of 60 per cent on incomes over Pounds 100,000.
Mr Alan Beith, the party's deputy leader, will announce the proposals this
week in a paper expected to become policy at the party conference next
month.
The paper proposes the introduction of three higher rates of income tax at
unspecified levels, together with the integration of the tax system with the
national insurance and benefits systems.
Liberal Democrat officials said no decisions had been taken on the structure
of the higher tax rates, or the thresholds at which they would take effect.
However the paper guarantees a top level of no more than 60 per cent.
The paper suggests that a number of existing tax reliefs valued by
middle-income taxpayers should be abolished, including mortgage interest tax
relief and the married couples allowance.
It proposes a transfer of resources to finance a range of extra benefits
designed to have the greatest impact on those with lower income.
The proposed benefits include an increase in child support of Pounds 5 per
family and the removal from the tax net of 50,000 low-paid workers by
equalising the threshold for income tax and national insurance payments.
Party officials said the system was intended to increase the fairness of the
tax system by improving benefits for the lower paid and making income tax
payments more progressive than has been the rule under the Conservatives.
Tough controls intended to maintain the quality of television and radio
broadcasting will be proposed today by Mr Robert Maclennan, Liberal Democrat
media spokesman.
The proposals would remove regulatory supervision of broadcasting from the
government. Regulation of the BBC, ITV and independent radio would be
transferred to an Office of Broadcasting.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Economists find worrying fall on the supply side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Economists have found fresh cause for concern about the health of the UK
economy - a reduction in the supply of economists.
British schools are apparently producing instead a generation of would-be
entrepreneurs who see business studies as a route to fulfilment.
Mr Paul Walton, economist with James Capel, the UK securities house, says in
a report that the number of candidates for A-level in economics  - often
termed 'the dismal science' - hit a 20-year low this year at 30,885, a drop
since last year of 15.2 per cent. It peaked at 43,500 in 1983.
While the pass rate has improved to 78.4 per cent (up from 63.7 per cent in
1978), Mr Walton says it has not kept up with other subjects - only social
sciences and computing have worse failure rates.
Charts produced by James Capel show a 'tentative relationship with the
economic cycle', and Mr Walton argues that the result is likely to be 'a
smaller band of more rigorously trained economists'.
The sharp fall in A-level economics has been balanced by a rise in
applicants for business studies, which was introduced as a subject only 15
years ago. Applications for the subject, which concentrates on financial
analysis and management science, rose by 9.9 per cent this year to 24,920.
Mr Walton's analysis for James Capel suggests that the rise of the stock
market, and the 'cult of the businessman', have encouraged this trend. He
adds that pass rates have improved to 80.2 per cent this year, from 49.5 per
cent in 1978. However, the proportion earning the top 'A' grade remains the
lowest for any subject, at 6.6 per cent.
Figures for numbers of full-time undergraduates at UK universities show that
the trend is continuing in higher education. The numbers studying business
and management studies rose by 12.9 per cent this year.

FT  22 AUG 94 / University staffing trails student rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Academic staffing levels have failed to keep up with rising numbers of
full-time students in UK universities during the past four years of
expansion, government statistics published today show.
While student numbers at 'old' universities - excluding former colleges and
polytechnics upgraded to university status from 1992 onwards - have risen by
34 per cent over the past four years, the number of full-time academic staff
has risen by only 13 per cent.
The rise in staff numbers was concentrated on research while the number of
teaching staff increased by only 7.6 per cent, said Mr David Triesman,
general secretary of the Association of University Teachers.
Mr Triesman said this meant the average ratio of full-time students to
teaching staff had risen from 10.6:1 to 14:1. He said: 'Treating
professional staff as if they were machines that could be set to run faster
and faster places a low value on quality in higher education, which is
suffering from go-stop planning and gross underfunding.'
There has been a cut of 30 per cent in public funding per student since
1980, says a report produced for the Committee of Vice-chancellors and
Principals, which represents universities, by London university's Institute
of Education.
The report predicts 'continued financial stringency', and said 'no change of
government would alter the broad outlook to any significant extent'.
It suggested that universities' strategic plans should incorporate the
possibility of a period of consolidation, for reasons including 'the
capacity of the labour market to absorb very rapid increases in graduate
numbers' and 'the maintenance of acceptable quality'.
The proportion of students winning first-class honours degrees has risen by
50 per cent in 11 years to 9 per cent, from 6 per cent in 1983.
The statistics also reveal that numbers of mature students have risen
substantially, with 18 per cent of new full-time undergraduates being aged
21 or over - compared with 10 per cent 10 years ago. Part-time students also
showed an increase - of 11 per cent - on the previous year.
Subjects enjoying the largest increases among undergraduate entrants last
year were law, computer studies and psychology, while teacher training and
nursing saw a decline in new recruits.
Expansion has raised the number of women in higher education - they account
for 23 per cent of academic staff (up from 15 per cent 10 years before), and
for 47 per cent of full-time undergraduates (from 42 per cent a decade
earlier).
However, men still outnumber women by six to one on engineering and
technology courses and three to one in mathematical sciences.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Political donations 'might not be accepted'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Donations from companies attracted by the moderate tone of the new Labour
leadership might not be accepted, the party suggested yesterday.
'We don't want to see a system of big donations from individual companies to
political parties,' said Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor.
'We think that in a democracy, the vast bulk of money must come from
individuals.'
Mr Brown's comments follow suggestions that Marks and Spencer, the retail
chain, was considering donating to the party. The reports were played down
by the company.
Labour is believed to be working on plans to regulate political funding
through laws giving shareholders more control over donations.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Labour makes fairness its theme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday signalled plans to focus its campaign for the next general
election on fairness as it tries to sustain the favourable publicity
generated by Mr Tony Blair's election as leader.
Targets will include executives of privatised utility companies who have
made millions of pounds from share options. They will be contrasted with
elderly people struggling to pay value added tax on domestic fuel bills.
As Mr John Major returned to London from his summer holiday, Mr Gordon
Brown, the shadow chancellor, said fairness would be at the heart of a
Labour government led by Mr Blair.
'What people want in this country is the restoration of a sense of fair play
and fair dealing in our community. It is something that has gone missing,'
he told BBC television.
'We believe in a fair society, not based on envy or malice, but on fairness.
I think people want to see social cohesion in Britain, and that is why Tony
Blair's theme of rebuilding Britain as a community has struck such a chord,'
he said.
Labour's emphasis on the word fairness echoes the attempts of the party's
modernisers, led by Mr Blair and Mr Brown, to distance themselves from the
class-based policies of the 1970s.
Party strategists believe that promises of fairness in areas such as
taxation and health will strike a chord with middle-class voters, especially
in the south of England.
The strategy will be balanced by attacks on the government's handling of the
economy, and the inequity of its approach to taxation and the health
service.
'The issue in the next election will be between high taxation under the
Conservatives and fair taxation under Labour. The Conservatives have become
the party of high taxation,' Mr Brown said.
However, the strategy risks angering traditionalist supporters of Mr John
Prescott, Labour's deputy leader, who has called for a firm commitment to
progressive taxation, implying higher taxes for many voters.
Mr Major will spend next week at home in Huntingdon planning ways of
exploiting gradual improvements in the economy to rebuild the government's
popularity.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Brown pledges to curb bank charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banks and building societies would face legislation to cut the cost of
customers' service charges under proposals outlined by Labour yesterday.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said the next Labour government
would act quickly to curb the growth of charges, which have nearly doubled
in six years.
Figures produced by Mr Brown's office suggest that service charges levied by
the nine biggest banks and societies rose from Pounds 7.5bn in 1988 to
Pounds 13.4bn in 1993. The charges cover services such as arrangement and
overdraft fees, unauthorised overdrafts and returning or stopping cheques.
Mr Brown said banks would be required to tell customers about changes in
charges before implementing them. He said that all charges should be
published, to allow customers to compare fee scales.
Labour will release full details of its proposals later this week in a
policy paper timed to exploit public unease about the announcement of
healthy profits by some of the big banks.
Barclays recently announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.04bn in the six
months to June 30, compared with Pounds 335m in the same period last year.
Midland Bank's interim profits rose Pounds 58m to Pounds 443m.
However, banks said that advance notification of charges was already
required by the end of 1996 under the voluntary code of banking practice.
Most of the main clearing banks plan to bring in pre-notification more
quickly, and some have already done so. Lloyds and Barclays said they had
already taken action on other points raised by Mr Brown, such as sending
customers a tariff of all charges.
Both banks have also abolished some of the most unpopular charges, such as
the fee for sending account-holders a letter to inform them that they are
overdrawn.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Lib Dems propose tough controls on broadcasting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tough controls to maintain the quality of television and radio broadcasting
will be proposed today by the Liberal Democrats.
Mr Robert Maclennan, Liberal Democrat media spokesman, will also call for a
widening of the restrictions on monopoly satellite television coverage of
prominent sporting events such as the FA Cup final, Wimbledon and the Grand
National.
The proposals would remove regulatory supervision of broadcasting from the
government for the first time since the BBC was established in 1927.
Regulation of the BBC, ITV and independent radio would be transferred to an
Office of Broadcasting appointed by a two-thirds majority of the Commons.
The plans, contained in a paper for the Liberal Democrat conference in
September, are intended to reinforce diversity and quality in broadcasting.
The paper says that popular-journalism standards have fallen steadily for 20
years because of tough competition in a shrinking market, leading to
'ruthless' sensationalism.
'A similar development could occur in British television unless the BBC is
reinforced . . . and unless the broadcasting regulator is encouraged to be
tough with any erring ITV franchise holder,' it says.
The paper says the BBC should continue to be funded through the licence fee,
but should make more effort to sell its programmes to raise extra funds.
It also suggests that the BBC should directly challenge BSkyB, the satellite
TV broadcaster in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake.
The paper says the BBC should set up satellite channels to concentrate on
its traditional strengths such as news, comedy, and natural history.
It adds that greater competition is the key to maintaining the quality of
satellite services, rather than direct regulation.
The paper says that Mr Rupert Murdoch should not have been allowed to
establish control of BSkyB in addition to more than a third of daily and
Sunday newspaper circulation.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Fuel famine cripples air transport in Nigeria: Paul Adams
takes a much-delayed flight from Lagos to the political capital of Abuja
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Getting a domestic flight was easier in Nigeria before the oil workers went
on strike and the jet fuel ran out. Last week in Lagos, the rush was for a
ticket to Abuja, the federal capital where jailed opposition leader Moshood
Abiola was due to appear in court charged with treason for saying he won the
election.
There are no trains unless you have a week to spare and it is a 10-hour
drive to Abuja. The roads appear to have been shelled by heavy artillery but
the pot-holes are there because the road is not maintained and the twisted,
charred vehicles on the roadside are the result of bad driving.
The last scheduled flight on Okada airlines to Abuja was at 3 pm. There is
no such thing as a check-in time at the terminal, a sprawling row of gloomy
sheds, and often there is no such thing as checking-in. Touts swarm around
passengers, and work with the men in airline uniform and, occasionally,
security forces in plain clothes.
'Okada - you have to pay more,' they yelled at the passenger gate by the
runway. The price had doubled from N1750 (Pounds 22) that morning to N3500.
Okada's operations manager confirmed it. 'Its because of the shortage of
fuel,' he said.
The extra money was about to be paid when it transpired there was no 3
o'clock flight any more. 'It's because of fuel,' they said again. Back came
the extra money and the ticket (now useless) and one of the airline staff
led a large posse of touts to get the one remaining flight to Abuja, which
was from the other terminal.
The 'last flight' was a Russian made Tupolov 134, with 'Maina Air' written
on its side. It was not an airline I had heard of. 'It means chief in the
Kanuri language,' said another passenger. The Bulgarian crew looked
reluctant. They had barely enough fuel to fly to Abuja and back. They were
finally persuaded, perhaps by the Kanuri chief, to get in the cockpit.
I sat opposite a former government minister, going to Abuja for a
constitutional conference, meant to decide the fate of Mr Abiola.
The crew informed us that they had decided to fly, very slowly, to Abuja via
Kano, which is in the same direction but exactly twice as far, and there
re-fuel, and fly back to Abuja. Everyone groaned, then went very quiet for a
minute or two after take-off, which was a little shaky. For the first time
in recent memory, someone said he wished he had gone Nigeria Airways. 'You
definitely feel that you are in a cabin,' said the retired minister.
We headed towards the Atlantic coast, circled round the mass of creeks west
of Lagos and climbed above the cloud. We reached the arid north, where the
former minister pointed out his home town clearly visible beneath us.
When we landed at Kano, one of the stewardesses took out a bag full of
money, taken from the flight's ticket sales, and went off in search of fuel.
Inexplicably, there was none.
The passengers strolled around the deserted tarmac, spoke for hours on their
cellular phones to Lagos and Abuja and discovered old friends and
acquaintances were on the flight.
A well-known trade union leader, now relieved of his job, earnestly
explained that tomorrow Chief Abiola would be released on a great day for
democracy in Nigeria, then he strolled with his entourage to the Kano
airport VIP lounge.
A pair of headlights appeared half a mile across the runway and headed
slowly towards the aircraft. It was the fuel tanker and by 8 o'clock the
aircraft was ready to go, arriving in Abuja five hours after we left Lagos.
It is normally a 50-minute flight.
The next day, the judge in the high court case resigned because no one
trusted him, Chief Abiola went back to his cell, and everyone else stayed
put because there were no flights.
Nigeria Airways was the only flight out of Abuja and the captain actually
apologised for a slight delay. On board were some more trade union leaders.
Twelve hours later Gen Abacha announced that they had been relieved of their
jobs. The airlines are still searching for jet fuel, Chief Abiola is
somewhere in custody and Nigeria is still waiting for the dawn of democracy.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Taiwanese projects in China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Taiwan has approved proposals for 31 investment projects in China totalling
Dollars 60m (Pounds 38.9m) and will further relax restrictions on investment
by local companies in China, the Economics Ministry said at the weekend.
The moves signify a further step in the liberalisation of investment by
listed Taiwanese companies across the Taiwan Strait, until recently subject
to strict government controls. Small companies have been investing in China
since the early 1980s, largely through indirect channels.
Taiwan has banned direct trade, investment and transport links with China
since 1949, forcing the bulk of such activities to be routed through Hong
Kong.
The recently approved investments by Taiwanese companies include a Dollars
6m container terminal project by Evergreen Marine, part of the Evergreen,
one of the world's biggest container shipping lines. The project marks
Evergreen's first foray into China following an announcement in May it
planned investments amounting to Dollars 80m.
A total of 633 items will be moved from a prohibited list and to a permitted
investment list for Taiwanese manufacturers, the Economics Ministry said.
The newly approved list includes 196 textile items, 188 machinery items and
eight steel-related items.
The combined export value of the 633 items was Dollars 22.6bn in 1993,
accounting for 27 per cent of Taiwan's total exports, the ministry said.
Imports of the items amounted to Dollars 6.14bn or 8 per cent of the total.
A fourth typhoon in two months pounded Taiwan yesterday on leaving three
people dead and two missing, Reuter adds from Taipei.
Typhoon Fred brought 180mm of rain across northern Taiwan overnight and
early on Sunday, and as much as 480mm in mountain districts, days after
torrential rains from Typhoon Doug caused floods in the southern city of
Kaohsiung.
Most domestic flights and many trains were cancelled as the storm, with
winds of up to 180kph, swept across the north of the island.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Hawke's political memoirs hit a wave of criticism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The queue in the Miranda Shopping Centre in one of Sydney's southern suburbs
was modest but persistent. For 90 minutes, it shuffled slowly forwards,
never dropping below two dozen people. At its head sat Mr Bob Hawke,
Australia's prime minster until late-1991, signing copies of memoirs with
patience and flourish.
The recently published book has caused a storm in Australia, largely because
of its highly personalised attacks on Mr Paul Keating, Mr Hawke's successor
and the current prime minister. But for the most part, Saturday's shoppers
were quietly supportive of their former leader. 'I'm going to get him to
sign it for my granddaughter - he was a good prime minister,' remarked one
woman.
Assistants from Angus &amp; Robertson, the bookstore handling the promotion,
said sales had been brisk.
Not everyone was enthused, though. One teenager, hanging over the railings,
thought this was a curious way for a former prime minister to be spending
his time. 'Look at Malcolm Fraser, he's going round for CARE Australia,' she
said in reference to the former conservative prime minister's work for the
aid agency whose profile has been raised by the Rwanda crisis. Another lady,
flicking through the memoirs noticed the ADollars 49.95 (Pounds 24) price
and was blunter. 'I wonder how much he gets out of it ?' she asked.
Dollars from sales appear forthcoming, but there has been a lack of critical
acclaim. Most local commentators view the book as an effort at
self-aggrandisement, with Mr Hawke anxious to ensure the credit for prising
open the Australian economy in the 1980s is laid at his door.
In the process of claiming sole credit for the reforms of the 1980s, Mr
Hawke - who held power for eight years and won an unprecedented three
elections - has missed few opportunities to do down his successor, who
served as Treasurer during much of the Hawke government. The bad blood
between the two has been evident ever since Mr Hawke tried to duck out of
the 'Kirribilli agreement', under which he would step down in favour of Mr
Keating after the 1990 election. It took a bruising fight within the
Australian Labor party before Mr Hawke was forced to relinquish the reins.
By the end of last week, the former prime minister appeared weary of taking
a barrage of criticism over the book, but was still talking tough. 'I knew
it would cause some unhappiness,' he said, when asked if he had been
surprised by the reaction. 'But the facts have to be told.'
Mr Keating has kept out of the fray. There was only one tart comment, as he
unveiled a series of 'Open Learning' programmes for TV. This he said was
'not the only launch today, but I'll bet pounds to peanuts this one has a
longer-term influence on Australia'.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Panic as French quit Rwanda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUKAVU
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France pulled its last troops out of Rwanda yesterday, triggering chaos at a
border crossing as Hutu refugees tried to storm across into Zaire, Reuter
reports from Bukavu.
After being blocked by Zairean troops firing into the air, the refugees last
night were streaming south along a riverside trail to another border
crossing eight miles away.
The rush to the Ruzizi border post leading into Bukavu broke out less than
half an hour after 150 French Legionnaires crossed into Zaire, signalling an
end to the French humanitarian mission in Rwanda.
Ethiopian United Nations peacekeepers stood by helplessly as hundreds of
refugees swarmed across a rickety bridge and tried to overrun the Zairean
border post.
While the Zairean troops stopped the rush to the border post, other refugees
managed to swim across the river or to get across using straw mats as
makeshift rafts.
The chaotic scenes provided an unwelcome background to the end of France's
controversial two-month humanitarian mission.
Now that the French have left, the Hutus fear reprisals by members of the
Tutsi tribe, who have ousted the former government and seized power in
Rwanda.
The Hutus have voiced suspicions of the 800-strong Ethiopian contingent,
which is part of the 2,200-strong African UN mission in Rwanda. They suspect
the Ethiopians may be sympathetic to the Tutsis.
The French pulled out despite concern by the UN and aid agencies about the
implications for the south-western Rwanda protection zone they had guarded.
French officials say there are 2.5m people in the 'safe zone' against only
1.9m in the rest of Rwanda.
In the last two days more than 45,000 Hutus have managed to cross into
Zaire, joining many thousands of others already there.
Zaire said the border closure at Bukavu was motivated by a fear of a huge
refugee influx like that at Goma recently. Some relief officials also voiced
fears of a new exodus. 'We're trying to prevent them clogging up the town
because it is an absolute death trap,' said one aid worker.
The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said trucks today would
ferry Rwandans split from their families by the abrupt closure back to
Bukavu and funnel others to new camps on the outskirts of the settlement.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Great reformer near to his meeting with Karl Marx: Tony
Walker looks back over the 15 years since Deng Xiaoping's assumption of
supreme power in China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Chinese capital, in the bleak winter of 1979, was one of the more
forbidding places on earth. Icy winds from Siberia gusted down through the
city and a brief 'Peking spring', in which faint dissenting voices were
heard, had chilled with the arrest of the more adventurous spirits.
Reporters would gather in the cold near a grimy bus station to observe
progress of a flickering pro-democracy movement whose members pasted their
dazibao or 'big character' posters on a wall facing the city's main
boulevard.
Those were uncertain times in China. Observers of the Chinese political
scene might complain now about an opaque system that reveals little of its
inner workings, but in the days when Mr Deng was re-asserting control, the
picture was much murkier. Journalists were reduced to driving late at night
around the Great Hall to check whether an important meeting was in progress.
In those strange early days of the post-Mao era we would monitor, as best we
could in a twilight political world, the fortunes of one man, Mr Deng
Xiaoping, then a spritely 75-year-old, who was beginning his rise and rise;
although no-one in that era could (or did) forecast just how far Mr Deng
would ascend to claim the 'mandate of heaven'.
Today, the frail and reclusive Mr Deng turns 90. He is hailed as the
architect of China's remarkable transformation from a closed, inward-looking
society traumatised by the mass political campaigns of the Mao-era to a
country apparently on the way to becoming a powerful economic force.
All this economic promise was hardly the subject of even the most fanciful
speculation in China of the late 1970s as Mr Deng began to take control at
the fateful third plenary session of the 11th Communist Party Congress in
December, 1978. Then, the talk was about whether the reformists could break
the shackles of Maoist dogma and dare even to begin dismantling the peasant
communes and establish a system of free markets.
It was not at all clear in those days whether Mr Deng and his reformist
faction would triumph over the 'whateverists' (those who vouchsafed that
'whatever' Mao said and did was right). It is perhaps hard to believe now
that we might have doubted Mr Deng would prevail, but in late 1979 and early
1980 a great deal of uncertainty permeated the political atmosphere.
Indeed, it was one of those unheralded and un-reported occasions in early
1980 that Mr Deng signalled in a speech to several thousand cadres in the
Great Hall that he had more or less wrested control from his opponents,
among them die-hard Maoists, party conservatives, and those who were nervous
about a new broom. It was in that speech that the redoubtable Mr Deng laid
down what were described as the 'great tasks' for the 1980's and 1990's,
including his call for a quadrupling of China's GNP by the year 2000.
When the 'secret' speech was finally published several months later after
being circulated and debated among the tens of millions of communist party
members, his GNP target was ridiculed. At the time we wondered if Mr Deng
may not have been dreaming.
With debate in China consumed by the nitty gritty of economic reform, it is
worth recalling that Mr Deng's early battles after he re-emerged in 1977 -
he was purged twice during the Cultural Revolution of 1966-1976 - had much
less to do with economics than they did with laying to rest the ghosts of
the past.
Thus, he recognised that before China could get on with the business of
joining the modern world, it was necessary to address the legacy of Mao
Zedong. He supervised personally the 1981 Resolution on the Party History
which concluded that while Mao had made mistakes, he had also made a great
contribution to China.
Ever the pragmatist, Mr Deng argued at the time 'that to build up Mao's
errors too much would only damage the image of our party and our country,
and harm the prestige of the party and socialist system'. Preservation of
party control at almost any cost has been one of Mr Deng's cardinal
principles. A fear of chaos, should that control unravel, has never been far
from his concerns. These worries have fed an authoritarian streak consistent
with his behaviour throughout a long career.
Mr Deng may go down in history as one of the century's great reformers, but
he has not tolerated dissent. On two occasions in the post-Mao era he
suppressed ruthlessly political movements that did not square with his
vision of an orderly society under party control.
The first occasion was the arrest and detention for 15 years of Wei
Jingsheng, the 'democracy wall' activist who had criticised Deng directly in
his political testament, titled the 'Fifth Modernisation'.
On the second, Mr Deng was ultimately responsible for the suppression of
Tiananmen protests of 1989 with unnecessary loss of life. China's senior
leader has evinced no remorse publicly for either of these actions, and nor
is he likely to in these fading moments.
Inevitably, accounts of Mr Deng's achievements on his 90th birthday have the
ring of an obituary about them. The end for China's senior leader must be
fairly near judging by his appearance when he was shown on television in
Shanghai early this year, but it is also true that Mr Deng has shown an
extraordinary tenacity throughout a turbulent life.
He has said that he hopes to visit Hong Kong after it returns to China's
rule in 1997, and while few would give him much chance of realising his
dream, he has confounded the sceptics before and achieved other goals that
seemed out of his reach.
Not least of these achievements is surviving well beyond the date when Mr
Deng, with his maudlin wit, had expected to keep his appointment with Karl
Marx.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Key parties absent from Algeria talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A national dialogue aimed at reducing the violence in Algeria is unlikely to
resolve the situation because of the absence of three key protagonists.
The talks, sponsored by the president, were scheduled to start in Algiers
yesterday. The Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), which was set to win the
general election suspensed in 1992, has not been invited to attend. Two
senior leaders of the lay opposition, Mr Hocine Ait Ahmed, who leads the
Socialists Forces Front (FSS) and Mr Mouloud Hamrouche, a former prime
minister and prominent member of the National Liberation Front (FLN) have
argued that in the absence of FIS leaders and a radical overhaul of the
existing political system, the talks were pointless.
The two junior Islamic parties, Hamas and Ennahda, will attend the talks as
will the FLN which held power from 1962 to 1991. However, the absence of Mr
Hamrouche who, when prime minister from September 1989 to June 1991,
legalised the FIS robs the FLN presence of much of its meaning.
Meanwhile, in a letter addressed to the head of state, Gen Liamine Zeroual
one month ago and made public yesterday, one of the two paramount FIS
leaders has repeated his party's insistence that the military-backed regime
must free FIS leaders. Mr Ali Benhadj, who has been held in the military
prison of Blida since June 1991, said that the FIS and the Islamic Salvation
Army (AIS), which owes allegiance to the FIS, should meet the government and
debate publicly the country's future. He also says that 'in supporting the
dictatorial junta', western countries are committing 'two crimes, against
the Algerian people, and against their own nationals (living in Algeria) by
putting them at risk'.

FT  22 AUG 94 / LME probe into Chilean futures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Codelco, Chile's state copper company, yesterday said the London Metal
Exchange had agreed to investigate 'unusual transactions' between Codelco
and several brokers that contributed to losses of up to Dollars 270m (Pounds
174m) for the company on futures trading last year.
Codelco will this week send a formal report to the LME detailing operations
in 1993 by Mr Juan Pablo Davila, Codelco's chief futures trader, many of
which had 'no commercial explanation whatsoever'.
Mr Juan Villarzu, Codelco president, said an Ernst &amp; Young investigation
showed 'the existence of systematic deceit aimed at distorting the economic
outcome of copper futures transactions, creating fictitious profits and
postponing losses'. However, he stressed that this did not necessarily imply
that the brokers concerned had deliberately colluded with Mr Davila.
The announcement of a possible LME probe follows a recent visit by Codelco
officials to regulatory authorities in London and Washington when they
presented initial findings of the Ernst &amp; Young report.
'LME executives said they were fully prepared to begin the appropriate
investigations after receipt of a written request by Codelco, which will be
sent in the next few days,' Mr Villarzu said.
Mr Villarzu said Ernst &amp; Young had discovered oper-ations between Codelco
and London brokers that would have been illegal on the Comex exchange in New
York. 'This is not the case on the London exchange whose regulations in this
respect are much less demanding' and based principally on 'good faith and
gentlemen's agreements'.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Linus Pauling, leader in chemistry: Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Linus Pauling, one of the great figures of 20th century chemistry, has died
at the age of 93. He was the only person to win two solo Nobel prizes in
different disciplines.
Pauling won the Nobel Chemistry Prize in 1954 for his work on chemical
bonds. This gave scientists a theoretical framework for understanding the
forces that hold atoms together - and a practical guide for predicting the
structure and shape of new molecules. Pauling's research is the basis for
the computer programs used today in the pharmaceutical industry to design
new drugs.
His second Nobel award was the 1962 Peace Prize, in recognition of his
tireless campaigning against nuclear weapons testing. His anti-bomb petition
to the United Nations, signed by 11,000 scientists from across the world,
helped persuade the US, UK and Soviet Union to sign the 1963 atmospheric
test ban treaty.
But Pauling is probably just as well known today for his scientific crusade
over the past 25 years in favour of vitamin C. He believed that huge doses
of vitamin C - two spoonfuls per day, or hundreds of times more than the
officially recommended daily allowance - could help stave off illnesses from
colds to cancer and prolong healthy life by more than 20 years.
Pauling himself was a good walking advertisement for mega-doses of vitamin
C. He remained mentally and physically active into his 90s, writing a dozen
research papers a year, and his gaunt figure, topped with blazing blue eyes
and bright white hair, was a familiar sight at scientific meetings.
However, Pauling did not win the scientific and medical establishments over
to his view of the virtues of vitamin C.
Although mainstream researchers have become more aware of the health
benefits of vitamins since Pauling began campaigning, most regard his claims
as grossly exaggerated. Indeed some privately pointed to Pauling as a
warning to successful scientists not to become obsessed with cranky ideas in
their old age.
Pauling was born, bred, lived and died on the US West Coast. He grew up in
Oregon, the son of a small town pharmacist who used the slogan: 'Pauling's
Pink Pills for Pale People' and from whom he derived his love of chemistry.
After studying chemical engineering at Oregon State University, he moved to
the California Institute of Technology for graduate studies in 1922, at the
age of 21. Cal Tech was to be Pauling's base for the next 41 years, during
which he developed his Nobel-prize winning theories of chemical bonds and
struc-tures.
Chemists will remember Pauling above all for his book, The Nature of the
Chemical Bond, published in 1939 and without doubt the most influential
chemistry book written this century.
He died on Friday night at his Californian ranch in Big Sur.

FT  22 AUG 94 / China tightens credit for projects to curb inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China will clamp down on lending for capital spending, following the release
of figures that showed an alarming 73 per cent rise in fixed asset
investment in July compared with the same month last year.
Central Bank officials have made clear that credit ceilings would be
tightened in the third quarter after an easing in the past few months to
accommodate the demands of state enterprises for working capital.
Mr Zhou Zhengqing, a deputy governor of the People's Bank, was quoted as
saying that 'banks must strictly adhere to credit ceilings in order to
control lending for fixed asset investments.'
Beijing has announced that it will review all new capital spending projects
under the state plan, and those that 'do not enjoy good prospects' will be
cancelled. The official Xinhua news agency quoted government officials as
emphasising the need to 'check excessive capital construction in order to
avoid economic disorder.'
Government attempts to curb fixed asset investment by state enterprises
reflects continuing concern over inflation, which began to climb again in
June and July after falling back in previous months.
Consumer prices in China's 35 main cities in July rose by 22.7 per cent in
July compared with the same month last year. This was the same as the June
figure, but higher than May.
The authorities blamed a capital spending binge last year for inflationary
pressures. A stabilisation plan, introduced in July 1993, was aimed at
calming an overheating economy and curbing investment in fixed assets.
A western economist in Beijing described July's capital spending surge as a
'warning signal', while cautioning against reading too much into one month's
statistics.
But senior Chinese officials, including Mr Zhu Rongji, senior vice premier
in charge of the economy, who have been meeting at the beach resort of
Beidaihe near Beijing to review economic developments, are clearly concerned
about latest trends.
Central bank officials said that among targets in the latest crackdown on
unauthorised lending would be illegal interbank transactions. Non-bank
financial institutions would also come under greater scrutiny.
Adding to official concern is the fact that capital spending normally grows
faster in the second half of the year, with the third quarter the peak
period for starting new projects.
Chinese economists attributed the jump in capital spending in July to
projects launched by state enterprises whose financial position had
improved, and to the government appropriating more funds for infrastructure.
It has earmarked Yn520bn (Pounds 39bn) for capital spending in its credit
plan this year. By the end of June Yn175bn had been outlayed.

<TEXT>
Nigerian police yesterday arrested the sacked leader of a striking oil
workers union, the latest detention in a crackdown on opponents of the
military government, Reuter reports from Lagos. Mr Frank Kokori, former
general secretary of the Nupeng trade union, has been a powerful force
behind the six-week strike aimed at forcing the military to hand over power
to presidential claimant Chief Moshood Abiola, who is now on trial for
treason.
A colleague, Mr Wariebi Agamene, the sacked president of the union, said
Kokori was arrested in the early hours of the morning. Kokori and Agamene
were dismissed by military ruler General Sani Abacha on Wednesday along with
leaders of another oil union and the umbrella labour federation.
Nearly a dozen people were arrested nationwide in a swoop on Friday but many
others were later released. Among those still detained are Anthony Enahoro,
vice chairman of the National Democratic Coalition (Nadeco), a 71-year-old
politician who was in the forefront of push for independence from Britain in
the 1950s. Others are Mr Cornelius Adebayo, a former deputy state governor,
a Nadeco leader and two aides of Chief Abiola - his spokesman Mr Fred Eno
and Mr Ademola Adeniji-Adele. In an effort to break the strike, the
government has asked retired oil workers to register at their local job
centres with a view to being re-engaged.

FT  22 AUG 94 / US toughens policy on links with Cuba
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING and Agencies
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MIAMI, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US further toughened its Cuba policy at the weekend. The stronger
measures against President Fidel Castro's country followed Washington's
announcement on Friday that Cubans fleeing the Caribbean island as refugees
would be barred from the US and detained at Guantanamo, the US base in
south-eastern Cuba.
President Bill Clinton said on Saturday he was barring cash remittances by
Americans to Cuba and putting new limits on charter flights between the US
and the island. Scheduled flights have long been discontinued under the
30-year US embargo on its trading with Cuba.
Mr Clinton also pledged increased and amplified US radio broadcasts into
Cuba, warning residents not to go to sea and head for the US.
With the spotlight of attention shifting from the refugee problem and onto
the US agenda to oust Mr Castro, Mr Leon Panetta, White House chief of
staff, said yesterday that imposing a blockade on Cuba was not out of the
question. 'That is obviously one of the options that we would look at in the
future, as we see whether or not Castro begins to make some legitimate
movements toward democracy,' he said on television in the US.
He added that the US was committed to foster democracy in Cuba, as well as
to end the wave of illegal emigration to Florida by flimsy boats and rafts.
'At the same time, we have to continue to put pressure on Castro because the
problem is not with refugees - it is within the Castro regime.'
However, administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
later that Mr Panetta had been referring to blocking trade from other
countries with Cuba. Such an idea is on a long list of US options, but the
officials said there was no active effort to implement a blockade.
Mr Newt Gingrich, Republican minority whip in the House of Representatives,
yesterday accused President Clinton of failing to flesh out his Cuba policy.
'This administration has a passion for taking one or two steps without
working out what the rest of the trip is,' Mr Gingrich said, calling on Mr
Clinton to look for a smooth transition to democracy and a liberal economy
in Cuba.
It remains to be seen whether the change in US policy towards Cuban
refugees, whose predecessors were welcomed in the US and offered the
possibility of permanent residence status after one year, will deter further
attempts to cross the Florida Strait. The US Coast Guard in Florida picked
up 1,189 people on Saturday, the highest total of such Cuban boatpeople in
one day this year and nearly three times the number of such Cubans who
reached the US in the whole of 1990.
However, the Cuban-American community in Florida appears to acknowledge the
need to stem the flow of would-be immigrants to the US as refugees from the
island. A survey of 240 Florida residents, by the Miami Herald, showed 66
per cent support for Mr Clinton's decision and 43 per cent not wanting
detained refugees given a chance to apply for asylum.
Governor Lawton Chiles of Florida, and all those likely to challenge his bid
for re-election in November, approved a tough stance on Cuban refugees, an
indication of how they judge the attitude of non-hispanic voters in Florida.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Black civil rights leader dismissed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The firing of Mr Benjamin Chavis as executive director of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People brings to an end one of
the most tumultuous episodes in the 85-year history of the oldest and
largest US civil rights organisation.
Mr Chavis, a fiery preacher who has sought to bring younger and more radical
blacks into the NAACP, was sacked by a nearly unanimous board of directors,
after an eight-hour emergency meeting in Baltimore on Saturday.
The board said Mr Chavis had 'embarked on a course of conduct which is
inimical to the best interests of the association.'
The immediate cause of his dismissal was the controversy over a Dollars
332,000 (Pounds 214,000) settlement reached, using NAACP funds, with a
former assistant who had charged him with sexual discrimination and later
with sexual harassment.
Mr Chavis has denied the charges. He said after his dismissal that he was
'the victim of an orchestrated campaign to defame my character and my
integrity.'
The allegations threw fuel on a deeper argument over the philosophical
departure which Mr Chavis had sought to bring to the NAACP.
In the organisation's heyday - the 1950s and 1960s, when it won a series of
civil rights victories in the US courts and the Congress - its leaders used
to keep to the country's integrationist mainstream, allying itself with
Jewish groups and white liberals, but shunning black nationalist leaders
such as Malcolm X.
Mr Chavis, in contrast, has lately held meetings with urban gangs and, most
controversially, has sought to embrace Mr Louis Farrakhan, head of the
Nation of Islam organisation.
Mr Farrakhan outstrips other US black leaders in his appeal to young urban
blacks. But his anti-semitism has made him the object of fierce argument.
Mr Chavis's overtures to him have repelled many of the remaining Jewish
backers of the NAACP, as well as many black moderates, and have turned away
some corporate contributors.
The debate will continue to simmer after Mr Chavis's departure. NAACP
leaders in the 1950s regarded the go-it-alone ideas of the black
nationalists as 'segregated thinking', but such ideas have since been linked
with the 'empowerment agenda' of conservative political thinkers.
This brings a response from many black activists, who feel the time has come
for organisations such as the NAACP to move away from a programme basically
aimed at getting white people and white institutions to change, and to
concentrate instead on self-help within the black community in the US.
Mr Chavis's successor will have to cope not only with this philosophical
divide, but also with a series of organisational problems.
Precise facts about the NAACP's finances and membership are unclear. Mr
Chavis and his opponents continue to argue about whether he inherited a
financial deficit and whether he has increased membership. The organisation
itself has refused clarification.
It appears certain, however, that the NAACP faces a deficit of about Dollars
3m, worsened at least in part by Mr Chavis's extensive travel programme and
by substantial pay increases he awarded to senior staff.
What's more, even if Mr Chavis has increased the NAACP's membership, which
some critics dispute, that increase has come overwhelmingly among young
members who pay much lower dues and thus are doing less to dig the NAACP out
of its financial hole.

FT  22 AUG 94 / International Press Review: Fretting about Fidel Castro -
Florida
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A slow-motion Mariel, as the current exodus of hundreds of Cuban migrants to
the US has been called because it resembles the 1980 boatlift of 125,000
refugees, was a human interest story early last week. The press, in chorus,
registered admiration for the courage of those crossing the Florida Strait.
Reference was made to the Mariel crisis, but the consensus appeared to be
that the news was about Cuban people, not US policy-makers.
There was, even so, perhaps some disagreement over policy. In a scrap that
seemed to go against type, a Wall Street Journal editorial advised against
lifting the US trade embargo against Cuba for fear of reviving President
Fidel Castro, while the Washington Post leader suggested that the US trade
embargo against the Caribbean republic, hand-in-hand with a US policy of
welcoming Cuban refugees, was responsible for the accelerating flow of
migrants and that US policy needed a rethink. In general, however, there was
not much to differentiate US newspaper coverage of the flight from Cuba.
But last Thursday night, when Ms Janet Reno, US attorney-general, announced
a reversal of Washington's 30-year-old policy on Cuban immigration and said
that would-be immigrants picked up off the Florida coast would be detained
at third-country safe havens, all that changed. President Bill Clinton
closed the door on Cuban refugees, but opened the debate on US relations
with Cuba.
On Friday morning, the Miami Herald, Florida's largest English-language
daily, endorsed a hard-line on immigration and called on the federal
government to relieve Florida of the burden of Cuban refugees. The editorial
revolved around a demand from Dade County, which incorporates Miami, to be
reimbursed for state and county expenditure on refugees, claimed to be
Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1bn) since the mid-1980s. The Miami Herald responded
to Ms Reno's comment that the federal government has spent Dollars 44m on
refugees this year by saying: 'Since Mariel, Dade and Florida have spent
many times that sum on refugees. They're a federal responsibility, not
ours.'
The fact that Mariel is a 'sad memory for many political North Americans'
was acknowledged by El Nuevo Herald, the Miami Herald's Spanish-language
counterpart. Although El Nuevo Herald comes folded into the English daily,
the thrust of its editorial was different. No reference was made to the
state's finances or the federal government's duties to protect Florida
residents. Rather, attention was on how to deal with Mr Castro. Headlined
'What are the Americans waiting for?', the leader railed against the US
administration, Was it waiting for 'television pictures of the bodies of
women, children and old people, massacred on Cuba's shores, before they
denounce the genocide before the United Nations?'
El Nuevo Herald called on Mr Clinton to take a 'golden opportunity' to use
the US 'free hand in the UN security council' to get a transition in Cuba to
free elections, the organisation of political parties and observation of
human rights - supervised by the UN.
In Diario Las Americas, a Florida Spanish-language daily, Monsignor Agustn
Roman, Auxilary Bishop to the Miami diocese and spiritual leader to most of
the Latin community there, concurred that the central issue is what happens
in Cuba. He warned against addressing the effects of the problem (the
exodus, one presumes) 'without dealing with its cause' (Mr Castro).
However, the divisions in Florida's coverage are by no means clearly along
Cuban-American vs. North American lines. Even in one edition of the Miami
Herald, there appears to be a variety of opinion over the merits of the 1966
Cuban Adjustment Act by which, until Thursday, the US had granted Cubans
fleeing their country refuge in the US and eligibility for permanent
residence status after one year.
On the Herald's front page, an article implied this was unfair: 'Cuban
refugees have been the privileged few, accorded rights no other group
receives', adding reference to the thousands of Haitians who have been
detained lately while trying to enter the US.
On the inside pages, however, barring access to the Cubans is represented as
an injustice: 'For 30 years it has been unthinkable to refuse asylum to
refugees from Cuba who crossed the liquid Berlin Wall that is the Florida
Straits  .. Clinton labeled the flight of refugees from Cuba 'illegal', a
word no-one would have used in the past to describe those fleeing hard-line
countries that were part of the Soviet bloc.'
But, after all, it's vacation time. The Citizen, the broadsheet in Key West
on the southern tip of Florida, reported holidaymakers' reactions under the
headline: 'A state of emergency, where?'

The Cuban-American community in Florida appears to acknowledge the need to
stem the flow of would-be immigrants to the US as refugees from the
Caribbean island.
Even so, the community is showing a mixture of outrage and resignation, as
well as relief, at Washington's decision to change its policy.
Now those fleeing Cuba are apt to find themselves back on the island - in
detention at the US base of Guantanamo.
The change in US policy to Cuban refugees, which until last Thursday was
welcoming those fleeing the Castro regime and offering them the possibility
of permanent residence status after one year, did little to deter those
launching their rafts from Cuba's northern shore to cross the Florida
Strait.
The US Coast Guard in Florida reported it had picked up a further 1,189
people on Saturday, the highest one-day total so far this year and nearly
three times the number of such Cuban refugees who arrived in the whole of
1990.
As the US administration continued to refine its policy, on Cuba, President
Bill Clinton seems to have won support in both Florida's non-hispanic and
established Cuban-American communities for closing the door on refugees.
A survey of 240 Florida citizens, by the Miami Herald, showed 66 per cent
support for Clinton's decision and 43 per cent not wanting detained refugees
given a chance to apply for asylum.
Governor Lawton Chiles of Florida and all rivals likely to challenge his bid
for re-election in November approved a tough stance on Cuban refugees, an
indication of how they judge the attitude of non-hispanic voters in Florida.
Mr Jorge Mas Canosa, chairman of the Cuban-American National Foundation, the
community's most powerful lobby, endorsed the Clinton administration's
decision.
Fears of second-generation Cuban-Americans well established in Floridaw ere
put clearly by Eduardo, a student of dentistry from Miami, who said: 'The
people coming over are Cuba's garbage. They give Cubans who have come over
here and worked their way up a bad name.'
The Transit Centre for Cuban Refugees at Key West, on the southern tip of
Florida,was empty of would-be immigrants by Saturday morning, but full of
disappointed relatives who had come down from Miami hoping to be reunited
with family and friends newly picked up at sea and brought ashore. There was
an angry demonstration.
Mr Lincoln Daz Balart, a Miami Republican and one of three Cuban-Americans
in the US Congress, said that Mr Clinton's reversal of policy on Cuban
refugee immigration demanded an equivalent change towards a tougher approach
to dealing with President Fidel Castro of Cuba.
'If you're going to have a Haitian-style immigration policy for Cubans, you
should also have a Haitian-style foreign policy for Cuba,' Mr Daz Balart
said.
One of the fiercest critics of the long-standing US embargo on trade with
Cuba is Mr Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo, director of Cambio Cubano (Cuban Change)
in Miami. He advocates a 'good-neighbour policy with Cuba', involving
negotiations with Mr Castro to bring political democracy to the island in
return for a gradual opening of trade.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tens of thousands of refugees yesterday streamed out of Bihac, the Moslem
pocket in north-western Bosnia as UN officials said Bosnian government
troops had overrun it, Laura Silber reports from Belgrade.
Bihac has been the stronghold for nearly a year of a rebel Bosnian Moslem
leader, Mr Fikret Abdic, a communist entrepreneur. The destruction of his
effort to form a personal fiefdom in Bihac will bolster the Bosnian army,
which has used its important 5th Corps and could free up troops to fight
against Bosnian Serb forces elsewhere in Bosnia.
UN refugee officials said as many as 20,000 people had been displaced over
the weekend, according to unconfirmed reports. Panicked civilians were
trying to flee the dense Moslem heartland into Serb-held areas of Croatia.
'Roads are flooded by people.' said Mr Peter Kessler, spokesman for the UN
High Commissioner for Refugees. UN officials yesterday were trying to help
the refugees - some of whom were trapped in a mined no-man's land between
rebels Serb forces and Croatian troops.
Croatia so far has allowed 50 ethnic Croats to cross the border, said a UN
official. Rebel Serbs were chasing the refugees into the minefields, said Mr
Kessler.
Refugees started to leave the Bihac pocket when Mr Abdic's revolt began to
collapse last week. Bosnian army troops gained control of the dense Moslem
heartland early yesterday, reported Sarajevo radio.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Troubled skies cause blips in Athens: Radar worries and a
traffic controllers' row are raising tempers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So incensed were some Greek travellers at the delays caused by an air
traffic controllers' go-slow that they pushed aside the security guards and
staged an impromptu sit-in earlier this month on the runway at Athens
airport.
Since the start of the peak tourist season in July, both charter and
scheduled flights leaving the country's airports have been delayed by up to
three hours. Conditions are worst in the afternoons and at weekends, when
demand is highest for landing slots at Athens and at important tourist
resorts such as Rhodes and Heraklion on Crete.
Already under great work pressure, Greece's 380 air traffic controllers have
added to the summer temperatures by demanding a substantial real pay rise,
claiming they should be exempted from public sector wage restraints, which
restrict increases to 10 per cent this year to match the anticipated
inflation rate.
'We get seniority rises at the same rate as other Greek civil servants with
university degrees, but nothing to compensate for specialised skills, or for
doing a stressful job with inadequate equipment,' says Mr Panayotis
Tsoubelis, chairman of the controllers' union. 'The result is a higher staff
attrition rate than anywhere else in the public sector.'
Greece's transport minister, Mr Theodore Pangalos, agrees in principle that
the air traffic controllers are entitled to a higher salary scale, and more
training for what is becoming a steadily more demanding job. But he wants
the union to agree in writing to postpone its pay demand until next year.
The controllers decided to reject Mr Pangalos's terms just as the August
rush of charter flights started. The result is that, with tourist arrivals
forecast to rise by about 10 per cent this year to almost 11m, pressure on
the country's outdated air traffic control system has never been greater.
'There is a crush of traffic across Greek airspace in summer, with the
number of flights more than doubling to 1,500 a day,' says Mr George
Stamboulidis, a senior civil aviation official. 'But we still don't have the
facilities to ensure smooth flow management.'
Athens airport is among Europe's busiest, handling more than 10m passengers
a year. Yet it has only one runway and its air traffic control centre relies
on a short-range radar system dating from the 1960s. Outside its 40-mile
range, the air traffic controllers rely on talking to pilots over a VHF
radio link.
Says a pilot for a charter operator: 'After you've been cruising quietly
across Europe, Greek airspace seems chaotic. Sometimes the frequencies are
so busy you don't get a chance to give your position before making the
approach to Athens.'
A new approach radar for the Athens area was due to start operating in
mid-1992. It was intended as the first stage of a Dollars 46m (Pounds 29.7m)
turnkey project, awarded in 1991 to Thomson-CSF, the French electronics
manufacturer, to update Greece's air traffic control system to international
standards.
The new system would immediately increase Greece's air space capacity by at
least 15 per cent by providing full radar coverage. Traffic from important
Greek airports would move faster, as aircraft flying at the same altitude
and speed would no longer have to be kept 60 miles apart to ensure a
10-minute safety margin between flights.
Much of the Thomson equipment is now in place, but the new Athens approach
radar is not yet working. One senior Greek civil aviation official says:
'You expect delays on this kind of project, mainly because of local
topography. But the problems have gone on so long, we're beginning to think
Thomson's original specifications for the project were incorrect.'
Thomson says the radar is situated in a 'difficult environment' at Athens
airport, between a mountain and the sea, with several islands nearby. It
maintains that the system operates to international standards and is being
specially modified to satisfy the demands of Greek air traffic controllers.
The controllers complain that the radar, which gives a computer-controlled
image of an aircraft and its flight path, cannot be used in its present
form. Says one: 'The screen gives you wrong information - two aircraft when
there's only one, or no aircraft at all in one area when you already know
it's there. It's not reliable, so we switched it off.'
If the radar's problems cannot be sorted out by the end of the year, the
government may revoke the contract with Thomson and choose another system,
civil aviation officials say. In the meantime, tourists flying home from
Athens can resign themselves to a long wait on the tarmac.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Moscow warns on latest MMM offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The Russian government was moving anxiously yesterday to distance itself
from what promises to be an intriguing 'second act' of the MMM investment
fund crisis, which could begin today. The controversial financial pyramid
scheme, which appeared to be on the verge of collapse after a raid by tax
police earlier this month, has announced that today it will reopen its
offices and offer new 'MMM tickets' for sale.
The Ministry of Finance, which has come under fierce criticism for its
failure to stop the sale of MMM shares earlier this year, yesterday issued a
strongly worded warning about the new, heavily advertised, 'tickets'. The
original MMM share scheme, which attracted more than 1m investors, collapsed
earlier in the summer and police have arrested the fund's founder.
The ministry said the new 'tickets' were merely 'pretty postcards' and had
no official status as stocks. Investors in the tickets 'should not expect to
receive any revenues'.
Potential investors were warned that merely purchasing a stock did not
entitle them to shareholder rights. To enjoy full rights as a share owner,
the ministry cautioned, the stock must be formally registered at an
independent stock-registry office. This caution indicates that that Russia's
byzantine financial regulations, which have proved confusing to many
sophisticated western investors, could be part of the reason why so many
Russians have been seduced by the simple sales pitches of the investment
funds.
As the MMM fund, which authorities have described as a 'classic pyramid
operation', prepared for what could be a remarkable resurrection, the state
intensified its campaign against similar schemes throughout Russia.
The infectious popularity of funds like MMM, which promise immediate and
swift returns, presents a dilemma for the Russian government which hopes to
encourage the growth of capital markets but fears a public backlash if
capitalism is seen to bring impoverishment rather than prosperity.
Legitimate stockbrokers worry that the government will also turn its
new-found interventionist zeal to the booming stock market.
But popular rage over failing investment schemes is mounting. Over the
weekend, according to Moscow radio, disgruntled investors in the Russki Dom
Selenga, a central Russian fund whose operations were frozen last week,
smashed the windows of a branch of the fund in the Siberian city of
Cheliabinsk.
The government, seeking to rebuild credibility in the wake of the MMM
scandal, has stepped up its attack on Russki Dom Selenga, which company
officials say has more than 1.5m investors. Over the weekend, tax police
seized Rbs13bn (Pounds 4m) in cash from the Russki Dom Selenga branch in the
city of Ufa, in the Urals.
Similar financial crises could be brewing in other former Soviet republics.
The Alex Company, an investment fund in Azerbaijan, closed its doors earlier
this month, leaving investors penniless, but the Vahid fund, which claims
one quarter of the Azeri population as shareholders, is still doing a
booming business. One in 10 citizens in neighbouring Georgia have put their
money in a local pyramid scheme, hoping to protect their savings from
Georgia's hyper-inflation.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Milosevic struggles to pluck Bosnian thorn: The Bosnian
Serbs' sticking power has surprised the Belgrade president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With an unprecedented tirade against Bosnian Serb leaders, Belgrade at the
weekend began what it hopes will be a decisive push to seal an international
peace plan for Bosnia and shift blame for the war.
But President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia is finding his task more
difficult than he had calculated. An aide close to Mr Milosevic confided
that 'we did not expect it to be so hard to get rid of them.'
'Them' are the Bosnian Serbs, once equipped and nurtured by Belgrade and now
a problem as Serbia struggles to escape from the west's crippling economic
sanctions.
Mr Milosevic had begun preparing the ground for a split with Belgrade's Serb
brethren in Bosnia for a year, but he has ended up having to rush the job.
When the international community set a deadline last month for Bosnian Serb
acceptance of its plan for a partitioning of Bosnia and the Bosnian Serbs
rejected it, Belgrade ran out of time and imposed a land embargo against the
Bosnian Serbs on August 4.
Still, the Bosnian Serbs remain defiant. While playing down the conflict
with Serbia, Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, insists on going
ahead with plans to hold a referendum next Sunday on the proposed partition
map. It requires the Bosnian Serbs to hand over one third of the 70 per cent
of Bosnia they currently control and the referendum is highly unlikely to
approve it.
Thus, Mr Milosevic was likely to have been pleased yesterday when the
already-isolated Bosnian Serb leaders suffered another setback when rebel
Serb leaders from Croatia - in a move orchestrated by Belgrade - said the
unification of their self-styled Serb states should be postponed until after
the war.
That pronouncement fits neatly into a broader campaign taking shape in
Serbia to destroy popular support for the Bosnian Serb leadership. In a
fierce attack published at the weekend, a senior Serb figure accused Bosnian
Serb leaders of corruption and of 'repeatedly breaking their promises to
halt the bombardment and agony of civilians in Sarajevo'. For the first
time, Belgrade accused the Bosnian Serb leadership of being implicated in
atrocities against civilians.
In the newspaper interview Mr Zoran Lilic, the president of rump Yugoslavia
(Serbia and Montenegro) and a mouthpiece for Mr Milosevic, hinted that Mr
Karadzic was involved in the kidnapping and suspected murder of 21 Moslem
men - citizens of Yugoslvia - who were dragged off a train 18 months ago. He
said the incident was aimed at drawing Yugoslavia into war.
'We cannot allow three men in Pale (the Bosnian Serb mountain stronghold
close to Sarajevo) to determine the fate of all Serbs,' he said in reference
to the political troika which rules the self-styled Serb mini-state within
Bosnia.
Aides to Mr Milosevic hope that General Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb
commander, may be at odds with his leaders and may play a decisive role in
bringing them to heel.
The accusations from Belgrade may also signal a local crackdown on suspected
war criminals - another attempt to curry favour with the international
community and win the easing of sanctions. They follow calls from the
influential communist party, which counts among its leaders Mrs Mirjana
Markovic, Mr Milosevic's wife, to bring suspects to trial, some of whom
until recently were being doted upon by state-run Television Serbia.
Reports say Mr Milosevic is poised to arrest Mr Zeljko Raznatovic, known by
his alias of Arkan, a former MP and commander of the Tigers, a fierce
paramilitary unit which is accused by Croats and Moslems of atrocities in
Croatia and Bosnia, and Mr Vojislav Seselj, an MP who also commanded an
ultra-nationalist paramilitary unit.
The interview with Mr Lillic made clear Mr Milosevic's preoccupation with
finding a scapegoat - his Bosnian Serb kin - in order to secure a positive
role in Serbian history in a land obsessed with its past. His long
preparation for the break with Mr Karadzic involved the rekindling of
historical divisions between Serbs - communist partisans and royalist
Chetniks in the second world war - and Serbs from Serbia and those from
Bosnia over the frontier River Drina.
Mr Milosevic has resisted efforts to despatch international monitors to the
Drina, Serbia's frontier with Bosnia, on the grounds that this would expose
him to criticism from opposition parties.
He may, however, be afraid of his own allies. Elected as a nationalist in
1987, the current wisdom is that he has now turned his back on nationalism.
But taking on Mr Karadzic in Bosnia is one thing. He believes it is too
early to challenge nationalists within the ruling elite in Belgrade.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Sweden anxious for market verdict on budget plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden's financial markets, which over the past two months have been in
frenzied mood over the alarming state of the public finances, will today
give their verdict on the latest proposals from the Social Democratic party
for tackling the yawning budget deficit.
The package of tax rises and expenditure savings published by the Social
Democrats on Friday evening were a direct response to market fears -
expressed through the tumbling value of the Swedish krona and rising
long-term interest rates - that the country's biggest political party,
champion of the mighty welfare state and likely winner of next month's
election, was being dangerously vague about how it will deal with a public
debt that amounts to approaching 100 per cent of gross national product and
is still rising fast.
While the argument will rage on until the election over whether the Social
Democrats' SKr61bn (Pounds 5.06bn) savings package goes far enough, one
important principle at least now seems to have been established that unites
both the opposition and the four right-centre parties of Prime Minister Carl
Bildt's incumbent coalition.
It is that public debt must be stabilised by the end of the new government's
four-year term in 1998 and that renewed inflation, historically the
preferred Social Democratic way of getting out of financial trouble, must be
avoided.
This helped win the Social Democratic package a positive - if guarded -
initial response from Mr Bjon Wolrath, chief executive of the insurance
group Skandia, who triggered much of the market turbulence in June when he
announced Skandia would boycott government bonds until the political parties
produced a credible plan for dealing with public finances.
Mr Wolrath said he would be reconsidering the boycott in the light of the
Social Democratic proposals. 'On the presumption that there is a broad
majority in parliament to carry through strong measures, we will buy Swedish
bonds again,' he said.
But fierce debate over the extent and mix of measures needed to achieve the
double goal of reducing the SKr200bn budget deficit and fostering a
faltering economic recovery may yet continue to unsettle markets.
The first difference between the Social Democratic programme and that agreed
by the government parties lies in scale.
The government parties have proposed strengthening the budget by SKr101bn by
1999, SKr40bn more than the opposition, although SKr20bn of this total has
not been detailed. The Social Democrats are betting higher growth and a fall
in unemployment will help close the budget gap. If not, they will take
tougher fiscal steps.
But a problem for both sides may lie in a vicious circle of high deficit
costs crimping economic growth. The government's fiscal plan envisaged 3 per
cent annual growth in the second half of the decade; already next year's
growth forecast of 3 per cent growth has been cut to between 1 and 2 per
cent because of the effects of high interest rates.
The second big difference is over the mix of fiscal policy. The SKr61bn
Social Democratic programme consists of SKr27.4bn in tax increases - mostly
through raising marginal income tax from 50 to 55 per cent, restoring taxes
on dividends and raising capital and wealth taxes - and SKr33.6bn in
savings.
By contrast, the SKr81bn programme detailed by the coalition contains just
SKr15bn in new tax revenues, while cuts in transfer payments total SKr26bn
and (unspecified) cuts in public consumption a further SKr35bn. (The balance
of SKr5bn is accounted for by pension reforms).
Industry and business have been quick to criticise the Social Democrats for
over-emphasising tax cuts and not facing up fully to the need to cut public
spending, which accounts for 70 per cent of GNP.
Last week, Mr Lars Ramqvist, chief executive of Ericsson, the
telecommunications company, said tax increases would be a 'knife in
industry's back' just as most companies are returning to health after the
recession.
They would threaten Ericsson's ability to keep the highly skilled staff it
needs in Sweden, he said.

<TEXT>
Mr Bernd Shmidbauer, Germany's intelligence co-ordinator, will report to
Bonn today on how to combat international plutonium smuggling, following a
series of meetings with Russian security officials over the weekend.
Diplomats in Moscow suggested the initiative might lead to creation of a
joint task force and increased financial aid to tackle the lethal trade.
German authorities have uncovered several stashes of stolen plutonium in
recent months.
Mr Shmidbauer said the talks had been conducted in an excellent climate and
in total openness. 'I believe we will achieve excellent joint results and
good co-operation, and the questions which have been the subject of
speculation can then be solved,' he told German TV.
But tensions remained behind the smiles. Russian pride has been pricked by
western criticism of lax security. Intelligence officials have continued to
deny there is any convincing evidence that plutonium found on a recent
Lufthansa flight from Moscow to Munich had been stolen from a Russian plant.
Any nuclear material carried on to that aircraft would have been detected by
scanning equipment at Sheremetevo airport, they say.
German politicians, such as the foreign minister, Mr Klaus Kinkel, have
backed plans to provide more funds to convert Russia's nuclear programme to
more peaceful ends. Others have hinted at a tougher approach. Mr Theo
Waigel, finance minister, was quoted in the German press as saying future
financial assistance to Russia would be linked to co-operation in the fight
against nuclear smuggling.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Coalition tries to defuse Italian bank row

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Members of Italy's governing coalition tried over the weekend to play down
the significance of a dispute between the country's transport minister and
the central bank over a planned merger between two banks.
Mr Publio Fiori, the transport minister, publicly criticised the Bank of
Italy last week for allegedly ordering the Banca Nazionale delle
Communicazioni to hold a board meeting next Saturday to consider a merger
with Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, one of Italy's biggest banks.
BNC is controlled by the Ferrovie dello Stato, the Italian state railway. Mr
Fiori and fellow members of the right-wing National Alliance believe the
interests of the railways would be better served if BNC accepted an offer
from a smaller bank, Cassa di Risparmio in Bologna.
The Bank of Italy has refused to discuss Mr Fiori's comments, although bank
officials quoted in the Italian press over the weekend strongly denied
separate allegations by other members of the National Alliance that the
central bank had misused secret funds for promotion and consultancy work.
The National Alliance was criticised by the opposition and by coalition
allies over the weekend. Mr Gianni Letta, chief of staff of Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, came to the defence of the Bank of
Italy, declaring that 'respect for the independence of the central bank is a
sacred and inviolable principle'.
But senior members of the National Alliance denied that the attacks on the
central bank represented a party line, while Mr Fiori's office said the
minister's chief concern was the bank's attitude to the BNC offer.
The Bologna bank has not made a formal bid for BNC, and its directors only
return from holiday today, but bankers say it plans to offer some L380bn
(Pounds 154m) in cash for a majority stake, whereas the San Paolo merger
would be based on an exchange of shares.
Discussion of BNC's future, which began in March, was suspended by the
government earlier this month to allow alternatives to be considered, but Mr
Fiori has accused the central bank of 'incredible behaviour' and trying to
force acceptance of the San Paolo bid with a 'summer holiday blitz'.
Meanwhile, Italy's coalition parties are jockeying for political advantage
ahead of Friday's cabinet meeting, the first since the Bank of Italy was
forced to raise interest rates 10 days ago.

The gap in Sweden between opponents and supporters of the European Union is
narrowing ahead of a referendum on November 13, an opinion poll published
yesterday showed, Reuter reports from Stockholm.
The survey, published in the daily Goteborgs Posten, said support for a No
vote had fallen by four percentage points from the previous poll to 41 per
cent.
Support for Europe remained unchanged at 37 per cent, meaning the difference
between the two camps was only four percentage points, the narrowest gap
since April 1992.
Swedes are becoming more indecisive about whether to join the 12-member
Union. The survey, conducted by the Sifo polling institute, showed the
number of undecided voters had increased to 20 per cent in August from 16
per cent in the previous June poll.
Sweden hopes to join the Union along with Norway, Finland and Austria from
January 1, 1995.

Turning the ambitious aims of the 1992 Rio Earth Summit into reality is the
task facing officials meeting today at the United Nations in Geneva.
Representatives from more than 100 countries will wrestle this week with
curbing global warming, an issue ducked at Rio. The most controversial point
is whether to draw up international targets beyond the year 2000 for curbing
emissions of gases thought to cause global warming.
'Rio was one of the fastest international agreements on the environment that
has ever been reached,' said one observer at the Geneva preparations, 'but
some of the most important issues about how to implement it have been left
until now.'
This summer's heatwave in Europe has renewed interest in the threat of
global warming, which scientists believe may follow a build-up of
'greenhouse' gases such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
Rio's framework convention on climate change, together with a separate
treaty on protecting the diversity of species, were the Earth Summit's most
tangible achievements. But environmental groups such as Greenpeace have
criticised the climate change convention for failing to address emissions
beyond 2000.
Under the convention, industrialised countries have pledged to draw up plans
to bring emissions of 'greenhouse' gases back to 1990 levels in 2000, but
make no commitments beyond that year. UK ministers have warned that UK
emissions are likely to rise sharply after that.
The convention also asks developing countries to improve energy efficiency.
However, there is controversy about how those efforts should be funded.
Signatories have agreed that funding should be channeled through the Global
Environment Facility, a fund administered jointly by the UN and World Bank.
But there is still disagreement over the criteria used to select projects,
and the route through which payments should be made, including whether the
money should be distributed by developing countries' governments.
Officials are under pressure to resolve issues before the UN conference in
Berlin in March.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Archer share orders disclosed: Labour urges trade department
to refer affair to Crown Prosecution Service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Archer gave a stockbroker detailed instructions for the purchase of two
parcels of Anglia Television shares fewer than four working days before MAI
announced a Pounds 292m takeover bid for the television company.
The new details of the Anglia transactions, which have been the focus of a
Department of Trade and Industry investigation into alleged insider trading,
yesterday prompted the Labour party to call on Mr Michael Heseltine, the
trade and industry secretary, to refer the affair to the Crown Prosecution
Service.
Last week, the Financial Times disclosed that Lord Archer's personal orders
to buy Anglia shares were the subject of the five-month DTI investigation.
Mr Heseltine decided at the end of last month not to launch any prosecutions
after the completion of the inquiry. However, Mr Robin Cook, the shadow
trade and industry secretary, yesterday said: 'One Tory politician should
not sit in judgment on another Tory politician.'
He urged Mr Heseltine to refer the case to the CPS for urgent investigation.
The best-selling author and former Conservative party deputy chairman told
the DTI's inspectors that he did not profit from inside information and
never received a penny of the proceeds from the shares transaction.
He has consistently refused to discuss these transactions, on the advice of
his solicitor. However, interviews with officials and stockbrokers familiar
with the case has enabled the FT to reconstruct the events leading to the
DTI inquiry.
The first order from Lord Archer to purchase Anglia shares was placed on
January 13. He telephoned a broker at Charles Stanley, the leading private
client stockbroker, and said he was interested in buying 25,000 Anglia
shares, worth about Pounds 120,000 at the then market price.
Lord Archer had not dealt through Charles Stanley before. However, the
broker was acquainted with Lord Archer and was happy to deal for him.
Daily stock market turnover in Anglia shares at the time was frequently
75,000 shares or less, so this was a sizeable order. The broker said he
would see if he could buy that many shares.
He succeeded and rang Lord Archer back. Though the broker had assumed that
Lord Archer was buying the shares for himself, the novelist then said that
he wanted the shares registered in the name of Mr Broosk Saib, an
acquaintance of his.
According to stockbrokers, it is unusual for one individual to place orders
on behalf of another, unless that other person is a spouse or family member.
However, the broker complied with Lord Archer's wishes, relying on Lord
Archer's bona fides. An account at Charles Stanley was therefore opened for
Mr Saib, with whom the firm has never had any personal contact.
The following day, Friday January 14, Lord Archer rang the broker again and
placed a second order to buy 25,000 shares, once again for the account of Mr
Saib.
However, the address supplied to the broker for all correspondence with Mr
Saib was that of Lord Archer's London penthouse apartment at Alembic House,
which overlooks the River Thames near Vauxhall Bridge.
Lord Archer asked for both parcels of shares to be bought on 'new time
dealing', since January 13 and January 14 were at the end of a stock
exchange account period. This meant that the purchases counted as falling
into the next account period.
New time dealing confers the advantage that the client does not have to pay
for the shares for an additional two weeks. However, the price quoted for
new time dealing by market makers, the wholesalers from which brokers buy
shares, is usually more expensive than the normal price.
In the event, however, no money had to be handed over to pay for the Anglia
shares, because on the following Tuesday, January 18, when MAI launched its
bid, Lord Archer instructed the broker to sell them. The share price soared
180p on that day, netting a profit of Pounds 80,000 on the deal.
Charles Stanley said yesterday it could not comment on the affairs of a
particular client. However, after any sizeable takeover bid is announced,
its senior directors scrutinise dealings by its clients.
At such a meeting following the MAI bid for Anglia, the directors noticed
that the client who had bought the 50,000 Anglia shares, Mr Saib, apparently
had the same address as Lord Archer. They then recalled that Lord Archer's
wife, Mary, is a director of Anglia.
The firm's compliance officer was then instructed to bring these
transactions to the attention of the stock exchange's insider trading group.
Within days, the group had conducted its own preliminary investigation and
passed the results to the DTI.
Meanwhile, Charles Stanley sought advice from the exchange about what to do
with the Pounds 80,000 profit. The firm was instructed to pay it to its
client in the normal way. The firm therefore sent a cheque made out to Mr
Saib to Lord Archer's London address. It has since been cashed through a UK
bank.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Boost for Clinton as House approves crime bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US House of Representatives approved a controversial Dollars 30.2bn
crime bill yesterday , giving much-needed support to the wobbling presidency
of Mr Bill Clinton.
Democrats and moderate Republicans joined forces to approve legislation
which had been years in the making and provides - over six years - almost
Dollars 10bn for prisons, Dollars 8.8bn for police, and Dollars 4.3bn for
'crime prevention' social programmes. It was passed by 235 to 195, with 46
Republicans joining those in favour.
If the bill is passed by the Senate, to which it will be swiftly sent, the
president will have a big victory and, he hopes, momentum as his initiatives
on healthcare and welfare reform come before Congress in the autumn and the
US votes in mid-term congressional elections in November.
Conservative Republicans in the Senate may yet try to block the crime bill
by a filibuster but, now that the House has passed a measure which seems to
have strong support among US voters, such senators could be reluctant to be
seen frustrating it.
Nine days ago prospects looked bleak for Mr Clinton, when the crime bill
failed a procedural vote in the House. The president, his top aides and
congressional Democrats then worked feverishly to bring enough of the
recalcitrant Democrats into line. Five days ago they began rare negotiations
with moderate Republicans, rather than drop a ban on assault weapons, which
might have won the votes of conservative pro-gun Democrats.
To meet the demands of Republican moderates, the Democrats agreed to a
compromise bill which cut Dollars 3.3bn from a Dollars 33.5bn bill and
eliminated and consolidated many of the clauses favoured by liberal
Democrats. The legislation kept the tougher sentencing components, which the
administration had hoped would attract conservatives.
Funds to provide incentives so that local governments can hire 100,000
police - a Clinton campaign promise - were retained, and local governments
were given a greater say on how the funds would be spent.
As House and Senate negotiators laboured on through the weekend, two threats
to the legislation emerged. A rival bill, was introduced by the
conservatives and the gun lobby. It contained no social programmes or ban on
assaults weapons. That was defeated, with 30 Republicans voting against the
measure.
Congress has been trying to pass a significant crime bill for six years.
Past legislation addressing the US crime problem failed to stem the
violence, despite an imprisonment rate that exceeds every other
industrialised country.
This crime bill was supposed to be different because it provided for
prevention programmes, which had bought liberal support; increased funds for
prisons and police; and added a popular gun control measure.
Republicans were torn between a desire to deprive the president of a victory
and reluctance to face their voters next November having opposed a crime
bill. Liberal Democrats wanted a victory for the president and their own
re-election, but were reluctant to vote for a bill tilted towards the harsh
measures which had been ineffective in the past.
Debate was marked by usual partisan excesses, but for a small group in the
centre that called for future bipartisan efforts on the nation's
difficulties.
With polls showing that most Americans consider crime the nation's largest
problem, that sentiment prevailed - for the moment.

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party looked set for victory in
yesterday's presidential and congressional elections, after preliminary
figures from exit polls gave it a comfortable margin over its nearest rival.
Turnout in the election was much higher than expected.
The leftist Party of Democratic Revolution alleged electoral irregularities,
although the centre-right opposition described the process as generally
adequate. Most of the complaints arose from special polling booths, in place
for voters not on the electoral roll or staying outside their home district,
which ran out of ballot papers in the morning.
Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the ruling party's candidate, described himself as 'very
content' with the results of the PRI's own polling. 'I'm happier than I
imagined,' he told foreign correspondents last night.
One exit poll, carried out for Mexico's Chamber of Radio and Television by
the US firm Mitofsky International and Mexican associates, gave Mr Zedillo a
strong lead. According to Mr Mitofsky, preliminary figures gave Mr Zedillo
about 50 per cent support, the centre-right National Action Party about 25
per cent and the leftist Party of Democratic Revolution under 20 per cent.
Pre-electoral polls had indicated a similar outcome.
Preliminary results from polling stations are not expected to be released
until early this morning. Turnout in the election was preliminarily
estimated at about 65 per cent, compared with 48 per cent in the 1988
presidential elections.
The leftist PRD alleged in a statement yesterday that there had been a
series of irregulaties which it believed were committed by 'electoral
alchemists of the ruling party'.
It claimed that electors without credentials had voted, that the ruling
party illegally took supporters to vote several times at different polling
booths and that representatives of their party were expelled from voting
stations.

FT  22 AUG 94 / AT&amp;T acts to fend off telecoms contest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT&amp;T is campaigning to hold back further competition that could
significantly cut prices in the transatlantic telecommunications market.
The move by the largest US telecoms operator comes a month after AT&amp;T was
granted a draft licence to operate in the UK.
AT&amp;T is urging the Federal Communications Commission, the US telecoms
regulator, not to allow a new form of competition called international
simple resale. Under this system, operators lease international lines and
connect them to the public networks on both sides of the Atlantic.
The resale system is expected to bring cuts in transatlantic call prices at
the expense of established carriers, notably AT&amp;T and British
Telecommunications.
As AT&amp;T pursued its case with the US regulator, telecoms analyst Mr Laurence
Heyworth of Robert Fleming, predicted BT would try to pre-empt resale
competition by making 'massive price cuts on international calls' later this
year.
BT has already been told by Oftel, the UK telecoms regulator, that it must
cut charges by about Pounds 400m before the end of the year.
It had been widely assumed that competition on the transatlantic routes
would open up after the UK's decision last month to grant a draft licence to
AT&amp;T. This followed the US regulatory authorities' approval of BT's Dollars
5.3bn (Pounds 3.4bn) alliance with MCI, the second-largest US operator.
The two companies planning to offer the cheap resale services, MFS and ACC,
already have licences to operate in the UK and are asking the Federal
Communications Commission for permission to offer international simple
resale from the US.
AT&amp;T's argument to the US regulator is that 'while the UK has made progress
over the last year' it is still not as open as the US. This is denied by MFS
and ACC, who have told the commission that Britain offers telecoms resale
operators 'opportunities equivalent to those available under US law'. The
resellers' claims are broadly supported by US regional telecoms companies
with substantial UK interests, which have recently put similar claims to the
US regulator.
Through its MCI alliance, BT wants to become the leading international
operator for multinationals. A loss of international business to new
competitors could hamper its ambition.
Mercury, BT's largest UK competitor, stands to be the main loser from a
transatlantic price war. It earns nearly half its income from international
calls.

FT  22 AUG 94 / Court cuts Swiss out of army knife
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Where does the Swiss army knife come from? According to a US appeal court
judgment, the knife of many parts can come from any country, since the words
'Swiss army' describe a type of knife and are not 'location-specific'.
The ruling has angered Swiss producers of the genuine article, who are under
attack from cheap red Chinese imitations and claim that there has been
trespassing on their intellectual property.
'The Americans make such a fuss about protecting consumers and intellectual
property rights, and then they do this. We were very upset,' said Maurice
Cachot, chief executive of Wenger, one of the two companies approved to
supply the pocket knives to the Swiss army.
To some extent, even the knives made in Switzerland for consumer markets are
not the real thing. The Swiss army, which first commissioned the production
of knives for the troops in 1886, specifies no paint on the aluminium cover
of the models it buys. Cork screws are not allowed either.
Wenger and Victorinox, the other Swiss maker, say that they are not
particularly worried about competition from the cheap Chinese imitations -
even though the imitations sell for one-fifth or less of the price and
outsell the Swiss products in the US by nearly three to one.
The Swiss makers say the Chinese knives are obviously of inferior quality.
The US appeals court agrees, describing them as 'inexpensive and shoddy'.
The Swiss makers' deeper concern is that the judgment is a licence to
precision manufacturers in Japan, Germany, Britain and other industrialised
countries, which could make a better job of imitating the Swiss article.
Also, there is the issue of consumer information. According to a survey
commissioned by the Swiss makers, more than half of Americans believe that
when they buy a red, multi-gadget pocket knife they are buying a Swiss
product.
And that was even before the Chinese set alarms ringing in the Alps two
years ago by painting the Swiss white cross symbol and the words 'Swiss
army' on their exports to the US.
The Swiss and their US distributors responded quickly to this cheeky
challenge with a lawsuit in September 1992, accusing Arrow Trading, the US
distributor for the Chinese, of qualitatively and geographically false
advertising. They also won an injunction prohibiting Arrow from using the
words 'Swiss army' and the cross symbol until the case was decided.
A year later, they won their case, but lost on appeal last month. In a
judgment the court said the term 'Swiss army' was not location-specific. But
it added that Arrow's conduct in promoting its knives might be misleading
and so it ordered a new hearing to resolve that issue.
The court also lifted the injunction against Arrow using the Swiss army name
and cross.
'We are confident that we will win,' Mr Cachot said. But he also said they
expected to win the appeal.

The performance was underpinned by active construction and cement demand and
last year's acquisition of Semen Nusantara. Net sales jumped almost 75 per

'The results reflect the early benefits of the consolidated marketing and

Semen Cibinong bought Nusantara in July last year. It is the only cement

FT  20 AUG 94 / India completes key reform of currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Indian rupee will today become convertible in all current account
transactions, in a further easing of currency regulations announced
yesterday by India's central bank.
The move will give India Article VIII status in the International Monetary
Fund, which is a fundamental indicator of 'good standing' in the fund.
The change is an important part of the liberalisation programme of Prime
Minister P V Narasimha Rao's government. It also marks a significant change
both for Indians and for international investors.
Although India introduced convertibility on its trade account in March 1993,
benefiting exporters and importers of goods, Indians have continued to
experience severe restrictions on travel and the purchase of most foreign
services. Equally, investors have been constrained in the repatriation of
dividend and interest income.
Indian citizens travelling abroad for personal reasons were allowed only
Dollars 2,000 (Pounds 1,300) a year, and all Indians had to get permission
from the Reserve (central) Bank to buy foreign exchange for business travel,
medical treatment or studies abroad.
With yesterday's decision to extend convertibility to the entire current
account, these restrictions have been lifted and the Reserve Bank has
delegated powers to authorised dealers to release foreign exchange to Indian
citizens.
The bank has set nominal limits on the release of foreign exchange, but
yesterday emphasised that bona fide requests for additional exchange
facilities would be cleared.
Non-resident Indians will also now be able to repatriate earnings from
investments in India, including the interest accrued on previously
non-repatriable rupee deposit schemes for expatriate Indians, which will be
eligible for repatriation from the quarter beginning October 1 1994. The
principal amount of these deposits will remain non-repatriable, but no fresh
deposits will be accepted from today.
The bank said income on investment by non-resident Indians would be
repatriable in a phased manner over a three-year period. Up to Dollars 1,000
would be remittable in 1994-1995. On amounts exceeding Dollars 1,000,
one-third of the annual income earned during 1994-1995 would be remittable,
two-thirds in 1995-1996, and the entire income from 1996-1997.
In general, restrictions on capital transactions remain. But 'India has
taken one more giant step towards full convertibility of the rupee on the
capital account', said a Finance Ministry official, although he emphasised
that that was still at least two years away.
'The finance minister (Mr Manmohan Singh) has kept the promise he made in
his budget speech that the rupee would be fully convertible on the current
account before the year was out,' he said.
The improvement in India's balance of payments, with the current account
deficit declining from Dollars 10bn in 1990-1991 to Dollars 0.8bn in
1993-1994, and a rise in foreign exchange reserves to Dollars 21.4bn from
just Dollars 1.1bn in June 1991, have allowed the Reserve Bank to relax the
foreign exchange restrictions.
These improvements have been brought about by an export recovery, the
decline of non-oil imports, foreign investment in stock markets and the
raising of funds through Euro-issues.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Getty Museum in Malibu, California, said last night that it had
threatened legal action against the British government in the row over 'The
Three Graces'.
Mr John Walsh, director of the museum, said he had written a 'forceful'
letter to Mr Stephen Dorrell, heritage secretary, complaining about his
refusal to grant an export licence for the sculpture.
Mr Walsh said: 'At every turn in this sorry saga, our efforts to acquire the
statue and to exhibit it to the public have been frustrated by the delays in
and working of the export licence system in this case.'
The National Heritage Department said last night: 'If the matter goes to
court we will defend our position vigorously.'
'The Three Graces' was sold in 1989 after the Victoria and Albert museum in
London said the Pounds 1m price was too high. Since being bought by the
Getty Museum last year the statue has been awaiting an export licence.
The museum is seeking to take the sculpture to California but Mr Dorrell
deferred the application earlier this month.
British museums are battling to raise Pounds 7.6m to keep the statue in this
country, assisted by a pledge of Pounds 1m by Mr John Paul Getty, son of the
museum's founder.

The leading citizens' group monitoring tomorrow's presidential election in

yesterday. But the report recognised advances in electoral conditions which
opened the possibiliity that the election result could be 'relatively
credible'.
The ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) goes into the election as
strong favourite. But Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the leftist opposition
warned in yesterday's La Jornada there would be 'confrontation' if the
elections were not clean. Some government officials say they are concerned
Mr Cardenas may denounce the election as fraudulent before voting has ended.
The Civic Alliance's main criticisms fall into three categories: media bias,
campaign financing, and unpunished violations of electoral laws.
'The bias of the media is without doubt one of the largest obstacles to the
credibility of the electoral process,' the report concludes.
Campaign finance rules had been changed but were still inadequate. This 'was
one of the most important aspects of the electoral campaign', yet it was
impossible to make an independent evaluation of campaign spending 'because
there are no mechanisms to determine how much each party spends'. The PRI
has massively outspent its rivals.
The group's concerns over the lack of enforcement of the electoral laws have
been echoed by Mexico's independent election magistrates, who have sharply
criticised the government for dragging its feet in implementing key aspects
of the new electoral law.
The magistrates, who were approved by all the political parties and have a
controlling vote on the board of the Federal Electoral Institute, have
publicly attacked the Attorney-General's office for not giving more support
to the special prosecutor for electoral crimes. The prosecutor has fully
resolved only one case.
'It is unthinkable that the prosecutor does not have his budget,' said Mr
Santiago Creel, one of the six magistrates. 'This is undermining confidence
in the system.' The Interior Ministry responded to the criticisms by
promising all allegations would continue to be dealt with after the election
and by increasing resources available to the prosecutor's office.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Short-term bid to solve old problem: Clinton move to stop
Cuban refugees risks repeating Haiti policy failure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Two years ago, when he was still a candidate for the White House, President
Bill Clinton backed the Cuba Democracy Act which toughened the US embargo
against the government of President Fidel Castro.
Today, the embargo has done its work, greatly abetted by the disappearance
of the Soviet Union as an economic support. But the immediate consequence -
a stream of refugees crossing the Straits of Florida on precarious rafts -
is not to the Clinton administration's liking.
The memory of President Jimmy Carter, helpless before the Mariel Boatlift of
1980, is still a painful one for many Democrats. Mr Clinton appears
determined not to be caught in the same trap.
'We have gone through that once. . . It was wrong then and it's wrong now,
and I'm not going to let it happen again,' Mr Clinton said yesterday at a
news conference to explain the new refugee policy.
The new policy places Cubans essentially on a par with their Caribbean
neighbours in Haiti: they may apply for legal immigration status inside
their own country, but if they strike out on their own across the sea, they
will be put in a detention camp.
That causes wry satisfaction to some who have been arguing for refugee
status for Haitians. In terms of beatings and killings, there is a much
clearer case for political repression in Haiti than there is in Cuba.
'This parity would never have been achieved were it not for Castro,' said Mr
Larry Birns of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a Washington policy
group.
Unlike the Haitians, however, the Cubans are protected by the 1966 Cuban
Adjustment Act from being deported back to their home country.
But Mr Clinton has already learnt how difficult it is to frame a policy to
deal with the Haitian boat people. He has changed tune repeatedly, and still
had little success in stemming the exodus.
There is little likelihood that the new policy will have any greater success
at stopping Cuban emigration than it has been at stopping Haitian
emigration.
Ms Janet Reno, who as attorney general has overall responsibility for the
immigration services, argued yesterday that the US must not allow Mr Castro
a safety valve for his economic and political troubles.
'The problems of Cuba have got to be solved there by democratic reform, and
we must not let this be used as a safety valve to keep the pressure off
him,' she said.
But she acknowledged that the new policy was only a short-term palliative,
and admitted that it had not yet even been decided what would be done with
the detainees.
Because the Cuban Adjustment Act prevents repatriation, Cubans who reach the
US and are placed in detention camps will eventually have to be given some
kind of asylum, unless another country can be persuaded to take them in or
unless the administration is willing to contemplate long-term internment.
'We'll address those issues down the line. The most important point right
now is not to play into Castro's game,' Ms Reno said. She fervently hopes
that Cubans will remember that they can apply for political asylum at the US
mission in Havana, as around 3,000 people a year do successfully.
For the time being, the Pentagon is busily setting up tents for around
10,000 at Guantanamo, the US military enclave on the coast of Cuba, on top
of the 14,700 Haitians who are already there. Guantanamo should at least
shorten the journey for some Cuban emigrants. The camp perimeter is still
mined, so Cubans cannot simply walk through the gates, but senior defence
officials said they will be taken in if they swim around the point and into
Guantanamo harbour.
That leaves US policy towards Cuba pulling in contradictory directions. The
embargo is intended to bring the Castro government to its knees, but the
fear of a flood of refugees leaves some wishing it had been less effective.
Could the refugee crisis reach such proportions that the US is obliged to
reconsider its visceral loathing of Mr Castro, and embark on a policy
somewhat closer to constructive engagement as a way of opening up Cuba to
democracy and free markets?
'If the US can have a dialogue with North Korea and Vietnam, why not talk to
Castro?' wonders Mr Birns.
Such a switch would, however, be difficult. Doubts have been raised in
recent years over whether the fiercely anti-Castro Cuban American National
Foundation speaks for the entire Cuban-American community, but it remains
the loudest and most politically effective voice.
Nor is it likely that the Republican opposition, or even most of Mr
Clinton's own Democratic party, would welcome such a shift.
In the meantime, however, Mr Clinton is left to confront Mr Castro with much
the same general policy with which he faces the military leaders in Haiti:
watching, and hoping that they will go away of their own accord.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Insurers told to pay out Dollars 1bn refunds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The California Supreme Court has ruled that insurance companies must pay
rebates, expected to top Dollars 1bn (Pounds 645m), to millions of car and
home insurance policyholders in the state.
The ruling appears to end six years of legal wrangling between the state and
the insurance industry over the constitutionality of Proposition 103, an
insurance reform initiative approved by voters in 1988. The initiative
called for insurance companies to lower their premiums and submit to a
state-regulated system for approving rate increases.
The court unanimously ruled that a formula for calculating property and
casualty rate reductions devised by Mr John Garamendi, the state insurance
commissioner, does not violate the constitutional rights of insurance
companies.
The court also said that the state had the right to impose a 10 per cent
profit ceiling on the entire insurance industry.
The ruling was on a test case involving 20th Century Insurance of Los
Angeles, which may now be required to make refunds totalling Dollars 119m.
Mr Garamendi said that the ruling granted him the power to immediately order
insurance companies to pay rebates of about Dollars 1bn. It also affirmed
his authority to adopt industry-wide regulations to prevent excessive rate
increases.
A total of 35 insurance companies have already issued refunds totalling
about Dollars 800m, the insurance commission said. However, two of the
largest insurers in California, State Farm Insurance and the Farmers
Insurance Group, have yet to pay any refunds.
State Farm owes Dollars 436m in rebates, according to the state's insurance
department.
However, Farmers Insurance, part of the BAT group, said that it had not
received an order to make rebates from the state insurance commissioner and
was confident its rates were fair. 'We do not believe that we will have to
issue rebates,' a spokesman said.
But state officials are expected to move quickly to issue rebate orders
following the state supreme court decision.
'The State Supreme Court's decision is a landmark victory for the people of
California,' Mr Garamendi said. 'The court's ruling allows us to order
outstanding rebates paid to consumers who have waited six years for them,
and enables us to proceed with implementing safeguards from rising insurance
rates in the future.'
Meanwhile, insurance industry officials said that some companies were now
reviewing other options, including ceasing to offer property and casualty
insurance in California.
'Basically, the court is saying that insurance companies are not welcome in
this state,' said the Personal Insurance Federation, an industry trade
group.

Mrs Chandrika Kumaratunga, sworn in as prime minister of Sri Lanka yesterday
after winning this week's general election, pledged to try to end the civil
war in the north of the island, where government troops are fighting
separatist Tamil Tiger guerrillas, Stefan Wagstyl writes from Colombo.
She plans to approach the Tigers and other groups to discuss a settlement of
the fighting, which has claimed over 30,000 lives in the last 17 years. 'We
have to tread very carefully, but we intend to start on a solution soon,'
she said.
Mrs Kumaratunga, who is to keep the finance portfolio for herself, also
promised to follow free market policies with 'the private sector as the main
motor' of the economy. She wished to assuage fears that her People's
Alliance, a centre-left coalition which has ended 17 years of conservative
rule, might favour greater intervention in the economy. Her other priorities
were constitutional reform, including curbing the powers of the executive
president, and a drive against corruption.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Virgin-Delta airline pact blocked by US disapproval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A planned transatlantic alliance between Virgin Atlantic Airways of the UK
and Delta Air Lines of the US was yesterday effectively shelved following a
decision by the US Department of Transportation to withhold its approval.
The deal was supposed to come into effect on November 1, but Delta and
Virgin said they had postponed implementation indefinitely because the
department was not prepared to act in advance of negotiations on a fresh
aviation treaty between the US and the UK.
Under the existing aviation treaty, only two US airlines - United and
American - are allowed to fly into London Heathrow airport, the world's
largest. The US has been pushing the UK to give all US airlines access to
Heathrow.
The agreement between Delta and Virgin would have given Delta a different
form of access to Heathrow by allowing it to book blocks of 15 to 20 per
cent of the seats on Virgin's flights to London from New York, Newark, Los
Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, Orlando and Boston.
Delta would have independently sold tickets for these seats as though they
were tickets for its own flights, using Delta flight codes. Both airlines
hoped to benefit from the deal through big increases in passenger numbers.
The UK government was in favour of the pact and approved it at the end of
May. The US Justice Department approved it a month later. But the US
Department of Transportation has been unimpressed by UK offers to improve
access to UK regional airports and London Stansted as part of a
liberalisation package, and is demanding bigger concessions.
Delta and Virgin said they still hoped to go ahead with the deal eventually,
and they still planned to implement those parts of it that did not require
government approval. This means the two will share frequent-flyer
programmes, and Virgin will start using Delta's ground facilities at US
airports.
Mr Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic, said both airlines were
'deeply disappointed' that the code-sharing agreement had been delayed. He
could not see the logic of approving an earlier code-sharing deal between
USAir and British Airways while delaying a decision over the Virgin/Delta
pact.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Truth of the Matter: Cheeky and misunderstood - Michael
Holman reflects on what boyhood experience taught him about Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was generally agreed that 'Smiler' May knew how to manage Natives.
Whenever his boy got drunk, he gave him a sound thrashing, behind the kia,
the servants' quarters at the end of the garden.
I used to like Smiler. He was as cheerful as his nickname suggested, and
popular, judging by the turn out for the sun-downers he hosted, the round of
drinks at the end of hot African days.
It was at one such evening that I changed my mind about him. As dusk fell on
Victory Street, Gwelo, a small conservative town in the heart of Southern
Rhodesia, Smiler's neighbours had gathered on his stoep (verandah), drinks
in hand, while children roamed the surrounding gardens.
That evening, however, I lingered in the half-shadows near the stoep, a
12-year-old eavesdropper on conversations that turned to the trials and
tribulations of domestic servants. All agreed on one thing: Smiler knew how
to handle his boy. I cannot recall the 'boy's' name. He was in fact an
adult, the family's cook of many years standing. The relationship owed much,
I heard Smiler explain, to those regular sessions behind the kia. They took
place when Joseph (as I shall call him) was drunk. No one was more
appreciative, apparently, of this vigorous display of concern for his
welfare than Joseph himself. But one thing bothered Smiler: something in
Joseph's expression. At the end of the thrashing, the boy was still
'cheeky'.
Smiler did not need to say more. It was the mid-1950s, a time when the
African nationalist movement throughout the continent was starting to flex
its muscles, the word was resonant with dissent and potential rebellion.
Joseph's passive resistance was no doubt inspired by his conviction that
white minority rule would pass. And so it proved, some 25 years later, when
Rhodesia became Zimbabwe.
Today, nearly 40 years on, that evening in Gwelo comes to mind. As Africa's
post-independence crisis deepens, some voices call for Africa to be left to
its own devices; others advocate trusteeship status for nations in distress.
But what we offer Africa - indeed, seek to impose on the continent - is an
economic system and a political culture for which its peoples show little
affinity.
It is as if Africa has been collectively taken behind the kia by the west,
and given a thrashing by the World Bank and the IMF, the well- intentioned
Smiler Mays of today.
Grunts of pain, and a series of exhortations, reach our ears as the virtues
of structural adjustment and multi-party democracy are hammered home. With a
cuff comes the demand: 'Devalue]' And a further clout: 'Privatise]', and
then a punch: 'Reduce the budget deficit]'
Ten years after the thrashing began, Africa emerges from behind the kia,
battered and bemused, but still cheeky.
It is if Africa clings to an atavistic sense of what should be, and what
might yet be. It never accepted communism, and while capitalism has
triumphed elsewhere, it has yet to win over hearts and minds in Africa.
It is as if the continent dimly recalls an era long past, well before the
slave trade, colonialism and the cold war, which between them traumatised
the region. Traces of this era can still be detected, like Great Zimbabwe,
the ruins of a once mighty city, testimony to a great indigenous
civilisation, its rise and fall shrouded in mystery.
Africa sustains a belief in the extended family, respect for the elderly,
hospitality towards strangers, and a passion for dance and music, laughter
and physical embrace which makes the west seem soul-less.
There also survives a culture of compassion and tolerance, reconciliation
after Biafra, or the forgiveness of their erstwhile jailers by the
Kenyattas, the Mugabes and Nelson Mandela.
It is as if Africa is saying that these values, and more besides, are
incompatible with capitalism. Yet it fails to articulate an economic or
constitutional alternative to the systems it rejects, based on values Africa
finds alien.
So Africa stubbornly, doggedly resists, as it pursues a vision based on the
past. Africa has rejected our embrace and shrugs off our thrashing, but like
Smiler May, we are only aware that Africa, like Joseph, is defiantly
'cheeky'.

FT  20 AUG 94 / The lost art of the grovel: Dominic Lawson was highly
impressed by Timothy Clifford's abject apology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was suggested in this column last week that the government's peculiar
inability to reap political rewards from the economic good harvest was the
result of not saying sorry. Specifically, it had pretended that it was
wholly responsible for the transformation in our fortunes which followed on
its involuntary exit from the exchange rate mechanism.
The British people could see that this was, at best, bare-faced cheek. We
resented the complete lack of contrition for the hundreds of thousands of
jobs lost because of the previous policy.
Now, within days of advancing this theory, the extraordinary power of a good
old fashioned apology has been made manifest. Yesterday it was revealed that
John Paul Getty II, the British-resident American philanthropist had
confirmed his offer to donate Pounds 1m towards the fund to keep Canova's
Three Graces in Britain, rather than have it bought by the Getty museum,
established by his late father.
Two days earlier it seemed that Getty might withdraw his offer, after
Timothy Clifford, the director of the National Galleries of Scotland,
claimed on television that his kind offer was in fact motivated by a grudge
against his father.
'I think Mr Getty never got on at all well with his father. That is the
crucial point of it,' said Clifford, with an astonishing mixture of
presumption, impertinence, and foolishness.
The Times then published a letter in which Getty was reported as saying:
'The only way I can see to disprove the allegation is to withdraw my offer
and do everything I can to see the Getty (museum) gets it. This I propose to
do, unless you have any suggestions.'
Clifford had a suggestion all right. He apologised. He apologised epically.
He apologised in industrial quantities. He apologised to any newspaper which
would listen. He apologised in television studios, from morning to night. As
the Daily Telegraph remarked, 'not since Priam abased himself before
Achilles to secure the return of the body of his son Hector, has there been
an example of grovelling so profuse and spectacular.'
But the point was that Clifford, unlike the Conservative Party, has ended up
with a smile on his face, (if it could be seen under such a large
accumulation of egg). Getty, after such a gratifying barrage of apologies,
relented. It looks as though Canova's Three Graces - or rather Canova's copy
of his original, for that is what it is - will remain in Britain. And
Clifford - unlike Norman 'je ne regrette rien' Lamont - has kept his job, if
not his self-esteem.
It may be objected that such apologies as Clifford's are not motivated by a
sense of shame, but rather by a sense of self-preservation, or some other
ulterior motive. But that would miss the point.
An old-fashioned apology is social in its context: it is a way of letting
the wider society know that the normal bounds of behaviour have been
broached and that the breach has been acknowledged. That is why one
apologises after one has belched in public.
Unfortunately the great rise in the number of libel cases, and I suspect in
the prestige of libel lawyers - George Carman QC is the man for our times -
shows how far the prompt apology has gone out of fashion. Newspapers, more
than ever, shun the immediate retraction as an unendurable embarrassment,
and instead are prepared to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds of their
shareholders' money in the hope that the plaintiff will run out of either
patience or money, or both. And yet I have never come across a reader who
thinks less of his newspaper for publishing a speedy retraction.
So while Timothy Clifford is currently the laughing stock of the art world,
I have some hopes that his timely practice of the ancient and almost
forgotten art of crawling will encourage those with real power over our
affairs to rediscover the pragmatic merits of humility.

FT  20 AUG 94 / As They Say in Europe: A tale of hits and myths - James
Morgan on how the Jackal brought joy to editors' hearts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You could feel the sense of relief. At last, the papers could ring the
changes on the exhausting, grim stories that had dominated their news pages
for so long. The arrest of Carlos the Jackal brought joy to every editor's
heart.
No matter that the man handed over by Sudan to the French was a bit of a
bungler. No matter that his last escapade took place years before the end of
communism. He was still the person remembered as the incarnation of
international terrorism.
The Frankfurter Rundschau said Carlos had moved through the international
terrorist infrastructure in his earlier career like 'a fish through water'.
But 1989 had created 'greater international transparency' which made it more
difficult for him to hide behind 'progressive' regimes.
The word that cropped up most often was 'myth' and the other Frankfurt
daily, the Allgemeine Zeitung, made the most of the theme: 'A myth that has
been detained is a myth no longer. That is the most important thing about
the arrest of . . . Carlos.' (This might not be true: the detention of
Napoleon probably enhanced the Bonapartist myth. One remembers the
supposedly tragic, brooding figure on St Helena.)
Madrid's El Pais called Carlos names which it might have eschewed had he
been at large and at the top of his form. He was the 'joker of terror' and
'an armed dilettante'. But it, too, subscribed to the myth theory of the
international killer; anybody who behaves like something out of a cheap
paperback gains an aura of romance.
In France itself, Le Figaro made its editorial a manifesto for the tough
interior minister, Charles Pasqua. 'Every time he has had the job, he has
pulled off a spectacular coup. He has now become kingmaker among the
Gaullist contenders for the presidency in the election early next year.'
Liberation reported that Sudan had been paid off with satellite pictures of
the (Christian) rebels in the south of the country that enabled the
(Islamic) government to wipe them out. Pasqua has made his name at home as
the hammer of fundamentalist terrorism but, if Liberation is right, he is
somewhat more flexible abroad.
The Carlos story is one that reflects the continuing division of Europe.
Although it was the east that provided his sanctuary for so long, Carlos is
not well known there. His activities were hardly the stuff of news in the
communist media; thus, his arrest had only a modest impact east of the Oder.
Indeed, the Leipziger Volkszeitung managed to be wrong and banal in
successive sentences: 'With the arrest of Carlos, a successful blow has been
delivered against the nerve centre of international terrorism. But the world
is still not safe from terrorist attacks.'
Elsewhere in the former communist world, reports were straightforward, even
dull. So, a commentary in the Prague daily Mlada Fronta Dnes seemed, at
first, surprising. 'Justice has finally caught up with at least some of
those who, in their time, mercilessly liquidated the class enemy,' it began.
This, however, turned out to have nothing to do with Carlos but, rather,
with charges against a 'former torturer' once employed in political prisons
in Bohemia. The paper added: 'Bringing the perpetrators of communist
brutalities to court is a more genuine contribution to the de-communisation
of society than any well-meant but empty ideological appeal.' By comparison,
the trial of Carlos will be virtually meaningless.
In eastern Europe, the retired terrorist is not some glamorous figure in an
exotic capital but the civil servant next door. In spite of its local
preoccupations, the Interior Ministry in Prague rummaged through its
predecessor's archives and revealed the less-than-glamorous truth about
Carlos.
The Czech news agency reported that the records showed Carlos visited Prague
frequently from 1978 to 1986 on a South Yemen diplomatic passport. But all
governments in the region were getting fed up with him and, gradually, he
fell out of favour. They accepted him, only to pass him on as soon as
possible to an ally.
Being a myth, it seems, was not really all that much fun.

FT  20 AUG 94 / In search of the drinkers' thinker: Christian Tyler follows
a trail of bottles from Yorkshire to Languedoc as he tries to unravel the
mystery of the extraordinary Doctor Rabelais
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alcofribas Nasier: even his anagrammatical nom de plume has the smell of
drink about it. But there was a time, and there are still some places, where
Francois Rabelais was better known for thinking than for drinking. As the
sober-suited director of the Montpellier public library, Gilles Gudin de
Vallerin, said: 'The word 'rabelaisian' just does not suit him.'
The 500th anniversary of the birth of the author of Gargantua and Pantagruel
is being celebrated all over France - mischievously, because it is the
second such celebration in a decade. But French wine-growers, tourist
officers, politicians, visiting bibbers and buyers care little for the
latest scholarly consensus which says Rabelais was born in 1484, not 1494.
Their attitude is, as Rabelais might have said: 'You open the books; we'll
open the bottles.'
The pilgrim's path to the real Doctor Rabelais is littered with bottles.
This pilgrim's journey was launched during a convivial winter evening, from
a stone farmhouse at the top of a Yorkshire dale. Hanging on the wall was an
engraving of an equivalent stone farmhouse, La Deviniere, ('the soothsayer')
near Chinon in Touraine, the reputed place of Rabelais' birth.
La Deviniere stands on the upper slope of a wide and open valley,
overlooking fields of sunflowers and melons. The farmhouse bedroom is
reached by an outside stair under its own grey slate roof. In the corner is
a four-poster bed, hung in jute and linen drugget. Around the panelled walls
are illustrations by artists over the centuries of the five books of
Gargantua and Pantagruel; there is a piano score by Erik Satie and an
original Matisse sketch.
But the putative birthplace of Rabelais is overwhelmed - undermined, one
should say - by the magnificent rustic cellars below the house where wine
presses and other agricultural impedimenta have been set out in honour of
the secular saint of the vine. On their way out visitors are offered the
chance to buy a magnum of the local red. The label says 'Gargantua'.
A kilometre or so down the road sits the abbey of Seuilly where Rabelais and
his brothers may have been sent to school by their father, a Chinon notary
(or apothecary, or inn-keeper). It is also the place where, in the first
book, Friar John first appears defending the abbey close against the forces
of the King of Lerne. The abbey is closed now, and used as a conference
centre. But today someone had been busy: in the garden behind lay an immense
quill pen, 17 metres long, made of plywood, its white paint drying in the
sun. It was plainly the plume of Gargantua.
As his birthplace shows, Francois Rabelais was not a gentleman. But he was
certainly a scholar. Enrolled as a monk into the Franciscan order he
transferred to the more benign, modern regime of the Benedictines of
Maillezais where he set himself to learn Greek, then considered a shocking,
pagan language.
In early middle age, after a tour of the universities and a spell in Paris
learning to despise the medieval orthodoxy of the Sorbonne, he threw off his
monk's habit and descended on Montpellier in 1530 to enrol in the famous
medical school. It was one of the few places in Europe licensed to practise
the new art of anatomical dissection, or equipped to deal with the repulsive
consequences (as the present anatomical museum reminds us) of the new
plague: syphilis. Here in Montpellier the modern pilgrim was able to catch
up with him, thanks to a hazy organisation called Les Rencontres de
Dionysos, the creation of a whirling dervish of an Irish literary tippler,
Dr Redmond O'Hanlon, of University College, Dublin.
By means of a cunning combination of brain-work with gullet-work. O'Hanlon
had tempted a clutch of Rabelais specialists from France, England and the US
to a seminar called Rabelais et Dionysos; vin, carnaval, ivresse at the Paul
Valery university. The days were to be devoted to academic debate, the
nights to slaking the throat in the company of a succession of grateful but
bemused wine-growers in the surrounding hills of the Languedoc.
Evidence of Dr Rabelais' own reputation for extraordinary scholarship came
quickly to hand. Outside Montpellier, stands the beautiful Chateau de
Flaugergues owned by the viticulturist Count Henri de Colbert. Among the
16th and 17th century vellum-bound books in his library is a two-volume
history of Montpellier by a family ancestor, Charles Degrefeuille, published
in 1739. It contains the story of Rabelais' encounter with a certain
chancellor Duprat who was attacking the medical school's privileges.
According to legend, Rabelais opened his petition by addressing the
chancellor's secretary in Latin. When the secretary called a Latin
interpreter, Rabelais spoke to him in Greek. A Greek-speaker was summoned.
The doctor switched to Hebrew. A professor of Hebrew was unearthed and
Rabelais addressed him in Arabic. Finally, with a speech in Syriac - a form
of Aramaic used by some eastern churches - the doctor clinched the contest.
On hearing the story the chancellor was charmed and the privileges restored.
For this feat, Rabelais' portrait was placed in the hall of the school and
his doctor's robes thenceforward placed round the shoulders of each
graduate.
Rabelais took his medical degree within months of arriving in Montpellier
and went to practise at the Hotel Dieu hospital in Lyons, then the
intellectual capital of France. There he fathered a son, Theodule, and a
book Pantagruel. It was the beginning of his gross, great satire against
medieval, monkish scholasticism and hymn to the intellectual and sensual
liberation of Renaissance Man.
'Beuvez tousjours, ne mourrez jamais.' Was Rabelais drunk when he wrote?
Modern scholars say there is no evidence for it. Was he a boozer? If so, he
could hardly have held the post of doctor at Lyons or, later, as secretary
on important ambassadorial missions to Rome. But anyway, what constituted a
boozer in 16th century France?
Rabelais' prose, scholarly and vulgar, defined French as Chaucer's had
defined English, and poured out just at the moment when the printing press
was spreading. His heirs include Sterne and the modern French writer Georges
Perec - but above all James Joyce (though some find Joyce's wordplay anaemic
by comparison).
'People who love Rabelais with all their heart read him as if he'd written
the day before yesterday,' said Jean-Paul Sartre. The English novelist John
Cowper Powys called him the sanest of all great writers - and perhaps the
only sane one.
Over the years, Rabelais' work has been mined by marxists,
deconstructionists and other ideologues and mystics. Today, according to Dr
Richard Cooper of Oxford, there is no real controversy left. His fellow
participants in the Rabelais revels agreed that beneath the punning, insults
and obscenity, the doctor has a humanist message to convey - which is partly
why his books were condemned and censored.
That does not mean, however, that the academic playground has been entirely
stripped of rides. Prof Francois Rigolot of Princeton University kicked off
with a happy hour's discourse on rhetoric and ambiguity, taking as his text
Friar John's pun in Book I: service divin, service du vin.
Marie-Madeleine Fragonard, a professor from Montpellier, talked about
obscenity in the Renaissance. She explained how con might be traced back to
the Greek kuon (dog) and reappear in the German konig, and how the syllables
'cu' and 'ul' had ancient symbolic meanings, as shown by the names of
mythological heroes such as Mercury, Hercules and Bacchus.
Dr Carol Clark analysed the infant education of the giant Gargantua. What
was meant by the episode in which the ladies of Grand-gousier's court
squabble over the baby's enormous, inquisitive member? It was, she
suggested, from their eloquent banter that the infant was learning the
rhetorical style of a Renaissance prince. Once he was transferred to the
instruction of men Gargantua grew into a silent, hesitant adult.
For flights of Rabelaisian fancy there was none to match the gaunt and
passionate figure of Claude Gaignebet, an anthropologist from Nice.
Black-haired, grey-bearded and wild-eyed, with a battered volume of the
masterwork under his arm, Gaignebet is the last survivor of that school
which regards the five books as arcana, as riddles to be unpicked. His
device is to manipulate the calendar to expose the keys and clues to what he
says is the doctor's real persona, that of latter-day evangelist who reveals
the true history of the Christian religion. Gaignebet, with his immense
knowledge and exotic views, sometimes amuses, sometimes charms - and often
frightens - more orthodox experts.
Whatever Rabelais' true purpose, it is plain that he has been swallowed and
regurgitated by the voracious characters he created. It is his own fault.
Commercial lobbies shamelessly invoke the name of Rabelais (there are discos
and cafes named after him) yet it is the character of Gargantua that they
are celebrating.
When Jacques Blanc, president of the Languedoc-Roussillon region, stood
before the wine-growers of the Mediterranean in Narbonne and declared that
wine does not lead to alcoholism, merely to an ivresse of the heart and the
passions, he was talking in truly Rabelaisian fashion. But the scene before
him was gargantuan: 500 diners, already gorged on oysters and sparkling
wine, facing fresh fistfuls of cutlery, with seven glasses apiece waiting to
be filled, roaring their approval while teams of vignerons paraded on stage
in their medieval gowns to receive trophies in the shape of Silenus, the
goatish mythical father of Bacchus.
A few miles away stands the most eloquent memorial of all to the spirit of
Rabelais the devout, divine libertarian. Valmagne is a well-preserved gothic
abbey church of 1257, as high as the cathedral of Notre-Dame from which
Gargantua stole the bells. The monastery was confiscated from the
Cistercians at the time of the French Revolution and passed into private
hands. Apart from a statue of the Madonna holding a headless child and a
cross made of twisted vine root, the church has been stripped of devotional
trappings. In each bay that formerly housed a side-altar, stands a
40,000-litre wine barrel. There are 18 of these oak tuns in all for storing
the output of the vineyard. The empty church is cool but airy, the perfect
temperature. Service divin has become service du vin.
Rabelais, lawyer, doctor and writer died as a parish priest in Paris in
1553. He prescribed only one rule for his utopian (and co-educational)
monastery, the 9,332-room Abbey of Theleme which Gargantua built for the
heroic Friar John. It was: Do What Thou Wilt.
His instruction has been faithfully followed in this second-time-around
anniversary year. But who is to complain? Only, perhaps, those who are tired
of hearing the words 'rabelaisian' and 'gargantuan'. For there is another
adjective, one by which Rabelais better deserves to be remembered. It
denotes wisdom, generosity, curiosity, spontaneity, hospitality and
humanity. The word is pantagrueliste.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Arts: Pop memorabilia comes of age - Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every year somebody discovers a 'lost' Raphael, or a previously unknown El
Greco, and the fine art world goes gooey-eyed. Next month Sotheby's sells
the pop world's equivalent, a recording of John Lennon fronting his first
band, the Quarrymen, in a church hall on a wet night in Liverpool in 1957.
Sixteen-year-old Bob Molyneux, a recording fanatic, taped an instantly
recognisable Lennon screeching out two songs, one of them the hit of the
day, Lonnie Donnegan's 'Puttin' on the style'. By chance he never got round
to taping over the event, and as Lennon, as a Beatle, quickly became famous,
Molyneux realised he had a potential gem and stored the recording in a bank
vault. It should make him up to Pounds 150,000 richer on September 15.
Pop memorabilia, for long a disparaged sector of the auction market, is
coming of age. The first sale was held by Sotheby's in 1981 and raised
Pounds 50,000. Next month's auction should comfortably top Pounds 1m. Prices
have hiccuped on occasion, especially when the Japanese temporarily
abandoned the market, but in the main they have avoided the convulsions
which have hit more outwardly respectable sectors, like Impressionist art
and classic cars. In a generation's time the auction houses will still be
selling the history of pop music, almost certainly for prices that today
would look extravagant.
It could be regarded as very depressing, suggesting that the new rich, the
successful entrepreneurs in their 30s and 40s, are so culturally deprived
that they would rather spend their superfluous wealth on the paraphernalia
of their youth rather than on the intellectual challenge of becoming
connoisseurs of paintings or porcelain. There is very little artistic merit
in the bulk of the items appearing for sale at Bonhams next Thursday and at
Christie's on September 8, as well as at Sotheby's.
But pop music is certainly the great cultural, and social, phenomenon of the
second half of the 20th century and mementos of icons, be they saints or
military commanders, have always been collected. Like pop itself there is
also a commercial element behind much of the buying. Restaurants, especially
the various Hard Rock Cafes, often walk away with a quarter of the sales for
use in decorating their outlets. Rock museums are also keen buyers. And the
bidders for the Quarrymen tape will surely seek the agreement of the
original song writers to exploit the recording commercially. Lennon could
sing again from the grave.
The Beatles, naturally, dominate the auctions. The Japanese buy nothing but
Beatles. Most of the buyers at the sales are fans - as are the sellers. The
attraction of pop memorabilia is that it reaches down to street level. There
must be thousands of middle-aged women with a signed photograph of the
Beatles. A good example might sell for up to Pounds 600. And there will be
even more thousands with forged Beatles signatures - their Fan Club often
did the job for the Fab Four. Fakes - of gold discs, guitars, and costumes
as well as signatures - are a real problem in this business. The auction
houses spend hours trying to authenticate material and around half the items
offered for sale are declined because of doubts about their provenance.
Apart from the Quarrymen tape the Sotheby's auction has a wide spread of the
most desirable pop memorabilia, making it the best sale for years. Among the
most desirable objects of the sector are autograph original lyrics of
Beatles songs. Sotheby's made Pounds 45,800 from 'I am the walrus' last
year: it hopes for Pounds 30,000 from 'You've got to hide your love away'
next month. Some of the most celebrated lyrics have yet to surface
('Yesterday', for example, would easily top Pounds 100,000): they remain the
sought after 'sleepers' of the pop world.
Along with lyrics well used instruments also arouse great interest. Last
year a Jimi Hendrix Fender guitar went for Pounds 198,000, to the Jimi
Hendrix Museum in Seattle. Sotheby's is selling two more Hendrix guitars
(estimated up to Pounds 60,000) while Bonhams, a new force in this market,
is offering the finest Hendrix archive ever to surface, with a 'Gibson
Flying V' guitar (modestly estimated at up to Pounds 25,000) as well as some
really glamorous clothes, redolent with 1960s chic.
Hendrix is keenly collected. An early death helped, contracting his career
into less than four years, thus ensuring that his paraphernalia is as rare
as it is exotic. There are curious discrepancies between a pop star's
reputation in the real world and in the saleroom. The Rolling Stones have
never punched their commercial weight at the rostrum (a good signed Stone's
autographed photograph might make Pounds 300), perhaps because ex-Stone Bill
Wyman is known to have accumulated an unmatchable archive of the band. Bob
Dylan, too, one of the undoubted giants of the genre, arouses little
excitement, although Sotheby's hopes for Pounds 6,000 for one of his early
harmonicas. (There must be hundreds out there somewhere, but authenticating
that Dylan actually blew them can be tricky).
In contrast Freddie Mercury (dead), Marc Bolan (dead) and the Sex Pistols (a
quarter dead) are auction room favourites. A Mercury postcard ('My dearest
cherry trifle') commands a Pounds 600 top estimate; a Bolan bolero jacket
Pounds 2,500; and Johnny Rotten's lyrics for the Pistol's 'New York', around
the same sum.
Of course the most famous dead rocker is Elvis. One of the many Elvis
museums in the US recently sold off its stock at the Los Angeles saleroom of
Butterfield &amp; Butterfield and ended up Dollars 3.36m richer, with a cream
coloured stage suit racing beyond its Dollars 30,000 estimate to Dollars
101,500. While London is the heart of the international market in pop
memorabilia good Presley material sells best in the US. After all he managed
to avoid the UK in his lifetime, too.
As pop music loses its creative spark it is in danger of becoming a museum
culture. This would be bad news for the auction houses, reduced to recycling
ever more antique material. Fortunately a few contemporary artists catch the
collectors' imagination. Michael Jackson seems to have recovered his appeal
after a bad spell last year; Prince is collected; and, of course, Madonna.
Yet another of the Gaultier designed basques she wore in her Blonde Ambition
tour comes up at Sotheby's commanding a Pounds 12,000 estimate.
Over time pop memorabilia could well merge into the general entertainment
auctions, devoted mainly to Hollywood. Christie's South Kensington is
putting a Barbra Streisand archive into its September 8 auction (with up to
Pounds 4,000 expected for a costume from The Way We Were).
The main experiment at Christie's is the inclusion of the first significant
collection devoted to a jazz giant, Charlie Parker. It belongs to his last
partner, Mrs Chan Parker, and includes music manuscripts, awards and
letters. It should bring in more than Pounds 100,000. If it goes well, jazz
musicians could come into their own commercially in the auction rooms.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Arts: Hans Memling's tortured souls take a trip - Susan
Moore admires the Last Judgment in Bruges but feels it should have stayed in
Gdansk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hans Memling is the most accessible of the so-called Flemish Primitives. He
tempered the angular, agonised style of his probable master Rogier van der
Weyden with a softness and sweetness of expression learnt in his native
Rhineland; his poetic dreaminess and tranquility of mood is arguably more
appealing than Van Eyck's enamel-hard perfection. Memling can be monumental
but he is never heroic.
That, at least, is how he is often perceived. The achievement of the
substantial exhibition in Bruges commemorating the 500th anniversary of his
death in the city is to encourage us to adjust this conventional view. The
process begins almost at once. It is hard to imagine anyone standing before
his little-known and vast 'Last Judgment' for the first time and not
reeling.
The triptych's panels rise some 2.5m high. Underneath the figure of Christ
seated on a brilliant rainbow and in the centre of an arc of human flesh,
stands St Michael, resplendent in gleaming gold armour and peacock wings. He
is weighing the souls of the dead who clamber out of their graves all around
him, indicating the damned with the point of his crozier and dispatching
them to the demons beyond. To the left, guided by St Peter, the righteous
and redeemed calmly climb the crystal staircase to the Gothic gates of
heaven, regaining their earthly identities en route. On the right, the
damned - clerics among them - are herded into the furnace of hell. In the
foreground one doomed soul attempts to claw his way towards salvation but is
stopped in his tracks and dragged back: there is no escape.
For this writhing mass of terrified and tormented humanity, Memling
obviously took great pains to depict the full gamut of man's possible
reaction through gesture and facial expression. Amid the sulphurous flames,
men and women are railing, imploring, recoiling, struggling, screaming,
crying. Although we have no proof, it is tempting to assume that he, like
Leonardo, spent time studying his own grimacing face in a mirror to
understand the grotesque distortions of fear. Tempting, too, to believe that
he made studies from life for the dramatically foreshortened and peculiarly
posed figures in the foreground.
Such painstaking attention to detail is characteristic of Memling's response
to the natural world. The colours of his rainbow are accurately recorded,
the gold of globe and breastplate reflect in miniature the panorama opening
before us, even detailing the barely visible Romanesque towers that loom
behind the heavenly gate. Each petal and leaf, peacock feather and scattered
gemstone is precisely rendered.
This massive altarpiece, arguably Memling's masterpiece, is the coup of the
show. But its loan from the Narodowe Museum in Gdansk smacks of cultural
opportunism. The triptych has only recently been lent to the Stefan Lochner
exhibition in Cologne; any more fortunate institution than the Narodowe is
unlikely to have allowed such a large and vulnerable work of art to travel
at all. Certainly no other big panel painting has come to Bruges. Even a
glance at the central panel of the 'Triptych of Jan Crabbe' is a salutary
reminder of how a panel painting can suffer.
How the painting came to Gdansk is a dramatic tale in itself. Commissioned
by the Florentines Angelo di Jacopo Tani, manager of the Medici bank in
Bruges, and his wife for the chapel they founded and dedicated to St Michael
in his employer's church in Fiesoli, the altarpiece was on its way south
when its ship was intercepted by a Polish warship operating on behalf of the
Hanseatic League. The League was engaged in a trade war with England, the
vessel's first port of call. The donors so soberly depicted on the
triptych's closed doors were never to see their altarpiece again.
Significantly, a number of Memling's most important patrons were Italian.
The astonishing tour de force which represents all the scenes of Christ's
Passion compressed into a single - and fairly small - continuous narrative
image was, for instance, commissioned by Tani's successor Tommaso Portinari.
Memling's position in the cross-current of artistic ideas between North and
South is fascinating. He appears to have been the first in the Low Countries
to paint allegories on themes of love and virtue, a genre popular in Venice
at the time. He also seems to be the first artist anywhere to have the
highly artificial idea of placing his sitters against a pure landscape
background - a device appreciated by his Italian patrons and found later in
the portraits of Leonardo and Botticelli.
The series of small, bust-length portraits here is one of the highlights of
the show - even if the inclusionist approach of curator Dirk De Vos gives us
more than we might have expected. Some were made as wings of lost devotional
works, almost all are tightly framed. Memling's cropping of tops of heads,
hands and shoulders brings to his images the concentration of the close-up.
For all their microscopic detail - every fingernail, eyeball and iris is
outlined, each hair and tuft of stubble individually delineated - these are
personalities that remain enigmatic. No gaze is focused. The sense of
other-worldliness and generalisation is emphasised by the diffuse light and
softened contours. In the case of his sole surviving secular female
portrait, we feel she represents no more than a fashionable ideal of
feminine beauty and piety.
Visitors to Bruges will always be rewarded by the masterpieces permanently
on view in St John's Hospital. Those who come for the exhibition will
discover a subtly different Memling.
The exhibition continues at the Groeningemuseum in Bruges until November 15.
Dirk De Vos' new monograph, Hans Memling: The Complete Works, is published
in English by Thames &amp; Hudson.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Arts: Period-instruments play at the Proms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wednesday's Prom offered Mozart's great if incomplete Mass K427 and
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, both in C minor - which enhanced the contrasts
between them. But what lent the concert a quite particular interest,
obviously (for it was sold out), was the performers: John Eliot Gardiner,
his period 'Orchestre Revolutionnaire et Romantique' and his Monteverdi
Choir, not to mention the distinguished soloists for the Mozart.
Period-instrument playing is hugely, unrecognisably better than it was even
ten years ago, let alone 20 or 30. Allowances no longer have to be made. The
ORR, only four years old now, has been delivering memorable performances
already for Gardiner.
This is not a day-to-day orchestra; its concerts are special events,
scrupulously prepared and repeated in various capitals. Beethoven's Fifth in
the Albert Hall must nevertheless be a severe challenge for the relatively
soft-toned instruments: in that vast space, would they sound tame and frail?
I confess that I listened at home to Radio 3, expecting to hear more of them
that way. Judging by the satisfied roar of the audience at the end, that was
an unnecessary precaution. Anything the orchestra lacked in sheer weight
(not much; their numbers were increased for the occasion) was fully
compensated by swift, clean lines and confident purpose.
Gardiner has been picking over a new edition carefully, and many details
were freshly lit up - sometimes just by the period timbres. The modern
piccolo in the Finale, for example, usually sounds like a steam-whistle;
here, it was woody and gurgly, less shrill but more telling.
We expected Gardiner to give full value to Beethoven's 'con brio' for the
first movement, and he did. Quick and urgent, but crackling with controlled
energy; still more for the 'con moto' Andante, which lost nothing of its
gravity to the conductor's unhesitating tempo. The different instrumental
choirs were pungently contrasted, excellently balanced. The Finale was not
an excited race, but a steady build-up of exuberance that reached
explosion-point just before the end. We hear the Fifth rather a lot, but it
is rare to hear it brought off so excitingly.
The Mozart must have been easier. In fact it was often idyllically
beautiful. Gardiner is sometimes accused of a certain coldness, or at least
coolness, in tender music; but with sopranos like Sylvia McNair and Anne
Sophie von Otter - the one bright and limpid, the other darker, even
slightly languid - there was no risk of that.
The 'Christe Eleison' and the 'Et incarnatus' (at least one of them intended
for Mozart's wife Constanze) were especially lovely passages in a
continuously lovely reading of the score.
In smaller roles the tenor Christoph Pregardien made his mark in the trio,
and Alastair Miles provided a staunch bass; the Monteverdi Choir sang warmly
and elegantly. One should have been there.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Arts: High-spirited Rossini at the Pesaro festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the further side of Italy, Pesaro sits on the sea just south of Rimini.
It was the birthplace of Gioachino Rossini, to whom it owes substantial
benefactions, though he never returned to live there. There is a Fondazione
Rossini for musicological studies, and for many summers now a Rossini Opera
Festival (sponsored this year by Scavolini) which takes account of the
latest findings in Rossini research.
The first of the Rossini operas in the current festival was L'Italiana in
Algeri - 'The Italian Girl in Algiers' - in a larky production by Dario Fo,
the theatrical master-of-all-trades.
The first edition of the score called for several comic dancers and acrobats
besides the singing principals; Fo supplied a whole troupe of them,
enthusiastically playing exotic animals, the Bey's slaves and eunuchs, and
many fanciful supernumeraries. They sported in the shifting waves of a
canvas sea with porpoises, flying fish and drowning sailors; during the
longer arias, they mimed comments and distractions.
There was a wealth of comic ideas in the costumes and the ever-shifting
sets, too, and a lot of cheerful grossness. As usual Fo wanted to find a
humane message in the show as well, and decided that its heroes - the Bey's
Italian captive Lindoro and his newly shipwrecked compatriot Isabella -
represented modern, enlightened Man and Woman against unregenerate machismo.
(The plot is too elaborate to recount, but imagine Mozart's Seraglio with an
extra twist or three.) The actual cast lived up to that with variable
success.
Isabella was the American Jennifer Larmore, currently the queen of Handelian
sopranos. The fluidity and dark richness of the voice are remarkable, and
her confidence boundless; there was no arguing with it. Almost as striking,
though less favoured by her part as the Bey's unhappy wife, was Inger
Dam-Jensen, last year's Cardiff 'Singer of the World'.
In secondary roles Ildebrando D'Arcangelo and the young Russian Svetlana
Sidorova shone, and Bruno Pratico invested bumbling old 'Uncle' Taddeo with
the customary smirks and tics.
The leading men were less happy. Donato Di Stefano's Bey Mustafa, because he
was unwell the night I heard him, and thus unable to provide full vocal
weight for this overweening monster; Markus Schafer's personable Lindoro (a
late substitute), because his tenor was quite unready for the music. Truth
to tell, he did some stylish things in quick music - but at the extreme
heights of his first Cavatina the voice became a banshee screech. The Pesaro
audience decided at once that it hated him, and booed him implacably.
David Robertson (of the Ensemble InterContemporain) fared no better with
them, though the orchestra of Bologna's Teatro Communale sounded well enough
under him. Perhaps the audience resented his gentle protests on behalf of
the unlucky Schafer ; but perhaps also they thought, as I did, that so much
imperfect ensemble between orchestra and singers was unacceptable at a
fourth performance.
Yet even the ruckus was good-humoured; Fo's high-spirited production made it
hard for anybody to feel otherwise.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Arts: Music wallowing in seductive eroticism - Voluptuous
paintings, sensuous music and sex on the Fringe as the Edinburgh Festival
enters its second week / Sex and religion are essential ingredients in
Chabrier's 'Briseis'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN

<TEXT>
In recent years the Edinburgh festival has specialised in digging out the
bits and pieces of the opera repertoire that are tucked away in the
appendices of history books. Forgotten operas, unfinished operas, fragments
of operas, the festival has unearthed them all. A headless torso, like
Chabrier's Briseis, is its speciality.
Like any hopeful seeking attention, Briseis comes with a recommendation from
a friend of the family: Richard Strauss, no less, conducted the first staged
performance in Berlin in 1899. A production followed in Paris a few months
later, but never in Britain, and not often anywhere else. It is hard to see
how there could be. Chabrier left only four scenes, which do not advance
beyond setting up the central dilemma of the plot.
The story is taken from Goethe's ballad The Bride of Corinth, but Chabrier
and his librettists contrived to make it look like any other French opera
from the end of the 19th century. Sex and religion are the essential
ingredients. Combine them, as Massenet observed, and you have good
box-office. At the point where Chabrier laid down his pen, a little over an
hour into the opera, the titular heroine is heading off over the dunes,
condemned to be a 'virgin in eternity', just like Massenet's Thais.
Given that she and her boyfriend Hylas have just been drenched in a
60-minute outpouring of music saturated in sensuality, that seems like
wishful thinking. Wagner knew to set the love music of Tristan und Isolde a
world apart. Although Chabrier has absorbed much of that opera's heady
atmosphere, he does not know when to stop. One highly-charged passage of
throbbing phrases sounds particularly erotic, until one realises that it
accompanies a man of God praying to the words, 'Jesus, have pity on a woman
who is about to die'.
In short, there is not much theatrical grip here. What exists of Briseis is
best heard in the concert-hall, where one can wallow in the seductive
eroticism of its music without worrying about what has happened to the
drama. This is what Edinburgh offered with a concert performance at the
Usher Hall on Thursday, conducted with splendid elan by Jean Yves Ossonce
and played with plausibly sumptuous sonorities by the BBC Scottish Symphony
Orchestra.
Joan Rodgers and Mark Padmore were the two lovers, her soprano sweet and
pure, his tenor rather white-toned in the early music style, though it was
good of him to learn such a rare piece at short notice. Kathryn Harries sang
the dying mother, who gloats outrageously when she discovers that she can
win a reprieve from Christ by committing her daughter to eternal virginity -
a Mephistophelean pact, if ever there was one. Simon Keenlyside's Christian
was vocally more persuasive than Michael George's heathen Olympian.
The opera was preceded by a group of other Chabrier bon-bons - Espana as the
showpiece opener, the Ode a la musique, and La Sulamite, a choral scene
taken from the Song of Songs, which climaxes in a Bacchic finale replete
with pulsating orchestra and orgiastic yelping. Having him as a composer of
the year will be fun, if nothing else.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Arts: Strictly Ballroom meets Midsummer Night's Dream -
Voluptuous paintings, sensuous music and sex on the Fringe as the Edinburgh
Festival enters its second week / Martin Hoyle talks to Baz Luhrmann, who is
directing Britten's work for Australian Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE

<TEXT>
A fairy-story happy ending, make-believe glamour, rebellion against
authority: I try to tick off the elements of A Midsummer Night's Dream that
might have attracted the director of the film Strictly Ballroom. Though Baz
Luhrmann is best known for the runaway success of his affectionate look at
the world of dance steps and sequins, Australian Opera's production, with
the same director and design team, of Britten's Shakespearian comedy has
already sold out for its three performances at Edinburgh next week. Will the
gently satiric flavour of the film be repeated in the opera? For those
coming to opera from outside, the spangled glitziness must seem as
artificial, sometimes as tatty, as ballroom dance.
In fact this is not Baz Luhrmann's first opera production. He has a
resoundingly successful Boheme to his credit; and his interest in music
theatre goes back to a community musical devised and written with a local
composer for Rockhampton, a Queensland cattle town. 'It was a cathartic
experience. I had done theatre, not directed film though I'd acted in some,
but I'd always loved music as a story-telling language.' The road to
Damascus continued through Australian Opera who were dealing with the
problem of their audiences 'literally dying off'. Luhrmann admits to the
usual early preconceptions about opera, preferring concerts or listening to
CDs 'watching the sunset rather than watching shaky sets and those
disconnected people.'
Aware of opera's popularity in Europe where students queue for tickets, he
took in the famous ENO production of Masked Ball which provoked fisticuffs
in the foyer, and the 'fantastically clear and delicious' Love of Three
Oranges, Prokofiev directed by Richard Jones for Opera North and ENO. Even
so he regarded Australian Opera's approach as a challenge. 'I wasn't sure I
wanted to do this. Then I began to explore the origins of Italian opera, an
incredibly popular form with street-sweepers and kings, the film and
television of its day, yet told through music.'
One reservation remained, summed up in what Luhrmann describes as his
'biggest passion': 'I don't want the work to become a club culture,
expensive or elitist'. He sees opera's socialite aura reflected in an
elitist aesthetic. 'We come from a school all about abstraction,
psychological gesture, even working against the narrative.' He must mean
Mister (or Ms) Whatsit's production of - but you can fill in the blanks
yourselves. 'Concept is not my favourite word,' he says coolly.
Zeffirelli came to film from opera, Visconti always worked in both, and now
more directors are moving to opera from film. Luhrmann shares the growing
conviction that the flexibility of film on the one hand and the high
theatricality of opera on the other leave so-called straight theatre
increasingly stranded as an art form. 'Theatre gets lost in the gap.
Theatre's got to be theatrical. If it's people sitting round a table you
might as well stick a camera there.' Surprisingly this carries over into
acting where 'opera and film share more things than opera and theatre. For a
start they both synthesize music, drama, the plastic arts. Film sound-tracks
are like operas, they're created to tell stories. Young directors are
turning to opera. Robert Altman tells me he's going to do another opera.
It's to do with intensity.'
For some directors, notably Ken Russell, opera's artificial form is
heavensent for high camp or low farce. A Midsummer Night's Dream dangerously
contains the seeds of both with its fairies and base mechanicals. One can
feel an apprehensive twitch among British music-lovers as the Luhrmann
direction (plus the visual lushness of designers Catherine Martin and Bill
Marron) homes in. 'People say they can see a consistent style: we set out to
reveal the story. I have a real interest in myth. The land of ballroom
dancing is a land far, far away; we exploit it with a simple story. There
are parallels with the Dream. Neither is psychologically realistic
story-telling. We know the audience knows how it will end. We want the
audience to enjoy the journey.'
Luhrmann approached the work with an open mind. 'We've never made a decision
about 'concept' or 'traditional'. Each piece has its language - rhythm,
punctuation, different texture - which should grow out of it. Everyone's
looking for the hip, the right, the now thing: a bit dangerous.'
Director and designers stayed in Aldeburgh 'in the middle of winter,
incredibly cold. After five minutes you get a sense of the music.' Does
background knowledge of the composer help? 'Britten specifically left the
'club' opera of London. There's a feeling of community inherent in his work.
We asked ourselves why, put on in any opera house, the Dream seems to be at
the heart of a community - especially between orchestra and stage. I once
naively turned to the pit and was told 'You don't have to talk to them,
Baz,' as if they were terrible people in prison. I was shocked to find some
orchestral members don't know the story of what they're playing. In our
production the orchestra becomes characters on stage. I hope it's a
humanist, not a design-led, production'
The acting is important. Luhrmann condemns those who put theatrical illusion
low on the list of operatic priorities. 'Britten (like Mozart and Puccini)
talked about his revulsion at a kind of pretentiousness: how some
opera-goers like bad acting.' This may have evolved, of course, through
opera-singers' once notorious unsuitability for depicting the young and
beautiful; and the physical demands of singing that leave little energy for
characterisation. The director will have none of it. 'I try to cast singers
who can act, helped by Australian Opera's commitment to ensemble. In Boheme
I had two sensational artists.' He praises the inventiveness of singing
actors. 'You want to marry them. You love them because you can then do your
job: to be the audience, guide, not invent for them.'
There are traps in The Dream. 'The piece is flawed in construction. There
are actual great holes in it. Some scoring is fantastic, some is not. I try
to make the players play the truth of the moment. It's absolute death to say
'Here comes the funny bit'.' He broods on the variety of acting one
experiences in opera. 'With others you virtually show them how to clean
their teeth.'
Since Strictly Ballroom Luhrmann - the boy whose father for a time owned a
cinema in a small country town - has a had a production deal with Twentieth
Century Fox to make films anywhere as writer, producer, director. As for
opera, 'It's no secret that most houses in England and Europe have
approached me. I want to continue in opera. My real intention is to continue
the journey inventing an operatic language. We set out to open the door to
what's musically obscure to lots of people.' The man who discovered opera by
chance in his twenties is determined to show the way. 'The tune, the tune
itself, should be able to transcend time and place and geography and creed
and colour.'

FT  20 AUG 94 / Arts: A day in the life of a festival groupie - Voluptuous

enters its second week / Alastair Macaulay avoids the vampires but finds
just about everything else

At 7.am: rise; and shine; and write about yesterday.
10.10 am: a 20-minute walk along the links and the meadows towards the
Queens Hall and breakfast. The longer I work each morning, the later I set
off, and the less time for coffee and croissants. On some occasions my mouth
has still been full as the morning's artist ascends the platform.
11 am Queen's Hall. (Official Festival.) Or, on this occasion, four artists:
the Borodin Quartet. This year, at Edinburgh, is Beethoven year, and the
Borodin players are giving morning and evening all-Beethoven recitals. This
has its fascinations, especially in comparing early Beethoven with late. One
music-critic chum, however, says 'I can't bear the moral certainty of
Beethoven and the Germans'. I don't agree, since Beethoven's music to my ear
has plenty of questioning, not least in the quartets; and, anyway, I am
enough of an idealist or zealot to be a sucker for what moral certainties
that he does offer - as in Fidelio or the Fifth Symphony. But debates about
such matters are part of why I love coming to the festival. It might be
better if the debate was helped along by programming Beethoven in context -
in particular of Haydn and Mozart, and of Schubert and Schumann. Still, an
all-Beethoven concert contents me much (and the all-Fidelio day thrilled me
to the marrow).
12.30 am The music critic who cannot abide Beethoven also cannot abide
Indian food: in which case it is no-go to the excellent Indian vegetarian
restaurant near the Queen's Hall. Today, we plump for echt Scottish food in
the Grassmarket: for me, haggis with tatties and neeps.
2 pm Assembly Rooms. Off Out. (Festival Fringe.) All about prostitutes and
their men. Are most fringe plays about sex? If not, I have an uncanny knack
in avoiding the chaste ones. This year has a bumper crop of smutty titles -
Ilsa, Queen of the Nazi Love Camp, Dudes with Dicks, etc . . . Several of
those with harmless titles turn out to cover one or more variety of sexual
perversion. (When clocking in at the Fringe press office this year, I said
'I can't wait to see Vampire Girlie Poofs of Sodom.' A press officer said
'Oh, are you going to all four vampire shows this year?') For Off Out, the
author is Gill Adams, the company is Hull Truck. Those of us who do not
frequent the company of prostitutes may find an occasional dose of this kind
of thing salutary; my dosage, however, has been quite regular, and though
this play is sound enough it takes me nowhere other plays have not taken me
before.
3.30. pm. Walking from the New Town to the Old, I bump into several
colleagues in succession. 'Have you seen anything wonderful?' comes the
question. 'Not so far,' I reply.
4.30 pm. Pleasance. A Midsummer Night's Dream (Fringe.) I have also been
told on no account to miss the Ukrainian company Theatre-on-Podol. In the
queue to see its 100-minute version of Shakespeare's comedy, I meet two
Canadians whom I told of the good word about Podol last night. They tell me
that they're glad I'm here because if it's no good they'll lynch me. Oh
dear. Well, it is A Midsummer Night's Dream, but the further it departs from
Shakespeare the more enthralling it becomes. (An odd touch comes when the
rustics switch from Ukrainian into Shakespearian English for Pyramus and
Thisbe: eg: 'I zank zou, Moon, for zy glattering beams,' etc . . .) Theseus
is sick; he and his court dream the story of erotic magic and fairies in the
wood. Later, when Bottom &amp; Co. play Pyramus and Thisbe at court, Theseus
suddenly takes cruel revenge on Bottom for having made it (even if in ass's
form) with Hippolyta-Titania; he stops the play and hands Bottom-Pyramus a
real sword to kill himself with. So Bottom-Pyramus dies the noble Athenian
way, and Flute-Thisbe follows suit; Hippolyta is aghast but powerless.
Suddenly, however, Bottom and Flute spring back to life; they were good
enough actors to fake death; and the joke, or dream, was on the nobles. All
which turns the play into a Marivaux-type play about heart and
heartlessness. The lights go up. Oh dear. The Canadians are tetchy. They are
in Edinburgh because of Robert Lepage and his new Seven Streams of the River
Ota. They think Lepage's Dream was definitive and poetic and Shakespearian,
and they are cross because the Podel version is not. Nervously, I encourage
them to talk Lepage, but this does not help matters. Like most people, they
did not like The Seven Streams. I scarper before they decide to lynch me
after all.
7.30. pm. Playhouse Theatre. Miami City Ballet dancing Balanchine.
(Official.) To say that this year's festival includes the only three dance
companies in the world I now care about is to exaggerate, but not much.
(Mark Morris and Merce Cunningham are the other two.) Tonight reminds me
what I had almost forgotten: that Balanchine ballets are, or should be,
constantly dramatic and poetic illuminations of space itself. Also of music.
11 pm Traverse Theatre. Killer Joe. (Fringe.) More sex. Also, in this case,
a hired killer, nudity, adultery, and double-crossing. There is even that
rarest Fringe commodity, virginity - though not for long. The play ends with
the ex-virgin going berserk with a gun. After she has shot most of her
nearest and dearest she aims the gun at the hired killer who she meant to
marry and announces 'I'm pregnant.' It is acted, well, by Hired Gun Theatre
from Chicago, and set in a trailer park in Texas. My date, a New Yorker,
tells me: 'All Chicago theatre is like that.' She explains why, but l am too
tired to take it in. We stagger home. There are a million messages on the
answering machine, all from fringe companies doing vampire shows at
half-past-midnight this week. But at 1 am, my head hits the pillow like
lead.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Arts: Drawn to the Border and East - Voluptuous paintings,
sensuous music and sex on the Fringe as the Edinburgh Festival enters its
second week / William Packer finds the city full of art and reviews the
watercolours of David Wilkie and 'Visions of the Ottoman Empire'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
With the greatest controversy of Edinburgh's first festival week centred
centring upon an issue that was nothing to do with the festival at all but
manifestly to do with the of broader genuine national interest in the visual
arts, one might almost have thought that at last painting and sculpture were
again close to the festival's own deeply cultivated heart. Far from it.
Timothy Clifford's unfortunate indiscretion which, by the cruellest irony,
had put in jeopardy the acquisition of Canova's 'Three Graces' which he
himself had fought so hard to secure, it seems has now been most
magnanimously forgiven. Thank goodness for that, for the sculpture is a very
great work of art. But it was all an involuntary smokescreen, and once the
smoke has cleared, the festival's habitual cultural parochialism remains
unchanged stands revealed as much the same, as ever, and the visual arts as
peripheral to the festival's purposes as ever.
The principal gallery directors say that there is no co-operation
forthcoming from the festival organisers. Brian McMaster, the festival's
director, has said that he wishes only for more a close closer an engagement
with the visual arts, which this year was scotched  - if that's the word I
want - by the museums and galleries themselves. Such is the current
stand-off that the only concession is an undifferentiated listing in the
festival brochure. That apart, exhibitions, officially, do not exist.
Of course there is a great deal to see, and much of it of a very high
quality, for those in charge of Edinburgh's exhibiting institutions are not
fools all the time, and with the city full of visitors, what better time to
give them a treat. Mr Clifford's own National Galleries of Scotland show the
way with four strong and varied shows of which two, Monet to Matisse at the
National Gallery, and The Romantic Spirit in German Art 1790-1990, split
between the Royal Scottish Academy and the Fruitmarket Gallery, warrant the
separate consideration I shall give them next week. Both of them have their
faults, and not all of them inconsiderable, but that said, they both contain
a remarkable proportion of rare and beautiful things. , and the last thing
this critic, at least, would wish would be to persuade the potential visitor
away. Go and take issue with the selection, the rationale or the
installation of the show by all means, but go also to revel in the
particular works for their own sakes.
The other two shows are at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, and
at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. The retrospective of the
water-colours of Sir William Gillies at the SNGMA (Belford Road, until
September 25: sponsored by Atlas Hydraulic Loaders) is modest enough in
scale, but it draws attention to an artist of most distinctive quality who,
as is so often the way with our painter knights, has suffered an undue
neglect. That an institution of the SNGMA's international standing, not to
say ambition, in the related fields of modern and contemporary art, should
consider such an exercise in belated recognition worthwhile at such a time
is indeed encouraging, at least to those of us who take a view broader than
the immediate currency of the avant-garde.
Gillies died in 1973 at the age of 74. His working life had been centred
upon Edinburgh, where he had been the Principal of the College of Art, and
latterly the Border landscape where he had made his home. That consideration
alone is enough to have secured him his southern obscurity in the south.
Brought up in the Scottish Colourist tradition, broadened by direct contact
with the School of Paris and leavened by a natural expansive expressionism
by no means foreign to the Scottish temperament, he produced work of a
freshness and liveliness of handling, and directness of observation, that
are at once charming and convincing. He loved the very act of painting, of
filling the brush with paint and drawing it across the paper, which of
itself, he said, led him back into a deeper consideration of the world he
saw. The mood of the landscape, the very feel of the weather, were what
stimulated and excited him, which we catch in his every scurry of the pen
and drag and flick of the brush. His peers are such artists as the brothers
Paul and, in particular, John Nash, Ivon Hitchins, Graham Sutherland, Keith
Vaughan . . .
The only pity is that this is no full retrospective by which he might claim
his place among them. Some substantial oil paintings by him, however, are
currently on view in The Colourist Legacy at the City Art Centre (2 Market
Street until September 21), which draws on the City's own collections in
following the Scottish Colourist tradition from the Glasgow Boys and the
Colourists themselves - Peploe, Cadell and Fergusson - at the turn of the
century, through the Edinburgh School - of which Gillies was a central
figure from the 1930s to the '70s - and so down to the present day.
Visions of the Ottoman Empire, at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery
(Queen Street, until November 6: sponsored by Blackwall Green, the Hope
Scott Trust, Martin &amp; Frost, Momart, Stanhope Palmer Charity), is a show of
a very different kind, a dense but rewarding study of the response of
artists, writers and travellers of the 18th and 19th centuries - and of
writers, photographers and travellers, too, to both the myth and the reality
of life and travel in the old Turkish Empire. The starting point,
intriguingly, is taken with Watteau's exquisitely sensuous and mysterious
'Fetes Venitiennes' of 1719, with its youths and lovers flirting beneath the
trees and the maturer stranger in Eastern dress paying court to the fine
lady. So is established the image of the East, and with it the ideas of
personal freedom, sensuality and danger that so exercised the Romantic
imagination.
Off they all went: Lady Hester Stanhope, Lord Byron, Robert Burton, and with
them went the artist adventurers, William Allan, David Wilkie, David
Roberts, J. F. Lewis, Edward Lear, Arthur Melville and the rest of them.
Ingres dreamt up images of decadence and indulgence, Delacroix of passion
and violence. The English and the Scotch Scottish were more down to earth,
hinting at assignations and adventures perhaps, but set into a known and
closely observed everyday, albeit exotic world. John Frederick Lewis, who
lived in Cairo for most of the 1850s, is the undoubted star, though Roberts
runs him close.
Lewis has been dismissed too often as a mere decorator and illustrator in
water-colour. He is much more than that, and it is good to see his oil
paintings here beside the works on paper, to establish his scope. His
accuracy is phenomenal, his psychological insight no less convincing, though
set more perhaps to Victorian sentimental expectations, as his young girls
flirt vicariously through the medium of the elderly scribe, than to the
Oriental reality. Here is the fantasy of the harem: the girl pins her hair
before the glass as her friend gossips at the window. The light streams
through the latticed shutter. The silks and scarves hang softly down. The
dream is complete.

PIONEER FEMINIST, LITERARY STAR, FLAUBERT'S MUSE by Francine du Plessix Grey
Hamish Hamilton Pounds 20, 432 pages
On his deathbed in 1880, Flaubert screamed out 'I'm dying like a poisoned
dog, but that tart Emma Bovary will live forever.' The model and muse for
Emma, however, was by then already dead and forgotten. She was Louise Colet,
Flaubert's mistress in the 1840s and 50s, and this book is an attempt to
give her a place in literary history.
They met at her Paris salon when he was an obscure provincial writer and she
a famous poetess and beauty whose friends included Victor Hugo and George
Sand. Within days, Flaubert and Colet were making love in a hansom cab as it
lurched frenetically round Paris - an episode satirised in Madame Bovary,
where a grotesquely swaying, darkened cab with Emma and her lover inside it
announces their adultery to the town of Rouen. Colet never forgave Flaubert
for this travesty; Sartre, reading between the lines of their letters, was
certain that Flaubert was impotent in the cab and that the venomous scene in
the novel was his revenge for the humiliation.
The couple were not well suited. Louise was a flamboyant Provencal who wrote
florid verses, loved big city glamour, and once stabbed a critic with a
kitchen knife. Like Emma Bovary, she had as a child hidden in the woods to
read romantic stories, and she was drenched in the sort of sentimental
idealism which was Emma's downfall.
By contrast, Flaubert was a cold northerner who lived as a hermit in
Normandy with his mother, and cynically rationed their affair according to
the progress of Bovary. When he needed inspiration or a detail from Louise's
girlhood to flesh out the story, he was the importunate lover. Otherwise,
despite her anger and an impromptu visit to his estate - she was turned away
at the gate - the relationship was mostly postal.
It is from his letters to Louise that we draw a picture of Flaubert's five
year ordeal in writing Madame Bovary, and they form a unique record of
literary composition. 'One week - two pages'; 'this one inn scene will take
me three months' he writes. Life and art merged cruelly. When Louise offered
Flaubert a cigar holder inscribed amor nel cor, the motto found its way on
to the signet ring Emma gives her lover Rodolphe. As he was imagining
Rodolphe's letter of rejection, Flaubert wrote his own, less regretful one,
to Louise.
She consoled herself with a roman a clef - which made Flaubert 'split his
sides laughing' - and with other poet-lovers, including Musset and Vigny.
She never lost her grand gestures, and at the end of her life announced that
her heart was 'as empty of emotion for Flaubert as Pompeii is of
inhabitants.'
Francine du Plessix Grey is probably right that Emma was Louise with her
blue stockings off - 'a highly sexed narcissist, seldom satisfied with
reality, seeking in others a glorified image of herself.' The trouble with
this biography is that, as Flaubert knew, such a subject is soon tedious
unless mocked - thus the exquisite irony in Madame Bovary. With the invented
dialogue and purple reconstructions here, on the other hand, Louise Colet's
story reads more like a Mills and Boon of the Paris salons than a literary
biography. ''Why Monsieur Flaubert, perhaps it's you who should be my
mentor' . . . 'Save for a delectable lunch of shellfish served right in
their room . . . Louise and Gustav seem barely to have left their bed'.'
Ms du Plessix Grey says she wrote this book 'to reinstate a colleague into
the annals of her time . . . to resurrect yet another woman whose memory has
been erased by the caprices of men.' To present this kind of kiss 'n tell
memoir in feminist colours is preposterous. Gender is not the point:
Flaubert is remembered because he wrote a masterpiece, Colet is forgotten
because she did not. Her story as presented here is of interest - but only
in the context of his.

THE HIDDEN HUXLEY: CONTEMPT AND COMPASSION FOR THE MASSES edited by David
Bradshaw Faber and Faber Pounds 17.50, 255 pages
As the pieces re-printed in The Hidden Huxley make clear, Aldous Huxley was
a push-over for a great many crackpot ideas as well as sensible ones. His
genius was to absorb abstruse ideas and to promote them as ironic paradoxes.
David Bradshaw, who is working on a fresh life of the author, causes us to
ask whose side Huxley was really on in his celebrated anti-utopian fantasy,
Brave New World (1932).
Bradshaw points to Huxley's hitherto neglected admiration for the work of
the American journalist HL Mencken, the co-editor of The Smart Set
periodical, 'the most celebrated adversary of mass-democracy in the
English-speaking world'. Huxley gave laudatory coverage to Mencken's book
Prejudices in the Athenaeum arts and literary weekly and sent Mencken his
novel Crome Yellow, which was duly praised for its masterly irony.
Bradshaw shows Huxley approvingly echoing Mencken's division of society into
an elite of ability and the toiling masses and finds Huxley similarly
welcoming HG Wells's world-order headed by a ruling caste of Samurai.
Bradshaw also quotes from Huxley's Athenaeum column and reprints his later
pre-second war journalism in support of philosophers such as Pareto, who
contributed significantly to the ideology of fascism.
In later life Huxley found his guru in that enigmatic character Gerald
Heard, with whom he was in contact when he moved from Europe to California
in 1937. Heard appears as the mystic Propter in Huxley's novel After Many a
Summer (1939). Time Must Have a Stop (1944), set in pre-war London and
Florence, preached asceticism and showed the direction in which Huxley's
thought had moved, as did his study of consensus among the religions of
mankind, The Perennial Philosophy (1946).
His Doors of Perception (1954) describing his experience with the drug
mescalin, became a bible of the Beat Generation. He also turned at this time
to history, in studies like The Devils of Loudon (1952), where he found
object-lessons for the madnesses of the present in the past.
One of his greatest gifts was for conversation. In a live recording made in
1961, Personally Speaking, he talks uninhibitedly about writing as a career,
Freud, DH Lawrence, drug-taking, mysticism - all his pet hobby-horses.
The voice is an upper-class sing-song in which every syllable is clearly
enunciated rising in a crescendo as his conclusions are rammed home. He
argues, for example, that advances in the arts often come about in an
inexplicable and unprecedented manner rather than as a response to
historical circumstances. 'Out of the blue' he said, 'Chaucer developed
individual psychology . . . art has its own internal logic'. In his own
case, however, his art - quasi-mysticism apart - was highly dependent upon
events in the external world.

POLITICAL MEMOIR: ESSAYS ON THE POLITICS OF MEMORY edited by George Egerton
Frank Cass Pounds 38, 351 pages
Political memoirs are not a new phenomenon. Otto von Bismarck's sold 300,000
copies within a few weeks of publication in 1898. The Earl of Clarendon's
History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England, which first appeared in
1702, ran into 20 printings and established the economic foundation of the
Oxford University Press.
One can go back further. Julius Caesar's Commentaries on the Gallic War
continues to be read. And if one spreads the definition of political memoirs
widely, so does the Confessions of St Augustine.
There is nothing new either about memoirs being at least a partial
distortion of the truth. Marshal Foch, who led the French and eventually the
allied forces in the first world war, said that he never wrote his memoirs
because he had nothing to hide.
Another view, quoted in the chapter on Indian memoirs in this book, is
simply: 'I really don't understand why intelligent people risk to compose
autobiographies. That itself is a matter of psychoanalytical study.'
Yet the motives for writing political memoirs, though mixed, are fairly
clear. As Stephen Ambrose, a biographer of Presidents Eisenhower and Nixon,
writes here, they include making money, catharsis after office, and attempts
to influence later historians, to get back at enemies and to justify one's
own actions.
Ambrose tells a story about the Liars' Club in Burlington, Wisconsin.
Portraits of three US presidents hang on the wall: George Washington because
he never told a lie; Lyndon Johnson because he never told the truth; and
Richard Nixon because he did not know the difference. Ambrose says that this
is too kind to Nixon: it was not that he did not know the difference, but
that he did not care about the difference. 'He had a Soviet mentality with
regard to historical truth. He believed that the past should serve the needs
of the present.'
Still, it is striking that even Ambrose concludes that the Nixon memoirs
have the great virtue of being authentic. Without the memoirs, we would have
known less about the man, including his achievements.
Other anecdotes abound in this generally rather academic collection of
essays on political memoir as a genre. (The word, incidentally, that we must
learn to use is 'polygenre'.) President Truman had virtually no income -
only an old army pension - when he left the White House. He was eventually
offered Dollars 600,000 for his memoirs by Time-Life, Inc, but found it hard
to get adequate researchers. He gently fired the first two, then came up
with Morton Royce, a professor at Georgetown University who was working on a
multi-volume history of the world, but had produced almost nothing. Royce
kept asking Truman irritating questions and still failed to write, so he,
too, had to go.
The memoirs, which Truman described as his 'history', were written almost on
time, as Francis H. Heller, who was largely responsible for putting them
together, tells here. Subsequently it was discovered that Truman was not a
bad writer in his own right, though he may have been dyslexic: he could
never spell the name of his secretary of state, Dean Acheson, which came out
as Atchison or Atcheson.
George Egerton, the editor of the essays, is a Canadian and the collection
has a strong north American emphasis. Yet the Canadians, like the British,
have had their publishing dramas. In the mid-1940s, for example, the
Canadian Liberal Party bought the entire edition (over 15,000 copies) of a
biography of Mackenzie King before it reached the bookshops because it was
thought to be hostile to the prime minister.
King himself had the novel idea of writing his memoirs based on his diaries
and incinerating the diaries as the work progressed, though like Edward
Heath's so far, the memoirs did not appear. The diaries survived.
The recent spate of British political memoirs is not much covered, but there
is a reminder that the genre may not be improving with time, length and the
increasing use of researchers. When the late Reginald Maudling published his
book in 1978, it was called simply Memoirs and ran to under 300 pages. The
author confessed that he had kept only one detailed record in his life. It
was about the consultations on whether he would serve under Alec
Douglas-Home as prime minister. But the record was taken in pencil and was
illegible when he came to consult it. 'Anyway', he wrote, 'the details do
not matter all that much'. That was authentic Maudling.
Where I think that this academic book falls down is in directing the fire at
the memoirists, not the publishers. Of course politicians want to write, and
so they should. But they do need editing, pruning and checking. This no
longer happens. Recently I went through the dozen or so memoirs that include
accounts by participants of a famous British cabinet meeting on Westland.
Every one was different, often substantially. Someone should have noticed.

reviews the life of South African novelist and politician Alan Paton

ALAN PATON: A BIOGRAPHY by Peter F Alexander Oxford Pounds 25, 510 pages
In September 1946 a middle-aged Borstal headmaster from South Africa was in
Norway on a study tour. He visited Trondheim Cathedral, went back to his
hotel and, homesick, began to write: 'There is a lovely road that runs from
Ixopo into the hills. These hills are grass-covered and rolling, and they
are lovely beyond any singing of it . . .'
He was Alan Paton and he would take just three months to complete Cry, the
Beloved Country, the novel which changed his life and, just conceivably,
altered the world's perception of South Africa.
It is - what? One of the finest novels of the century? Surely not. One of
the most moving? Yes. One of the most memorable, powerful, effective,
influential? Certainly. And what were Alan Paton's other achievements?
Peter Alexander has written an excellent biography of an interesting and
important man who died, in 1988, just a few years before the coming of the
democratic and non-racial society for which he had fought and written. The
story is told steadily (57 pages to get to varsity sex), respectfully, warts
and all, and the judgment is well-considered and balanced. Mr Alexander
liked and admired Paton, and owed him favours, but this is no hagiography.
To get the warts out of the way, Paton had an unpromising Christadelphian
background, hated his authoritarian father, had a sad, sexually unhappy
marriage with an older woman, became in turn a bad parent, was feared and
detested by his pupils when a schoolmaster, was a flogger of sadistic
dimensions, and may even have drunk too much. All this for a man whose
international image has for years been that of a Christian writer-hero
defying the apartheid government to do its worst.
It is a compliment to Alexander that, in Cromwellian style, the portrait
proceeds from there. Paton was shaped by his childhood in Maritzburg; he
carried from it a passion for the African landscape, an instinct to fight
authority, a Christian faith which he was able to adapt to the less
puritanical Anglican Church, and which gave him the biblical cadences of his
distinctive prose style.
His idealism led him from schoolteaching (the pupils cheered when he almost
lost his sight in an accident) to the desperate job of rescuing the black
reformatory at Diepkloof, a terrible institution when he arrived in 1935,
and which was to give him 13 happy and inspired years as he learned about
his country and discovered the necessity to build bridges across the colour
line.
After the instant, worldwide success of Cry, the Beloved Country he left
government service and set out to write (he found it depressingly difficult
to produce a second book) and then to move into politics. The story of the
founding of the South African Liberal Party is not new but is told well,
including Paton's anguish when the multi-racialism and non-violence of the
Party came under pressure from within. There seems to have been happiness in
the later years in the Valley of a Thousand Hills when he married a
formidable second wife who became notorious among politicians and
journalists for the rigour with which she guarded him.
He did not write all that many books, partly because he gave so much of his
time to politics, which included his journalism. There were only two other
novels - Too Late the Phalarope (1953), which was probably overpraised when
it appeared, and the rather odd Ah, But Your Land Is Beautiful (1981). There
were some short stories and two biographies - of his friend, the flawed
statesman Jan Hofmeyr, and his Archbishop, Geoffrey Clayton - neither of
which, we can now see, cut to the bone with the instinct of the natural
biographer. The two-volume autobiography had its areas of discretion.
Alexander is enthusiastic about a slim volume of Christian meditation,
Instrument Of Thy Peace (1967), which apparently was his second most popular
book (and which reviewers like this one have never read])
Paton, in public, always looked like a Methodist lay preacher, and this
biography does not contradict that aspect of him: it is true that he was a
fine orator. There remains a touch of mystery in the transformation of a
small-town schoolmaster with a cane in his hand to an
internationally-celebrated figurehead of liberalism.
Alexander does not go out of his way to deny that Paton wrote only one
'great' book. I suggest that he understates the sheer courage of the man in
the face of constant harassment and vilification. He correctly concludes
that, never mind the mean quibbling of the ANC and Black Consciousness,
Paton's Liberalism kept alive for South Africa certain values in a time of
great darkness; Paton then had the courage to close down the Party when it
could not continue with integrity.
Alexander has a nice final quote, supplied by Paton himself, from a certain
Sir Robert Shirley, whose encomium was that he 'did the best of things in
the worst of times, and hoped them in the most calamitous'. He kept the
faith. Woza Alan]

THE QUARK AND THE JAGUAR by Murray Gell-Mann Little, Brown Pounds 18.99, 392
pages
BLACK HOLES AND TIME WARPS: EINSTEIN'S OUTRAGEOUS LEGACY by Kip Thorn
Picador Pounds 20, 619 pages
Imagine a medieval stonemason resting from his labours half way up a Gothic
cathedral spire. He gazes - if he is a man of sensibility, he marvels - at
the world spread around him. What does he see? Leaving aside details like
urban sprawl, factory chimneys and passing aircraft, he sees much the same
world as we now do. But in another sense of 'see' we see the world in a way
inconceivable for him, because the stories told then and now about the
nature and origins of the universe are vastly different. Both stories are
strange and in their way beautiful; but the one told by modern science is
infinitely stranger and more beautiful than any hitherto dreamt by mankind.
A swarm of popularising science books reaches the market each year, seeking
to give the general public an understanding of the latest developments. Most
are good, because most scientists and their commentators are an intelligent
crew who enjoy what they do. But these two additions to the swarm are
special: for their authors are extremely distinguished original contributers
to the scientific endeavours they describe. These are reports from the
cutting edge, and they are presented with eloquence and style.
Murray Gell-Mann won the Nobel prize for physics in 1969, and later helped
establish the Santa Fe Institute, an interdisciplinary foundation devoted to
the study of 'complex systems' as various as quantum mechanics, the human
body, and international economics. The key concepts which interest him are
simplicity and complexity. The fundamental units of matter - quarks and
leptons - are simple entities. Everything built out of them is complex; but
among the most interesting complex things are those possessing a capacity to
change in response to information about their surroundings. Gell-Mann's aim
is to understand these 'adaptive systems', of which biological entities are
a prime example, by tracing the chain of relationships between them and
simpler levels of the world.
Gell-Mann's main theme is the interaction between physics and chance. Our
present understanding of nature's fundamental laws, he says, promises that
we might soon have a unified theory of all particles and forces. Chance
enters the picture because these laws are quantum-mechanical; they offer
only probabilities. So nature is indeterministic, a feature magnified by the
phenomenon of 'chaos', in which small imprecisions in data about initial
conditions give rise to huge indeterminacies in prediction-as exemplified by
the difficulties of weather forecasting. But these factors mean that at
certain points in the universe's history conditions are right for the
emergence of complex adaptive systems. The same concepts that apply to the
phenomena of physics can be used here also, to explore evolution both in the
biological and cultural spheres.
Here Gell-Mann's ideas are at their most radical. They describe how the
evolution of adaptive systems works best in conditions poised between order
and disorder. There must, he says, be many places in the universe where the
chain of connections between simple and complex levels has produced
something similar to life on earth. But even so - and here, in the third
part of his book, he turns from science to politics - there remains an
urgent need to preserve as much of the biological diversity of the world as
possible; which will only happen, he says, if there is a major change in our
economic and technological lifestyles; for man and his world are ceasing to
be in adaptive relationship with each other, to the peril of both.
There is no environmental message in Kip Thorn's book, but it is equally
gripping. Thorn was one of the physicists who brought a weird and awesome
astronomical monster to the attention of an astonished world: the 'black
hole'. In his delightfully clear account he explains what black holes are
and relates the history of the scientific work which discovered them.
A black hole is a puncture in the universe exerting such a huge
gravitational attraction that it sucks in everything near it. Nothing that
slips over the 'horizon' of a black hole ever escapes, including light;
which explains the name. At the centre of a black hole is the remnant of a
star which died by imploding on itself. This tiny core is hugely massive;
space itself is warped by its gravitational pull, so even the nothingness
between the core of a black hole and its surrounding envelope of blackness
is a vast distorted twist of pure space.
The study of black holes is revolutionising scientific understanding of
nature. Thorn predicts that in coming years the results of investigations
into them will unlock the inner structure of matter - the same goal at which
Gell-Mann, from the different direction of nuclear physics, aimed in much of
his work.
Both these books give one the dizzying sense that science is poised on the
brink of a new world of discovery; a world stranger and still more beautiful
than anything imagined yet.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Outdoors: These long dry spells can make you go grey -
Gardening / Robin Lane Fox enthuses over the advantages of grey and
silver-leafed plants, particularly for hot summers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rain in southern England has stopped gardens from going grey. It has
also stopped me from going grey with them.
Long dry spells are horrible and for 10 weeks, we have had to look at burnt
sweet peas, brown phloxes and dead lower stems on those pillars of late
summer, the white-flowered Lysimachia Ephemerum and white veronicastrum.
Wherever I garden, the Good Lord makes it difficult. Six years ago, I
started to massacre Leyland Cypresses and to make a new garden over their
former home. Since then, we have had seriously dry weather in four of the
summers, sending me back to the old principle of suiting a new planting to
the soil and climate.
Even if it rains until October, I intend to think more in grey than in green
for the rest of the ground plan. Grey leaves like dry weather; they are
better in hot summers; they hold August together and this weekend, you can
save yourself a small fortune by multiplying them from cuttings, best rooted
now without any overhead watering or complicated equipment.
Grey and silver plants survive between two extremes: frost and damp. Some of
the most beautiful will not survive a serious winter; most of them hate a
wet soil or clay. The best guide to the extremes remains the late Mrs
Underwood's book, Grey and Silver Plants, first published by Collins in the
early 1970s.
I hesitate to call her an Essex girl, but she did grow, sell and select the
best of the greys and silvers in her nursery near Colchester and global
warming has yet to do anything to put her out of date. She grades the
possible plants on a scale of hardiness, but to the west of Oxford, I have
learnt to be less optimistic and add a further point to her grades, taking
no chances.
On the hardy side, new winners emerge as we all garden more sceptically. She
never fully discussed the silver oleasters, but they are the poor Briton's
substitute for those wonderful orchards of silver-grey olives which you are
envying or imagining this month in your Mediterranean dreams.
The Latin name for the family is Elaeagnus and it includes a superb
silver-leaved tree which is less familiar than the popular Silver Pear but
even prettier when the sun preys on its glistening leaves. The basic form is
Elaeagnus angustifolia, but nurseries have now selected one called
Quicksilver which is self-explanatory.
Its natural home is up in the extraordinary heat of the Caspian Sea area and
it will tolerate the awful stony and sandy soil of gardens near the seaside
or wherever I seem to settle. It is not a tree for screen and it is rather
bright. It is a feature which I would prefer towards a green boundary, but
it is an extremely good one.
In a smaller space, the best bet is the shrubby Elaeagnus commutata which
turns up as a centrepiece in artistic exhibits at Chelsea flower show. It
runs around by suckers and can be increased very easily by digging up a
rooted piece, it looks splendid on a dry bank, but its natural height is
slightly too tall for the middle of a normal border.
You can prune it, but you should do so after midsummer so that you do not
remove its particular delight - its scented little yellow flowers along the
joints of the stems in early June.
What other silver shrub flowers with a scent to equal a sharp lilac? This
small Oleaster has been one of the successes of this testing season and I
hope that many more gardeners will now try it, although it is not evergreen.
Among the smaller silver shrubs, I opt for the controversial curry plant.
Whenever you brush against it, it smells like an Indian dinner. Delhi
descends on the paved front garden and I am mentally transported to one of
those hot evenings, when the cows seem to have collapsed on the hillside and
their bones show through as if all air has been let out of their hides.
More prosaically, Helichrysum angustifolium is totally hardy, spreads to a
width of about two feet, covers itself in buds of an exquisite ivory-grey
and develops flowers of a strong mustard yellow which are somehow rather
sociable. I like the upright spiral of the young growth, the effect of
silver spires and and the dependability.
Curry-haters dislike it, but I put it first because it persists until the
outer edges of the bush go brown and it is time for very hard pruning after
flowering. It will multiply with ridiculous ease from cuttings.
Apply the two golden rules for propagation of almost every silver plant.
Pull off a stem which has hardened, rather than a soft little shoot from the
top of the bush. Take the cuttings now and leave them outdoors without
excessive watering.
They will root unless they become too damp, whereupon they rot. I find that
they are weekenders' easiest strike, because their owners are away from a
watering can for most of the week, allowing them to get on with it.
From the scent of India, I move westwards back to Greece. This month, one of
the few happy plants in the dust of the summer is the felted grey-green
Ballota with rounded leaves. It turns up in walls, on donkey tracks or on
bare landscapes by Aegean beaches. In Britain, it is surprisingly hardy in a
dry soil and I have kept plants of it since 1982.
Knowing gardeners nowadays chase after an apple-green form called All
Hallows Green, but I have left the stampede and am happy with the plain grey
pseudo dictamnus. It makes a bushy plant, especially if you clip it lightly
in early summer and it spreads charmingly in the front of any border,
improving as this summer has killed many of its companions.
The flowers and stems are a lovely accompaniment for small bunches of cut
pinks or summer flowers and they age gradually, becoming woody, rather than
dead. You can split them or root young growths with ease.
Nearer to the frost line, I must end with my star turn to date in this
difficult year. The silver-leaved Teucrium fruticans is not a certain
survivor in the open, but we have grown it in Oxford since 1983, where the
same old plants are flourishing in a dry bed against a south wall.
As a result, I recommend it wholeheartedly. It may look drab after a severe
winter, but you can cut it back in late April and it will regain its
elegance by midsummer and flower charmingly in a shade of pale blue which
persists on and off until autumn.
Be warned that the dark blue form is even more seductive, but markedly less
hardy. I like this shrub, up to 4ft high anywhere, but it has a particular
use which is invaluable. Usually, the windows of houses in the UK do not go
fully to the ground, and so we are left with a stretch of wall which is too
low for a serious climber.
Here, facing south or west, the Teucrium is in its element, although it has
the characteristic spread and slight untidiness which I value in parts of
the garden. If you are neat, smart and a perfectly-pressed sort of person,
you may find that it is too spreading if it survives for three or four
years.
If so, we disagree, because I believe that this wonderfully silver plant is
greatly under-used in southern England and in cities and that it is one of
the saving graces left to us after so long without serious rain.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Outdoors: The SL, a symphony in heavy metal - Motoring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 50-year-old Dakota, smelling like all old aeroplanes of petrol, oil and
the passage of time, had taken off from Biggin Hill airfield in Kent,
immortalised by the Battle of Britain. Close to an hour later, it rolled to
a standstill on the grass of Swanton Morley.
I jumped out, walked across to an open-topped Mercedes-Benz 320SL, and drove
it away down the kind of track makers use to test cars to destruction.
At 35-40mph (56-64kph), nothing shook, banged or creaked. For all the notice
the Mercedes took of the potholes and bumps, it could have been an average
B-road in Britain.
Why the trip by veteran aircraft to a former second world war bomber base in
East Anglia? First, to make the point that the SL has been around for a very
long time; the type name originated 40 years ago with the 300SL and its
unusual gull-wing doors.
Second, because the roads in East Anglia are almost traffic-free compared
with those of the overcrowded south-east. With the sun shining, it was just
the place for wind in the hair motoring.
The SL stands for superlicht (super-light) although, over many years, these
cars always have struck me as anything but. At close to two tons ready for
the road, the latest 320SL is a fairly massive piece of machinery; almost a
battle tank designer's idea of a sports car.
But its carved-from-solid integrity makes it the strongest, stiffest and
safest open car in the world. It even has a rollover bar deployed
automatically in a fraction of a second if a sensor detects that the car is
in danger of overturning.
This really works. When the present SL was launched five years ago in
Portugal, a girl who should not have been at the wheel up-ended one at speed
on a race track. The car looked distinctly second-hand afterwards, but she
and her passenger walked away.
To get an SL into such a predicament, however, calls for bad luck or inept
driving. Although it rides like a town carriage, its wide track and
sophisticated suspension give it levels of handling and road-holding so high
that they simply cannot be explored on the highway.
The SL has always been the choice of affluent motoring connoisseurs and
their ladies. Many of the owners are no longer young; indeed, it is the kind
of car to which a man might turn naturally on feeling he had grown too old
for a Porsche 911.
Although a cabriolet version of the gull-wing appeared in 1960, I reckon the
latest blood line began with the 'pagoda top' 300SL of 1963 - the one with a
slightly concave roof. Its replacement in 1971 stayed in production until
the present car appeared 18 years later, in 1989.
Since then, more than 106,000 have been made, more than half with
five-litre, V8 engines. Mercedes-Benz murmurs that this is because 'our
customers have a liking for power'. Britons, undaunted by the recession,
have bought more than 5,000 of them and sales now are even more buoyant.
SLs come with in-line, six-cylinder engines of 2.8 and 3.2 litres; the
five-litre V8; or a six-litre V12 at prices ranging from Pounds 53,594 to
Pounds 96,794. All have automatic transmission.
Orders are being taken for a very limited 'hot' edition with a bored-out
six-litre V8, special AMG suspension and ultra-wide wheels. It will cost
between Pounds 85,000 and Pounds 90,000.
I doubt I would like driving that one as much as I did the 320SL. This has a
silk-smooth six-cylinder (231 horsepower at 5,800rpm) which, I thought, gave
it more than enough performance. Foot down hard, the 308hp 500SL I tried
later was more rocket-like, but the extra weight up front made it handle
less sensitively.
All SLs have a power-operated hood and a hard top which you keep in the
garage until winter sets in. The soft top is a masterpiece. It disappears
completely when folded and is the only one I know that is totally automatic,
even to the operation of the clamps that fasten it.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Outdoors: Simply Itchen to seize - Fishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Self-doubt is an insidious infection, and two blank evenings on the Itchen
in high summer had left me seriously ravaged by it. As the second drew to
its maddening end - with the only trout I had managed to hook making its
escape into the weeds with my fly in its mouth - I wondered whether it might
all be beyond me. What made it worse was that I was alone in my failure.
A glance at the book in the fishing hut told me that everyone else had
enjoyed some measure of success. Were they all, I asked myself gloomily,
simply better fishermen than me? Probably, was the answer that hung heavily
in the darkness over the Hampshire water meadows.
My mistake had been to persuade myself there was only one place I wanted to
go. The fishery consists of a fairly short stretch of the Itchen itself,
with a criss-cross of interconnecting little streams. The other anglers had
prowled these streams, picking up a simple-minded trout here and there. But
I had skulked in one spot, waiting for something that never happened.
The Main, as it is known, is hardly classic Itchen. It was, so the
old-timers relate, subjected to barbarous dredging in the 1950s. As a
result, it tends to flow sluggishly over thick silt, unweedy and
unpromising. At the top of our stretch, though, the current is quicker, the
gravel is pale and exposed and the weed healthy. And there are trout there,
good ones - or, at least, there had been last year.
Supposedly wiser after my two fruitless evenings, I arrived for the third
determined to give the Upper Main a miss. So, at quarter to nine, in
blissful warmth with the sun sinking in a molten sky, I found myself on the
Upper Main.
It was not intentional. I had headed for one of the little streams, only to
find another fellow in occupation. I then tramped across to the Lower Main,
still fixed in my resolve. But there I met a deterrent.
Now, I have nothing against birds in moderation. A couple of coots, a duck
here and there, even the occasional family of swans - these I can view with
equanimity. With an effort, I can even forgive them their atrocious habit of
flapping around over proven trout lies, scaring every decent fish out of its
wits. But the Canada goose is another matter.
I counted 30 of these large, stupid and ridiculous birds. As I approached
one of the few promising runs from downstream, they sailed into it from
above. Round and round they went, while their chums hastened to join them
from all points near and far. Briefly, I savoured a fantasy in which the
rural idyll was shattered by automatic gunfire and the honking of wounded
geese. Then, I marched upstream towards the forbidden zone.
And there I came upon fish, feeding fish, and I was much amazed. For, on
those previous occasions, the trout had been engaged in some fishy ritual of
self-denial, abstaining almost totally from the tasty morsels which the
approach of darkness prompted to pass over their noses. Now, though, this
Ramadan had evidently expired. They were hard at it, tails and backs out of
the water as they slurped and guzzled.
Initially, I was not sure what they were taking, so I put on a little sedge
tied with cul-de-canard (feather from the duck's neck). This was grabbed at
once. I landed the fish, knocked it on the head and cast again. I was taken
again, and broken. I put on another sedge, of deer hair, hooked a fish and
lost it, rose another and missed it.
At this point, the community of fishes reached a consensus that it had seen
enough of me. It sank out of sight and I moved on, convinced I had blown it.
But around the next corner were even more fish, troughing away.
There was about half-an-hour of fishing light left - not a moment to be
wasted. They were not on the sedge, I knew; it must be the Blue Winged
Olive. So I knotted on an Orange Quill - which imitates the BWO on summer
evenings - and set about disrupting the gourmandisers' gala.
Innate modesty, and the horror of being thought tedious, compel me to skip
the details of the resulting display of dynamism and efficiency. I was the
embodiment of cool calculation.
Back at the hut, I bumped into the angler who had deflected me originally
from one of the streams. Nice fish, he murmured, as I tipped out my two
brace. Very nice fish. And they were, the two best reaching 2 3/4 lb.
As I skipped off down the path to my car, I heard a little warning voice.
Something, I think, about self-doubt being bad - but excess pride being
worse.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Property: Why bed and breakfast is just like getting married
 -So you want to take paying guests? Gerald Cadogan has a word with some old
hands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lambing comes early for Elizabeth Courage at Rye Hill Farm, Slaley, in the
wilds of Northumberland. 'The four legs must be out before the two legs
arrive at Easter,' she says.
The two legs are the visitors in the guest-house on her farm. As local
chairman of the Farm Holiday Bureau, she is eager to show them Northumbrian
farming. 'But most people aren't interested. They like being on the farm and
talking about it in the evening. Next day, one snoop at a pig is quite
enough - which takes all of three seconds.'
Running bed and breakfast accommodation is relentless work. But, by b&amp;b
standards, she has a large operation.
Six letting bedrooms, converted from old farm byres attached to the
300-year-old house, sleep up to 16 people. All rooms have a bathroom. She
charges Pounds 18 a person nightly for twin occupancy and Pounds 20 for
single.
Sandwiches will be prepared 'any time' and she cooks dinner. 'But you can't
do that without six eating, and you must charge Pounds 10 a head.' She also
has a self-catering cottage for nine, equipped fully for the disabled and
costing from Pounds 250 to Pounds 600 a week, depending on the season.
Courage cautions, however, that b&amp;b is like marriage - it should not be
entered into lightly: 'If you worked out your earnings per hour, they would
be worse than farming.' But it makes a great difference to her income and
being able to bring up four children. It is a relief, too, that the b&amp;b
operation is not run in her own house; otherwise, she would have little
privacy.
Most of her visitors are British but 10 per cent are foreign, mainly from
Australia, the US and the Continent. 'They even ring up from Vancouver, to
ask where we are,' says Courage.
Six beds above ground level is the cut-off point for fire precautions and
for paying business rates. She has had to install self-closing fire doors
and she is registered for value added tax, which has one advantage: she can
claim relief for the VAT she pays on fuel (which smaller, unregistered b&amp;b
establishments cannot). She feels the ideal size, in terms of effort
required and final income, is six beds or under.
She keeps chickens, a pit pony, 80 ewes and pigs. It is a hard-working
smallholding and, although the visitors do not like to be too close to the
muck, they like the feeling of being close to farm life.
Courage would not dream, however, of paying the Pounds 600 that it costs
Mary Pen Wills at Fulford House in Culworth, Northamptonshire, to be a
member of the Wolsey Lodge chain of guest-houses. She says: 'I went into it
because I wanted my own money to do up the house and buy more expensive
curtains than I could otherwise afford.'
Wills says she had the space as the children had left home. 'And I wanted to
stay in our nice house.' It is a smart, if rambling, old place near the
village green with smart curtains, antique furniture and fresh flowers.
Her visitors stay in the house. She agrees that it is hard work but it does
produce some money - although she adds, cautiously: 'If you employ help
every day, you begin to wonder.' She has three double/twin bedrooms and
rooms cost from Pounds 45 to Pounds 56 (Pounds 28 to Pounds 30 for single
occupancy), dropping a little in winter.
Dinner costs Pounds 17.50 and, like Courage, she has a residential licence.
'We want to make it a dinner party for them,' she explains. But when there
are only two visitors, 'we eat with them. And Stephen (her husband) pours
drinks while I finish preparing dinner.'
Wills says that when you look at b&amp;b prices, you must bear in mind that
Pounds 22.50 upwards takes you into the 'gracious' range. Among the costs of
being gracious are keeping the house warm all the time and making sure the
carpets are not frayed. 'But we cover ourselves and have had fun and can
afford new things.'
With some help in the house, she is able to relax playing golf twice a week.
If she did not have the help, income would be higher.
The Wolsey Lodge scheme, with central booking for overseas visitors, is a
reliable source of guests. 'It is a little club, really, and worth it.'
Properties in the scheme are substantial; many are manor houses and old
rectories. They are vetted carefully for what they (and their hosts) are
like, and what they offer. 'We want the sort of atmosphere where our guests
are coming to stay with friends, and will be meeting more friends,' Wills
explains.
This seems to work, because they have many repeats. 'It is like a house
party. We have delightful people. And if they do not look too delightful
when they arrive, they are when they leave.'
Many come every year for meetings at the nearby Silverstone race track.
Other attractions are Oxford, Blenheim palace, the Cotswolds and
Stratford-upon-Avon. There are many garden enthusiasts - hers is a good one.
Others discover Northamptonshire, a remarkably unknown and rural county. She
likes to help visitors plan their trips.
The Wills family has run the guest-house for eight years and she has no
regrets about the work, although she adds: 'It is a two-person job. I could
not do it without help in the evening from Stephen (an oil-field marketing
consultant). The husbands are excellent at the Wolsey Lodge meetings. They
leap up and ask questions. They love it.'

FT  20 AUG 94 / Sport: Time to cash in the goal futures - Football / Peter
Berlin asks economists about transfer fees' logic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This afternoon the big spenders of the English Premier League briefly put
their cheque books away and pull their boots on for the first match of the
new season.
The summer brought the usual riotous behaviour in the transfer bazaar.
Blackburn Rovers broke the British record when they bought Chris Sutton from
Norwich City. Sutton should play at Southampton today giving fans a chance
to assess where balance sheet and team sheet meet. But what do economists
make of the transfer market?
Kenny Dalglish, Blackburn's manager, paid Pounds 5m to Norwich City for
Sutton, a converted centre-half. He has played just one season at forward
and scored 35 league goals.
A few weeks later Tottenham Hotspur paid Pounds 2m, 40 per cent of the
Sutton price, for German striker Jurgen Klinsmann. Sutton's salary is
between Pounds 12,000 and Pounds 15,000 a week, plus bonuses. Klinsmann is
reported to be earning at least Pounds 15,000 a week. Sutton has not played
for England; Klinsmann has played more than 60 games for Germany, has scored
eight goals in the last two World Cups and collected a winners medal in
1990. Spurs paid for Klinsmann by selling Vinny Samways, a limited mid-field
playmaker, to Everton for Pounds 2.2m. Does this make financial sense?
Dr Stefan Szymanski, lecturer in economics at Imperial College management
school says football has an unusually efficient labour market.
'When you hire executives, you have very little opportunity to observe them
working on a day-to-day basis and see the effort they put in,' says
Szymanski. 'In the executive labour market there is very little correlation
between pay and performance.
'But every week 20,000 people see players work. The price they attract is a
pretty good reflection of the contribution they make. Players who command
high salaries are recognised as great players.'
The evidence, says Szymanski, is that spending money works. Clubs can buy
success. 'Position in the league is related to expenditure on wages and
transfers: 88 per cent of variation in position in the league is explained
by expenditure.'
'Of course you can make mistakes,' says Szymanski. 'Managers lose money when
they think they can beat the market, when they think they can spot a
bargain. When you spend intelligently you will do well. Dalglish was not
taking a risk when he bought Shearer (for Pounds 3.3m in 1992). He should
win the league on the basis of expenditure.'
There are other considerations, too. Age for example: Sutton is 21,
Klinsmann is 30. 'You have to say age comes into it,' says Dan Corry, senior
economist at the Institute of Public Policy Research.
'Turnover of players is still quite low,' says Szymanski. 'If all goes
reasonably well, you might expect Sutton to stay at Blackburn, whereas
Klinsmann's contract is unlikely to be renewed.'
Even if Sutton does not stay, he represents a sound investment, says Prof
Tom Cannon, of Manchester University and Manchester Business School. Sutton
is a goalscorer, like Shearer and is one of the few English players with the
potential to interest Italian clubs. If he were to go to Italy near the end
of his contract Blackburn could expect to reap a handsome profit.
There may be other costs for the clubs, says Kevin Gardner, UK economist at
Morgan Stanley. 'The cost of finance to clubs will vary. If you are a quoted
company like Tottenham there is an external discipline on you. With Jack
Walker (the club's owner) behind Blackburn there are lower implicit
financing costs.'
When playing in Europe, as Blackburn will be this season, there are limits
on the number of non-English players in a side. Buying Klinsmann would have
complicated matters for Blackburn, but not for Tottenham, who are not in
Europe.
Furthermore, Manchester United, the only team to finish above Blackburn last
season, have seven non-English first-team regulars. They must buy
Englishmen. Dalglish would have known that Sutton was one of the few players
United could pursue this summer.
Alex Ferguson, manager of Manchester United, had opened the transfer battles
by luring David May, an English defender, from Blackburn. Could Dalglish
have been aiming to hurt United and his other rivals with his cheque book?
For Pounds 5m he has got two players: the one who will play for him and the
one who will not play for United.
But, says Corry, that works both ways: 'Then he could have wasted money
twice: if he is useless you have wasted money and United would have had a
useless player.'
Pushing up the market makes sense, says Corry: 'If you have the cash why not
use it? You force the market up for everyone else.'
This increases the pressure on other clubs. As Simon Briscoe, economist at
Warburg Securities, says: 'Sooner or later there will be a British or
European super league. There is a desperate fear among clubs that they will
be left out.'
Cannon says football is unusual because many of its clubs, notably
Blackburn, Manchester United and Newcastle, are highly liquid. He says that
since Tottenham's disastrous attempt to diversify in the 1980s, clubs are
wary of straying from football. So transfers and wages soak up most of the
spare cash and the result is 'hyperinflation in the domestic market and
clubs look abroad'.
This is not a uniquely English problem. 'The prices move around the world,'
says Cannon. Three years ago, he says, the Italian league transfer fees
leapt up. Before that it was France, led by Marseilles and before that
Spain.
The only option for clubs who want to compete with Manchester United and
Blackburn is to match their level of spending.
'When you spend enough you should win the league,' says Szymanski. 'In
theory you should be able to calculate what it takes to buy the
championship.'
Football transfers, says Szymanski, work 'like a perfect capital market. All
the information is in the current price. That does not mean bad things, such
as injuries, will not happen.'
Briscoe disagrees. 'Perfect market theory does not help you understand why
Sutton is worth double the next person - there must be some imperfection in
the system. You cannot give these players points. Athletics is the exact
opposite - it is very clear who is the best in the world and who is the
fifth best.
'It is not clear what the secret of success is - and if someone found the
secret, football would cease to be interesting.'

FT  20 AUG 94 / Sport: The Foxes show some sharp teeth - Cricket / Teresa
McLean visits Leicester to investigate the year's surprise county
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESA MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Funny county, Leicestershire. I have never had much sense of its cricketing
character, except perhaps as a bit of the Midlands enlivened for a while by
David Gower, but basically quiet. This season their cricket, especially
their batting, has been more successful than in recent years. Their captain,
Nigel Briers, reached his 1,000 runs for the season last weekend, whereas
neither he nor anyone else in the county got 1,000 runs last season. Though
fragile in one-day matches, Leicestershire are a close second in the county
championship.
I am always reluctant to mention such things to county executives. Their
eyes light up and they release floods of favourable statistics about their
team. But Leicestershire have had a fine season which no one expected and I
did not blame their chief executive, Tony Norman, for his delight in it. He
attributed it above all to Phil Simmons, their West Indian opening batsman,
a clever replacement for fast bowler Winston Benjamin.
'He has charisma; a great team man,' said Norman happily from his balcony at
Grace Road last Saturday, as we watched Simmons dismissed for nought in his
second innings against Worcestershire. His batting has been variable since
its sensational start with a double century against neighbours and rivals,
Northamptonshire.
Last weekend his loose, impatient shots did nothing to improve his county
average of 42, but he batted, bowled and fielded whole-heartedly. He is a
tall, muscular man and a powerful presence on the field. He ia also a
good-humoured presence off the field, signing autographs, chatting and
joining in the club's many social events, everything from barn dances to
barbecues.
It will be interesting to see how Leicestershire fare with Hansie Cronje
instead of Simmons next year. By then Cronje will be used to English
conditions. At Leicester he has a brother-in-law, all-rounder Gordon
Parsons, who is enjoying an exceptionally good season. It was
Leicestershire's cricket manager, Jack Birkenshaw, who spotted Cronje's
talent while coaching Orange Free State in South Africa during the winter.
After Mike Turner, who ran the club, resigned amid great turmoil, Birkenshaw
was given what Norman described as 'a totally free hand in dealing with the
cricket side of things' and wasted no time in bringing his experience to
bear on the county's problems of mediocrity.
Last Saturday was 'former players' day at Grace Road. During breaks in play,
former players were introduced to the crowd one by one from an upper
balcony. The strongest applause went to recent wicket-keeper Roger Tolchard
and, above all, to Birkenshaw, who is a local hero. Such are the recruiting
and coaching skills of Birkenshaw and Russell Cobbs, who runs the new Grace
Road indoor cricket school, that this year Leicestershire have excelled the
exotic elements of other counties and boast a young Afghani player, Alangir
Sheriyar, in their second eleven. He is a 21-year-old bowler, born in
Birmingham, of Afghani stock.
In last Sunday's Axa and Equity Law League game against Worcestershire,
which Leicestershire lost by two runs, their best innings was the 53 scored
by 20-year-old Darren Maddy, with some strong, straight strokes. There was
quite a corps of young players; it looked as if Leicestershire were taking
the chance of the Sunday League to give them a taste of the big time.
I have never thought of Grace Road as a big-time ground. I have always found
it slightly forlorn and too spread out, with low rows of empty seats. Now
the smart new stand, which has hospitality boxes upstairs and the new indoor
cricket school below, fills in most of the open side opposite the pavilion.
New stand, new paint, new flowers dotted about - the only casualty is the
stretch of ground once free for childrens' cricket, which is much smaller
these days.
Grace Road is now Leicestershire's only home ground, because the county
found it made more money from its matches there than at other grounds, and
because, as Norman put it, 'no one in the county lives more than 45 minutes
away from Leicester, so we do not need another one'.
Closing outlying grounds is always a pity and though the reasons are
understandable they are bleak. The club have awarded groundsman Sol Spence a
benefit year this year, shared with Parsons - a thoughtful show of
appreciation by Leicestershire. The wicket last weekend was dry and its
high, flighty bounce helped the bowlers to take 13 wickets on Saturday.
On Monday, David Millns took six for 84, demolishing Worcestershire's second
innings and bringing his season's total to nearly 60, the product of
determined, accurate work. Alan Mullally, his opening partner, has done less
well but Vince Wells, like Parsons, has come into his own with both bat and
ball. Spin looks like Leicestershire's weak spot, but their mood is
confident and they told me they have great hopes of their young off-spinner
Tim Mason, a good England under-19 player, recovering from injury in time to
spin them to success next year.
What about this year?
Wells smiled when I asked him.
'Obviously everyone hopes for the number one spot. That is the aim you go
out with. I still believe you make your own luck, but you need a bit of luck
on the way as well.'
Before this season no one would have given Leicestershire a hope of
challenging for the County Championship, but they have worked hard at making
luck for themselves, throughout the club. Their sandwiches are grim. The
stuffed foxes looking down on the cafes and bars from glass cases are an
acquired taste. But the staff are friendly. The county has cut the cost of
membership and launched lots of events throughout the year for members.
Membership is larger and jollier and the cricket has prospered.
Wells, an import from Kent, gave me an inside view of the club: 'Here the
team are very much friends outside of cricket as well. Everybody sticks
closely together. Apart from Phil we have not got any star players and I
think perhaps when the going does get tough it is nice that we can get back
to that unit and put things in order. And anyway Phil is brilliant. He fits
into the side superbly. We are very lucky.'

FT  20 AUG 94 / Sport: Budgeting for a broken leg - Football / Jane
Whitehead shares pillow talk with West Ham's finance director
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE WHITEHEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last night I went to bed with the financial controller of a Premier League
football club. He had a headache, again.
It is 2 1/2 years since my partner, Richard Skirrow combined his
professional qualifications with his passion for sport. Relinquishing his
role of finance director in the unexciting adhesive tape industry in
Manchester, he travelled south to the allegedly twilit world of football
finance.
As a new season begins, I asked this down to earth, honest, Yorkshireman how
he finds life in a business so often tainted with tales of corruption, con
men and brown paper parcels bulging with cash.
'One big difference between this job and the 'real world', is that in
industry for instance, if you are going to spend Pounds 1m on a major asset
you would know exactly what you were getting for your money. You would set
the specifications, compare all the products available, and buy with a
warranty. In football you spend Pounds 1m on a player, and you get no
guarantee of a half decent return on that expenditure, definitely no
warranty, no replacement parts available and you cannot send him back.'
Last summer, Pounds 1.25m brought two new players to Richard's club West Ham
United. One, Simon Webster, broke a leg and has yet to play; the other, Dale
Gordon, suffered a knee injury and has managed only 10 games. Because of the
hefty premiums, neither was insured. Of this summer's Pounds 1.75m
purchases, one, John Moncur, missed the pre-season tour with an injury, the
other, Joe Beauchamp, decided he would prefer to play elsewhere and was sold
to Swindon on Wednesday.
'It is the unpredictability that makes life so fascinating.' says Skirrow.
'Take budgeting for a cup run, for instance. If you take the conservative
attitude and do not budget for any sort of cup success then you are in
danger of underestimating how much money you may earn. Therefore you do not
spend it, you do not buy the new player, you have a poorer side. It becomes
self-fulfilling and you get knocked out early on.
'Equally if you are tempted to budget for a long cup run and spend
accordingly you may still get knocked out in your first game, you have not
got that income you were expecting but you have already spent it on a player
and you are up queer street.'
West Ham do not have the luxury of a 'sugar daddy'. All spending money has
to be generated from trading profits and bank loans.
'We find the current level of players' wages crippling, but we have to pay
them because of market forces in the industry. Clubs such as Manchester
United, who are making money from huge crowds, frequent TV appearances and a
massive commercial operation, will, quite rightly, want to ensure they do
not lose their top players to European clubs, hence they will pay them a
phenomenal amount of money. To keep team spirit, the rest of the squad will
be paid well.
'Smaller clubs, who want to retain their star players have to pay comparable
wages. There are few clubs who can cope easily.'
There has been extra financial pressure on clubs to conform to the strict
requirements of the Taylor Report to make stadiums all seated.
'Most clubs have, in the past, spent money on the team first, and the
stadium second. Many fans, would far rather have a good team winning
matches, in average stadiums with indifferent facilities, than have a
spanking new stadium with piping hot soup and a team that is going nowhere.
But safety must be the priority and now football has been forced to spend
money on the facilities and it has been very expensive indeed.
'We received Pounds 2m grant aid from the Football Trust, towards the
redevelopment of our south stand. An immense help.'
West Ham's priorities are to have sufficient money to complete the ground
redevelopment, meet interest commitments and repayments on borrowings and
create some surplus for the manager to spend.
'You can set a certain figure for spending on transfers but then perhaps the
manager has spent it all and you still look as if you have a team that is
going to struggle, which is what happened last season. So you look at it all
again, try and be a bit more optimistic - bigger average crowds, an extra
round in the cup - and perhaps convince yourself the risk is worth taking.'
Income for clubs outside the Premier League is vastly reduced, so avoiding
relegation is becoming more and more important.
'Unfortunately the rich are getting richer and the poorer are falling
further behind. Even this league is geared to the successful getting more
financially rewards than those less successful.'
The Premier League TV money is split, in part, on a ladder principle. The
top club receives 22 shares and the club at the bottom gets one share. Each
share is worth Pounds 40,000. The top teams are more likely to be chosen for
live Sky TV games and a Pounds 70,000 fee.
The headaches? 'Bearable, so long as we are still in the Premiership this
time next season.'

FT  20 AUG 94 / Sport: In Jack's tracks - FT Ski Expedition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are attempting to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world expedition. They are currently in South America.
During our first visit to Portillo, Chile, in June, we had gazed longingly
at a run called Roca Jack but it had remained shut because of lack of snow.
On this visit, we awoke to find it knee-deep in powder after a two-day
storm.
Jack was British. In spring, he used to climb up to a rock on a steep
avalanche face, sit there, and marvel at the icy waters of the Laguna del
Inca stretched out beneath him.
Then, when the snow had softened in the afternoon sun, he would ski down.
Jack's rock is now immortalised as Portillo's most exhilarating lift-served
run.
And what a lift. The extraordinary contraption was built specially to serve
this steep, avalanche-prone chute: it comprises two sets of five Poma
platters harnessed together, one at the bottom of the run, the other at the
top, linked by cables suspended in mid-air and driven by an electric motor.
The five skiers have to hold on tight as they are whisked almost half a mile
up the mountainside at great speed. They come to a sudden halt at the top
and must disengage themselves backwards (very awkward on a steep slope).
On the way down, Jimmy Ackerson, the ski school director of both Portillo
and Heavenly (California), had the treat of making the first tracks, snaking
from top to bottom without stopping. Lucy and I floated, swam and finally
sank after him with tracks far more erratic. But we arrived at the bottom
elated.
When the time came to leave, our borrowed vehicle needed to be thawed out,
and, with dusk approaching, we set out on a spectacular drive across the
Argentine border and down the other side of the Uspallata Pass: one of the
most extraordinary journeys of our travels, through a vast landscape that
could have been in remotest Arizona or even Afghanistan.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Travel: Bitter truth behind a Bolivian beauty - Nicholas
Woodsworth visits Sucre, a charming town in the Andes. But four hours up the
road is one of the most hellish places on earth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is nothing, during a stretch of hard travel, like unexpected delight.
I had grown weary. My brain was joggled, my bottom numb. Who expects charm
and civilisation hidden in a fold of the Bolivian Andes hundreds of miles
from anywhere? The town of Sucre took me entirely by surprise.
What, I wondered, as I strolled into a sunny central plaza from the bus
station, could have provoked such elegant building so long ago in such a
distant place? For Sucre, even to the untrained eye, is a city of great age.
I spent an hour parked on a bench, relaxing in the balmy atmosphere of the
Plaza Veinte-cinco de Mayo. It is named, like so many squares and boulevards
in Latin America, after the outbreak of a revolution. Sucre's revolution was
no ordinary banana-republic bunfight, though. It was, in fact, the mother of
all Latin American revolutions.
On May 25, 185 years ago, a call to revolt rose from here that was to echo
across Spanish America. Taken up by the 'Great Liberator', the military
genius Simon Bolivar, it was to lead in a few turbulent years to the
independence of half the continent.
But it was not a dream of revolution that kept me sitting so long in
reverie. What absorbed my imagination, rather, were the remnants of
pre-independence Bolivia. From my bench I gazed out above the white walls
and wrought-iron balconies overlooking the plaza. Here, amid statues and
fountains, spires and towers, was a wonderfully mixed collection of colonial
architecture - everything from renaissance palazzi to baroque cathedrals to
neo-classical administrative buildings.
In fact, as far as Sucre is concerned, independence was just yesterday: less
then 50 years after Columbus sailed to the new world, the Spanish colonists
of Sucre were building San Lorenzo, the first of the city's 24 imposing
churches.
Sucre today is little more than a provincial town hidden away in a fertile
Andean valley. It was not always so. In the mid-1500s Phillip II of Spain
named La Plata, as it was then called, as his Audiencia - the administrative
capital of what today includes large parts of Paraguay, Argentina, Chile,
Peru and Bolivia.
By the early 1600s La Plata was accorded the theological autonomy of an
archbishopric; by the 1620s Spanish Jesuits had built the University of San
Xavier, one of the earliest in the Americas.
Sucre has been a sophisticated place of culture and learning for a long
time. It still is. I enjoyed strolling through monasteries, convents,
churches and palaces from the distant past. Equally, I enjoyed the
youthfulness to which Sucre's antiquity now forms a backdrop. Today the
biggest business in town is education.
Behind Sucre's white-washed walls, in delightful flowered cloisters and
courtyards, student life goes on apace. There are dozens of faculties,
institutes, seminaries, colleges and schools scattered about the town.
What could be more agreeable, I thought, as I strolled about the Plaza in
the cool of early evening? On the benches among palms and citrus trees
pretty, dark-haired schoolgirls in white uniforms sat chatting and laughing,
their books forgotten. In the cafes around the square groups of young men
and women ate, drank and whiled away the hours.
Young couples, oblivious to the world, strolled hand in hand past the
cathedral. I tried to imagine it all 300 years ago. It would not have been
that different. Learning was one thing, but Sucre was also a place made for
pleasure and relaxation.
One question still bothered me. What had kept it all going? What purpose did
colonial La Plata serve the Spaniards? You do not build a sophisticated
centre of civilisation on a distant continent hundreds of miles inland along
difficult mountain trails for no reason. The next day I asked Ivan Escobar,
a Bolivian Indian graduate student who was showing me the marvellous
green-tiled monastery of San Felipe Neri, to explain.
Like most Indians, Ivan - his militantly Marxist father gave him a Russian
name - is bitter about Spanish colonial history. 'Behind these tiles,' he
said as we stood in the bell tower and looked out over the sun-splashed
roofs of the city, 'are stone blocks from the mountain-side. They were
brought by Indians who were told by Spanish priests that each time they
brought a stone to build the church God would absolve them of a sin.
'But the Spanish did not come to relieve us of our sins. They came to
relieve us of our wealth. You have to look no further than the name of this
city to know how and why it was made. In Spanish, La Plata means silver.'
He turned to the south side of the tower and pointed to the high Andes.
'Four hours up the road is what is left of the largest silver mine in the
world. If you want to see the other side of Spanish colonial culture, go to
Potosi.'
In The Time Machine, HG Wells portrayed a world inhabited by two races of
humans. One spent its whole time in pleasant surroundings in the pursuit of
leisure; the other laboured unceasingly in horrifying workshops deep under
ground. Visiting Potosi after my stay in Sucre, I could not help thinking I
had entered Wells' world.
I arrived in Potosi late at night, filthy with the dust of untarred mountain
roads. At 13,000ft, Potosi is the highest city in the world, as bleak and
distant and uncomforting a place as you will encounter. Drizzle began to
fall and the thin Andean air was raw as I set off down long, empty streets
to find a hotel.
Great roughly-cut stone cobbles glinted in the light of occasional street
lamps. The houses on either side, their plaster facades stained and peeling,
were tightly barred and shuttered. There was still a shop or two open; under
weak light-bulbs dark-skinned Indian women sat huddled in blankets beside
mean little stocks of merchandise.
Once I tripped over a small child defecating in the gutter. Two drunks
stumbled by, dragging a third. By the time I found a room I was feeling too
desolate to inquire about dinner, but pulled the blankets over my head and
went to sleep.
From my window the next morning I could see the Cerro Rico - the Rich
Mountain - a great naked red cone of rock looming over the city. By 9am
Marco Mamani had assembled a small group of tourists like myself opposite
the thick-walled and fortress-like Moneda, the old royal mint, and off we
set for the Cerro Rico.
Marco now makes his living showing visitors over the mountain, but in the
past he worked there as a miner and knows the life only too well. Small
presents for the miners we would meet in the Cero Rico, he told us, would be
greatly appreciated. We stopped at one of the shops that line the steep
streets leading to the base of the mountain. Leaning against the walls and
piled in crates were shovels, pick-axes, helmets, rubber boots, hammers,
chisels and dozens of other implements of the miner's trade.
'What would you advise as a gift?' we asked Marco.
'Oh, dynamite and coca leaves are what they like best,' he replied. It
sounded quite a mixture. I bought six sticks of one and  1/2 lb of the
other.
If the 12,000 Indian co-operative miners who still work the Cerro Rico sit
outside and chew huge wads of coca leaves for an hour or so every day before
going to work, it is because the shafts and galleries and rock faces of the
Rich Mountain are too awful to face entirely sober. A great seething
ant-hill, this must be one of the most hellish places in the world.
Down we plunged into the bowels of the earth, Marco leading, we following by
the light of the lamps mounted on our borrowed helmets. The galleries of the
Cerro Rico are low and narrow, and lead up and downwards through 10 levels
at impossibly steep angles. Some of our progress required feats of alpinism,
the kind that requires diligent searches for toe and fingerholds.
Yet we passed men, bare-chested in the heat of the mine, hefting 100lb loads
of ore up these slopes. They use nothing but dynamite and the type of
primitive tools used in the Middle Ages; there is no mechanical equipment.
The biggest risks are invisible: silica dust, asbestos fibres, arsenic and
other toxic gases, acetylene vapours, the trapped by-products of mining
detonations. Silicosis is almost universal; the average lifespan of a Potosi
miner is 40 years.
And what is it all for? Today, the rich seams gone and the mine virtually
worked out, miners earn about Dollars 2 a day. For nearly three centuries,
though, beginning in the mid-1500s, the mine's production was legendary.
'I am Potosi, treasure of the world and the envy of kings,' read the city's
imperial coat of arms. By the end of the 1600s Potosi was the largest city
in the Americas, its population comprised mostly of mine slaves.
Many who made their fortunes in bleak Potosi lived in lush Sucre. The silver
mined here and minted at the Moneda was carried by llama-train down the
long, tortuous Camino de Plata, the Silver Road, to the Pacific port of
Arica. The silver not pirated by English buccaneers on its way home made the
wealth of the Spanish empire.
The cost in human terms was appalling. Indian and African slaves remained in
the mine for months at a time, eating, sleeping and dying underground. At
the bottom of the mine, Marco showed us a frightening man-sized bust of Tio,
the powerful underground devil whom miners propitiate with gifts of coca,
cigarettes and alcohol.
It is no accident that his face and beard are those of a Spaniard. It is
estimated that under Spanish rule 8m men died in the mines of Potosi. Today,
in recognition of its tragic history, the city has been recognised by Unesco
as a world heritage site.
A few days later, I was back in the warmth and comfort of Sucre. The 12
carved stone apostles on the tower of the cathedral appeared just as
splendid as they had before. The courtyards of the university looked equally
as pleasant. But I was not entirely at ease. I was seeing them in a
different light.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Travel: The desert is waiting - John Westbrooke sets out on
a camel in Morocco and discovers the real reason for visiting the sand dunes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WESTBROOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
M'hamid is the end of the world. The road peters out as it arrives; side
streets are no more than dusty alleys. The buildings are low and made of mud
brick. There is a hotel, but no water or electricity. Against the wall of
the last house in town, the sands of the Sahara pile up in waves.
M'hamid is Moroccan, and has seen use as a garrison town, but the borders in
this region are unfixed. Algeria is nearby, probably within 30 miles. In
truth, there is only nothing out there - all the way to the Nile.
We had set out, rocking wildly, on camels. Lolling along on big flat feet,
the animals bore no stirrups, which proved painful to our inside thighs
until their driver suggested we sit forward on the saddle, our legs crossed
around the pommel, our ankles resting on the dromedary's uncomplaining neck.
The ride was still bumpy, but less of a strain to underused muscles; this is
how the pros do it. Round our heads, to keep out the sun and dust, we
wrapped fine scarves.
After three hours of this and lunch prepared fresh in the shade of the only
tree for 10 miles, we were getting used to our mounts when our hosts decided
we were not going fast enough to see the real desert - the sand dunes - in
the limited time we had, and called up 4WD vehicles to take us to M'hamid
and beyond.
A few hours looking out of their windows demonstrated that even nothingness
comes in different varieties. Some desert is level and stony. Some is almost
green, with bushes holding hillocks of sand in their roots. Some is boring -
scrubby little plants that would not feed a camel, soft sand that slows
driving to a crawl, featureless flatlands under a clear blue sky.
The sun was fading when we arrived at the dunes, but sure enough, this was
the real desert, the way it appears in our dreams. Beyond the great,
shadowy, wind-driven curves of sand it was easy to imagine Lawrence of
Arabia, Ali Baba, Fort Zinderneuf, all out there somewhere.
The sky darkened, shooting stars hurtled overhead, the night became chilly.
While we huddled round a brushwood fire, our drivers whipped up another meal
on the spot: Berber bread kneaded and risen and cooked over hot stones,
salad, tajine (meat and veg baked in earthenware pots) and slices of orange
dusted with cinnamon, all accompanied by Moroccan red wine. Many visitors,
it should be said, also rate the local hashish as a tourist attraction.
At the end of a chilly but romantic winter evening (summer is impossibly
hot, spring and autumn are the best times to come), we went to bed in a
bedouin tent, fully-clad, under thick blankets, with a glimpse of the big
night sky through an open flap.
The next night we spent in the expensive Royal Mansour Hotel in Casablanca,
several hours' driving and flying away. Its comfort seemed like a mockery of
the previous night's austerity, but both are authentic aspects of Moroccan
life. The country's interior may be empty sands, but the coastal strip is
green and fertile, and home to the imperial cities of the country's gilded
Moorish past.
Casablanca is nothing like the film, which was shot in Hollywood. The
reality is a bright, white port city with - newly opened on the seafront -
the world's second biggest mosque after Mecca; unbelievers may not enter it.
The town has none of the movie's mystery.
In search of seedy nightlife we went to a disco. It felt like all the discos
in all the towns in all the world, circa 1972, except that boys danced with
boys and girls with girls.
Marrakesh and Tangiers are closer to the exotic Araby of our dreams, but
both are well used to tourists; you cannot even take off a lens cap in
Djemaa el-Fna square in Marrakesh without kids storming up and demanding
money. For a different experience, try Fez, perhaps the world's last truly
medieval city. A walk through its souks conjures up sights, sounds and
smells which must have existed in London 500 years ago. And it is still
startling to look at a map and realise that this headily oriental bazaar is
actually five degrees west of Greenwich.
Between the coast and the desert is a third Morocco, the land of the High
Atlas. There are three main passes through the mountains, good roads but
liable to closure during winter snows.
There were a few small villages, tinged red by manganese in the soil, with
women sweeping snow off the flat roofs, and scattered stalls optimistically
offering rocks and fossils to passers-by.
In the foothills on the eastern side, though, some of these hamlets are
spectacular, if forbidding. Tribal warfare meant until recently that towns
had to be more or less fortified, so the streets are often lined with blank
walls and overlooked by small towers. Standard procedure for besiegers was
to divert a river towards their mud-brick foundations and wash them away.
There are several such villages - called ksour - grandly situated in the
Todra and Dades gorges, but the most eye-catching we saw was Ait Ben Haddou,
just outside Ouarzazate. The houses spilling down the side of a small hill
are mostly empty and crumbling, but their roof lines are decked out with
machicolations like baby castles.
It looked like a Hollywood set. It was a Hollywood set. It has been used as
a convenient background in films such as Lawrence of Arabia, but that much
is common enough in Morocco: the kasbah (fortress) at Ouarzazate, for
instance, became a brothel in The Sheltering Sky; the walls of Essaouira
appeared in Orson Welles's Othello.
Part of Ait Ben Haddou, however, was actually built for the filming of Jesus
of Nazareth. This was good news for the locals, who could now afford to move
to a comfortable new village across the river. But for travellers it is a
depressing thought. You come all this way through the snowy mountains and
rocky valleys and you might as well be on the Universal Studios tour.
That, finally, is why you go out into the desert. Hollywood can build its
own kasbahs for Schwarzeneggers to knock down. Some Morocco Disney will one
day reproduce the imperial Moorish palaces, three-quarter size and cleaner,
with popcorn stands. But what showman could build the sands? For that you
need the wind and the sun and the hand of Allah.
John Westbrooke was a guest of Inspirations Morocco (tel: 0293-822244),
which offers city, beach, fly-drive and trekking holidays. A week split
between the coastal resort of Agadir and a camel trek with two nights in the
desert costs from Pounds 534.

You are about to choose between two premium brands of ice cream. One has an
odd name, is heavily promoted with advertisements dripping sexual innuendo
and the company is part of the Grand Metropolitan conglomerate, the chairman
of which is on the management committee of the Conservative Party.
The other ice cream is packed in a folksy tub, it is called Ben &amp; Jerry's
and it comes from 'family' farms in Vermont, in the US. Ben and Jerry (real
people) are multi-millionaire former hippies who listen to Grateful Dead and
give 7.5 per cent of their considerable profits to charities. Which do you
choose?
Shopping has become a nightmare for those with a social conscience. It is
especially hellish for those who see their purchasing power as a political
tool, used to bring about change.
Everything from clothes (Esprit and others), household goods (Traidcraft),
coffee (Cafe Direct), toiletries (Body Shop), DIY (B &amp; Q and others) and
meat and eggs (Freedom Foods from the RSPCA) are now promoted for being more
than just another product.
The problem was highlighted this week with the news that a US ethical
investment fund had recommended holders of Body Shop shares to sell before
the appearance of an article critical of the company's environmental claims.
But how do you know whether the assertions made in this
hug-a-tree-today-style marketing are genuine or particularly cynical
attempts to use our guilt to sell their products?
Attempts have been - and are being - made to come up with
universally-accepted environmental labels but progress is snail-like.
The EU launched an eco-labelling scheme last year but it has only agreed the
criteria for one set of products - washing machines. Plans to issue labels
for products including hair sprays, light bulbs, paper and soil improvers,
have been stymied by disagreements on the criteria, bickering between member
states and failure to promote the scheme.
The UK has stuck to the original plan to work with the European Commission
on a Europe-wide scheme, but other countries, such as France, are developing
their own national labels in tandem with the EU. Germany's Blue Angel label,
which existed long before the EU launched its scheme, continues to provide
the only wide-ranging set of labels within the EU.
The process of determining the environmental credentials of a product is
perplexingly difficult. Vast amounts of information about the product
(source of original materials, the production process, amount of energy
used, type of packaging etc) has to be collected and the environmental good
weighed against the bad.
For most products this balancing act demands subjective judgments on
weighting. For example, is a locally-made product (less transport) better
than one from abroad, even if the imported product is made with cleaner
technology?
The fashion business is finding it particularly hard to agree on what
fabrics are environmentally superior to others. For example, the belief that
natural products, such as cotton and wool, are better than synthetics may be
misguided.
The intensive farming of cotton is environmentally destructive because it
uses large amounts of water (the disappearance of the Aral Sea in the former
Soviet Union is largely due to cotton irrigation schemes). Large amounts of
insecticides and pesticides sap the soil of nutrients and often displace
much-needed food crops in developing nations. Processing cotton consumes
energy and pollutes the air and water. Much the same can be said for wool.
Oil-derived synthetics (nylon, polyester etc), it can be argued, might come
from a non-renewable resource and might need a lot of energy to produce, but
they cause less water pollution (because they absorb dyes easily) and can be
easily recycled.
Wood-based fabrics, such as viscose, are often trumpeted as environmentally
sound, but much depends on where the trees come from, how well the forests
are managed and how clean the production process is. There are no simple
answers.
Until an accepted labelling system is produced, all assertions should be
viewed with a great deal of scepticism.
Some recommendations:
CLOTHES. While the fashion business is one of the world's largest employers,
the production of clothes causes serious pollution and consumes many natural
resources. Problems include agrochemicals (cotton and wool), use of energy
and non-renewable resources (synthetics), pollution from dyes and chemicals
used in processing, emissions from energy generators, and the exploitation
of under-age labour.
Environmental and social issues now occupy an important position on the
business agenda of the fashion market, instigated mainly by innovative
companies who are genuinely responsible but who also see market benefits
from getting out in front.
Esprit, the fast-expanding Californian company has developed - through
genuine efforts - a sound reputation for being socially and environmentally
responsible. It has begun to integrate environmental issues into its design
and production, using organically-grown cottons, natural dyes, recycled
materials and clean technology.
Marks and Spencer might not promote its products on environmental grounds
but it does insist that suppliers conform to a range of strict
environmental, social and health criteria.
Other high-street names, such as Hennes, Next and Principles offer eco
ranges (such as unbleached cottons) and there are smaller companies, such as
Evolve and Disappearing Earth, which promote products on environmental
grounds.
Without an environmental audit, however, it is difficult to differentiate
between companies making genuine efforts to become environmentally sound and
those which are merely testing - or exploiting - the demand for green
products. Ask suppliers offering eco lines for their environmental policy
and evidence of its application.
TOILETRIESBody Shop sells natural cosmetics and toiletries worldwide. It is
easy to be cynical about this maverick - and sensitive - organisation that
behaves more like a pressure group than a traditional business. But even in
the light of the criticism made by a US ethical investment fund this week
Body Shop has shown that it is possible to be socially and environmentally
innovative and profitable.
Boots, while unable to compete with the Body Shop's overall image, is a
responsible manufacturer and retailer. Among large UK companies it has
pioneered a far-reaching environmental policy which affects all stages of
its manufacturing and retailing. It still has a long way to go, but Boots
has made far more progress in areas such as packaging, recycling and raw
material sourcing than its competitors in the toiletries sector.
HOUSEHOLD/GIFTS'Trading for a fairer world' is the motto of mail-order
company Traidcraft. Based in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, it sells goods from
developing countries. The company sources its stock for a fair price and
encourages entrepreneurial activities in undeveloped countries, similar to
Oxfam. Traidcraft offers three catalogues: paper and cards, alternatives
(clothing, jewellery and accessories) and interiors. (Tel: 091-491 0591).
COFFEESmall coffee producers - all in developing countries - are among the
most exploited groups of farmers, reliant on the unpredictable world coffee
market. Oxfam and other charities sell coffee direct through their stores
and health shops. But until now these efforts failed to win a wide enough
distribution. Cafe Direct was launched in 1992 by a group which includes
Oxfam Trading, Traidcraft and Twin Trading (tel: 071-628 6878). It has
managed to get prized space in most supermarkets.
DIY and TIMBERWood can be produced without damaging the environment.
Attempts are being made to introduce certified labels but progress is slow.
The World Wide Fund for Nature has signed up 24 companies in the UK who are
committed to selling timber and wood products from sustainable sources by
1995. B &amp; Q, Do-it-All, Homebase and Texas Homecare are among the WWF 1995
Group.
ANIMAL PRODUCTSThe RSPCA has launched a label called Freedom Foods,
guaranteeing that meat and egg products bearing it have been produced
following a strict animal welfare code. The label is on pork and egg
products in Tesco and the Co-op, but will be extended to more stores and
other products.
Finally, what is the right choice for the ice cream shopper? In the UK, buy
Loseley: it is just as good, if not better than, other products. It is
cheaper and it is made locally (no long-haul transport) with good
ingredients by a respected company. Some shopping decisions are just so much
easier than others.
New Consumer Briefing, published by New Consumer, researches the social and
environmental performance of companies. Subscriptions are Pounds 15 (Pounds
25 corporate) a year. Tel: 091-272 1148.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Fashion: The body as billboard and palette - Me and My
Wardrobe / Jane Mulvagh meets art consultant Fausto Calderai who dresses to
show clients his discretion and taste
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MULVAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imagine Art-World Man: surely a dyed-in-the-wool aesthete? Scrutinising a
Donatello bas-relief he is surely a veritable work of art in himself.
Perhaps he wears a three-piece suit in dove-grey, shot with lilac? It is cut
from a vicuna-mink super 120 cloth and its high waist is undoubtedly styled
a little too emphatically. His lavender silk shirt, buttoned in blonde
tortoise shell, is fastened at its promiscuous cuffs by links set with
Mesopotamian curios. His delicate, mauve-gloved fingers probably lean on a
cane carved from a narwhal tusk topped with a hand-painted glass eye.
Dream on] Sadly, the average Art-World Man cuts an unmemorable figure. In
spite of being surrounded by a richness of aesthetic stimuli, he tends to
subscribe to one of two visually bland dress codes: the formulaic
conservatism associated with lawyers and civil servants or the
thigh-slapping 'wit' of bond dealers and TV personalities who guffaw over
loud ties and conversation-piece cufflinks from Tiffany and Cartier.
Fausto Calderai, an art consultant in his late 30s, steers between the two.
His Anglepoise lamp figure is clad in matt wool and reminds me of the
centenary-celebrating images we have recently seen of Aldous Huxley's
beautiful attire. Calderai's sartorial efforts are widely acknowledged -
last year he was selected as one of the 'exhibits' in the self-laudatory
exhibition organised by the Italian fashion body Pitti Immagine, entitled
'One Hundred Years of Italian Male Elegance'.
Calderai's style communicates sobriety but not temperance. His slender,
dry-wool suits are easy on the eye and apparently unremarkable until closer
inspection yields pleasing details. The fine electric-orange thread lighting
up the grey cloth of his suit, like a kinetic flicker dancing across a flat
grisaille, and the shaved tufts protruding from his plain white cotton
shirts, are virtually undetectable as he strides by along Bond Street.
You will not catch him wearing a 'daring' Jeremy Paxman tie, or a 'novelty'
waistcoat. 'They don't work,' he says emphatically. 'They highlight a part
of your body when the whole figure should be a melange which is harmonious
to the eye. And if you're tall (more than 6ft 6in) they look ridiculous.'
His other pet hate is baggy clothes, on men or women.
Calderai runs a Florence-based art consultancy which offers independent
valuations. He advises, rather than trades and enhances his scholarly
reputation by occasionally writing articles and books on furniture made by
architects and artists.
His dress is extremely measured, for he regards it as an eloquent
communicator to his potential clients. He strives to project a balance
between discretion and aesthetics.
'The typical client wants a valuation on house contents which will be split
between the heirs, for in Italy we don't have primogeniture. As most of my
clients are afraid of academics and wary of dealers, they will turn to
consultants.'
Compromise between elegance and practicality is his goal. Passing many hours
in private homes, rather than public places, he must melt into the setting
and take part in their social occasions.
One moment he will be crawling on his hands and knees across a parquet floor
to inspect the underbelly of a table, the next scaling a step ladder to
reach a painting hung high up under the ceiling of a quattrocento palazzo.
Roomy pockets are essential for a lens, a measuring tape and a notebook. Dry
wools from English mills serve him well as they do not look shiny or creased
after a few climbing or crawling sessions, and he prefers their dated mood.
He loathes the faddish taste for cashmere - coats, jerseys, socks - which he
thinks are both impractical and expensive.
He keeps his luggage modest, for 'it would be considered far too vain to
turn up at a house with too many suitcases'.
Unlike British professional clothing, in Italy it is incorrect and
overdressed to wear a dark suit and black shoes in the morning, so Calderai
wears dry brown or grey suits, with a matching, high-buttoned waistcoat and
brown shoes for the day, and the same suit, with a low-cut waistcoat and
black shoes for dinner.
Most of Calderai's suits are made to measure by Di Preta whom he considers
superior to the better-known Italian tailor Caraceni because he prefers his
suits cut relatively close to the body and 'unstructured so they follow you
easily. I don't like very structured suits with big shoulders - like' . . .
sniff, sniff . . . 'those body guards you see in Los Angeles.'
He despises the florid and attention-seeking style of many, typically
Italian, art dealers. 'They look like shop window dummies aping London or
New York gents,' he says. He allows himself two areas of 'fantasy' - coat
linings and cufflinks.
Calderai's cufflinks are by and large costume jewellery rather than family
heirlooms: characters from Disney, lewd parts of the anatomy by Vivienne
Westwood, kitsch from the 1950s. Pride of place goes to a series of silicon
cufflinks made by the Spanish artist Joaquin Blanco in the shape of insects.
The delicate turn of his ankle is caressed by knee-high socks so fine that
you can almost count the freckles up his instep.
Calderai is also opinionated about women's wear. Emphatically out is the
modern taste for all-black: 'It can't be beautiful if 99 per cent of women
look the same. It's a kind of security and they all end up looking like shop
assistants which is rather sad.'
Other hates are big furs, though he is not an animal rights supporter, flat
shoes - 'so sad and unfeminine, don't you think?' - and the fad for going
about stocking-less in the city because 'I just think that a woman without
stockings doesn't care and looks dirty'.
His biggest criticism of Italian women is their taste for too much gold
jewellery during the day and 'those awful tailored gilt earrings favoured by
so-called smart Americans'. He loves feathers - 'a woman in feathers, wow]'
His advice for a young professional man starting out with a limited budget
is to seek good quality second-hand clothes and to have one or two well-made
classic suits.
'Have very few things. The most difficult lesson when you're young is to
stop buying bits and pieces - you need very few things. Only buy what you
really love and wear it all the time. I still wear the two suits I had made
when I started out - one of them is my favourite.'
There they hang, 18 years later, alongside a dozen others in his dressing
room which is styled like a faux-Regency shrine to external sensibilities.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Schools: From angst to anthropology - Marilyn Bentley looks
at the value of time-out after A-levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARILYN BENTLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For many British 18-year-olds, August is the cruellest month, when two As
can mean the difference between a course in anthropology and one in
advanced-level angst. It is no surprise that increasing numbers of
school-leavers prefer to take time out after A-levels, before the next stage
of their education.
The self-reliance and maturity gained in a well-spent 'gap-year' can stand
young people in good stead whether they go on to academic study or directly
into employment, and at 18 they can still afford to be adventurous.
Rosamund McDougall edits The Gap Year Guidebook (Peridot Press, Pounds 7.95)
and says: 'There is no question about the favourable response of
universities towards young people who have done something other than
straightforward school studies.' Her book gives a cross-section of
opportunities available for travel, short-term employment, voluntary
projects, and additional training, from the practical to the exotic, but
McDougall emphasises the importance of sensible preparation. Planning
effective use of the time requires application and, as with the selection of
a higher education course, it pays to begin researching early.
It is easy to be carried away by romantic images. Voluntary work in
developing countries and long-distance expeditions have a strong appeal to
the idealistic young, and some charities will make good use of student
labour.
Health Projects Abroad channels aid to Tanzania through a volunteer scheme,
on which students could find themselves building medical facilities,
bricklaying, or plastering alongside local workers. Volunteers are expected
to raise Pounds 2,450 in sponsorship money to cover travel, subsistence and
insurance, plus a contribution towards the programme.
Schemes such as this provide indelible experience for participants. But they
are not for the faint-hearted.
Regardless of the reputation of the agency or charity chosen, students must
do their own homework. McDougall also advises scepticism about environmental
expeditions to remote and sometimes hostile regions. Some organisations are
merely travel agencies offering thinly-disguised eco-tourism. The Expedition
Advisory Centre at the Royal Geographic Society, Kensington Gore, London SW7
publishes Joining an Expedition (Pounds 5), a helpful guide for those with a
genuine interest in fieldwork.
Studying French in Antibes sounds a more conservative option than protecting
African Pangolins in Zimbabwe, but it can pay dividends. Katherine Brand,
who runs Cultural and Educational Services Abroad, finds that gap-year
students are demanding longer language courses, with a recognised
qualification at the end.
Young people understand the value of languages as a core skill, and are more
serious about acquiring them. 'It used to be 'let's rush off to India','
Brand says. 'Now they want to study, not just for fun but to help their CV,
and because they won't have the chance to work on their languages until
after their main course of study.'
French is still by far the most popular option for native English speakers.
The Diplome d'Etudes de Langues Francaise, a public examination recognised
by the French Ministry of Education, offers an all-round grounding in French
and takes, on average, 12 to 18 weeks to achieve.
The diploma is made up of six unit credits which may be taken singly or in
combination at each examination session, and students who do not pass all
the units while in France can retake in the UK.
Using a gap year to enhance or acquire a skill can help finance travel later
on. Leith's School of Food and Wine runs cookery courses for people who want
to work in ski resorts, on yachts or in private villas.
There is a four-week beginners' course (Pounds 1,140) covering basic cooking
techniques, and more demanding courses of 10 to 11 weeks at beginners',
intermediate and advanced standard. They can be taken singly or in
combination.
The 11-week beginners' course (Pounds 2,575) would prepare someone for ski
chalet work. The intermediate level (Pounds 2,835) teaches more
sophisticated cookery and includes some experience of ordering, costing, and
cooking for large numbers. Students can also do placements in restaurants,
and work on large charity functions for 300 to 400 diners.
The advanced course (Pounds 3,000) introduces students to catering
management and service, as well as more exotic cuisine. There are practical
and written exams at the end of each course. The full year's tuition for
Leith's diploma in food and wine costs Pounds 7,500.
Young people are unlikely to encounter ski slopes or boeuf en croute through
Community Service Volunteers, but working for the benefit of the community
brings its own satisfaction. Volunteers may find themselves working in
hospitals, schools, or community projects, or assisting disabled people to
live in their own homes. They receive Pounds 22 per week pocket money plus
board and lodging.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Schools: A search in uncharted seas - John Authers on how
best to navigate the new university admissions procedures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you are about to put yourself through the clearing process to apply to a
university, you should first know the good news - statistically your chances
of getting a place are just as high as they would have been last year, when
admissions to UK universities were their highest ever.
The number of places available from universities will be almost identical to
last year, while the number of people applying appears also to be much the
same.
Overall, this year's A-level results suggest that the grades required to win
a place will be barely any higher than last year - the number of A-level
candidates dropped, by 0.4 per cent, but the proportion passing increased by
1.8 per cent, adding up to an increase in the numbers with grades good
enough for university.
The bad news is that you will have to navigate uncharted waters before
finally finding a place. And while the overall picture, as outlined above,
looks no worse than last year, the course which most interests you may well
have experienced a sharp increase in applications.
A brand new university clearing system is in operation - the Universities
and Colleges Admissions Service - which merges the old separate admissions
services for universities and polytechnics. For the first time, all degrees
and higher national diploma courses must be applied for through the same
system.
That means the tactics you need to adopt to get a place are slightly
different from previous years.
What are the changes?
Last year, UCCA, the old universities system, asked you to apply to up to
five courses, while PCAS, which covered the former polytechnics plus other
higher education colleges, allowed up to four choices. You could apply to
both, giving a possible maximum of nine choices. However, only 53 per cent
of candidates chose to apply through both PCAS and UCCA.
This year, UCAS allows eight choices, and the average number of choices by
each applicant is around seven. So universities have had to cope with far
more applications than last year, even though the number of people looking
for places is roughly unchanged.
How will it work out?
No one knows. But Tony Higgins, joint chief executive of UCAS, offers one
theory. He noted far more applications to institutions which ask for quite
difficult A-level applications, and 'very sizeable' increases in the numbers
applying for less-demanding institutions, such as colleges of higher
education.
The reason, he thinks, is that with a broader choice, applicants have
selected both the places they truly aspire to, and colleges which offer them
some 'insurance' of getting a place. As a result, some of the less
prestigious, but still excellent, universities may have more places on offer
for clearance than usual. But institutions which normally fill their
registers during clearance might already be full.
This phenomenon already seems to have changed the tactics of many hopeful
students. Advisers manning university helplines say that at the end of this
week they were receiving more calls than usual from people who had better
grades than their 'insurance' offer, and were interested in 'trading up'.
It would be unwise to assume too much. As Higgins puts it: 'Because there is
no historical precedent to work on, admissions tutors do not know how many
offers to make. In the past, they were able to get some idea of the ratio of
offers they had to make to the number of places available, bearing in mind
how many were likely or unlikely to meet the offer requirements. Now it is
getting close to guesswork.'
What should you do next?
This depends on how your A-levels went. If you satisfied the terms of your
first-preference offer (what UCAS calls the 'CF' offer) in full, or even
managed better grades than the university had asked for, then you have
nothing to worry about: the contract it made when giving you the conditional
offer is legally binding.
The terms of an 'insurance' ('CI') offer are equally binding. Note that the
obligation is both ways - technically the offer binds you as much as it does
the university, so attempts at 'trading up' would be unwise.
Life becomes more ambiguous if you have narrowly missed the A-level point
score your offers required. As many universities set high conditional offers
this year, they may well decide to take you after all. It is worth phoning
them, if you have not already done so.
Universities must send all their decisions on both CF and CI conditional
offers to UCAS by Friday this week. Barring postal delays, you should have a
decision by August 30 or 31, immediately after the bank holiday.
If the news is bad, and you still want to go into higher education next
year, then you will have to enter clearing.
What is clearing?
Instructions on clearing will be sent to all those without a place from
Monday onwards, and if you are eligible, you should have received all the
necessary documents, including the clearing entry form by the end of this
month. Vacancies definitely available through clearing will start being
advertised from Wednesday this week.
The form is vital. Having identified vacancies, you will need to contact the
university department concerned directly, either in person, if that is
feasible, or by telephone. You will need to quote your clearing number,
listed on the form, to prove you are eligible.
If the admissions tutor is interested, you must then send them your form. To
ensure that you are not being formally considered by more than one
institution at a time, you have to send them your original clearing entry
form, and not a copy. Again, ideally you should do this in person.
If you are unlucky, the clearing form will be returned to you, and you must
start the process again. Most university courses do not start until October,
so this could last a month.
It is hard to imagine a more stressful process, but 44,000 people
successfully won places through it last year, with the odds that even more
will do so this year.
Whatever happens, stay by a phone.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Food &amp; Drink: The glories of ancient fish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By OSWYN MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARCHESTRATUS: THE LIFE OF LUXURY. EUROPE'S OLDEST COOKERY BOOK Translated
with introduction and commentary by John Wilkins and Shaun Hill Prospect
Books, Pounds 7.99
No one has yet attempted a history of changing tastes. Products may vary;
sugar and potatoes and tomatoes may transform civilisations, but physical
sensations (we always assume) remain the same - and the decision about what
is pleasant or unpleasant to taste must be part of an unchanging world. Yet
what western traveller has learned to accept sheep's eyes or fermented
mares' milk as equal to caviar and champagne?
Even words mislead us: wine is not the same taste as it was 10 years ago,
and certainly not the same as medieval or ancient wines. Greek wine was
sweet and thick, so full of straws and sticks that it had to be strained;
there were no vintages or chateaux, and only the most rudimentary of
geographical appellations controles, as Archestratus, a Sicilian of the
fourth century BC, reveals.
The greatest luxury in ancient Greece was fish. Promising political careers
were ruined by the accusation that a man was a fish-eater - fish-eating was
a sign of extreme right-wing opinions. That is why Archestratus's book on
the life of luxury or pleasant sensations is all about fish.
This earliest of gastronomic guide-books was written in verse, as a mock
epic poem; it survives in 62 quotations from a gastronomic encyclopedia
compiled 500 years later during the Roman Empire.
In florid poetic style it describes where you can find the best of each sort
of fish from the Black Sea to Sicily and from the Adriatic to Asia Minor.
The author was a dedicated hedonist 'who sailed round the inhabited world
for the sake of his belly and the parts beneath his belly'.
Occasionally he mentions other flesh, such as hare and goose, but never the
great sacrificial meats such as beef, goat or pork. The world of pure
pleasure lies outside the civic rituals, in an area where indulgence runs
free.
The editors of this delightful translation, illustrated with charming
drawings by Philippa Stockley, are scholar and chef combined. They tell us
what fish is what, and how well the recipes will work. They even reconstruct
two sample recipes (dogfish with cumin and oregano, and grilled marinated
mackerel). But in spite of the grandiloquent claims of an author who
believes so passionately in self-indulgence and excess, we are left with an
impression of elegance, mixed with a certain abstemiousness; Greek luxury
seems pretty restrained.
Now the Romans, they were really gross.

The British branch of the Scotch Beef Club was launched in style. The sun
shimmered on the firth of Forth as we drove from Edinburgh to the venue,
Hopetoun House. There, we were greeted on velvet lawns by the skirl of
bagpipes and a gunfire salute of champagne corks.
The gala dinner was a multi-course affair. Apart from beef there was a natty
presentation of haggis: little timbales of the stuff served on beds of neeps
and tatties with a chive and whisky jus. The wines with dinner were a
splendidly generous selection which flowed as freely as the champagne
beforehand. A 17-year-old single malt whisky accompanied coffee.
I had forgotten how handsome the city of Edinburgh is with its wide, hilly
streets, surprise vistas and so much 18th and 19th century architecture; all
the more handsome now that many buildings have been cleaned or are in the
process of being given a facelift.
Clarissa Dickson Wright gave me a refresher-course tour and my first glassy
glimpse of the new festival theatre. Ex-Books for Cooks in London, now
Global Gourmet (tel: 031-221 1101) and mastermind behind the new bookshop at
Scobie Mackintosh's kitchen equipment emporium, she was the ideal guide.
How lucky the inhabitants of Edinburgh are to have so many good fishmongers.
There are more than 60, according to John Moore of the Sea Fish Authority. I
doubt that any other British city of the same size could boast half so many
that are half so good. George Armstrong, of Raeburn Place (031-315 2033),
has its own smokehouse at the back.
Not to be missed by those who love cheese is Ian Mellis, of Victoria Street
(031-226 6215), a young cheesemonger who ripens and sells only farm-made
British and Irish cheeses.
Mellis is passionate about his subject and knowledgeable. Tastings are
encouraged. The shop is small and cool with a creamily painted interior that
gives it the feel of a dairy.
The most compulsive shop of all, however, the essential stop-over if you
have time to visit one shop only, is Valvona &amp; Crolla in Elm Row (031-556
6066). I had heard that it was the best delicatessen in Edinburgh but it
struck me as the most exciting I had been to in any part of the British
Isles for many a year.
The small shop front and the window display unpromisingly filled with
miniature drink bottles in no way prepare you for the interior, which soars
to cathedral heights, with brightly coloured Lazaroni amaretti biscuit tins
hanging high up in the roof.
Seldom have I seen so many temptingly desirable foods packed into one place.
Scouring the shelves is what Christmas stocking dreams are made of. Upstairs
is a large room where wine tastings, talks and cookery demonstrations are
held.
Tucked behind the touristy frontage of The Witchery, near the Castle in
Castlehill, is The Secret Garden restaurant (031-225 5613). Built more or
less into the walls of Edinburgh Castle it is a good place to lunch.
Decorative, airy, neither too intimate nor too grand, it conveys a definite
sense of treat and the set lunch menu offers good value. The owner, James
Thomson, clearly enjoys the art of presentation and understands his market
well: bookings are consistently high throughout the year.
The Scots have a fine reputation for good plain soups and baking. Their
basic baked goods are unrivalled. Think of drop scones, oatcakes,
shortbread, Dundee cake, many sorts of bread and morning rolls.
Television presenter and food writer Grace Mulligan told me that in Dundee,
where she was born and brought up, morning rolls were delivered house to
house, just like milk and newspapers, in time for breakfast each morning.
Sadly this service is no longer available but Rough &amp; Fraser of Kinghorne
Road, Dundee (0382-825391) continues to bake morning rolls in the
time-honoured way.
The product is hand-made from hard wheat that is left to ferment for about
10 hours then baked at a very high temperature to produce a crisp crust and
very soft crumb. This is bread to eat within hours of baking (or to freeze
for eating later). These bakers still work through the night and the back
door of their premises is open from 11pm until 5am. You can watch them at
work and buy fresh morning rolls to take home for breakfast.
Scotland is famous for game, both feathered and furred. Grouse is arguably
the most exciting bird to shoot and the finest to eat. The more simply it is
cooked the better, yet so infrequent a treat is it for most of us, that I
thought it might be helpful to detail how to roast it.
To carry the Scottish theme through the whole meal, the grouse might be
prefaced by a wild mushroom soup or by ripe melon or figs and wafer thin
slices of Sara and Leo Barclay's Rannoch smoked venison (0882-632344).
Oatcakes, Bonchester and other fine Scottish cheeses would make an
appropriate finish.
ROAST GROUSE WITH BERRY GRAVY (serves 4)
Four fine birds; eight thin cut rashers of unsmoked streaky bacon or strips
of pork back fat; 2-3 oz raspberries, fraises du bois or blackberries; a few
slivers of lemon peel (optional); a good splash of wine or a few drops of
appropriately flavoured fruit vinegar; 8 fl oz stock; a little butter and
four fluted rounds of bread.
Smear the untrussed birds lightly all over with well seasoned butter.
Stretch the bacon rashers with the back of a knife, cut into lengths as
required and lay them (or the strips of pork back fat) protectively over the
breasts of the birds.
Secure the striped waistcoats with a criss-cross of string tied round each
bird. Slip the berries and a flake of butter into the body cavities, adding
a sliver of lemon peel if blackberries are used.
Lay the birds breast down on a rack in a roasting pan and cook at 425'F
(220'C) gas mark 7 for 12-15 minutes depending on size. Turn the birds over
and roast for 12-15 minutes more. Then strip off the waistcoats, baste the
birds once and slip them back into the oven for a final five minutes or so
until the breasts no longer feel soft and spongy when pressed with a
fingertip.
Using the handle of a wooden spoon, tip the berries from the body cavities
into the roasting pan. Then let the birds rest for 10 minutes or so in a
warm place, laying them on thick soft rounds of toast or fried bread spread
with the sauteed and crushed grouse livers.
Add the liquids to the roasting pan, scrape up the meaty sediment from the
pan base and crush the fruit into it. Boil up and simmer until reduced to a
few spoonfuls of fruitily gamey jus. Strain to extract fruit debris and
spoon the jus over the birds.
Serve with plenty of peppery watercress and game chips or potato sticks, or
bowls of creamy bread sauce and crisply fried breadcrumbs.
