FT  18 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: World Bank sees short-lived
commodity boom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The present surge in commodity prices is likely to be much smaller and more
short-lived than that of the 1970s, according to the World Bank.
In its latest quarterly report on Commodity Markets and Developing
Countries, the bank points out that circumstances differ significantly from
those of the 1970s.
The biggest difference is that the countries of the former Soviet Union and
eastern Europe, which were large commodity importers in the 1970s, now lack
the foreign exchange to fund high levels of imports.
The report also says that oil-producing countries in Opec, which were big
importers when oil prices surged in the 1970s, are now in a weaker economic
position.
Thirdly, it says, many developing countries which imported large quantities
of raw commodities such as grains when their incomes rose, were now
self-sufficient or even net exporters.
Nevertheless, the bank says certain commodities that have risen strongly,
coffee for example, may still have spectacular price increases to come.
'Coffee prices are expected to remain high for several years since recent
investments in new tree plantings have been low and the lag between new
plantings and production is long - new plantings take about three years to
begin production and eight years to reach maximum yields,' says the report.
'Thus significant production increases are not possible before 1997. Coffee
is poised for a significant price boom even if no further production
problems occur.'
It adds, however, that expected sharp increases in output by 1997 will lead
to a rapid drop in world prices, as occurred after 1977 and 1986.
The bank says its commodity price index will be driven higher by further
sharp rises in a few commodities that have been severely depressed, but that
nearly two-thirds of the 33 commodities covered are expected to show some
increase between now and 2000.
Cotton prices, driven up by 55 per cent between October and June by poor
crops in the major producing countries, are likely to remain high for 12 to
18 months, it says. World production should rebound in 1994, but disease and
pest problems will delay a full recovery in important cotton regions of
China and south Asia.
Oil prices are expected to remain firm for the rest of the year because of
relatively tight markets but prices could weaken significantly next year if
Iraqi crude exports return to the international market, the report says.
It argues that copper prices, up 45 per cent since November because of
stronger demand and a big reduction in stocks, should fall as new production
comes on stream in the second half of the year.
'More moderate increases in demand of 2-3 per cent a year are not likely to
absorb large production increases expected in 1995 and 1996.'
Grain prices should also be lower this year and next if yields return to
normal, since supply disruptions rather than increases in demand are
responsible for current high prices, the report says. But if yields are well
below average for a second year, further price rises will be on the cards.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Western Mining studies plan for
big expansion at Olympic Dam

<TEXT>
Western Mining Corporation, one of Australia's biggest mining groups, is to
begin a feasibility study into a major expansion of its copper, gold and
uranium mine at Olympic Dam in South Australia.
The company has been upgrading the mine operations during the past two
years, but the longer term plan is to double the size of the project. In
1993-94, Olympic Dam produced 56,684 tonnes of refined copper, 1,289 tonnes
of uranium oxide, 25,968 troy ounces of gold and 423,374 ounces of silver.
Current upgrading programmes costing the company ADollars 88m are expected
to increase production in 1995 to 84,000 tonnes of copper and 1,500 tonnes
of uranium oxide.
The South Australian government, which announced the feasibility study, is
holding discussions with the federal government to help ensure that the
expansion project goes ahead.
The South Australian economy stands to gain from the project as it is
expected that 50 per cent of the spending on supplies and manpower will be
in the state.
One issue that needs to be resolved is a proposed World Heritage listing of
the Lake Eyre region of South Australia. The Olympic Dam operations draw
water from borefields near the lake.

Atlas Consolidated Mining of the Philippines, which owns one of the biggest
copper/gold mines in the Far East, has shut down for four months and laid
off 3,000 employees, a union counsel said, Reuter reports from Cebu City.
Mr Pedro Rosito said management and the union had agreed on this temporary
arrangement pending the outcome of talks with Mitsubishi Corporation about a
financial rescue package for Atlas.
The company's mine in Toledo in the central province of Cebu was badly
damaged by a typhoon late last year.
Last month Atlas signed a deal with 15 local and foreign banks to retire
USDollars 104m of debt and Dollars 8.0m in interest and penalties. It
expects to see a Dollars 42.4m gain on its third quarter earnings from the
sale of power plants to the Toledo Power Company and the debt settlement.
Atlas said net operating revenues for the six months ended June 30 were
Dollars 10.3m compared to Dollars 38.1m. Net losses for the period were
Dollars 14.7m against Dollars 14.1m.
Atlas B shares are listed on the American Stock Exchange. The company said
it did not currently meet the exchange's listing guidelines and was unsure
if the listing would be continued.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian group gives up forest
rights worth Pounds 5.6m

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A British Columbia forestry company has relinquished its tree-cutting rights
over a vast tract of rain forest as part of industry and government efforts
to counter environmental pressures for tighter logging restrictions.
West Fraser Timber of Vancouver estimates that timber in the Kitlope Valley,
a scenic wilderness area 550km north of Vancouver, is worth about CDollars
12m (Pounds 5.64m). The decision affects 317,000 hectares of land that
contain a variety of wildlife as well as one of the biggest uncut rain
forests outside the tropics. Although only about 22 per cent of the area is
classified as productive forest, the large, old trees which grow there would
have an unusually high commercial value.
Logging the Kitlope Valley would have provoked fierce protests from
environmentalists as well as from the aboriginal groups that claim
jurisdiction over the area. Disputes over native land claims and logging
practices have led to violent confrontations in several BC forests in recent
years.
Mr Hank Ketchum, West Fraser's president, said that shareholders would
support absorbing the loss from Kitlope. But he said that the case should
not be viewed as a precedent.
West Fraser hopes that its gesture will encourage the provincial government
to set commercial harvesting targets. The industry has been pressing for
such targets, which would provide more certainty on precisely which forests
are available to be harvested.
But the BC government has also been under strong pressure from environmental
groups to ban logging in areas of old-growth forest, such as Kitlope, and to
enforce more environment-friendly tree-cutting practices. A number of
European paper buyers have responded to customers' concerns by imposing
boycotts on products from British Columbia.
The Kitlope announcement was timed for maximum public relations effect.
Queen Elizabeth is at present in British Columbia to open the Commonwealth
Games in Victoria later this week. Environmental activists plan to
demonstrate against local forestry practices during the games.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US partners in Kamchatka gold
venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Asarco, the US non-ferrous metals producer, is a member of a joint venture
partnership that has made the winning bid to develop a gold mine on the
Kamchatka Peninsula in the Russian Far East.
The partners, having bid less than USDollars 1m, expect to spend about
Dollars 30m to develop a mine that, from about 1997 onwards, will produce
160,000 troy ounces of gold a year.
Asarco and Grynberg Resources of Denver will each have 25 per cent of
Kamgold, a company set up for the project. The other half of Kamgold will be
held by Kamchatgeologia, a local Russian group.
Kamgold expects to receive a licence from the Russian government in October
to begin development of the Aginskoe deposit, located in the southern part
of Kamchatka, about 50 miles by road west of Milkova, a town with a
population of 12,000.
Asarco says that the deposit contains proven reserves of 1m tonnes of ore
containing an average of one ounce of gold per tonne and there is potential
for additional reserves.
About 52,000 metres of underground development and 160,000 metres of
drilling has already been completed by the Russians.
When completed, the mine will employ 300, most of them locals. It is
expected to contribute Dollars 17m a year to the local economy.
Kamgold will seek multilateral agency financing for the project.
Mr Richard Osborne, chairman of Asarco, says that his group has been looking
for investment opportunities in the Commonwealth of Independent States and
other parts of eastern Europe for some time.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee futures weaker - Market
Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Commodity Exchange COFFEE prices ended weaker in very light volume
yesterday after traders liquidated long positions in the absence of any
fresh factors.
'We lack any impetus on the upside and, as with other markets, when there is
a lack of news it tends to recede,' one trader explained.
At the London Metal Exchange COPPER led a general afternoon rally, but once
morning losses had been erased most contracts ran into resistance.
Markets were still rather thin and, in most cases, fairly light volumes of
business were moving prices, traders said. That may have given markets a
stronger appearance than was actually the case.
'Copper looked strong in the late morning and early afternoon but it all
fizzled out when we hit Dollars 2,420 a tonne,' one said. 'The same happened
to aluminium at Dollars 1,480 and nickel at Dollars 5,700.'
PRECIOUS METALS turned easier in the afternoon when follow-through to
Tuesday's rally failed to materialise.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Vancouver company is UK tin
mine's rescuer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The company that came to the financial rescue of South Crofty, the last
operating tin mine in the UK, was last night revealed as Crew Natural
Resources, a Vancouver-quoted company formed in 1982 by two Britons, Mr John
Darch and Mr Gerald Wright.
Mr Darch, 47, is a Dorset man with banking experience with the National
Westminster in the south-west of England and Mr Wright, 45, is an Ulster man
with a PhD in Water Resources Engineering from Queens University, Belfast.
Crew has acquired 60 per cent of South Crofty in the recent Pounds 1.15m
cash-raising exercise and, in due course, proposes to offer other South
Crofty shareholders the chance to exchange their holdings on the basis of
two Crew shares for every one of South Crofty. The company's name is likely
to be changed to South Crofty and it will attempt to gain a listing on a
more senior stock exchange, possibly London.
Mr David Williamson, the consultant who was instrumental in putting Crew and
South Crofty together (and who is a director of a Crew subsidiary) said:
'Those financial institutions wishing to have an equity exposure to the tin
market will now have the opportunity to do so.' He said South Crofty had
been starved of cash for many years and it was probable that Crew's
management would want to raise further funding for the long-term development
of the South Crofty mine.
Mr Williamson said Crew's long-term commitment could be judged from its
other operations - developing Canada's first geothermal energy project in
British Columbia and a potash deposit in Thailand and exploring for diamonds
in Botswana.
He suggested that a 'modest' rise in the tin price would return South Crofty
to profitability in 1995. It employs 260 people and produces about 2,200
tonnes of tin a year.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Government Bonds: Bundesbank worries erase early European
gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European government bond markets opened higher yesterday as traders
responded positively to the previous day's rise in US interest rates.
However, worries about the Bundesbank's intentions soon erased the early
price gains and many markets ended lower. 'The reaction to the Fed rate rise
has been transitory,' said one analyst.
The German central bank is due to hold a policy-making meeting today after
its four-week summer break. Dealers were unnerved by a German press report
suggesting that some Bundesbank council members were in favour of a rate cut
by September on the view that it would be justified by a further slowdown in
German M3 money supply.
Some analysts said a rate cut in Germany would be inappropriate against the
backdrop of rising interest rates on both sides of the Atlantic and the
stronger-than-expected economic growth in Germany. They added that the most
likely move from the Bundesbank would be a cut of 5 basis points in the repo
rate.
'The long end of the German yield curve would not like a rate cut just as
everyone is revising yield forecasts upwards,' said Mr Jouni Kokko,
international economist at S. G. Warburg.
He added that it was important for the Bundesbank to nurture its credibility
with the market in view of its large issuance programme. He noted that
yesterday's Treuhand auction of five-year notes was not a resounding
success, with only DM1.65bn worth allocated to the market and the Bundesbank
retaining a fairly large amount, DM1.35bn, for market tending operations.
On Liffe, the September bund future went as high as 92.42 but in late
trading it was quoted at 91.59, down 0.35 point on the day in volume of
155,231 lots.
In London, the UK government bond market continued to outperform its
European counterparts but early gains were also largely erased.
Long-dated gilt futures rose by as much as 1 1/2 points following news that
the July retail prices index was up 2.3 per cent year-on-year, below the
market's consensus forecast of 2.6 per cent.
However, analysts warned that such a good number had only delayed but not
removed the likelihood of a base rate rise.
The data caused the yield differential between 10-year gilts and bunds to
narrow by 20 basis points to 147 basis points, the low end of the current
range. Analysts said gilts would need a further boost to break below this
range.
On Liffe, the September long gilt future hit an intraday high of 102 but by
the late afternoon it stood at 101 7/16 , up  5/16 point on the day in
volume of 97,179 lots.
Longer-dated US Treasury bonds slipped yesterday afternoon when a surge in
oil prices prompted the market to give back some of the gains struck on
Tuesday's monetary tightening.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  3/8 lower at
101 7/32 , with the yield rising to 7.392 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was unchanged at 99 15/16 , to yield 6.140 per cent.
Bonds across the board held steady in the early hours of trading, as the
market sought to regain its balance after Tuesday's surge in prices at the
long end.
The rally had been triggered by the central bank's decision to lift two
short-term interest rates in an effort to slow the economy's rate of growth.
The move to boost both the discount rate and the Federal Funds target rate
by 50 basis points each - to 4.00 per cent and 4.75 per cent, respectively -
was welcomed by traders because it reinforced the Fed's credentials as
anti-inflation stalwart. In choosing the bold alternative - as opposed to
pushing up the Fed Funds target by a modest 25 basis points - the central
bank also signalled the beginning of a period of relative calm.
The subsequent surge in prices prompted some profit taking, holding bonds
across the board close to their opening values. However, a big rise in crude
oil prices began to tug at the market's inflation fears during the late
afternoon. As a consequence, the long bond was showing a moderate loss as
the session drew to a close.

FT  18 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Tax rate swap deal opens a
fresh vista - Derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Morgan Grenfell's completion - announced Tuesday - of what it believes is
the first UK tax rate swap agreement, for an international bank, may spark
fresh interest in the market for tax swaps. But it is a market that is
unlikely to become actively traded.
For any swaps market to develop, there needs to be some balance between the
number of counterparties with opposite views. For example, in the interest
rate swaps market, liquidity tends to dry up when everyone expects a rate
hike, because the prevalence of one view creates a dearth of counterparties
willing to pay a floating-rate of interest. In the case of tax rates, most
companies benefit when tax rates go down and suffer when tax rates go up, so
there is a lack of counterparties willing to take one side of the swap.
The Morgan Grenfell deal is unusual in that the counterparty in question
falls into just such a minority. Because of the structure of a specific
leasing transaction which provides the counterparty with tax benefits, the
bank in question would lose out if corporate tax rates fell.
'We have been looking for such a counterparty for five years,' said Mr Ed
Stacey, director of Morgan Grenfell. 'We haven't done such a deal before
because almost every counterparty suffers when tax rates go up. This won't
be an inter-bank market: there will only ever be a limited number of deals
put together.'
Those deals which do occur will be privately agreed. Companies are usually
unwilling to publicise tax-related deals because they do not want to appear
to be avoiding tax, or to attract the attention of the authorities to any
loopholes they may have found. However, because the Morgan Grenfell deal
involves a straightforward transfer of the risk of an increase in the tax
rate, there is no effect on tax revenues to the authorities.
The Morgan deal covers Pounds 15m of profits over a period of four years,
but does not start for a year, since a tax rate increase is only considered
likely if a Labour government were elected.
Morgan will have no trouble finding counterparties to take the other side of
the deal, but its small size means that the scope for further business is
limited.
Although the deal is something of a new departure, in allowing a specific
hedge against a tax change, it relates only to the lease. A hedge against
the full effect of a corporate tax rate increase on a company's
profitability is not on offer. The difficulty for banks in producing such an
instrument is in finding a way of offsetting their exposure, since there is
no traded market, such as bond or interest-rate futures as in the case of
interest rate swaps.
'I believe that derivatives will play an ever-increasing role (in hedging
tax exposure). There is no reason why a forward market in UK tax rates could
not be developed,' said Mr Richard Collier, lead tax partner of the
financial risk management group at Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
Whether explicitly tax-driven or not, the swaps market has always been used
by companies to provide tax benefits for companies.
Such deals are commonplace, although the details are kept under wraps.
However, the tax authorities are constantly on the look-out for such ploys.

FT  18 AUG 94 / International Bonds: Credit-card backed FRN issues to raise
Dollars 1.41bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The eurobond market yesterday saw the launch of several straight bond issues
in a variety of currencies and three asset-backed deals.
Merrill Lynch set two global US credit-card-backed floating rate note issues
for First USA Credit Card Master Trust: a six-year deal worth Dollars 539m
and a nine-year deal totalling Dollars 880m, with the longer-dated tranche
meeting with greater demand, according to the lead manager.
Most market players said they expected the bulk of the deals to be placed in
the US, but according to the lead manager, some 30 per cent had been placed
in Europe, citing typical FRN investors such as banks and money market
funds.
Kidder Peabody brought an unusual asset-backed deal backed by Mexican
tourism receivables. The Dollars 160m senior tranche for Seventh Mexican
Acceptance Corporation, is expected to yield 400-425 basis points over
Treasuries and targeted mainly at emerging market investors.
In the sterling sector, HMC Mortgage Notes, a special purpose vehicle,
launched a mortgage-backed deal in three tranches via Lehman Brothers
totalling Pounds 210m.
Elsewhere, Kellogg, the US food company, joined the recent stream of
Canadian dollar issuers with a CDollars 140m issue of 8 1/8 per cent
three-year bonds targeted largely at retail investors.
Although the issue was deemed to be aggressively priced, yielding 7 1/2
basis points over the Canadian government bond, the name attracted good
retail demand in Switzerland and the Benelux countries, according to lead
manager Lehman Brothers. 'It's a great name, and they're not a very frequent
issuer,' said a trader at another house. Kellogg also issued a SFr130m
private placement targeted at Swiss investors.
Elsewhere, the Kingdom of Denmark tapped the euroyen sector for Y50bn of
bonds in two tranches: a Y25bn issue of zero-coupon two-year bonds and Y25bn
of 3 per cent three-year bonds. The paper was largely targeted at Japanese
retail investors, according to Daiwa Europe, who were joint lead manager
with Fuji International Finance.
Finland was said to be poised to tap the euroyen sector today for
Y20bn-Y25bn of 20-year bonds, with Yamaichi tipped as lead manager.
In the Italian lira sector, Austria's OKB Bank issued L200bn of 11.35 per
cent three-year bonds. Lead manager Deutsche Bank said it identified retail
demand for lira bonds in Switzerland, the Benelux and Italy, in spite of
recent turbulence in the Italian bond and currency markets.

Continental Airlines, the fifth biggest US carrier, yesterday said it was
axeing nearly all its remaining flights out of Denver, Colorado, from the
end of October, including all but one of its six transatlantic flights a
week between Denver and London Heathrow.
The airline said it was dropping the routes because it had lost Dollars 500m
on them in the past three years and believed it could deploy its assets more
profitably in the east coast market.
Continental has been cutting its services in and out of Denver for several
months. At the beginning of the year it had nearly 150 departures a day.
From October 30 the number will fall to 22 a day, serving just four
destinations.
The cuts will be seen as a setback for Denver. The city has spent Dollars
3.2bn on a new airport, which has yet to open because its British-built
automatic baggage handling system cannot be made to work.

<TEXT>
Cray Computer, the struggling US supercomputer venture, has won a contract
from the US National Security Agency to develop jointly a very high
performance supercomputer.
Formed in 1988, Cray Computer is a spin-off from Cray Research, the world's
largest supercomputer company. Both were founded by Mr Seymour Cray, the
pre-eminent supercomputer designer.
The NSA will provide Cray Computer with its first revenues and ease a cash
shortage that threatened to force it to close. Cray has been seeking
strategic partners or investors, so far without results, and had
acknowledged that its funds would run out by the end of this year.
The contract may help Cray avoid the fate of Thinking Machines, another US
supercomputer company, which earlier this week filed for bankruptcy
protection.
Cray Computer will be paid up to Dollars 4.6m for development costs.
However, the company is responsible for the balance of development costs
which could total Dollars 9.2m. Most of these have already been incurred by
the company in the development of its prototype Cray 3 supercomputer.

Dissident shareholders who control less than 20 per cent of Goodman Fielder,
Australia's largest food company, said they had demanded an extraordinary
general meeting to review the composition of the board, Reuter reports from
Sydney.
The shareholders include Australian Mutual Provident Society (AMP), the New
South Wales State Authorities Superannuation Board, Bankers Trust Australia,
and Agrifood Australia, which is owned by Mr Doug Shears, a Melbourne
businessman.
The requisition proposes that the meeting consider the removal of seven
directors, including chairman Mr John Studdy, by separate resolutions so
that the position of each can be considered separately.
It also proposes the appointment of four directors.
On Tuesday, the rebellious shareholders rejected a plan by Goodman directors
to reshape its board as part of an effort to get the struggling company back
on track.
Goodman's plan included the appointment of two additional non-executive
board members and for Mr Studdy to stand down once an external successor had
been found.

Wesfarmers, the Australian fertiliser, chemicals and coal group, yesterday
reported a 88.7 per cent increase in profit after tax to ADollars 139.5m
(USDollars 102.6m) for the year ended June.
Sales, which rose 34 per cent to ADollars 2.3bn, were lifted mainly by the
company's rural trading operations and its fertiliser and building products
units.
The overall improvement in Australian agriculture and a large contribution
from Dalgety Farmers more than doubled the rural trading division's revenue
and contributed strongly to group profits.
The company forecast further growth in earnings as its expansion activities
and acquisition of businesses start to pay off.
It said it would spend about ADollars 200m on new capital projects.
The company's performance has lifted its earnings per share by 83 per cent
to 71.6 cents.

Japan Telecom, one of the country's three long-distance telephone operators,
yesterday announced a minimum bid price of Y2.41m per share for its 17,000
shares to be auctioned on August 25.
A further 17,000 shares will be sold in a fixed-price offering immediately
after the auction. This will include 5,000 shares to be offered to
international investors, the first equity issue in Japan to include a
separate international tranche.
The issue constitutes 9.9 per cent of the company's outstanding shares.
Japan Railways will remain the majority shareholder after the offer, with
about 50 per cent of the company's stock.
The minimum price represents a cash-call of at least Y819bn (Dollars 7.9bn)
and indicates a price/earnings ratio of 97, based on the company's projected
earnings per share for the year ending 31 March 1995.
The shares will debut in Tokyo on September 6.

FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: The Wharf improves 26% to
HKDollars 1.77bn at midway

<TEXT>
The Wharf (Holdings), the Hong Kong conglomerate controlled by the family of
the late Sir YK Pao, yesterday reported a 26 per cent rise in first-half net
profits to HKDollars 1.77bn (Dollars 230m) compared with HKDollars 1.38bn a
year ago.
The company is predicting a stronger second half on the back of a full six
months' rental from Times Square, its retail and office complex.
About 75 per cent of Wharf's profits are derived from property. Times
Square, which opened at the end of last year, yields about HKDollars 900m a
year in rentals.
The complex, in the prime shopping district of Causeway Bay, boasts 2m sq
ft, and is fully leased. Next year will be the first full year of
contributions, as tenants began moving in early in 1994.
The redevelopment of the Harbour City complex on Kowloon side is set to lift
second-half profits - tenants have started moving into Gateway I, the new
1.24m sq ft office and retail complex.
Mr Gerry Higginson, executive director, said developments due over coming
years, including 2.7m sq ft at Gateway II, a large shopping mall in Kowloon,
and the former San Miguel Brewery site, in which Wharf has a one-third
interest, would ensure robust recurrent earnings.
He said the government's attempt to cool the residential property market had
had no impact on the office sector, due to the continued rush of
multinationals and other blue-chip companies coming to Hong Kong. The best
example is Gateway I, where rentals have doubled since marketing started in
January.
The interim earnings include an exceptional item of HKDollars 243.3m, from
the sale of a Kowloon investment property. Turnover rose 60 per cent to
HKDollars 4bn from HKDollars 2.5bn in the first six months of 1993.
On a per share basis, earnings rose 23 per cent to 80.3 cents, from 65.2
cents. More modestly, the proposed dividend of 22 cents marks a 16 per cent
increase on 1993's interim 19 cents.
Earnings from infrastructure, including Modern Terminals Limited in which
Wharf has a 44.8 per cent stake, were strong and are expected to grow as the
group's second berth at the new Terminal Eight facility is developed.
Wharf retains ambitious plans for its cable TV network. It believes it can
sign up 250,000 subscribers by the year end, in spite of having only 100,000
now.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Spain's Telefonica group is set to reinforce its position in Argentina in
exchange for relinquishing one of its shareholding interests in Chile.
Telefonica Internacional, its foreign investment arm, said it had reached
agreement on the swap with Chemical Venture Partners, a unit of Chemical
Banking of the US.
Under the deal, worth more than Dollars 200m, Chemical Venture Partners is
to take over the Spanish company's 20 per cent stake in Chile's Empresa
Nacional de Telecomunicaciones (Entel-Chile) in exchange for a 4.33 per cent
stake in Cointel of Argentina and Dollars 46m in cash.
The deal is still subject to approval by the Chilean central bank and the US
Federal Reserve.
The reshuffle of interests in Telefonica's growing Latin American empire was
forced by anti-trust court decisions in Chile, which ruled that the Spanish
company could not hold stakes in both of the country's main
telecommunications concerns and must therefore shed either the 20 per cent
stake in Entel or its holding of almost 44 per cent in Compania de Telefonos
de Chile.
The deal will increase to 33 per cent Telefonica's stake in the Cointel
consortium, which controls 60 per cent of the operator Telefonica Argentina.
The state-controlled Spanish group, which has been discussing a link with
GTE as a shareholder in its international arm, also has interests in
Venezuela, Peru and Puerto Rico. It has been studying further opportunities
in Nicaragua. Bolivia and Ecuador.
Nestle, the food and drinks group, has reached an agreement with Banco
Bilbao Vizcaya, the Spanish conglomerate, for the purchase of BBV's ice
cream and frozen foods units, AFX reports from Madrid. No terms were
disclosed.
The Swiss group said BBV's food subsidiary Sociedad Anonima de Alimentacion
would sell its shares in the companies operating under Miko, Avidesa and
Castillo de Marcilla trademarks.

The acquisition involves the transfer of Cibaca toothpaste and other brands,
distribution and manufacturing arrangements.
Analysts said that with the acquisition of Ciba's brands of toothbrushes,
Colgate's market share will jump to 70 per cent. Ciba-Geigy is the market

Colgate said only 20 per cent of the Indian population uses any form of

rules

   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China said this week it was refining regulations to further liberalise
access to its equities markets. But foreign securities houses warned it
would take time to be completed.
Chinese stock regulators confirmed they were opening the way for local
investors to purchase B shares, reserved for foreigners. They were also
preparing guidelines to permit foreign institutions access to the A share
market for local investors.
China, in its efforts to bolster its equities markets, faces technical
difficulties broadening access to its A and B share markets in preparation
for amalgamation.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), the body responsible for
overseeing the markets, is grappling with the complex issues, including
levels of foreign ownership.
China said the new regulations would restrict foreign ownership of listed
companies to 35 per cent, but securities analysts warned the task of
monitoring ownership levels would present difficulties.
Several companies listed in Shanghai have floated more than 35 per cent of
their equity on the B share market. In the case of Dazhong Taxi, for
example, B shares account for 47 per cent. The bulk is thought to be in the
hands of foreign institutions.
China's plans to allow Sino-foreign joint-venture fund management
institutions to be established to channel funds into A shares will further
complicate establishing foreign ownership levels.
Access by local Chinese to B shares, under new categories of investors to be
approved by China's securities authorities, would add to difficulties of
assessing foreign ownership. B shares are denominated in yuan, but traded in
US and Hong Kong dollars.
Regulations permitting local investors access to B shares will be attached
to the corporate law which came into effect on July 1 last year. B shares
are being referred to in Chinese legislation as 'domestically-listed
overseas-invested stocks'.
China's stock regulators have considered a range of options to enliven the
country's flagging markets which lost more than 80 per cent of their value
between the high-water mark in early 1993 and July this year.
Measures announced late in July to lift the markets, including a freeze on
new listing and an injection of funds, sparked a rush in the first week of
August.
This resulted in the Shanghai A share index rising by more than 100 per cent
in the week before slipping back.
At the same time, the CSRC announced a target of UDollars 1bn in new B share
listings this year. Shanghai's B share index has strengthened by about 15
per cent since mid-year, after falling 40 per cent since January.

Oriental Brewery, South Korea's largest beer producer, suffered a loss of
Won19.8bn (Dollars 24.5m) for the first half of 1994, compared with a loss
of Won7.3bn a year ago.
This was due to increased competition and higher investment costs following
the expansion of production facilities.
The fall reflects a loss of market share, to 61 per cent from 70 per cent,
due to the introduction of brands by Chosun Brewery and Jinro-Coors, Korea's
two other breweries.
Chosun reported a 76 per cent growth in net earnings to Won2.2bn, primarily
due to the success of Hite beer, the country's first non-pasteurised beer,
which increased the company's market share to 33.6 per cent from 29.5 per
cent.
Ssangyong Motor, South Korea's fourth-largest motor vehicle producer,
reported a loss of Won34.1bn for the first half of 1994, against a loss of
Won19.4bn a year ago.
It blamed the deficit on heavy investment spending. Sales rose 135 per cent
to Won381bn as demand for commercial vehicles rose.
Ssangyong plans to enter the passenger car market in 1996 in co-operation
with Mercedes-Benz of Germany.

FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: WestLB down 7% after provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Operating profits at WestLB, the German state-owned bank, fell 7 per cent to
DM290m (Dollars 184.7m) after risk provisions in the six months to the end
of June.
WestLB, which is in effect the financial services provider to the state of
North Rhine-Westphalia, set aside DM565m to cover bad and doubtful debts, up
from DM550m in the comparable period of last year.
The bank group would achieve a satisfactory result for the full 12 months,
Mr Friedel Neuber, chairman, said in a statement issued yesterday.
Results reported in the statement were presented according to the
traditional German system, under which figures for the first six months are
compared with 50 per cent of the previous year's totals.
On a direct comparison, not provided by WestLB, operating profits rose
slightly from DM281m in the first half of last year, while provisions
climbed sharply from DM469m.
On the traditional basis, operating income before provisions was virtually
unchanged at DM856m.
In common with other banks, WestLB's earnings from own-account trading
suffered badly in the early-year turbulence in financial markets, dropping
from DM198m to DM33m.
Net interest earnings rose 5.5 per cent to DM1.6bn, while commission income
from financial and other services for customers stagnated at DM264m.
Reduced pensions provisioning and tight cost management reduced
administration costs 5 per cent to DM1.1bn.
The figures included the first-time consolidation of a 39.9 per cent stake
in Landesbank Schleswig-Holstein, which contributed to a 13.5 per cent rise
in the group's total assets to DM328bn. Excluding this factor, they
increased 4.6 per cent. No other effects of the consolidation were reported.

FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: Telebras falls 25% to RDollars
131m at interim stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Telebras, Brazil's government-controlled telecommunications holding company,
reported underlying consolidated profits after tax of RDollars 131.3m
(USDollars 146m) for the first half, down 25 per cent on the same period
last year.
This was in spite an increase in net sales of 12 per cent, largely due to an
increase in local telephone traffic of 7 per cent, and an increase in
long-distance calls of nearly 20 per cent.
Without providing details, the company said staff and depreciation costs and
spending on equipment and services had increased during the first half of
this year.
It added that its financial costs had been affected by the appreciation of
the yen against the dollar, which increased costs on a euroyen issue, and by
high local interest rates.
Mr Sergio Goldman, an analyst at investment bank Bear Stearn's Sao Paulo
office, said the results were weak considering the growth in telephone
traffic and an 8 per cent increase in the number of lines in the past year.

FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: Cost-cutting helps Puma move
back in the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cost-cutting programme at Germany's Puma sportswear group yielded fruit
in the first half when pre-tax income rose to DM17m (Dollars 10.8m),
compared with last year's loss of DM54.4m. Sales were up only DM2m at
DM240m.
Further improvements were expected in the second half, the company said
yesterday in an interim report.
Inventories and workforce totals tumbled while orders increased and the
proportion of just-in-time deliveries rose to 90 per cent from 45 per cent
in the first half of last year.
Interest charges also fell DM1.7m to DM4m, the report added. Total costs
fell 30 per cent.
Puma attributed a rise in orders on hand at the end of the reporting period
 -up 4.5 per cent at DM137m - mainly to retailers' enthusiasm for new sports
shoe ranges.
Meanwhile, stocks were reduced to DM74m from DM112m, and the workforce was
slashed from 1,110 to 736.
The company, controlled by the Swedish sports and leisure products group, AB
Aritmos, since early 1991, has staged a remarkable recovery following the
appointment of Mr Jochen Reitz as chief executive in April 1993.
Shortly after his appointment he said Puma would not return to profit until
1995. However, heavy expenditure on restructuring appears to have paid off.
The last German factory making football boots was closed last year, and now
most products come from east Asia.
Distribution costs have been saved by merging the brand's marketing with
divisions from other parts of the Aritmos group which make tennis equipment.
The sale of closed factories has also yielded undisclosed gains.
Restructuring costs accounted for DM60.5m of Puma's 1993 deficit of DM69m.

FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: Recovery in road transport leads
Nedlloyd turnround
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nedlloyd, the Dutch shipping and road-haulage group, swung into a net profit
of Fl 25m (Dollars 14.3m) in the second quarter of 1994 from losses of Fl
30m a year earlier.
The improved results take first-half net profit to Fl 35m, a reversal of the
Fl 116m loss posted in the first six months of 1993.
Nedlloyd said European road haulage, which until now had lagged behind the
steady improvement in ocean shipping, had seen a 'substantial recovery' in
the first half of 1994. In the second quarter, the sector posted a Fl 11m
operating profit in the quarter, compared with a loss of Fl 4m a year
earlier.
Ocean shipping extended the higher trend that first emerged in mid-1993,
with operating results swinging into a profit of Fl 35m from a loss of Fl 5m
in the 1993 quarter.
Group turnover in the quarter edged ahead to Fl 1.61bn from Fl 1.59bn.
The figures were at the lower end of analysts' expectations, however, and
Nedlloyd's shares fell by 9 per cent to close down Fl 6.40 at Fl 64.60.
The results were partly weighed down by the group's Neddrill operations,
which are suffering from a downturn in the offshore sector. The
'miscellaneous sector', of which Neddrill is the main component, broke even
in the second quarter after contributing Fl 4m towards group profit in the
same period of 1993.
For the rest of the year, Nedlloyd is cautiously optimistic about its road
haulage business, while for shipping it expects a continued rise in cargo
volumes, in line with the growth of the market. Cargo rates are expected to
remain stable in the second half.
Nedlloyd said that if the dollar remained at current weak levels,
second-half results would be 'adversely affected' compared with a year
earlier, but they will at least match the figures for the 1994 first half.

operating profit of DM734m

<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bankgesellschaft Berlin (BGB) expects to raise its dividend at the end of
the year, the board of management said yesterday. The current dividend is
DM9.
BGB, which was created last January following the merger of Berliner Bank
and Landesbank Berlin, reported consolidated operating results of DM734m
(Dollars 467.5m) in its first interim results. After taking into account
risk provisions totalling DM326m, operating results came out at DM408m.
The bank said that the risk provisions were 'very conservative' and were
targeted on small and medium-sized companies.
BGB's trading activities, following Germany's other leading banks, showed a
net loss of DM6m when compared with the consolidated accounts of the former
Berliner Bank over the same period last year.
However, BGB officials said the comparison with the Berliner Bank was only
for 'formal reasons' since no real comparative figures yet exist for the
BGB.
Administrative costs amounted to DM1.2bn and were largely the result of
setting up the group's new organisational structure.
The state of Berlin holds a 67.7 per cent stake in BGB, 10 per cent is held
by the Gothaer Insurance Group and the remaining 22.3 per cent is held by
minority shareholders. Its total equity capital is DM7.8bn.
In spite of its trading losses, BGB's main strength appears to be in
mortgage banking and real estate.
In the merger, BGB absorbed Berliner Hypotheken-und Pfandbriefbank and
Braunschweig-Hannoversche Hypothekenbank, both active in the property
market.
Consolidated business volume totalled DM222bn, compared with the DM71.4bn of
the former Berliner Bank group, and credit volume DM155bn, against DM52.8bn
over the same period.

FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: Kmart forced to float units
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kmart, the troubled US discount store group, yielded to pressure from
rebellious institutional investors and has announced plans to float off
three of its four specialty retailing subsidiaries on the stock market.
The three companies to be divested are OfficeMax, a chain of office supplies
superstores; The Sports Authority, a chain of sporting goods superstores;
and Borders/Walden, comprising the Borders book superstores and Waldenbooks
book shops.
The group's fourth specialty retailing operation, Builders Square, is not
considered a candidate for flotation because it does not make a profit.
Kmart has been forced into the divestment by its shareholders' rejection of
an earlier plan to create classes of Kmart shares tied to the performance of
the specialty retailers.
Kmart had hoped to raise between Dollars 600m and Dollars 900m by selling 20
per cent to 30 per cent of these shares without relinquishing control of the
subsidiaries.
Under the new plan, Kmart will sell at least 51 per cent of its shares in
three of the specialty retailers through initial public offerings, so
yielding control of the companies. An initial public offering of shares in
OfficeMax will take place in the next few weeks.
Kmart said it was confident the revised plan would win shareholders'
approval because it had discussed it with institutional investors.

FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: C&amp;W warrants issued by BZW
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BZW yesterday issued 25m warrants designed to facilitate an arbitrage
between the shares in Cable &amp; Wireless and Hong Kong Telecom, in which C&amp;W
has a 57.5 per cent stake.
Because of C&amp;W's exposure to Hong Kong, its share price tends not to fully
reflect the value of its other activities. These include its 80 per cent
stake in Mercury, the number two telephone services supplier in the UK, and
telephone franchises in the Caribbean, North America and east Asia.
According to BZW, C&amp;W's market capitalisation without HK Telecom is Pounds
0.9m. But it estimates that this non-Hong Kong business is worth a
capitalisation of Pounds 3.6bn (USDollars 5.58bn). BZW believes this
apparent 75 per cent discount could narrow to a 25 per cent discount.
Many investors regularly seek to realise the true value of C&amp;W by buying its
shares and taking out short positions in HK Telecom. By so doing they are
hoping that C&amp;W shares will outperform those of HK Telecom and therefore
make a profit.
BZW said its warrants simplify this process and also allow investors who are
not able to short HK Telecom shares to do likewise. Trading the difference
between the two shares through the warrant will also save on stamp duty,
commissions, stock borrowing fees and currency transactions.
The warrants, which expire in one year, had an issue price of 105p and were
trading at a mid-price of 112p yesterday.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Jyske Bank, the Jutland-based commercial bank, slipped into loss of DKr50m
(Dollars 8.09m) in the first half-year. This compares with a profit of
DKr378m in the same period last year.
Core earnings from interest and fee income rose to DKr1.14bn from DKr1.06bn
last year, but total financial earnings were hit by unrealised capital
losses arising from falling bond and share prices.
The market value adjustment for the value of securities and foreign exchange
was a negative DKr312m, against a positive DKr382m last year.
Loss provisions, however, were halved to DKr184m from DKr387m last year. The
total allowance for loan losses fell to DKr1.6bn, or 4.3 per cent of loans
and guarantees compared with 4.6 per cent at the beginning of the year.
Non-performing loans were reduced by 22 per cent to DKr1.2bn, said the bank.
The bank said it expected interest rates to fall from their high mid-year
level, enabling it to fulfil its forecast of a profit for the year of
between DKr200m and DKr300m.
However if interest rates remain at present levels profit will be cut to
DKr100m, the interim report stated.

   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the world's largest power engineering group, has
reported a 31 per cent surge in net income in the first half, to Dollars
322m. It attributed the improvement to lower personnel costs.
A 3 per cent rise in the Zurich-based group's order intake, to Dollars
15.5bn, indicated that recovery was under way in many important markets.
'Germany and the other heavy countries are starting to move now,' Mr Percy
Barnevik, chief executive, said.
Profits before taxes and extraordinary items jumped 20 per cent to Dollars
608m. Mr Barnevik indicated that earnings growth for the full year would
closely follow that trend.
He said the full impact of the upturn in investment goods 'will not be felt
until next year'.
Revenues in the first half were flat at Dollars 13.1bn, dragged down by a
10.5 per cent slide in income from European Union countries, to Dollars
4.44bn. Revenues from other western European countries, mainly the group's
manufacturing centres of Switzerland and Sweden, were up 1.5 per cent to
Dollars 2.57bn. Revenues from Asia, Australasia and Africa, meanwhile,
jumped 12.3 per cent to Dollars 3.2bn. Revenues from the Americas rose 2.4
per cent to Dollars 2.6bn.
Operating income climbed 19 per cent to Dollars 1.12bn, mainly because
personnel expenses dropped Dollars 147m to Dollars 4.37bn. All divisions,
except financial services, had improved earnings.
Mr Barnevik said the group continued to shed labour at a brisk pace, with
4,000 jobs lost in various operations in the first half. On the other hand,
2,500 people were taken on and 6,000 were absorbed with acquisitions.
The trend, he said, was to reduce employment in high labour cost areas, and
increase it in eastern Europe and Asia. However, there was no plan for
further large-scale rationalisation in western Europe.
The group's order backlog stood at Dollars 32.3bn at the end of June, 9 per
cent higher than a year earlier. Mr Barnevik said the order intake in the
first half was up 6 per cent in local currencies. He stressed that that
figure represented real volume growth, as price increases were rare.

FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: SAS emerges from the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Scandinavian Airlines System emerged from a long period of losses yesterday
to report a pre-tax profit of SKr617m (Dollars 79.1m) in the first six
months of the year, against a deficit of SKr609m in the first half of 1993.
The jointly-run Danish, Norwegian and Swedish airline confirmed an earlier
forecast that it would make its first full-year profit for five years this
year, in spite of heavy restructuring costs and a change in its accounting
of depreciation charges.
Sales rose only modestly, to SKr19.28bn from SKr18.95bn, but operating
income in the first half swung from a loss of SKr145m last time to a surplus
of SKr615m. A 12 per cent increase in air traffic revenues, and lower
operating costs, offset a SKr311m increase in depreciation charges and
restructuring costs of SKr274m.
The pre-tax result also benefited from a net exchange rate gain of SKr130m -
after a SKr425m loss last year - and a capital gain of SKr374m from the sale
in May of SAS Leisure, the tour operator, to Airtours of the UK.
The SAS Leisure sale was part of a radical restructuring to cut almost 3,000
jobs and SKr3bn in costs. It was undertaken following the collapse last year
of the Alcazar project, an ambitious plan to merge SAS with Swissair,
Austrian Airways and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.
SAS said it also completed the sale on August 1 of SAS Service Partner, its
catering division, to Gate Gourmet International, Swissair's catering
division, for a capital gain of SKr270m. It is also selling Diners Club
Nordic, a credit card operation, to Sweden's Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken
for a capital gain of up to SKr200m. That sale will be completed in the
third quarter.
At the halfway stage, net debt had been reduced by SKr3.9bn to SKr9.95bn.

FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: A lesson in risk management -
Results from top Swiss banks raise doubts about trading strategies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All good things come to an end,' the chairman of Union Bank of Switzerland
wrote in a surprisingly jaunty opening to the group's interim financial
statement two weeks ago.
Still, it set the tone well for an unexpectedly bad set of first-half
results from the big three Swiss banks, with all reporting substantial
double-digit declines in profits.
On the common basis of profits before taxes and provisions, the UBS result
was down 28.6 per cent to SFr1.97bn (Dollars 1.5bn); Swiss Bank Corporation
was down 45.1 per cent to SFr1.19bn; and CS Holding, the group built around
Credit Suisse, was off 30 per cent at SFr1.97bn.
These results are not dire - all three still achieved returns on equity
above 6 per cent and have capital ratios comfortably above BIS standards -
but they raise uncomfortable questions about the volatility of some streams
of income, and about the limits of the much-touted sophisticated techniques
of risk management.
The main cause of the profit slides has been big declines in income from
trading - the money the banks make from dealing in foreign currencies and
trading in bonds, shares and other securities for their own account.
UBS was hit hardest, with a 68 per cent plunge in trading income to SFr493m.
SBC was not far behind with a 63 per cent fall to SFr537m. CS profit on
trading was down 43 per cent to SFr1.27bn.
The banks said they had particular trouble with bond and other interest rate
instruments, confirming that, like many other investors, they were caught
wrong-footed when interest rates rose early this year.
However, it is obvious that some were more wrong-footed than others. Some
analysts were less than happy that the banks were so willing to attribute
their setbacks to 'a difficult environment' (UBS) or 'financial market
turbulence' (SBC).
The banks have, in the last few years, been emphasising the use of futures,
options and other derivative products to manage the risks in securities
price movements.
SBC, in particular, has invested heavily in this area, acquiring the
Chicago-based O'Conner Partners derivatives business. However, it does not
seem to have done as well in controlling its risks as CS: its Credit Suisse
Financial Products subsidiary, which also specialises in derivatives,
matched its strong performance in the first half of last year.
The banks also plead that their trading profits in the first half of this
year look particularly bad compared with the extraordinary combination of
positive forces that came together in the first half of last year. The chart
(right), however, suggests they do not compare well with any six-month
period in the past two years.
One question being asked in Zurich is whether this sort of earnings
volatility in a business that now accounts for a substantial proportion of
the Swiss banks' overall profits is consistent with their high credit
ratings.
For UBS, the only Swiss bank which still has triple A ratings from all
international agencies, the answer appears to be 'yes'. The group says it
felt that, with the exception of the first half of 1993, the swings were
within tolerable limits.
A related question is whether the banks should be paying out huge
performance-related bonuses to traders who just shrug their shoulders and
blame unfavourable markets when things go wrong. The implication is that if
things go right, it is more because of favourable markets than due to their
performance.
Still, the banks were all helped in the first half by the disappearance of
performance-related bonuses.
Personnel expenses were down nearly 12 per cent at CS, due to more incentive
compensation at its CS First Boston subsidiary. At SBC, staff costs were
down 5.5 per cent, and at UBS there was a 4 per cent decrease.
Meanwhile, the three continued to suffer to a surprising extent in the first
half from squeezed margins on their basic lending business. Net interest
income was well down at all three.
Some Swiss bankers had hoped that the competitive frenzy for business in the
domestic market would ease when CS acquired Swiss Volksbank last year, but
it obviously has not. Mr Hans Kaufmann, head of Swiss brokerage research at
Bank Julius Baer in Zurich, notes that there are still more than 100 small
regional banks in the country, many of which are weak and desperate for
business.
Also, according to some reports, the Volksbank takeover sparked off a
discreet market share tussle among the big three themselves.
Looking on the bright side, some analysts believe the bad figures in the
first half and the recent slide in the banks' share prices mean things can
only improve.
Until now, the only case being advanced for an earnings recovery was that
bad debt provisions would continue to fall. The three all made substantial
cuts in their provisions in the first half, and both CS and UBS held out the
prospect of more in the second.
'An operating improvement from this level is feasible,' Ms Madeleine Hofmann
of Credit Suisse said yesterday. Mr Kaufmann, too, said the risk of further
big losses in bond markets, or thinner margins on lending, in the second
half, seemed small.
Still, Ms Hofmann yesterday took the rare step for a Swiss broker of putting
out a sell recommendation on SBC.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Elkem, the Norwegian light metals producer, more than doubled profits in the
first half but its shares fell 6 per cent on disappointed market
expectations.
Pre-tax profits amounted to NKr139m (Dollars 18.1m) for the period, compared
with NKr61m a year ago. The market had been looking for a NKr175m profit and
marked the company's shares down NKr5.50 to NKr79.
The company has been unable to take full advantage of rising aluminium and
silicon metal prices because of forward contracts.
It has suffered from reduced production due to maintenance and upgrading
work and from high prices in the short-term power market.
Net sales rose to NKr4.41bn from NKr3.78bn. Income from operations increased
to NKr243m from NKr218m while profits from associated companies climbed to
NKr40m from NKr29m. Net financial expenses fell to NKr144m from NKr186m.
The company says the underlying trend in its main markets is positive.

FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: Dutch group buys H&amp;C food units
for Pounds 81.6m

<TEXT>
BolsWessanen, the Dutch food and drinks company, yesterday captured 10 per
cent of the growing Pounds 1bn (Dollars 1.51bn) European breakfast cereals
market with the purchase of UK and French food units for Pounds 81.6m from
Harrisons &amp; Crosfield, the UK conglomerate.
BolsWessanen is buying Telford Foods and H&amp;C Cereales, suppliers of
own-label corn flakes, rice crispies and other cereals to supermarkets in
the UK and France. The group is paying H&amp;C Pounds 74.4m in cash and taking
on Pounds 7.2m in debt.
The deal will give the Dutch company about 50 per cent of the European
market for private label breakfast cereals, estimated to be worth about
Pounds 200m a year at factory prices.
The Dutch company's existing business claims about 4 per cent of the
European market for breakfast cereals. Sales of the enlarged company were
expected to total about Fl 300m (Dollars 167m) a year.
Cereals operations have performed well for H&amp;C and heavy investment has
helped the division win substantial business in the private label market in
the UK and France. The UK is the largest single European market for
breakfast cereals, consuming about 57 per cent of the 675,000 tonnes eaten
every year, or about 7kg per person.
However, the potential for own-label breakfast cereal in Europe has
attracted increasing competition and led to the beginnings of a price war.
This was a factor in H&amp;C's decision to sell the business, said Mr George
Paul, chairman.
H&amp;C has raised more than Pounds 250m through disposals in the last month,
following the sale in July of its Indonesian plantations for Dollars 273m.
Yesterday's disposal is expected to dilute H&amp;C's earnings, although this
would be slightly offset by the tax position, the group said. H&amp;C is likely
to finish this year with net cash for the first time in many years. H&amp;C is
expected to seek acquisitions in the UK to build up its chemicals and
building supplies businesses.

35%
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITT, the US conglomerate which owns the Sheraton hotel chain, has increased
its stake in Ciga, the Italian luxury hotels group, from nearly 26 per cent
to 35 per cent with purchases on the depressed Milan stock market.
Consob, the Italian stock market watchdog, late last month asked the US
group to launch a formal bid for further shares in Ciga. However, to the
annoyance of other Ciga shareholders - which include a number of Italian
investment funds - it is still unclear what the price or timetable of such a
bid would be.
Consob said yesterday it was up to the US group to decide on the terms. It
said it was in 'informal talks' with ITT representatives, and expected the
US group to make an official decision shortly.
ITT said: 'We are complying with the takeover regulations and final details
will become public as appropriate.'
ITT made clear that it had control of Ciga at a meeting of the Italian
company's shareholders last month, after nearly six months of financial
manoeuvring.
Since then, the US group has continued to increase its stake on the market.
It has also appointed three members to the seven-person board, and indicated
it is looking to acquire at least 50.1 per cent.
Ciga shares yesterday closed at L1,046, down L21. At that price, the company
is valued at just over L1,000bn (Dollars 628.8m).

<TEXT>
Varig, Latin America's largest airline, has proposed offering board seats to
McDonnell Douglas and General Electric in return for their help with its
financial restructuring.
The Brazilian carrier said it had signed letters of intent with the two US
companies to restructure its payments to Eximbank of the US for aircraft.
Varig owes Eximbank more than Dollars 600m.
A single board seat will also be given to Varig's Brazilian creditor banks
and one more will be decided by Varig, McDonnell Douglas and General
Electric. The other five board seats will remain under Varig's control.
Varig said the proposals did not involve changes in the shareholding of the
airline, which is controlled by an employees' foundation.
General Electric has agreed to buy Varig's six Boeing 767 aircraft, which
had been purchased with Eximbank funding, for Dollars 204m. Varig will
continue to use the aircraft.
McDonnell Douglas, which had sold Varig four MD-11 aircraft, will pay the
principal on the debt for the next 18 months, totalling Dollars 72m, while
Varig will continue to pay the interest. Varig's repayment period for the
Dollars 400m debt for the McDonnell Douglas aircraft will then be extended
and include the payments made by McDonnell Douglas.
Varig has been restructuring after losing Dollars 300m in 1992 and Dollars
97m last year on sales of about Dollars 2.5bn.

FT  18 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Raine raises Dollars 40m for US building
offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Raine, the UK housebuilder and contractor, has raised Dollars 40m (Pounds
25.8m) through a US private placement to help reduce the currency exposure
of West Venture, its Californian subsidiary.
The placement, arranged earlier this week by NatWest Markets, replaces a
Dollars 35m borrowing facility which was due to expire this year.
Funds from the placing will be held by the UK parent group, which oversees
West Venture's spending on its programme of building starter homes.
In the half year to December 31, the Californian housing operation reported
losses of Pounds 605,000, against profits of Pounds 819,000 previously.
Mr Peter Parkin, chairman, said the use of more structured financing would
considerably assist the subsidiary's longer term development.
The issue of 8.7 per cent guaranteed senior notes to Teachers Insurance &amp;
Annuity and John Hancock Mutual Life also marks a partial shift in strategy
from reliance on relatively short-term borrowings to more medium and
long-term finance.
It follows the group's decision last year to take on a 5-year syndicated
loan for Pounds 50m.
The two deals are expected to reduce Raine's dependence on borrowing
facilities maturing within one year. Last year such borrowing represented
Pounds 85.1m of the group's total facilities of Pounds 196.6m.

FT  18 AUG 94 / UK Company News: USM Texon close to flotation - Reducing
debt of Pounds 93m seen as priority for shoe materials group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
USM Texon, the Leicester-based manufacturer of shoe materials and
manufacturing equipment, plans to go public in the near future to reduce its
Pounds 93m debt burden and provide greater freedom to exploit growth
opportunities.
No date has been set, but Mr John Foster, managing director, said that
'everybody is feeling that the time for an exit is near'. The company was
created in 1987 as the result of a Dollars 115m (Pounds 75m) management
buy-out from the former Emhart company of the US.
Mr Foster would not say what value the flotation would put on the company,
the world's largest producer of shoemaking machinery. But, with consolidated
turnover last year of Pounds 179m, the stock market launch would be a
substantial deal and a full listing.
Timing would depend on market conditions and the development of a suitable
financial record. The company's machinery business is emerging from a
difficult period caused by recession and the collapse of east European
markets; overall, it lost a total of Pounds 13m in 1991 and 1992.
It returned to the black last year with pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.7m.
Profit would be higher this year, said Mr Foster, and would rise again in
1995. Orders in the machinery business had risen dramatically since April.
The debt burden, which is about 70 to 75 per cent of capital, stems mainly
from its Dollars 100m takeover in 1990 of the Texon footwear materials
business. The annual interest bill, now running at Pounds 8.5m, delayed the
restructuring of the machinery business, involving the closure in 1992 of
its factory in Frankfurt.
Mr Foster believes the world shoe machinery market, of which the company has
a share of about 19 per cent, could recover from the current Pounds 250m a
year to Pounds 350m by next year, returning to the 1989 level.
The machinery business is benefiting from the company's development
programme, which has transformed the product range over the past five to
seven years through the use of proprietary software. 'None of our
competitors has gone as far on elec-tronics as we have,' Mr Foster said.
The less cyclical materials business is also developing new applications for
its technology in air filtration and medical products.
Mr Foster said there were opportunities for USM Texon in east Asia, where
demand for machinery is growing as western shoe manufacturers seek more
consistent product quality. The materials business has already set up a 60
per cent-owned joint venture in Foshan, China, to make cellulose.
The company has discussed the planned flotation with a number of City
merchant banks and Mr Foster said institutions, which own 89 per cent of the
shares, 'won't be holding us back'. The remaining 11 per cent is held by
management.
USM Texon was called United Machinery Group until 1991. It will have to be
renamed again when it goes public, to avoid confusion with the Unlisted
Securities Market.

FT  18 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Maple Leaf Foods expects to show modest
expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The lingering effects of the recession are still holding back Maple Leaf
Foods, but Canada's biggest food processor expects to report modest profits
growth for the full year, said Mr Brent Ballantyne, president.
Maple Leaf, 56 per cent owned by Hillsdown Holdings of the UK, reported
second quarter net profit up from CDollars 16.9m to CDollars 17.9m (Pounds
8.3m) or 22 cents (20 cents) per share.
Sales rose to CDollars 798m (CDollars 742m).
First half profit declined from CDollars 27m to CDollars 25.9m - 32 cents
(33 cents) per share - on sales of CDollars 1.46bn (CDollars 1.37bn).
Mr Ballantyne said he expected difficult trading conditions to continue for
the rest of the year. However, he anticipated that the company would show
modest growth for the year.
Maple Leaf is concentrating on new products and marketing improvements,
besides further cost reductions and heavy capital spending in its main
businesses.
Agribusiness and bakery operations were strong in the first and second
quarter, said Mr Ballantyne, but the consumer foods business contributed
less, reflecting strong price pressures and tight consumer budgets.
The cost reduction programme includes moving a high-cost Toronto meat
processing plant to new facilities in smaller centres.
Interest income for the second quarter was lower than last year as a result
of lower cash balances - down from CDollars 215.4m to CDollars 128.9m - but
analysts expect Maple Leaf to use its remaining substantial cash resources
to make acquisitions.

FT  18 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Rea Brothers declines after losses on bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bond portfolio losses of Pounds 854,000 hit Rea Brothers, the private
banking group which yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 621,000,
down from Pounds 802,000.
However, the group recorded strong growth in income from corporate finance,
trust and fund management operations, and showed confidence in its core
activities by proposing a 0.2p increase in the interim dividend to 0.5p.
Dealing contributions turned from a Pounds 500,000 profit to a Pounds
736,000 loss for the six months to June 30, reflecting the provisions
against its Pounds 7m fixed interest securities portfolio.
The losses were flagged in a profits warning last June, but the overall
results were better than expected and the share price rose 3p to 66p.
Sir John Hill, chairman, said Rea had now 'substantially hedged' its
portfolio following the impact of a drop in bond prices of more than 10 per
cent earlier this year. He said the group was confident that such provisions
would not recur.
Fee income rose by Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 5.52m, reflecting an upswing in
corporate finance activity, including Hobson's purchase of the Co-operative
Wholesale Society's food manufacturing business.
The fund management division increased funds under its control by 7 per
cent, in spite of declining equity markets, while the trust division
reported a 17 per cent increase in gross income.
However, there was a fall in interest income from the banking division to
Pounds 1.88m (Pounds 1.91m), reflecting the competitive market for deposits.
The company has settled legal proceedings against a defunct Rea Brothers
pension scheme for an undisclosed figure, which was within provisions of
Pounds 300,000 for its settlement made in 1993.
Earnings per share amounted to 1.13p (1.42p).

raise IPounds 2.9m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Glencar Explorations, the Dublin-based mineral exploration company, is
making a IPounds 2.94m (Pounds 2.9m) share placing and open offer.
The move is being carried out to fund an increase in Glencar's equity
interest in the Wassa project in Ghana and its other exploration activities.
Glencar is placing 6.36m new ordinary shares at 33p each, of which, subject
to certain conditions, 5m will be placed with Bermuda-based Emerging Markets
Gold Fund. The 1-for-10 open offer, if fully subscribed, would result in the
issue of 2.55m shares.
Assuming the offer is fully subscribed, EMGF will hold about 14.5 per cent
of Glencar's enlarged equity and will be entitled to appoint a board
representative.

Rosebys, the household textiles and soft furnishings retailer, yesterday
announced an 8 per cent rise in pre-tax profits in its less favourable first
half.
On turnover ahead 11 per cent to Pounds 24m (Pounds 21.6m) and after a
Pounds 75,000 charge as compensation for loss of office, pre-tax profits for
the six months to June 30 improved to Pounds 738,000, against Pounds

Mr Roy Waudby, chairman, said, however, that trading continued to reflect a
'patchy' economic recovery. Sales growth was attributable to new store
openings in the last 12 months.
The interim dividend is 1.5p (1.4p), from earnings of 2.4p (2.3p).

FT  18 AUG 94 / UK Company News: United Newspapers pays Pounds 27m for
picture library
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
United Newspapers, the publisher of the Daily and Sunday Express and a range
of regional newspapers and business magazines, has paid Pounds 27m cash for
Visual Communications, a stock picture library, on behalf of its Express
Newspapers subsidiary.
Visual Communications sells high-quality photographic images in 30
countries, to various sectors including advertising, marketing, corporate
publishing, books, news-papers and magazines. The company's images are
marketed by agents through a series of catalogues.
Mr Andrew Cameron, managing director of Express Newspapers, said: 'On a
world scale the stock picture market has increased substantially in recent
years. The ability to store and transmit images digitally, the development
of multimedia products and other similar factors will ensure that this
growth continues.
'Express has developed its own digitally-based picture library for
commercial exploitation, and there is considerable potential synergy between
the two businesses.'
Visual Communications doubled turnover between 1991 and 1993. Last year the
company, which will be managed as a separate business unit within United
Newspapers, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.3m on turnover of Pounds
10m. Net assets at the end of December were Pounds 2.1m.
Last summer, United Newspapers raised Pounds 190m through a rights issue and
a further Pounds 73.5m from the sale of Extel Financial, the financial
information group, to Pearson, publishers of the Financial Times.
Since then, the group has made a number of acquisitions, including the
Dollars 100m purchase of Harmon Publishing Company, and the acquisition of
Hong Kong International Trade Fair Group for up to Pounds 29.5m as part of
its strategy of expanding in east Asia.

FT  18 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Britannic Assurance dividend raised 10%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britannic Assurance, the life insurance company, yesterday announced a 10.4
per cent rise in its interim dividend, from 3.85p to 4.25p.
For the six months to June 30 total life premium income fell from Pounds
193.3m to Pounds 186.1m.
However, premium income on the general insurance side held up at Pounds
17.8m (Pounds 17.9m) and an improvement in UK weather helped to turn a
Pounds 1.43m underwriting loss into a profit of Pounds 930,000.
'Bearing in mind the background, we think the progress is good this year,
and we are expecting reasonably healthy profit growth for the year,' said Mr
Brian Shaw, general manager and actuary.
Many large life insurers have already reported sharp falls in new life and
pensions business for the first half of this year, compared with the
equivalent period for new business in 1993.
Britannic, like other life insurance companies, is not required to release
interim profits figures.
Mr Shaw said that a fall in single premium personal pensions sold to people
transferring out of an occupational scheme had contributed to the overall
fall in ordinary branch pensions income from Pounds 68.6m to Pounds 50.4m.
He said that while maturity values for policies of longer than 25 years were
unchanged, maturity values for shorter-term policies would fall by 2 to 3
per cent as a result of reductions to terminal bonus scales for the six
months from end-September this year.
Highlighting the turnround in the performance of the underwriting business
after losses over the last few years, he said that most of it related to
better weather. The company had had to pay out Pounds 1m less in
weather-related claims than in the first half of last year.
Some increases in premiums had also helped towards the costs of meeting
theft claims.

<TEXT>
Managers of Mercury World Mining Trust were unable to keep pace with a
rapidly-advancing mining share market in the period between December 15 and
June 30. Net asset value per share fell by 3.85 per cent, from 97.2p to
93.6p.
However, the investment trust said yesterday it was now fully invested. At
the close on August 15 net asset value had increased to 100.75p.
The trust raised Pounds 425.8m last December - the largest investment trust
launch in the UK.
Mr Peter Wilmot-Sitwell, chairman, said the shares had 'traded at a level
which has compared favourably both with the issue price and with the net
asset value'. The shares, which reached a peak of 125p earlier this year,
were last night unchanged at 107p.
Recently the performance of shares in the natural resources sector had been
restrained by more than Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.2bn) of share offerings by
mining and metals companies taking advantage of improved sentiment.
Net revenue for the period from October 28 to June 30 was Pounds 2.12m on
income of Pounds 6.34m. Earnings per share were 0.5p.

US east coast acquisition

<TEXT>
Bank of Ireland yesterday announced the acquisition of Great Bay Bankshares
of New Hampshire for Dollars 52.6m (Pounds 33.9m), underlining renewed
confidence in the US east coast banking sector.
The purchase price represents 1.3 times GBB's book value.
GBB has five branches offering full banking services in south-eastern New
Hampshire and southern Maine, and will be integrated into the existing
73-branch network of Bank of Ireland's main US subsidiary, First NH bank.
GBB has total assets of Dollars 319m, including a Dollars 180m loan
portfolio consisting mostly of residential mortgages as well as commercial
mortgages and consumer lending.
It reported pre-tax profits of Dollars 2.6m in its last financial year, and
is forecast to produce Dollars 5m this time.
Bank of Ireland said the acquisition had a 'very low level' of
non-performing loans and represented a 'geographic filling-in' of First NH's
coverage of New Hampshire 'in an area where we did not have the market share
we wanted, and an affluent area at that'.
The group's total market share across the state now stands at 20 per cent.
Bank of Ireland First Holdings, the holding company for the group's US
subsidiaries, reported a Dollars 10.3m pre-tax profit for the quarter ending
June 30, compared with a Dollars 2.7m loss.
Bank of Ireland first went into the Hew Hampshire market in 1988 and
suffered heavy losses, but BOIFH produced its first profit last year, with
Dollars 8m pre-tax.

FT  18 AUG 94 / UK Company News: N America helps BICC to Pounds 63m -
Continental Europe cable and UK construction still under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BICC, the cables and construction group, lifted first-half pre-tax profits
by 26 per cent from a restated Pounds 50m to Pounds 63m.
The rise, for the half year to July 2, was in line with City expectations
and came in spite of a slight fall in turnover from Pounds 1.95bn to Pounds
1.93bn.
Earnings per share rose by 10 per cent, from 8.2p to 9p, but the interim
dividend is held at 6p.
Sir Robin Biggam, chairman, said economic recovery was well-established in
North America and was developing satisfactorily in the UK and Australasia.
But continental European cable markets remained difficult in the first half
and margins in the UK construction sector continued to come under severe
pressure, in spite of signs of volume recovery in parts of the market.
In construction, Balfour Beatty's heavy civil and power contracting business
again performed well and the order book for these and other businesses
remained satisfactory.
Sales were lower, however, because of the substantial completion of the
Channel tunnel project and the company's caution in tendering for highly
competitive contracts in the the latter part of 1993.
Sir Robin said the issues relating to the tunnel contract had been
substantially resolved. The company would give more financial details on the
contract 'around the end of the year' when all residual issues should be
settled.
In cables, the UK communications business improved significantly, as did
energy cable exports from the UK, especially high voltage cables to Asia. In
continental Europe overall, market conditions stabilised.
In North America, the combination of an improving market and rationalisation
programmes in the last 12 months had brought a return to profitability. In
Australasia, Metal Manufactures performed well.
BICC said its cash performance had been sound during the recession, but as
it emerged from the downturn 'the inevitable effects of increasing work in
progress, together with copper price rises, are becoming evident'.
Yet, with acquisition spending well down and increased income from
disposals, the net cash outflow at Pounds 94m was reduced by Pounds 24m from
the comparable 1993 figure.

<TEXT>
Waterglade International shareholders will today decide the fate of the
lossmaking property developer at an extraordinary meeting called to oust the
board, writes Simon Davies.
The board claims to be close to achieving a debt restructuring with bankers,
necessary for the company's survival. It had net negative worth of Pounds
10m as at November.
However, rebel holders led by Mr Winston Ng, controlling 11 per cent of the
company, are trying to put together a financing package, involving an
immediate Pounds 6m rights issue.
At the EGM, an attempt will be made to depose the three existing executive
directors, and appoint Mr Ng, Mr Anthony Midgen and Mr Selwyn Midgen.
Waterglade incurred a loss of Pounds 2.37m in the six months to November
1993, and Pounds 11.7m in the 14 months to the previous May.
The management's refinancing plans surfaced last April, when the documents
were inadvertently faxed to marketmakers by the stockbrokers involved in the
deal.

London International Group said yesterday that Genting, the Malaysian casino
and plantations company, had increased its stake in the UK rubber goods
manufacturer to 9.53 per cent.
Genting, Malaysia's fifth largest company with cash assets estimated at
MDollars 1.5bn (Pounds 381m), acquired the shares through Powerstock, its
London-based investment company. Its holding, which stood at 4.4 per cent in

Genting last year spent MDollars 150m on a 6 per cent stake in Lonrho, the
UK conglomerate. It is believed to have sold the majority of that stake.

FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: Tarkett sets its sights on
flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tarkett, Europe's largest manufacturer of hard flooring, yesterday announced
plans for a stock market flotation valuing the German-based company at
between Pounds 400m and Pounds 500m.
The proposals, likely to involve a placing and open offer, follow the
completion earlier this year of a SKr3.46bn (Pounds 286m) buy-out from
Stora, the Scandinavian pulp and paper group.
Mr Lars Wisen, chief executive, said funds from the flotation would be used
to finance acquisitions in western Europe and North America, where the group
already operates 12 manufacturing plants, and to expand its activities in
the emerging markets of eastern Europe and south-east Asia.
He warned, however, that the float was unlikely to take place before next
spring at the earliest.
Announcing increased interim pre-tax profits, he said: 'We are keen to come
to the market. But we will not do so before the conditions are right. We
still have a lot to prove.
'We aim to be the best and only alternative in the flooring world by
focusing on new product areas and strengthening our international presence.'
Mr Wisen led the team which oversaw the buy-out. Stora sold the hardwood and
vinyl flooring business to concentrate on its core forestry operations and
strengthen its balance sheet.
The acquisition was funded mainly by Goldman Sachs and CWB Capital Partners,
the London-based acquisition fund, which together hold more than 87 per cent
of the equity.
Although the two institutions are expected to realise part of their
investment from the flotation, Mr Wisen predicted they would retain a
long-term stake.
Preparations for a listing in both London and Frankfurt include pushing
through a two-year rationalisation programme intended to cut administrative
costs and improve international distribution.
Since 1990, the company has cut its workforce by more than a third to 4,500
and has sold its carpet and ceramic tile businesses.
It has also overhauled its management in Britain, where it plans to
challenge manufacturers such as Marley and James Halstead.
Mr Christer Hiller, chief financial officer, said the rationalisation had
helped lift first-half pre-tax profits by 72 per cent to Pounds 16.7m,
against a pro forma Pounds 9.7m.
Turnover in the six months to June 30 rose from Pounds 263m to Pounds 270.9m
and operating profits increased 36 per cent to Pounds 25.2m.
Mr Hiller attributed improved profit margins of 9.4 per cent (7.1 per cent)
to cost reductions and an increased concentration on higher margin goods.
Most of those products were sold in four main markets: Germany, North
America, central Europe and Scandinavia.
In spite of flat demand in recent months, the group said it had detected
signs of a recovery in continental Europe and was reaping the benefits of
the strengthening US economy.
It was also enjoying buoyant trading in Russia and other former Soviet
republics, where recent demand had outstripped supply.

FT  18 AUG 94 / UK Company News: New chief moves to take Andrews Sykes
private
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Murray, who completed his boardroom takeover at Andrews Sykes by
succeeding Mr David Hubbard as chairman last month, has launched a bid to
take the specialist industrial group private.
European Fire Protection Holding, a private Netherlands-based company owned
by Mr Murray, yesterday lifted its stake from 29.67 per cent to 37.87 per
cent by acquiring a further 1.17m ordinary shares at 50p apiece.
European Fire also acquired 760,000 convertible preference shares,
representing 8.26 per cent of the issued convertible preference share
capital.
The acquisition of the additional ordinary shares triggered the takeover bid
under the City Code.
Under the terms of the bid, disclosed after the market closed, European Fire
is offering 50p a share cash for the outstanding ordinary shares, unchanged
at 47p yesterday, and 12p a share for the preference shares, which also
closed at 47p.
The bid values Andrews Sykes at about Pounds 8.2m. Earlier this year Mr
Murray took Nu-Swift private in a similar buy-out bid.

FT  18 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Aitken Hume Pounds 4.87m in loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aitken Hume International, the former banking group, yesterday announced
pre-tax losses of Pounds 4.87m for the year to March 31, but said it was
still looking at ways for shareholders to realise the value of what is
little more than a Pounds 29m shell company.
During 1994 the company sold Aitken Hume Bank to Secure Trust for up to
Pounds 7.88m, and raised Pounds 3.6m from the sale to Bank Julius Baer of
Aitken Hume Bank (Guernsey).
Last year it sold National Securities Research Corporation, leaving the
finance company, founded 17 years ago by Mr Jonathan Aitken, MP, with no
operating businesses.
Aitken Hume has until October 29 to restructure and develop an operating
finance business or the Stock Exchange will remove its listing. It is
currently reviewing a range of options, the most likely of which is a
reverse takeover or a cash distribution.
As at March 31 the company had net assets of Pounds 29.1m, equivalent to 54p
a share, after deducting the par value of the convertible preference shares.
This compares with the share price of 51p at the time of its suspension in
April.
In addition, the company is owed Dollars 11.8m (Pounds 7.5m) from the sale
of NSR, which is dependent on the resolution of certain tax issues in the
US.
No account of this potential cash has been made on Aitken Hume's balance
sheet, but the company 'has been advised that settlement of these issues is
now likely on terms very favourable to the company'.
There are further potential profits from the proceeds of work-out debt from
Aitken Hume Bank. In the meantime, the company said income from interest and
rent continued to exceed outgoings.
The company is 30 per cent owned by Hong Kong-based Allied Group which is
likely to sell its stake. Said Trust owns another 30 per cent.
Losses per share were 11.03p but a 1p dividend is proposed.

FT  18 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Utd Industries' director resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
United Industries, the precision tools and springs manufacturer, yesterday
said Mr Alan Matthews, its finance director, was resigning as part of a
management overhaul.
His departure follows the retirement of Mr Ernest Hopwell, the group's
longest-serving director, the appointment of Mr Brian Newman to head the
springs division and the decision by Mr Malcolm Pye, company secretary, to
stand down as a director.
Mr Matthews has been replaced by Mr James Coleman, former finance director
at B Elliott, the engineering group where he worked in the past with Mr Tom
Brown, United's chief executive.
Mr Matthews was on a one-year service contract and is expected to receive a
'relatively modest' pay-off.
'We have completed the board reorganisation and now have a strong management
team,' said Mr Brown. 'We've been through a major transformation. Alan
Matthews did a sterling job but I needed to build my own team.'
That transformation was dominated by the Pounds 25m purchase this year of
three engineering businesses from BBA.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Canadian group buys Confed's UK arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sun Life of Canada has bought the UK operation of Confederation Life
Insurance, Canada's fourth largest insurer, in the first disposal of
Confed's businesses since it was seized by financial regulators last week.
Before Confed went into liquidation, analysts had speculated that its UK arm
would fetch about CDollars 400m (Pounds 190m), but the price is thought to
have fallen.
Sun Life, Canada's second-largest insurer, said the Canadian court had ruled
it could not disclose the price at this stage, but it might be able to do so
in one to two months' time once the deal had been concluded.
The Canadian financial regulators have made it clear that they want to move
quickly to sell assets before their value is eroded. Confed's liquidator
said yesterday that a buyer for the collapsed insurer's group health and
life insurance business may be unveiled in a few weeks.
Liquidators took control of Confed last Thursday to prevent a run on
policies and deposits.
Other insurers which have expressed a public interest in acquiring parts of
Confed include Great-West Life Assurance, North American Life Assurance and
Aetna Canada.
The acquisition of Confed's British operation is a significant expansion for
Sun Life of Canada in the UK. It means a 70 per cent increase in its direct
sales force, to 1,700, and the addition of 250,000 policyholders to its
612,000. Confed's UK arm had Pounds 5.8bn assets under management at the
start of the year, while Sun Life in the UK had Pounds 3.9bn.
The purchase will also give it a presence in the pooled pension business,
where Confed is the second largest in the market, and a retail bank.
Sun Life of Canada said it aimed to increase the size and scope of
Confederation Bank, which offers residential mortgages and deposit accounts.
It already has a home loans subsidiary and the two operations are likely to
be integrated.
The company said it had been looking for potential acquisitions in the UK
for some time. It now had the 'critical mass' necessary to do well in the
overcrowded UK life insurance market.
The two organisations will continue to be run separately until regulatory
and other approvals for the deal have been obtained.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Italy simplifies its lines of communication: A look at the
emergence of Telecom Italia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Telephone 'stew' was how the chief executive of Telecom Italia, Italy's
newly formed telecommunications operator, yesterday described the country's
old telecoms sector: a ragout of quoted companies, government departments
and conflicting interests.
Many users - who as recently as 1989 had to wait about three months for the
installation of a new line, and pay more for calls than most of Europe -
have less palatable nicknames for the old system. However, according to Mr
Francesco Chirichigno, Telecom Italia's chief executive, the sector is
entering a new era - simpler, more economical and more competitive -
following the merger of five operating companies to form the new group.
As of today, Italians are the owners of the sixth largest telecoms operator
in the world (behind NTT of Japan, AT&amp;T of the US, and the German, French
and UK national operators), with a combined turnover of some L27,000bn
(Pounds 11bn), a net profit of L1,025bn, 101,000 employees and more than 25m
clients.
Shares that closed in Milan last night as Sip - the old domestic operator -
open this morning as Telecom Italia. Shares in the international operator
Italcable - the only other quoted subsidiary - have been delisted, with
investors compensated in Telecom Italia stock according to a complex
share-swap and capital increase agreed in May.
Telecom Italia is still controlled by Stet, which is also quoted and is in
turn controlled by IRI, Italy's state holding company. All or part of Iri's
65 per cent stake in Stet should be sold off, probably next year. Stet likes
to call itself an industrial holding company, with other interests such as
telecoms software, equipment manufacture and multimedia.
Analysts are generally impressed by the manoeuvre which culminates in
today's stock market launch of Telecom Italia. 'It tidies up what was a very
untidy situation,' says Mr John Clarke, telecoms analyst at Daiwa in London.
'You now have effectively three entities, instead of about six.'
In fact, much work has already been done by Sip to improve its service over
the past five years. The three-month waiting list has been cut to 10 days in
certain cities, for example.
The merger will lead to further cost cuts, although management is are
reluctant to quantify how many of the 100,000 or so jobs might be lost.
Meanwhile, investors and users hope the establishment of an independent
regulator for the Italian telecoms sector will provide clarity and
predictability. Last week, Italy's anti-trust authority warned that without
such a body, and the parallel liberalisation of infrastructure and access to
networks, 'the competitive development of markets could be compromised'.
That said, Italy seems unlikely to open its ordinary domestic network to
full competition until required to do so by EU rules - in 1998 or later.
For investors, the main uncertainty is likely to be the timing of Stet's
privatisation and the promised demerger of Telecom Italia's cellular
telephone business, one of the few areas of business to face domestic
competition.
The recent appointment of Mr Michele Tedeschi, former chief executive of
Stet, as chairman of Iri seemed to raise hopes for an early privatisation of
the telecoms holding company. Last week, however, the Italian industry
minister indicated that Stet was more likely to come to the market in 1995.
Prolonged indecision would be bad for Stet and Telecom Italia, although a
delay as part of a clear timetable for privatisation would not necessarily
displease investors. It would give the companies time to engineer the keenly
awaited spin-off of Telecom Italia's mobile telephone business before the
end of the year, giving Telecom Italia shareholders (including Stet) a stake
in a third quoted Italian telecoms company.
Today's transition is more of a landmark than an earthquake. Analysts
estimate that historic earnings per share of Telecom Italia are 20 per cent
higher than those of Sip alone, but the name-change is unlikely to affect
the share price, which already takes into account the restructuring. And
ordinary users will not experience any sudden improvements in service.
Indeed for customers, the only immediate change is that by substituting
Telecom Italia for the monosyllabic Sip, it takes six times as long to curse
the Italian telephone system.

FT  18 AUG 94 / BICC sets sights on trebling cable sales in Asia: UK group
discusses Chinese venture as profits rise 26% to Pounds 63m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BICC, the UK cables and construction group, is planning to treble its cable
sales in the fast-growing Asia Pacific market to Pounds 500m by the end of
the decade and is discussing a joint venture in China.
The plans were unveiled yesterday as BICC announced a 26 per cent rise in
interim pre-tax profits from a restated Pounds 50m to Pounds 63m. Its shares
rose 4p to 416p.
BICC is the world's second largest cables producer, behind Alcatel of
France, with a strong presence in Europe and North America. Sir Robin
Biggam, chairman, said exploiting the Asia-Pacific infrastructure market was
crucial to the growth of the business, along with added value from product
differentiation and low-cost production.
Group sales in the Asia-Pacific region have risen from about Pounds 120m in
1989 to Pounds 280m last year, of which Pounds 160m came from cables.
Exports from the UK account for Pounds 120m of the Asian cable sales, with
the remaining Pounds 40m coming from 40 per cent-owned Power Cables
Malaysia. Sir Robin said sales of Asian-made cables could rise to Pounds
300m by the end of the decade.
Last month, the group said it was forming BICC Asia-Pacific Cables to handle
business in the region. The UK company will have a 50 per cent stake, with
the remainder held by Metal Manufactures, its 61 per cent-owned Australasian
subsidiary.
Sir Robin said BICC was discussing a venture with Shanghai Cable Works,
China's second biggest producer, and a smaller venture in Vietnam. It was
also pursuing opportunities in Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines.
The importance of the region to BICC was underlined yesterday by the
announcement that Balfour Beatty had received a letter of intent for a
Dollars 158m contract - shared equally with an Indonesian partner - to do
civil works for the 980MW Muara Tawar power station.
Sir Robin said there had been no change in the situation in Malaysia, where
the company has been hit by the ban on government contracts for UK
companies. Private sector activities were continuing.
He expected construction margins to remain under pressure, with any UK
growth dependent on privately financed infrastructure initiatives. BICC also
hopes to raise Pounds 100m over the next 18 months through property sales.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Generators near total sell-off: A look at government plans
to raise Pounds 4bn from its stakes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is planning to take the first public steps next month towards
selling shares in National Power and PowerGen, the privatised generators in
which it still holds 40 per cent stakes, ahead of a disposal in February or
March.
It is preparing to provide details of the process to up to 150 banks,
brokers, building societies and financial advisers.
An announcement on the sale, expected to raise more than Pounds 4bn, is
expected towards the end of September.
The government is planning to sell all its remaining shares. It sold off 60
per cent of each company in their privatisations three years ago.
The government expects to start marketing the sale in mid-January with a
prospectus following about a month to six weeks later. Shares would be
issued either at the end of February or early March.
The sale will be the last of the multi-billion pound disposals of state
holdings. The government's sale of British Coal, British Rail and 51 per
cent of the Post Office would raise considerably less.
At yesterday's closing prices, the government's 40 per cent stakes in
National Power and PowerGen were worth Pounds 4.4bn. That compares with the
government's target of raising Pounds 5.5bn through privatisation this
financial year.
The Treasury has indicated it expects to receive Pounds 3.7bn from other
sources, including the sale of government debt and BT shares, by the end of
October.
This means the government will need less than Pounds 2bn this financial year
from the generator sales. It is likely that payment for the shares in the
two companies will be in instalments, with some proceeds flowing in next
year or later. Ministers have yet to decide whether payments should be made
in two or three instalments.
As in the March 1991 flotation, when 60 per cent of the shares were sold,
buyers will be required to buy shares in both companies.
Existing shareholders are expected to be offered preferential treatment, as
were BT shareholders in the sale of the second and third tranches of its
shares.
For this reason the marketing is expected within the electricity industry to
be aimed at a more sophisticated audience than the original flotation.
'It will be more for the Sidney than the Sid,' said one power company
executive yesterday.
The advertising for the disposal is being handled by WCRS. The government is
being advised by Barclays de Zoete Wedd and Kleinwort Benson on the
financial aspects of the sale, and by Dewe Rogerson, the public relations
and marketing company.
Next month's announcement on timing and details is aimed at giving the
broking and banking 'share shops' maximum opportunity to prepare for the
flotation.
The February/March sale is likely to be followed within a few months by the
flotation of the National Grid, expected to be valued at more than Pounds
4bn. However, this will not necessarily involve its owners, the regional
electricity companies, selling shares and so may not amount to another
cash-call on investors. One option is that shareholders in the regional
companies will be given shares in the Grid.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Swiss bank cushioned by cut in bad loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CS Holding, the international financial services group built around Credit
Suisse, has reported a 19 per cent drop in consolidated net income to
SFr712m (Pounds 350m) for the first half of the year.
The decline is the most modest among the big Swiss financial institutions
that have published interim results in recent days, thanks largely to
sharply reduced bad loan provisions. CS said it had decided to cut these
provisions by 32 per cent to SFr914m, citing 'the economy's recovery'.
Mr Rainer Gut, CS chairman, said the result showed the value of CS's global
spread and broadly diversified activities.
He described the result as satisfactory and said he was confident that the
full-year figures would be good, 'especially as the economic recovery is
gaining in strength and the financial markets appear to be returning to a
more normal state'.
Operating income was down 17 per cent to SFr5.4bn, mainly because of a 43
per cent slide in trading income to SFr1.27bn.
CS said that all its financial subsidiaries suffered declines in securities
trading, but its Credit Suisse Financial Products derivatives subsidiary
maintained its results at the high level of last year.
Net commission income eased 6.5 per cent to SFr2.09bn, as a one-third
decline at investment bank CS First Boston more than offset gains of 6-16
per cent from the group's asset management activities.
Net interest income was off 5 per cent at SFr1.58bn due to a stagnation in
loan volume and squeezed margins. Income from investments in companies
nearly trebled to SFr229m, lifted by the success of Credit Suisse investment
funds.
Operating expenses declined 7 per cent to SFr3.43bn, mainly because
personnel costs at CS First Boston are tied to performance.
Profit before taxes and provisions was down 30 per cent to SFr1.97bn, a
broadly similar result to those at Union Bank of Switzerland and Credit
Suisse.
CS's 32 per cent cut in bad loan provisions is a bigger improvement than the
26 per cent reduction at Union Bank of Switzerland, but well below the 53
per cent decrease at Swiss Bank Corporation.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Blank tape prices may rise if EU supports levy plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Prices of blank video and audio cassettes and of recording equipment may
rise as the result of a European Commission proposal to protect copyright
through a Europe-wide levy.
The draft directive suggests a levy of Ecu0.15 (11p) per hour on audio
tapes, and the equivalent of 19p per hour on video tapes, Pounds 1.57 per
unit of audio equipment and Pounds 7.87 per unit of video equipment.
The UK government, which in 1988 dropped plans to introduce a levy on audio
tapes, will strongly oppose the move.
The Commission wants to harmonise levies currently used in most member
states to reimburse copyright holders, such as production companies and
musicians, who suffer from home copying of their works. Only the UK, Ireland
and Luxembourg have no levy.
The UK says the proposals, which will be discussed by the Commission next
month, will be bureaucratic and penalise disadvantaged people such as the
blind, who rely heavily on taped material. It will also punish ordinary
consumers.
If the Commission proceeds with the idea, it will require the backing of a
qualified majority of EU states for it to be implemented. The UK and other
opposed countries may argue, however, that the levy is a tax, in which case
the decision has to be taken unanimously.
The Commission says it is coming under pressure from copyright holders and
member states to harmonise legislation because the levies vary widely
between countries, causing distortions in the market.
'Everybody says there is a need to act - even the tape producers who do not
like the levy but say that since it exists we should harmonise,' said a
Commission official. 'We will try to do so at a level that is not too
exaggerated.'
The current levies, fixed according to the length of tapes, are highest in
Denmark and France but lowest in Germany.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Takeovers rather than profits lift directors' pay, says
study
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR and WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Top directors do more for their pay by promoting takeovers and increasing
company indebtedness than by concentrating on developing their core
businesses, according to a new report.
The study, which raises questions about the role of executives in takeovers,
says there is only a small connection between the performance of a company's
share price and dividend - the so-called shareholder return - and increases
in top executive pay. There is no relation between directors' pay and
company profit performance.
However the study does suggest company takeovers as one of the main causes
for the 77 per cent real increase in the pay of top executives between 1985
and 1990. The research, published yesterday by the National Institute for
Economic and Social Research and involving around 170 companies, contrasts
that 77 per cent increase with the 17 per cent real average earnings growth
in the same period.
The report says the 'results indicated that lower cash holdings relative to
current liabilities raises pay, as does expansion through takeovers',
through its effect on sales growth. 'Growth by takeover which results in the
firm being cash poor is a strategy for managers which raises pay
considerably.'
Increases in executive pay were 'systematically higher' at companies that
had expanded by takeover rather than through internal or organic growth.
This was 'despite other evidence which suggests that such behaviour does not
enhance firm performance'. The report says the findings raise questions
'about the degree of effective control of top managers' pay and over
decision-making concerning who controls and benefits from takeover
decisions'.
However when takeover activity and other effects were stripped out, annual
pay rises of 13 to 15 per cent a year were still achieved by directors
between 1985 and 1990.
The report says this implies either managerial skills were becoming more
valued by shareholders or that top executives were more able to influence
their own pay levels. Reducing the presence of unions at a company also
'results in higher pay'.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Clinton loses a second top aide to Whitewater: Altman
resigns as deputy US treasury secretary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Roger Altman, the deputy US treasury secretary, resigned yesterday,
making him the second prominent Clinton administration casualty of the
Whitewater affair.
In a letter to President Bill Clinton, he regretted 'any mistakes or errors
of judgment I may have made'. He hoped his departure would 'help diminish
the controversy'.
Mr Clinton, a friend of many years standing, replied: 'I believe you have
taken the right step under the circumstances.' Ms Jean Hanson, the
treasury's legal counsel, is also expected to leave shortly. Like Mr Altman,
her testimony to Congress on Whitewater was questioned.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, treasury secretary, had recommended undersecretary Mr
Frank Newman as Mr Altman's replacement, a department spokesman said.
The fate of Mr Altman, a leading architect of administration economic
policies for the past 18 months, was in effect sealed last week. It was then
that the two senior Democratic senators on the finance committee - Mr Don
Riegle, the committee chairman, and Mr Paul Sarbanes - privately told Mr
Bentsen and Mr Lloyd Cutler, the White House legal counsel, that Mr Altman
had lost the confidence of Congress and should therefore resign.
Since then, White House officials have repeatedly qualified earlier
statements of confidence in Mr Altman and said the final decision had to be
his. A similar experience had befallen Mr Bernard Nussbaum, the White House
legal counsel, who resigned four months ago.
Mr Altman had endured nine hours of grilling by the committee on August 2 on
the question of his knowledge of briefings given by the treasury to the
White House on the status of investigations into Madison Guaranty. This is
the bankrupt Arkansas savings bank previously owned by the Clintons' partner
in the Whitewater land development. At the time of the briefings, Mr Altman
was acting head of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency responsible
for cleaning up the savings and loan debacle of the 1980s.
He repeatedly denied any interference with the investigatory processes and
said he had been cleared of any ethical or criminal wrongdoing by Mr Robert
Fiske, the former Whitewater special counsel, and by the non-partisan
government ethics office.
But additional controversy centred on his delay in 'recusing'
(disqualifying) himself from the Madison case because of his longstanding
friendship with the Clintons.
Mr Altman, a former Wall Street investment banker, had appeared to be one of
the rising stars in the administration and was widely seen as a successor to
Mr Bentsen.

FT  18 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Tax rate swaps
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wouldn't it be nice if companies could protect their earnings from sharp
increases in corporation taxes? That is the promise held out by Morgan
Grenfell, which has taken the first tentative step to creating a tax rate
swap market in the UK. It believes that, given the prospect that Labour
could win the next election, many companies will want to guard against the
danger of higher taxes. Its tax swap product - modelled on interest rate
swaps - could allow companies to fix their tax rates.
For the whole concept to work, of course, it is necessary to find
counterparties willing to bear the risk of tax rates rising. Morgan Grenfell
has managed to unearth one such counterparty - an international bank which
actually suffers when corporation tax is cut because of the nature of
various equipment leases it holds. But the size of the deal is only Pounds
15m and the number of parties in such a peculiar tax position is likely to
be limited.
If tax rate swaps are to be anything more than a niche product, the market
will have to embrace a wider range of counterparties. One idea is that the
scheme might appeal to companies with heavy investment programmes. Though
they too would suffer from higher tax rates, the blow could be softened if
Labour were simultaneously to improve capital allowances. Given a sufficient
inducement, they might be prepared to cushion other companies' tax risks.

FT  18 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: BICC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BICC produced just enough in yesterday's interim figures to sustain the
stock market's considerable faith in its recovery potential. The swing back
into profits in the US after three years in the red was the biggest factor
behind a 26 per cent rise in pre-tax profits. With a fair wind in the second
half, the group may be able to cover its dividend this year for the first
time since 1990.
The nagging worry is that much of the improvement reflects cost-cutting and
rationalisation rather than improved market conditions. Despite the pace of
US recovery and more stable markets in Europe, cables prices are no higher
than this time last year. In addition to general deflationary pressures,
overcapacity remains a problem at the low-technology end of the business.
Privatised telecommunications and power utilities may also prove to be more
demanding customers than they were in the public sector. Against that
background, restoring operating margins in cable back to the levels of the
late 1980s will be a long - if not impossible - task.
With Balfour Beatty experiencing margin pressure as well, BICC looks on
track for a steady rather than spectacular earnings recovery. While a safe
yield of 5.7 per cent limits the downside for the shares, a multiple of over
20 times this year's forecast earnings demands something more. For all
BICC's good work positioning the business through recession, the suspicion
remains that cables markets are exceptionally difficult. That may explain
why the group has underperformed the stock market over five, 10 and 20
years.

FT  18 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: ABB
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The doubling of the Asea and Brown Boveri share prices over the past 18
months has been driven partly by ABB's growth prospects in East Asia. So its
comments yesterday about mounting competition and falling prices,
particularly in China, were unsettling. While too much should not be read
into one half's figures, it was perhaps significant that margins in power
generation, which is heavily biased towards East Asia, slipped back in the
first six months although the group figure rose from 7.2 per cent to 8.5 per
cent.
This improvement is the reward for years of painful cost cutting which has
seen production shifted to low cost centres in eastern Europe and Asia. The
process continued in the first half, with the group wage bill down 3 per
cent compared with a year before. The group's margin target of 10 per cent
looks within reach over the next couple of years and the combination of
recovery in Europe, continued growth in East Asia and a falling tax charge
could lead to a near doubling of earnings by 1996. That would put the shares
of Brown Boveri, the Swiss parent company, on a multiple of around 12.
Shares in Sweden's Asea, which owns the other half of ABB, have proved less
popular with international investors recently and their multiple of 1996
earnings is down to little more than 10.
The ratings are in line with other European capital goods companies with
arguably poorer growth prospects. The worry is that the pressure on prices
in East Asia will absorb all ABB's efforts on cost. If so, its fatter rivals
are in for a very painful ride.

FT  18 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: The price is right
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The combination of excellent news on UK retail price inflation and Tuesday's
increase in US interest rates was just what the UK stock market wanted to
hear. An early rise in British interest rates is now both unlikely and
unnecessary. Meanwhile the Federal Reserve's crackdown on US inflationary
pressures should cap bond yields on both sides of the Atlantic. Though gilts
closed off their highs last night as European markets wobbled ahead of
today's Bundesbank meeting, equities remained strong.
Mr Eddie George, the Bank of England governor, may still be itching to raise
base rates. He is rightly concerned to maintain his anti-inflationary
credibility with the markets. But the battle against inflation must not
eclipse all other economic goals. The objective at this stage of the cycle
should be to prolong the upturn for as long as possible. Confidence that
inflation will remain subdued is, of course, necessary to persuade industry
to invest in new capacity. Yet a premature tightening of monetary policy
could also deter industry from expanding its capacity, particularly since
another twist of the fiscal screw is due next April. Given the dearth of
inflationary signs, a rise in base rates would now be premature. Not only is
the underlying retail price inflation rate of 2.2 per cent at its lowest
level since the series began in 1975, but wage inflation remains under
control while both the housing and car markets are sluggish. At some stage,
UK interest rates will have to follow their US counterparts higher. But that
time has not yet arrived.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Breaking the chains of freedom: Racial reconciliation is the
most important legacy of Nelson Mandela's first 100 days in power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a rare honeymoon that lasts 100 days, in politics or in life. The new
South Africa has had its period of wonder and bliss; now South Africans are
getting down to the really rather difficult business of life after
apartheid.
Later today, President Nelson Mandela will mark his 100th day in office with
a speech to parliament outlining the achievements of his new government, and
charting a path to future prosperity.
The review of past achievements will, inevitably, be short; for the past 100
days have been far more notable for disasters averted, than for positive
change. Scarcely three months after all-race elections hailed as a miracle
worldwide, the euphoria which followed the poll has faded; but the new-found
spirit of national unity, fostered almost single-handedly by President
Mandela, remains strong.
It is almost impossible to find anyone, white or black, with a bad word to
say about Nelson Mandela. Rightwing leaders - even the hard-line
Conservative party leader Ferdi Hartzenberg, whose party boycotted the poll
 -vie to have their photos taken shaking the hand of the new president.
Inkatha Freedom party head Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi is fulsome in his
praise. And in spite of rumblings from a disaffected back-bench, South
Africa's former rulers, the National party, remain eager junior members of
the Mandela government.
None of this seemed inevitable, or even likely, before the poll; and even
the most conservative commentator has been quick to give credit to Mandela
himself. Racial reconciliation is the most important legacy of his first 100
days; without it, there could be no progress in the hundreds more yet to
come.
But the first 100 days have also demonstrated that political stability is
not enough. Democracy must also be made to pay: to provide housing,
education, healthcare and jobs for the poor; foster the advancement of
blacks in business as managers and as owners, and in the civil service;
remove apartheid inequalities.
Informal opinion polls - in the townships, on television and radio, and in
offices of leading cities - show that most blacks believe their material lot
has not improved since the elections. They also show that few blacks are
surprised by this - and that most are willing to give Mandela time to
deliver. Ordinary people are eager to excuse his lack of action: many
explain, with pride, that their president is busy sorting out the problems
of Rwanda; that he is shouldering the burden of the whole of Africa; that
they trust him to deliver in the end.
But political activists are not so patient, and will find it easier and
easier to exploit township impatience. Simon Zondi, an African National
Congress activist in KwaZulu Natal, says: 'People expected that as soon as
the ANC takes over, they will see a change. But up to now that's not what's
happened. To people's minds, the old (FW) de Klerk government is still in
power.'
Township activists such as Zondi, experienced at mobilising resistance
around popular concerns such as lack of housing, are likely to give
President Mandela a rough ride in the months and years to come.
They will not act alone: Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary general, has made
clear that he sees himself as the conscience of the ANC. His future
political career depends on mobilising disaffected ANC members behind him in
his role as unofficial government watchdog; he has already launched his
campaign with an attack on high parliamentary and government salaries.
Mandela will have to deliver significant advancements in socio-economic
development - and market them well - if he is to withstand this grassroots
challenge.
So far, change has been slow. In his state of the nation address soon after
becoming president in May, Mandela promised that his first 100 days would
bring free healthcare to every pregnant woman and child under six, and
supplementary feeding schemes at every primary school. The launch of the
latter has been delayed until September 1, and the former, though
implemented, has caused considerable chaos in hospitals. And what is worse,
it is understood that even these limited programmes are over budget, and
that the president's office has been seeking donor funding to ensure they
are maintained.
This is an ominous sign for the future of the Reconstruction and Development
Programme, the ambitious development plan which President Mandela is
expected to detail in his speech to parliament today. For the president
spent much of his first 100 days trying to persuade overseas and local
investors that the RDP's goals could be achieved without increasing overall
government spending; some R2.5bn is to be spent on the RDP in the current
financial year, but all of it is to come from savings in other government
departments.
Unfortunately for Mandela, the markets showed little sign of believing his
assurances on the subject of fiscal discipline (the news that Derek Keys,
finance minister, is to resign from October, though for personal reasons,
did not help). If there are now signs that RDP expenditure is straining the
budget - coupled with fears of a revenue shortfall provoked by recently
released gross domestic product growth figures showing that the 3 per cent
economic expansion projected for this year may be difficult to achieve -
then the new government's fiscal credibility could suffer further.
But for the moment, President Mandela appears to feel he has spent enough
time defending his credibility with potential investors, local businessmen,
and whites in general. His speech is expected to reach out to his mass black
constituency, to reassure them that the anti-apartheid struggle is about to
begin paying off.
But he will have to do more than simply announce a string of development
targets, however laudable. He must take steps to overcome signs of paralysis
in government: for the ongoing tussle between central government and
provinces over the devolution of constitutional powers is severely hampering
delivery under the RDP; a damaging row between national housing minister Joe
Slovo and Tokyo Sexwale, provincial premier of the
Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging metropolis, over housing construction has
not helped the government's public image; and the relative powerlessness of
provincial government is also impeding progress towards the racial
integration of local government, which will also bring many development
benefits.
Even more importantly, Mandela must demonstrate that he is ready to do more
than simply exhort the economy to grow (as he did last week when he insisted
he was not happy with a projected 2.5 per cent growth rate and preferred 5
per cent).
He must reduce the cost of government itself, which as Mr Keys pointed out
in a recent speech, consumes 21 per cent of national income, far above the 9
per cent spent on government in Japan and 10 per cent in South Korea. Yet
all the pressures point towards increasingly costly government: under the
constitution, Mandela cannot sack white civil servants, but he must promote
blacks - leading to an inevitable expansion. And the new provincial
governments will also increase the civil service burden.
Mandela must also use his influence to foster an increase in labour
productivity. According to figures compiled by Pretoria's National
Productivity Institute, a quasi-government body, hourly manufacturing wages
in South Africa, at Dollars 4.78 in 1993 dollars, rank just below wage rates
in Singapore and South Korea, where productivity is far higher, and well
above countries such as Malaysia (Dollars 1.80).
So in the hundreds of days to come, Mandela must show that his government is
capable of delivering an economic miracle to match the feats of political
magic which stunned the world. For as ANC leaders constantly stress, the
political kingdom is worthless without the economic development to make it
habitable. The anti-apartheid struggle is finally over; but the economic
battle has just begun.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Top pay going overboard
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The public reaction to this week's Pounds 2.02m pay-off for Reed Elsevier's
former co-chairman is symptomatic of a growing disquiet at the way UK
executives are paid. Cautious efforts to reform the system have thus far
focused on avoiding its most obvious excesses. But shareholders and
executives should realise that there is more at stake. The steady pace of
the current recovery owes much to the restrained growth in average wages.
Bucking that trend in the boardroom may threaten that achievement.
The three-year rolling contracts offered to Reed Elsevier's directors have
been the subject of a welcome campaign by PosTel Investment Management, one
of the UK's largest pension funds. So far, as Wednesday's FT survey on the
subject showed, the fund's efforts are having limited success. PosTel itself
has only tried to outlaw rolling contracts of longer than two years, though
it is difficult to find a justification for ones lasting longer than a year.
Even these would merely lower the cost of rewarding failure, not eliminate
the practice altogether.
Building a system of executive compensation that better matches risk with
reward means analysing the way incumbent executives are paid, not merely
those who depart with 'golden parachutes'. Headline-grabbing pay rises for
top executives continue to incite public mistrust of that process, much of
it deserved.
Focusing on million-pound packages may give a distorted picture of the
'going rate' for upper and middle management, but overall behaviour is not
much more restrained. Sedgwick Noble Lowndes, the pay and benefits
consultants, last month reported that executive pay was rising 50 per cent
faster than the 3.75 per cent growth in average earnings announced yesterday
for the year to June.
Sound judgment
It is up to shareholders, and executives themselves, to decide whether their
salaries are excessive, not the government. But UK shareholders are
currently ill-equipped to make a sound judgment, while executives appear to
see few advantages in restraint. One approach to making their interests more
compatible, performance-related pay, is increasingly popular: 44 per cent of
top executives are now covered by such a scheme. But experience of these
schemes in the UK and the US has been mixed. Understanding the terms of such
schemes is often as tricky as judging their effectiveness.
Indeed, research by Mr Martin Conyon and Mr Paul Gregg, published yesterday
in the Economic Review of the National Institute of Economic and Social
Research, indicates that even where the concerns of shareholders have an
effect, it is not always a desirable one. They find that, in the latter half
of the 1980s, many top UK executives were able to win themselves higher
salaries by engaging in takeover and other sales-boosting strategies, even
though this did not add to shareholder returns, and often made the company
particularly vulnerable in the subsequent recession.
Greater disclosure
There is no single route to improving this process, but any attempt will
rely on greater disclosure of its inner workings. The 1993 Cadbury report on
corporate governance should have gone further in its recommendations on
disclosure, but that should not stop shareholders themselves from demanding
greater transparency. In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission has
forced companies to reveal much more than is now required in the UK.
It is a human trait to believe that one is paid at least as much as one
deserves, but this must be balanced against the broader consequences.
Executives need to remember that a competitive market system depends, for
its legitimacy, on the visible reward only of visible success. The current
system ensures neither.
The challenge is not principally to the executives, but to the shareholders
who own these companies. Unfortunately, greater transparency is likely to
have only a limited effect on their ability to control executive pay. Even
if shareholders are given information, the fragmented structure of share
ownership means that few have a significant stake in acting on it
aggressively. It is up to those big institutions that own large shares in
individual companies to give a far stronger lead.

So what can you deduce about a politician from the clothes he wears? Too
much, one of the opposition socialists standing in Germany's October general
election has obviously decided. Accordingly, the bearded and
well-upholstered Thomas Kruger has decorated most of Berlin with his own
life-size image, unmodified by a stitch of clothing. Behind the bulging
flesh is 'an honest politician with nothing to hide'.
Funny, looks to the untrained eye more like another politico with an
over-developed ego . . .

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Washington rumour mills have been working overtime discussing which
members of the US Treasury team would be thrown to the wolves as a result of
the Whitewater affair. However, one official who should still be standing
when the dust settles is Frank Newman, 52, BankAmerica's former chief
financial officer.
Newman, the softly spoken undersecretary for domestic finance, is tipped to
take over from Roger Altman as number two to Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury
secretary. The other undersecretary, Larry Summers, has shown little
interest in the banking and regulatory issues that tend to take up much of
the deputy's time, and is expected to stay on the international affairs
beat.
There has been gossip that one of the White House's top economics officials,
such as Bo Cutter, who spearheads the foreign trade team, might be moved
across the road to Treasury. But Bentsen may well feel that another channel
of communication to the White House is the last thing he needs at the
moment. Newman earned his spurs helping nurse BankAmerica back to health in
the 1980s. Restoring faith in the US Treasury may test his skills to their
limit.

If you pay peanuts, you get monkeys. This old adage comes to mind after the
latest howler in the Wall Street Journal Europe's investment dartboard
contest. It involved a bunch of investment professionals pitting their
stock-picking skills against a group of monkeys (said to be reporters in
real life) who choose their stocks by throwing darts at the newspaper's
stock market pages.
On Tuesday, the WSJ ran a big story about how its dart-tossing monkey had
beaten the investment pros yet again.
Perhaps the WSJ should go easy on the peanuts. Yesterday it had to admit
that the shares picked by the investment pros had in fact risen by 8.7 per
cent and not fallen by 7 per cent, which looks pretty impressive compared
with the 5.5 per cent decline in the monkey's portfolio. Apparently, someone
had forgotten to take account of a share split.
The motto of this unhappy tale is that, while the monkeys should not be
stopped from throwing darts, perhaps the investment pros should do the
adding up.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Timothy Clifford, director of the National Galleries of Scotland, was
back-pedalling hard yesterday, following a gaffe that may nullify his
efforts to stop Canova's statue, the Three Graces, going to the Getty
Museum.
He publicly apologised for saying that John Paul Getty II's crucial promise
of Pounds 1m for the appeal was motivated by the fact that father and son
had never got on.
'Clifford looks as though he's snatched the cup from his own lips,' said a
sympathetic but appalled figure in the art world yesterday. Others may be
less forgiving.
Clifford, 48, who can be rather pompous, is boundlessly energetic. In his 10
years at Edinburgh he's shaken up the National Gallery - redecorating it in
ruby, gilt and damask - and put its attendants into a tartan of his own
design.
And the row over the choice of Glasgow for a gallery of Scottish art was
partly the fault of the gallery's trustees, chaired by merchant banker Angus
Grossart.
But at the height of that controversy Clifford did not help matters. He
disparagingly described Scottish art thus: 'At times it's very good, at
times it's bloody awful.'
That went down poorly with the stalwarts of the Scottish art world, who
dislike Clifford's grand manner, English blood and upper-class accent.
Clifford probably doesn't have much time for them, either.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It's the silly season for news - maybe sillier than usual. The Irish Times
last week ran a story - since repeated elsewhere - which reported that
Ballymena undertaker Conrad O'Lone was commissioned by an unnamed Nigerian
oil baron to conduct the funeral of his 114-year-old grandmother, buried in
a 500lb gold-plated casket costing Pounds 1m.
She died in December but was embalmed and finally buried in February this
year, when a purported 200,000 people attended a four-day funeral service.
Total cost? A reported Pounds 4m.
Hmmm. Why should O'Lone choose to publicise his story now, some six months
after the event? Yesterday O'Lone was not at his Ballymena number. Nor was
he available at The Limelight, a Dublin bar where, Observer was advised by
O'Lone's Ballymena company, Graveside Services, he could be contacted.
Nigeria's High Commission in London said yesterday: 'We were ourselves
wondering if it were true. It's too outlandish, though the village of Issele
Uku (where the funeral is said to have occurred) does exist. There could
have been a flamboyant burial, perhaps - but on such a scale?'
Information officer Charles Chikese adds that, surprisingly, he saw no
report of the funeral in The Guardian or The Daily Times, Nigeria's two
biggest newspapers.
Curiouser and curiouser. Maybe the Nigerian hacks misheard the name as Con
Alone.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Controlling population
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two stories are told in the annual report from the United Nations population
fund, published yesterday. The first is one of success: in the past 40 years
the rate of growth of the world's population has slowed sharply. The second
 -about prospects for the future - is less cheerful. Nevertheless, the
evidence shows neither that population growth is the overwhelming problem it
is so often alleged to be, nor that policy is helpless to lower it, even in
poor countries. What is required is no more - but also no less - than to
help people, particularly women, achieve the families they themselves
desire.
The most encouraging feature of past experience is that, contrary to the
once cherished theories of demographers, declines in the rate of population
growth have occurred even in countries that have seen little economic
growth. Education of women has helped. But much of the fall can be
attributed to better distribution of contraception, argues the UN. One of
the clearest messages of the report is that people will willingly use
contraception, if it is made available.
The UN's story about the prospects for coming decades is somewhat more
disturbing. The number of people on the planet is likely almost to double,
from the present 5.7bn to some 10bn, by the middle of next century. This
assumes that birth rates continue to fall; other assumptions suggest figures
between 8bn and 12.5bn.
Food supplies
Yet such increases need be no disaster. The UN report rightly rebuts fears
of a global food shortage, of the kind voiced by the Club of Rome two
decades ago. But uneven distribution of the world's food supplies leaves
people in many regions facing starvation. More even than food, water may
become a cause of conflict. It also warns that pressure on other natural
resources - forests, seas and the atmosphere - will increase.
Yet it is important to recognise that population growth is not the sole
cause of pressure on resources. Nor would even a stable global population
halt it. Economic growth is still more important. That is why the 15 per
cent of the world's population in rich countries consumes so
disproportionate a share of global resources. It is also why calls from this
minority for limits on the numbers of the poor majority look morally
disreputable.
Neither prophecies of doom nor hypocritical bombast are justified. What is
needed, instead, is for developing countries themselves to recognise that
unchecked population growth imposes, at best, a heavy burden of additional
investment upon them. At worst, it threatens their social stability, as
people flood from the countryside to the cities, in search of jobs.
Family planning
These pressing social and economic issues underline the importance of next
month's conference in Cairo, the first UN meeting on population for a
decade. The UN's draft agenda calls for co-ordination of measures to
stabilise the world's population, including a trebling of spending on family
planning programmes, and better education for women.
This is the right policy agenda, because it emphasises helping people help
themselves. This is not just the most ethical, but also the most practical
way to address the issue, since what people want for themselves is also what
their societies need.
Despite the convergence of support for such measures among governments, the
agenda faces opposition. This month the Vatican, which has called on
governments to boycott the conference, accused the UN of promoting abortion.
That charge is ill-founded, given that the United Nations Population Fund
(UNFPA) is barred from portraying abortion as a way to control family size.
It would be both inhumane and imprudent for governments to reject the UN's
draft agenda. That is not to make light of the social and cultural
implications of the policies recommended by the UNFPA. But it is surely
right for women to be given control over the number of children they bear.
Western countries should assist countries that wish to make contraception
available, though not those that resort to coercion. They should also remind
recalcitrant governments that the alternative to contraception is both lower
growth in incomes per head and serious social disruption.

FT  18 AUG 94 / A town like Kokstad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nelson Mandela made racial reconciliation the top priority of his first 100
days in office. And in the streets of the Natal town of Kokstad -
preposterously wide and scrupulously clean, like the streets of almost every
other white dorp (town) in South Africa - his crusade has made its mark.
In the hospital and the library, the hotels and the shops, change is subtly
apparent. Eager or suspicious, reluctant or resigned, the people of Kokstad
are struggling to assume the new identity thrust on them by the
constitution: as equal citizens of one non-racial nation.
In the elegant Cape Dutch town hall building which serves as library,
librarian Heather Blackway can no longer pretend to herself - as so many
whites have done for so many decades - that she does not live in Africa.
White hegemony established Kokstad (which, ironically, was founded by native
Griqua tribesmen in the late 19th century) as a small corner of Europe in
Africa. 'Now we are an African dorp, no doubt about it,' Mrs Blackway
comments wistfully, noting that she can never be sure of finding garlic in
the local greengrocer's - because, she says, blacks eat cabbage and most
consumers are now black - and lamenting the fact that 'African time is part
of our everyday existence now'.
The library has been transformed: April's elections triggered a flood of new
black members, who now outnumber the whites. For though the library has been
open to all races for some time, Africans were reluctant to demand their
municipal rights until a black government was in place. Mrs Blackway
welcomes this, but cannot help complaining of the cultural changes it has
wrought. 'They all talk so loud,' she says, while another librarian comments
that whites no longer linger for a (quiet) chat at the check-out desk, as in
the old South Africa.
Mrs Blackway is clearly suffering a crisis of identity in her native land.
Like most white Kokstad residents, she finds it hard to relate to its new
symbols: the multicoloured flag, which one white town councillor dismisses
as 'a jockstrap up a flagpole'; the new national anthem, Nkosi sikele
i'Africa (God Bless Africa), which has joined the Afrikaans anthem Die Stem;
even the new president. For while Mr Mandela is universally popular among
both blacks and whites, Mrs Blackway and most others say he is not 'our
president' - he is president of one section of a still-divided nation, not
yet the national leader.
But if some of Kokstad's whites are none too keen on the new South Africa -
local blacks say they are regularly confronted by the taunt 'Go and ask
Mandela' when looking for a job - others focus on the fact that, whatever
the current uncertainties, things could have been so much worse.
Athena Fawcett and her husband Paul farm dairy and beef cattle near the
border with the former black homeland of Transkei, where several white
motorists and farmers were murdered before the elections. Athena points to
the spot just outside her home where an armoured car used to mount a daily
roadblock; now life is peaceful again, neighbours travel to Transkei resorts
for holidays, and Athena says she is 'totally relaxed'. She thinks President
Mandela is a 'saint on earth', and her husband concurs.
Mayor Bevan Gattrell also agrees. 'The election came and within days you
would have sworn you were in a different country. All of a sudden we were
all part of the same country.' The poll lifted a weight from his shoulders.
'Now we can also say: this bloody government,' says Mr Gattrell, noting that
the town was one of the first to set up an ad hoc multiracial local council
to run Kokstad (population 5,000 whites and 5,000 coloureds) and the black
township of Bhongweni (population 18,000 blacks) until local elections next
year.
Residents of Bhongweni, like their white counterparts, reflect a variety of
views. Elderly nurse Elsina Masizana says race relations were transformed by
the election. 'Whites used to nurse the whites and blacks used to nurse the
blacks. Now we are working hand in hand together.' Fellow nurse Rosemary
Mapekula is less sanguine. 'Sometimes I come across whites and they are
nice. Other times I think these people are not yet in the mood,' she says.
Young Simon Zondi, local political activist and chairman of the Bhongweni
Civic Association, is more forthright. 'Whites are saying that (blacks can
take over) at national level 'but not in my house, not where I work, I am
still a white man and he is a black man'.' But even Mr Zondi, who is
impatient for change not just in race relations but in economic development,
acknowledges 'it's not an easy thing. You don't just wake up and things have
changed.
'If it happens in three months, it won't be real,' he concludes. The
honeymoon is over; now the real work of nation-building can begin.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Why an A-level is not the B-all: Why UK employers will not
cheer today's exam results as much as the students
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eighteen-year-old school-leavers in England and Wales, who receive their
A-level results this morning, will be able to congratulate themselves on
achieving better grades than any previous year.
By contrast, many employers now regard England's uniquely specialised
A-level system, and post-16 schooling in general, as having failed.
A broad coalition now favours radical reform of A-levels. It includes not
only employers' organisations such as the Confederation of British Industry,
but also teachers' professional organisations, leading independent schools,
scientific bodies such as the Royal Society, and universities.
The Labour party is also campaigning for reform, calling last month for the
abolition of A-levels. The opposition party, it seems, is now more in tune
with some of the government's most natural supporters, increasing the
pressure on new education secretary Mrs Gillian Shephard to deliver at least
some reforms.
Mr John Patten, sacked as education secretary last month, was a fierce
opponent of A-level reform, saying it would involve abandoning a
well-established and respected educational 'gold standard'. As yet, there is
no sign that the official line has changed: Mr Eric Forth, the new schools
minister, has echoed Mr Patten's sentiments, describing A-levels as 'a
world-renowned trademark of Britain's educational excellence'.
In international terms, however, the A-level system, where students normally
sit exams in just three subjects, is an oddity. Candidates for the French
baccalaureat typically take seven subjects. Similarly, the US high-school
diploma requires students to study English, mathematics, a science and a
foreign language - usually as part of a seven-subject curriculum.
UK employers are increasingly worried that the early specialisation required
for A-levels - and their emphasis on academic, not vocational, ability -
harms the country's competitiveness in two ways.
First, employers argue that A-levels deter sixth-formers from going on to
study science or engineering at degree level. Such degrees require an
understanding, to A-level standard, of the main principles of mathematics
and usually at least two science subjects. Candidates who 'mix' science
A-levels with arts subjects may show intellectual breadth, but they do not
have enough grounding in pure sciences to embark on a science degree.
Research by Professor Alan Smithers of Manchester University's school of
education shows that the proportion of A-level candidates mixing arts and
sciences is growing, suggesting pent-up demand for a broader sixth-form
curriculum.
Prof Smithers's figures show 40 per cent fewer candidates taking maths and
science subjects last year than there were in 1983. The Joint Mathematical
Council, which represents academics and promotes maths as a subject, says
this means a 40 per cent drop in the numbers qualified to study science or
engineering at university.
Employers' second reason for disliking A-levels is that they believe the
exams have inhibited the growth of vocational qualifications. Over the past
two years, the government has sought to encourage 16-18-year-olds to take
the new general national vocational qualification (GNVQ).
But Mr Roger Opie, education officer of the Industrial Society, an employers
association which promotes good employment practice, says the A-level 'gold
standard' deters students and employers from taking the new qualification
seriously. 'Despite GNVQs, there are still schools persuading people to do
A-levels who should not be doing them, and there's still a lot of parental
pressure to do A-levels.'
He points out that, even this year, almost 20 per cent of A-level students
will fail. Students who fail to get the grades required by universities will
have wasted two years. Their time, as far as employers are concerned, would
have been far better spent in vocational education, Mr Opie says.
While it is easy to find fault with the current system, it is harder to find
agreement on how to replace it. Proponents of reform fall into two broad
camps.
The more radical proposes scrapping A-levels and replacing them with a
system similar to a continental baccalaureat.
Mrs Ann Taylor, Labour's education spokesman, wants to create a new General
Certificate of Further Education (GCFE), which would remove the current
division between academic and vocational qualifications by incorporating
them within one framework.
Students would work towards their GCFE by accumulating academic or
vocational 'modules'. Both would be treated equally when modules were
graded. Some subjects - almost certainly English and mathematics - could be
compulsory.
Similar proposals have been backed by academic science groups. Even some
employers organisations have welcomed Labour's contribution to the debate.
Mr Opie, of the Industrial Society, says: 'There's a lot in the Labour party
document which pleases us. While there are separate structures for academic
and vocational courses, there's always going to be this feeling that
students should do A-levels at all costs.'
The second camp of reformers is more gradualist. It proposes keeping the
main features of A-levels - their academic content and emphasis on exams -
but reforming their content, so that it would be feasible for pupils to take
five subjects as the norm. This was the main recommendation of the Higginson
committee, set up to examine reform of sixth-form education by the then
education secretary, Mr Kenneth Baker, in 1987.
Mr Baker rejected the report when it was published a year later, but the
Higginson proposals are still the favourite option of the committee of
vice-chancellors and principals, which represents UK universities, and by
the main head teachers' organisations. Prof Smithers says A-levels could be
made 'leaner and fitter', without lowering their standards, by trimming
about 20 per cent from syllabuses - for example, cutting the number of books
required for English literature A-level.
He also believes that students could take more subjects if they spent more
of their time at school in lessons, rather than in private study - at
present most sixth-formers are unsupervised for roughly a third of each
school week.
Prof Smithers suggests such reforms would preserve the best features of
A-levels: 'What makes them the gold standard is the examining process. They
would still have questions set by teachers, reflecting what they think
people need to know, and then be conducted by an independent examining
board.'
A slimmed-down A-level system would also allow students to mix academic and
vocational qualifications. For example, students could take A-levels in
maths and physics, plus English to ensure adequate communication skills, and
also a GNVQ. Crucially, students could take a mixed curriculum while
studying all the basic science needed to keep a science degree as an option.
Mrs Shephard has yet to indicate whether she might be prepared to
contemplate streamlining A-levels in this way. On a party political level,
such a move would help counter the progress Labour has made in winning the
support of employers for its education policy.
At the same time, going down this route would be less risky than introducing
a new French-style baccalaureat. Mrs Shephard already faces a considerable
task in restoring morale in a teaching profession embittered by years of
argument over the introduction of a national curriculum and testing for
under 16s.
The snag for the government is that it would have to reverse its past
opposition to the Higginson report. But by reforming the A-level system,
rather than overseeing its abolition, ministers would be able to go some way
towards addressing the concerns of employers - and argue that England and
Wales had not left the education gold standard.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Gas spot market to meet operational
needs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr COLIN BRYCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, With reference to your articles regarding the spot gas market ('Spot
lights way to futures' and 'Proposals drawn up for 'spot' market on gas
prices', August 15), we would like to make a few points which we hope will
help you fully understand our proposal.
The proposed market is an operational market, first and foremost. The need
for the market arises from the requirement to create an on-the-day system
balancing structure to ensure that British Gas's National Transmission
System is operationally secure.
The EMMS proposed market or a similar one is necessary even if no short-term
commercial transactions occur. The EMMS market bears little similarity to
either the US spot market or the UK Electricity Pool, because the market's
primary purpose is operationally to balance the system, not conduct
commercial trans-actions, although we recognise that such transactions may
occur.
Regardless of the type of market used to balance the system on the day,
British Gas will undoubtedly ensure that safety standards remain at their
current high level. The probability of customers being cut off or explosions
occurring is no greater than at present, and their safety will not be
compromised. British Gas has done an exceptional job to ensure customer
safety and security and will, we presume, continue to do so, regardless of
how the gas industry evolves.
The proposal attributed to Morgan Stanley was in fact co-written by Eastern
Natural Gas (the gas business of Eastern Electricity), Manweb Gas and Morgan
Stanley (the 'EMMS' group). All three companies contributed equally to the
structure and mechanics of the proposed market.
Your correspondent correctly stated that Morgan Stanley was involved in the
creation of the Natural Gas Clearinghouse, but we sold all interest in the
Natural Gas Clearinghouse in 1988.
Morgan Stanley is neither proposing nor advocating that Natural Gas
Clearinghouse or the IPE operates any structure relating to an operational
balancing or 'spot' market. Such a decision, if taken, would be made by the
gas industry as a whole.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Uzbekistan in pursuit of market
reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RUSTRAM AZIMOV
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to Steve Levine's article 'Uzbekistan courts 'His Majesty the
som' ' (July 2).
The west may wonder by what right the 'newly emerged' states can doubt the
prescriptions offered by developed countries, but this is to ignore the fact
that Uzbekistan is pursuing a transformation by means of its own strategy of
market reforms.
A favourable legal framework for market development has been created in
Uzbekistan. More than 50,000 enterprises have been privatised and the
proportion of national output produced by non-state enterprises is now a
third. Three years ago the state sector accounted for 100 per cent. The
practice of privileged loans to the state sector of the economy has been
stopped and a hard monetary policy adopted.
More than 1,000 joint ventures have been established. On May 5 1994 a law
was adopted offering foreign investors very favourable conditions, including
foreign investment risk insurance, and guarantees on the transfer of profits
and other funds in hard currency outside the republic without limitations.
The availability of credit facilities from the US, Germany, Japan, the UK,
France, Switzerland, Turkey and China indicates the degree of trust in our
policies. Many large companies invest in Uzbekistan. We expect stable growth
of investments in the coming years. One more fact supporting this predicted
trend is the convertibility of the som that started on August 1.
In the earlier article 'Flank left to fester' (February 16), Levine referred
to the lack of democratic rights and freedom in the central Asian countries.
I would suggest that 'musical comedy' opposition is not the best proof of
the presence of democracy. True democracy is being built over many decades
on the basis of the development of a market economy. After three years of
sovereignty, Uzbekistan has maintained its financial potential and is
gradually paving the way for a market economy.
The National Bank of Uzbekistan has established correspondent relations with
120 of the world's largest banks, it has become a member of the Swift,
Reuters and Visa and is involved in the development of foreign investments
worth more than USDollars 1bn. This allowed it to enter the top 1,000 banks
of the world, according to The Banker ranking (July 1994), where countries
of the former Soviet Union are presented only with Russian and Uzbek banks.
Government policy has the backing of the people of Uzbekistan, who have seen
that President Islam Karimov has been implementing policies to stabilise the
economy and strengthen the country's independence and have shown their
support with votes on the only true competitive presidential elections in
Central Asia.

VITAL SIGNS 1994-95
By Worldwatch Institute
Earthscan Publications Pounds 10.95, 164 pages
Any journalist covering the environment quickly discovers two things: it
brings a huge mail bag, but most of the information it contains is
unreliable. Figures on the health of the planet are now so manipulated by
lobby groups that it has become virtually impossible to finger the truth
with any certainty.
Worse still, it is now acceptable for governments to make environmental
policy on the so-called 'precautionary principle', which means assuming the
worst. This approach is said to be prudent, but it is little more than a
surrender to ignorance, which could be expensive and dangerous.
All of which makes any attempt to illuminate the subject in a calm and
considered way most welcome. Vital Signs, compiled by the Washington-based
Worldwatch Institute, is one of the few publications which can claim to fit
that category. This is the third edition of what has the makings of an
important book of reference, detailing in unemotional terms many key
planetary indicators: the quality of the air, production of food, energy
consumption, people's life expectancy, trends in plant and animal life, and
so on. When put together, they paint a very interesting picture - though not
one from which you could draw obvious conclusions.
There is a lot of bad news. The world grain harvest seems to be in long-term
decline, the air is getting dirtier, forests are shrinking, bird species are
down, and the number of pesticide-resistant insects is gaining (rather
alarmingly: 520 insects and mites are now wholly immune).
But if you prefer the good news, car production has fallen during the recent
recession while the number of bicycles has risen; meat output is keeping
pace with demand; the growth rate of the world population seems to have
peaked; cigarette consumption is down sharply and life expectancy up.
Your assessment of the meaning of all this rather depends on what you think
is important. There is a whole category of indicators which can be read
either way. What do you make of the fact that fertiliser use is falling? It
peaked in the late 1980s, and is now back at levels last seen in the
mid-1970s. This is obviously why grain output is falling too, though many
people must welcome the trend back to natural farming methods. (The whole
world could easily be fed, incidentally, if global grain yields were as high
as the UK's)
Another knotty one: the number of fish caught has levelled out, presumably
because fish are not reproducing fast enough. But fish farming is soaring.
Should we welcome a shift away from the ocean to artificial methods,
whatever their drawbacks, if that is a way of taking the pressure off
natural stocks?
Paper production is rising, and so, therefore, is logging. Yet more paper
than ever is being recycled, so the outlook is not all bad.
In the energy sector, source of so much environmental aggravation, oil
production is flat and coal is declining. The energy sources on the rise are
natural gas, renewables like solar, wind and, more controversially, nuclear
power, which is getting a big boost in the Far East. If the quality of the
atmosphere is your concern, these are all encouraging trends. Yet many
people would rather see coal replacing nuclear because they can understand
its risks better.
What the book brings out especially well is the complexity of the world's
natural systems - something that gets lost too easily in the heat of
environmental debate. Even though the authors only catalogue 50 trends, that
is quite enough to suggest the terrain within which rational discussion
might take place.
Take just one issue: global warming. Atmospheric concentrations of carbon
dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, are still rising. But annual emissions are
falling slightly, which means that the rate of increase in concentrations is
flattening out. The global average temperature was actually lower at the
beginning of this year than in 1991.
These may be short-lived trends which could easily be reversed as the world
economy pulls out of recession. On the other hand, the scope for cleaning up
dirty industries in former communist countries is enormous, and the trend
towards cleaner energy sources has already been noted.
The Worldwatch Institute's researchers go to some lengths to be objective,
and their commentaries are, on the whole, admirably balanced. Nonetheless,
you wonder why the book includes trends of little immediate relevance, such
as the level of gold production, the incidence of Aids, world defence
spending and UN peacekeeping activity, other than to imply that these are
somehow bad for the environment.
The environment debate is going to make more headway if participants stop
dragging in other campaigning issues simply to raise the emotional heat. It
would be more helpful if future editions carried indicators on the health of
the oceans, the availability of safe drinking water, trends in
desertification, and numbers on reforestation to balance the bad news on
felling. Also useful would be indications of the amount of land lost to
quarrying which, in its way, is much more destructive and irreversible than
forestry. In fact a shift from irreplaceable minerals to replaceable trees
in construction and manufacturing would be a rather healthy development.
You could also criticise the book for being too sweeping: it scarcely
matters that global population growth is easing if the trend is still
remorselessly upwards in the poorest countries. But quite enough is already
written about sectoral or regional problems. What Vital Signs can do is help
create a global consciousness about environmental issues. Many of them know
no boundaries, and require broader solutions than local agitators can
secure.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Job support scheme for disabled is a
concession, not a subsidy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HARPAL KUMAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report ('Whitehall error over disabled workers', August 17)
incorrectly links the Priority Suppliers Scheme, which Mr Portillo has just
scrapped, with 'subsidised schemes for the disabled'.
The Priority Suppliers Scheme allows companies employing mainly disabled
workers a chance to make a second bid for government contracts to match the
winning tender.
As such, it is not a subsidy but a concession.
Government contracts secured through the scheme are always at the lowest
price. Therefore, the government will achieve neither savings nor lower
tenders as a result of scrapping the scheme.
However, the jobs of hundreds of disabled people, such as the 200 people
employed in our supported workshops at Papworth, will in fact be put at risk
because, as you report, Whitehall officials made a mistake.
Mr Portillo and his officials should now move quickly to mitigate the worst
effects of the new directive, something they admit should have been done in
the first place.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Arts: Sensuous 'Antony and Cleopatra' - The Edinburgh
Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is far harder to explain the virtues of the Berliner Ensemble's account
of Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra at the King's Theatre than to explain
its flaws. The virtues lie almost all in the acting, which is marvellously
full of human truth and telling detail; and for me this carries the day
here.
The flaws are obvious, so I will rattle through them briskly. The play is
given in a modern German translation which seems to avoid either the metre
or phrasing of poetry. It runs at three hours and 35 minutes (shorter than
the advertised four hours]) without any interval. The director, Peter Zadek,
has put it into 1920s costumes (designed by Norma Moriceau), with Antony
donning Lawrence of Arabian headwear but, since there is no realistic
scenery, the detail of what each individual is wearing or carrying against
the vast sunbaked-yellow cyclorama of Wilfried Minks's set acquires a
distinctly absurdist quality. And Minks has provided a wooden floor on which
every movement makes such a clatter that the lines are sometimes inaudible.
The modern and intimate tone which is sustained throughout deprives the play
of any grandeur: when Cleopatra says 'The man hath seen some majesty, and
should know,' we may doubt her words.
The small-scaled and low-key performance that the Berliner actors deliver
within these considerable restrictions is one constantly alive with feeling
and character. Each role is absolutely distinct: even Decretas, who takes
the sword of the dying Antony and delivers it to Caesar, is vividly realised
in his mixture of shrewd opportunism, embarrassed awe, and shuffling
awareness that he is a tiny cog amid the massive wheels of history.
The most complex and riveting characterisations are those of Gert Voss and
Eva Mattes as Antony and Cleopatra. Mattes has great physical allure - like
a broader, more voluptuous and sexually charged Vivien Leigh. And she is
very much of the East: in one big scene of contrition to Antony, she
approaches him on her knees, hands behind her back, in the full Asiatic
demonstration of repentance. Though she lacks infinite variety - she can be
authoritative but not majestic - she certainly has an endlessly mobile
disposition. Voss shows Antony's rueful awareness of his own decline, his
ready appetite for all the pleasures of the flesh, and the expansive jovial
humanity that distinguishes him from other men even in his cups.
They make the title couple the most relaxed and humorous people in the play.
Their interpretations are full of beautifully telling detail. In one scene,
she cries and abases herself before him; he mimics her whimpering; whereupon
she promptly rises and slaps him. Moments later, his spirits restored, he
drinks and spouts a fountain of wine from his mouth into hers. After his
last defeat, she comes in to try allaying his humiliation - subdued, and yet
dignified in full regalia; he rejects her; she sticks her tongue out at him.
As with Judi Dench's great account of Cleopatra, it is this plenitude of
contrasts that makes Mattes captivating.
Other roles have similarly revealing strokes. When Caesar (Veit Schubert)
receives the news of Antony's death, he wipes his bloody sword dry while
choking back a sudden excess of emotion in his voice. His army is ordered,
whereas Antony's is wonderfully raggle-taggle. Charmian and Iras are all
irresponsibility: they practise a little Chaplinesque dance even in
preparation for battle, but later, when Cleopatra is Caesar's captive, they
perform a more seriously exotic dance, as if luring her away from politics
and the West into the sensuality of the East.
At all times the production reminds us that the East is the realm of the
senses and of self-gratification, the West the realm of self-control and
precise thought. It is Antony's tragedy that he is caught between the two,
but the play goes on to transcend any sense of tragic loss. Behind all the
action, Minks's cyclorama - in the aching hot yellow with which Picasso once
realised Spain onstage in Le Tricorne - glowingly speaks of heat, sand, sun,
and of a sensuous condition before which all politics and dominion are
petty.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Arts: Mad laughter in the face of death - Martin Hoyle
reviews three one-man shows on the Fringe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only Edinburgh at festival time could offer three one-man shows of such
diversity in one day. The settings are Russia, England and New York, the
performers British, Belgian and American. All three court mad laughter in
the face of death.
The Traverse has revived Moscow Stations. Stephen Mulrine's adaptation of
Venedikt Yerofeev's novel was a success last year and comes back with its
protagonist, Tom Courtenay, in unstoppable form.
Since the shock ending casts a retrospective shadow over the preceding
action, transforming it into a nightmare trip into eternity, I had forgotten
how funny much of the play is. This year Mulrine's version seems more
brilliantly apt than ever: it flows naturally, idiomatically, and convinces
in its portrayal of a society classless enough for strangers on a train to
discuss the bibulous propensities of Goethe and Schiller, the drink tragedy
of Mother Russia, and how Mussorgsky was happier lying drunk in a ditch than
completing Khovanshchina.
The travellers are portrayed as grotesques by the narrator, the author
himself, though how much credence we should give to Courtenay's beady-eyed
mockery is uncertain; for the plaintively carping Yerofeev is an alcoholic.
His gift for self-deprecation is defensive, getting in quickly to pre-empt
others. He also has a dash of that favourite Russian figure, the holy fool.
'God is good. I too am good and blessed,' he avers; and we even hear the
angelic voices that tell him how long it is to opening time and suggest that
he might try the station buffet until then.
Courtenay's great gift is the suggestion of vulnerable intelligence.
Terminally weary, haggardly whimsical, Yerofeev is just the sort of literate
social derelict to enrage the thugs who eventually kill him. Meanwhile he
entertains us with the never-ending train journey to Petushki.
The London Underground might do worse than adopt the Russian railway
inspector's penalty for those found without tickets: a gramme of vodka per
kilometre travelled. Failing vodka, he settles for cliff-hanging stories.
Thus Yerofeev has made his weekly trip for three years without paying,
holding the inspector spellbound with the spicier aspects of world history -
though arriving at Bush, Saddam Hussein and Thatcher, he decides there is
nowhere else to go.
Distorted perspective, ominous music and sensitive lighting evoke that urban
malaise and dream-like foreboding that are something of a speciality in Ian
Brown's direction. Courtenay shows his mettle as a great actor, and his
respect for 'other people's dark corners, even if there's nothing in them
but garbage' transforms that garbage into treasure.
In the studio space of Traverse 2, the late Derek Jarman goes rather more
gently into that good night. The young Belgian actor Kris Cuppens performs,
in only occasionally accented English, Modern Nature, an adaptation by Rudi
Meutemans of the film-maker's diaries. The Brussels premiere was attended by
Jarman himself late last year; he hoped to help the British production.
Opening with the diagnosis in 1986 that Jarman was HIV positive, the
reminiscences move forward to the cottage and beloved garden in Dungeness
and back to the peripatetic childhood. Boarding school, art college, early
sexual adventures; no bitterness: 'You won't hear me complaining. I'm
happy.' Kuppens' likeable performance is relaxed and natural, a mixture of
the character's no-nonsense insight and unquenched idealism: 'I've never
believed in the gold at the end of the rainbow. I still believe in the
rainbow, though.'
Jarman would have enjoyed Nicky, the hero of The Diary of a New York Queen,
inappropriately housed in the Church Hill Theatre with its austere church
hall atmosphere. At first Harold Finley, small, hyperactive and black, seems
a bit too much, too everything - eyes and teeth, screeching, mincing,
flouncing. But gradually there emerges a tightly-controlled and highly
stylised shape to Nicky's days and nights of work in theatrical costumes
(for a musical called Grind, directed by Hal Prince, no less), clubbing,
gossipping, insulting his long-suffering live-in boyfriend Harvey. Like
those other great diarists Charles Pooter and Adrian Mole, Nicky reveals as
much about himself as the world he chronicles.

THE MASK (PG) Charles Russell
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (15) Alex Cox
PUBLIC ACCESS Bryan J. Singer
In a startling raid on the American box office, a little-known man with a
mask and array of vocal disguises has climbed to the top of the charts.
Dislodging Arnold Schwarzenegger, Kevin Costner and Tom Hanks on the way, he
has already made off with over Dollars 100m. The law - the law of movie
probability, that is - stands helplessly by, seeking the breath to blow its
police whistle.
This has happened before: if only once in recent times. Two years ago a
cartoon genie with a similar fondness for high-speed 'schtick' and
smash-and-grab impersonations shinned to the top of the movie polls. But in
that film, Aladdin, the protean lamp-creature was voiced by the
crowd-pulling Robin Williams. In this week's The Mask we have Canadian-born
comic Jim Carrey, whom almost none of us have heard of: or if we have, only
as the man dusting for pawprints in the now forgotten romp Ace Ventura: Pet
Detective.
But the Chameleon Factor has worked again; 1990s audiences evidently go
dotty for fast-track metamorphosis played for mirth. Carrey is humble bank
employee Stanley Ipkiss, whose life is transformed when he stumbles on an
ancient mask (never mind how) with the power to re-mould (never mind why),
over and over and ad lib, its owner's appearance.
Abracadabra. From a human worker-ant in 'Edge City, USA,' a fantasy town
with a remarkable resemblance to Los Angeles, the Mittyish Mr Ipkiss can now
mutate at will. Mostly he turns into a dashing, yellow-suited, green-faced
lounge lizard with elastic limbs and organs - his eyes pop, his jaw drops
two feet, even his heart jumps out cartoon-like at the sight of a beautiful
girl - and a tendency to whirl tornado-like in and out of scenes. He gets
the girl (blonde and sumptuous Cameron Diaz). He gets the crooks. He
certainly gets the audience.
The special effects are - no hyperbole - astonishing. They are by Industrial
Light and Magic, the sorcery workshop founded by George 'Star Wars' Lucas.
If the art of optical magic goes on like this, Roger Rabbit will soon seem
like a flicker book from the Dark Ages and Snow White like a cave painting
animated by guttering firelight.
First cousin to Williams's genie, Jim Carrey gives as good vocally as he
gets visually. Edward G. Robinson, Clark Gable, James Cagney and others pour
from the larynx. (This is a 1940s-style crime plot with Carrey chasing a
gang of Warners-style crooks, so do not expect up-to-date impersonations).
And when our indestructible-when-masked hero performs a mock death scene
before the hoodlums who think they have gunned him down, we get a full
bouquet of 'famous last words' perennials in about 30 seconds flat.
Twangy-sentimental cowboy valediction; Tiny Tim cockney; even Rhett Butler
choking out 'Tell Scarlett I do give a damn.'
Virtuosic. And directed likewise by Charles Russell, a fugitive from the
Nightmare On Elm Street series. Our only quibble: a hundred minutes is a
long time to sit there being strafed by one performer, even one kissed with
talent, even one who slides in and out of the coat of many colours provided
by the FX folks. A chittering demon inside the spectator says, 'Yes, but
what is it all for?' The Mask is not so much a movie, more a feature-length
demo reel for the wonders of digital conjuring on screen. You end up
enthused by the product but wondering, before you take out your cheque book,
whether you should not wait a little longer while they improve the
story-packaging.
We still have not quite answered the question. Why do today's audiences like
this mach-2 metamorphic style so much? The other big hits of the summer in
America have been The Lion King, the new piece de prestidigitation from the
Disney animators, and Forrest Gump, in which Tom Hanks roams through time
being magicked by trick photography into encounters with the famous.
Have audiences become too quick, too screen-smart, to put up with the old
narrative dawdle, let alone the old po-faced naturalism? If a film is slow -
unless it is deep-down good - the cliches can be skewered and roasted by
filmgoers who have sharpened their wits on video and computer games. If a
film is un-self-aware, we have a generation who drank post-modernism with
their mother's milk. They know that in the ludic 1990s you can now have your
cake (disbelief-suspension) and eat it (munch on the make-believe tricks
whenever they expose themselves).
So we wonder if there is room for movies like the week's other duo, Highway
Patrolman and Public Access. British director Alex Cox's career is a hard
luck story. He used to make sportive films that broke the frame of
illusionism - the spoof Western Straight To Hell, the anachronism-stuffed
historical epic Walker - but they failed at the box office. So he has gone
to Mexico and back to the drawing-board.
Highway Patrolman (in Spanish with subtitles) is a straight-up genre movie:
part action thriller, part moral melodrama. Will our rookie police hero
(Robert Sosa) defy the corruption prevailing among his fellow cops and do
the brave and decent things out there on the blistering tarmac? Like
arresting drug dealers, shooting rabid dogs, and trying to find a joke in
Lorenzo O'Brien's solemnly righteous screenplay.
Cox provides a strong mise-en-scene, full of long takes and startling
landscapes. The climax at a crack-in-the-earth desert location is
marvellous. But in today's mercurial movie world, Highway Patrolman seems
almost dottily old-fashioned. As we watch the protagonist gain one martyring
handicap after another while the story racks up its reversals, from a facial
scar to a bullet-ridden limp, we feel we are back in the days of On The
Waterfront or The Defiant Ones: when good men did what they gotta do and
audiences sat there dumbly, drinking in the moral lessons.
Public Access is no better: indeed rather worse. Cox, we know, can make good
movies (Repo Man). But debut American director Bryan J. Singer seems able to
press only two letters on his creative keyboard. One is P for portentous, in
this tale of a young stranger (Ron Marquette) taking over a small town's
public-access TV network to spread malice, menace and finally murder. The
other is S for stilted, as the film's shadowy-paranoid style - Marquette may
be a right-wing provocateur - invokes the worst excesses of the
sanctimonious 1960s/'70s (The Parallax View, Winter Kills.)
Here it all is again. The belief that if you are not a decent liberal, you
are an indecent (and probably homicidal) redneck; that if you swathe a film
in chiaroscuro and score it for laconic dialogue, you have - hey presto] - a
film noir; that by explaining nothing about your mystery anti-hero, you will
make him a great existential icon.
There are worse things than a film that takes itself seriously. But there
are few worse things than a film that goes back to yesterday's fashions to
do so and fails utterly to renew those fashions for today.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Arts: A 'Figaro' tingling with life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One would have thought that enough versions of the Mozart operas had been
recorded in the composer's bicentenary year, but apparently not. Charles
Mackerras is recording another cycle in Scotland and the Edinburgh Festival
has once more jumped in to profit from the sessions.
This year was the turn of Le nozze di Figaro in a concert performance at the
Usher Hall on Monday. It is a long time since Mackerras presided as a
guardian of Mozart style in London and just how zestful he is in this
repertoire may be getting forgotten. His Figaro tingled with life in every
bar. With luck the Scottish Chamber Orchestra has absorbed Mackerras's
rhythmical and bracing way of playing Mozart as a permanent feature. If
nothing else, they are unlikely to forget how fast it goes. After
Runnicles's Mahler on the opening night, the festival has certainly made an
up-tempo start.
Being Mackerras, he is not content to conduct the same version of the opera
as everybody else. The research into ornamentation that he pioneered in the
1960s was further explored here, emphasising that the rhythm of the Italian
language should be paramount in how the music is sung. Furthermore, he gave
us some different arias from those we expect.
Not all his experiments worked. Carol Vaness's Countess, for one, would have
made a better impression in 'Dove sono' if she had been left to sing what we
usually hear, rather than the highly-decorated showpiece unearthed by
Mackerras. The alternative arias for Susanna - 'Un moto di gioia' and 'Al
desio' - are also less original than the usual pair, but at least Nuccia
Focile made a winning job of them.
It was the Italians in the cast who shone, because they fitted Mackerras's
conception of Figaro as a quick-fire comedy. Focile's Susanna, second cousin
to her Despina, was pert and quick-witted. Alessandro Corbelli, previously
known as a buffo baritone, is not a natural for the Count, but he made a
forceful figure, on the pompous side. Alfonso Antoniozzi was characterful as
both Bartolo and Antonio.
Carol Vaness has scored successes in the past with Mozart's active soprano
roles, but the passive nature of the Countess suited her less well. Simply
having to sing beautifully is not what she is best at. Despite biting into
the text, Alastair Miles is on the phlegmatic side for Figaro. Susanne
Mentzer's Cherubino lacked adolescent fire in his belly. For 'Voi che
sapete' she had been given intricate 18th-century embellishments written by
one Domenico Corri, a happy find. Corri lived in Edinburgh, so Mackerras had
made a handy Scottish connection.

Before we built a pond in our London garden we had no idea what fun it was
to keep frogs. Did you know that frogs from the same batch of spawn can
range from yellow through every shade of green and khaki to black? Turn on
the sprinkler at the opposite end of the garden and you get a miniature
Derby as the frogs leap off in the direction of the water. (How do they know
it is there?) According to Wild Britain (8.30 C4) a garden pond is the best
hope for amphibians in this country these days since it is unlikely to have
been contaminated by agricultural chemicals. To Catch A Killer is a two-part
account beginning today (10.00 BBC1) of the pursuit of John Wayne Gacy by
Detective Joe Kozenczak. Gacy was known for his charity work and had been
named Businessman Of The Year, but he also murdered 33 young men. That is
followed by a pilot programme for a new series showcasing comedians so far
unknown to television, The Stand Up Show (11.30). The Commonwealth Games
begin today in Victoria, Canada. At 8.00 BBC1 offers a preview in
Grandstand, and at midnight the opening ceremony live.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Technology: Identity in the picture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW DERRINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the UK goes ahead with plans to put photographs on driving licences, will
computers be able to check identity from a picture? The answer is yes, but
not very well. More reliable biometric identification systems - that can
identify people from biological data - use handprints, eye pictures or
fingerprints.
Computers can fail to recognise a face if lighting conditions or facial
expression change. Automated identification systems also use extra
information to improve reliability. Ben Miller, editor of Personal
Identification News, says biometric systems work best when combined with
identity cards and passwords.
Under these circumstances even an unreliable biometric identification system
may have a beneficial effect. This is the context in which face
identification systems are useful.
There are two kinds of error: false acceptances and false rejections.
Identification is tested by comparing two sets of numbers which can be
identity card numbers, PINs, or numbers derived from biometric data. False
acceptances can only be reduced by requiring the numbers to be very similar,
which increases false rejections.
Because the false rejection rate rises as the false acceptance rate falls, a
useful benchmark is the 'crossover', where the two error rates are equal.
Automated recognition of hand shape gives a crossover of one in 500, says
Miller.
There are no reliable estimates for the crossover for face recognition -
even from manufacturers selling systems. Informed guesses suggest a level of
about one in 20.
The importance of the two kinds of error are different. Miller says several
UK banks are very interested in biometric recognition systems. They will
allow a false acceptance rate of one in 20, but want to keep the false
rejection rate below one in 100,000. Unfortunately, no biometric recognition
system has yet met these requirements.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A reversal of
fortune - East Germans have lost their insatiable appetite for all things
western
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It seemed like a marketing dream come true in the early days of German
unification. East German manufacturers and west German advertising agencies
looked on in wonder as consumer-starved east Germans rushed out with their
newly exchanged currency.
East Germans packed their apartments and kitchens with west German video
recorders and washing machines, stereos and food mixers. They sampled
western brands ranging from washing powder and toothpaste to cigarettes,
water, beer, confectionery and soap. You name it, they bought it.
'East Germany's local producers did not know how to respond to this
avalanche of west German consumer goods,' says Sebastian Turner, manager of
the Berlin-based Scholz &amp; Friends advertising and marketing firm, a
subsidiary of the New York-based Bates Worldwide.
'They had no idea what competition meant. The pace at which west German
goods entered the untapped east German market actually helped to destroy
some east German products.'
But not completely. Four years after German unification, east German
consumer habits are shifting - and east German products are returning to the
department stores' shelves.
The first reason for this reversal in consumer spending is economic. The
high rate of unemployment among east Germans - officially 16 per cent - and
insecurity about future job prospects have encouraged east Germans to save.
According to the Bundesbank, savings last year took 13 per cent of their
disposable income compared with 14 per cent in west Germany.
As a result west German advertisers could no longer rely on the east German
consumer's insatiable demand for west German products, and they had to
respond accordingly.
Stephan Becker-Sonnenschein from the Munich-based Self Promotion Services,
which markets Philip Morris cigarettes, explains the strategy his agency has
adopted: 'When Philip Morris bought up large sections of east Germany's
cigarette producers, it decided to keep its prices for east German brands
below west German prices. This partly explains why east Germans are again
buying f6 cigarettes, an old east German brand owned by Philip Morris. f6
cigarettes now have 30 per cent of the entire east German market.'
But it is not only the price of a product which has caused the shift back
from west to east German products.
'The east Germans were made to believe that every western product tasted
better while everything eastern was pretty awful. Yet over the past few
years, they have been going back to some of their own brands. We would not
dare substitute that black tobacco of f6 with an American tobacco. It would
not sell,' says BeckerSonnenschein.
Responding to a return to traditional east German tastes, Philip Morris
maintained the old style of the f6 cigarette box as well as the tobacco.
'We revamped the packaging for environmental reasons and introduced some
more ranges, such as lighter cigarettes. But the old familiar pack  - and
the smell of that black tobacco - remains the same.'
As east Germans went back to their old products, west German advertising
agencies had to reconsider their marketing strategies.
They may find a lesson in the success of Henkel, one of Germany's largest
washing powder manufacturers. It entered the east German market soon after
unification by buying Spee, a household name among east German washing
powders.
Henkel could not rely on market research for the selection of its strategy
because such processes had not been established in the former communist
days.
Anke Paech, head of production at Henkel, says that the company decided to
stress the 'continuity' of Spee. Its first advertising slogan was 'The good
Spee - we are from here (east Germany)'. It also kept the price competitive.
More important, Henkel emphasised that the east German-manufactured washing
powder was the 'first all-German washing powder', which was intended to show
east Germans they could produce products appealing to the west.
Henkel has now captured 28 per cent of the east German washing powder
market, further evidence, perhaps, of a growing east German patriotism and
confidence in their own products, even if many are backed by west German
enterprises.
Turner sees another trend evolving among east German consumers which is
affecting the way west Germans market their products in the five eastern
states.
'You can talk about the east Germans turning back to their own products. And
this is true, but only up to a point. The reality is that 80 per cent of
consumer goods in east Germany still consist of west German brands.
'However, if there is any long-term trend developing, it is this: the
emergence of regionalism, the rebirth of the local product. That is exactly
what had emerged in west Germany since the second world war. But in east
Germany, because everything was state-owned and distributed through state
channels, there was little scope for regionalism or regional products.'
It is almost impossible to ignore the growing importance of regional
products. The Saxons opt for Radeberger beer which is brewed in Dresden, the
Thuringians indulge in their famous sausage, the Saxon-Anhalts consume
Rotkappchen, a sparkling wine which has made a remarkable recovery in the
past two years, the Brandenburgers favour their own dairy products.
Supermarkets and food chains in east Germany and Berlin are responding to
these trends. KaDeWe, Berlin's most fashionable department store and one of
the first to tap the regional culinary strengths of east Germany, now stocks
between 600 and 700 east German items out of the 3,000 products sold on its
luxurious sixth-floor food hall.
'The Berliners want the local products,' says Norbert Kronacke, head of
KaDeWe's fruit and vegetable division.
'For the first time since the second world war west Berliners have an Umland
(surrounding countryside). The Berlin Wall cut them off from this. Since
unification they have been able to buy locally produced food, game and fish.
It is cheaper, does not have to be imported and the taste is fresher.'
Turner believes that the east German market still offers potential for west
Germans and outsiders. 'The east Germans will buy a product if there is a
rational reason to do so. This amounts to offering a good price and quality.
The east Germans are price-conscious and sensible about how they spend their
money.'
Turner says anyone still wanting to enter the east German market should keep
their message direct and avoid being arrogant. Above all 'you have to know
the local culture and traditions because regional products are playing an
increasing role in the consumer habits of the east Germans. Just like in
west Germany'.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Technology: Risks of freedom - As computer systems become
more accessible so they become more vulnerable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM CLAYTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Heads of information technology departments are being offered a new weapon
in their continuing battle against breaches of security. This is highly
sophisticated software which gives precise control over which parts of an IT
network users can access.
Two types of problem arise when individuals are free to roam around
sprawling computer networks. First, there is the danger of unauthorised
access to confidential information. Second, and even more worrying, is the
possibility of havoc caused by a disgruntled employee - a growing breed in
organisations which are 'downsizing'.
Yet as security is tightened throughout an organisation, the process starts
to conflict with the underlying purpose of IT - to make information
available to users as widely, easily and quickly as possible. This is the
aim of rapidly expanding technologies such as Electronic Document Management
(EDM) in which letters from clients are scanned and put into electronic
files, together with replies written on a word processor or any other
information in electronic form.
When M&amp;G, the UK investment management company, began looking at EDM,
quality of service to the customer came top of its list of priorities. 'With
EDM,' explains Adrian Sharp, manager of management services at M&amp;G, 'any
individual can take a call from a client and immediately have the right file
in front of him or her.'
The problem faced by developers of new security software such as Wang's
Enhanced System Access Controls or ICL's AccessManager is to maintain that
freedom while providing a high level of security. 'The key,' says Roger
Ashbrook, general manager of ICL Secure Systems, 'is to think about the
function of each employee and the information he or she needs from the
computer network.'
Using this approach, AccessManager offers users single password access to
all parts of an IT system for which they are authorised, no matter how
complex the computer network may be. In addition, it can be set up to work
with other authentication devices such as badge readers and cards.
In the battle to prevent security breaches, hardware and software
developments represent only one element. A recent Department of Trade and
Industry survey, carried out in conjunction with ICL and the National
Computing Centre and covering 800 respondents from a wide cross-section of
UK industries, showed what else was needed by IT departments as they
struggled with problems ranging from fraud and sabotage to power failure and
operator errors.
One obvious step towards improving security is proper contingency planning,
but the survey suggests that of all breaches reported by respondents, only
about half were covered by such a plan. However, where a plan did exist,
almost all the respondents believed it had been at least moderately
effective in minimising the problem and had helped them recover from it.
In this area, many financial organisations have no excuse for failure
because the Bank of England and regulatory authorities insist that they must
have contingency plans and sites and that these are regularly tested.
'Before recent terrorist bombings,' says Mike Nicholls, IT manager at the
Bank of Ireland, 'people didn't appreciate that access to a building may be
impossible for a long time, preventing access to such things as vital data
held in a fire-proof safe.'
Another obvious step is to ensure that an individual is directly responsible
for security. Here the survey presents a depressing picture, warning that
the proportion of organisations with specialist security personnel may be as
low as 15 per cent, although this rises to one-third in the financial
sector.
These are figures which surprised and disturbed Nicholls. 'Within the
financial community,' he says, 'ignoring IT security is like having
unprotected sex - sooner or later the consequences will catch up with you'.
The survey is the second in two years and so gives some indication of
trends. For example, a quarter of respondents reported thefts of equipment,
a sharp increase on the 14 per cent two years ago. Over one-third suffered
computer virus attacks, double the figure recorded in the previous survey.
The cost of a failure, including investigation and repairing the damage to
data or equipment, works out on average at a little under Pounds 10,000. But
when things do go wrong, particularly in the financial sector, they can go
very wrong - as one insurance company discovered when a fraud cost it Pounds
1.2m, the most financially damaging breach reported in the survey.
An encouraging aspect is that after manufacturing, the largest number of
respondents came from the financial and services sectors, where companies
have often been reluctant to discuss IT security openly. There have been
exceptions such as National Westminster Bank, which after experiencing
multiple debiting on some cardholder accounts, acknowledged the problem,
apologised to customers and arranged compensation.
This is in stark contrast to the hostility which has grown around the issue
of phantom withdrawals from automatic teller machines. Initially the
companies tried to put the blame on the customers. While this was correct in
many cases, the eventual removal of the full account number from receipts
showed that there was scope for improvement in the security of the system.
With a widely established network and more than 3m transactions a day, ATMs
are a natural target. Having tried frontal assaults with mechanical diggers,
criminals are adopting more ingenious approaches to breaching security; in
one recent case, a 'dummy' ATM was set up to collect customers' account
numbers and personal identification numbers.
As ICL's Ashbrook points out, the use of computer systems is expanding
rapidly, particularly in the financial sector. The use of teleworking is
also growing, meaning that systems have to be more accessible and thus more
vulnerable. He expects the consequences of these developments to show up in
the next survey.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Toyota's drive for
the 20-somethings - How the car company has tapped into a new market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Targeting Japan's 20-somethings has become part of the answer to the
conundrum facing Toyota Motor, the country's leading car maker: how to
revive its faltering sales and profits.
The company has tapped into Japan's dankai nisei - translated as the 'second
mass generation' - to sell Rav 4, its new recreational vehicle. Thanks to
surging demand for the car, the company's domestic sales and production in
June were higher than a year before for the first time for 13 months.
With their large disposable income, the 8m men and women in their late teens
and 20s - the children of the baby boomers in their 40s - are fast becoming
the core of Japan's consumer market.
Hideki Hashimoto, general manager of Toyota's advertising and marketing
department, says unlike the widely held image of Japanese consumers, the
20-somethings are not necessarily brand conscious, although they have an eye
for quality.
'The dankai nisei doesn't perceive a car as a status symbol like the older
generation. They want something casual - not too posh and not too macho -
which they can drive in the city or in the countryside,' he says.
Following the recent boom in multi-purpose vehicles, Toyota developed the
car in order to cater for increasing demands for a cheaper and smaller
recreational vehicle. At Y1.7m (Pounds 11,100), Rav 4 costs around half as
much as most recreational vehicles thanks to lower development and design
costs achieved by using the same parts from other cars. For example, Rav 4
shares its engine and steering wheel designs with Celica, a sports car, and
a common door mirror is used for both Rav 4 and Carina, a four-door sedan.
Another factor behind the car's cheaper price is lower profit margins at the
dealer level. In an unprecedented move, Toyota's car dealers agreed to lower
the retail margins for Rav 4 in order to increase sales.
Toyota says it started planning the promotional campaign a year ahead of the
car's launch. After introducing it in two consecutive motor shows, the
marketing team noted the crowds of young people it attracted. The team
studied filmed interviews of auto show visitors, and decided to focus its
promotional efforts on consumers in their 20s.
But while the company wanted to leave a strong impression with its campaign,
it was also careful not to be too pushy, since younger consumers are more
confident of their own tastes and dislike being told what is good.
'We wanted to communicate specifically to this generation, so we included an
element of entertainment,' says Hashimoto. Toyota spent more than 1.5 times
the cost of an ordinary promotion campaign, sponsoring events such as
basketball games and mountain bike races in shopping areas popular among
teenagers and people in their early 20s.
Using comics has also been an effective promotional strategy. Toyota bought
eight pages of Shonen Jump, a weekly comic magazine which offers a range of
stories from sports to the more lurid type. Shonen Jump's circulation totals
6.3m, which comes in third after 10m for Yomiuri Shimbun and 8m for Asahi
Shimbun, two leading mainstream news dailies.
'These days even universities and companies use comics for textbooks and
manuals, and we wanted to use this trend effectively,' says Hashimoto.
Toyota also placed ads in the television programme pages of leading
newspapers, while tying up with a popular sports club in placing advertising
features in magazines.
A leading attraction of Rav 4, apart from the price, is the 130 optional
accessories which can be added to the vehicle. Customers can use computers
in showrooms to look through CD-Rom catalogues and simulate creating their
own personal vehicle - a feature which has appealed to the younger
generation.
Thanks to the promotional efforts, orders for the car in June totalled
17,000 units, 8.5 times the original monthly target of 2,000. The production
line is now operating at weekends to meet demand, while consumers wanting to
buy Rav 4 need to wait until October due to the backlog of orders.
In spite of Rav 4's popularity, Toyota's marketing team is not relaxing its
promotional efforts. It says only 20 per cent of the orders are from women.
'Our next task is to try to attract female customers by using women's
magazines,' says Hashimoto.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Technology: Skids on Japan's motorway noise - A look at a
new material which absorbs sound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW DERRINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A small company in northern England is hoping to develop an interest in the
Japanese motorway system. Sound Absorption, based in Lancashire, has
appointed Hitokuchi Zaka Studios as the Japanese distributor for its
acoustic cladding material, Coustone, which it hopes will be used for
motorway sound screens.
Coustone is made from flint particles bonded together with resins. It has
excellent acoustic properties, as it both absorbs and insulates sound. But
its physical robustness makes Coustone particularly suitable for highway
sound barriers.
The key to Coustone's sound-absorbing properties is the existence of
air-filled spaces between the flint particles. Spaces allow sound to enter
the material instead of being reflected, and are a feature of sound
absorbers.
In buildings where acoustic quality is very important, such as concert
halls, resonant cavities may be incorporated into the structure. These
absorb the sound, which can be monitored with a microphone and fed back
through a loudspeaker, allowing electronic control of acoustic quality.
Simpler sound-absorbing materials are usually porous or fibrous substances.
The sound-deadening effects of curtains and human bodies are
a matter of everyday experience.
Mineral wool is widely used when sound absorption must be incorporated into
a building's structure. Substances used in Japan include glass wool,
ceramics, foamed concrete, aluminium fibre and sintered aluminium.
None of the alternative sound-absorbing materials is as strong as Coustone,
according to Toshio Obayashi, of CI Kasei, a Tokyo engineering firm which
has used the material on a number of building projects. Sales in the UK have
also depended heavily on its non-acoustic properties, according to Mike
Hadfield of Sound Absorption.
Coustone's acoustic properties are suitable for television or radio
recording studios, but the fact that it can be scrubbed and even sterilised
makes it popular as a sound-absorbing cladding for police interview rooms.
Since the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, UK interview rooms have to be
suitable for sound recording but have always posed difficult cleaning
problems.
Sound transmission can be effectively blocked by any heavy material. Sound
consists of a vibration, or pressure wave, travelling through the air.
Anything heavier than air needs more energy to make it vibrate, and so can
be used to make a barrier. Motorway sound screens in the UK are made of
wood. Most of the sound that strikes a wooden fence is reflected.
The limitation of materials such as wood or concrete for noise barriers is
that reflecting sound does not remove it. The sound merely returns to its
source, from where it can be reflected again. Reflections are a nuisance in
sound recording, because they reduce clarity, but they also increase sound
volume.
Coustone's combination of cleanability, ruggedness and sound absorption have
won favour in swimming pools, factories and indoor firing ranges in this
country.
It was selected for use in police firing ranges because of its resistance to
ricocheting bullets. But sound reflections are a severe problem in an indoor
range: the direct report of each shot is literally only half the problem.
The sound is reflected from the walls, the ceiling and the floor, as well as
travelling directly.
Noise exposure regulations limit the number of shots heard by each
instructor. Acoustic measurements show that in a firing range panelled with
Coustone the reduction in sound reflection roughly doubles the number of
shots that the instructor can hear.
Sound absorption is also considered important for motorway noise screens in
Japan. Highways run through densely populated areas, so the noise-reducing
effects of sound-absorbing barriers are more important. Noise screens up to
8m high have been constructed around motorways in Tokyo.

FT  18 AUG 94 / People: Jecks leaves KB to return to Lloyds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Keith Jecks, 37, who was responsible for marketing Kleinwort Benson's
private banking business, is quitting following a reorganisation of group
marketing strategy.
Jecks, managing director, London, of Kleinwort Benson Private Bank, will, in
October, return to Lloyds Bank's fund management arm to the new post of
chief operating officer of Lloyds Investment Managers which has Pounds 10bn
under management.
Jecks, an actuary, joined Lloyds in August 1986 to head the marketing of its
investment management business. Three years later he moved to Kleinwort
Benson Investment Management as business development director and was later
posted to New York.
George Alford, head of Kleinwort's private banking division, says Jecks is
not being replaced directly. However, Steven Taylor, 45, takes over
responsibility for marketing the private banking division and Jecks' other
sales force responsibilities will be shared among other executives.
Jecks' departure is one of a number of changes at Kleinwort Benson Private
Bank. Nicholas Haynes, 43, general manager of Banque Kleinwort Benson SA in
Geneva is returning to London as head of private client portfolio
management. He will work in tandem with William Steel, 59, until he retires
in a year's time.
Haynes has been replaced in Geneva by Michael Allen, 54, who has been
responsible for KB's north American financing business.

chairman of the Confederation of British Industry's Training Policy Panel.
Buse, 49, was among the active promoters of the Investors in People standard
at the retail division of WH Smith. He joined the group in 1962. A certified
accountant, he was chief accountant from 1979 to 1984 when he became
managing director of the news division. He was appointed managing director
of Do-It-All in May 1988 and became group personnel director in April 1991.
According to Roy Harrison, head of training at the CBI, 'Training issues
currently have a high profile, with employers looking for major pay-offs
from their training investment, and the CBI is actively involved in many key
initiatives in this area.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Laurel Powers-Freeling is moving from Prudential to life assurance group
Lloyds Abbey Life where, at the age of 37, she will become the first female
group finance director in British insurance.
An American, Powers-Freeling had worked as director of corporate strategy
and planning for the Pru, helping the board reach its decision not to expand
into Europe.
She had then expressed the wish to try her hand at line management. Slightly
less than a year ago, she set up a division concentrating on private
financial planning services, an attempt to reach wealthier customers. But
the experience left her feeling she was 'better in the long run operating at
the broader strategic level'.
In March the Pru hired John Maxwell as corporate development director.
She has been promised a strong strategic slant to her new job, sorting out
what she hints is at present something of a rag bag of businesses. As for
the nitty gritty of the finance function, she points out that she does have
a masters in finance from MIT, and that she has had to understand the
accounting aspects of the industry in her previous incarnations.
Before joining the Pru three years ago, she had worked at investment bank
Morgan Stanley International and management consultants McKinsey.
Lloyds Abbey Life has been looking for a finance director since last
September when Christopher Wiscarson was moved across to another part of the
group, becoming managing director of Black Horse Financial Services.

account
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ministers currently on holiday on the Continent might fret about the UK
balance of payments deficit. They will probably not reflect on their part in
creating it. Foreign holidays helped push the UK into a Pounds 3.1bn deficit
on the tourism account last year.
Sir John Egan, chief executive of BAA, the airports group, wants to help
return the tourism account to surplus. He has been named chairman of the
Confederation of British Industry's Tourism Action Group. He is already
chairman of the London Tourist Board and a member of the board of the
British Tourist Authority. His interest is natural, he says. Most visitors
to and from the UK pass through his airports.
His new role follows the CBI's decision to become more closely involved in
tourism, one of the UK's biggest industries. The problem is not so much one
of attracting foreigners to the UK; a record 20m are expected this year. The
difficulty is persuading more Britons to take their holidays at home. Sir
John (below) says much of the problem is that UK tourist facilities are
often of low standard and represent poor value for money.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Accountancy: Young, free and single-mindedly deceptive - A
look at the implications for firms supervising staff after the Nicholas
Young case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The high-spending existence of Nicholas Young came to an abrupt and
unpleasant end one summer's day four years ago with his arrest by the
police. Life for those around him has altered just as painfully but rather
more slowly and less conclusively since then.
From 1974, Young had held the senior administrative role at an organisation
known latterly as Clark Kenneth Leventhal (CKL), an international network of
accountancy firms including Clark Whitehill in the UK.
But he was spending much of his time in and out of Clark Whitehill's London
offices dealing with 'investors' - including his mother and friends - to
whom he promised high returns from a series of complex and confidential
funds invested offshore.
Young, the son of the Queen's chaplain, spent some of the money on his
extravagant personal lifestyle, and frittered away the rest on an elaborate
and ultimately futile horse-racing betting system. He spent more than Pounds
10.9m on bets since 1985 alone, recouping just Pounds 8.7m.
One of the many ironies of the Young saga is that his ambitious deception
could take place on the premises and under the very noses of a number of
highly skilled audit partners at Clark Whitehill, which numbers among its
clients the Financial Reporting Council.
Another is the fact that Young himself had previously held the position as
assistant secretary of the disciplinary committee at the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. This very body has just
delivered its verdict on Mr Brian Worth, Young's supervisor. One of the
great sadnesses of the story is that while the criminal action has proved
relatively swift, the pursuit of professional discipline and civil
compensation have proved tortuously slow.
Young was jailed for four years in 1991 after being found guilty on charges
of making misleading, false and deceptive statements, and deception and
forgery. Within 19 months he was free.
That leaves more than 60 investors out of pocket by more more than Pounds
8.5m. Five have since died. With no chance of recovering their money from
Young, the survivors have launched legal actions against CKL and Clark
Whitehill, both of which deny responsibility. The case is now scheduled to
begin in January 1996.
Meanwhile, last week an appeal upheld last year's verdict of the Institute's
disciplinary committee against Mr Worth, a Clark Whitehill partner and the
chairman of CKL at the time the deceptions were unearthed. He was
'admonished' and ordered to pay costs of Pounds 1,000 for his failure to
adequately supervise Young.
The committee concluded that Worth had not made 'adequate inquiries' of
Young, and the resulting 'incompetence' was 'of such a degree that it would
have caused concern and surprise to most right-thinking members of the
public'.
The question is not so much whether Mr Worth, Clark Whitehall and CKL knew
about Young's fraud in advance of his arrest, but whether they should have
discovered it long before the unexpected arrival of a writ from the first of
many disgruntled investors in 1990. There have to be at the very least some
questions about the gullibility of the Young investors. His promises sound
all too familiar to a public now more used to the financial shenanigans of
the late 1980s: inadequately explained and ridiculously high returns, the
need to maintain utter discretion, the lack of any authorisation from a
professional body, and the amateurish style of many of his circulars to
investors.
But the victims do have one powerful retort: they maintain that Young had
the necessary credibility partly because he appeared to be working on behalf
of a reputable firm of chartered accountants rather than simply in his
personal capacity.
There are many letters written by Young to his 'clients' on letterheads from
the firm. There are numerous telephone messages and other signs that he took
numerous calls at work.
The relatively small amount of stationery used in these unauthorised ways
might have been difficult for the firm to detect. The forged representations
that he periodically made in partners' names would prove even more opaque to
unearth.
The apparent volume of correspondence and callers at the firm's offices
might have raised some suspicions, however. It seems that letters sent there
included tipsters' sheets with names such as 'Tru-tu-form'. None of his post
was opened by others, which might have triggered suspicions. The partners
seemed to make few inquiries into how Young was able to finance his
lifestyle - apparently spending more than Pounds 1m a year - when he earned
a relatively modest CKL salary. More concerning is the fact that no-one
picked up on the scale or nature of his activities at the lunches hosted by
Young for both Clark Whitehill partners and outside contacts such as
potential investors and bankers who were involved in his private client
dealings.
Young even had such correspondence with a manager at the Bank of Scotland in
Edinburgh who is the brother of Mr Jim Gemmel, the firm's managing partner.
One partner connected to CKL did have a closer understanding of what was
going on. Mr Bengt Bangstad, head of the network's Swedish firm, who is now
being sued by the investors, confirmed in a letter to a potential investor
in 1987 that Young was providing him with investment returns in excess of 21
per cent a year. He apparently did not pass this information on to other
partners.
Separately, an Isle of Man accountant also wrote to Mr Worth in 1989 making
inquiries on behalf of a client interested in a high-yielding investment,
and saying that he had as a reference Young as the relevant 'partner' with
Clark Whitehill.
The issue of most concern to the Institute's disciplinary committee seems to
have been the evidence that Young was carrying out private activities at his
office. He paid CKL Pounds 750 a month, rising to Pounds 800, for use of
space and equipment for his own work. The amounts are shown in the accounts.
An accounts clerk queried these payments in 1985. Brian Worth says he did so
more recently. Both received replies from Young that he paid bills and
performed clerical work for a number of unidentified friends based overseas.
Neither pursued the matter.
The disciplinary committee concluded that Mr Worth had a responsibility to
supervise all Young's activities, including his private ones, and should not
have relied on his initial 'inadequate explanation'.
It seems that Young also paid his successive secretaries a top-up each month
for carrying out his personal work. They were aware of the nature of his
private work, although it seems did not speak to anyone else in the firm
about it.
Mr Jim Gemmel argues that the amounts paid by Young to CKL were immaterial
in view of the organisation's turnover, that that he was a trusted employee
whom no-one had cause to disbelieve and who was an extremely artful
deceiver, and that Worth was based in Birmingham with the supervision of
Young in London just a small part of his role.
'You can be awfully clever with hindsight,' he says. 'I really do not think
any other professional walking into these circumstances would have done
anything different.'
How far the courts agree may be unclear for another 16 months or more. In
the meantime, other firms would do well to note the attitude of the
disciplinary committee, and to consider their own procedures for monitoring
the activities of staff, opening correspondence, supervising secretaries and
generally keeping their eyes open. As Mr Gemmel says: 'I keep thinking,
there but for the grace of God go I'

FT  18 AUG 94 / Minister warns signal workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dr Brian Mawhinney, the transport secretary, yesterday warned the RMT
transport union that public sympathy for striking rail signalling workers
could 'snap' as he urged them to drop their claim for an interim payment.
He insisted that the government's public-sector pay policy would not change
and said signal workers had already been rewarded for past productivity
gains. 'Everyone is getting fed up with the disruption and inconvenience
these needless strikes are causing to travellers, industry and the railway
industry itself. Public patience can be elastic, but even elastic can snap,'
he said.
Meanwhile, the dispute is threatening to dominate this year's Trades Union
Congress when it opens on September 5.
Mr John Monks, the general secretary, denied yesterday that this would
embarrass the TUC, which is being modernised and plans a relaunch at
Blackpool.
He said: 'The signal workers have widespread support in the trade union
movement as well as among the public.'
Mr Monks accused Railtrack, the state-owned company which owns the rail
network, of being an 'incompetent and arrogant' employer.
Last night Railtrack said that 16.5 per cent of the 4,600 signal workers had
returned to work during this week's 48-hour stoppage.
It said the numbers going back were 25 per cent in East Anglia, 19 per cent
in the north-east of England, 15 per cent in Scotland and the south of
England and nearly 20 per cent in the Great Western zone.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Gatwick rail ticket sales are probed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rail industry regulator is investigating claims that arrangements for
selling tickets at Gatwick Airport station discriminate against some of the
train operators involved, it emerged yesterday.
This is the first investigation by Mr John Swift QC, the rail regulator,
under rules for the privatisation of the network.
His decision could have far-reaching implications for the rival railway
companies which are expected to take over the running of former British Rail
operations during the next two years.
Three companies run trains from Gatwick station to central London. Gatwick
Express runs a dedicated service between the airport andLondon Victoria;
Network SouthCentral runs between London and the south coast; and Thameslink
runs services between Brighton and Bedford via London Bridge.
Passengers travelling through Gatwick have complained about confusion over
the sale of tickets, saying it is not always possible to compare the prices
and times of the competing companies.
The regulator's office said it was 'undertaking inquiries to establish the
facts following a number of representations from train-operating companies'.
The regulator has a duty to see that companies which operate stations do not
discriminate against other train operators using their stations. It can
order a station operator to remedy activities thought to discriminate and,
if action is not taken, impose a fine.
The Office of Franchising Director, responsible for selling rail franchises,
said it had asked the regulator to clarify arrangements for selling tickets
at Gatwick station a month ago. 'It was important to clarify the position
before franchises are sold off,' the franchising director's office said.
'Tickets should be sold impartially. We welcome the regulator's review.'
Gatwick Express, which is expected to be one of the first train-operating
units to be franchised to the private sector, and Network SouthCentral
declined to comment.
Thameslink was not available for comment last night.
The rail regulator's office said: 'We are poring over it. Hopefully a
decision will not take much longer.'

FT  18 AUG 94 / Farmers query EU 'mad cow' decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tenant farmers and land-owners are seeking urgent clarification of new
European rules on British beef exports, fearing they may affect far more
herds than intended and damage the market for land.
The restrictions, imposed by European agriculture ministers last month to
counter bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or 'mad cow disease', say
beef carcasses may be exported only if they come from farms free of the
disease for six years.
Mr Marshall Taylor, chairman of the Tenant Farmers' Association, said that
because they applied to holdings rather than herds, the rules were likely to
hit more than the 52 per cent of dairy herds that had suffered from BSE.
He accused the government of returning from Brussels with 'a major banana
skin'.
The Ministry of Agriculture said last night that it accepted that there were
anomalies in the rules. 'We intend to seek changes in the wording to take
account of the effect on the sale or hire of land,' it said.
The restriction on farms rather than herds revives the question of whether
the disease can be transmitted to one animal from another, or from a
substance left on land used by diseased cattle.
BSE is thought to have been caused by infected animal protein in cattle
feed. The use of such protein was banned in 1988 and the incidence of the
disease is declining.
But the European Commission's scientific veterinary committee, which drew up
the restrictions, refused to rule out other possible causes. It said the
question of transmission from cow to calf or one animal to another was 'not
settled'.
Mr Taylor, a tenant farmer who has had about 15 BSE cases in his 150-strong
Somerset dairy herd, said the rules suggested a BSE-free herd could be
blighted by grazing on land shared with a contaminated herd, or grazed by
such a herd in the past. Undiseased herds grazing on common land could be
affected by the rules if a BSE-affected herd also uses the land.
Landlords might let only to tenants with a BSE-free herd, or demand
compensation from departing tenants for blighting farms with an affected
herd. 'It may become quite an issue for landlords and affect the rental
value of the property.'
The Country Landowners' Association also said it was concerned by the rules.
British Airways is to stop carrying live animals for slaughter after
protests from customers concerned about the livestock, the airline announced
yesterday. The ban is to start immediately.
BA said it would continue to carry pets and animals being moved for purposes
other than slaughter.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Security groups to outnumber police
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The growing private security industry employs about as many personnel as all
the police forces in England, Wales and Scotland, a research study has
shown.
The number employed by the industry has grown from 115,000 in 1985 to
162,000 today - a rise of about 45 per cent in seven years.
The statistics were produced by the Policy Studies Institute as part of a
wider study into aspects of crime by the Economic and Social Research
Council.
The PSI study, based on data from British Telecommunication's Business
Database and the government's Labour Force Survey, is believed to be the
first comprehensive look at the size and shape of the private security
industry.
The study includes a variety of security businesses such as security
equipment specialists, private detectives and credit investigation services.
It estimates that there are at least 7,842 such establishments employing
more than 162,000 people. Researchers, however, believe this is likely to
underestimate the true figure.
The figure of 162,000 compares with 142,000 trained police officers employed
by forces in England, Scotland and Wales. This increases to 191,000 if
civilian staff attached to police forces are included.
The PSI study will continue for a further year, concentrating on greater
sectoral analysis of the industry and its relationship with public-sector
policing.
Researchers believe its initial conclusions demonstrate the growth in the
industry and the need for statutory regulation.
At present the industry is regulated by trade associations and professional
bodies which, the PSI says, cover only a fraction of the companies
operating.
Mr Tim Newburn of the PSI said: 'There has been a growth in the number of
police officers, a growth in the private security sector, a growth in the
crime rate, and a growth in the public's desire for protection, all at the
same time.
'It would appear that these trends will fuel a continued expansion in
private security. But, although the industry is already as big as the police
force and is set to get bigger and have a significant impact on our everyday
lives, there is no regulation over its activities.'
Mr Newburn added: 'Few other industries of this size and impact go
unregulated.'

FT  18 AUG 94 / More pass A-levels in spite of smaller entry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of school pupils passing GCE A-level examinations in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland reached a record this year in spite of a 4 per
cent reduction in the number of 18-year-olds, the government announced
today.
But falling applications for science subjects accentuated concern raised
this week by a government inspectors' report which found that in England and
Wales 'not all science and mathematics teachers have the skills and talents
required to do their job'.
The numbers taking physics at A-level fell 5.8 per cent following a fall of
9.6 per cent last year. Chemistry entries rose by 0.6 per cent, but this
still left numbers short of their 1992 levels following a 4.5 per cent fall
last year.
Instead, there was an increase of 15.5 per cent in the 'all other subjects'
category, which includes film, theatre, and media studies.
Economics suffered the single greatest fall in applications, of 15.2 per
cent, following 10 per cent last year, as students seem instead to be
increasingly attracted to business studies, up 9.9 per cent.
While the numbers attempting the exams fell only 0.4 per cent compared with
last year's record high entry, pass rates improved significantly, meaning
that there were more passes.
The proportion passing with at least a grade C - usually the level required
by universities - rose 2.2 percentage points, while the share of candidates
managing at least a pass grade E rose 1.8 percentage points.
Mr Eric Forth, the schools minister, welcomed the result and made a strong
defence of the qualification, in spite of calls for its abolition by the
Labour party.
He said: 'Today's results prove that GCE A-levels remain popular and are
more successful than ever before. They are a world-renowned trademark of
Britain's educational excellence.'
He said the government remained committed to the exams, which would continue
to be offered alongside general national vocational qualification (GNVQs).
He predicted that more students would 'mix and match' A-level and vocational
qualifications.
Ms Kathleen Tattersall, chief executive of the Northern Examinations and
Assessment Board who speaks for the GCE boards, said the better results had
been driven by 'increased competition for university places and jobs,
combined with improvements in the preparation and presentation of students
for examinations'.
But teachers gave the figures a more cautious welcome. Ms Gillian Wood,
assistant general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers,
said: 'The number of young people who leave school or college with a
qualification at 18 is still far too low.
'We not only need to maintain the quality of A-levels but also to widen the
range of opportunities for youngsters to encourage them to stay on at school
or college.'

FT  18 AUG 94 / Lloyd's looks at liability reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's is considering a scheme which would make it easier for all its
individual Names to trade on a limited liability basis.
The plan, outlined in the latest issue of World Insurance Report, a
Financial Times newsletter, would allow Names to form individually owned
insurance companies. It has been devised by Citibank in collaboration with a
group of members' agents, and by Neville Russell, a firm of chartered
accountants.
It is part of a series of measures designed to shore up the market's capital
base in the wake of some Pounds 7bn of losses in recent years.
Under the scheme, Names could transfer existing liabilities underwritten on
an unlimited liability basis into the new vehicles and continue underwriting
new business on a limited liability basis, possibly from the beginning of
1995.
Last year the market successfully attracted more than Pounds 800m in
corporate capital, allowing new institutional investors, insurance companies
and individuals to trade at Lloyd's with limited liability.
At present however, existing individual Names would have to resign and then
rejoin the market if they wished to limit their liabilities. In addition
corporate members must deposit a minimum of Pounds 1.5m with Lloyd's, much
more than is typically required from Names with unlimited liability.
The new companies would be managed by the agents who handle the affairs of
Names and would be capitalised with money drawn from the funds deposited by
Names with Lloyd's. The proposals are unlikely to offer much help for Names
unable to pay past losses.
According to World Insurance Report the scheme originally envisaged that the
new vehicles would be established in Bermuda, where the reinsurance industry
has grown rapidly in recent years.
However legal advisers are understood to have found a cheap means to
register the companies in the UK. It is unclear how much capital the new
companies will need and how much business they will be allowed to
underwrite.
Lloyd's, which has been hard hit by losses from catastrophes and US legal
awards, announced losses of Pounds 2bn when reporting its 1991 results in
May, in line with its three-year accounting system.
Separately, the market is continuing work on proposals which could allow
Names to sell or transfer their participations at the market. Lloyd's
announced details in May following a report by the Value Group, a team of
market professionals.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Gallery chief apologises over Getty comments
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Timothy Clifford, director of the National Galleries of Scotland,
yesterday apologised publicly for upsetting Mr John Paul Getty II after the
American billionaire philanthropist threatened to withdraw his Pounds 1m
pledge to help keep the 'The Three Graces' sculpture in the UK.
In a letter leaked to The Times and published yesterday, Mr Getty said he
was 'astonished' at Mr Clifford's claim last week that Mr Getty's
relationship with his late father may have been a factor in his offer to the
fund to stop the statue being sold to the Getty Museum in California.
Mr Getty said the claim was 'untrue and very embarrassing' to himself and
the Getty Museum, and he threatened to withdraw the offer.
The appeal, by the National Galleries of Scotland and the Victoria and
Albert Museum in London, aims to raise Pounds 7.6m to match the offer from
the Getty Museum. Mr Getty's offer of Pounds 1m had left the appeal Pounds
800,000 short of the target.
After a visit yesterday to the Department of National Heritage, Mr Clifford
said he made his assertion in response to a leading question for which he
was unprepared.
He said: 'As soon as I said this I regretted the statement.
'With hindsight I realised that I should have utterly rejected the
suggestion to the television interviewer as I know nothing about Mr Getty's
relationship with his father.'
Mr George Levy, a trustee of the London Houses Museum Trust, said: 'It would
be tragic if this slight misunderstanding between Mr Clifford and Mr Getty
were in any way to prevent 'The Three Graces' staying in Britain.'
Mr Getty was not available for comment.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Brussels may probe travel groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Independent tour operators and travel agents are to ask the European
Commission to investigate the dominant position of large travel groups.
The decision to approach the Commission follows last week's announcement by
the Office of Fair Trading that it had cleared the large travel groups of
anti-competitive practices. The submission to the Commission will be made by
the Association of Independent Tour Operators and the Alliance of
Independent Travel Agents.
Mr Colin Heal, chairman of the alliance, said the position of small travel
companies had worsened since the OFT began its inquiry 14 months ago.
Airtours, the second largest tour operator, had, by acquiring other travel
agents, developed Going Places, the second-largest retail chain.
The three largest travel agents' chains also launched a price-cutting
campaign earlier this month, offering discounts of up to 15 per cent.
Smaller travel agents say they find it difficult to match these offers as
the standard rate of commission is only 10 per cent.
Mr Heal said his organisation had approached competition policy officials at
the Commission several weeks ago, before the OFT announcement.
Meanwhile, the large travel agents yesterday began to reduce the level of
discounts on offer. Thomas Cook said it had decided to reduce its top
discount on summer 1995 holidays to 12 per cent. The chain, the
third-largest, had for two weeks been offering discounts of up to 15 per
cent. Going Places said it had also reduced its top discount to 12 per cent.
Lunn Poly, the largest travel retail chain, said it would make an
announcement today.
Mr Peter Shanks, Thomas Cook's commercial director, said: 'The 15 per cent
discounts were never going to be sustainable . . . For travel agents it just
did not make commercial sense.'
The 15 per cent discounts appear to have achieved their objective of
persuading holidaymakers to book early. About 500,000 holidays for summer
1995 have been sold so far.
Airtours, which issued its summer 1995 brochures first, is believed to have
made a good start against Thomson, the largest tour operator.
Owners Abroad, which this week said it was changing its name to First
Choice, is believed to have lost market share through its failure to publish
its brochures at the same time as its rivals.

FT  18 AUG 94 / OFT plan to reduce credit card protection attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Credit card holders could lose out under the reforms of consumer credit
proposed by the Office of Fair Trading, the Consumers' Association warns in
a report published today.
The association attacked the new limits recommended by the OFT within which
card issuers should be liable for goods or services misrepresented or not
delivered. It released a poll showing that customers value the protection.
The survey, by opinion pollsters BRMB, found that seven out of 10 of those
with credit cards knew that using a card provided some protection if goods
bought proved faulty.
Once it had been explained to those who had been unaware of it, almost
two-thirds of the total rated the protection as very or fairly important.
The removal of credit providers' joint and several liability was one of the
recommendations from the deregulation taskforces set up by the Department of
Trade and Industry.
In June the OFT concluded that the protection should remain, but within
slightly narrower limits. It said the minimum transaction for which it would
apply should be raised from Pounds 100 to Pounds 150, while the upper limit
should be set at Pounds 25,000 rather than Pounds 30,000.
Ms Jean Eaglesham, the association's head of money policy, said it was
'iniquitous to raise the lower limit while lowering the upper limit',
particularly as the average credit card purchase was just Pounds 40.
The OFT said the rise in the lower limit, the first since 1985, would be in
line with keeping the liability to relatively high-priced goods and
services. It did not believe significant transactions currently protected in
law would be excluded by the fall in the maximum.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Private-sector road project launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four road building schemes worth a total of Pounds 380m are to be offered to
private contractors under a government initiative to involve private-sector
expertise in the management of roads.
Mr John Watts, roads minister, yesterday announced the details of the roads
to be included in the first stage of the government's 'design, build,
finance and operate' programme.
Contractors will be expected to design new roads or improvements to existing
ones, finance their construction and manage and maintain the roads for the
next 15 to 25 years.
They will be paid 'shadow tolls' by the government which will reflect
traffic volumes on the roads and the extent to which they meet set
performance standards.
The four schemes announced yesterday are:
A Pounds 190m project to build a 19-mile link joining the M1 and M62 south
of Leeds with the A1. All three existing roads will be widened to dual
four-lane capacity on their approaches to the new link road.
A Pounds 145m scheme to widen 13 miles of the A1 to motorway standard
between Alconbury and Peterborough.
A Pounds 35m scheme that will see the widening of a 34-mile stretch of the
A419 and A417 between Swindon and Gloucester, including two local by-passes.
A Pounds 10m project to by-pass Haltwhistle on the A69 plus the management
of the entire 53-mile length of the A69 between Newcastle upon Tyne and
Carlisle.
Mr Watts said involving the private sector would allow the Department of
Transport to speed up its roads programme and provide better value for money
during the life of management concession.
He added: 'There is a great deal of enthusiasm in the City and industry for
these schemes.'
Contractors must register an interest by September 30. Tenders will be
invited in November and work on the first scheme is expected to start by the
summer of 1995.
Due to the novelty of this sort of contract the government has yet to decide
on the terms and conditions. It will publish an illustrative draft contract
to get negotiations started.
Trafalgar House, a big contractor, said it expected to bid, although it
would probably act with a partner or partners. A 15-year concession was the
minimum period which would be attractive for it to be involved, it said.
Balfour Beatty, another construction company, said it hoped that the
government would give the maximum freedom to contractors to manage the
roads. Involvement would help the company expand its roads activities
internationally.

Universities yesterday predicted a 'massive denial of opportunity' to
school-leavers unless the government drops its policy of keeping the numbers
entering higher education at the same level for the next three years.
This year's A-level results, published today, suggest that the number of
18-year-olds achieving grades worthy of entrance to university this year was
only marginally up on last year.
However, the Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals said that the
government had been 'saved' by a demographic dip of 4 per cent in the number
of children of school-leaving age. A spokesman said: 'Once the demographic
downturn turns into an upturn, as it will do shortly, that is going to mean
an absolute increase in the number of people reaching university standard.
At that point, the cap on admissions must come off.'
Mr Bryan Davies, Labour's higher education spokesman, said 'many thousands
more students' could have attended university if the government had allowed
expansion to continue as in previous years.
He added that tight government targets would mean that mature students would
'join the tail end of the queue' for university admission, while the
increased reliance on the university clearing system this year would be
'chaotic', leading to more drop-outs.
He said: 'The admissions system will need to be changed. It has become
archaic.'
Mr John Akker, general secretary of the Natfhe lecturers' union, said the
present arrangements allowed 'neither individuals nor institutions to plan
properly for their futures'.
Mr Eric Forth, the schools minister, said that admissions were the
responsibility of universities, and of the Universities and Colleges
Admissions Service, and he looked to them to ensure a 'smooth and orderly
start for all students'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Train travellers are getting a 'deplorable and atrocious' service from
British Rail's telephone inquiry bureaux, the Central Rail Users'
Consultative Committee said yesterday.
Some of the bureaux have come up with 'dreadful levels of accuracy' in the
information given out, the passenger watchdog body said.
BR acknowledged that the services were 'not meeting standards' and said
talks were due to be held with the train-operating companies about improving
performance.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Reform of sixth-form curriculum slows
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's most concerted attempt to broaden the sixth-form curriculum
appears to be grinding to a halt, according to today's figures.
Advanced Supplementary, or AS-levels were introduced six years ago. Each
AS-level is worth half an A-level for university entrance purposes. The
exams were designed to be as intellectually rigorous as A-levels, but
requiring only half as much preparation.
However, schools complain that the exams create timetabling difficulties,
and that many should be worth more than half an A-level. The numbers taking
AS-levels fell slightly this year, with slightly more than 53,000
applications - compared to around 750,000 applications for full A-levels.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Row over job at Yorkshire Water
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A leading corporate governance consultancy is advising its clients, who have
more than Pounds 20bn under management, to support the controversial
election of a former industry regulator to the board of Yorkshire Water.
The nomination of Mrs Diana Scott, until recently head of Yorkshire Water
Services Committee - a customer committee part of water regulator Ofwat -
has been opposed by Yorkshire's directors.
Mrs Scott's nomination coincided with her expressing concerns over price
rises and the quality of customer service being provided by the company.
The decision of Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of Ofwat, not to reappoint
Mrs Scott as head of the Yorkshire customer committee came after she
criticised water company plans to extend household metering.
PIRC, the consultancy which advises leading local authority and several
private pension fund investors, says: 'The issues which Mrs Scott has raised
have serious implications for the company's relations with customers, the
regulators and the community, and thus ultimately on shareholder value.'
According to PIRC, Mrs Scott suggests that 'deficiencies in the management
of Yorkshire Water have resulted in above-average levels of complaints'.
In a circular to shareholders, Yorkshire Water said: 'The directors do not
consider that Mrs Scott has the business experience necessary for the
corporate governance or strategic direction of such a company or group.'

FT  18 AUG 94 / Summer sales push down RPI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Heavy discounting in the summer sales led to record price falls for
household goods, clothing and footwear, the Central Statistical Office said
yesterday.
The retail prices index fell to 144.0 last month, down 0.5 per cent from
June, with January 1987 taken as 100. This surprised City analysts, who had
predicted a 0.2 per cent fall during the month.
Measured on a yearly basis underlying retail price inflation - which
excludes mortgage interest payments - was running at 2.2 per cent in July,
compared with the previous July, down from 2.4 per cent in June.
The CSO said a significant reason for the fall was heavy high street
discounting, which affected most consumer goods and may have been
particularly exaggerated in the statistics by the timing of the summer
sales. Although the sharpest annual price decreases in last year's summer
sales occurred in June, this year the sharpest decreases were in July. Thus
although the price fall in July was bigger than that last July, adding June
and July together showed that the scale of the price fall for the two months
this year was the same as in June and July last year.
City analysts yesterday pointed out that the fact that the price falls were
spread across a number of sectors suggested that inflation pressures
remained very subdued.
Mr Ian Shepherdson of Midland Global markets said that 'all of the good
news' in the figures was in the core rate. ' 'Funnies' are not the cause of
the drop in inflation,' he added.
Household goods fell 1.7 per cent month-on-month, largely due to sharp
reductions in most furniture, furnishing and electrical appliances. The CSO
said this was the biggest monthly July reduction since statistically
equivalent records started in 1956. Compared with last July, the price of
household goods was 0.2 per cent lower.
Clothing saw the steepest July fall since the series started in 1914. The
clothing and footwear index fell 4.2 per cent compared with June.
Leisure goods also saw the largest monthly fall since its series started in
1987. The CSO said a reason for this fall was monthly reductions in
audio-visual equipment, tapes, discs, toys and sports goods.
The price cuts by the Telegraph and Times newspapers accounted for about a
quarter of the overall monthly price change in the leisure goods series.
In the motoring sector prices fell 0.3 per cent in July, compared with June.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Wage rise rate eases fears on inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The underlying rate of annual increase in average earnings was unchanged at
3.75 per cent in May, easing fears that rising wages would add to
inflationary pres-sures.
Average earnings growth started to increase late last year, with the
underlying rate rising from 3 per cent in November to 4 per cent in March
this year.
But the annual rate fell to 3.75 per cent in April, where it has remained
for three months.
The Department of Employment said the main settlements announced in June
were for agricultural workers, who received a 4.9 per cent rise, building
and civil engineering workers at 2.4 per cent and British Rail drivers with
2.5 per cent.
In the production and services sectors the annual rates of underlying
average earnings growth were unchanged in June, at 4.25 per cent and 3.5 per
cent respectively. In manufacturing the annual rate fell to 4.25 per cent,
from a revised 4.5 per cent in May.
Overall, the annual seasonally adjusted rate of earnings growth, which
unlike the underlying rate does not exclude temporary factors such as the
irregular timing of payments, fell to 3.6 per cent in June from 4.6 per cent
in May.
Mr Don Smith, UK economist at Midland Global Markets, said: 'These figures
are very encouraging and bear out our expectation that, unless pay
settlements move up very sharply, and they show no sign of doing so, then
underlying average earnings growth should remain at, or below, 4 per cent.'
He added: 'There is absolutely nothing in these figures for the authorities
to be worried about.'
The Department of Employment said growth in unit labour costs - wages and
salaries per unit of output - had slowed sharply. In the three months to
June unit costs were just 0.1 per cent higher than in the same period last
year, down from 1.3 per cent in the three months to May.
Many analysts said they were pleased with the labour cost figures. Mr Adam
Cole, UK economist at James Capel, said: 'Sharp falls in manufacturing unit
labour costs - by far the largest component of manufacturers' overall cost
bill - should more than offset the impact of rising commodity prices.'

FT  18 AUG 94 / Decline in unemployment continues to slow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 11,800 fall in seasonally adjusted unemployment in July - the smallest
decrease in six months - may indicate that the rate of decline is slowing.
Although the fall in July was the sixth successive monthly decline,
according to the Department of Employment, the size of the change has been
steadily dwindling since April's fall of 37,800. City analysts had expected
an 18,000 fall in July.
The seasonally adjusted unemployment total is 2.632m - 9.3 per cent of the
workforce. Unadjusted, the total rose 57,531 to 2.643m. Unadjusted
unemployment normally rises in the summer as young people leave education
and join the workforce.
The employment data also show that the number of long-term unemployed is at
last starting to decline. The number of those out of work for more than a
year fell 41,300 between April and July to reach 1.004m, the lowest since
October 1992. Those out of work for more than six months fell 91,300 to
1.511m.
Early results from the government's spring Labour Force Survey - which
covers the period from March to May - were released yesterday. The survey
found that employment rose 80,000 between the winter and the spring, with
male employment rising 58,000 and female employment 22,000.
The increase in employment was more than accounted for by part-time jobs
which rose 86,000. Full-time employment fell 8,000.
Using the International Labour Office definition of unemployment, an
internationally accepted standard, the survey found that the jobless total
fell 79,000 between winter and spring. Unemployment on this definition was
61,000 higher than the average official claimant count over the same period.
The number of unfilled vacancies at Jobcentres rose 4,000 in July, on a
seasonally adjusted basis, to reach 157,000, the highest since September
1990. The number of new vacancies notified to Jobcentres fell slightly to
206,100 last month, from 209,700 in June.
Unemployment fell in all regions in July, except Scotland and the north of
England. Male unemployment fell in every region apart from Scotland while
female unemployment rose in every region except East Anglia and the
south-west.
Overall, 12.6 per cent of males and 5.1 per cent of females are unemployed
and claiming benefit. There was a fall between April and July in
unemployment across all age groups, except those aged between 20 and 24.
The number of manufacturing employees fell 9,000 in June to 4.229m. Over the
year to June employment in manufacturing fell 41,000. The Department of
Employment pointed out that there had been only four annual rises in
manufacturing employment in the past 23 years.
Overtime hours worked in manufacturing jumped from a revised 8.65m in May to
9.39m in June. Hours lost through short-time working fell slightly from a
revised 0.25m to 0.24m in the same period.
Output per head, the measure of productivity in manufacturing, was 4.3 per
cent higher in the three months to June than in the same period last year.
The effect of the signal workers' strike pushed up the number of working
days lost through industrial stoppages to 70,000 in June from 31,000 in May.
Nevertheless, the 170 stoppages in the 12 months to June were the lowest
figure recorded since 1920.
Regional percentage unemployment figures in July were: south-east 9.1;
Greater London 10.7; East Anglia 7.2; south-west 8.4; west Midlands 9.5;
east Midlands 8.8; Yorks/Humberside 9.5; north-west 9.7; north 11.3; Wales
9.6; Scotland 9.3.

FT  18 AUG 94 / NVQs criticised as 'too narrow' for trainees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's new occupational training system is not giving trainees the
basic skills for their working lives, the National Institute of Economic and
Social Research said yesterday.
It said the national vocational qualifications system was 'not a sensible
use of public funding'.
The institute criticised the system as too narrow, focusing on competences
in particular tasks, and argued that government money would be better spent
on 'the development of general, transferable skills in an educational
environment'.
It also suggested that NVQs were 'inappropriate' for unemployed
school-leavers and questioned the independence of their assessment.
In a report in its latest quarterly review, published yesterday, the
institute says unqualified, unskilled young people with about 40 years of
working life ahead of them 'are being trained in a set of narrow competences
which will not easily permit either the flexibility or career dev-elopment
in later years which the economy and technical progress increasingly
demand'.
The report follows similar criticisms of the NVQ system last year by
Professor Alan Smithers of the University of Manchester, who advises the
Department for Education on further education.
He said NVQs were 'a disaster of epic proportions' because they were not
independently assessed, and trainees were not given necessary theoretical
grounding to accompany skills.
The study focuses on the impact of NVQs, introduced in 1990, on youth
training for the building trades. It is highly critical of NVQ Level 2,
which has replaced City and Guild certificates.
It says the standards have 'led to a significant reduction in the amount of
mathematics taught to young building trainees' compared with the old City
and Guild standards and those required by young people on similar courses in
France and Germany.
It says NVQs in mathematics for bricklaying do not examine conversion of one
metric measurement to another, fractions and percentages of quantities and
calculating the volumes of solid shapes.
These elements were all included in the City and Guilds certificates.
The report points out that the NVQ's competence-based assessment 'requires
the candidate to pass in every element of the assessment'.
It suggests that 'low levels of numeracy among large parts of the workforce
has led to minimal levels of mathematics being required for NVQ
certification at Level 2 in order to ensure that the qualification is within
reach of the average adult employee'.
It says that as a result those requirements are 'unsuitable for young
trainees who need to consolidate and build at mathematics acquired at school
as preparation for further progression and for maximum adaptability to a
fast changing labour market'.
The report adds: 'The linking of Youth Training funding to outcomes of NVQ
assessment without proper guarantees of independence for college-based
assessors has resulted in damaging press-ures on colleges to deny entry to
poorly qualified trainees and to pass students who are only barely
competent.'

FT  18 AUG 94 / Growth to exceed Treasury forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Economic growth this year and next will be stronger than the Treasury
expects, but inflation will rise to the top of the government's target range
of between 1 per cent and 4 per cent, the National Institute of Economic and
Social Research says, Philip Coggan writes.
The institute predicts that gross domestic product will rise 3.1 per cent
this year and 2.9 per cent in 1995, compared with Treasury forecasts of 2.75
per cent for both years.
It believes that inflation will 'begin to rise a little by the end of the
year, helped by higher demand pressures and input costs'. It forecasts that
underlying inflation - excluding mortgage interest payments - will increase
to 2.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of this year and to 3.8 per cent by
the end of 1995. Headline inflation will reach 4.5 per cent at the end of
next year, the institute says.
The Treasury is predicting underlying inflation of 2.5 per cent in the
fourth quarter of this year, rising to 2.75 per cent in the fourth quarter
of 1995.
The institute says that 'one reason for the lack of credibility of the
stated aim for inflation is uncertainty as to who is really in charge of
monetary policy'. It adds: 'As interest rates rise, it would be good to see
the government making it unambiguously clear that the responsibility for
raising them belongs to the government itself.'
One risk to the forecast is that credit demand might expand more than
predicted in the latter half of the decade. The institute says that if this
expansion occurs, with base rates unchanged, output and inflation will grow
rapidly until inflation peaks at just less than 6 per cent. Alternatively
short-term rates could respond, climbing to 10.5 per cent by 1997.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Shoppers pick up the windfalls: A look at a nectarine glut,
an onion drought and a tomato shortage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As statisticians mull over the detail of the latest retail prices index the
meat eaters among them are likely to be smiling while the vegetarians may
have cause to sigh.
In a month when food accounted for almost a fifth of the overall fall in
inflation the movement of prices in the UK grocery basket is proving
distinctly volatile.
On the one hand the cost of non-seasonal foods has been falling steadily in
recent months, largely due to cost-cutting in beef, pork, soft drinks and
processed foods. Non-seasonal foods were 0.7 per cent cheaper in July
compared with the previous July - their biggest annual decrease for more
than 30 years.
On the other hand the price of seasonal foods has remained relatively high.
Although seasonal foods fell 2.5 per cent in June compared with July, this
fall was smaller than normal and prices are running about 9.2 per cent
higher than last year.
The reason for these sharply divergent statistics lies partly in
retail-sector price competition - and partly in a recent spate of global
weather disasters which have left some of the fresh fruit and vegetable
market suffering.
The apple market has been badly affected by hailstorms in New Zealand. The
Central Statistical Office said yesterday that this had pushed up prices
sharply. Chile used to provide an alternative source of apples, but European
tariffs have encouraged Chilean apple producers to move to US markets,
leaving South African suppliers with a dominant position in the UK apple
market.
Onions have been another victim of the weather. Droughts in Spain have
reduced the UK's usual onion supply, so the UK is now importing its onions
from Australia - at extra cost.
The tomato market was also unusually tight last month. Mr John McGinty, CSO
statistician, said: 'The hot weather pushed the demand for tomatoes up, but
the main UK crop has not yet arrived, so prices have risen.'
Potato prices are 26 per cent higher than last year, partly because dry
weather this year has persuaded farmers that there will be little crop
surplus.
Nectarines, by contrast, have fallen in price, amid a European-wide glut.
The main reason for this is a new European Union regulation restricting the
Italian distilleries from using the fruit in spirits.
The CSO said yesterday that although these factors had contributed to the
volatility of the food price index, the main factor subduing overall food
costs, particularly for non-seasonal food, remained continued price wars
among UK retailers. In recent months there have been a series of discounts
and promotions in key sectors, such as bread, biscuits and processed foods.
Bread and cereal prices were 3 per cent lower last month than last July.
The prices of all types of meat have fallen significantly, partly because of
a recent rise in the slaughter rate, the CSO said.
Pork is 7 per cent cheaper than a year ago and bacon has fallen 3 per cent.
Although CSO statisticians admit that the price of beef has been 'all over
the place' in recent months due to the scares about BSE - or mad cow disease
 -beef prices are still running 5 per cent below their levels last year.
Economists believe that in the short term, at least, this intense price
pressure is likely to keep food prices down in coming months. But the
weather could yet give the analysts more food for thought in some sectors.
The CSO is already predicting a rise in the price of baked beans next month
 -due to a recent spate of flash floods in America.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Property developer jailed for fraud
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A property developer who cheated building societies out of almost Pounds 2m
to achieve his boyhood dream of owning a set of commercial buildings in his
home town of Basingstoke was jailed for two years yesterday.
Mr Montague Alexander, 50, built up The Warren complex, Winchester Crown
Court heard. He ran up large debts, however, and tricked building societies
into handing over money.
Mr Alexander admitted eight offences of obtaining money by deception from
four building societies. He asked for 18 similar offences to be considered.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Cut in credit card protection attacked
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Credit card holders could lose out under the reforms of consumer credit
proposed by the Office of Fair Trading, the Consumers' Association warns in
a report published today.
The association attacked the new limits recommended by the OFT within which
card issuers should be liable for goods or services misrepresented or not
delivered. In June the OFT concluded that the protection should remain, but
in slightly narrower limits. It said the minimum transaction for which it
would apply should be raised from Pounds 100 to Pounds 150, while the upper
limit should be set at Pounds 25,000 rather than Pounds 30,000.
Ms Jean Eaglesham, the association's head of money policy, said it was
'iniquitous to raise the lower limit while lowering the upper limit',
particularly as the average credit card purchase was just Pounds 40.
The OFT said the rise in the lower limit, the first since 1985, would be in
line with keeping the liability to relatively high-priced goods and
services.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Record company case goes to US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Phonogram UK, the record distributor, yesterday switched from the UK to US
courts its legal dispute with American Recordings over the distribution of
albums by artists including Johnny Cash, John Mason writes.
Phonogram, a subsidiary of PolyGram, the music and film group, had been
seeking a High Court injunction to block American Recordings from dealing
with other distributors for its sales of its artist's records outside the
US.
It claims that American has violated a joint venture agreement in which
Phonogram was named as sole distributor for American's artists outside the
US. At the start of yesterday's hearing the company said that it was
dropping its British action and launching a multi-million dollar claim for
punitive damages in the US.
The action in the US also seeks to restrain American from entering into a
distribution agreement with any other company until the dispute is resolved.
The action is a counter-suit to a Dollars 14m (Pounds 9m) action already
brought against Phonogram by American in the Los Angeles Superior Court.
The US label has said that Phonogram did not abide by the terms of the joint
venture agreement.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Timothy Clifford, director of the National Galleries of Scotland,
yesterday apologised publicly for upsetting Mr John Paul Getty II after the
billionaire philanthropist threatened to withdraw his Pounds 1m pledge to
help keep Canova's 'The Three Graces' sculpture in the UK.
Mr Clifford apologised to Mr Getty 'for any distress I caused him' in
claiming that the philanthropist's relationship with his late father may
have been a factor in the offer to stop the statue being sold to the Getty
Museum in California. He hoped his mistake would 'not damage the cause of
the appeal'.
In a letter leaked to The Times and published yesterday, Mr Getty said he
was 'astonished' at Mr Clifford's claim last week which was 'untrue and very
embarrassing' to himself and the Getty Museum.
The appeal aims to raise Pounds 7.6m to match the offer from the Getty
Museum.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Support trickles back for Clinton crime bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton's crime bill could be heading back to the floor of
the House of Representatives for another vote tomorrow, as a trickle of
waverers started to move over to the president's side.
Since the bill was blocked last week on a 225-210 procedural vote, Mr
Clinton has hammered away at the Republicans who provided most of the
opposition, while at the same time offering concessions to persuade some
members to change their votes.
A successful vote on the crime bill would restore some momentum to the
president's stalled legislative programme. He is still making grindingly
slow progress in the House on his principal objective, healthcare reform.
But this at last began to move forward in the Senate on Tuesday, when the
first amendment to the Democratic leadership's bill, to speed up the
provision of prenatal care, passed by a vote of 55-42.
Mr Clinton needs only eight House members to change their votes in order to
bring the crime bill back to the floor. Some black members now say they are
willing to switch in exchange for Mr Clinton's promise to work on the uneven
application of the death penalty to black and white defendants.
And some Republicans who favour gun control but voted against the bill last
week are now ready to vote for it, provided some face-saving changes can be
negotiated to give them a justification for switching.
White House officials said four points were not negotiable: funding for
100,000 new police officers, a ban on assault guns, the 'three strikes and
out' rule of life imprisonment for a third violent crime, and significant
funding for crime prevention programmes.
Despite a readiness to make compromises, senior administration officials
continued to attack the Republicans.
'The issue, very simply, is whether or not enough members of Congress are
going to have the courage to vote against the National Rifle Association,
which has put on a full court press to try to defeat this ban on assault
weapons,' Vice President Al Gore said yesterday.
In political terms, the argument has turned into a game of chicken. Neither
Republicans nor Democrats are absolutely sure which side will pay the
greater price with voters in the November congressional elections if
anti-crime legislation, which is generally popular, fails to pass.
Immediate polls show Mr Clinton's stock falling in the wake of last week's
defeat on the bill. Many political analysts believe the Democrats will
suffer most because they will be seen as incapable of getting anything done,
despite controlling the White House and both houses of Congress.
But in some districts Republicans are catching flak from mayors, police
chiefs and constituents for blocking the bill.

FT  18 AUG 94 / US warns over UN role in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US expects the British and French governments to come under increasing
domestic pressure to withdraw their peacekeeping troops from Bosnia, if the
embargo on supplying arms to Bosnia is lifted this year.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Warren Christopher, US
secretary of state, made clear that removing the embargo had long been the
logical consequence of failure to reach a peace agreement. 'It will be time
to ring up the sums,' he said. He implied that this would include
questioning the viability of the UN peacekeeping presence in Bosnia, if
fighting were to escalate with a resupplying of the Bosnian army.
The thrust of his comments on Bosnia suggests that the US will no longer be
sympathetic to the case most forcefully expressed in the past by the UK
government - that maintaining the UN peacekeeping presence was essential to
humanitarian operations.
However, western diplomats in Washington noted that the UK government has
also said that anything that changes the impartial role played by the 3,500
British troops could lead to withdrawal. France might be more ready to pull
out its roughly 4,000-strong contingent but the UK had been 'prepared to do
another winter' unless there were multilateral agreement to withdraw the
peacekeeping force.
The US administration's Bosnia policy is now constrained by a deal done with
the Senate last week. This gives the Bosnian Serbs until October 15 to sign
the territorial agreement proposed by the five-nation 'contact group',
failing which Mr Clinton is committed to ask the UN Security Council to
approve a multilateral end to the embargo by October 31.
If that proves unsuccessful, an amendment sponsored by Senator Robert Dole,
the Republican leader, requires the president to lift the embargo
unilaterally by November 15. This buys the administration time but imposes
deadlines which Mr Clinton may not easily escape, given congressional
sentiment.
Mr Christopher emphasised the value of the co-operation achieved this year
on Bosnia by the US, Britain, France and Russia. He and the president prefer
a multilateral lifting of the embargo so as to preserve solidarity and not
to have called into question UN embargoes on Iraq, Libya and Haiti.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Christopher comfortable in a job he's sticking with: Jurek
Martin talks to a much maligned US secretary of state with some foreign
policy victories to show off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Suddenly, Mr Warren Christopher does not look or sound like a man who is
winding down his portfolio. Maybe it is progress in the Middle East or
fruitful relations with Russia, or perhaps it is the more mundane prospect
of two weeks off in California starting this weekend.
But, with the Clinton administration under so much fire on so many fronts,
the much maligned US secretary of state seems relatively perky these days. A
one-on-one interview, part of a small series with the media, was designed to
show a man in command of his brief and not about to leave it.
He had already this week earned the high praise, on the Middle East if not
Bosnia, of a frequently severe critic, Mr Anthony Lewis, the New York Times
columnist, who also had been given an extensive interview.
Mr Christopher was ready for the one question that had to be asked about his
security in office. 'The president and I are working on a number of problems
with a very long time line ahead. Under his direction and with his strong
support, I expect to be working on them for some time . . . (pause and small
smile) . . . with the grace of God.' He goes on: 'Preoccupation with my
future is one I don't share.'
The second message was directed at Europe - and perhaps (though never
mentioned by name) Dr Henry Kissinger, who just that morning had unleashed
one of his regular broadsides accusing the administration of neglecting the
Atlantic alliance because of its over-emphasis on Russia.
The word is that Europe matters, as witnessed by three presidential trips
this year and many more by Mr Christopher himself. 'The irony is I've spent
more time on European security than on the Middle East,' which is widely
considered to be the leitmotif of his tenure.
Towards the end of last year, he says, the US was looking at a 'sulphurous'
trade conflict with western Europe.
But the Gatt agreement 'lifted the cloud' and contributed, along with a lot
of leadership from Mr Manfred Worner, the late Nato secretary general, to
the improved climate that brought about Nato's Partnership for Peace
programme of co-operation with the former Warsaw Pact nations. (Mr
Christopher is delivering a eulogy at the memorial service for Mr Worner
tomorrow.)
The search for 'new or renewed architecture' had been a constant imperative.
Mr Christopher sees nothing wrong in the Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), which Dr Kissinger commended as the best
vehicle for working with Moscow.
But he maintains that building mutual confidence between Nato and the former
Warsaw Pact ought to be based on the practical experience that PFP was
intended to foster. In any case, the direct Washington-Moscow channel had
worked well enough in attempting to resolve the status of Russians still in
the Baltics.
'Never forget, too, that it was the Europeans who came to us in January' for
help on Bosnia, he says. The Bosnian 'contact group' had done much good
work. 'It was worth taking time to keep the Russians on board,' while, with
Britain and France 'we can't turn away from our longstanding friends.' It
took time, also, to establish 'the Moslem bottom line'.
Yet he does not deny the possibility of another crunch with the allies if Mr
Clinton follows the will of Congress and ends, unilaterally if necessary,
the arms embargo on Bosnia early in November, assuming the Bosnian Serbs
have not by then signed up to the peace plan.
'No one is ready to give up on the possible acceptance of the contact group
plan,' he insists, but adds that it would be unwise to pin too many hopes on
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia delivering the signature of the
Bosnian Serbs.
'He will take some steps, but not too many,' partly because of the sort of
pressure from his ultra-nationalists that led him to reject the posting of
UN monitors on the border with the Bosnian Serbs.
In that event, 'it will be time to ring up the sums'. It had always been
clear, he says, that 'there might come a day when the time would come to
lift the embargo.' Even the Russians, he implies, understand this.
If that renders the presence of Unprofor in Bosnia untenable, then, in
effect, so be it. Mr Christopher suggests that such a decision might in any
case 'coincide' with domestic pressure in Britain and France for a
withdrawal of their Unprofor contingents.
The secretary of state is not given to sweeping visions or grand strategic
concepts, which frustrates his critics. Even when addressing human tragedies
such as Bosnia and Rwanda, he still speaks like the lawyer he is.
Thus Bosnia, he repeats, is 'an important - but not vital - interest to the
US'. Rwanda and Burundi could be placed in the same category, though Haiti,
as a potential hemispheric source of instability, is of a different order.
With some hope, he says, 'we could well be working out an approach more akin
to case law than the enunciation of great principles'. He takes
encouragement from the fact that the proposed Bosnian war crimes tribunal
has already indicated its willingness to extend its jurisdiction to Rwanda.
Somalia, he goes on, 'showed us what we can do (bring relief) and what we
can't do (nation-building)'. Preventative diplomacy is always worth a try -
and is now being applied by the US in Burundi, with envoys stressing the
'lessons of integration'. Similarly, the US is urging the Algerian
government 'to press for a dialogue with Islamic groups committed to a
non-violent future'.
But in a democratic society such as the US, 'we don't have an inexhaustible
supply of support or patience' for efforts to solve distant and intractable
problems.
In Africa, especially, it does not help that regional engagement is so weak,
with Nigeria, the 'former backbone of the OAU (Organisation of African
Unity)' in 'such a dangerous situation', and with the new South Africa
probably ill-advised 'to spread its resources too thinly' elsewhere in the
continent.
Even closer to home, he remains quintessentially cautious. Asked if there
was not now an opening to engage Cuba's President Fidel Castro he merely
acknowledges domestic political constraints, though hopes there may be
'signs of movement' among Cuban Americans committed to the overthrow of the
Havana regime.
But in the hierarchy of US responses nothing can compare with attacks on the
US itself, its citizens and its allies, none of which, he notes with some
pride, has 'really happened' (except arguably in Somalia) since he has been
on the job.
In the second tier come issues related to nuclear non-proliferation, be it
the threat posed by North Korea or the dismantling of former Soviet missiles
stationed in Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan. 'I don't believe we've been
given enough credit for handling these problems,' he says.
Only on Washington politics would Mr Christopher go off-the-record and then
only to respond with a grin and the words 'no comment'. That is, at least,
one proven way of surviving in the capital.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Brazil grants pay rises to quell row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil has moved to resolve a row over public sector pay with a compromise
which the government hopes will head off complaints by the civil service and
the military, but not damage administration attempts to control spending,
reports Angus Foster in Sao Paulo.
The government has awarded pay rises of up to 16 per cent for some
lower-paid civil service grades, while the average military rise was 11 per
cent. The total monthly cost of the increases, which are to take effect from
next month, is the equivalent of about Dollars 129m (Pounds 84m).
The pay rises, partly designed to bring wages for the executive arm of
government into line with those of higher-paid members of the legislative
and judiciary, were less than public sector unions and military leaders had
demanded.
But the government has stressed its need to keep a lid on spending so as to
balance its budget, seen as crucial for the credibility of the country's new
currency, the Real.
The government said a further review of salaries for these and other groups
was possible in November. Brazil's presidential elections - whose first
round is due on October 3 - will be over by then, allowing the present
government greater freedom of action.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Altman to resign from US Treasury post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Whitewater affair claimed its second prominent casualty in the Clinton
administration yesterday when Mr Roger Altman decided to resign as deputy
secretary of the Treasury. Ms Jean Hanson, Treasury legal counsel, was also
reported to be leaving.
Mr Altman had declined formal comment, in a morning public appearance, but a
letter of resignation was said to be heading for President Bill Clinton and
a formal announcement was expected later.
This might include the nomination of a replacement, for which a leading
Treasury candidate is Mr Frank Newman, now under-secretary for domestic
finance. There was speculation that Mr Altman might also deliver a final
strong defence of his conduct.
His fate was effectively sealed last week when the two senior Democrats on
the Senate finance committee - Mr Don Riegle, committee chairman from
Michigan, and Mr Paul Sarbanes of Maryland - privately told both Mr Lloyd
Bentsen, Treasury secretary, and Mr Lloyd Cutler, White House legal counsel,
that Mr Altman had lost the confidence of Congress and should resign.
Since then, White House officials have repeatedly qualified earlier
statements of confidence in Mr Altman and said the final decision had to be
his. Mr Bernard Nussbaum, former White House legal counsel, passed through
much the same experience when he resigned his post four months ago.
Mr Altman endured nine hours of brutal grilling by the committee on August 2
over the question of his knowledge of briefings by the Treasury to the White
House on the status of investigations into the case of Madison Guaranty.
This was the bankrupt Arkansas savings bank previously owned by a partner of
the Clinton family in the Whitewater land development.
He had been serving as acting head of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the
agency responsible for cleaning up the US savings and loan debacle of the
1980s.
Mr Altman repeatedly denied any interference with the investigatory
processes and pointed out that he had been cleared of any ethical and
criminal wrongdoing, both by Mr Robert Fiske, former Whitewater case special
counsel, and by the non-partisan government ethics office. But additional
controversy touched his delay in 'recusing' (disqualifying) himself from the
Madison case because of his long friendship with the Clintons.
He denied Republican charges that he had bowed to pressure over the case
from Mr Nussbaum, in particular, but conceded that he should have followed
his initial inclination to withdraw from anything to do with Madison. He
also admitted that testimony to Congress last February on Madison was less
full than it might have been, though he insisted he had not intentionally
withheld any information.

A group of Latin American governments has cancelled a planned mission to
Haiti to discuss the country's political crisis with its military rulers,
and will instead allow the United Nations to lead its own mission, Canute
James reports from Kingston.
The governments - including those of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico,
Uruguay, Venezuela and several in Central America - gave way to the UN after
suggestions that Haiti's military would use the visit to seek further talks
and delay its departure from office, according to diplomats in
Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital.
The mission was intended to persuade the military leaders to step down and
prevent a US-led military invasion to return President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide to office from his enforced exile. The UN mission was announced
after the security council had voted to authorise the creation of a
multinational force that would use 'all necessary means' to re-establish
democracy in Haiti.
The neighbouring Dominican Republic will allow up to 2,000 Haitians into the
country for transportation on to the US. Nearly 800 Haitians already granted
asylum in the US have been stranded in their country because of flight bans
as part of the embargo of Haiti.

President Joaqun Balaguer of the Dominican Republic has attacked what he
called 'foreign intrusion' in the country's domestic affairs, following
renewed US criticism of the conduct of the election which kept him in power,
Canute James reports from Kingston.
Speaking on Tuesday, at his inauguration for a seventh term, the president
echoed statements by government officials that some countries, mainly the
US, were becoming too involved in the politics of the Caribbean country, and
were intent on unifying it with Haiti. Both countries share the island of
Hispaniola.
His statement followed the publication of a letter from Ms Donna Hrinak, US
ambassador to the Dominican Republic, which was sent to the country's
electoral board.
She suggested an investigation of the May 16 election. Mr Jose Francisco
Pena Gomez, who was deemed to have lost the presidency narrowly to Mr
Balaguer, has been supported by foreign observers of the election, and by
the US government, in his charges that the elections were tainted.

FT  18 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Drought-hit Japan is to import water
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A 30 per cent cut in Tokyo's water supplies is the latest symptom of a long
hot summer, which has this week forced large industrial users to enter the
international market for water, and the government to abolish regulations
inhibiting bottled water imports.
Japan Energy, a big petroleum refiner, is shipping at least 31m litres of
industrial water from South Korea, Hong Kong, China and possibly Vietnam.
The water will be used as a coolant at facilities which would otherwise have
had to cut back production.
Japan's chemical and semiconductor industries may also be forced to seek
foreign water supplies, with local authorities across the country having
called on industrial plants to halve their domestic water consumption.
Meanwhile, Japan Energy will spend some Y11m (Dollars 109,500) on its
initial shipment of 6m litres, but may, at least, be relieved that it is
paying less than 1 per cent of the Tokyo retail price.
Tokyo's main source of water, the Tone reservoirs, will dry up by the end of
August if the weather continues as predicted by the Meteorological Agency.
Bottled water has been disappearing fast off the supermarket shelves and
domestic water producers with order books worth as much as 100 times daily
output say they may have to ration distribution.
The ministry of health and welfare said yesterday that it would revise its
standards on mineral water to bring them closer to international criteria.
The revisions are likely to come too late to have much impact this summer,
but promise to benefit European suppliers in the longer run.
Imports such as Evian and Perrier have a roughly one-fifth share of a
Japanese market worth upwards of Y30bn a year. Others, like Badoit, have
been restrained by ministry regulations which limit the presence of numerous
trace elements. Manganese and iron are among those which may come off the
list.
The ministry is also seeking to relax controls specifying taste, colour and
smell. 'Until now they have wanted mineral water to taste as much like tap
water as possible,' said one Japanese television commentator last night - a
requirement which rather defeats the purpose of the industry.
After five years of rapid growth, import penetration of bottled water
flattened last year. It is commonly sold at a premium of nearly a third to
domestic brands and cuts in employee bonuses have brought greater austerity
in recession-bound Japan.
In this harsher climate, foreign suppliers have found one niche. The
ministry prohibited the manufacture in Japan of plastic bottles of half a
litre or less in capacity, giving the low recycling rate for the bottles as
a reason. This ban has allowed 330ml bottles of brands such as Volvic to
dominate the dancefloors of Tokyo's nightclubs.
With industry now being forced to import water, the Japanese government's
sudden concern about the country's lack of water recycling or desalination
plants has also raised hopes among foreign contractors.
The health and welfare ministry is considering giving more help to regional
governments next year to enable them to build desalination plants to convert
seawater to fresh water, which is cheaper than building new dams.
However, the minister for international trade and industry, Mr Ryutaro
Hashimoto, is insisting that Japan has the necessary technology to build
such water plants.
Its first large plant, capable of producing 40,000 tonnes or 40m litres of
water a day, is already being built in the southern islands of Okinawa.

Nearly two-thirds of Japanese car dealers who do not distribute imported

Of the 433 dealers surveyed, only 0.9 per cent said they were making
arrangements to deal in imported cars and 28.2 per cent said they were
considering doing so. A separate survey of JADA members revealed that
dealers were nervous about the quality and availability of services and
parts supplies for US cars as well as the availability of exclusive
distribution contracts.
Japanese dealers' reluctance to handle imported cars has been criticised by
the US government and foreign car companies as an unseen trade barrier but
the association said US manufacturers and suppliers should address the
concerns raised in the survey.

FT  18 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Brazil-Bolivia pipeline block - A look at
stalled negotiations for a Dollars 1.8bn natural gas project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To the president of Bolivia, Mr Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, it seems simple.
His country has a huge surplus of natural gas, while its neighbour, Brazil,
has an impending energy shortage. Pumping cheap gas to Brazil's industrial
south should therefore make everybody happy.
But, as Mr Sanchez de Lozada has discovered during negotiations in Brazil
this week, contracts involving natural resources and sovereignty over
infrastructure are rarely straightforward. Although both sides agree that
the Dollars 1.8bn pipeline will eventually go ahead, arguments about
shareholdings in the project and the volumes to be pumped threaten to delay
the venture further.
'The project is of the highest importance to Bolivia but no bank is going to
finance it unless they can see the pricing and volumes are right. This is
not a question of brinksmanship or who wins,' he says.
Brazil and Bolivia have long talked of building a gas pipeline but
negotiations only began in earnest in 1991, when a Brazilian study concluded
that gas was more efficient and environmentally sound than other energy
sources, and could reduce oil imports by at least 100,000 barrels a day.
As such, it seemed to offer a solution to Brazil's looming energy shortage.
About 95 per cent of the country's electricity comes from hydroelectric
power stations. But these take up to 10 years to build and the government's
economic problems have halted construction at many stations.
'If the country grows at 4 per cent a year - not fast for Brazil - in three
years we will reach capacity. Gas would be an alternative for this 'black
hole' between the finishing of the halted plants and opening of new ones,'
says Mr Eugenio Mancini Scheleder at Brazil's mines and energy ministry.
The two countries agreed in February last year to build a 3,400km pipeline
between Santa Cruz in Bolivia and Brazil's industrial capital Sao Paulo.
Brazil was to begin by buying 8m cu m of gas daily, rising to 16m cu m
within seven years.
Then the problems started, first over pricing. Brazil said the cost to its
consumers of imported gas had to compete with subsidised electricity prices,
thereby undermining Bolivia's profit margin. Petrobras, Brazil's oil and gas
monopoly, took a particularly aggressive stance in the negotiations, arguing
that Bolivia, one of Latin America's poorest countries, badly needed the
project to earn foreign exchange and that Brazil was Bolivia's only
potential customer on the continent.
The biggest row, which President Sanchez de Lozada and Brazil's President
Itamar Franco have been trying to defuse this week, is over shareholdings.
Brazil's constitution assures Petrobras a monopoly over the production and
import of oil and natural gas in Brazil. Petrobras believes this means it
should hold 51 per cent of the shares in the Brazilian portion of the
pipeline, easily the largest section. Meanwhile, both sides have agreed that
they will take small, symbolic stakes in each other's pipeline.
In what might have been a bid to head off further debate over shareholdings,
Petrobras announced at the weekend that it would work with BTB, a joint
venture between BHP, Tenneco and British Gas, on the project, with BTB
holding a significant but as yet undefined shareholding.
However, President Sanchez de Lozada this week arrived in Brazil saying
Bolivia wanted a 49 per cent stake in the pipeline, instead of the 4 per
cent Petrobras allegedly offered. 'We have the gas, they have the market. It
should be parity,' he says.
Bolivia seems to have raised its shareholding demand as a negotiating tactic
to persuade Brazil to increase the volumes of gas it will buy. Bolivia needs
the extra money to develop its gas fields and reserves.
Negotiations about the shareholdings were continuing yesterday, the closing
date for the original contract, at presidential level. A compromise is
likely, even if the sides only agree at this stage to delay a decision but
extend the contract. 'The pipeline is too good for too many people for
either side to walk away,' according to a member of BTB.
But the arguments have highlighted how much work still needs to be done
before construction can begin. Under the original contract, financing was
meant to be in place by now. But discussions with banks and international
agencies has so far been preliminary because of delays and confusion over
the project's structure. Detailed feasibility studies and market testing
have not yet started, even though Brazil wants to begin construction in the
third quarter of next year. To do so, financing needs to be in place by the
middle of next year: a target which is described as 'aggressive if not
impossible' by another BTB member.
Brazil says the main part of the project needs investment of Dollars 1.4bn,
of which Dollars 600m will be in equity and Dollars 800m in debt finance.
Raising that much money should not be difficult, given the project's
environmental advantages and importance to Bolivia. But the wrangling is
unhelpful, particularly after the World Bank hinted it was unhappy lending
to a project where the state-owned - and autocratic - Petrobras was a
majority shareholder.

A coalition of US companies has joined foreign businesses to oppose
legislation, now in a House-Senate conference, which treats foreign
companies differently from US companies in government research and
development programmes, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington.
At issue is the Manton Amendment, attached by Congressman Thomas Manton, to
the National Competitiveness Act. The Act funds and expands US government
involvement in R&amp;D and manufacturing. The amendment allows participation by
foreign companies only if their governments allow US participation in their
R&amp;D schemes.
US business groups, including the Chamber of Commerce, European-American
Chamber of Commerce, and Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers'
Association, say the Manton Amendment would keep even major US companies
from participating in the US technology programmes. 'Narrow eligibility
criteria discourage beneficial foreign investment, invite retaliation
against US exporters and US companies doing business abroad and violate our
obligations under international agreements,' they said in a letter to Mr Ron
Brown, commerce secretary.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Nigerian oil strike leaders 'sacked'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nigeria's military government last night paved the way for a showdown with
the civilian opposition, sacking the leadership of the trade unions
responsible for the country's crippling oil workers' strike.
In a national broadcast General Sani Abacha, Nigeria's military leader,
appeared to rule out early release of Chief Moshood Abiola, whose detention
on treason charges triggered the strike, which has cut vital oil exports by
nearly half.
Gen Abacha said it was up to the courts to decide whether Mr Abiola,
presumed winner of last year's annulled presidential election, should be
freed.
International oil prices rose yesterday as Gen Abacha's anticipated moves
heightened concern about increased turmoil. Benchmark Brent crude futures
for October delivery climbed back above Dollars 17 a barrel in late London
trading, up some 40 cents from Tuesday's close.
Gen Abacha also sacked the leaders of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC),
responsible for a partially successful national strike call. This strike,
suspended at the end of last week, was due to resume later this week.
He placed the two oil unions, Nupeng and Pengassan, and the NLC, which
represents more than 40 other unions, under government-appointed
administrators.
Gen Abacha branded strikes in support of Mr Abiola as illegal and 'economic
sabotage'. He appealed to union members to go back to work and offered them
government protection.
Gen Abacha gave no hint of compromise with political opponents, describing
them as motivated by local, ethnic or personal interests.
Recent strikes have caused fuel shortages and closed most banks and
factories in the commercial centre of Lagos and the south-west.
The head of state tried to outmanoeuvre his opponents by lifting the
wholesale ban on political activity which he imposed last November, but said
political parties could not be formed until guidelines were set in the
constitutional conference in Abuja. This opens the way for the 360
conference delegates to start planning their moves, although parties and
elections are not due until early next year.
Mr Abiola's supporters and pro-democracy groups have boycotted the
conference, which they say is unnecessary as Nigeria already has a
constitution but has not been ruled constitutionally.
Nupeng, the junior oil workers' union, last week predicted that a union ban
would lead to 'violent reactions from all sectors of the oil industry' and
'from our people in the oil communities' in the oil-rich but impoverished
Niger delta.
The minority tribes from this region are the backbone of the two oil unions,
which have been on strike for over six weeks, demanding an end to military
rule, the installation of Mr Abiola as president and better management of
the state-dominated oil industry.
The ban increases the risk of confrontation between senior and expatriate
staff, who have maintained production of crude oil at about 75 per cent of
normal, and the strikers, who have threatened and in some cases attacked
staff and equipment in exposed oilfields.

Indian opposition parties yesterday ended a two-week boycott of both houses
of parliament, after the government backed down in a dispute over the
findings of a parliamentary inquiry into the Dollars 1.28bn Bombay stock
market scandal. The opposition walked out three weeks ago over what it

a highly publicised bidding scandal involving Dollars 220m (Pounds 142m) in
cellular telephone contracts, Laura Tyson reports from Taipei. Mr Meng
Chih-chung, former director of the DGT's Long-Distance Telecommunications
Administration, was sentenced to seven years in jail for his role in the
affair. He was convicted of forging documents and granting illegal favours
to Ericsson of Sweden. Five other directorate officials received sentences
of five to six years on similar charges.  Ericsson said yesterday it had

<TEXT>
The Australian Reserve Bank yesterday raised official interest rates by 0.75
percentage point to 5.5 per cent, the first rise in five years, Emilia
Tagaza reports from Melbourne. The rise is aimed at keeping Australia's
underlying rate of inflation at about 2-3 per cent and preventing the
economy, which has grown by 5 per cent, from overheating. Until a fortnight
ago, Prime Minister Paul Keating and Mr Ralph Willis, the federal treasurer,
had tried to delay the increase, saying that inflation was manageable and
that business borrowing for investment was still slow. However, the
continuing increase in employment and the strong growth in building
approvals and home lending have sparked concern over inflationary pressures.
The timing of the Reserve Bank's announcement was finally influenced by the
latest rise in US interest rates, the fifth increase in that country since
February.
The financial markets expect the Reserve Bank move to be only the first in a
series of interest rate increases. Mr Chris Caton, chief economist at the
Bankers' Trust Australia, said rates could be expected to go up again
towards the end of the year or early next year. He said rates could peak at
8 per cent, well below the 18 per cent high reached in January 1990.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sri Lanka's political future hung in the balance last night after the
general election failed to produce a conclusive victory for the ruling
United National party or the People's Alliance, a centre-left opposition
coalition.
However, there were growing expectations that Mrs Chandrika Kumaratunga, the
opposition's charismatic chief campaigner and prime minister designate,
would secure enough support from minority parties to form the next
government with a slim majority.
Mr D B Wijetunga, the president and UNP party leader, was holding talks with
chiefs of different parties on the formation of a new government.
But with no party winning an outright majority, the country seemed set for a
period of political instability.
There were fears that some party workers, frustrated at the lack of a clear
verdict at the ballot box, might take to take to the streets in violent
protests. A curfew imposed on Tuesday night was set to stay in place until
tomorrow. 'This is the worst possible outcome,' said one diplomat. 'There's
a big danger of violence and of political uncertainty.'
The People's Alliance emerged from the election as the largest parliamentary
grouping, with 105 seats out of 225. With its ally, the Sri Lanka Moslem
Congress, which won seven seats, and the vote of one independent member, the
alliance could secure 113 seats - giving it a bare majority. But last night
the UNP, which won 94 seats, had not given up hope of holding on to power.
Officials had secured the support of the EPDP, a party representing ethnic
Tamils in the north, which has nine seats, and they were trying to win over
other minority groupings.
Mr Wijetunga said he would form a new cabinet by this morning and pledged to
appoint a government which would have the confidence of parliament and to
act in accordance with the constitution. The promise was aimed at disarming
fears that he might be tempted by party affiliation to favour the UNP. But
officials of the People's Alliance were still suspicious of his motives.
They said the constitution gave the president wide powers over ministerial
appointments.
The People's Alliance fought an energetic election campaign under Mrs
Sirimavo Bandaranaike, the 78-year-old former prime minister, and,
especially, Mrs Kumaratunga, her daughter. The alliance capitalised on
popular demands for change after 17 years of UNP rule. It accused the
government of corruption and of failing to end the civil war with Tamil
Tiger separatist guerrillas.
The UNP hit back by alleging that Mrs Bandaranaike, a lifelong left-winger,
and her allies wish to bring back socialism.
Independent groups monitoring the vote said the poll was peaceful and seemed
to have been free and fair.

A Taiwan court yesterday handed down prison sentences to six officials from
the Directorate General of Telecommunications and acquitted eight others in
a highly publicised bidding scandal involving Dollars 220m (Pounds 142m) in
cellular telephone contracts.
Mr Meng Chih-chung, former director of the DGT's Long-Distance

his role in the affair. He was convicted of forging documents and granting
illegal favours to Ericsson of Sweden. Five other directorate officials
received sentences of five to six years on similar charges.
Objections by Motorola, the US telecommunications company are believed to
have played a role in unveiling irregularities in the awarding of the
contracts. Motorola lobbied US authorities, who in turn expressed concern
over the case to the Taiwan government.
Ericsson, which was not charged in the scandal, won all six contracts put to
tender by the DGT between 1988 and 1991 for mobile telephone switching
systems totalling Dollars 220m. Of the six tenders, two were awarded through
competitive bidding. Citing emergency demand and product compatibility, the
LDTA awarded the remaining four contracts directly to Ericsson rather than
offering them through open tender. Prosecutors have said they did not
discover any cases of the company paying bribes.
Ericsson said yesterday it had always rejected the bribery allegations and
noted that they had not formed part of the court case.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Markets surprised by tax on share profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brokers and market analysts said yesterday they were surprised by the
Israeli government's sudden reversal of policy on Tuesday with the
announcement of a 10 per cent tax on real stock market profits.
Most experts predicted the market would see a wave of selling in the
short-term when it re-opens on Sunday, further depressing the benchmark
Mishtanim index of the top 100 companies, which has fallen 25 per cent this
year from a peak of 250 points to around 180.
They also said the government's lacklustre privatisation efforts would
suffer another blow and hoped it would find ways to allow individuals to
offset the tax against losses.
However, many analysts accept the move brings Israel into line with global
markets.
Reflecting the mood of many of the country's economists, the Jerusalem Post
said in an editorial yesterday: 'There is a glaring unfairness in taxing
wage earners and not stock market speculators and there is no reason not to
follow the example of most of the world's money markets.'
Finance Ministry officials also believe the move could help to stabilise the
volatile market by making highly speculative entry and exits less
attractive.
More importantly, experts believe the government's tax reform package will
help to sustain medium-term growth of around 5 per cent a year and help to
battle inflation, which has risen to 13-14 per cent this year.
Mr Avraham Shochat, finance minister, said the expected Shk500m (Pounds
107m) revenue from the capital gains tax would allow the government to
reduce the tax burden on employers.
Among the measures announced by Mr Shochat are a cut in national insurance
employer taxes from 2.4 to 1.93 per cent from October 1 to forestall further
rises in prices as a result of the large cost of living increase being paid
in this month's salaries. The reduction will amount to Shk300m annually.
The treasury also announced reductions in purchase taxes totalling about
Shk480m on a number of items such as air conditioners, computers, batteries,
white cement, telephones, car parts, liquid soap, shampoo and toothpaste. Mr
Shochat also said he was pressing ahead with unilateral trade
liberalisation, reducing duties on imports from countries with no trade
agreement with Israel. Duties on most items will drop 5-10 per cent.
The effect of trade liberalisation and tax cuts, on top of next year's
Shk800m reduction in taxes, should considerably reduce inflationary
pressures.
Mr Jacob Frenkel, governor of the Bank of Israel, said the cost reduction
elements of the package would help in the war against inflation but
represented moves to make the economy more efficient and were 'not a
substitute for conventional macro-economic policies designed to tackle
inflation'.
Economists said the governor's remarks were a clear hint about a further
increase in interest rates - the fourth rise this year. Interest rates
charged by the Bank of Israel to commercial banks have risen since January
from 10 to 12.5 per cent.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Dynastic triumph for radical Kumaratunga
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL and MERVYN DE SILVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The opposition's performance in Sri Lanka's general election is a personal
triumph for their chief campaigner and prime ministerial candidate, Mrs
Chandrika Kumaratunga.
It was not clear last night whether the People's Alliance, the multi-party
opposition coalition, had won enough seats to take power. But in challenging
the supremacy of the United National party, it had done more than enough to
establish Mrs Kumaratunga as a politician with formidable personal appeal.
With energy, intellect and a radical reputation, Mrs Kumaratunga attracted
the support of many Sri Lankans who wanted change after 17 years of rule by
the conservative UNP.
The daughter of two former prime ministers - the late Mr Solomon
Bandaranaike and his widow Mrs Sirimavo Bandaranaike - Mrs Kumaratunga has
also demonstrated the enduring influence of political dynasties in South
Asia.
It has taken a long time for 49-year-old Mrs Kumaratunga to move out of the
shadow of her 78-year-old mother. Mrs Bandaranaike refuses to countenance
retirement and remains the leader of the Sri Lankan Freedom party, the
senior member of the People's Alliance. The two women have at times
quarrelled bitterly over control of the SLFP - with each other and with
46-year-old Mr Anura Bandaranaike, Mrs Kumaratunga's younger brother.
Mrs Kumaratunga was educated in Paris in the 1960s, where she absorbed the
heady flavours of French-style Marxism. She returned to Sri Lanka in 1970s,
when her mother became prime minister for the second time and launched
socialist reforms. The young Mrs Kumaratunga was given a post supervising
the distribution of land from big estates to the poor.
She married Mr Vijay Kumaratunga, a film star, who joined her on personal
missions to contact the Tamil Tigers, the island's separatist rebels. He was
killed in 1989 by Sinhalese nationalists against any compromise with the
guerrillas.
Mrs Kumaratunga maintained her status as a radical, developing a reputation
as a passionate speaker for the welfare of the poor. Meanwhile, her brother
Anura established himself at the centre of the SLFP, well regarded for his
tactical skills and moderate views.
Mrs Bandaranaike was torn between the logic of promoting her level-headed
son, who seemed likely to make sensible use of the family's political
inheritance, and her firebrand daughter, who was much less predictable but
whose passion for the poor came closer to her own feelings.
In the event, the matriarch was spared from making a choice when earlier
this year, Mr D B Wijetunga, the president, lured Anura into the ruling
party with the offer of a cabinet seat. The decision backfired on the UNP
because it united the SLFP for the first time in years and permitted Mrs
Kumaratunga to take centre stage. Her first electoral test came in March,
when she led the party to victory in provincial council polls in southern
Sri Lanka - to the chagrin of her brother, who headed the losing UNP
campaign.
With real power in sight, Mrs Kumaratunga moderated some of her views,
adopting pro-market economic policies, though insisting that such policies
must have 'a human face.'
If the UNP somehow succeeds in retaining power, Mrs Kumaratunga is likely to
make a dynamic opposition leader. If the opposition takes office, she will
face a difficult challenge as prime minister, trying to hold together a
nine-party coalition. Her warm heart will win her many friends, but her
inexperience could prove a serious handicap.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Fertility rates are down but not enough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UN's population report tells of a dramatic drop in fertility rates in
the past 40 years, even in some of the world's poorest countries, Bronwen
Maddox reports.
In Asia and Latin America the fertility rate has nearly halved from 5.9 to
about 3 children per woman in that period, although Africa (including
northern African states) has showed a smaller decline from 6.6 to 5.8. Even
in developed countries, rates have fallen from 2.8 to 1.7 over that period.
These patterns have forced demographers to modify the old assumption of a
link between low birth rates and economic wealth in favour of a more complex
picture. Some countries, such as Bangladesh, have achieved steep falls in
fertility rates despite relative lack of economic growth. Others, notably
Pakistan and Middle Eastern countries, continue to have large average family
sizes despite relatively high levels of economic prosperity.
The UNFPA draws a close connection between low fertility rates and the
availability of contraception, even where gross domestic product per head
has not risen greatly. It attributes roughly half of the fall in worldwide
fertility rates to improved distribution of contraceptives.
The other half, it says, is due simply to the determination of parents to
have fewer children, even when contraception is not available. Even the
poorest families, UNFPA officials say, work out that they can spend more on
each child if they have fewer children.
Demographers have long agreed that improving women's education plays an
important part in reducing family sizes. But the UN report suggests that
newer pressures are also providing powerful motivation. When workers move to
towns from the countryside they tend to delay having children and to have
fewer. Anecdotal evidence from west African countries also suggests that
looming land shortages are curbing the size of rural families.
These new factors may be helping to push down fertility rates even in Africa
and central America, the regions which have persistently had the highest
rates, Mr Alex Marshall of UNFPA suggests. Since the first half of the
1980s, Tanzania has seen fertility rates drop from 6.7 to 5.9 children per
woman, Namibia from 5.8 to 5.3 and South Africa from 4.8 to 4.1.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Indian MPs end boycott
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Indian opposition parties yesterday ended a two-week boycott of both houses
of parliament, after the government backed down in a dispute over the
findings of a parliamentary inquiry into the Dollars 1.28bn Bombay stock
market scandal. The opposition walked out three weeks ago over what it
alleged was a cover-up after the government partly rejected the
recommendations of an all-party report on the scandal.
Mr Sivraj Patil, speaker of the lower house, said the government had agreed
to 'revise, modify and resubmit' its 'Action Taken Report' which was its
response to the parliamentary inquiry. Mr Vidya Charan Shukla, minister for
parliamentary affairs, said the government would present a supplementary
report to the Action Taken Report only after discussions 'inside or outside
parliament'. Mr Shukla said the opposition would give in writing specific
issues or 'points' that needed to be reconsidered.
The opposition had demanded that the government accept the committee's
recommendations and take action against three ministers - including Finance
Minister Manmohan Singh - criticised in the report. Other demands include
action against top bureaucrats and officials of the Reserve Bank of India,
the central bank. The opposition also insists on further penal action
against foreign banks implicated in the scandal.

FT  18 AUG 94 / UN warns of world's creaking cradle: Annual population
report points to huge strains on resources
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's population is set to reach a staggering 10bn by the middle of
the next century, up from 5.7bn now, the United Nations warned yesterday.
The annual report from the UN's Population Fund (UNFPA), released yesterday,
says the projections assume that the average number of children born to each
woman will continue to fall, as it has done steadily for several decades
(see accompanying story).
If birth rates fall by more it expects the world's population may be as low
as 7.8bn people in 2050. If they stop falling, the total could reach 12.5bn.
The difference between the upper and lower projections - nearly 5bn people,
as much as the world's current population - has huge implications for
prosperity, migration and demand for natural resources. But in advance of a
UN conference in Cairo next month, controversy is mounting over how
countries can try to restrain population growth, or whether they should do
so at all.
Global figures conceal the diverging fortunes of different regions. Africa's
population growth of 2.9 per cent a year is the highest in the world, easily
outstripping Asian and Latin American growth of less than 2 per cent, the
report says. Although many developing countries have seen steady falls in
total fertility rates - the average number of children born to each woman -
they have also seen life expectancy soar in the past 40 years from 41 years
to 61 years, according to the UNFPA.
Industrialised countries can expect their share of the world's population to
shrink given their slow rates of population growth: about 1 per cent a year
in North America, 0.5 per cent a year in the former Soviet Union and 0.3 per
cent a year in western Europe. Meanwhile, their populations are ageing: the
UNFPA expects the proportion of people aged 65 and over in industrialised
countries to rise from the present 12.7 per cent to 18.4 per cent by 2025.
The report flags a long list of economic, social and environmental concerns
that follow from its projections. It warns that population growth will put
huge strains on the supply of natural resources such as forests, fish and
clean air.
It dismisses fears of an 'overall global shortage of food' of the kind much
voiced by 'Club of Rome' school of forecasters some 20 years ago, pointing
out that 'during the past 10 years, the world's food production has
increased by 24 per cent, outpacing the rate of population growth'.
But the report points out that the improvement in food production has been
unevenly distributed; in Africa during the past decade, food production fell
by 5 per cent while population rose by a third. The report concludes that
while production 'should be sufficient to meet all needs for the foreseeable
future . . . poverty translates global adequacy into national and local
shortages'.
Water, as much as food, may prove 'an increasing cause of friction' between
countries and regions, the UN suggests. Rapidly industrialising countries
such as China are facing intense demand for water supplies from industry as
well as from rural populations which are continuing to grow.
Developing countries should brace themselves for huge internal migration as
surplus rural labour travels to the towns to look for work, the UN warns.
The report estimates that 1.3bn will be added to the workforces of Asia,
Africa and Latin America between 1995 and 2020. It adds that cities are
likely to contain half the world's population by the end of the century.
For their part, developed countries need to consider how to respond to
rising pressure for immigration, particularly along Europe's and North
America's southern borders. The UN describes present levels of international
migration as 'hardly significant numerically - about a million people a year
 -compared with movement within countries toward urban areas'. But it warns
that such migration has 'a social and economic impact out of proportion to
its numbers'.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Israelis hail fewer currency curbs: Shekel heads towards
convertibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel's financial reforms are a step towards the shekel's full
international convertibility and bring closer the integration of its capital
market into the global economy. But the changes announced on Tuesday,
allowing companies greater freedom to invest in property, foreign securities
and bank deposits, still leave in place a range of controls.
Restrictions will remain on the right of Israeli citizens to buy overseas
property, or open foreign exchange bank accounts freely in Israel, or
abroad.
Israeli banks and economists welcomed the Bank of Israel's reforms yesterday
as a long overdue step in the right direction, following changes in July
which abolished central bank daily fixing of the exchange rate.
While some analysts feel they do not go far enough, the bank says it is
determined to move gradually in the direction of full convertibility,
avoiding the experience of other countries which removed controls and then
forced to put them back in place.
'We want to move consistently towards full convertibility of our currency
and we want to make sure we don't take any steps that may cause a retreat or
the tango principle of two steps forward one step back,' said Mr Jacob
Frenkel, the bank governor. 'We want complete integration of Israel into
world capital markets and complete competition in our financial system.'
The main reform elements are: Israeli companies will be able to make
unlimited non-financial investments abroad such as purchases of land or
private companies. The move abolishes from October 1 a previous limit
restricting investments to a maximum of 40 per cent of capital.
Local companies will also be able, from October 1, to invest up to 10 per
cent of their equity or 5 per cent of sales - whichever is the largest - in
foreign securities or deposit the amount in foreign bank accounts. At
present only exporting companies may deposit up to 10 per cent of export
proceeds abroad and all businesses could only invest in Israeli stocks
abroad such as those listed in New York.
Institutional investors including provident funds, insurance funds and
pension funds will be able to invest up to 2 per cent of their assets abroad
from November 1. These investments will be subject to a 35 per cent tax on
returns.
Foreign companies will, for the first time, be permitted to raise money on
the Israeli market and convert it in Israel into foreign currency. The move
is subject to parliamentary approval. At present foreign companies can only
raise money in Israel if they invest 80 per cent of the funds raised in
Israel. The move reciprocates Israel's access to global markets.
Mr David Klein, head of the Bank of Israel's monetary and foreign exchange
department, said he was cautious about further moves towards convertibility
given the Dollars 150bn of financial assets held by the Israeli public. 'We
don't want to wake up one morning and find all our foreign exchange shifted
overseas,' he said. 'We want to let companies do as much as they need to do
with the minimum of interference while being sure we have a lid on the total
amount that can be moved abroad.'
However he said that within the next two years Israel could move as close to
full convertibility as many other developed countries without removing all
curbs on foreign investments by institutional investors. 'You don't have to
let every shekel move freely to have international convertibility,' said Mr
Klein.
Further moves by Israel towards convertibility will, however, depend on
control over inflation and continued fiscal discipline. Israel has had solid
achievements in the past five years in budget deficit reduction limiting the
deficit this year to 3 per cent with a target of 2.75 per cent of GDP for
1995.
Performance on inflation has been more disappointing. The Bank of Israel
managed to wrestle inflation down to 10 per cent last year but prices have
risen this year by around 13-14 per cent. Israel is unlikely to take bolder
measures towards convertibility without bringing inflation down towards
levels of developed countries.
However, in preparation for surrendering exchange controls further Israel
also announced reforms in the policy instruments available to the Bank of
Israel. The government increased by 50 per cent the bank's ceiling on
issuing short-term treasury bills from Shk10bn (Pounds 2.1bn) to Shk15bn and
said in future the ceiling would be increased automatically with the money
supply.
The government also permitted the bank to intervene in the bond market.

FT  18 AUG 94 / States act to stem flow of plutonium
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Efforts to stem the flow of plutonium being smuggled from Russia into the
west intensified yesterday.
President Boris Yeltsin has written to Chancellor Helmut Kohl promising
Moscow's willingness to work with Bonn to fight the trade in nuclear
contraband. And Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, said he was
intending to propose to his European Union colleagues that plutonium
smuggling was a suitable case for Europol, the Union's fledgling crime
fighting agency.
Mr Kohl said earlier he would telephone President Yeltsin in the next few
days to discuss nuclear smuggling from the former Soviet Union, which German
officials believe is the source of four seizures of weapons-grade material
in the past four months. Bonn and Moscow have crossed swords over the
suspected origins of the highly radioactive plutonium-239 and enriched
uranium seized since May - the first time that smuggled weapons-grade
material has cropped up on German soil.
The German government said it saw no reason to change its assumption that
the nuclear contraband came from Russian or Soviet nuclear facilities,
despite Russian accusations of a smear campaign by the west.
In another development, German police yesterday raided flats in Berlin and
found evidence suggesting smugglers were planning or had shipped contraband
plutonium to Pakistan. A justice ministry spokesman said one Pakistani
national, two Poles and a German, believed to be the ringleader, were under
investigation.
Mr Kinkel, in addition to pressing the case for Europol to become involved
in investigating plutonium smuggling, is also planning to suggest that funds
from the EU's programme of technical assistance for the Commonwealth of
Independent States be used to develop effective recording and control
systems for nuclear material in the former Soviet Union. The EU is already a
partner in a massive programme to help the countries of the former Soviet
Union stem the drain of nuclear scientists to potentially dangerous
countries
Last March, the EU, Japan, Russia and the US set up the International
Science and Technology Centre in Moscow as an 'insurance policy against
nuclear proliferation' to channel Russian nuclear engineers and scientists
into more peaceful pursuits. So far, the centre has approved 54 projects to
employ 3,000 scientists over the next three years.
But Mr Glenn Schweitzer, the ISTC's executive director, estimates that there
are tens of thousands of scientists and engineers in Russia with knowledge
useful to anyone intent on building a nuclear bomb. 'There are a lot of poor
and disillusioned nuclear scientists wandering around the streets of Russia.
If we've got 10 per cent of them then we're doing well,' he says.
Mr Vladimir Kruchenkov, a Russian nuclear scientist and deputy executive
director of the ISTC, says he has heard of several cases where foreign
powers have tried to recruit Russian nuclear and military expertise. 'We
have heard that the North Koreans are interested in rocket technology and
the Syrians are interested in the electrical area,' he says.
Russian scientists would find it difficult to leave the country. 'They may
also wonder about the long term career prospects in a place like Iraq,'
according to Mr Schweitzer. But he suggests that foreign joint ventures
operating in Russia could easily serve as front organisations. Mr Kruchenkov
suggests there is a greater likelihood that guards or minor bureaucrats who
control nuclear stockpiles could be seduced by foreign powers or terrorist
groups.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Easy to shift, harder to make a bomb with: The nuts and
bolts of a do-it-yourself nuclear bomb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a suburban garage somewhere in western Europe, terrorists might today be
assembling a nuclear weapon as destructive as the bombs that killed 100,000
people at Hiroshima and Nagasaki while middle-men may be trading plutonium
to countries desperate to become nuclear weapons states.
These are the fears raised by the increasing incidence of plutonium
smuggling. But how realistic are they?
Unfortunately, the answer is that smuggling plutonium is pretty
straightforward and making bombs from it not that much harder.
For all the doomsday demonology which surrounds it, plutonium is reasonably
easily handled, and therefore, smuggled. The most common form of storage is
as 1kg bars or small pellets, much like lead shot. Plutonium is a very toxic
metal and causes cancer, yet most of the radioactivity which it gives off
does not penetrate very far. That means that provided it is packaged in a
properly sealed plastic container, it can be handled without protective
clothing or large amounts of lead shielding.
Smugglers, prepared to take the chance that the seals may break, can carry
plutonium in a case or even in their clothing. Their main challenge is to
avoid the airport metal detectors and x-ray scanners which would pick up the
presence of such heavy metal objects.
The amount of plutonium required to make a bomb depends on the
sophistication of the design. US or Russian scientists could now make a
workable design with as little as 2.5kg of plutonium. A beginner with a work
bench and some sticky-back plastic would probably work with between 6kg and
10kg to make sure of an atomic explosion. When that amount of plutonium is
coverted into a sphere it is little larger than a tennis ball.
One snag is that remote control facilities are needed to melt down and shape
the plutonium, since direct contact must be avoided. This plutonium
fabrication is one of the more difficult parts of the process which would be
hard to conduct in a suburban garage, but reasonably easy in any modestly
equipped nuclear laboratory.
The other requirement is that the plutonium is of high quality. Plutonium
produced from uranium in the early months of use in a nuclear reactor is the
bomb-grade plutonium-239, which readily explodes in a massive chain
reaction. The less explosive plutonium-240 is produced after nuclear fuel
has been in a reactor longer, and inhibits an effective nuclear explosion.
Bomb-makers are looking for material which is more than 90 per cent
plutonium-239, the kind of stuff which has been smuggled into Germany.
Once the plutonium core is in place, the next job is to make a sphere of
about 400kg of conventional explosive, typically the high explosive HMX, to
go around it. This needs to be shaped so that the explosive shock wave it
produces is focused in on the plutonium core, crushing it into a ball half
its normal size. The implosion dramatically increases the number of
plutonium atoms which are split apart, releasing enormous energies and
generating a rapidly escalating chain reaction. It is that chain reaction
which forms the nuclear explosion.
For this to work properly it is important to get an even detonation. All of
the high-explosive must go off at once, producing a symmetrical spherical
shock wave to crush the plutonium. It requires some sophisticated
electronics and large detonating capacitors which can be made to operate
simultaneously to make this happen. Anyone determined to could acquire such
equipment commercially, and the detonators are similar to some used in
hi-tech flash photography.
Producing an even explosion would also be difficult for terrorists, but most
countries have conventional weapons designers who could produce such a
detonation. They could also test how effective their design was by
conducting trial explosions around a lead or uranium core, and observing the
shock wave using X-ray cameras. Since they would only be conducting modest
conventional explosions, a test programme would probably go undetected.
Some refinements are normally added to the basic pattern to make sure the
bomb is effective. The plutonium core is usually covered in a metallic
'neutron shield'. This reflects the neutrons which split the plutonium atoms
back into the core, making sure that the maximum number are detonated during
the explosion.
To increase the number of reactions, a 'neutron gun' is also fired a
fraction of a second after the conventional implosion starts, flooding the
core with neutrons and kick-starting the nuclear chain reaction. This
neutron gun uses electronics which could be assembled commercially and heavy
water which can be obtained from civil nuclear sources.
Last, just outside the neutron shield is a layer of uranium which is crushed
by the high explosive and helps to ram the plutonium core into the smallest
possible space.
Such a nuclear weapon would weigh under 500kg, would be somewhat larger than
a basketball and could be fitted into the warhead of a Scud missile. Its
exact explosive power would depend on the quality of its construction, but a
conservative designer might estimate that it would have the force of 20,000
tonnes of TNT - similar to that of the bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and
Nagasaki.
It is, perhaps, a little beyond the ken of terrorists groups. It is by no
means beyond most states if they were able to get their hands on enough of
the weapons-grade plutonium currently being smuggled through Germany.

Britain and France have reached an agreement over the disputed fisheries

agreement, which will run initially for a year, fishermen of both sides will
be allowed to resume fishing in the disputed areas and confiscated lobster
pots will be returned while negotiations on a long-term settlement continue.

The dispute between fishermen in northern Spain and their European
counterparts over the use of drift nets threatens to turn domestic as
fishermen in southern Spain say they cannot compete with North Africans in
the Straits of Gibraltar without the long nets. The regional government of
Andalucia has called on the ministry of agriculture, fisheries and food to
regulate the use of drift nets by Spanish fishermen in the straits and help
them reconvert their boats for other types of fishing. But fisheries in the
autonomous regions of Galicia and the Basque country want Madrid to back a
ban on tuna imports and insist that European Union regulations on net-length
limits are enforced. EU rules specify that drift nets must be no longer than
2.5 km. Fishermen from Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco are not subject to these
rules.

<TEXT>
Eastern Germany's small and medium-sized enterprises are undercapitalised
and face serious liquidity problems unless they receive fresh injections of
capital and easier credit facilities, the Ifo Institute in Munich and the
Institute for Economic Research in Halle warned yesterday. Despite
optimistic official forecasts of 9 per cent GDP growth this year in the five
eastern states, the institutes show that growth remains concentrated on the
construction and food processing sector while the manufacturing base remains
uncompetitive. This is because of continuing low levels of productivity
which in some sectors, particularly steel and manufacturing, are 40 per cent
below west German levels, while wages are currently only 20 per cent below
west German levels. Eastern Germany's GDP will total DM239bn (Pounds 100bn)
this year, but the total wage bill will exceed DM257bn.

The Bosnian Serbs have stepped up the pressure on the United Nations, saying
they would block UN convoys moving through their territory unless they
handed over fuel. Peacekeeping commanders said they would refuse to accept
such demands. Meanwhile, fighting intensified near Sarajevo in violation of
the UN-mandated heavy weapons exclusion zone, which the Vatican announced
that Pope John Paul planned to visit on September 8. The chief Vatican
spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said the UN believed it could guarantee the
Pope's security. Despite tensions around the city, UN officials are still
trying to broker negotiations to reopen the commercial routes into Sarajevo
which the Serbs have closed. The move by rebel Serbs to block convoys comes
two weeks after their long-time patron, Serbian-led Yugoslavia, imposed a
blockade over their rejection of the latest peace plan.

Russia and Ukraine reached a new agreement yesterday on the repayment of
debt to Moscow for the supply of gas. Ukraine agreed to pay over 25 per cent
of its Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 779m) gas debt to Gazprom, Russia's largest gas
company, over the next three months. The remainder will be recouped by
selling Gazprom an ownership stake in Ukrainian gas enterprises. This has
averted, for the time being, Russian threats to cut Ukraine's gas supplies.
Ukraine has already reneged on two previous debt agreements in April and
June, but the Russians have adopted a lenient line. Previous attempts to cut
gas supplies have failed since Ukraine can siphon off gas from other supply
routes - 90 per cent of Russia's supplies to the West flow through Ukrainian
territory. The cash-strapped Ukraine is struggling to stabilise its economy.

A Russian court yesterday suspended the operations of a Russian investment
fund in a move which court officials said could trigger a financial scandal
as serious as the collapse of the MMM pyramid scheme earlier this summer.
Russki Dom Selenga (Russian House of Selling), the suspended fund, has also
become the target of strong-arm tactics similar to those the state
dramatically employed against MMM earlier this month. Over the past few days
in raids throughout Siberia and central Russia, where the company is based,
armed tax police have confiscated billions of roubles in cash from Russki
Dom Selenga branches. Like MMM, the company responded to the state crackdown
by 'temporarily' freezing its operations. Russki Dom Selenga has attracted
over 1.5m investors, company officials say. Russia is plastered with
billboards depicting a typically dilapidated Russian apartment on the left
and a glowingly prosperous western-style home on the right with the slogan:
'Others only promise a better future, we guarantee wealth today.' But,
unlike the Moscow-based MMM scheme, which was integrated into the capital
city's burgeoning financial market, Russki Dom Selenga has focused on the
Russian provinces. The company is not licensed by the Central Bank to trade
securities or to handle the funds of private investors.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Brussels says EU recovery getting stronger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Economic recovery in the European Union is growing in strength, particularly
in manufacturing industry. This is the principal conclusion of the European
Commission's business and consumer surveys for July.
Confidence among consumers and industrial managers has risen. New orders are
up. Capacity utilisation in manufacturing is at 80.4 per cent, up from 77.2
per cent in the trough during the third quarter of 1993.
The overall indicator of economic sentiment - which aggregates confidence
within industry and construction, consumer confidence and movements in share
prices - rose between June and July in all member states for which the index
was calculated, with the exception of Italy, where it remained unchanged.
All member states, including Italy, have shown marked improvements in
economic sentiment since the end of 1993. Capacity utilisation in
manufacturing has also been rising this year in virtually all member states.
In the EU's leading economy, Germany, the increase has been from 78.5 per
cent in the third quarter of 1993 to 81.9 in the third quarter of this year.
Over the same period the rise in France was from 78.9 to 84 per cent; in
Spain, from 71.1 to 74 per cent; in Italy, from 74.3 to 75.4 per cent; and
in the UK, from 80.4 to 84.3 per cent.
Despite this tightening, the balance of the respondents to the Commission's
inquiries who expect capacity in manufacturing to be sufficient over the
next 12 months was still plus 24 per cent in the third quarter of 1994,
although this marked a fall from plus 39 per cent a year before.
Strong improvements have also been registered during 1994 in new orders in
manufacturing and in expectations of future export volume.
For the EU as a whole, the balance of managers reporting a rise in new
orders was plus 17 per cent up in the third quarter, a big swing from the
minus 13 per cent fall in the third quarter of 1993.
Similarly, the balance reporting improvements in export volume expectations
was plus 17 per cent in the third quarter, up from a decline of minus 9 per
cent in the third quarter of last year. In both of these cases, improvements
have also been reported in all member states.
The news, in fact, is good in almost all the areas covered by the survey of
manufacturing industry. In the EU as a whole, the balance of those reporting
an improving trend of activity compared with the preceding month, for
example, was plus 12 per cent in July, compared with minus 3 per cent in the
last quarter of 1993. Also important, however, was the positive balance of
those expecting an improvement in selling-prices, at 15 per cent in July, up
from 13 per cent in June and zero in the last quarter of 1993.

FT  18 AUG 94 / European car sales up 4.8%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pace of recovery in west European new car demand slowed last month as
sales rose by an estimated 4.8 per cent to 962,000.
New car sales rose sharply year-on-year in both May and June with increases
of more than 13 per cent, but carmakers do not expect such growth to be
sustained in the second half. Sales declined by more than 15 per cent last
year, the steepest fall in the post-war period, but demand has begun to
recover during the first half of 1994.
In the first seven months new car sales rose by an estimated 6.6 per cent to
7.5m from 7.0m a year ago.
The recovery faltered last month in Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and
Belgium, but the sales declines in these countries were offset by higher new
car registrations in France and Spain as well as by continuing strong demand
in Scandinavia.
Overall new car sales in July were higher than a year ago in 11 of 17
markets across west Europe. Sales fell by an estimated 2.5 per cent
year-on-year in both Germany and Britain, although in the first seven months
UK new car demand has risen by 13.3 per cent.
All six big volume carmakers in west Europe have increased sales volumes in
the first seven months, while Japanese carmakers have lost ground.
Peugeot Citroen has performed strongly supported by a 14.2 per cent rise in
the overall French new car market in the first seven months. It increased
its sales volumes by an estimated 12 per cent in the first seven months and
is challenging General Motors of the US (Vauxhall in the UK and Opel in
continental Europe) for second place in west Europe.
Mercedes-Benz and Saab have both increased sales by more than a third in the
first seven months helped by the launch of important new models last year.
Japanese carmakers have suffered a significant loss of market share with
their competitiveness hit hard by the rapid appreciation of the yen. Only
Honda raised sales volume in the first seven months.

<TEXT>
A boom year on Spanish beaches has already made a significant impact on the
country's balance of payments for the first half of the year, with a 33 per
cent reduction in the current account deficit compared with the same period
last year. Bank of Spain figures yesterday showed a current account
shortfall of Pta532bn (Pounds 2.6bn) for the six months against Pta791bn at
the same stage a year ago. The deficit in June was 21 per cent down at
Pta138bn, with the traditional surplus in services boosted by 76 per cent to
Pta199bn. The services surplus over the six-month period was 47 per cent
higher at Pta726bn. Net tourism receipts of Pta960bn were 30 per cent up
since last year. Spain's merchandise trade deficit, meanwhile, was 10 per
cent lower in the first half at Pta820bn, according to the bank's figures.
Portugal's balance of payments deficit on current account rose to Es145.9bn
(Pounds 590m) in the first five months of this year compared with Es107.2bn
in the same period last year, the Bank of Portugal said.
Poland's unadjusted industrial output fell 3.4 per cent in July, but was
16.7 per cent higher than in July 1993, according to the central statistical
office.
Unemployment in the Netherlands rose on an unadjusted basis to an average of
465,000 in May-July from 461,000 in April-June, the central bureau of
statistics said.
The Danish national statistics agency reported the trade surplus in April
fell to DKr2.12bn (Pounds 223m) on an unadjusted basis from DKr3.382bn a
year earlier. The April trade balance also showed a decline from March this
year, when the balance stood at DKr3.031bn.

FT  18 AUG 94 / W German prices kept in check: Latest data support view that
inflation is still under control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The steady stream of reassuring west German price data continued yesterday,
supporting the consensus that inflation is still under control. According to
the federal statistics office, producer prices rose just 0.1 per cent in
July, and wholesale prices fell 0.4 per cent.
The sharper-than-expected drop in wholesale prices, which are now 1.6 per
cent higher than a year ago, was due mainly to cheaper seasonal foodstuffs.
The producer price index which has been heavily influenced by fierce
international competition, was up only 0.4 per cent on the year.
Despite this, WestLB, one of the country's leading banks, yesterday
suggested inflation had risen in August under the influence of noticeably
higher prices for oil products.
According to the statistics office, producer prices for heavy heating oil
and bitumen increased 4.4 per cent and 15 per cent respectively last month.
But WestLB agreed with the general view that 'inflation's general downward
trend remains intact'.
The prices situation will loom large at today's meeting of the Bundesbank's
policy-making council in Frankfurt, which will undertake a routine
assessment of interest rate policy.
Other factors to be considered include prospects for continued deceleration
in the rate of German money supply growth, the accelerating economic
recovery and Tuesday's rise in the US Fed funds rate.
Although the bank council may agree with the common view that a further cut
in the 4.5 per cent discount rate is possible in current monetary
conditions, the consensus among analysts yesterday was that it would
maintain its 'steady hand' policy, and leave this internationally sensitive
rate unchanged.
However, some economists suggested the bank might ease rates on securities
repurchase agreements which have been fixed at 4.85 per cent for the past
four weeks.
Although most believed there was still more room for cuts, a report in the
influential Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung which said the discount rate
might fall today was widely discounted.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Fall in inflation eases fears of early move to raise rates:
Underlying rate of 2.2% a 27-year low; FT-SE 100 climbs 43 points
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A surprise fall in underlying UK inflation to its lowest level for 27 years
and a subdued rise in unit labour costs yesterday dispelled fears that the
government would have to move quickly to raise interest rates.
The news buoyed UK financial markets, with the FT-SE 100 Index rising 43
points to close at 3,190.3. However, gilts, which rose more than a point in
the morning, eased later in response to weakness on European bond markets.
The underlying inflation rate, which excludes mortgage interest payments,
fell from 2.4 per cent in June to 2.2 per cent in July, the lowest annual
rate in the series which began in 1975. The Central Statistical Office said,
using equivalent statistics, it was also the lowest rate since 1967.
Underlying inflation is well within the lower half of the 1-4 per cent
target range, which the government had set for the end of this parliamentary
term.
Including mortgage payments, the retail prices index fell by 0.5 per cent
between June and July, partly due to heavy discounting in summer sales.
However, the CSO said the fall may have been exaggerated slightly because
discounting in the sales occurred later this year than in 1993. The annual
rate fell to 2.3 per cent in July from 2.6 in June.
The Treasury welcomed the inflation data as 'very good news', adding that
underlying inflation had now been running under 3 per cent for 10 successive
months - the first such period since 1964.
The good news on retail prices was reinforced by average earnings data,
which showed the underlying annual increase in average earnings was
unchanged at 3.75 per cent in June. Combined with a rise in productivity,
this meant that unit labour costs in manufacturing in the three months to
June were only 0.1 per cent higher than a year previously. Such a small
increase indicates that cost pressures on manufacturers are subdued.
Analysts felt the inflation figures would make it more difficult for the
Bank of England to argue for an early rise in base rates, currently at 5.25
per cent, when the governor, Mr Eddie George, next meets Mr Kenneth Clarke,
the chancellor, on September 7.
The Institute of Directors yesterday warned against a premature rate rise.
'While recovery is continuing it is not yet in the bag and could easily be
blown off course,' said Mr Tim Melville-Ross, director-general.
Nevertheless, with Mr George having repeatedly indicated that the trigger
for interest rate rises would not be current inflation, but expectations two
years hence, some analysts said today's retail sales figures could provide
an equally significant guide to movements in rates.
The inflation news overshadowed employment data, which suggested the
recovery was still not leading to the creation of full-time jobs. Although
unemployment continued to fall in July, the 11,800 decline was below City
forecasts.
The number of people out of work and claiming benefit in July was 2,631,500,
or 9.3 per cent of the workforce, on a seasonally adjusted basis.
Meanwhile, figures from the Labour Force Survey, which was conducted between
March and May, indicated an 80,000 rise in employment in the spring of this
year, but showed that the new jobs were mainly part-time.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Cyanamid accepts Dollars 9.7bn takeover bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
American Cyanamid, the US healthcare and agricultural products group,
yesterday accepted a Dollars 9.7bn (Pounds 6.3bn) takeover bid from American
Home Products after a brief fight to stay independent.
The deal is the largest yet in the series of transactions reshaping the US
pharmaceuticals and healthcare industry. It will create a new powerhouse
with combined annual sales of Dollars 12.5bn and interests ranging from
prescription drugs and vaccines to consumer products and chemicals.
The battle for control of Cyanamid was short. Its management initially
rejected AHP's unsolicited advance on August 2, when the pharmaceuticals and
food products group launched an all-cash offer of Dollars 95 a share.
When AHP raised its bid to Dollars 100 a share, Cyanamid again stood firm,
hoping to attract a rival bidder willing to negotiate a friendly merger at a
price above AHP's bid. But no 'white knight' emerged and Cyanamid's
resistance crumbled. Its board yesterday accepted a further offer from AHP
of Dollars 101 a share after a brief meeting.
Cyanamid's management had been under pressure to accept AHP's bid from
shareholders who were unhappy that the company had spurned the original
offer, which valued Cyanamid's stock at a premium of more than 50 per cent
over its pre-bid price.
That pressure intensified last week when six lawsuits were filed against
Cyanamid by shareholders who claimed the company had acted improperly in
rejecting AHP's first bid. Mr Albert Costello, Cyanamid's chairman, who had
been steering the company through a restructuring when AHP pounced, said:
'For the past 18 months, we have been pursuing an aggressive strategic
programme to build value. The success of this programme can be measured by
the significant increase in our share price prior to the AHP offer.
'After a thorough analysis of AHP's increased offer, our board concluded
that a combination of the two companies will result in a stronger company,
better situated to compete in the rapidly evolving healthcare marketplace.'
The rapid conclusion of the Cyanamid takeover justified the hardline
approach adopted by Mr John Stafford, AHP chairman, during the bid battle.
AHP's initial bid came two weeks ago when it learned that Cyanamid had
discussed an asset swap with SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-US drugs group.
Cyanamid rejected the first offer and, two days ago, AHP raised its bid to
Dollars 100 a share on condition that Cyanamid accepted it within 24 hours.
That deadline expired on Tuesday night, and by yesterday morning, with no
friendly bidder in sight, Cyanamid's management was ready to do a deal.
Investors' reaction to AHP's success suggested they shared Mr Stafford's
stated view that the deal was good for both company's shareholders. In New
York, AHP's shares closed up Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 59 1/4. Cyanamid ended
Dollars 2 3/8 higher at Dollars 96 1/8.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Two computer makers to put health warning on keyboards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Compaq Computer and Microsoft, two of the largest companies in the personal
computer industry, are taking the unprecedented step of placing warning
labels on computer keyboards urging users to take care to avoid possible
injuries from their use.
Responding to widespread concerns about the possibility of repetitive strain
injury (RSI) from computer use, Compaq will put stickers on its PC keyboards
reading: 'Warning] To reduce risk of serious injury to hands, wrists or
other joints read Safety &amp; Comfort Guide.'
Booklets offering advice on computer use will be included with new computers
and keyboards. The advice will include suggestions on positioning of office
equipment and furniture, posture, lighting, vision care and work habits.
Most computer makers, including Compaq, are defending themselves against
thousands of lawsuits filed by people who have suffered injuries which they
believe have been caused by keyboard use. A central issue in many of these
suits is whether manufacturers knew there were risks, but failed to give
users adequate warning.
Compaq said it was not admitting any liability for injuries. 'Even though no
scientific studies have shown that typing at a computer keyboard causes
these injuries, we believe that suggestions on proper computer set-up and
work habits are useful in promoting general workplace comfort and health,'
it said.
Microsoft is about to launch an ergonomically-designed keyboard with an
angled surface, slanted keys and a wrist rest. It will put a warning on this
product, the company said.
The companies are the first in the computer industry to warn that there is a
chance of serious injury from the prolonged use of keyboards. Other computer
companies may follow suit. However, IBM said yesterday it had no such plans.
There have been widespread reports in the US and Europe of RSI linked to
computer use. The afflictions range from muscular pain in the hands, wrists
and shoulders to serious nerve damage.
In the US, RSI is the leading form of job-related injury, with estimates of
the number of workers affected ranging as high as 5m. The American Academy
of Orthopaedic Surgeons has estimated that such injuries cost about Dollars
27bn (Pounds 17.4bn) per year in medical costs and lost income.
In the UK, there were 200,000 reported cases of job-related 'upper limb
injuries' last year, according to the Trades Union Congress.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Archer placed order for Anglia TV shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Archer personally placed the orders to buy shares in Anglia Television
which were the focus of the recent Department of Trade and Industry
investigation into alleged insider trading.
The Pounds 80,000 dealing profit did not, however, go to a stockbroking
account in his name, which in part explains why the DTI decided at the end
of last month not to launch any prosecutions after the completion of the
inquiry.
Lord Archer told the DTI's inspectors that he did not profit from inside
information and never received a penny of the proceeds from the share
transactions.
The best-selling author and former Conservative Party deputy chairman said
yesterday he had spoken to his lawyer who had advised him it would be 'very
foolish' to make any comment about the circumstances leading to the DTI
inquiry.
However, officials and stockbrokers familiar with the case have disclosed
that orders to buy the Anglia shares were made by Lord Archer shortly before
January 18 when MAI made a Pounds 292m bid for Anglia. The dealings netted a
profit of Pounds 80,000 after Anglia's share price soared 180p on the day of
the bid.
The private client stockbroking firm which received the share buying orders,
Charles Stanley, assumed that Lord Archer wanted the purchases to be made
for his own account.
The firm, which has several senior Conservatives as clients, was
subsequently told that the purchases were on behalf of an Arab man, whom the
firm did not know and has not subsequently met.
After the MAI bid was launched, the stock exchange's insider trading group
reviewed a series of share purchases of Anglia shares ahead of the takeover
offer. It contacted Charles Stanley, which disclosed that orders had been
placed by Lord Archer.
Within three days, the Exchange had put together a dossier on the
transactions, which it passed to the DTI. Lord Archer faced allegations that
he or his Arab acquaintance may have profited from inside information
because his wife, Lady Archer, is a non-executive director of Anglia.
After an inquiry lasting five months, the DTI said at the end of July that
it would take 'no further action against any of the parties concerned'.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, made the decision not to
launch any prosecutions after reviewing a report drawn up by inspectors
under section 177 of the Financial Services Act and then receiving legal
advice from independent lawyers.
After the DTI's decision not to take further action, Lord Archer is
understood to be confident he will achieve his ambition of being given a
senior post in government or in the Conservative Party hierarchy. However,
Conservative party managers believe he may be over-optimistic.
Many Tory MPs believe the press leaks in early July of the DTI investigation
were responsible for Lord Archer not receiving a post in John Major's summer
government reshuffle.
Officials have disclosed that the bulk of the DTI investigation had been
completed at the time of the press leaks. Investigators were already
convinced before the leaks occurred that prosecutions were unlikely.
The DTI was criticised by MPs from all parties after it responded to press
inquiries by confirming that the investigation was taking place. Section 177
reports are never published but it has been passed to the Stock Exchange and
the Securities and Futures Authority.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Chemical leak at Shorts factory
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Three men were in intensive care last night and one was said to be
'critical' after a chemical leak at the Shorts aircraft factory in east
Belfast.
Sixteen other staff were detained for hospital treatment after they were
overcome by toxic fumes in a production area of the plant. The Royal
Victoria Hospital described the condition of the other two men in intensive
care as serious but said the rest were 'stable'.
Some of the 450 workers who had to leave the plant because of the spillage
collapsed after inhaling hydrogen sulphide in the chemical milling area,
which was closed for three hours as fire fighters moved in to contain the
spillage.
Shorts said a full investigation was under way. It said the leak was
accidental but could not say how big the spillage was or what caused it.

FT  17 AUG 94 / (CORRECTED) Letters to the Editor: Holding on to the equity
futures dream
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr LYNTON JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 18th August 1994) appended to this article.
Sir, Joel Kibazo's article ('Equity futures trading dreams begin to fade',
August 4) compares certain average turnover figures for Liffe with the lack
of trades on our exchange during July.
In fact, July was a bad month for both exchanges. Over the six-month life of
these contracts, volumes have been very low. Liffe has traded an average of
only 3,500 per month while the OMLX exchange (a screen-based securities and
derivatives exchange, launched in February in Sweden) average has been 1,500
per month. But in July trading on both our exchange and Liffe began to
seriously dry up. We traded no contracts at all, while Liffe traded 788.
This downward trend has continued during August.
The plain fact is that the contract is succeeding on neither Liffe nor the
OMLX exchange.
The criticisms levelled at the OMLX exchange in the article seriously
over-simplify the situation. I would be interested to know how many of the
market participants quoted can claim to be satisfied with the way in which
the UK equity derivative market is performing today. It is, in fact, one of
the poorer performing equity derivative markets in Europe.
Our decision to enter this market was conditioned by the fact that our
existing product range forms a highly liquid and very efficient market. For
instance, the most heavily traded stock option in London is Astra, traded on
our exchange, rather than any UK stock option traded on Liffe.
We felt that we could bring these same efficiencies and liquidity to the
under-performing UK equity derivative market.
The fact that we have not yet done so with the FT-SE Mid 250 Index may be
due rather less to the factors quoted in Mr Kibazo's article than to the
original decision by the London Stock Exchange to grant two licences.
The contract may have stood a better chance of succeeding if only one
exchange had traded it from the start. But we, no more than Liffe, could
avoid picking up the gauntlet thrown down by the LSE.
The problem we all now face is to find a way of reviving this contract and
making it the success it deserves to be.
We intend to pursue this objective, together with Liffe and the LSE, in the
weeks to come.

CORRECTION
The OMLX exchange was founded in London in 1989, not as was incorrectly
stated owing to an editing error in yesterday's letter from Mr Lynton Jones.

Airways

<TEXT>
Improvements in passenger and cargo load factors helped Thai International
Airways to a 3.1 per cent improvement in third-quarter net profits, on a 6.5
per cent advance in operating revenues to Bt15.15bn (Dollars 606m), writes
Williams Barnes in Bangkok.
The company attributed the improved earnings to a rise in traffic, which
lifted load factors (passengers and cargo carried) from 64 to 69 per cent.
However, Mr Gerard Kruithof from Peregrine brokerage in Bangkok, said: 'The
bare figures don't show how much of the profits have been boosted by
extraordinary items like commissions from aircraft purchases and so on.'
He said the airline could have trouble filling the new aircraft it has
ordered. Five aircraft are scheduled to be delivered this fiscal year.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Serbian embargo changes view at the frontier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MALI ZVORNIK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The price of beer in the Bosnian frontier town of Zvornik has doubled in the
past week, a sign that the embargo by neighbouring Serbia is holding.
Diplomats concur, and the local police commander says all transport - except
for humanitarian aid - has been stopped.
How long this will remain the case is difficult to tell. Ten days after
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia imposed the blockade against the
Bosnian Serbs, UN officials and western diplomats have failed to persuade
him to allow the deployment of international monitors on the border.
Yugoslavia - now comprised of Serbia and Montenegro - severed
communications, trade and financial transactions with the Bosnian Serbs
after the latter rejected an international peace plan that would have
required them to hand over one-third of the 70 per cent of Bosnian territory
they control.
But Mr Milosevic appears to be winning the delicate propaganda battle over
the embargo move which his Bosnian Serb critics say is turning Serb against
Serb.
Inhabitants of Mali Zvor-nik, a frontier town 150km south-west of Belgrade,
are divided over the peace plan, designed to partition Bosnia between its
warring peoples.
'Bosnian Serbs want more land than they can hold. There is not a living soul
in dozens of villages around Zvornik,' says Mr Milan Jokic, owner of a
roadside cafe by the River Drina, on the frontier.
Mali (Little) Zvornik - many of whose 5,000 inhabitants have families or
jobs across the Bosnian frontier in Zvornik - was until recently a hotbed of
Serb nationalism. It was a stronghold of extremist Serbian leader, Mr
Vojislav Seselj, the parliamentary deputy who rallied 'weekend warriors',
paramilitaries for violent looting forays in Bosnia.
But in the Cafe Balkan, just yards away from the bridge that serves as the
local frontier crossing, the summer heat appears to have given way to
war-weariness and suspicion.
The town's inhabitants themselves are surprised by the change in Mali
Zvornik. Even in this feeding ground for radical nationalists, Mr Milosevic
so far has succeeded in muting any serious protest against his embargo
decision.
Indeed, the Serbian President appears to have persuaded many that the war is
not in Serbian interests. For the time being, he would be content with
driving a wedge between Serbs on either side of the frontier in order to win
his power struggle against the Bosnian Serb leadership.
Mr Jokic makes clear his frustration with the 28-month long war and the
sharp economic decline in Serbia. 'Half a million Serbs in Bosnia are
holding 12m hostage in Yugoslavia,' he says.
A 41-year-old factory worker who gave his name only as Rodoljub says: 'I was
against the war from the beginning, then I did not dare say a word. Now it
is possible to speak out a bit.
'The war never should have started. Now Milosevic is trying to blame the war
on others,' adds Rodoljub, who until May worked in an aluminium plant in
Zvornik which he says is unable to export because of UN sanctions against
Yugoslavia.
'Of course, many of the 3,000 workers are angry. They complain that Belgrade
pushed them into the war,' he says. 'But a year ago you could not talk with
any of the Bosnian Serbs. Their heads were full of war, but now they are
plagued with regrets,' says Rodoljub of his Bosnian kin over the river.
Zvornik is a mess. Overflowing now with Bosnian Serb refugees, 70 per cent
of its population was Moslem before Serb paramilitaries backed by the
Yugoslav army seized control of the town in April 1992.
Glancing at the portraits of Serbian heroes from the first world war on the
walls of the cafe, however, Veljko, another factory worker from nearby, has
more strident views. 'The people are not divided,' he says to a friend with
a Yugoslav air force MiG 21 tatooed on his forearm.
'Television Serbia is lying when it says that Serbs are in favour of the
peace plan. People used to love Milosevic. But this has now turned to hate.'
But the bravado may just be a cover. 'People are scared that peace will
reveal the crimes they have committed in Bosnia,' whispers Rodoljub.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Tapie to delay appeal on art seizure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bernard Tapie, the beleaguered left-wing entrepreneur, yesterday delayed
until October his legal appeal against the confiscation of his art and
furniture collection by Credit Lyonnais, the state-controlled French bank
that is pressing him to repay his FFr1.2bn (Dollars 225m) debts.
Credit Lyonnais late last month sent a team of bailiffs to the Tapie
family's opulent townhouse on Rue des Saints-Peres in the Saint-Germain des
Pres area of Paris to seize the flamboyant Euro-MP's collection of old
master paintings, oriental carpets and 18th century furniture.
The art and furniture, acquired in the late 1980s when the nouveau riche
demagogue was hailed as one of France's most successful businessmen, has
been valued at between FFr350m and FFr500m. Mr Tapie used it to guarantee
part of his bank loans.
Credit Lyonnais, which is under pressure from the French government to clean
up its balance sheet after the announcement this spring of a FFr44.9bn
state-backed rescue package, claimed it was seizing the collection after Mr
Tapie's failure to repay his debts.
The bank signed a five-year repayment agreement with Mr Tapie in March. It
revoked that agreement two months later claiming the flamboyant entrepreneur
had breached the accord and demanding the full repayment of his loans. Mr
Tapie claimed that the bank's action was part of a political plot against
him by the centre-right government.
He is now suing Credit Lyonnais to try to reinstate the original five-year
repayment agreement and to regain his art and furniture. The first hearing
for his appeal against the furniture seizure was due yesterday morning.
However Credit Lyonnais said Mr Tapie's lawyers had requested that the
hearing be postponed until October 7 giving them more time to prepare their
case.
Meanwhile nouveau pauvre Mr Tapie, who was wont to pose proudly for the
paparazzi at the helm of his yacht, now poses with his family in tow
muttering altruistically about how material success was never really
important to him.

United Nations mediator Thorvald Stoltenberg said yesterday that lifting the
arms embargo against the Bosnian Moslems 'could be helpful' provided it was
not done unilaterally. He was speaking after a visit to Belgrade and Bosnia,
where he failed to persuade Bosnia's Serbs to alter their rejection of an
international peace plan. His comments contrasted with stark warnings from
the UN military in Sarajevo that lifting the ban will lead to further
fighting and a collapse of the UN mission as contributing nations pull out
their troops.
Mr Stoltenberg said he believed the blockade imposed on the Bosnian Serbs by
Belgrade to punish their resistance to the peace deal would be effective in
securing its eventual acceptance. However, Serbia's President Slobodan
Milosevic is resisting efforts to deploy international monitors on
Yugoslavia's borders with Bosnia. Sarajevo, meanwhile, suffered an outbreak
of sniper fire, despite an accord which earlier UN reports had suggested was
holding as it entered its second day. UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi is in
the Bosnian capital holding talks with government leaders aimed at slowing
down fighting and opening up commercial routes into Sarajevo closed by Serb
forces around the city.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Corporate Sweden warns over public debt
</HEADLINE>

Sweden's manufacturers warned yesterday that the precarious state of the
country's public finances was undermining industrial confidence and appealed
to the country's politicians fighting next month's general election to
tackle the issue urgently.
'The big state debt and the record budget deficit are deeply worrying and
must be tackled with credible, long-term policies,' the Federation of
Swedish Industries said in a pre-election list of demands circulated to all
political parties.
'Proposals early in the election campaign and certainly after the election
on how the political parties propose to solve our severe problem in the
state finances can reduce uncertainty and contribute to higher confidence in
the future,' the federation said.
The election campaign has so far been dominated by a debate over how to
control the budget deficit. At 13 per cent of gross national product in the
last budget year, it is one of the highest in Europe and has inflated state
debt to almost 100 per cent of GNP.
The centre-right parties in Prime Minister Carl Bildt's coalition government
emphasise cuts in Sweden's bloated public spending programme, while the
opposition Social Democrats, clear favourites to win on September 18,
propose a selection of tax increases.
But both sides have so far avoided giving detailed plans. The industry
federation, which represents 6,000 manufacturing companies, also called on
the leading parties, which support Swedish membership of the European Union,
to work together to ensure a hesitant electorate votes to join in a
referendum due in November.
'No other issue, besides solving the state's financial crisis, is more
important for Sweden's next government,' it said.
Although Sweden's dominant exporting and internationally based companies are
reporting resurgent profits after three years of recession, manufacturers
remain concerned by weak domestic demand, high interest rates and low
investment rates.
The federation said industry's capital needs would total SKr600bn (Pounds
50bn) over the rest of the decade, requiring investment to grow by 20 per
cent a year.
It warned against raising corporate, capital, energy and environmental taxes
 -a caution aimed mainly at the Social Democrats - and called for a
breakdown of Sweden's system of low wage differentials.

FT  17 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome climbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and SAQIB QURESHI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Takeover talk refused to die down among pharmaceutical stocks, with Wellcome
once again attracting most attention. The shares galloped a further 27 ahead
to 719p. Glaxo, off 3 at 627p, was the name being mooted yesterday as a
potential bidder for Wellcome, although analysts said such a move, one of
the market's long-standing takeover stories, would run counter to the
company's culture.
The regional electricity companies (recs) tried to recover their poise but
most failed to stay in positive territory. BZW was doing its best to inject
a bullish tone to keep the sector humming after last week's perceived
supportive Offer recomendations.
The broker was forecasting dividend growth of between 6 and 8 per cent per
annum, together with the now much-anticipated corporate activity, and
recommending Midlands, up a penny at 750p, Southern, down 9 at 717p,
Seeboard, ahead a penny at 402p, and Sweb, off 6 at 706p.
The oil majors were largely unmoved but the exploration and production
stocks included a dull feature in Enterprise Oil, which dipped 7 to 403p as
NatWest Securities reiterated its bearish stance on the stock.
NatWest said: 'The shares have bounced since the Lasmo bid, understandably
since higher oil prices should guarantee that even if the dividend is not
covered it will be paid. However, at a 30 per cent premium to asset value
the shares still look expensive.'
Burmah Castrol shares were on offer after talk that the stock had figured
prominently in a sizeable programme trade; at the close they were 7 lower at
869p.
Hoare Govett was pointing out the potential of the Chinese cellular market
in respect of Cable and Wireless, together with the latter's recent
underperformance in the equity market. The stock hardened 2 1/2 to 438p.
Scantronic was one of the market's worst performers, weakening 6 1/2 to 20p
after warning of first-half losses.
Food and detergent giant Unilever continued to bask in the glow of its
sparkling results released last Friday, the shares adding 19 at 1126p.
Speculative interest pushed United Biscuits up 7 to 345p.
Argos, the catalogue retailer, again suffered from market disappointment
with Monday's results and the stock slid 7 to 360p. Great Universal Stores
put on 5 at 566p as Hoare Govett upgraded the shares to a hold. US buying
was said to have helped Kingfisher advance 10 to 530p.
WH Smith was reported to be fighting a strong rearguard action over fears
that the Net Book Agreement, which keeps retail prices at a minimum
requirement, may be about to expire. The shares rallied from initial
easiness to close unchanged at 483p.
NatWest Securities was said to have been responsible for an agency cross in
Sears, 8m shares at 118p. The stock slipped back a penny to 122p.
A positive agm statement from Mansfield helped the regional brewer up 4 to
232p. Other regionals also caught the mood, Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley adding 8
at 541p and Vaux 2 at 241p.
Holiday tour operator Airtours slipped 5 to 453p as rival Owners Abroad,
which the former failed to take over last year, announced a name change and
rebranding exercise. The shares eased 2 to 107p. Seasonal buying lifted
Eurocamp 9 to 282p.
Nervous trading in BICC ahead of today's interim figures left the shares 9
lighter at 412p. Profits are expected to be in the region of Pounds 60m.
News of the lower than expected figures for new car registrations in the
first 10 days of August hit several motor dealers and component
manufacturers.
Among dealers, Reg Vardy fell 7 to 184p, while in the component
manufacturers sector, GKN eased 10 to 630p and T&amp;N, in which 2m shares were
dealt at 235p, well below the market price, finished 12 down at 240p.
A two-way pull in international conglomerate Hanson, which reported
third-quarter figures in line with market expectations, brought volume of 7m
as the shares eased a half-penny to 264p.
ICI continued its slide in the wake of the recent downgrade by investment
bank Lehman Brothers, finishing 17 cheaper at 821p.

FT  17 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: HSBC tumbles

<TEXT>
International banking group HSBC Holdings won the dubious honour of being
the day's worst performer among FT-SE 100 constituents as the market
continued to reflect on Monday's interim figures.
The shares tumbled 32 to 717p in trade of 5.1m, with Goldman Sachs, UBS and
Morgan Stanley mentioned among brokers that advised investors to switch out
of HSBC and into Standard Chartered, while other securities houses were said
to have simply hung a straight 'sell' recommendation on the stock.
HSBC reported a big increase in headline profits on Monday, but the market
was surprised and disappointed by the sharp fall in dealing profits at the
group's subsidiaries Midland Bank and Hongkong Bank.
However, several brokers still see value in the shares and have recommended
investors to buy the stock on weakness. Mr Ian Poulter at Yamaichi
Securities continues to favour the stock and said investors should focus on
'the growth in income (other than dealing profits), particularly in the Asia
Pacific region'. Paribas Capital Markets also remains positive on HSBC and
said: 'The recent weakness in the shares is an excellent buying
opportunity.'
Standard Chartered closed 8 ahead at 258p after trade of 2.1m shares.

Software component supplier Micro Focus saw its shares plummet 190 to 873p
as it produced interim figures well below market expectations and issued a
profits warning. The drop came as a further blow to the group, whose shares
stood at Pounds 30 just 18 months ago.
Analysts said the problems at Micro Focus would direct attention to the
company's Pounds 56m cash pile, with speculation that the company may
sweeten investor unease with a share buy-back scheme or a special dividend
payment. The company's performance and dramatic share price retreat also
prompted talk of predatory interest. One disillusioned analyst was not
holding out bid hopes and was advising clients to sell the shares down to
650p - the value being put on the cash pile and revenue stream.
Micro Focus profits fell 40 per cent to Pounds 7m, against analysts'
forecasts of up to Pounds 12m. They pinpointed the blame on delays in
products coming to the problematic software market, together with an
escalation in costs. Profit predictions for the full year were being scaled
back from the Pounds 25m level to just above half that amount.

FT  17 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>

Stock index futures traded in a tight range as dealers waited for the
outcome of discussions at yesterday's Federal Open Market Committee meeting.
Confirmation of a rise in US interest rates came well after the market
close, writes Joel Kibazo.
The September contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 3,155 and languished in
the first hour. The lower than expected PSBR figure cheered the market,
sending the contract ahead to reach a peak of 3,169.
However, a combination of profit-taking together with concerns that the FMOC
would raise interest rates saw the contract give up the early gains.
Following a bout of sideways trading over the lunchtime period, September
again moved forward, this time encouraged by the firm opening on Wall
Street.
But the worries on interest rates remained, which brought another setback
and September finished just ahead of the day's low at 3,153, a point ahead
of its previous close and at a 5-point premium to cash. Volume at 6,766 lots
remained low.
Traded options stayed dull and total turnover was 22,268 lots. Two big
trades in Hanson puts were the only outstanding feature in the stock
options. They were said to have been carried out by Kleinwort Benson and
Monument. Hanson volume was 3,481, making it the busiest stock option.

FT  17 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: US rate rise decision too late to
affect London - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London stock market was again preoccupied with watching for any signs of
a precursor to a shift in US interest rates, eventually ending a tense but
largely boring session marginally higher on balance.
The FT-SE 100 Index settled with a net gain of 5.1 at 3,147.3, having moved
in a narrow range throughout the day. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index delivered
another uninspiring performance, closing 4.1 lower at 3,715.1.
While dealers remained on alert for the rise in US rates, which could impact
on the large number of UK stocks traded on Wall Street, the move of 50 basis
points in the Fed Funds rate came two hours after London closed.
The market began the trading session in subdued fashion with marketmakers
lowering their opening prices in the wake of an eight-point fall on the Dow
Industrial Average.
The early decline proved short-lived, however, as a lower than expected
public sector borrowing requirement number of Pounds 1.1bn, compared with a
consensus figure up around Pounds 1.5bn, boosted gilt-edged stocks and
produced a keen rally in the equity market.
Gilts were also supported by the latest survey of disitributive trades
published by the Confederation of British Industry which pointed to a
slowing of retail sales, a move interpreted in the City as reducing the
possibility of an early increase in UK interest rates. Down some three
points at the outset, the FT-SE 100 moved into positive territory within the
hour, gradually climbing to reach the day's high point of 3,151.6, up 9.4,
shortly after Wall Street opened and while the US Federal Open Market
Committee meeting was in progress.
But with Wall Street faltering, before embarking on another good rise after
London had closed, the UK market began to ease off.
As well as having to contend with an expected rise in US interest rates, the
market has to face a welter of domestic economic news this morning. This
will include unemployment figures for July, average earnings and, most
importantly, inflation numbers for last month. Some forecasters are looking
for a negative inflation result month on month.
Turnover yesterday came out at 511.8m shares, with non-FT-SE 100 stocks
accounting for around 57 per cent of activity. The value of customer
business on Monday was a slightly disappointing Pounds 1.145bn.
Meanwhile, a buzz of excitement went around the trading desks in the late
afternoon as dealers picked up whispers that a big FT-SE 100 bid could be in
the offing.
GEC was one name being bandied about as a potential bid target for one of
the big conglomerates such as BTR or Hanson. This story was mostly dismissed
by analysts, who pointed out that GEC was much more likely to emerge as a
predator than a target.
And traders again began to focus on the obvious benefits of a merger between
British Aerospace and GEC, which have been involved in tentative merger
talks in the past. There was heavy trading in GEC stock, with one leading UK
broking house said to have bought the stock aggressively, while British
Aerospace shares were being chased in the market.
Marketmakers also pointed out that GEC was in a strong position to buy in
its own shares. Another takeover candidate, according to the market, was
Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals group, with Glaxo one name being mooted. The
regional electricity stocks were also being viewed as potential takeover
targets.
Bank shares continued to attract switching, with HSBC again badly affected
by worries of static underlying profits growth. Bank of Scotland and
Standard Chartered were the prime beneficiaries of the stories. Dealers
pointed to Goldman Sachs, UBS and Morgan Stanley as brokers advising the
switch.

FT  17 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow climbs on rate rise of 50
points
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK McGURTY

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices kept pace with a surging bond market yesterday afternoon, as
investors drew reassurance from the Federal Reserve's aggressive move to
higher interest rates, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 24.28 ahead at 3,784.57 as volume
on the New York SE topped 304.5m shares. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 3.78
stronger at 465.01. Secondary markets lagged behind, with the American SE
composite posting a slim 0.34 gain at 443.66 and the Nasdaq composite up
2.62 at 735.51.
Most analysts had expected stocks to respond favourably if the Fed decided
to tighten credit conditions during yesterday's policy-making session.
Indeed, a sharp downturn was predicted in the unlikely event that the
central bank decided to leave rates unchanged.
Still, the rally appeared close to fizzling out only minutes after it began.
When the Fed announced its decision to lift two key short-term rates by 50
basis points each, the Dow jumped to a 20-point gain, only to retreat into
negative territory within a half-hour of the 1.15pm statement.
The sharp swing closely paralleled movements in the bond market, where
traders seemed to be having second thoughts about the rate increase. But
another wave of buying in Treasuries led to a powerful upturn in prices.
Equities responded and the Dow closed near the session's high.
In the end, Wall Street was relieved that the Fed had signalled the
beginning of a period of relative stability for interest rates. Thus, stocks
most sensitive to broad economic trends led the late advance.
Caterpillar forged ahead Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 108 7/8 , General Motors
was Dollars 1 1/8 up at Dollars 51 and International Paper added Dollars 1
1/8 at Dollars 73 1/8 .
Earlier in the session a flurry of company news provided a welcome
distraction as investors awaited the Fed's decision. Hewlett-Packard, the
California-based computer maker, surged Dollars 8 1/2 , or 11 per cent, to
Dollars 87 5/8 after producing strong third-quarter results.
However, its robust performance failed to trigger broad-based buying in the
technology sector. An exceptionally bright spot was Micron Technology, which
climbed Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 43 3/8 on an upgrade from Piper Jaffray.
Several leading retailers also released quarterly results, and the reception
from investors was generally favourable.
Home Depot jumped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 44 3/8 on news of the
do-it-yourself chain's continued growth. Dayton Hudson advanced Dollars 1
3/4 to Dollars 85 1/4 after revealing details of a strong quarter.
Wal-Mart's results lacked surprises, yet the issue put on Dollars  5/8 at
Dollars 24 1/4 .
Toys R Us was marked up Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 35 5/8 after Ladenbury
Thalmann placed the stock on its 'buy' list.
JC Penney was marked down Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 47 1/8 even though its
second-quarter net income of 41 cents a share was well above its
year-earlier result.
Pepsico appreciated Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 32 1/4 after announcing the
resumption of its stock repurchase programme. Coca-Cola also improved, by
Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 45 5/8 .

Toronto rose sharply following interest rate rises in both Canada and the
US. Share prices were little changed for most of the day, but jumped in the
final few hours of trading.
The Bank of Canada's bank rate rose to 5.93 per cent from 5.70 per cent, as
was widely expected.
The TSE 300 index closed 33.1 up at 4,202.8 but declines led advances by 380

Equities in Sao Paulo climbed for the third consecutive day as investors,
including foreigners, kept pushing up prices with heavy demand.
The Bovespa index ended 931, or 2.0 per cent, higher at 47,441. Share prices
have risen 6.2 per cent in the past three days. Turnover was a heavy
RDollars 334m, following Monday's single-day record of RDollars 2.1bn.
Monday's trading was influenced by the expiration of options, while futures
expire today, and trading in futures formed a big part of yesterday's
volume.
Venezuela
Share prices in Caracas made sharp gains following Monday's holiday closure,
although volume was reported as low.
The composite index added 4.92, or 3.6 per cent, at 140.75 as turnover fell

FT  17 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong falls sharply
as HSBC drops 3 per cent

<TEXT>
Active buying by overseas investors and brokers boosted share prices, and
the Nikkei 225 average gained ground in spite of a lack of corporate news,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index ended 160.03 firmer at 20,786.36, having opened at the day's low
of 20,657.28 and peaked at 20,842.23 in the early afternoon before slipping
on small-lot index-linked selling.
Volume recovered from 152m shares to 254m. Foreign and brokerage buying
helped, and a rise in Nikkei futures prompted index-linked purchases by
arbitrageurs. Many domestic investors were absent due to the Obon holidays,
while others remained inactive ahead of yesterday's US Federal Reserve
Board's open market committee meeting.
The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 6.30 to 1,658.68, while the
Nikkei 300 gained 1.47 at 301.62. Winners led losers by 593 to 334, with 216
issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.42 to 1,343.90.
Basic material issues, including steels, chemicals and cements, were
actively traded. These stocks are seen as beneficiaries of an economic
pick-up, and are easily traded due to low share prices.
The three most active issues were steels: Nippon Steel rose Y3 to Y375, NKK
Y3 to Y288 and Kobe Steel Y7 to Y327.
Buying also spread to smaller steelmakers, with Hitachi Metals gaining Y50
at Y1,330 and Nippon Metal Industry, the stainless steel maker, rising Y13
to Y468.
Overseas investors supported chemicals. Sumitomo Chemical rose Y6 to a new
high for the year of Y572, and Showa Denko added Y4 at Y383.
Banks were higher on arbitrage buying. Sakura Bank moved up Y10 to Y1,420,
as did Fuji Bank, to Y2,340. Brokers were also stronger, with Nomura
Securities up Y30 to Y2,260 and Nikko Securities Y20 better at Y1,230.
Retailers, which had gained recently on the rise in consumer spending, met
profit-taking. Mitsukoshi receded Y10 to Y1,030 and Ito-Yokado lost Y40 at
Y5,220.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 72.22 to 23,065.45 in volume of 32.2m shares.
Roundup
The region awaited yesterday's meeting of the US Federal Reserve for an
announcement on a possible rise in US interest rates - a factor which would
have an effect on those countries linked to the dollar.
HONG KONG was dragged down by selling of HSBC and Hang Seng Bank following
Monday's results, and the Hang Seng index lost 119.51, or 1.26 per cent, to
9,366.62.
Turnover remained thin at HKDollars 2.88bn, after HKDollars 2.32bn on
Monday.
HSBC dropped HKDollars 3 to HKDollars 89, its turnover accounting for 20 per
cent of total market activity. Hang Seng Bank fell HKDollars 2.75 to
HKDollars 52.25.
Brokers said HSBC was likely to slip back to the HKDollars 85 to HK88 range
before settling at a new support level.
The Hang Seng H share index of Chinese companies slipped 15.92, or 1.2 per
cent, to 1,320.97.
BANGKOK rallied on heavy buying in the finance and banking sectors against a
background of broad but muted selling. The SET index put on 8.30 at 1,461.71
in high turnover of Bt18.1bn.
The finance sector rose 2 per cent on good earnings reports. Properties
slipped on weak results: Bangkok Land lost Bt1 to Bt79.50 and Tanayong fell
Bt1.50 to Bt65.00.
KUALA LUMPUR was boosted by an announcement from the central bank that it
was to end a ban on swap deals by banks with non-residents in an effort to
encourage foreign funds back into the country. The composite index rose
15.38 to 1,108.18 in MDollars 1.9bn turnover.
SINGAPORE gained ground on foreign buying of blue chips. The Straits Times
Industrial index added 6.82 at 2,308.57, with 192m shares worth SDollars
518m traded.
Activity was largely concentrated on Malaysian shares listed in Singapore.
Brokers noted that the lifting of the ban on swap transactions in Malaysia
drew funds back into the market.
SEOUL's composite index shed 4.71 to 939.0 in thin trading, but Samsung
Electronics, whose half-year profits tripled, went the day's limit up to
this year's high of Won98,900, adding Won2,500.
TAIPEI saw its financial and paper sectors rebound after five consecutive
days of falls, and an announcement by the Ministry of Finance that it would
inject funds into the banking system to ease the tight liquidity. The
weighted index rose 40.3 to 6,583.9 in turnover of TDollars 59.07bn.
SYDNEY ended at its lowest closing level in more than a month as nervousness
about the likelihood of a rise in US interest rates continued to take its
toll. The All Ordinaries index fell 15.7 to 2,040.0 in turnover of ADollars
339.3m.
BHP declined 22 cents to a three-week low of ADollars 19.22. Bunnings held
at ADollars 10.50 after the diversified hardware group said it expected a
continued earnings improvement following a 63 per cent increase in annual
profits.
WELLINGTON lost ground on profit-taking after a post by-election rally at
the start of the week. The NZSE-40 capital index ended 14.67 down at
2,082.97 in NZDollars 40.4m turnover.
Fletcher Challenge, in particular, was singled out for profit-taking after a
strong six months' run, ending 11 cents cheaper at NZDollars 3.93.
KARACHI's KSE index shed 23.99 to 2,247.06 as financials and high-priced
stocks fell back, and investors squared positions on settlement day.
SRI LANKA remained steady in thin election day trading. The composite index
rose a marginal 4.6 to 1018.4.

FT  17 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Baring strategist bullish on Manila

   MANILA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Manila's composite index is expected to hit 3,250 by the end of September
after its recent spurt through the 3,000 level, Reuter reports from Manila.
In the August issue of Tiger Talk from Baring Securities, the broker's
director for Asian strategy Mr Alan Butler-Henderson forecast the climb to
3,250 and said that the composite could regain its previous high of 3,300 by
December, rising to 3,600 in March 1995.
Mr Butler-Henderson said the Philippine stock market could be Asia's next
darling, with a buoyant economy and good corporate fundamentals underpinning
its growth.
He added that the local market had managed to hold up extremely well, even
through the difficult times of the last six months, when a major correction
occurred.
Baring noted concerns about the profits outlook for the index heavyweight
Philippine Long Distance Telephone (PLDT), but said this was outweighed by
strong capital inflows, firming economic growth, declining interest rates
and positive corporate news.
The market shrugged off early profit-taking yesterday to close higher on
aggressive buying, the composite index climbing 5.65 to 3,011.6 for a 7.6
per cent advance since the end of July.

FT  17 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt, Zurich speculate on
FOMC meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With any decision on US interest rates from the FOMC in Washington consigned
to the American afternoon, bourses could only speculate on the result,
writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT had its fun in the post bourse as the September bund future took a
view on the Washington meeting, and jumped 44 basis points to 91.99 on the
proposition that the Fed would impose a 50-point rate rise later in the US
day, a forecast that was later confirmed .
After a rise of just 4.30 to 2,143.14 in the Dax on the session, the post
bourse saw an Ibis-indicated peak of 2,158.13 before it closed at 2,152.65.
However, Ms Barbara Altmann at B Metzler in Frankfurt, said there was little
trading as investors bided their time ahead of the FOMC decision;
short-covering, she added, took the Dax constituents up in the afternoon.
Turnover rose from DM5.1bn to DM6.6bn. Schering, the pharmaceuticals group,
dropped DM42.50 to DM915 as it said that two of its drugs were under
examination, and regained only DM6 after hours after stating that neither
were carcinogenic and calling a press conference for tomorrow morning to
elaborate.
Construction stocks were strong, Strabag rising DM17.50 to DM510.50 on a 20
per cent increase in orders in the first half of 1994. In chemicals, BASF
rose DM4.90 to DM327.20 as its Wintershall subsidiary forecast a profit from
its gas operations in 1995, a year earlier than originally planned.
AMSTERDAM recovered all of Monday's losses, helped by good gains in a number
of the blue chips. The AEX index improved 1.89 to 417.07.
Unilever rose Fl 3.10 to Fl 199.60, a number of brokers having issued
positive reports following last week's results. Among them was James Capel,
which reiterated its buy recommendation and remained optimistic about
earnings per share growth during 1995 and 1996.
Philips and KPN also saw buying strength as they announced plans to
establish a joint venture, together with Graff Pay-Per-View, of the US, to
provide a new media service in Europe. Philips put on 30 cents at Fl 58.20
and KPN added 70 cents at Fl 50.50.
Hunter Douglas shed Fl 1.30 to Fl 83.70 as profits were taken following its
better than expected results, while Wolters Kluwer added Fl 1.50 at Fl
120.50 after announcing a 23 per cent gain in first-half profits and
forecasting 20 per cent growth over the full year.
MILAN returned after Monday's holiday and continued to monitor the political
temperature, following last week's unexpected rise in interest rates and a
weekend of meetings between coalition partners in Mr Silvio Berlusconi's
government. The Comit index closed 9.72 higher at 654.15.
Analysts expect the nervousness to continue, with the 1995 budget due to be
presented to parliament before September 30. Among individual performances,
Fiat advanced L35 to L6,385, Benetton rose L650 to L22,450 and Olivetti L75
to L2,195.
ZURICH took the Frankfurt line on FOMC prospects and the SMI index rose 18.1
to 2,588.7. Roche certificates and Nestle were the most active stocks, with
gains either side of 1 per cent.
In banks, UBS recovered with a rise of SFr25 to SFr1,112, and SBC bearers
rose SFr3 to SFr397 ahead of results which arrived after hours. However,
analysts flinched when they saw the figures, which included a 63 per cent
drop in first-half trading income, and said that the shares would tumble
today.
MADRID fell against the trend, the general index losing 1.71 at 311.18.
Bonds were slightly firmer but most banks were down, with BBV off Pta45 at
Pta3,040 and BCH Pta80 at Pta2,665. ADR stocks such as Endesa, Pta50 lower
at Pta6,010, and Repsol, down Pta95 at Pta3,930, became less attractive as
Wall Street lost its impetus late in the European day.
PARIS drifted higher in a session that was characterised by a lack of
corporate news. The CAC-40 index improved 5.40 to 2,012.35 in thin turnover
of about FFr2bn.
STOCKHOLM staged a modest recovery as the market reversed three days of
losses.
Ericsson, the telecommunications group, provided the main support for the
market, but shares in the forestry sector were also strong.
The Affarsvarlden general index was little changed, down 0.3 at 1,400.3, in
moderate turnover of SKr2.2bn.
Ericsson B shares rose SKr4 to SKr393 ahead of tomorrow's six-month figures,
while Electrolux lost SKr3 at SKr368 in spite of reporting an improvement in
half-year results.
TEL AVIV fell another 2 per cent, the Mishtanim index closing 3.74 lower at
183.40 after the Israeli finance minister Mr Avraham Shohat said Israel's
1994 inflation rate would be double digit, revising an official forecast of
8 per cent.
Mr Shohat had more news for the market after hours when he proposed a
capital gains tax on share profits, specifically a 10 per cent tax on real
profits from share investments. He said that the market would be closed on
Wednesday and Thursday to ease the way for his recommendation.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Fed raises discount rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US Federal Reserve yest-erday announced a 50 basis- point increase in
the discount rate to 4 per cent from 3.5 per cent, writes Philip Gawith.
The dollar's initial response was favourable, jumping from DM1.5515 before
the announcement to DM1.5660 against the D-Mark. Traders reported a surge of
interest in US Treasury bonds, which should help the dollar. New York
trading finished with the US currency at DM1.5615.
The decision by the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of
the Fed, was favourably received by analysts, who described it as a
'healthy, decisive move'.
The rate increase was the fifth this year by the Fed. It said in a statement
that it expected its actions 'to be sufficient, at least for a time, to meet
the objective of sustained non-inflationary growth'.
The Federal Funds rate - the benchmark for US short-term rates - will rise
to 4.75 per cent from 4.25 per cent.
Ahead of the FOMC's announcement, which came at 17.17 GMT, currency trading
across the board was fairly listless, with volumes low and currencies moving
in fairly narrow ranges.
The D-Mark was slightly easier as some investors took profits, anticipating
a rise in US rates. Sterling had an uneventful day, with the trade weighted
index unchanged all day at 78.8.
Analysts welcomed both the extent of the Fed's move and the rhetoric
accompanying it.
Mr Tim Stewart, currency strategist at Morgan Stanley, commented: 'This goes
a long way to instilling credibility in the Fed both in terms of its actions
and by its rhetoric.' He said the dollar had been given a good deal of
support at the DM1.55 level.
Mr Stewart said the dollar would probably take its cue from the Treasury
bond market, where the early outlook was encouraging with signs of foreign
investors buying.
Mr Stewart added that the Fed would be unlikely to move rates again before
its November meeting. He is not predicting a further rise this year.
But Mr Julian Jessop, international economist at Midland Global Markets,
predicted that the Fed Funds rate would probably rise to 5 per cent this
year, still a long way short of the 5.85 per cent being discounted by the
December Eurodollar contract.
Ahead of the FOMC, activity in the interest rate futures markets was
subdued. The December short sterling contract traded only 13,400 lots, but
closed four basis points firmer at 93.23, helped by a lower than expected
July public sector borrowing figure, and the CBI distributive trades survey
showing that consumer spending remains patchy.
Mr Nick Parsons, treasury economist at CIBC in London, said the market was
still 'far too gloomy' about the outlook for rates.
He noted that at the beginning of the year, December short sterling
reflected three-month interest rates at 4.4 per cent by the end of 1994.
This figure is now close to 6.8 per cent - 'a massive turnaround by any
standards'.
Mr Parsons noted that, going back to 1989, three-month LIBOR, as implied
from the futures market, had never closed more than 82 basis points above
the base rate.
But even if UK rates jump by  3/4 percentage point to 6 per cent, the
December contract is still nearly 80 basis points above this level. 'It is
hard to see what will drive three-month rates to 6.8 per cent by December,'
said Mr Parsons.
Ms Liz Ward, economist at Bank Julius Baer in London, makes a similar point,
noting that on the March 1995 futures contract for sterling and D-Mark
rates, the expected differential has widened from a low of 52 basis points
in March to around 200 basis points now.
Ms Ward said that while expectations of higher UK short-term rates should
have boosted the pound, the reverse has occurred. 'The widening gap seems to
have reflected market perceptions of a weaker pound ahead. The causation is
flowing from the currency to interest rates, rather than vice versa.'
She cited two other factors which explain the 6 per cent fall in the pound
against the D-Mark this year. One is that sterling has traded like a
'transatlantic' currency, following roughly half of the 6.7 per cent move
down in the dollar.
The other is that 'exchange markets have ignored strong UK fundamentals for
even stronger ones in Germany'. There also appears to be a belief that the
German recovery is less likely than the UK one to foster inflation.
Although purchasing power parity estimates suggest the pound is nearly 10
per cent undervalued against the D-Mark, Ms Ward said it is difficult to
make a case for buying pounds 'without a convincing move on base rates
first'.
Sterling finished at DM2.3951 from DM2.4061 and at Dollars 1.5401 from
Dollars 1.5467.
The Bank of England did not operate in the morning or afternoon rounds
yesterday, providing UK money markets with only Pounds 90m late assistance
after earlier forecasting a Pounds 350m shortage.
Overnight money traded between 4 1/4 and 6 1/2 per cent.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: PNG copper/gold mine recaptured

<TEXT>
Papua New Guinea forces had recaptured the Panguna mine on Bougainville
Island from secessionist rebels, Mr Paias Wingti, PNG's prime minister, said
yesterday.
Paguna, once one of the world's biggest copper mines, was producing about
160,000 tonnes of copper and 510,000 troy ounces of gold annually, before it
was forced to close in 1989 by a landowners' revolt and a violent sabotage
campaign by the so-called Bougainville Revolutionary Army.
The mine is 53.6 per cent-owned and was operated by CRA of Australia, which
in turn is 49 per cent-owned by RTZ Corporation of the UK.
Mr Mark Rayner, Bougainville Copper's chairman, said recently it would cost
up to USDollars 450m to bring the mine back into operation.
Hopes that work might start soon were dimmed, however, by a BRA
representative in Australia who said yesterday that secessionist forces
would resume guerrilla attacks from the mountains to prevent mining
re-starting. He conceded, though, that the taking of Panguna by PNG troops
was a sign that the secessionist influence might be waning.
Mr Wingti said troops had met little resistance.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: De Beers to search for diamonds
off the coast of Sierra Leone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
De Beers is to explore for diamonds on the sea bed off the coast of Sierra
Leone. The government has granted the world's biggest diamond group a 15,800
square kilometre concession and De Beers will spend USDollars 3m in the next
nine months to survey the sea bed before sampling begins. Another Dollars
10m may be spent, depending on the first results.
Via its De Beers Marine subsidiary, the group has developed unique
underwater exploration and mining techniques. It is operating off the coasts
of Namibia and South Africa at depths of more than 100 metres. Last year De
Beers recovered 302,000 carats of diamonds off the Namibian coast, a 16 per
cent increase on the 1992 level.
The new arrangement takes De Beers back to Sierra Leone for the first time
since 1988 when, after 32 years buying and exporting diamonds there,
country, it quit, blaming the thriving parallel market and Sierra Leone's
liquidity crisis at that time.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee price surge brings
return of Indian export curb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Indian government, unwilling to pay the electoral price of surging
coffee prices, has drawn back from its policy of liberalising marketing of
the commodity.
With assembly elections coming in November in the states of Karnataka and
Andhra Pradesh, the federal government has decided to limit coffee exports
to 110,000 tonnes this year in an effort to curb prices. In the final four
months it will issue permits for only 5,000 tonnes a month.
Restricting coffee exports was not an easy step for the government to take
two years into its market liberalisation programme. Faced, however, with
severe opposition criticism over the 'action taken' on the joint
parliamentary committee report on the securities scandal the government
could not ignore the anger of the coffee consumers in the south of India,
who are paying as much as Rs200 (Pounds 4.10) for 1kg of coffee powder, up
from Rs60 a year ago.
According to the growers, the restriction on exports will create problems
for exporters, who may not be able to fulfil all their contractual
obligations.
The move may not, however, provide much relief to domestic consumers as the
1993-94 (October-September) crop is now expected to be only 170,000 tonnes,
instead of the 208,000 tonnes the Coffee Board had forecast earlier.
Moreover, local traders are said to have hoarded some coffee.
The growers are dismayed that the government has not as yet accepted their
offer of 5,000 tonnes for distribution through 'fair price' shops at
subsidised rates. Though coffee is not covered by the Indian Essential
Commodities Act and it is not perceived as a poor man's beverage, the
government is likely to arrange its distribution through 'fair price' shops
well before the state elections are held.
Although the imposition of a levy on exports is ruled out growers and
exporters see the cap on export as a 'retrograde move'. But the growers are
happy that the Coffee Board has recommended that they be allowed to market
their entire production directly . They are now required to surrender 50 per
cent to the board, which conducts weekly auctions. In the current year,
however, the board has received less than 25 per cent of the crop, causing
it much embarrassment.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cuba looks forward to output
boost
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cuba is expecting coffee production of 23,000 tonnes this year, the same as
in 1993, but is looking forward to a significant increase over the next few
years following the establishment of new farms, mainly in the island's more
mountainous regions.
This year's exports are expected to be around 12,000 tonnes, also about the
same as last year's, according to one of the country's official information
agencies, with the main market continuing to be Japan. Cuba also sells to
Austria, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Spain.
The planned expansion of coffee production is part of a programme to broaden
the base of Cuban agriculture, following last year's dramatic fall in the
production of sugar, the main pillar of the island's economy.
Officials report increasing demand for Cuban coffee from foreign buyers
seeking new sources because of the anticipated tight situation in the
international market.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ecuador moves farther along oil
privatisation trail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   QUITO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ecuador is taking a further step in opening its oil industry to the private
sector.
Concession contracts to operate and explore marginal fields will be offered
in late September or early October. Marginal fields are defined as those
that now produce less than 1 per cent of Ecuador's total output.
Petroecuador, the state-owned oil company, believes that reserves and
production in these fields can be increased significantly with only modest
investment. Under the current administration's oil policy Petroecuador's
limited investment funds are to be utilised to develop the country's
principal fields.
A team of specialists is evaluating each of the 10 wells to be offered for
bidding. The studies will determine precise investment requirements, which
for now are estimated to total USDollars 60m.
'This is a low-risk investment,' says Mr Bernardo Perez of Petroecuador's
contracting office, 'because the fields are already producing and much of
the infrastructure is in place.'
The oil fields combined proven reserves total more than 100m barrels but are
expected to increase following exploration efforts.
The operating cost per barrel of crude oil varies between Dollars 1.45 and
Dollars 6.
Under the newly devised contract the current output of each field will
continue to go to Petroecuador and the contractors income will be generated
by increasing production. The winning bidder will be the company that offers
the state the highest percentage of the additional output and the largest
investment.
If the contractor proves unable to increase production within two years, the
concession will be terminated and the field will have to be returned to
state control.
Part of the contract, which is to last for 20 years, will also allow for oil
exploration in the immediate vicinity of the existing well sites. Newly
discovered reserves will be remunerated over a fixed compensation period.
Infrastructure or machinery installed by the contractor will become state
property after the contract expires.
The announcement of this latest bid comes only months after 10 petroleum
companies won the right to explore and produce oil in over 2m hectares of
Amazon rain forests.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russian crude oil exports outside the former Soviet Union may rise by 10-15
per cent this year, according to Mr Oleg Davydov, the foreign economic
relations minister, reports Reuters from Moscow.
He told the Itar-Tass news agency that Russia had to increase oil exports to
support producers, who were struggling to find solvent consumers in the
domestic and other FSU markets.
Fuel and Energy Ministry officials had said earlier that 1994 crude exports
would total more than last year's 80m tonnes but ruled out a sharp increase
in sales to the West because of limited port and pipeline capacity.
Mr Davydov mentioned the capacity restrictions on oil exports but said that
new avenues were opening up, including through Ukraine, which had lowered
transit tariffs to Dollars 5-Dollars 6 a tonne from Dollars 8-Dollars 11.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ukraine to boost coal imports
and exports - A look at a paradoxical legacy of the Soviet era
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JILL BARSHAY and MATTHEW KAMINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ukraine will, paradoxically, both import and export more coal this year,
illustrating how Soviet regulatory hangovers create shortages at home while
western trade brings much-needed hard currency profits.
The once mighty coal producer, saddled with exhausted pits and antiquated
technology, annouced this week that falling production would force it to
import 15m tonnes of coal to meet minimum domestic needs.
Ukraine remains keen, however, to keep exports at 12m tonnes a year, up from
10m tonnes in 1989. Its main customers are the UK, Belgium and Italy, who
pay between Dollars 21 and Dollars 100 a tonne, depending on quality.
Domestic prices are roughly half that - ranging from 500,000 to 1.7m
Ukrainian karbovanets (Dollars 11.6 to Dollars 39.50) a tonne - because they
are set by regulations linking selling prices to production cost. So the
state coal committee, which receives coal from the pits and distributes it
to users, likes to skim off as much as possible for the more lucrative
export markets.
'We have an unlimited amount of coal for the next 100 years in the Donbass.
But we need modern equipment. This is why we are exporting coal for hard
currency,' says Mr Sergei Fishenko, head of the government's coal
department.
A traditional coal exporter, Ukraine this year will produce 100m tonnes,
down from 131.9m last year. To bridge the gap, it plans to barter metals for
coal from Russia and Poland, former trading partners under the old Comecon
regime, enabling it to satisfy its western customers.
The Ukrainian government has been unwilling to liberalise energy prices,
even though mounting shortages suggest no other practical option. This
deepens the energy crisis and delays restructuring of heavy industry away
from energy-intensive activities.
The mining sector, once a Soviet showcase, mirrors Ukraine's economic
plight. The heavily subsidised mines in the country's eastern Donbass region
drain state coffers with minimal return: the 1.2m coal miners at 262 mines -
5 per cent of the labour force - produce, on average, 5 per cent of the coal
a western coal miner does; and the Kiev government is this year paying about
Dollars 50m a month in subsidies.
The productivity gap can be blamed partly on antiquated equipment, which
itself carries a high environmental cost. Ukraine's coal pits contribute 3
per cent (2.2bn cubic meters) of the world's emission of methane, a
greenhouse gas associated with global warming. Accidents are another
problem. Some four miners die for every 1m of coal produced - the highest
rate in the world - MDNM/ in the Donetsk district alone 213 people were
killed last year.
Many mines should be closed; but that would carry the politically
unpalatable social cost of mounting unemployment.
Despite a poor summer crop, Ukraine will not import grain this year, the
Food and Agriculture Department announced this week.
Last year it produced 45m tonnes but analysts expect this year's crop to be
below 40m; and the announcement that it will not resort to imports comes as
a surprise.
A summer drought helped push yields down, but Mr Csaba Csaki, an
agroeconomist at the World Bank in Washington, commented: 'The inherited
inefficiency of the collectives and input supplies and the trade break-down
are the real problem - just don't blame the weather'.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries rally on news of higher rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Longer-dated US Treasury bonds surged yesterday afternoon after the Federal
Reserve announced a move to lift short-term interest rates.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was 1 9/16 higher
at 101 7/16 , with the yield dropping to 7.374 per cent. The two-year note
was  3/16 firmer at 99 7/8 , yielding 6.175 per cent.
The initial reaction to the announcement was decidedly positive. Prices on
the inflation-sensitive long bond jumped on news that the central bank had
decided to push up the Federal Funds target rate by 50 basis points to 4.75
per cent and the discount rate by 50 basis points to 4 per cent.
The Fed said the action was intended to contain inflation, reassuring
traders about the long-term value of their fixed-rate investments.
Even though the move placed more upward pressure on short-term yields,
prices on shorter-term paper also improved, albeit modestly.
There was general relief that the Fed had decided against lifting the Fed
funds target by only 25 basis points and leaving the discount rate
unchanged. The more timid approach would have immediately raised the
prospect of yet another tightening, perhaps as early as next month.
Yesterday the Fed said it expected its action to be 'sufficient at least for
a time,' signalling a period of relative stability for the Treasury market.
Still, the strength of the rally was somewhat surprising because the Fed's
move was widely anticipated. After a lacklustre session on Monday, dealers
had ventured back into the market yesterday morning as the Fed's
policy-making arm was convening in Washington. In a change of heart, many
traders had decided the market would move higher, not lower, if the Fed
meeting resulted in a more restrictive monetary policy.
As a consequence, dealers had spent the morning 'short-covering,' that is,
replacing securities they had borrowed and resold in earlier sessions on a
bet that prices would fall on the news.
Yesterday's activity pushed bonds moderately higher before the news, which
broke at 1.15pm, local time.
The market's guess proved accurate, but its subsequent rally appeared to be
fizzling out only minutes after it began in earnest. However, a second wave
of buying, apparently by retail accounts, carried prices to session highs by
the late afternoon.
News of the rate increase in the US came too late to affect European
government bond markets.
Earlier in the day, price movements in Europe reflected a flight to quality
as investors abandoned the high-yielding markets of Italy, Spain and Sweden
for the relative safety of Germany and France.
The high-yielding markets experienced losses of up to  3/4 points while
Germany and France saw gains of around  1/2 point.
One dealer said the flows out of the high-deficit countries underlined the
view among investors that the fiscal imbalances were not going away and that
the situation would only get worse in a bear market.
However, volume was low across the board as traders waited for news from the
Federal Reserve.
In Germany, the Bundesbank's announcement that it was setting a fixed-rate
repo at 4.85 per cent came as no surprise.
This brings to an end the scheduled run of four fixed-rate repos which the
Bundesbank put in place ahead of its summer break.
The market is now waiting to see if the central bank will revert back to a
variable rate. The Bundesbank is due to meet tomorrow. On Liffe, the
September bund future stood 0.45 point higher in late trading at 91.96.
UK gilts were also among the day's outperformers, buoyed by a smaller than
expected UK Public Sector Borrowing Requirement for July and the
Confederation of British Industry's distributive trades survey, which showed
no signs of rampant economic growth.
On Liffe, the September long gilt future rose to 101 11/32 in modest volume
of 50,100 lots.

Hyundai Motor, South Korea's largest manufacturer of cars, reported net
profits of Won68.2bn (Dollars 85m) for the first half of 1994, a 343 per
cent advance on the corresponding period last year, during which the company
was hit by almost two months of industrial action.
Sales rose by 27 per cent to Won4,270bn, buoyed by strong demand in the
domestic market, one of the world's fastest-growing.
Exports have also increased as a result of the weak Korean won boosting
foreign sales at the expense of Japanese models, sales of which have been
hit by the strong Japanese yen.
However, Hyundai Motor Service, the group's sales and maintenance
subsidiary, suffered a 30 per cent fall in net earnings to Won13.8bn because
of generous financing terms offered to customers as part of a marketing war
among the country's car companies. Sales rose by 23 per cent to Won2,269bn.
Kia Motors, Korea's second-largest car producer, suffered a 30 per cent fall
in profits to Won3.8bn because of investment costs as it expands its car
facility at Asan.
Profits were also affected by the higher cost of importing Japanese
components as a result of the stronger yen, which also caused foreign
exchange losses on the company's yen-dominated debt. Kia is 8 per cent owned
by Mazda, the Japanese car company.
Sales rose by 23 per cent to Won2,300bn.
Asia Motors, the Kia-controlled commercial vehicle manufacturer, achieved a
229 per cent increase in profits to Won4.4bn, while sales rose by 28 per
cent to Won608bn.
A recovery in facility and public infrastructure construction has increased
demand for its range of heavy trucks and other construction vehicles.

FT  17 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: S&amp;P affirms long-term credit
rating for Turkey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turkey's rating outlook may be stabilising following several credit rating
downgrades earlier this year.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, yesterday affirmed its B+ rating
for Turkey's long-term foreign currency debt. S&amp;P also said it was removing
Turkey from CreditWatch, and that its rating outlook is now stable.
Turkey's ratings came under heavy pressure from the severe deterioration in
the country's public finances and the sharp fall in its foreign currency
reserves early in the year. In January, S&amp;P downgraded Turkey's foreign debt
rating to BBB - from BBB; in March it was lowered again, to BB, and the
country was placed on CreditWatch with negative implications; in April it
was again lowered, to B+.
But according to S&amp;P, its latest rating action 'reflects Turkey's improved
fiscal performance in the second quarter of 1994, which, in turn, has helped
stabilise the Turkish lira, partially restore the government's foreign
exchange reserves and greatly reduce inflation.'

handful of new issues saw the light of day.
However, against the backdrop of rising US interest rates, a Dollars 500m
five-year floating-rate issue for the UK's Halifax Building Society received
a warm welcome. The notes, which pay a coupon of three-month Libor, were
issued at 99.645 where they yield 8 basis points over Libor.
While some traders felt the pricing was on the tight side, most said the
issue met good demand. 'With interest rates rising, people's appetite for
floating-rate paper is growing,' said a syndicate manager.
According to an official at HSBC, which led the deal jointly with Lehman
Brothers, the Halifax's debut in the dollar floating-rate sector 'went
better than expected,' attracting demand from banks, institutions, building
societies and money market funds.
Dealers said the deal was also supported by a recent dearth of supply in the
FRN sector, which had caused yield spreads in the secondary market to narrow
sharply.
Elsewhere, General Electric Capital Canada issued CDollars 100m of 8 7/8 per
cent five-year notes via Merrill Lynch. The bonds were priced to yield 10
basis points over the corresponding Canadian benchmark, which most dealers
considered appropriate given that previous Canadian dollar issues for GECC
trade at even tighter spreads.
Aegon NV, the Dutch life insurance and pension management company, made its
debut in the US domestic bond market with Dollars 400m of 12-year
subordinated bonds. Despite the bonds' unusual maturity and subordinated
status, the deal met strong demand, said lead manager J. P. Morgan.
Although issuance is expected to remain thin this week, there was some talk
that Denmark might tap the euroyen sector with some structured issues
targeted at Japanese retail investors.
There was also talk that Japanese government-backed agencies might tap the
10-year dollar sector soon.
Barclays Overseas Investment Company BV announced the early repayment of all
its DM250m 8 1/8 per cent bearer bonds due 1998. Repayment of the bonds,
which were issued in 1983, will take place on December 1 at 101 per cent of
par value.

FT  17 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Ecu loan for Spain gets
strong response
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Kingdom of Spain's recently-announced Ecu6bn five-year revolving credit
facility has been substantially oversubscribed.
Chemical Bank, as arranger, said, excluding its own commitment of Ecu1.65bn,
commitments totalling Ecu16bn had been received from 23 banks when
underwriting closed on Friday. Eighteen banks have committed as senior lead
managers and five banks as lead managers.
As a result of the strong response, commitments allocated to senior lead
managers and lead managers have been scaled back significantly from the
targets of Ecu750m and Ecu500m respectively.
Senior lead managers will be asked to underwrite around Ecu258m each and
lead managers around Ecu215m. Chemical's commitment has been reduced to
around Ecu280m.
General syndication will start on or around August 19, which will give
underwriters an opportunity to reduce their commitments further.
The senior lead managers are: ABN-Amro Bank, Banco Central Hispanoamericano,
Banco de Negocios Argentaria, Banco Santander de Negocios, Barclays Bank,
Bayerische Landesbank Girozentrale, Bayerische Vereinsbank, BNP Capital
Markets, La Caixa, Commerzbank, Credit Suisse, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank,
Dresdner Bank, Fuji Bank, Industrial Bank of Japan, Sanwa Bank, Sumitomo
Bank and WestLB.
The lead managers are Bank of Tokyo, Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan,
Mitsubishi Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland and Sakura Bank.

<TEXT>
Continued weakness in Wal-Mart Stores' warehouse club operations checked the
US discount store group's rate of profits growth at 14 per cent in the
second quarter to July, the company reported yesterday.
The figures, however, were in sharp contrast with the worsening losses
reported by Kmart, Wal-Mart's biggest rival, the day before. They were also
at the upper end of the market's expectations, and the shares rose Dollars
5/8 to Dollars 24 1/4 yesterday.
Net income for the quarter rose to Dollars 564.8m from Dollars 495.9m on
record sales of Dollars 19.9bn, up 23 per cent. Earnings per share rose to
25 cents from 22 cents.
For the six months to July, sales rose 25 per cent to Dollars 37.6bn, net
income advanced 12 per cent to Dollars 1.1bn and earnings per share
increased 12 per cent to 46 cents.
Until recently Wal-Mart had rewarded shareholders with compound earnings
growth averaging 25 per cent a year, but that pace began to flag last year
because of the poor performance of the warehouse club operations.
In the latest quarter, sales of the Sam's Clubs rose by 32 per cent to
Dollars 4.8bn, but that was because Wal-Mart added the Pace Membership
Warehouse division bought from Kmart last year. On a store-for-store basis,
sales were 3.6 per cent lower.
In contrast, sales in the core Wal-Mart discount store division were 9.7 per
cent ahead on a store-for-store basis.
The division's total sales rose by 22 per cent to Dollars 14.2bn, boosted by
new store openings and the acquisition and conversion of Woolworth's Woolco
stores in Canada.
Mr David Glass, chief executive, said the company's performance in a very
competitive quarter, together with the planned conversion of the remaining
Woolco stores in Canada, made him 'optimistic' about the remainder of the
year.
J. C. Penney and Dayton Hudson, two of the biggest US department store
groups, both reported continued profits growth in the second quarter
yesterday.
J. C. Penney increased net income by 17 per cent to Dollars 132m and Dayton
Hudson more than doubled net income from Dollars 24m to Dollars 49m.

FT  17 AUG 94 / International Company News: TWA loss deepens to Dollars 57m
as interest payments rise

Net losses at Trans World Airlines, the struggling US carrier, deepened to
Dollars 57m from Dollars 52.3m in the second quarter to June.
The airline also ended the period with net cash down from Dollars 135m at
the end of the first quarter to just Dollars 116.5m.
The company said total revenues rose by 11.7 per cent to Dollars 885.8m and
operating losses fell from Dollars 31m a year earlier to Dollars 17.4m.
Interest payments, however, rose by Dollars 19.7m because of new debt issued
in connection with its emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in
November last year.
TWA, which is 45 per cent owned by its employees, has not made a profit
since emerging from bankruptcy.
All its credit facilities are drawn, virtually all its assets are pledged,
and it has insufficient cash to repay Dollars 190m worth of debt falling due
for repayment in January.
Earlier this month it announced plans to cut costs by shedding up to 3,000
jobs, or 12 per cent of its workforce.
It also announced the closure of its operations in Geneva and Zurich,
Switzerland, and the suspension of polar flights between Los Angeles and
Paris for the winter.
TWA said losses at its Atlanta hub were a substantial contributor to the
latest operating loss. At the end of May, TWA reduced its presence at
Atlanta, cutting daily flights from 57 to 11 and transferring them to its
profitable St Louis hub in Missouri.
Mr Jeffrey Erickson, promoted last week from chief operating officer to
chief executive, said the latest results added urgency to the need for
management and employees to unite in their efforts to 're-invent' TWA.
'We are moving forward quickly to finalise a new business plan and complete
historic negotiations with our unions to improve productivity,' he said.
TWA does not expect its financial position to improve substantially and it
may be forced to sell assets or seek outside financing to stay aloft,
according to papers filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission,
Reuter adds from New York.
The airline also said it was uncertain whether restructuring plans can be
implemented quickly enough to stabilise its precarious footing.
TWA said it may sell its Midcoast Aviation Inc subsidiary, which maintains,
services and owns small aircraft, and its International Aviation Security
unit, which provides airport security to TWA and other carriers. Potential
asset sales could generate Dollars 38m by the end of the year, the filing
said.

Hyundai Corporation, the trading arm of South Korea's largest conglomerate,
has reported a 47 per cent rise in net earnings, to Won5.3bn (Dollars 6.6m)
for the first half of 1994, writes John Burton.
Sales rose 24 per cent to Won6,323bn.
The improved results reflect increased exports, which benefited from the
weak Korean currency.

third-biggest industrial group, has reported a 157 per cent increase in
profits, to Won3bn. Sales grew by 27.7 per cent to Won2,431bn.
Sunkyong Ltd, the fifth-largest trading house, suffered a 36 per cent fall
in earnings, to Won3.2bn. It blamed growing investment costs, including the
recent purchase of a controlling stake in Korea Mobile Telecom, the cellular
telephone monopoly.
Ssangyong Corporation, the sixth-biggest trading company, had a 32 per cent

Australia's largest food processor, Goodman Fielder, said its chairman, Mr
John Studdy, would stand down once an external successor is found and that
two additional non-executive directors would be appointed, Reuter reports
from Sydney.
The company's future has been under a cloud recently after a revolt by
shareholders, led by Melbourne businessman Mr Doug Shears, whose company
Agrifood Australia owns 3.5 per cent of the stock.
'While Mr Studdy has the full support of the board, he recognises the need
for a succession plan and the appointment in due course of an external
successor,' Goodman said.
'The chairman has indicated a desire and a willingness to stand down when a
successor has been found. This transition will ensure the stability of the
board and will allow the board to continue its process of change.'
Mr Shears had rallied three groups of institutional investors with a
combined shareholding of just under 16 per cent to his side.
Goodman has recorded flat profits for the past five years, resulting in its
share price remaining little changed over the same period.

FT  17 AUG 94 / International Company News: Castle Energy says its future
hangs on MG Corp's goodwill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Castle Energy, the Pennsylvania-based oil refiner that featured earlier this
year in the near-collapse of Metallgesellschaft, the German engineering
group, said yesterday that its future depended on the diminishing goodwill
of its largest shareholder, MG Corp, Metallgesellschaft's New York-based
subsidiary.
'The uncertainties resulting from MG's and its affiliates' possible
inability or unwillingness to continue to meet their obligations to the
company raise substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a
going concern,' Castle said in its quarterly regulatory filing.
Metallgesellschaft has said that it is seeking to end its affiliation with
Castle, which it deems not to be in MG Corp's best interest.
Negotiations between Castle and the Metallgesellschaft group of companies to
restructure contractual and other relationships are continuing, Castle
confirmed yesterday.
MG Corp, which has a 43.2 per cent stake in Castle, is contractually obliged
to purchase almost all of Castle's refinery output at above-market prices
for the remainder of this century. MG Corp is also Castle's major creditor
and source of capital.
In its third quarter, Castle said it earned Dollars 4.3m, or 35 cents a
share, on sales of Dollars 268m. That compares with profits of Dollars 5.1m,
or 65 cents, on sales of Dollars 154m in the same 1993 period.
The increase was mainly due to the company's acquisition of Powerine Oil in
October 1993.
Castle issued 2.8m shares to the public in November, and sold additional
shares to MG Corp, diluting per-share earnings. The company had 12.4m shares
at the end of the third quarter, compared with 7.9m shares at the end of
last year's third quarter.
For the nine months ended June 30, Castle said it had profits of Dollars
19.4m, or Dollars 1.69 a share, on sales of Dollars 683m, up from the
year-ago period's profits of Dollars 15.1m, or Dollars 2.14 a share, on
sales of Dollars 456m.

FT  17 AUG 94 / International Company News: PepsiCo shares leap on buy-back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in PepsiCo, the US soft drinks and fast food company, jumped Dollars
1 1/8 to close at Dollars 32 1/4 yesterday after the company announced that
it planned to resume buying back its own stock.
Under a share repurchase programme that came into effect in July last year,
the company can buy back 39.6m, or 5 per cent, of its 792m shares in issue.
The original programme authorised the repurchase of 50m shares, of which
10.4m have already been bought back.
PepsiCo's shares have been under a cloud since June when the company
announced that a price war in the US cola market and poor performances from
its fast food operations would result in flat second-quarter profits.
The share price plummeted by 9 per cent to Dollars 31 1/2 on the news, and
has been hovering around that level since.
Mr Wayne Calloway, chairman and chief executive, said: 'With our seasonally
strengthening cash flow and the relative valuation of our shares lower than
it's been in years, buying PepsiCo stock makes good sense for us right now.'

FT  17 AUG 94 / International Company News: Hewlett-Packard sustains growth
rate in third term

<TEXT>
Hewlett-Packard, the pace-setter of the computer industry, maintained its
rapid growth in its third quarter with revenues up 22 per cent and a 27 per
cent rise in orders.
'We had a very good quarter, with excellent order and revenue growth and
substantial profit improvement,' said Mr Lew Platt, chairman, president and
chief executive.
'We have good momentum going into the fourth quarter,' he said. But, with
typical caution, he added that in spite of improvement in the global
economy, 'we expect the competitive environment to remain intense'.
Net earnings for the third quarter to July 31 were Dollars 347m, or Dollars
1.33 a share, up from Dollars 271m, or Dollars 1.06, in the same period last
year. Earnings per share for the third quarter of 1994 were reduced by 3
cents through the inclusion of employee stock options in the number of
outstanding shares.
Net revenue was Dollars 6.1bn, up from Dollars 5.0bn last year. Net revenue
in the US was Dollars 2.8bn, up 20 per cent, while net revenue outside the
US was Dollars 3.3bn, a 24 per cent increase over last year's third quarter.
Earnings were in line with Wall Street expectations. However, the company's
exceptionally strong growth in orders booked during the third quarter
excited investors, and HP's share price jumped Dollars 8 1/2 to close at
Dollars 87 5/8 in New York.
HP said orders booked during the third quarter totalled Dollars 6bn, an
increase of 27 per cent over the same period last year. US orders rose 24
per cent to Dollars 2.8bn while orders from outside the US increased 29 per
cent to Dollars 3.2bn.
In HP's core computer business, revenues were up 20 per cent at Dollars
4.7bn for the quarter. Orders jumped 28 per cent to Dollars 4.6bn. The
company said orders for PC and network servers were 'outstanding', with
growth substantially outpacing the market rate.
HP's flagship PC printers continued to sell strongly in the quarter and the
company said it saw an 'excellent increase in orders' for its popular
Deskjet models.
For the nine months ended July 31, net revenue increased to Dollars 18bn
from Dollars 14.6bn while net earnings grew 28 per cent to Dollars 1.1bn.
Net earnings per share were Dollars 4.31, up from Dollars 3.47 in the first
nine months of fiscal 1993.

FT  17 AUG 94 / International Company News: De Beers earnings slip 5% to
Dollars 460m at six-month stage

<TEXT>
De Beers, the South African company that dominates the world diamond
industry, recorded a 5 per cent drop in earnings to Dollars 460m for the
first six months of 1994, down from Dollars 482m a year ago.
However, in rand terms earnings rose slightly to R1.61bn (Dollars 449m) from
R1.54bn due to the decline in the rand/dollar exchange rate.
Income before tax, at Dollars 447m, was almost identical to last year's
figure of Dollars 444m, but higher taxes of Dollars 101m, up from Dollars
86m, pushed the results down. The dividend was maintained at 25.4 US cents a
share.
The company's balance sheet was slightly stronger. Diamond stocks fell to
Dollars 4.03bn from Dollars 4.12bn reflecting an improvement in sales.
Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman, warned that, like last year, sales for
the second half will be substantially below those for the first half,
although he declined to estimate what the final sales figure would be.
He also noted that the Central Selling Organisation, the company's marketing
arm, would be reducing its level of recent and current sights (sales to the
trade). However, he added that jewellery sales were continuing at the
improved levels of 1993 and the overall picture should continue to improve
now that the global recession had ended.
Although Japanese sales were down 11 per cent in yen terms, the drop was
mainly at the cheap end of the market and had been partly offset by a 10 per
cent rise in sales in the rest of east Asia.
In spite of the improved outlook, Mr Ogilvie Thompson noted that there had
been a deterioration in confidence in the cutting centres. This was largely
because of concerns over profitability, a problem which had been exacerbated
by the continued large quantities of Russian rough diamonds being sold on to
the market outside the CSO.
On the question of the company's negotiations with the Russian government on
sales from its diamond stockpile, Mr Ogilvie Thompson said the talks were
progressing on a 'sound footing'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Norcen Energy Resources, a Canadian oil and gas group, said it would bid
CDollars 13.25 per share for the 47.6 per cent stake in North Canadian Oils
that it does not already own, Reuter reports from Calgary. The total
purchase price would be CDollars 233.83m (USDollars 169m).
Norcen now owns about 19.42m shares of North Canadian, or 52.4 per cent of
the company's outstanding shares.
The bid is conditional on Norcen receiving at least 90 per cent of the North
Canadian shares it does not already own, the company said.
Trading in North Canadian shares was halted yesterday with the price
standing at CDollars 10.75.
The purchase of the remaining shares would be financed by a line of credit
arranged with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and existing credit
lines, Norcen said.
The debt incurred in the purchase is intended to be retired during the next
12 months from proceeds of sales of non-core assets which are planned or
under way, the company said.
'The offer will provide a significant premium over recent North Canadian
market prices and, we believe, fairly reflects underlying asset values,'
said Mr Edward Battle, Norcen chairman.
The company said that it has retained the services of RBC Dominion
Securities for advice and to form a group to solicit acceptances of the
offer.
Norcen purchased its 52.4 per cent stake in North Canadian in 1993, and has
amalgamated the oil and natural gas pro-ducing operations of North Canadian
into its own operations.

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Australia's largest food processor, Goodman Fielder, said its chairman, Mr
John Studdy, would stand down once an external successor is found and that
two additional non-executive directors would be appointed, Reuter reports
from Sydney.
The company's future has been under a cloud recently after a revolt by
shareholders, led by Melbourne businessman Mr Doug Shears, whose company
Agrifood Australia owns 3.5 per cent of the stock.
'While Mr Studdy has the full support of the board, he recognises the need
for a succession plan and the appointment in due course of an external
successor,' Goodman said.
'The chairman has indicated a desire and a willingness to stand down, when a
successor has been found. This transition will ensure the stability of the
board and will allow the board to continue its process of change.'
Mr Shears had rallied three groups of institutional investors with a
combined shareholding of just under 16 per cent to his side, and called for
a shake-up in the Goodman boardroom.
Goodman has recorded flat profits for the past five years, resulting in its
share price remaining little changed over the same period and making the
company a regular subject of takeover talk.
Mr Shears has carried on a battle with the Goodman board for nearly two
years since his privately-owned food group sold the Uncle Toby's breakfast
cereals business to Goodman in exchange for Goodman shares and a board seat.
However, Goodman later refused Mr Shears admission to the board following
disagreements with the management at the time.
Goodman posted a net profit of ADollars 182m (USDollars 135m) on sales of
ADollars 4bn in the year to June 1993.
Analysts expect the company to report a slightly poorer performance in the
1993-94 year. Goodman shares closed 4 cents lower at ADollars 1.34
yesterday.

<TEXT>
Thinking Machines, the company that pioneered the use of massively parallel
processing (MPP) technology to build high performance supercomputers, has
filed for court protection under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code.
The Massachusetts company announced it has made about one-third of its 425
employees redundant and plans to reorganise, 'to support the company's
existing customer base and aggressively market its technology through
licences to other companies'.
Founded in 1983, Thinking Machines originated the idea of massively parallel
computing; linking thousands of inexpensive microprocessor chips to build a
powerful supercomputer.
The approach, which involves breaking down big computing problems into
millions of discrete elements and solving them simultaneously, has
transformed supercomputing technology.
'Together with our customers, we have opened a new frontier in computing. I
am sad we have not been able to turn our technical successes into financial
success,' said Mr Danny Hillis, co-founder and chief scientist at Thinking
Machines.
Like other companies in the supercomputer market, Thinking Machines has been
hard hit by cuts in US defence spending. Competition from larger companies,
in particular IBM and Intel, has also taken its toll.
Thinking Machines is not alone among MPP companies in facing financial
problems. Cray Computer, a spin-off from Cray Research, has yet to sell a
computer and has acknowledged that it faces a cash crisis.
Kendall Square Research is also struggling after an accounting debacle in
which it overstated sales. Earlier this month the company laid off 80
people.

Shinawatra Computer and Communications, the Thai telecoms and computer
group, has almost doubled net profits of Bt1.21bn (Dollars 48.3m) for the
first half, compared with Bt632m the same period last year.
The buoyant figures were helped by a sharp rise in net profits to Bt784m at
its mobile phone subsidiary, Advanced Information Services, compared with
Bt384m last time.
Accounting adjustments have muddied the parent company's half-year advance,
but brokers HG Asia reckon its forecast of Bt2.63bn net for the full year is
achievable. The parent company's second-quarter net profits jumped to
Bt400.4m from Bt231m; Advanced's second quarter rose from Bt384.7m to
Bt784m.
Shinawatra Computer has placed 20 per cent of its previously wholly-owned
overseas investment arm, Shinawatra International, with 15 strategic
partners, giving the company an Bt840m after-tax gain. A further 20 per cent
of Shinawatra International is due to be offered to the public.
Shinawatra Satellite, which was set up last year, made a loss of Bt16.2m.

FT  17 AUG 94 / International Company News: Newsprint buyers set to resist
price rise
</HEADLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Champion International, the Connecticut-based forestry group, has caught
North American publishers off-guard by announcing its third newsprint price
increase this year.
Buyers indicated that they would vigorously resist the latest increase. Low
newsprint prices played a significant part in cushioning publishers from the
full impact of the 1991-93 recession, and few have budgeted for another
increase this year.
Champion's move, which takes the form of a 5 per cent cut in discounts on
the Dollars 685 per tonne list price effective from December 1, is expected
to be followed shortly by other US and Canadian producers.
One industry expert said that some Canadian companies were considering even
bigger increases.
The latest discount cut would bring newsprint prices to Dollars 534.3 a
tonne, compared with less than Dollars 420 at the beginning of this year.
Champion started implementing its previous 6 per cent discount cut earlier
this week.
'Our sense is that demand worldwide is increasing,' Champion said yesterday.
According to the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, US newsprint
consumption rose by 2.4 per cent in the first half of 1994, and consumer
inventories were 24 per cent lower at the end of June than a year earlier.
Demand outside North America has been even stronger. Canadian exports to
overseas markets, mainly the UK and east Asia, soared by 44 per cent in
June.
Pulp and paper prices have turned round much faster than most
market-watchers expected. The latest newsprint increase will coincide with
the peak pre-Christmas consumption period.
Furthermore, there could be a scramble for supplies if labour-contract talks
under way at British Columbia's pulp and paper mills break down, leading to
a strike.

<TEXT>
Hasbro, the US toys and games group, is reorganising and merging all its US
toy operations into a single entity, US Toy Group, effective immediately,
AP-DJ reports from Pawtucket.
Mr John O'Neill, chief financial officer, said that the company expected to
take a third-quarter pre-tax charge of between Dollars 10m and Dollars 12m
as a result of the changes.
Under the reorganisation, the Hasbro name will no longer be used as a brand
name for specific products, but reserved for corporate use only.
In last year's third quarter, ended September 26 1993, the company reported
net income of Dollars 75.55m, or 84 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 812m.
Hasbro said the reorganisation would result in the loss of about 100 jobs,
or about 9 per cent of its domestic toy work force. It has a total US work
force of about 7,600.
The reorganisation will merge Playskool, Playskool Baby, Hasbro Toy, Kid
Dimension and Kenner.
The group will report to Mr Alfred Verrecchia, chief operating officer of
all domestic toy operations. Mr Dan Owen, currently president of the
Play-skool division, will be president of the US Toy Group.
The company said the reorganisation would allow it to bring new products to
market more quickly and 'to become even closer partners with our retailers'.
The games segment of Hasbro's US operations, consisting of Milton Bradley
and Kenner Parker, is not affected.

The company's Muang Tong Thani new town on the outskirts on Bangkok has been

Bunnings, the Australian timber, hardware and building materials group,
yesterday reported a 63 per cent rise in after-tax profits to ADollars 30.8m
(USDollars 22.8m) for the year to June, writes Emilia Tagaza in Melbourne.
Earnings before interest, tax and abnormals increased by 77 per cent to
ADollars 53.4m.
The earnings were struck on record sales of ADollars 370m, which were 41 per
cent higher than the previous year's ADollars 213m.
The Perth-based company reported improvements in all operations,
particularly in timber and building products. However, it expects a slight
downturn in the 1995 figures, as it is restructuring its hardware operations
and expects a downturn in Australian home building.
It has declared a final dividend of 21 cents a share, fully-franked,
bringing the full year's dividend to 40 cents.

Sales rose 14.6 per cent to Won4,051bn.
Analysts believe the profit growth mainly reflected a recent change in
accounting rules to reduce special depreciation charges. These charges
depressed earnings last year.
Kepco is the largest company listed on the Seoul bourse, accounting for
about 13 per cent of market capitalisation.

FT  17 AUG 94 / International Company News: Lac suitors seek to suspend
'poison pill'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The two gold producers bidding for Toronto-based Lac Minerals will ask the
Ontario Securities Commission tomorrow to dissolve a 'poison pill' which Lac
has put in place to discourage predators.
American Barrick and Royal Oak Mines are expected to argue that the poison
pill was designed to give Lac's directors time to find better offers, but
that it now deprives shareholders of the ability to choose between competing
bids.
Lac's directors have rejected both bids, saying shareholders would be best
served if the company remained independent. Lac is expected to oppose the
application to suspend its poison pill.
Royal Oak's CDollars 2.4bn (USDollars 1.73bn) offer, comprising cash and
shares, is due to expire on Friday. American Barrick's bid is worth about
CDollars 2.1bn, but is widely considered to be more attractive because its
paper is more desirable and more liquid. Royal Oak is by far the smaller
company and its mines are relatively high-cost operations.
The Barrick offer expires on August 26. Barrick will ask the Commission to
allow both bids to expire at the same time 'so investors will have a
meaningful choice between them'.
Lac, which is widely owned, put a 'shareholder rights plan' in place in
1991. The poison pill would be triggered if any outsider acquired more than
15 per cent of Lac's shares. The directors would be able to thwart a full
takeover by issuing shares at a substantial discount to existing
shareholders.
Barrick's lawyers said in a letter to the commission that Lac has had 'ample
time' to seek alternative offers since Royal Oak unveiled its first bid on
July 7.
'The defensive wall created by the rights plan is beginning to operate to
the detriment of Lac shareholders by denying them access to the outstanding
offers,' the letter said. 'Any suggestion that the rights plan be kept in
place in order to enforce the so-called 'stand-alone option' would be
abhorrent to investors.'
Mr John Palmer, senior partner in the Toronto accounting firm of KPMG Peat

<TEXT>
Wolters Kluwer, the Dutch publisher, posted a 22 per cent increase in
first-half net profit and predicted a rise of about 20 per cent for 1994 as
a whole.
The first-half increase, in line with a full-year 1993 rise of 23 per cent,
took net profit to Fl 169m (Dollars 97m) compared with Fl 138m in the first
six months of last year.
Sales were up 1.8 per cent to Fl 1.28bn, mainly reflecting divestments of
non-core activities.
Wolters Kluwer said it saw strong growth in international scientific
publishing and in legal and tax publishing in Europe. The group said growth
was satisfactory in business publishing, US medical publishing and Dutch
educational publishing.
The company expects further acquisitions this year to add to those in
Austria, Hungary and the Czech Republic.
The group is to concentrate on countries in Europe which are eager to join
the European Union and where there is demand for detailed information about
Europe from tax and legal professionals.
Hunter Douglas, the Dutch-based manufacturer of window coverings and
architectural products, reported a 35.7 per cent increase in first-half net
profit, reflecting strong results in the US and Australia.
Net profit rose to Fl 36.5m (Dollars 20.9m) from Fl 26.9m in the first six
months of 1993. Turnover was up 14.3 per cent at Fl 970.5m, helped by an
11.6 per cent increase in the volume of sales.

FT  17 AUG 94 / International Company News: Swiss Bank Corp falls to
SFr1.19bn in first half - Operating income hit by bond trading business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
Swiss Bank Corporation, Switzerland's third largest bank, reported a 45.1
per cent drop in consolidated profits before taxes and provisions in the
first half to SFr1.19bn (Dollars 869m). This is a worse performance than its
two local rivals, Union Bank of Switzerland and Credit Suisse.
A collapse in income from trading in bonds and interest rate instruments was
the main cause of a 23 per cent fall in operating income to SFr3.38bn, while
operating costs were flat at SFr2.19bn.
Citing an improvement in economic conditions and in borrower quality, SBC
halved its bad debt provisions to SFr585m. Together with a 29 per cent cut
in income taxes, this limited the fall in net income, which was SFr438m, to
36 per cent.
SBC said the results were below expectations, but said it was 'cautiously
optimistic about the outlook for the second half, which will largely depend
on how the financial markets develop'.
The bank, which has put large resources into developing a sophisticated
trading business in recent years, suffered a 63 per cent fall in income from
this volatile area to SFr537m. It said profits on foreign exchange and
European equity trading were ahead of expectations, but results from trading
in bonds and interest rate instruments suffered.
While the SBC trading result was slightly less dismal than the 68 per cent
fall in trading income at UBS, it was far worse than the 35 per cent drop at
Credit Suisse.
Also, UBS was better able than SBC to cushion the big drop in its trading
income from its lending and commission businesses.
SBC net interest income was down 15 per cent to SFr1.37bn because of
'continuing pressure on margins' and commission income was up 11 per cent to
SFr1.34bn. UBS net interest income was down 8 per cent to SFr1.78bn and its
commission income up 10.8 per cent to SFr2.14bn.
While UBS knocked operating costs down by about SFr77m to SFr2.6bn, SBC's
costs fell by only SFr13m to SFr2.18bn. SBC said the 9.7 per cent rise in
overheads reflected branch network restructuring and an expansion of its
international activities.
SBC led the big three in cutting personnel costs, indicating the increasing
proportion of compensation that is performance related.
SBC staff costs were down 6 per cent to SFr1.4bn, while those at UBS were
down 4.4 per cent to SFr1.85bn. The Credit Suisse personnel bill was up 6
per cent to SFr1.46bn.
SBC's 53 per cent reduction in bad loan provisions was much more aggressive
than the 26.4 per cent cut at UBS. Credit Suisse did not publish a figure
for first-half provisions, but the reduction was probably large. The bank,
whose profit before taxes and provisions was down 27 per cent to SFr1.75bn,
said its net income was only slightly down.

FT  17 AUG 94 / International Company News: Shareholders force Kmart to
float units
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kmart, the troubled US discount store group, yesterday yielded to pressure
from rebellious institutional investors and announced plans to float off
three of its four specialty retailing subsidiaries on the stock market.
The three companies to be divested are OfficeMax, a chain of office supplies
superstores; The Sports Authority, a chain of sporting goods superstores;
and Borders/Walden, comprising the Borders book superstores and Waldenbooks
book shops.
The group's fourth specialty retailing operation, Builders Square, is not
considered a candidate for flotation because it does not make a profit.
Kmart said the company would stay within the parent group until its future
had been decided.
Kmart has been forced into the divestment by its shareholders' rejection of
an earlier plan to create classes of Kmart shares tied to the performance of
the specialty retailers. Kmart had hoped to raise Dollars 600m-Dollars 900m
by selling 20 per cent to 30 per cent of these shares without relinquishing
control of the subsidiaries.
Institutional investors threw out the proposal at the beginning of June
because they believed Kmart should sell the specialty retailers outright and
devote its energies to revitalising the ailing discount stores, which have
been losing customers to Kmart's bigger and more successful rival, Wal-Mart
Stores.
Under the new plan, Kmart will sell at least 51 per cent of its shares in
three of the specialty retailers through initial public offerings, so
yielding control of the companies. An initial public offering of shares in
OfficeMax will take place in the next few weeks.
Kmart said it was confident the revised plan would win shareholders'
approval because it had discussed it with institutional investors. The plan
would leave the door open to an orderly disposal of Kmart's remaining stakes
in the businesses in due course.
The new plan marks the second about-turn by Kmart in less than three weeks.
Late last month, it said it planned to sell its 21.5 per cent stake in
Coles-Myer, the Australian retailer, for ADollars 1.26bn (USDollars 926m),
having earlier rejected speculation that a sale was imminent.
Meanwhile shareholders still await a promised announcement from Kmart about
how it intends to restore profitable growth to its core discount store
operations.
On Monday it reported that losses on continuing operations had widened by 25
per cent to Dollars 94m in the second quarter to July.

FT  17 AUG 94 / International Company News: Lac suitors seek to have 'poison
pill' takeover defence dissolved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The two gold producers bidding for Toronto-based Lac Minerals will ask the
Ontario Securities Commission tomorrow to dissolve a 'poison pill' which Lac
has put in place to discourage predators.
American Barrick and Royal Oak Mines are expected to argue that the poison
pill was designed to give Lac's directors time to find better offers, but
that it now deprives shareholders of the ability to choose between competing
bids.
Lac's directors have rejected both bids, saying shareholders would be best
served if the company remained independent. Lac is expected to oppose the
application to suspend its poison pill.
Royal Oak's CDollars 2.4bn (USDollars 1.73bn) offer, comprising cash and
shares, is due to expire on Friday.
American Barrick's bid is worth about CDollars 2.1bn, but is widely
considered to be more attractive because its paper is more desirable and
more liquid. Royal Oak is by far the smaller company and its mines are
relatively high-cost operations.
The Barrick offer expires on August 26. Barrick will ask the Commission to
allow both bids to expire at the same time 'so investors will have a
meaningful choice between them'.
Lac, which is widely owned, put a 'shareholder rights plan' in place in
1991. The poison pill would be triggered if any outsider acquired more than
15 per cent of Lac's shares.
The directors would be able to thwart a full takeover by issuing shares at a
substantial discount to existing shareholders.
Barrick's lawyers said in a letter to the commission that Lac has had 'ample
time' to seek alternative offers since Royal Oak unveiled its first bid on
July 7.

<TEXT>
Den norske Bank, Norway's largest bank, recorded its biggest half-year
profit in the first six months of this year, helped by the reversal of a
long trend of heavy loan-loss provisions.
DnB, state-controlled since it was bailed out of a loan-loss crisis by the
government in 1992, reported a pre-tax profit of NKr1.48bn (Dollars 208m)
compared with a surplus of NKr218m in the same period of the previous year.
The result was achieved in spite of lower interest income and a fall in
profits from its bond and share portfolio.
The most striking feature of the result was a net gain of NKr124m made under
loan losses, as amounts written back on previous loan losses exceeded new
provisions. At the same stage last year, DnB made net provisions of
NKr1.99bn.
The turnround followed a similar gain by Christiania Bank, Norway's second
largest bank, and provides evidence that the strengthening Norwegian economy
is bolstering the recovery of the banks from the crisis of the early 1990s,
when most of them come under state control.
'We are pleased that in such a short time the Norwegian business sector has
improved its position more than anyone envisaged just a year ago,' said Mr
Finn Hvistendahl, DnB's chief executive.
'This has enhanced the quality of our loan portfolio and made it possible to
reverse a small portion of previous loan-loss provisions,' he said.
The volume of non-performing loans was cut at the half-way stage to NKr8.4bn
from NKr10.2bn at the end of 1993.
However, DnB, formed in 1990 from the merger of Den norske Creditbank and
Bergen Bank, said operating profits before write-downs fell sharply to
NKr1.35bn from NKr2.26bn in the same period last year.
Net interest income fell in the first half to NKr2.44bn from NKr2.64bn.
Other income slipped to NKr1.2bn from NKr1.87bn as the interest rate
turbulence of the past few months sent bond trading profits spinning down to
NKr71m from NKr666m and share profits fell to NKr87m from NKr189m.

FT  17 AUG 94 / International Company News: Philips, KPN join Graff in
pay-TV venture
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Philips, the Dutch electronics group, and KPN, the Netherlands'
recently-privatised telecommunications operator, are to enter the European
pay-television market in a joint venture with Graff Pay-Per-View, a US
company.
The three companies plan to start services in pay-per-view television to
European cable operators in September.
Pay-per-view, which allows viewers to choose programmes and pay only for
what they see, is seen as the next advance for Europe's cable operators, and
for telecommunications operators seeking a move into entertainment. All the
main operators are conducting trials, aiming to offer a full video-on-demand
service.
Analysts said the Philips-led joint venture would have more impact on the
Dutch market with its 95 per cent cable penetration. But this is mostly
narrow-band capacity without advanced inter-active services.
In the other main European markets, the venture faces strong competition
from established operators and programming providers.
Mr Neil Blackley, media analyst at Goldman Sachs, said Graff, one of the
largest US providers, appeared to have failed to establish itself as a prime
pay-per-view provider in the UK, where satellite and cable operators are
expected to contract directly with programming providers.
Philips, eager to bolster its 'new media' presence, will own 45 per cent of
the venture, with KPN holding 35 per cent and Graff the remaining 20 per
cent.
The companies declined to give financial details, but KPN said its share
would run into tens of millions of guilders.
Graff, which operates 11 channels of pay-per-view television in the US and
delivers programmes to cable operators with a combined audience of more than
10m subscribers, said: 'We are confident the new company represents the
perfect alliance to respond to the needs of European consumers for new media
services.'
Graff will bring to the venture its experience in buying and licensing
programming from Hollywood and the rest of the US entertainment industry.
Philips owns stakes in the infrastructure of cable television networks in
the Netherlands, Austria, France and Belgium.
The three companies said that a number of European cable operators had
already expressed interest in working with the joint venture.
KPN, which was partially floated on the Amsterdam bourse in June, has a 76
per cent stake in Casema, a Dutch cable operator with 1.2m subscribers.
Casema is planning to start pay-TV and pay-per-view in and around The Hague
and Utrecht in early 1995, as part of a partnership with the new joint
venture.
The potential 400,000 subscribers in these two Dutch cities would be offered
several pay-per-view channels, with viewers paying per film or per event, as
well as several pay-TV channels in return for a monthly subscription charge.

FT  17 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Harrington pay-out cut after new audit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Harrington Kilbride, the magazine publisher, yesterday revoked its proposal
to pay a 3.2p final dividend for the year to December 31 1993, and instead
recommended a final pay-out of 1p to make a total of 2.7p, a 40 per cent
reduction on 1992's 4.5p total.
The dividend cut followed the publication of the group's re-audited accounts
for 1993, which in turn was necessitated by changes to the provisions
Harrington made for bad and doubtful debts.
In early June it made late extra provisions of Pounds 3m after the accounts
had been announced; this turned pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.42m into losses
and the shares fell 66p to 68p in a day.
Yesterday a further Pounds 500,000 was added to the provision; this resulted
in previously announced operating profits of Pounds 2.68m being restated as
losses of Pounds 824,000. Pre-tax losses totalled Pounds 1.08m, against
profits of Pounds 1.87m in 1992. At December, debtors still owed the company
Pounds 1.36m.
Bonuses which would have been paid to Mr Kevin Harrington and Mr Kevin
Austin, managing and finance directors respectively, will not now be paid.
Harrington, whose shares on September 7 last peaked at 252p and yesterday
closed down 1p at 42p, publishes a wide range of magazines, many of which
are free. These make their money by the sale of advertising space.
Expansion in Eastern Europe and the CIS lay behind much of the provisions,
but the company will now concentrate on conferences on a cash receipts
basis.
Turnover in 1993 was Pounds 23.8m (Pounds 15.4m) and losses per share were
11.4p (earnings 11.8p).

FT  17 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Rising car sales help Evans Halshaw to
Pounds 7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Evans Halshaw, the West Midlands-based motor distributor, almost doubled
first half profits as it increased car sales sharply, sustained its
after-market business and pushed operating margins to a five year peak.
In the six months to June 30, pre-tax profits rose 85 per cent to Pounds
6.91m (Pounds 3.73m), producing earnings per share of 19.6p, against 11.3p.
The group declared the interim dividend of 5p (3.8p) promised last June when
it announced a recommended offer of Pounds 32.6m for Davenport Vernon and
went to the market to raise Pounds 29m with a 3-for-10 rights issue.
Yesterday it restated its intention that 'the interim should represent
approximately one third of the total dividend for the year'. Last year a
total of 13p was paid.
Turnover increased 43 per cent to Pounds 270.9m (Pounds 189m) boosted by the
1993 takeover of the TK Group, which contributed 12 percentage points of the
rise.
The Davenport takeover and the purchase of the smaller GT Cars came too late
to affect the first half figures.
Mr Geoffrey Dale, chairman, said the acquisitions had doubled the size of
the group and it would now be concentrating on developing the enlarged
company.
Operating profits climbed to Pounds 8.37m (Pounds 4.99m), helped by a 40 per
cent increase in the sales of both new and used cars to a total of 23,000
units.
The increase shifted the balance of the group's business. Car sales
accounted for 39 per cent of turnover, compared with 31 per cent in the 1993
first half, while the staple source of revenue, servicing and parts sales,
fell from 62 per cent to 54 per cent.
Car sales have continued strongly. Mr Dale said that for August, the first
month of the new registration year, it had been 'seeing an increase in new
car sales of over 10 per cent on a comparable basis to last year'. The
national increase for the first 10 days of the month was 3.7 per cent.
Operating margins rose to 3.1 per cent, the first time the figure has been
above 3 per cent since 1989, compared with 2.6 per cent for 1993 and 1.6 per
cent for 1992.

FT  17 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Brymon's passengers to exceed 400,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brymon Airways, the Plymouth-based regional airline rescued by British
Airways in August last year, said yesterday it expected passenger numbers to
be up by a third this year to over 400,000.
Mr Mike Jones, managing director, said: 'In July Brymon flew 37,000
scheduled passengers at an average load factor of 70 per cent, remarkable
figures for short-haul domestic operations, and a record'.
Brymon flies to 10 destinations, including Paris and Frankfurt. from its hub
airport at Bristol.
Mr Jones acknowledged the airline had had a reputation for unreliability but
said, since January, it had met or exceeded punctuality targets.
British Airways, which had held 40 per cent of Brymon since 1985, took over
the whole of the lossmaking airline last year and markets its services under
a franchise arrangement.
The airline said it was now trading well above budget. 'What we are proving
is that BA can operate at a local level, providing the cost and operational
structure can be kept in line with the type of service provided,' Mr Jones
said. 'Brymon as BA is doing a whole lot better than Brymon as Brymon
Airways.'
He said the airline was seeking slots at Manchester and Dusseldorf airports
for services from Bristol. It also planned to improve its operations from
Heathrow to Plymouth and Newquay. It intends to examine the possibility of
using Heathrow's crosswind runway to give extra capacity, using a special
access landing system pioneered in the US.

FT  17 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Robert Lowe back in black
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Robert H Lowe, the clothing, printing and packaging company, returned to the
black with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 305,000 for the six months to April
30, compared with a loss of Pounds 1.28m.
The group, which raised Pounds 3m via a placing and open offer in July, saw
turnover increase 37 per cent to Pounds 5.59m, although Mr David Sebire,
chairman, said that results were flattered because sales to certain
customers were brought forward 'compared with normal experience'.
He warned that this meant the full-year figures were unlikely to increase
proportionately, despite the second half traditionally being better than the
first.
The placing and offer reduced borrowings by Pounds 2.5m, bringing gearing to
'an acceptable level'.
Earnings per share were 0.67p (losses 2.83p).

FT  17 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Pulling together the Asia-Pacific region -
Co-ordination is key for Rolls-Royce's new regional director
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the most important recent developments in the way UK engineering
companies approach the Asian market has been the appointment of top
executives with group responsibility for the region or a large part of it.
A classic example - mirrored in the two companies already covered in this
series - was Rolls-Royce's appointment of Mr Timothy Jones as regional
director, south-east Asia, about 18 months ago.
Mr Jones spent a year in London 'selling' his job internally to
Rolls-Royce's aero-engine and industrial businesses, before moving to
Singapore in February.
'I'm here to take a corporate standpoint on regional activity,' he says. 'It
was a conscious decision to co-ordinate things better, and to get leverage
between the different parts of the business.'
Mr Jones' region covers 10 countries from Burma to the Philippines and
Brunei. Rolls-Royce already has regional executives, with offices in
Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta and Singapore, reinforced by sales directors
for the specific sales businesses, and project development teams which come
out from London. In an era when companies are more likely to remove levels
of management, it is a measure of the importance Rolls-Royce attaches to the
region that Mr Jones has been 'superimposed' on this structure to pull
things together.
The Asia-Pacific region already accounts for 25 per cent of Rolls-Royce's
Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.4bn) order book. Mr Jones says he would not be
surprised if that percentage rises, just as he hopes the total will increase
in real terms too. 'I would be bitterly disappointed if the region's share
falls,' he says.
The aerospace side accounts for 55 to 60 per cent of business in the region,
but the aim is to achieve an even balance between aerospace and the
industrial businesses. Mr Jones points to a number of steps already taken
beyond the region, which should help the company's prospects in the power
generation market there.
Restructuring at Parsons, Rolls-Royce's flagship power equipment company,
has turned it into a turnkey supplier, he says, while Rolls-Royce's
wide-ranging co-operation agreement with Westinghouse Electric of the US has
given it a broader appeal than it could have achieved on its own, as it did
not have the product range.
With Rolls-Royce's aero-derived engines and access to the heavy-duty
Westinghouse gas turbine range, Rolls-Royce and Parsons can look beyond the
medium-sized power stations that have been its traditional strength.
In July, Parsons won its first turnkey power station order in Indonesia  - a
Dollars 90m order for a 60MW station in East Kalimantan. The deal covered
all the electromechanical equipment, including two RB211 gas
turbine-generating sets, and the civil works.
At the larger end of the business, building a 1,000MW station was a
possibility, but was a huge effort before the link-up with Westinghouse,
says Mr Jones. Even so, Rolls-Royce's approach to the region will remain
discriminating: 'It would be wrong to target a whole spectrum of activities
and go into all sorts of build-own-operate and other projects because we
don't have the size,' he says.
As a consequence of his position, Mr Jones says he cannot view one part of
Rolls-Royce's business in isolation, and especially wants to transfer to the
industrial power business the experience gained from the risk- and
revenue-sharing agreements made in the aero-engine business over the past 10
years.
'It makes perfect sense for me to come to this region from London, look at
what are the best ways of forging ahead and achieving better business in the
future, and what is the logical way to co-operate with local industry,' he
says.
One such venture, announced in February, has not exactly proceeded to plan.
Rolls-Royce has formed a joint venture with EPE Power to meet the growing
demand for power transmission equipment in Malaysia; a few days later, the
Malaysian government announced its ban on UK companies winning public
contracts.
Mr Jones says: 'It's difficult to make progress on a venture designed to
tackle government projects when there's a ban on doing business with
government agencies. But as soon as the ban comes off, hopefully we can get
on with the job we set out to do.'
He stresses, though, that the ban is not a total trade embargo. There has
been no noticeable effect on private-sector business, and Rolls-Royce is
still discussing potential projects with independent power producers. 'We
are still talking at all levels,' he says. 'We're just not able to do things
while there's a ban in place.'
Malaysia is also Rolls-Royce's best chance in an area where Mr Jones
believes it is well-placed for new orders - refurbishing power stations. A
Pounds 70m project to convert the Connaught Bridge power station near Kuala
Lumpur to more efficient combined-cycle operation was completed last
September.
Elsewhere in the region he sees plenty of potential, though some of it, such
as in Laos and Cambodia, offers less immediate prospects. In Burma, Mr Jones
hopes to build on the links generated from being a long-term supplier of
aero-engines to break into the power business, possibly in some form of
partnership.
In Thailand, Rolls-Royce is exploring a number of projects in various
businesses, while in Indonesia, another country where it has been successful
selling aero-engines, Mr Jones sees opportunities 'right across the
spectrum'.
The latest power station deal, he hopes, will lead to more in Indonesia.
There are opportunities for the Cooper-Rolls joint venture, which produces
power units for the oil and gas industry, while Rolls-Royce's cranes and
materials handling equipment businesses stand to benefit from port
development work.

FT  17 AUG 94 / International Company News: US side behind growth in Irish
Life premium income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US growth continued to be the main driving force behind increased premium
sales at Irish Life, which reported a 5.8 per cent rise in total premium
income to IPounds 360.1m (Pounds 355m) for the six months to June 30,
against IPounds 340.2m.
Premium income at Interstate, the Dublin-based assurance company's US
subsidiary, increased by 36 per cent from IPounds 62.3m to IPounds 84.8m.
Even stronger growth in the second half is anticipated following completion
next month of a Dollars 51.1m acquisition of the Boston-based First Variable
Life, which is licensed to sell unit-linked products throughout the US.
Group revenue growth has remained static, however, because of a 12 per cent
fall in investment income to IPounds 135.6m (Pounds 154.6m), primarily due
to a lower short-term interest rate environment compared with the 1993 first
half.
The present period's figures do not include David, its Norwegian business
sold for IPounds 12m in May.
New recurring premium business in the core Irish activities grew by 11 per
cent from IPounds 26m to IPounds 28.8m, taking the total to IPounds 144.8m
(IPounds 141.8m). The upturn is seen as important, as this sector has been
facing intense competition in recent years by new entrants to the market and
attractive tax-based investment alternatives.
Single premium sales were up by a more modest 6 per cent to IPounds 64.5m
(IPounds 60.7m). Sales of individual investment products were 'particularly
buoyant', rising 38 per cent to IPounds 44.6m.
Total new business in the UK fell by 37 per cent to IPounds 13.2m (IPounds
21m), a trend which is expected to continue into the second half as the
company scales back its appointed representative distribution network.
The company said that 'good progress' had been made in its cost reduction
programme in Ireland, which is expected to be complete by the end of the
year. Management expenses were down by IPounds 2.2m to IPounds 45m in the
first half.
As a valuation is not carried out at the interim stage, the company's policy
is to maintain an unchanged interim dividend at 3p.
Brokers, however, anticipate an 8 per cent dividend increase for the full
year, and 6 per cent growth in embedded value to IPounds 590m.

FT  17 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Scantronic shares dip 25%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Scantronic Holdings fell 25 per cent yesterday after the security
components manufacturer and distributor announced a deeply-discounted share
offer to stave off substantial cash flow difficulties.
The shares closed 6 1/2 p lower at 20p after the company announced the
Pounds 1.6m share offer, which accompanied a statement that it would incur a
loss for the first half of the current year.
The open offer of 16.1m new shares is being launched at 10p a share, and was
required before Barclays, its bankers, would extend further loans to tide
the company over the peak manufacturing period. It is understood that the
company may have breached existing banking covenants.
Scantronic, whose shares have fallen from a 1994 high of 89p, has been
saddled with increasing debt from acquisitions, and had Pounds 11.2m debt at
the end of June, up from Pounds 3.5m in March 1993.
Profits have been hampered by legal actions related to some of the
acquisitions. In addition, sales have been hit by recession in Europe, and
UK profits faltered during April and May.
However, the company is confident that after taking a number of one-off
costs in the first half of the year, it would 'see a steady return to normal
trading,' and reap the benefits from substantial investment in new products.
The company also announ-ced pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.89m (Pounds 1.27m)
for the year to March 31. This compared with a statement on July 25 that it
would make profits of at least Pounds 2.75m. However, the difference was
accounted for by a change in accounting policy, under which research and
development costs are no longer capitalised.
Turnover rose from Pounds 39.1m to Pounds 50.2m, but the core UK
manufacturing business saw operating profits fall from Pounds 3.3m to Pounds
2.59m, primarily due to lower sales to Europe. UK sales, however, continued
to rise.
In the first half of next year, the company will take on substantial costs
related to its financial reorganisation - it incurred a Pounds 240,000
deficit from the sale of Gardiner Group loan stock to meet financing
requirements - which will result in a loss.
The company has replaced the finance director following its latest
difficulties, and may face compensation claims, which could further affect
profits.
The final dividend is passed - the 0.843p interim compares with a previous
3.121p total. Losses per share were 0.46p (0.88p).

FT  17 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Pifco considers enfranchising A shares in
expansion plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REG VAUGHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pifco Holdings, the household appliances manufacturer, yesterday indicated
the possible enfranchisement of its 6.92m A shares with the resultant loss
of family control, in place since the company's creation at the turn of the
century.
The move was announced as the Manchester-based company reported increased
pre-tax profits, earnings per share and dividend for the year to end-April.
The shares rose 10p to 358p.
Mr Michael Webber, chairman and a relative of the company's founder, said
the A shares, at present entitled to one quarter of a vote, would be
enfranchised at the same time as a rights issue to fund an acquisition.
He said yesterday that the company was continuing its search for expansion
in mainland Europe and that an acquisition was 'in the works'. The company
was in discussion with a number of European-based groups.
The company, best known for its Russell Hobbs, Carmen and Tower household
products, lifted profits by 21 per cent to Pounds 2.65m (Pounds 2.2m) on
turnover marginally lower at Pounds 36.8m (Pounds 37.4m).
Operating margins rose from 5.5 per cent to 6.8 per cent.
Earnings per share were 20 per cent higher at 15.4p (12.8p). The dividend is
raised by 9 per cent to 4.5p (4.13p), with a recommended final of 2.6p,
increasing cover from 3.1 to 3.4 times.
Mr Webber said that the improvement reflected increased efficiency and
profitability at the Russell Hobbs Tower division and general cost control
throughout the group.
He added, however, that the brands had experienced a mixed year. Tower
showed 'some good recovery from a small base' while Russell Hobbs had a 'bad
first quarter but a better second' and the improvement had continued into
1994-95.
Overall group sales for the first quarter of the current year showed an
encouraging improvement, Mr Webber said, and the forward order book
reflected a better trend.
He warned, however, that as the group sought increased volume margins may
come under pressure but he expected 'profits to increase as a result of the
more focused approach to the market place'.

FT  17 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Sedgwick advances to Pounds 63m - European
and North American operations fuel first-half growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Buoyed by growth in its European and North American retail operations,
Sedgwick, the insurance broker, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds
63.4m for the first six months of 1994, compared with a restated Pounds
55.8m last time.
The result was at the top end of market expectations, but was greeted
without enthusiasm by investors, with the shares closing unchanged at 169p.
Analysts were disappointed by a 4 per cent underlying decline in revenues at
Noble Lowndes, the employee benefits consultancy acquired last year, as well
as continued softness in the US insurance market from where the group
obtains more than 30 per cent of its revenues.
The interim dividend is held at 3p, while earnings per share were 7.3p
(restated 7.6p).
Brokerage and fee growth was particularly buoyant in retail operations, with
growth exceeding 5 per cent in all geographical areas. However, the
wholesale and specialist broking operations were affected by difficult
trading conditions in the London market.
On an underlying basis, excluding acquisitions, brokerage and fees increased
by 2 per cent to Pounds 457.1m, compared with an underlying increase of 1
per cent in expenses to Pounds 409.2m.
Mr Sax Riley, chief executive, said that the results were 'in line with our
plans. Revenue generation, together with tight expense control, continues to
be our major objective.'
Interest and investment income fell by 13 per cent in underlying terms to
Pounds 20.1m, partially reflecting lower interest rates in the UK and
continental Europe.
Sedgwick also announced that together with Transamerica Corporation, with
whom it shares ownership of River Thames Insurance, it is injecting Pounds
25m cash into the subsidiary.
This brings the total capitalisation of River Thames, in which Sedgwick owns
a 49 per cent stake, to over Pounds 50m. It will allow the company, which
specialises in London market business, to take advantage of 'improved
underwriting opportunities'.
Sedgwick also intends to increase its stakes in two small overseas
subsidiaries, Sedgwick Overseas Investment in Bermuda and Sedgwick Insurance
Brokers in Botswana, from 50 per cent to 100 per cent and from 70 per cent
to 95 per cent respectively.
COMMENT
Sedgwick's management seems to be doing the right things. Margins have been
squeezed through tight expense control and the acquisition last year of
Noble Lowndes makes sense from a strategic perspective, diversifying the
group's revenue base and making it less dependent on sometimes volatile
commission income. However, despite encouraging growth in retail insurance
business, many of its markets are low growth. Nor does the US market provide
much encouragement, with insurance rates disappointingly flat. The current
weakness in the dollar is another unfavourable factor and Sedgwick could
also find the going tough in the London market. Full year pre-tax profits of
about Pounds 95m for 1994 should be possible, giving earnings of about 10.7p
and a prospective multiple of 15.8. But at the present price the shares
appear to be fully valued.

FT  17 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Cantab losses rise to Pounds 1.85m at six
months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cantab Pharmaceuticals, the biotechnology company quoted both in London and
on Nasdaq in the US, yesterday reported losses increased from Pounds 1.24m
to Pounds 1.85m for the first half of 1994.
The results were in line with expectations, said Dr Paul Haycock, chief
executive of the Cambridge-based company. Operating losses widened from
Pounds 1.4m to Pounds 2.27m, as revenues fell from Pounds 618,000 to Pounds
424,000. Interest income improved from Pounds 157,000 to Pounds 419,000,
following the Pounds 13.8m placing last October.
Research and development spending rose from Pounds 1.51m to Pounds 2.17m
over the same period, as the company developed its herpes and genital warts
treatments.
Losses per share fell from 21p to 19p.
Dr Haycock said the company had net cash of Pounds 17.8m, and while he did
not expect to ask investors for additional funding this year, he did not
rule out returning to them next year.
Cantab expects to start final stage European clinical trials for its most
advanced product, LM-CD45, a drug designed to reduce the incidence of
rejection in kidney transplant operations.

FT  17 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Decline at Micro Focus prompts 18% share
fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Micro Focus, the Berkshire-based computer software company, fell
18 per cent - from Pounds 10.63p to 865p - after first-half figures well
below both market expectations and last year's result.
Profits before tax for the six months to July 31 fell from Pounds 7.8m to
Pounds 4.7m. Earnings per share came out at 32.9p, against 53.5p.
Analysts yesterday cut pre-tax profit estimates for the full year from more
than Pounds 22m to about Pounds 15.5m, giving a prospective p/e of about 12.
Opinions in the City differed on whether the company should have flagged the
extent of the shortfall earlier. In May, it had taken the unusual step of
issuing an encouraging first-quarter statement.
Mr Paul O'Grady, chairman, said that no warning had been made because the
company did not know the full extent of the profits decline until the end of
the half year. Historically, the company finishes the first half with a
surge, but this had not taken place this year. He said: 'The overall revenue
growth of 6 per cent, combined with a planned increase in costs of 23 per
cent, resulted in a decrease in earnings for the half.'
Revenues were Pounds 42.9m, compared with Pounds 40.8m. Total costs and
expenses, however, rose to Pounds 36.9m compared with Pounds 30.1m. No
dividend will be paid, in line with company policy.
Micro Focus is undergoing a painful transition. Its early success was based
on software which made it simpler for programmers to write Cobol, the most
common mainframe computer language. At one time its shares reached Pounds
30, driven by US investment.
The mainframe market is in decline, however and, following an adverse
brokers' report last year, US interest waned. Only about 20 per cent of the
stock is now held as American Depositary Receipts, compared with 40 per cent
two years ago.
The company has been investing heavily to take advantage of new markets for
networked computer systems. Mr O'Grady said that more than half the
company's revenues now came from products for the more modern technologies.
He agreed, however, that the current year was unlikely to improve or match
the Pounds 21.7m pre-tax achieved last year.
Mr O'Grady said investment would be maintained, but moves were in progress
to tighten financial controls. Mr Brian Reynolds, a co-founder, had returned
to an active role in the company.
Few, if any, companies can change their technological raison d'etre without
damage. Mr O'Grady promised to give investors an update on progress at the
end of the third quarter.

FT  17 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Kalon 15% ahead and seeking purchases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kalon, the decorative paints group, is on the look-out for acquisitions in
continental Europe after a first half which saw pre-tax profits rise 15 per
cent, from Pounds 8.7m to Pounds 10m.
Mr Mike Hennessy, managing director, said Kalon was ready to take on
acquisitions following the success of the February 1993 purchase of Novodec
in France. The group would look for potential targets in Germany and France,
and pay cash for anything up to about Pounds 25m, he said. 'It is more
likely to be a small acquisition for cash than a large one for paper,' he
said.
Kalon's results for the six months to July 2, which were struck on sales 10
per cent ahead at Pounds 83m, reassured analysts and investors unsettled by
the recent rise in raw material prices. These had increased by about 0.2 per
cent, and had been largely offset by savings on larger volumes arising from
the Novodec purchase. Mr Hennessy said higher raw material prices were
unlikely to affect profits in the second half.
The UK paint market continued to stagnate, with volumes almost static and
revenues falling by 1 per cent. Mr Hennessy said that the promotional
price-cutting of a year ago had largely disappeared and prices seemed to
have stabilised. Kalon had coped with the soft market by introducing lower
priced paint products, rather than cutting the prices of existing paints.
Kalon also benefited from its increasing emphasis on serving trade customers
through its Leyland paint centres and squeezing overheads by some Pounds
475,000. While the group's sales to retail customers fell by more than 10
per cent, trade sales rose by a similar amount. The UK paints division was
just 0.5 per cent ahead to Pounds 6.2m on sales down 4 per cent to Pounds
48m.
Novodec contributed profits of Pounds 3.5m, against Pounds 2.45m for five
months. Kalon has opened its first trade paint centre in France and plans
another for the turn of the year. Vallance, the UK sundries business
acquired in February, almost trebled profits to Pounds 414,000.
Earnings per share rose to 5.17p (4.46p). The interim dividend is lifted to
1.5p (1.3p).
COMMENT
Kalon has become a victim of its own success. Having dealt with the
management problems of the late 1980s, and established itself as a leading
own-label paint manufacturer, it has to find a new angle for growth or
stagnate. Repeating the success story in continental Europe seems logical.
Everything now depends on Mr Hennessy's talent for spotting the right
acquisitions. He will have to do something soon if he wants to alleviate
fears about the effects of rising raw material prices and a dull UK market.
Forecasts are for about Pounds 22m this year, which leaves the shares on a
prospective p/e of about 15 times. Not a compelling buy, but the prospects
could be intriguing.

FT  17 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Bowater buys window company for Pounds 35m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bowater, the packaging, printing and coated products group, yesterday
announced its first sizeable acquisition this year with the purchase of a
windows manufacturer for Pounds 34.75m in cash and a further
performance-related deferred payment of up to Pounds 5m.
The Midlands-based WH Smith &amp; Sons (Extrusions) fabricates plastic window
units as well as manufacturing the PVC-u surrounds. The company is believed
to have about 10 per cent of the UK public sector market.
Mr Michael Hartnall, finance director, said the acquisition would bring two
benefits to the group's Bowater Windows subsidiary. 'First we will get
window profiles from the UK and second, it is a way for us to get into the
commercial market,' he said.
Bowater Windows, which is estimated to make profits of about Pounds 15m on
sales of Pounds 160m, claims about 10 per cent of the UK market for sales to
residential customers. It sells direct to consumers, as well as supplying
systems to local retailers.
The purchase had been prompted by the strong increase in the value of the
D-Mark, Mr Hartnall said. Bowater Windows had been importing plastic
profiles from Germany, but exchange rate changes had made prices
prohibitive.
The acquisition is expected to enhance earnings in the first year.
Smith returned operating profits of Pounds 4m for the year to April 30, on
sales of Pounds 20m. Its net assets at the end of the financial year were
Pounds 9.3m.
Certain assets were sold to the vendors after April 30 for their net book
value of Pounds 1.7m.

Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, yesterday reported a 10 per cent rise in
third-quarter pre-tax profits to Pounds 282m, from Pounds 256m.
Turnover grew 20 per cent to Pounds 2.77bn including a Pounds 344m
contribution from Quantum Chemical, acquired in September last year. The
Pounds 2.31bn sales of the April-June period in 1993 included Pounds 253m
from discontinued businesses.
Profit before exceptional costs increased to Pounds 282m, against Pounds
266m, in spite of a jump in the net interest bill to Pounds 57m, from Pounds
1m.
The results were towards the low end of analysts' estimates and Hanson's
shares closed  1/2 p lower at 264p.
With fully diluted earnings per share rising from 3.8p to 4.1p, the
quarterly dividend was increased from 2.85p to 3p, in line with market
expectations.
Mr Derek Bonham, chief executive, said: 'In the third quarter conditions
continued to improve and the outlook is good. Despite the expected adverse
interest swing of Pounds 56m, a negative of about Pounds 10m on foreign
exchange and no contribution from exceptionals, profit on ordinary
activities advanced positively including a very satisfying contribution of
Pounds 46m from Quantum.
'As expected, gearing has continued to improve,' he added.
Figures for the first nine months showed a 26 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits, from Pounds 763m to Pounds 965m. Hanson noted that the US coal
strike which affected its Peabody operations reduced pre-tax profits by
about Pounds 80m, compared with Pounds 50m in the year-ago period.
Pre-tax profits were bolstered by Pounds 331m (Pounds 30m) of gains on
disposals, which offset net interest costs of Pounds 176m compared with net
interest receipts of Pounds 35m in the same period last year.
Profit before exceptionals fell from Pounds 733m to Pounds 634m on turnover
which rose 16.5 per cent to Pounds 8.41bn. Quantum's chemicals and propane
operations contributed Pounds 1.19bn to sales and Pounds 116m to profits.
Discontinued operations contributed Pounds 337m (Pounds 644m) to turnover
and Pounds 27m (Pounds 71m) to profits. Fully diluted earnings per share
rose from 11.5p to 14p.
Peabody has reached a preliminary agreement to purchase the assets of Carter
Mining from US-based Exxon Coal on undisclosed terms. The deal includes
Exxon's low-sulphur Rawhide and Caballo coal mines near Gillette, Wyoming
which produced about 25m tons of coal last year and is expected to be
completed this autumn.

<TEXT>
Hanson's proposed flotation of a majority stake in Ertl, the US toy
manufacturer, together with its pending acquisition of Scholes, the UK-based
electrical equipment manufacturer, highlights the Anglo-US conglomerate's
twin-track acquisition and disposals strategy.
During the 1980s the group, led by founders, Lord Hanson and Lord White,
aggressively stalked and picked off corporate giants such as SCM Chemicals,
Imperial Tobacco and Consolidated Gold Fields.
Since then the business, market and political climate on both sides of the
Atlantic have changed and most analysts believe Hanson's appetite - and
capacity - for multi-billion dollar deals has waned.
At first sight the group's Dollars 3.4bn (Pounds 2.2bn) acquisition of
Quantum Chemical, the US polyethylene and propane group, at the end of
September last year appeared to signal a return to the old swash-buckling
style. But in reality the deal represents a carefully calculated gamble on
the petrochemicals cycle.
The clear message from Mr Derek Bonham, Hanson's chief executive who was
given the additional title of deputy chairman last autumn, has been
determination to reduce debt through disposals and flotations and
concentrate on expanding its main businesses, both organically and through
'bolt-on' acquisitions.
These core businesses include aggregates, chemicals, natural resources and
tobacco.
In the wake of the Quantum acquisition, Hanson's net borrowings mushroomed
to Pounds 3.4bn from Pounds 774m a year earlier and represented gearing of
86 per cent at the end of September. Hanson then cut its interest costs by
refinancing the Dollars 2.35bn of junk bond debt assumed with the Quantum
purchase at preferential rates.
It has raised about Pounds 815m, including Pounds 490m in the UK, through a
succession of disposals including the flotation of its Beazer housebuilding
operations on both sides of the Atlantic earlier this year.
Hanson has also sold 11 UK companies to management buy-out teams backed by
Electra, the venture capital group, at the end of December for Pounds 90m.
In America Hanson has sold the Axelson oil industry equipment group for
Pounds 56m and Hanson Office Products contract stationery business for
Pounds 110m.
The group recorded a profit of Pounds 333m from disposals in its first half
and gearing fell to 69 per cent by the end of March.
Excluding the proposed Pounds 96.1m purchase of Scholes, which has yet to be
completed - the company has agreed to the Hanson bid, but said it was open
to higher offers - analysts estimate that net borrowings are around Pounds
2.55bn, putting gearing at around 54 per cent.
The planned flotation of Ertl, whose products include die-cast models of
Thomas the Tank Engine, plastic model kits and the best-selling Bumble Ball,
is expected to generate Dollars 200m in cash for Hanson this autumn. Hanson
plans to retain a 37 per cent stake in the Iowa-based toy maker.
But despite Hanson's balance sheet improvements, Ertl's stock market debut
this autumn is unlikely to signal the end of the disposal programme.
Analysts expect Hanson to focus on its smaller US consumer and industrial
subsidiaries as the group has already sold most small non-core operations in
the UK.
Among the US recreation and leisure operations which could be sold are Tommy
Armour golf equipment, the Valley pool table business and Farberware kitchen
products.
Elsewhere Hanson is expected to continue making smaller bolt-on purchases
such as the proposed Scholes deal. If completed, Scholes would be used to
strengthen the position of Hanson's Crabtree subsidiary in the increasingly
competitive UK electrical installation equipment market.
Hanson's transformation from an acquisitions-driven, deal-making machine of
the 1980s into a more conventional international conglomerate is being
orchestrated by Mr Bonham, heir apparent to Lord Hanson, and his US
counterpart, Mr David Clarke, chief executive of the US operations.
Analysts caution that while most of the future acquisitions are likely to be
of the 'fill-in' type, it is too soon to dismiss the possibility of Hanson
making further big opportunistic acquisitions - particularly as gearing is
brought down to more comfortable levels.
Underlining this, Mr Clarke has been quoted as saying that the US disposal
programme enables management to focus on 'the next big deal'.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Electrolux soars on strong US sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Large capital gains and a strong underlying recovery helped Electrolux, the
world's biggest manufacturer of household appliances, to multiply its
first-half profits.
The pre-tax figure, after financial items, jumped to SKr4.43bn (Dollars
570m) from SKr605m including SKr2.77bn in capital gains on disposals.
Excluding these items, the result was up 174 per cent at SKr1.66bn, slightly
ahead of expectations of SKr1.52bn.
Operating income climbed 71 per cent to SKr2.50bn. The upturn was led by the
group's household appliance division and reflected cost-cutting, new product
launches and better demand in the US and Europe.
The US market had a particularly strong second quarter, helped by hot
weather which drove up sales of air conditioning and outdoor equipment. The
pattern in Europe was less of clear recovery than of stabilisation in some
markets, such as the UK, Spain and Nordic countries, and a slowing of the
downturn in others, such as Italy and France. The company remains cautious
about prospects in Europe, warning that interest rate rises could undermine
the turnround. It expects a slight slowing of US sales.
The second half will see lower financial costs after a disposal programme
which has cut net debt by SKr7.5bn since last year. The main disposal was
Autoliv, the car safety equipment manufacturer, which contributed a SKr2.9bn
capital gain.
Group sales expanded to SKr55.5bn from SKr49.6bn, up 8 per cent on an
underlying basis. Higher volumes account for most of the increase, although
Mr Leif Johansson, chief executive, signalled that the group had obtained
some price increases.
'We are beginning to see limited price increases, both in the US and in
Europe, particularly in outdoor products,' he said. The company also
believes it has slightly increased its market share in Europe and US through
own-brand sales.
Second-quarter profits, excluding capital gains, rose to SKr991m from
SKr483m. The group said that underlying operating margins during the period
had increased to 5 per cent from 3.5 per cent.
First-half household appliance sales rose 11.2 per cent to SKr31.5bn, from
SKr28.3bn.

FT  17 AUG 94 / New swap provides a hedge against higher UK taxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Morgan Grenfell, the UK merchant bank, has entered a UK tax rate swap, which
could mark the opening of a new market for hedging tax exposure.
The agreement, signed this month, will allow its client to protect itself
from future variations in UK corporate tax rates. Companies routinely
consider tax implications when entering interest rate and currency swaps but
a tax swap is more radical.
The swap would allow companies to hedge against changes in tax rates and as
a result to maintain their level of post-tax profits regardless of the tax
effects triggered by policy changes or switches in political regimes.
Morgan Grenfell has taken on its own books a swap relating to Pounds 15m
income from leases payable to an international bank. The agreement runs over
four years - until after the next general election. If UK tax rates fall
below the current 33 per cent, Morgan Grenfell will pay out the saving in
the tax charge to the client. Morgan Grenfell says the swap has a natural
hedge because it can offset any payments or receipts against the effects
that any tax rate change will have on its own corporate profits.
Its profits on the deal came from a fixed fee, but it believes future
agreements could be based on a commission and may be hedged around rates
other than 33 per cent. It is seeking counterparties for this swap and is
considering a number of similar arrangements with other clients.
Mr Neil Jeffares, a director in the banking division at Morgan Grenfell,
said the client had provided 'a very satisfactory fee'. The product would be
ideal for UK companies or multinationals with UK tax liabilities, although
it would be more difficult for a UK bank to enter swaps hedging against tax
changes in other countries.
According to derivatives specialists, there have been tax swaps in the past
ahead of general elections, particularly in anticipation of a shift from a
right to left-wing government, such as in the US in 1991 and 1992 because of
fears of a tax rate rise under a Clinton administration.
However, a number of factors have tended to inhibit the development of a tax
swap market. It may be hard to find counterparties for companies trying to
offset tax risk.
In addition, tax authorities have tended to frown on structures devised
purely for tax reasons. 'The mood these days is that it is the spirit and
not the letter of tax law that counts,' said one head of swaps at a
London-based bank. However, the Morgan swap does not affect the amount of
tax payable to the Exchequer.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Owners' choice boils down brands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Owners Abroad, the UK's third largest travel company, yesterday renamed
itself First Choice Holidays in an attempt to regain market share.
Mr Francis Baron, chief executive since November, said the group's previous
unco-ordinated branding and marketing had been the root cause of its poor
performance.
The group's eight brands - which included Enterprise, Sunmed and Olympic -
are being replaced by three. First Choice will be for the mass market,
catering particularly for families. The group is retaining its upmarket
Sovereign brand. The third brand will be FreeSpirit, for adults without
children.
The City marked the group's shares down 2p to 107p. Mr Bruce Jones, an
analyst at Smith New Court, said this reflected fears that rivals such as
Thomson and Airtours would respond vigorously to the launch of First Choice.
Both brought out their summer 1995 brochures earlier this month.
Mr Jones said: 'Airtours are not the sort of people to say how nice it is to
have a strong number three.' He said the rebranding appeared to have been
researched thoroughly. 'It's almost a classic business school exercise.
Analyse the market, analyse where you are and then bite the bullet.'
Mr Baron said that Airtours' unsuccessful bid for Owners Abroad last year
had not been the cause of his group's problems but the result of them.
Owners Abroad's share of the summer market had fallen from 16 per cent in
1992 to an estimated 12 per cent this year. Operating margins had declined
from 5 per cent in 1991 to 2 per cent last year.
The proliferation of Owners Abroad's brands meant that none could be
supported properly, Mr Baron said. Thomson last year spent Pounds 15m
advertising two brands. Airtours spent Pounds 8.3m on two brands. By
contrast, Owners Abroad spent Pounds 4.5m on eight brands.
The result was a lack of consumer awareness. In a recent survey, only 3 per
cent of consumers showed an unprompted awareness of any of the Owners Abroad
brands. By contrast, 55 per cent were aware of Thomson. Many thought Owners
Abroad was a timeshare company.
Mr Baron said a Pounds 5m provision for the change would be taken in this
year's accounts. He hoped the move would help win back 1 percentage point of
lost market share next summer.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Israel closes bourse for two days: Government wants market
to assess sweeping financial changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel will close its stock exchange today and tomorrow after announcing
plans yesterday to introduce sweeping financial changes, including a capital
gains tax on stock market profits and an easing of foreign exchange
controls.
The foreign exchange liberalisation will significantly increase the ability
of Israeli companies to invest abroad. Foreign companies are also to have
the right to issue shares for the first time on the Tel Aviv market.
Mr Avraham Shochat, the finance minister, said the Tel Aviv stock exchange
would remain closed for two days to give the volatile market, which has
plunged about 20 per cent from its peak this year, time to assess the new 10
per cent tax on inflation-adjusted capital gains, due to take effect from
January 1 1995.
As the market normally closes on Fridays and Saturdays, trading will not
resume until Sunday.
Government officials said the new capital gains tax, which will not be
levied on provident funds, would raise Sh500m (Pounds 106m) allowing the
Treasury to cut employers' taxes and stimulate growth. Officials said the
move also brought Israel into line with global markets which tax profits on
share trading.
Market analysts said they expected a wave of selling when the market
reopened and said the move could delay the government's privatisation
programme and confuse dozens of companies planning new issues. They said
they hoped the government would make changes to allow individuals to offset
the tax against share losses before implementation
In a separate move, the Bank of Israel announced a radical liberalisation of
foreign exchange controls. Among the measures are the right of Israeli
companies to invest an unlimited amount of their working capital abroad,
abolishing a rule limiting such investment to 40 per cent of their capital.
Separately, companies will now be able to invest up to 10 per cent of their
equity or 5 per cent of sales - whichever amount is the largest - either in
foreign stocks or in deposits in foreign banks, both of which have hitherto
been off limits. Previously only companies which exported goods could hold a
proportion of their export revenues abroad.
Foreign companies will now also be allowed to raise capital on the Tel Aviv
exchange, but the bank indicated that legislation would be required and that
it did not yet have a timetable for the change.
Yesterday's liberalisation also permits provident and pension funds to
invest up to 2 per cent of their assets on global stock markets.
Mr Jacob Frenkel, governor of the bank, said: 'These steps bring the Israeli
shekel very close to becoming an internationally convertible currency and
will speed up the integration between Israeli and international capital
markets.'

FT  17 AUG 94 / Public sector borrowing likely to fall below Treasury
forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's public sector borrowing requirement fell to Pounds 1.1bn in July,
indicating that the government is having success in keeping tight control of
its spending programmes.
Many economists are now convinced that the full year borrowing requirement
for the financial year 1994-95 will fall short of the Treasury's Pounds
36.1bn forecast. Estimates of the likely deficit range between Pounds 30bn
and Pounds 34bn.
The improvement in public finances increases the chances that the government
might be able to cut taxes before the next election. But analysts warned
that the government would be unwise to announce cuts in the November Budget.
Mr Adrian Cooper, UK economist at stockbroker James Capel, said: 'We would
be concerned about such tax cuts unless they were funded by clear cuts in
public expenditure since the better than expected PSBR outlook owes much to
economic growth being stronger than official forecasts. In these
circumstances, tax cuts not matched by spending cuts would only fuel already
robust demand growth.'
In the first four months of the financial year, the cumulative public sector
borrowing requirement was Pounds 12.5bn, compared with Pounds 14.8bn in the
first four months of 1993-94. If privatisation proceeds are excluded, the
running total this year is Pounds 13.4bn, compared with Pounds 18.3bn in
1993-94.
Government coffers were swelled in July by the repayment of some Pounds 380m
of debt by privatised electricity companies and Northern Ireland airports.
Excluding privatisation proceeds, the July deficit was Pounds 1.5bn.
The better-than-expected performance in government finances this year has
mainly been due to a decline in public spending. Revenues from taxes and
other government income have risen less quickly than the Treasury forecast,
although these contributed most to the overall improvement.
Receipts from taxes, excise duties and other income totalled Pounds 69.9bn
in the four month period, 4.5 per cent higher than the Pounds 66.9bn
received in the same period in 1993-94.
Public spending, in the form of net departmental outlays, reached Pounds
77.9bn in the first four months, 2 per cent lower than in the same period in
1993-94. Treasury forecasts had predicted an 11 per cent gain in revenues
and a 4 per cent rise in spending this financial year.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Calculators fail to boost maths skills of pupils in UK
schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British school pupils lead the world in their use of calculators - but not
in their mathematics skills, UK government education inspectors said
yesterday.
In England, 87 per cent of primary schools not only permit the use of
calculators but also provide them for their pupils. In Scotland, the figure
is 95 per cent, said the report by the Office for Standards in Education
(Ofsted).
Asian countries are far more strict. In South Korea, no primary schools
provide their children with calculators, while 55 per cent ban their use
altogether.
Findings by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research published
last year showed English pupils scoring an average of 59.5 per cent in
standardised international mathematics tests, while Korea and Taiwan, where
only 1 per cent of primary schools provide calculators, both achieved 73 per
cent.
The inspectors' report, which also detailed widespread shortcomings in the
teaching of mathematics and science in England and Wales, said schools
should consider whether children used calculators too much.
Mr Mike Tomlinson, Ofsted's director of inspection, said: 'We need to look
at their use to make sure they are not usurping the teaching of basic skills
in mathematics.
'The important thing is the balance between using them and developing and
understanding the principles of basic numeracy.'
Calculators are less widely provided in British secondary schools, but they
are still available to more pupils than in any of the other countries
covered by the report. In England, half of all schools provide calculators,
compared with 21 per cent in the US, 19 per cent in the former Soviet Union
and 17 per cent in France.
In South Korea, no secondary schools give their pupils access to
calculators, while 35 per cent bar their use.
The report concluded that in England and Wales 'not all science and
mathematics teachers have the skills and talents required to do their job'.

FT  17 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Directors' pay
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If institutional shareholders want to end the sort of compensation package
Reed Elsevier agreed with Mr Peter Davis, they will have to do more than
call for the abolition of three-year rolling contracts. It is hard to judge
what difference it would have made had Mr Davis been on only a two-year
contract. But since the bulk of the Pounds 2m settlement consists of
enhanced pension entitlements for two years, it is safe to assume not much.
The award is by no means the most extreme example of corporate largesse in
recent years and few would deny that Reed's shareholders have been
handsomely rewarded during Mr Davis' stay. The company says that this was
reflected in the size of the settlement as were the chances of his getting
another job.
Perhaps in an ideal world, executives would have contracts which paid out
only until they found another post. But this is widely considered
impractical if only because it provides them with no incentive. It should,
however, be possible to link compensation more explicitly with performance.
Unless companies get tougher in negotiating severance terms on an
executive's departure, there will be increasing calls for contracts to be a
maximum of one year. Such a move would be fiercely resisted by companies.
Handsome pay-offs can be a convenient way of keeping disgruntled former
directors quiet. But it would be hard to convince investors that paying hush
money was in their interests.

FT  17 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Hanson
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The more bullish medium-term profits forecasts for Hanson depend heavily on
the recovery potential at Quantum Chemical. So its strong Pounds 46m profit
contribution in the third quarter was particularly encouraging. As ethylene
and polyethylene prices have continued to improve there should be plenty
more to come. SCM Chemicals, which was lagging behind the general
improvement in the first half, has also seen prices start to harden.
The strong third quarter has pushed up underlying growth in operating
profits from around 8 1/2 per cent in the first half to an estimated 12 per
cent in the nine months. Although the third quarter was slightly flattered
by comparison with an unusually weak period for Imperial Tobacco last year,
the trends are strongly positive. Given the shares' high rating, the market
expects nothing less.
On some brokers' forecasts, the shares are on a premium to the market as far
ahead as 1996. While the shares yield a fat 5.7 per cent, Hanson needs to
rebuild dividend cover significantly given the cyclical nature of its
businesses and the longer-term threats to Imperial Tobacco's profits.
Disposals, such as the Ertl float, are revitalising the balance sheet but
even at the full price suggested it is not expected to enhance earnings.
Before long, some of the old Hanson magic will be required to justify the
rating.

FT  17 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Electrolux
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Electrolux's empire-building has yet to produce the right result for
shareholders. Group sales have almost trebled since the acquisition of
Zanussi in 1984. But operating profits last year were barely higher. The 30
per cent rise in the shares this year only makes up ground lost to the
Swedish market over the decade. Even allowing for the deeply cyclical nature
of its white goods and aluminium businesses, that must be counted as a
disappointment. The question is whether yesterday's impressive first-half
results mark the moment when the strategy starts to pay off.
The operational gearing implied by yesterday's figures is certainly a reason
for optimism. Sales increased by an underlying 8 per cent yet operating
profits rose by 71 per cent. The manufacturing rationalisation and
cost-cutting which depressed profits over the years seem to be bearing
fruit. Operating margins of over 6 per cent - last achieved in 1989, against
4.5 per cent in the first half - should be within reach.
Competition from the likes of Whirlpool and General Electric could yet upset
such calculations. The white goods market has so far been spared the
ferocious discounting of consumer electronics. In Europe, though, Electrolux
now looks fully capable of defending itself. By adding AEG's appliances
business to its portfolio earlier in the year, Electrolux denied its rivals
market share and another valuable brand. There is still work to be done;
returns in the US remain too low and it is difficult to see what the group
brings to aluminium smelting. But these are minor problems compared to those
it would be facing if it had sat back and watched the industry restructure.

FT  17 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Fed's firm hand
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's increase in US interest rates is welcome. It is evidence that
the Federal Reserve is prepared to act early to damp inflationary pressures.
With the US economy poised to grow nearly 4 per cent this year and the
recovery in its fourth year, capacity constraints cannot be far away. There
must also be a limit to how long industry can shoulder higher raw material
prices without these feeding through into retail price inflation. The bitter
history is that once inflation is clearly visible, it is already too late
for central banks to act.
The Fed's strong line on inflation, though widely expected, should underpin
US bond markets. Interest rates will have to rise again towards the end of
the year but the half-point increase in official interest rates means there
should be a respite for at least a few months. The dollar should also be
less vulnerable.
The Fed's move is good news for European bond and equity markets, which tend
to take their lead from US bond markets. A more important factor, though,
will be how the Bundesbank acts in the coming days and weeks. Markets are
still divided over whether German interest rates have hit their bottom. A
further downward tick in the repurchase rate following tomorrow's Bundesbank
council meeting is a possibility. That would probably give short-term relief
to other European markets, which are struggling to maintain their attraction
in the face of a strong D'Mark. But with signs that the German economy is
motoring ahead, the Bundesbank would be wise to hold rates steady for now
and prepare markets for an upward move in the New Year.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Mix 'n' match tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A rose by any other name might smell as sweet, but taxes need all the
re-labelling they can get. Cynics would say that this was the logic behind
earmarking taxes, an idea which is gaining favour within both of the UK's
main opposition parties. In fact, proposals such as those published
yesterday by the Liberal Democrats stem from a desire to improve the
substance of fiscal policy-making. Unfortunately, earmarking taxes is not
the answer.
Yesterday's report suggests a number of areas where 'hypothecation' -
earmarking a chunk of tax revenues for a particular purpose - could be used
to raise public confidence in taxation policies. Although the Liberal
Democrats have taken it furthest, the same notion has gained support in the
Labour camp. Its proponents claim that hypothecation is not merely a
marketing exercise, but aims to raise the transparency and accountability of
fiscal policy.
In theory, earmarked taxes would heighten the public's awareness of the
connection between taxes and services. Better informed about the trade-offs
between the two, it could discuss fiscal policy more honestly, and officials
could be held more accountable for the way those trade-offs are agreed and
implemented. In practice, however, 're-connecting' taxes and services, at a
national level at least, is likely to mislead the public or, worse, leave
the tax system even less capable of delivering difficult reforms.
At its simplest, earmarked taxation is a mere re-labelling exercise, as in
the case of national insurance contributions, which are separable from
income tax in name only. This reduces transparency, since the public is
given a misleading picture of the link between contributions and benefits. A
more honest way to earmark revenues would be to ring-fence them, along the
lines of the television licence fee. But this might lower accountability
since officials would no longer have to defend their expenditures every
year.
A deeper drawback is that the earmarked revenues would be prey to the
business cycle. As the Liberal Democrat report notes, this severely limits
the scope for hypothecation: it would be senseless for unemployment
benefits, for example, to be bound by revenue from cyclically variable
taxes. The authors also argue that means-tested benefits should not be
hypothecated, because there needs to be 'a fairly close correlation between
those who pay the tax and those who benefit from the expenditure.' Broader
application of the latter principle threatens two undesirable effects: a
greater emphasis on taxes which are easily personalised, such as taxes on
employment, and a balkanised tax base, as different interests vie to sell
their causes to the public.
Better informed public debates about fiscal policy could help rebuild public
trust in politicians, but hypothecation is a quick fix. Declaring that a
proportion of income tax is to be replaced by a 'health service tax' may
sound attractive, but it is not the same thing as debating the future of the
national health service.
Some of the report's ideas could have more positive results: the idea of
sending a yearly tax and spending statement to each UK household, for
example, is a good one. But if the opposition parties, particularly Labour,
wish to win the next election by addressing people as citizens, not only as
consumers, they should avoid proposals that risk making such a presentation
of the public budget look uncannily like a shopping list.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Testifying to Congress last month, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of the
Federal Reserve, claimed that it was 'an open question' whether US interest
rates had increased enough to head off inflationary pressures. Yesterday's
half-point rise in rates closed it for the time-being.
Timing of such decisions can be debated endlessly. Since interest rate
changes have most of their effect a year or two after the event, such debate
is fruitless. What matters more is the direction and size of the change. Mr
Greenspan's Federal Reserve likes fine-tuning policy. By those standards,
this is a decisive move, one that shifts US monetary policy close to his
elusive objective of 'neutrality'.
The case for such a move is provided by the domestic economy. The aim, one
that is close to Mr Greenspan's heart, is non-inflationary growth. By those
standards higher interest rates were evidently justified.
The recovery, now more than four years old, has brought the economy near to
full capacity. But employment growth remains quite strong, as does that of
the economy. The world economy is now also picking up. Meanwhile, the slope
of the yield curve - the gap between short and long-term rates of interest -
is still strongly positive. One reason has been the rise in the interest
rate on long bonds. While difficult to interpret with confidence, this rise
suggests that the credibility of monetary policy remains fragile.
The Federal Reserve is merely doing its job and deserves support when doing
so. What it will receive from many politicians instead is condemnation. Such
carping should be ignored. They are also just doing their job.

A colleague on holiday in France reports the loss of a prized possession. Or
should that read 'prised'? An unknown trophy hunter has walked off with the
emblem from his car's bonnet.
No Rolls-Royce Flying Lady this, nor even a rare Wartburg, but the rather
more humble Vauxhall 'griffin' badge.
The various Mercs, BMWs and Saabs in the same car park had not been touched,
so maybe Vauxhall badges have now become collector's items, rather as VW
emblems were a few years ago.
Perhaps there is a certain cachet on the Continent in having an English
badge in your collection. If so, there is a certain irony: the replacement
'griffin' was made in Germany.

Observer's passing reference to The Hecklers - a band of musical terrorists
whose mission is to rid Britain of the 'sonic sewage of modern music' - has
struck a chord. Several readers have written to ask how they may join the
club.
Keith Burstein's your man. He's a composer who first saw action when he
joined in the booing at the end of Sir Harrison Birtwistle's opera Gawain
earlier this year. However, when the editor of a high-brow musical
publication described Burstein's criticism as 'bollocks', Burstein decided
he had to raise his own campaign by a couple of octaves.
Last week, he held a debate ahead of a promenade concert featuring Sir Peter
Maxwell Davies's Fifth Symphony. A gratifying number of publishers of avant
garde cacophony was present to talk about whether modernism will survive the
20th century. Anyone interested in further events can ring Burstein on
081-675 2252 - but please don't heckle.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is rare indeed for an Australian teapot to be the centre of a diplomatic
incident. However, Australia's ex-prime minister Bob Hawke has managed to
elevate the case of his disappearing antique tea-pot into something of a
cause celebre.
Indeed, future chroniclers of late 20th century Australian politics may well
date the breakdown in friendly relations between Bob Hawke and Australia's
current prime minister, Paul Keating, to the tea-time dispute in Bob Hawke's
sitting room one weekend in the early 1980s.
The spat is culled from Hawke's just published memoirs. Apparently, Keating,
well known for his love of antique clocks and cutlery, had left a favourite
and carefully wrapped antique tea set with Hawke to look after for a weekend
while he was out of town. Hawke thought the tea set was a gift and used it
to serve Keating tea when he returned to collect it.
'Paul, close to apoplexy, grabbed the pieces, went to the kitchen, wrapped
them up, took them home and repeated the loving process of polishing and
wrapping,' is Hawke's version of what happened next. After that, it seems,
their relationship was all downhill.
Keating has tried to maintain a statesmanlike attitude to his predecessor's
revelations published yesterday.
However, he could not avoid taking a side swipe when launching a television
university learning programme. 'This, of course, is not the only launch
today, but I'll bet pounds to peanuts that this one has a longer-term
influence on Australia than the other one.'
As for Hawke, he insists his book is a balanced history, but has backed down
from an earlier undertaking to take a lie detector test to defend it.

One by one the contenders who missed out on the editor's job at The

Matt Ridley, the youngest of the bunch who left last year, picked up his
first non-executive directorship at the Northern Rock Building Society.
Now comes news that Jim Rohwer, the mag's executive editor, is quitting
after 13 years to join CS First Boston's economics team. The 45-year-old
Californian only returned to London this year after three years as Asia
correspondent. Now he is heading back to Hong Kong where he will provide the

His arrival at CS First Boston should help raise the average age of the

FT  17 AUG 94 / Observer: Gummer's just in time
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UK environment secretary John Gummer clearly rubs along rather better with
the European Union's environment commissioner than he does with his opposite
number in Norway.
Far from being called unfortunate names, Gummer was last weekend on the
receiving end of sumptuous hospitality from John Paleocrassas, the EU
commissioner.
Entertaining on his staunchly orthodox native isle of Andros, Paleocrassas
first managed to drum up a Catholic priest to celebrate the feast of the
Assumption specially for the Gummer family. Then, on a more secular note,
the Andriots turned out in force for the annual Yacht Club dance. On a
moonlit waterfront, Gummer led the proceedings and was later spotted doing
an energetic Greek nisiotiko with his hosts. His efforts at the latter
earned him the approval of one cigar-chomping tycoon who was heard to mutter
something about 'a real sense of rhythm'. But then, as a Catholic, that's
the only method he has any practice at.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Cut the strings on the parachute: Some UK executives receive
large pay-offs on leaving companies, but pressure is mounting for reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Tim Redman became a non-executive director of UK regional brewer
Greene King this summer, after 17 years as an executive director, he
received a pay-off of Pounds 165,000. Greene King is chaired by Mr Simon
Redman - Tim's cousin - and the company states in its annual report that the
money was paid after the termination of his employment contract.
Mr Simon Redman describes the pay-off as 'entirely appropriate'. But to some
institutional shareholders it is another example of how companies are
willing to pay out large sums to former directors.
The issue of executive pay-offs has been brought into the spotlight recently
as a succession of directors have received seven-figure sums when they they
have left leading UK companies. Both the City of London and the government
are becoming increasingly uneasy about 'golden parachutes', and are stepping
up calls for large pay-offs to be curtailed.
The principal cause of high pay-outs are so-called rolling contracts -
employment contracts without a fixed term but with a lengthy notice period,
often of up to three years. Directors who have such contracts usually
receive large sums in compensation if their employment is terminated at any
time.
In recent months, companies which have agreed to large pay-offs to directors
on long rolling contracts - for instance, the Pounds 2.02m paid to Mr Peter
Davis by Anglo-Dutch publisher Reed Elsevier following his resignation as
co-chairman - have been put under pressure by campaigns to reform this
practice.
One institutional shareholder, PosTel, has been largely responsible for
bringing the issue to public attention. Its chief executive, Mr Alastair
Ross Goobey, announced recently that he would be using PosTel's Pounds
25bn-worth of funds - which control about 1.5 per cent of the shares of each
company quoted on the FT-SE All-Share index - to vote against the election
and re-election of directors who have rolling contracts with notice periods
of longer than two years.
Mr Ross Goobey wants three-year rolling contracts to become a thing of the
past. Currently the norm for directors of the largest UK quoted companies,
they legally entitle a director to a pay-off the equivalent of three times
basic salary. In particular he wants to end large payments to directors
forced out following poor performance.
He argues that moving 'to two-year rolling contracts is the first step in
reducing the level of pay-offs'. Ideally, Mr Ross Goobey would like to see
pay-offs to directors limited to one year's total remuneration. 'It is
difficult to see any circumstances in which a director should get more than
one year's money in a pay-off,' he said.
Two months on from the launch of his campaign, there are signs of change.
Even though three-year rolling contracts were effectively endorsed by the
Cadbury Committee on corporate governance, whose code of practice took
effect in July last year, evidence suggests that shorter rolling contracts -
probably of two years - or fixed-term contracts could become the rule at
leading UK companies.
'A trickle of companies changing their contracts has turned to a steady
flow,' Mr Ross Goobey said. yesterday.
PosTel's campaign appears to have the backing of Mr Michael Heseltine, trade
and industry secretary. Mr Heseltine said recently: 'I would personally like
to see a much stronger role of share owners acting to ensure these sort of
practices (large pay-offs) are constrained.'
The size of the problem is clear. A survey of the FT-SE Mid 250 index of the
250 largest quoted companies by Pirc, the UK corporate governance
consultancy, found that compensation payments to former directors, disclosed
in company accounts published in the year to June 30, totalled more than
Pounds 19.4m.
This included a Pounds 3.1m payment to Mr John Cahill when he resigned in
February this year as chairman of British Aerospace, and Pounds 2.2m to
Chris Greentree, former chief executive of oil company Lasmo, when he
stepped down in January 1993.
More recently, Mr John Bellak, former chairman of Severn Trent, was paid
more than Pounds 512,626 in compensation for early retirement from the board
of the privatised water company. The figure comprised Pounds 404,829 for
'early termination of his service contract' and Pounds 107,797 for future
pension payments. Mr Bellak also received a salary package of Pounds
230,300.
The scope for future pay-offs remains vast. Directors at 44 FT-SE 100 index
companies have three-year rolling contracts, including 13 directors of
Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer group. Another 43 companies do not have
any directors on contracts with rolling contracts longer than two years.
Of the 44 companies with directors on three-year rolling contracts, several
have recently paid compensation to former directors. For instance, when Dr
Ernest Mario was ousted from his three-year rolling contract at
pharmaceuticals group Glaxo in March 1993, he received a pay-off of Pounds
2.7m, to be paid over three years. Seven of the company's executive
directors are still on three-year rolling contracts, which presents a
potential liability to shareholders of about Pounds 11m. The figure
represents three times the annual salary of all seven directors. PosTel
plans to vote against the re-election of those directors on three-year
rolling contracts up for re-election at Glaxo's annual general meeting later
this year.
A small but growing number of companies has heeded PosTel's warning. Four
FT-SE 100 companies, including Ladbroke, the leisure group, have decided to
put new directors on two-year rolling contracts, and nine other companies in
the index have moved, or are planning to move, all their directors to
acceptable contracts.
The most striking example of the influence of PosTel and other institutional
shareholders is the announcement by Guinness, the drinks group, last week
that three of its executive directors had moved from three-year rolling
contracts to three-year fixed-term contracts to be renewed annually.
Guinness said the company's 'non-executive committee', which sets executive
pay, had made the change after it had 'listened to shareholders', including
'one shareholder in particular'. Its most recently published report and
accounts for the year ending December 31 1993 showed the company had agreed
to pay Mr Crispin Davis, an executive director until his resignation last
October, the sum of Pounds 670,000. Such pay-offs should no longer be made.
Other examples of companies which have pruned their directors' three-year
rolling contracts include British Gas and Argyll, the UK's third-largest
food retailer, which announced its move at its annual meeting last month. At
British Aerospace the three-year rolling contracts of three executive
directors, including chief executive Dick Evans, are set to be cut soon.
Textiles group Courtaulds is also considering PosTel's demand to shorten
contracts. Mr Sipko Huismans, chief executive, was one of the first
directors to have his re-election voted against by PosTel at the company's
annual general meeting last month, though his re-election went ahead.
While many UK companies have been swayed by PosTel, some companies and fund
managers are critical of Mr Ross Goobey's stance. Some argue the campaign
will do little to reduce the size of pay-offs. 'PosTel's move is like
pushing a balloon in one point which then comes out in another point. Life
may not be as simple as PosTel thinks,' one fund manager said.
Companies such as Thorn EMI, where four directors including chairman Sir
Colin Southgate are on three-year rolling contracts, say they will resist
PosTel. Other opponents have tried to sidestep a possible confrontation. At
BAT, for example, whose own Threadneedle Asset Management subsidiary has
Pounds 30bn under management, six executive directors - five of whom have
three-year rolling contracts - have had a clause inserted in their contracts
by the company which says that they must search for another job if they are
forced off the BAT board. If they do not, their compensation will be
affected. Whether the clause is sufficient to ward off action by PosTel
against the directors with three-year rolling contracts is unclear.
For a small, but influential, group of fund managers and severance pay
lawyers, PosTel's campaign does not go far enough. They argue that pruning
one year off directors' contracts will do little to cut pay-offs, and that
Mr Ross Goobey should concentrate on persuading companies to be tougher in
compensation negotiations. 'The size of pay-offs should be the issue and not
the length of contracts,' one director said.
According to Ms Melanie Tether, a partner in City law firm Norton Rose who
specialises in employment law, reducing a director's notice period from
three to two years is likely to reduce the average pay-off from twice basic
salary to one and a half times. While directors can claim up to three years'
pay on a three-year rolling contract, they usually settle for less.
'Moving from three years to two years will not make a big difference to the
size of payments as the third year is the one the company has the strongest
case for not paying out,' she said, because most former directors should
have found a job after two years.
Ms Tether said institutions should try to persuade companies in which they
have a significant stake to go through with 'one or two test cases' in which
they show willingness to take former directors demanding substantial
pay-offs to court. The threat of court action could be based on an
executive's poor performance, for instance, or on his or her failure to seek
new employment. At the moment, less than 5 per cent of executive pay-off
negotiations in which she had been engaged had ended up in court, she said.
The view that companies should be tougher in pay-off negotiations is
supported by Mr Peter Brown of the Top Pay Research Group, an independent
pay consultancy. 'PosTel's stance is entirely positive,' he said. 'But there
should be more of an emphasis on mitigation - one or two cases will sort it
out.'
PosTel points out that most large companies refuse to use legal action to
limit pay-offs, even to directors forced out for poor performance because it
is both costly and time-cosuming. Mr Ross Goobey admits that his campaign is
'a bit of a blunderbuss - but then at least it is doing something about the
issue . . . We shall monitor the effect of a general move to two-year
contracts before deciding our next move.'
For some, the public nature of Mr Ross Goobey's initiative is its most
important characteristic, regardless of its effectiveness. 'The PosTel
decision represents a major boost for proxy voting in the UK as it is the
first time that a major institutional investor has publicly announced a
voting policy which is specifically intended to change boardroom practice,'
said Mr Stuart Bell, research director of Pirc.
Mr Ross Goobey's influence in changing boardroom practices will be put to
the test next month at a meeting of the investment committee of the
Association of British Insurers. On the agenda for discussion is the
possible damage that the campaign is doing to the relationship between
companies and institutional shareholders.
One committee member said: 'We want to try to contain the damage that has
been done. There is general concern on our committee that we do not want to
damage relationships with companies.' He said PosTel's move could lead to
companies bucking the trend towards openness which started after the Cadbury
report.
'A crusade in the press is not our style,' said a spokesman for Mercury
Asset Management, the fund management group. 'We believe we can be just as
effective by maintaining a healthy dialogue with the managers of the
companies in which we invest.'
There are, though, some signs of support for PosTel from other institutional
shareholders. The National Association of Pension Funds, for instance, has
said it is considering modifying its advice to members on contracts ahead of
possible modifications to the Cadbury Code in 1995.
And one other leading institutional shareholder said it had also started
voting at annual general meetings against the re-election of those directors
who sanction large pay-offs. A spokesman said: 'It's simple really - if
someone succeeds, they are entitled to lots of money. But if they fail, they
should not be made rich. We are striking at the directors who really count.'

FT  17 AUG 94 / Leading Article: A Korean deal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The outline agreement between North Korea and the US to defuse the mounting
tension over Pyongyang's nuclear programme is at one level a victory for
quiet diplomacy. North Korea has agreed to suspend its provocative graphite
reactor programme, which is capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium,
and to allow international inspection of its nuclear facilities. In return
it will receive less controversial western water-cooled reactor technology
and diplomatic links to the outside world. The threat of a large scale North
Korean nuclear weapons programme, which was real only a few weeks ago, has
thus receded.
On another level, however, the agreement is an attempt by the US to make the
best of a pretty bad job. Washington's options for pressing Pyongyang to
honour the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty were extremely limited. Direct
military action was probably unrealistic and certainly would have unsettled
regional allies as well as provoking a sharp response from China and Russia;
economic sanctions would have had little impact, given North Korea's near
total isolation from international trade. So instead of sticks, the US has
opted for carrots.
Offering incentives - such as funding of the new nuclear plant by its allies
 -will buy the US some reassurance: the halting of further plutonium
reprocessing will stop the flow of potential bomb-making material, while the
examination of North Korean sites will allow an audit of the plutonium
produced so far. Yet at heart, this is little more than containment of the
problem. Without deeply intrusive inspections, bound to raise North Korean
hackles, there can be little certainty that some nuclear material does not
remain hidden.
Washington may be reluctant to push the verification issue to the degree
required for absolute certainty, lest the agreement reached so far collapse.
It may make the pragmatic decision that having found itself in a weak
position, the best it can hope for is the near-certainty that the North
Korean nuclear capability remains small.
Still, even if pragmatic, this stance does raise some difficult questions.
At the minimum, the deal rewards bad behaviour by North Korea. At worst, it
shows the US giving in to nuclear blackmail. Other potential nuclear weapons
states will doubtless have noted the sort of concessions which can be wrung
from the US in return for giving up nuclear programmes. First Ukraine
receives a large aid package in return for agreeing to return its nuclear
warheads to Russia. Now North Korea collects for abandoning a nuclear
programme of unknown effectiveness. Who might be next?
Moreover, other countries in the region, from South Korea to Japan, will be
drawing their own lessons from the North Korean experience - not least
concerning the need to deter such threats in future. In the longer term, the
tension in the region remains.
If the value of the agreement is to stop a bad situation getting worse, are
there at least lessons which can be drawn to prevent a repetition of the
problem? One is that the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, up for renewal
next year, badly needs strengthening. The west should continue to honour the
NPT's original offer to make it attractive for countries to renounce the
bomb. At the same time it should step up efforts to prevent the flow of
critical technologies and nuclear fuels to rogue states tempted by nuclear
weapons. Proliferation may be inevitable in the long term, but the NPT still
has a valuable role to play in slowing its progress.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Flaws inherent in R&amp;D scoreboard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr ALAN SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I was pleased to see Dennis Henry's letter ('Added value should be real
value for R&amp;D', August 1) regarding his concerns about the recent
publication of the 'UK R&amp;D scoreboard'. This annual record is produced by
Company Reporting in conjunction with the Department of Trade and Industry
and takes data from company annual reports.
This is where the first problem arises; not all companies define R&amp;D in the
same way, despite the guidelines which are available to accountants
(Statement of Standard Accounting Practice).
Second, the amount of R&amp;D spend required by businesses within a particular
sector can vary. Some companies rely on impeccable service to generate high
profits, whereas others achieve the high profits through well planned R&amp;D.
Third, the tables are misleading in that some companies are much more
efficient in how they manage their R&amp;D projects than others. One company
spending 5 per cent of turnover on R&amp;D might be producing benefits equal to
a more efficient company spending only 1 per cent on R&amp;D. In the present
competitive environment it is essential to ensure that there is better
project selection and evaluation with continuous monitoring, followed by
assessment of the project's achievements.
Dennis Henry is right in looking at the ratio of R&amp;D to added-value rather
than to sales. The added-value which the R&amp;D brings to the company is what
is really important, but that is not something which can be measured easily
and quickly.
If the 'UK R&amp;D scoreboard' is going to encourage companies to spend more on
R&amp;D, then I fully support that. The best way to generate wealth for the
country is by being efficient technology leaders, who can move rapidly into
new markets.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Loved ones to exit the American way: US funeral operators
are targeting the UK for growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US company which laid to rest Elvis Presley, President J F Kennedy and
Howard Hughes could soon be transforming Britain's sombre, dark-curtained
parlours into brighter, breezier, money-spinning outlets.
The UK funeral industry may not seem an obvious site for takeover battles:
the death rate is falling steadily, and the depth of the recession has
forced the conservative British funeral purveyor to offer competitive
services.
But this gloomy picture of the UK sector has not deterred the two largest
funeral operators in North America from fighting for the UK's third-largest
funeral business, Great Southern Group. Last week, the victor, Service
Corporation International (SCI), also bought 3 per cent of the
second-largest UK funeral company, Plantsbrook.
Clearly the US operators see potential value in the businesses, which
inevitably spells change for the traditionally low-profile world of British
undertaking.
'I think the UK funeral business will change, because we will be there,'
says Mr Robert Waltrip, SCI's chairman who transformed the company from a
single family funeral parlour into the world's largest burier with 873
funeral homes.
SCI's aggressive strategy of acquiring some 700 US competitors over a period
of 30 years and applying economies of scale, has, in spite of declining
numbers of US customers, provided strong profits growth. Between 1989 and
1993, SCI's net profit doubled to Dollars 103m.
Mr Waltrip argues: 'Different nations have different religions, customs and
languages, but most civilised nations bury the dead with some kind of
ceremony. There is a place for a company like SCI worldwide.' He claims
SCI's experiences in the US, where it handles burials for a diverse ethnic
population from the Hispanic to the Jewish communities, equips it to spread
its services overseas.
But will he be able to translate the practices which Nancy Mitford satirised
so mercilessly in The American Way of Death into the less showy and
extravagant UK Way of Death? What may look to an outsider like an industry
which has lain moribund for centuries, has, in fact, been undergoing
something of a life-giving revolution over the past 10 years.
Until the 1980s, the UK funeral business was seen as a profession rather
than a business, a family concern passed down from father to son. But during
that decade a handful of operators became aware of the potential for
economies of scale in the industry. A funeral home has to carry large fixed
costs such as hearses, embalming facilities and attendants. All of them are
only periodically busy.
UK companies recognised that they could reap enormous benefits from building
up so-called 'clusters' - central facilities for hearses and attendants - to
service a large group of funeral homes. At the same time, given the goodwill
attached to small family businesses, their names and shop frontages could be
retained.
Soon, the frock-coats gave way to the pinstripes as businessmen such as Mr
Howard Hodgson and Mr Michael Kenyon, two of the foremost UK funeral
operators, pursued aggressive strategies to shake up the ranks of Britain's
independent funeral concerns. Hodgson Holdings, a Birmingham-based listed
company, bought several hundred independent funeral homes between mid-1986
and mid-1989, spending close to Pounds 40m on acquisitions.
Mr Hodgson's buying spree was typical of the transformation taking place in
the industry. As a result of the upheaval, almost 40 per cent of the UK's
funeral business is today owned by three operators: Great Southern (5 per
cent), Plantsbrook (9 per cent), and the Co-operative movement (25 per
cent).
By comparison, the three big players in the US, which also include Loewen
Group and Stewart Enterprises, share 16 per cent of the far larger North
American market; and the share is rising. SCI spent Dollars 175m on US
acquisitions in the first half of this year alone, and now controls 9 per
cent of the market.
SCI and other US funeral companies benefit from a US regulatory regime which
creates barriers to entry to any potential competitor, including foreign
operators, by laying down tough licensing requirements.
In the UK, by contrast, there are no barriers to entry in what is a 'people
business': overseas corporate raiders face the threat of top employees from
target companies setting up rival businesses overnight.
But this has not deterred SCI, which wants to take an ever-bigger slice of
the UK trade through its new UK arm, Great Southern.
'If I was in the private sector, I would be delighted at this (move by
SCI),' said Mr Hodgson. 'Independent operators will either win funerals by
saying to customers, 'Do you want your mother to be buried by a Texas
cowboy?' or they will be offered more money (by US rivals) for their
companies.'
During the 1980s, Hodgson Holdings' aggressive takeover actions
substantially drove up the prices of funeral homes. Mr Hodgson argues that
SCI could be forced to pay similarly inflated prices for small, independent
funeral homes as it builds up its UK presence.
American funeral operators justify the high prices paid for UK rivals by
pointing out that they will achieve greater operating efficiencies. SCI, for
instance, says its principle of 'clusters' could easily be applied to
inefficient UK family-run funeral operators.
Besides exaggerated prices for parlours, operators face the broader problem
of a falling UK death rate. For the past two decades the rate has fluctuated
at 650,000 deaths a year, but is expected to continue its recent decline,
falling by 3,000 to 626,000 in the year to June 1995.
The Government Actuary, which projects births and deaths, is forecasting
further declines to about 600,000 in 2010 when the deaths of the first of
the so-called 'baby boomers' should provide a turnaround in the trend. By
2052, the death rate is forecast to peak at about 829,000 a year. For those
in the funeral business, it is a long wait.
But operators can use the intervening years to convince traditionally
conservative British consumers to change their habits. First, they could
persuade customers to choose more expensive caskets, rather than the plain
coffins which, even at the top of the range, cost about Pounds 800.
Americans routinely pay about Dollars 4,000 for a normal burial. In
addition, 70 per cent of the UK population chooses cremation over burial -
which is even cheaper.
UK operators remain sceptical about SCI's hopes of narrowing the gap in
spending between the two countries. But the US group points to its
experiences in Australia, where it invested USDollars 102m in the
acquisition of Pine Grove Funeral Group in July 1993. Since then it has
maintained prices for merchandise while doubling the range of coffins. The
result has been a 40 per cent increase at some homes in the average spend
per funeral in the past year.
'We will never attempt to Americanise any country's customs,' says Mr
Waltrip. 'We will just apply the same business concepts as we use in America
such as 'clustering'. We would be crazy to change several hundred years of
custom.'
But he would like to sell more Dollars 95,000 caskets - like the one in
which Elvis was buried.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Ballot box blarney: An 'either-or' choice will not solve the
conflict in N Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If one thing is now clear about the conflict in Northern Ireland, it is that
the Irish nationalists are deeply divided over how to respond to last
December's peace proposals, put forward by the British and Irish governments
in their joint Downing Street declaration. Formally, Sinn Fein, the
republican political movement, last month appeared to reject the Anglo-Irish
overture, and terrorist attacks have continued. But all recent statements by
Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, have suggested that he personally is
more in favour of peace than war, and has recommended a ceasefire by the
IRA.
According to a recent editorial in the Irish Times, 'a great body of
informed opinion now agrees that the provisional IRA will shortly call
another cease-fire in the North'. But the paper concluded gloomily that any
ceasefire would be unlikely to last, since the IRA was still hoping for
peace on its terms; in other words it was still hoping for total victory.
There was little evidence so far that the IRA would settle for peace on the
terms offered, which was a peace of compromise and consent, without winners
and without losers.
The difficulty for the terrorists - and the problem is the same for the IRA
as for its extremist counterparts in the Protestant community - is that the
Anglo-Irish declaration is deliberately couched in terms designed to shut
out a victory by either side. It speaks sympathetically of the principle of
self-determination, but makes clear that this principle will be enacted only
through a process of democratic consent. If the nationalists and the
Catholics in the province want Northern Ireland to become part of a united
Ireland, they must persuade the Protestants and the rest of the population
in Northern Ireland of their case, and get it accepted through the ballot
box.
The problem with the declaration is that the terms as stated are either
wholly disingenuous or deliberately deceptive. In it, the British government
says that it has 'no selfish strategic or economic interest in Northern
Ireland', and will uphold 'the democratic wish of a greater number of people
of Northern Ireland on the issue of whether they prefer to support the Union
or a sovereign united Ireland'.
On the face of it, such a position is democratic, statesmanlike,
unexceptionable. In fact, it appears to bear little relation to a province
which is the product of an Anglo-Irish conflict at least 400 years old, and
which has been racked by terrorism from both sides for a quarter of a
century.
For the moment, the Protestants are in a clear majority, and it is obvious
that, if a plebiscite were held now on the future of the province, it would
go in favour of continued membership of the United Kingdom. But the
Protestants' share of the population is declining relative to the
Catholics', and this causes them profound anxiety; if a similar plebiscite
were held in a few decades, it might go in favour of a united Ireland.
But these two innocent and contrasting scenarios bear no relationship to the
reality that Northern Ireland has lived through for the past 25 years. The
idea that there can be a simple 'either-or' choice for the future of the
province, which could be settled peacefully and definitively by a majority
vote, is a fairy tale. The reason for IRA terrorism is that a tiny minority
of the minority community does not accept the will of the majority or the
legitimacy of the present constitutional position, and is prepared to kill
and maim to overthrow it. But a tiny minority of the majority community is
also prepared to kill and maim to uphold the present constitutional
arrangement.
In other words, the one thing missing from Northern Ireland is the principle
of democratic consent, which means acceptance of the will of the majority.
And since the province is nearly equally divided between two opposing
communities, any question which pits them against each other will have the
smallest chance of gaining general democratic consent. So if the question
which is supposed to be addressed by the Anglo-Irish declaration is the
either-or choice between the United Kingdom and a united Ireland, we can be
fairly sure that there is no chance of a peaceful decision through the
ballot box.
Some people maintain that the British government's apparent indifference to
the constitutional destiny of Northern Ireland, provided it is settled
democratically, could have the perverse effect of provoking terrorism. For
if the UK government really does not care whether Northern Ireland stays or
goes, maybe the terrorists have more leverage. I am not sure I go this far.
But it is nevertheless rather extraordinary that one of the oldest nation
states in Europe should profess disinterest in hanging on to one of its
provinces.
It is, by contrast, inconceivable that any French government should disclaim
any 'selfish strategic or economic interest' in Alsace-Lorraine; and just as
inconceivable that any Spanish government should shrug off the destiny of
Catalonia or the Basque country. On the contrary, they would rule out, as a
matter of principle, any amputation of their territory as an outrage to
national sovereignty.
Some who think the declaration dangerously provocative would argue that the
British government ought to rule out, for ever, any change in the formal
constitutional attachment of Northern Ireland. Again, I would not go that
far. But since it is almost inconceivable that there could be a peaceful
constitutional settlement through a simple majority vote, it seems reckless
to indulge in loose talk about 'self-determination' and 'consent', when the
first is inapplicable and the second is unavailable.

Sir, In your item on the abandonment of the Pacific Zinc project at
Hachinohe, Japan ('Japan zinc project is abandoned', August 10) it was
stated that the imperial smelting process was developed in Australia. In
fact the process was developed by our then parent company, Imperial Smelting
Corporation, at Avonmouth, UK, and is now in use in 11 countries including
Australia. It is used in Japan at the existing zinc smelter at Hachinohe and
by Sumitomo Metal Mining at its Harima smelter.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Drivers are not diverted by motorway
tolls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From D B HARLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, One despairs of the intelligence of members of the 'Tory-dominated'
Commons transport committee ('Tories attack motorway toll plans', August 13)
if they delude themselves that 20 to 30 per cent of motorists in the UK
would divert from motorways if tolls were charged.
Motorway charges have been in force in France, Spain, Italy and other
countries since the inception. In Germany, where charges are likely to be
introduced soon, the idea of motorists shunning the autobahns is held to be
absurd.
If this committee wants some hard evidence, let it look at Switzerland where
charges were introduced in the 1980s after years of toll-free use. A simple
windscreen sticker costing SFr30 (Pounds 15) annually and available at all
garages and post offices does the trick, with an on-the-spot fine as
deterrent if you are caught using the motorways without one. No Swiss driver
in his or her right mind diverts to 'local roads', and I am sure the British
motorist is equally capable of calculating cost versus convenience.
Such a system in the UK would yield ample funds for whatever purpose. As for
the committee's rather inane suggestion of 'increasing fuel' duties instead,
the extra tax would merely disappear in the Treasury maw and add yet another
turn of the screw to the government's unpopularity.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Arts: The case for controversial views - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British, it is said, are masters of compromise. Look at their
parliamentary system: they set up one lot of people to run the government
and another lot to oppose them. The legal system provides for adversaries,
insisting that the state not only prosecute the accused but argue his
defence with equal rigour. Underlying such systems is the belief that, where
matters of ethics and fine judgment are concerned, you may come close to the
truth by listening to different opinions.
There is a similar value in the diversity of opinion within journalism. Yet
whereas we are fairly comfortable with the notion of all sorts of extreme
attitudes in print, there is still widespread anxiety when such attitudes
are expressed on television. Journalists whose work causes little more than
minor controversy in print - John Pilger, say, or Auberon Waugh - can cause
an outcry when they offer the same thoughts on television.
Assertions that the carpet bombing of German cities in the second world war
was a pretty nasty and not very cost effective policy, that Bomber Harris
was aggressive and not the most compassionate of men, or that victory in the
Pacific might have been achieved by showing evidence of the power of the
A-bomb to the Japanese rather than dropping it on Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
are not new. They have appeared frequently in print without causing untoward
outrage. Repeat them on television, however, and a lot of people get very
upset.
Perhaps this is partly because more people watch television than read
serious journalism, but I suspect it is also because television is not seen
as a medium of opinion in the same way as print. A viewer may not himself be
persuaded by the programme that Harris was a brutal, uncaring man, yet may
worry because he believes others will be swayed by television; by the
perception that this is historical fact rather than nuance or even eccentric
theorising of the sort you find so often in print.
Such was the hostility to Channel 4's screening of a programme about Bomber
Command in the Canadian series The Valour And The Horror that Right To Reply
was recalled from its summer recess to mount a special edition devoted
exclusively to the topic. Defenders of Bomber Command made a number of
telling points (all your research is thrown into question if you claim a
man's nickname was 'Butcher' when it was actually 'Butch') but in the end
Right To Reply's greatest success was in revealing the virtue on both sides.
The older men, with memories of so many dead comrades, were surely right to
be furious at seeing their own side pilloried when they had done what had to
be done - in the heat of war - to overcome the vileness of Nazism. The
younger men were surely right to question the ethics of fighting vileness if
it involves becoming vile.
Hoping that the veterans will welcome critical reinterpretations of the war,
on the grounds that it was precisely this sort of freedom they were supposed
to have fought for, is a bit much perhaps. However, there is no great virtue
in championing 'free speech' if that merely means the freedom to say things
with which you agree. If it is not to be an empty boast, then free speech
must mean the right of someone such as Kenneth Griffith to present a
programme such as Hang Up Your Brightest Colours, his celebration of the
life of IRA leader Michael Collins which waited 21 years for a network
screening. BBC2 showed it on Saturday as part of their '25 Bloody Years'
series on the Irish troubles. In 1973 Lew Grade, then head of ATV,
suppressed the programme because he felt it sympathised too openly with
Irish republicanism.
But this programme, surely, is the equivalent of the argument from the
opposition, the case for the defence, the component which the formal system
of adversary attitudes insists we should understand so that we can come to a
proper appreciation of the broader picture. Yet the powers that be - whether
Grade or the BBC governors who so cravenly suppressed Real Lives: At The
Edge Of The Union, or the government - repeatedly insult our intelligence by
imposing bans on programme material which they think will bamboozle us even
though it fails to sway them. (Had Griffith's film converted Grade he would
presumably have wanted to screen it.) It is perfectly possible to admire
Griffith's extraordinary talent, even to share some of his admiration for
Collins, and yet to go on loathing and despising the methods of the IRA.
The awful thing is that, whatever the subject, television does so pitifully
little in this business of portraying all sides. Richard Dawkins had half an
hour on Channel 4 on Monday in The Vision Thing to explain not just why he
is not religious but why he believes religion is an undesirable phenomenon.
Given the scarcity of religious belief among most of the broadcasting people
I have ever met, it is odd that such programmes should be astoundingly
unusual compared with the countless series packed with stained glass,
choirboys and hymns.
Heretic on BBC2, about men who have been ostracised by the scientific
community because of their unfashionable ideas, has made a nice change from
the usual two schools of science on television, 'Gee whiz]' and 'Oh dear'.
But series such as Heretic are rare indeed.
Television news programmes offer a sequence of remarkably similar versions
of events. The topics covered in the Daily Telegraph and The Guardian are
also similar, but the perception of the world communicated to the reader
differs greatly because of the different ways in which items are approached
and the different weight given to constituents. Swap round the presenters in
the television news programmes and most viewers would not be able to tell
the difference between the programmes.
Possibly the most depressing is television's arts coverage. Apart from
occasional items in Channel 4's Without Walls practically all the material
in this area is coated uniformly in the varnish of 1960s modernism. Seen in
newspaper terms, virtually all television arts programmes take a
Guardian/Observer approach. There may be occasional panellists from The
Modern Review or The Spectator but the programmes are still made under
Guardian/Observer assumptions. Moreover, the new technologies - satellite,
cable, cassette, whatever - show few signs of increasing the array in such
matters as the arts and history, even if we do now have Sky News. What
television needs is not fewer but more passionate extremists - from all
extremes.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Arts: The Seven Streams of the River Ota - Edinburgh
Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nietzsche famously compared Wagner's music with the heartbeat of a slug. The
comparison occurs throughout Robert Lepage's production of The Seven Streams
of the River Ota in its world premiere production at Edinburgh's Meadowbank
Sports Centre. Teething troubles in rehearsal and changes up to the last
minute suggest that tightening and sharpening are still possibilities.
Certainly this ambitious triptych represents slender substance monumentally
swamped by style. Slowness is less a matter of pace than focus and rhythm,
both of which are as yet lacking.
Though the piece's conception is attributed to the largely French-Canadian
company, Lepage is both director and designer, so must take responsibility
for the priorities (visual over narrative) that deaden the theatrical
impact. This is all the more tantalising when one remembers his production
of the the opera double-bill, Erwartung and Bluebeard's Castle, that was
rightly the hit of last year's Edinburgh Festival. But then a musical score
imposes its own time limits and emotional climaxes.
Seven Streams opens with young Pierre arriving in Hiroshima to study
calligraphy. He finds lodgings with the laconic Jana, misses his
girl-friend, meets Jana's operatic soprano acquaintance (and possibly
lover), and tumbles to the fact that Walter from the Canadian consulate is a
philandering lecher. The dialogue is less spare than stilted, thanks to the
cast's variable command of English; and the puppet prologue that recounts
the accidental discovery of gunpowder by herbalists seeking an aphrodisiac
for an aged emperor strikes the production's keynote of exquisite
portentousness.
The central act focuses on Jana: Czech, Jewish, at the age of 11 she is in
Theresienstadt - Terezin, that transit camp that the Nazis made a showcase
for writers, artists and performers for the benefit of the Red Cross and the
world's newsreels. She befriends an opera singer who hangs herself after
heavily hinting at parallels with Madam Butterfly. Escaping the death camps,
the adult Jana finds herself in Bohemian squalor in a brave new
transatlantic world. After dabbling in pornography and drugs she meets, by
an amazing coincidence, the daughter of the dead opera-singer, herself a
soprano.
The play's third section returns to the present. The attempt to tie up loose
ends overlooks the fact that the ends themselves are not attached to
anything. The sudden switch to backstage bitchiness (Pierre's actress
girlfriend arrives on tour) and French bedroom farce (coupling on the
rebound) leaves us cold since nothing in the previous three and a half hours
has made us like or believe in these lifelessly manipulated pawns.
Attempts to add depth and resonance - the present-day action is set in
Hiroshima, 'city of catastrophe and survival'; the visiting theatre company
performs a great chunk of Mishima's Madame de Sade - further clog the work's
texture; and Lepage's preoccupation with cultural cross-fertilisation
diffuses rather than concentrates. There remains the visual element:
Japanese sliding walls, film projections, layered mirrors that send their
images into infinity - none notably remedying the lack of urgency and
tenuous dramatic thread.
The programme lists the company without allocating roles. Interesting to see
Rebecca Blankenship, the soprano from last year's Erwartung, bring a Jerry
Hall elegance to both singers, squally in Dvorak and propulsive in Puccini.
The younger Jana (Marie Brassard) is touching, the older one stalks dumpily
around in dark glasses like Bette Davis OD-ing on carbo-hydrates.
Sponsorship by Beck's suggests consolation in the two intervals.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Arts: The Glory of Gershwin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER ASPDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Larry Adler used to hang out with George Gershwin, the two men were
summoned by the vampish French actress Simone Simon to have dinner with her.
Both besotted, they failed to understand how their glamorous companion could
be so cruel as to make them compete in front of her - until her ulterior
motive became clear: 'She just wanted to hear us play together.'
Adler, opening a week of concerts celebrating his old friend's music,
declined to reveal the extent of his disappointment, but Simon surely got
the best deal. There is a strong symbiosis between Gershwin's luscious
melodies and the warm, expressive playing of Adler, celebrating his 80th
birthday with a truly unlikely excursion into the pop charts with his 'The
Glory of Gershwin'.
What most of the artists on that compilation found, however, is that the
effortless sweep of the music is not as easily achieved as it sounds; very
few singers can handle the delicate and always-humorous phrasing demanded by
'S'wonderful' or 'Fascinating Rhythm' while also coping with the much more
intense requirements of Porgy and Bess. At the Jazz Cafe, Issy van Randwyck
showed complete control of the former art, while her partner Clive Rowe
excelled at the latter, particularly in a powerful 'There's a Boat Dat's
Leavin' Soon for New York'. When the two got together, as in a joyful 'I Got
Rhythm', there was enough energy and theatre to put aside reservations over
technique.
Adler himself beamed, cajoled and basked his way through the highly
enjoyable evening. He saved himself for a rousing Rhapsody in Blue, in which
his duet with a 'ghost' of Gershwin at the piano was genuinely affecting. No
wonder so many of those dinner dates ended up a trois.
Larry Adler: 'The Glory of Gershwin' at the Jazz Cafe until August 20.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Arts: Beer, bonhomie and bebop - Brecon Jazz Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At 8:30 on Friday evening, at the same time as I was pressing between the
ranks of Krukke, the Dutch marching band, to gain assess to the Guildhall
and the Human Chain within, octogenarian altoist Benny Carter was preparing
to join Saxomania in the Market Hall. Meanwhile, swinging bassist Ray Brown
was already warming up a trio in Christ College. Across town, the open air
bandstands emanated a mixture of trad, mainstream and the smell of myriad
griddles. Two hours old and Brecon Jazz was already cooking. In prospect was
a feast of attractions including Slide Hampton, George Shearing and Jon
Faddis as well as a packed 'stroller' programme with gems like tenorist Andy
Hamilton or clarinettist Kenny Daverne teamed with trumpeter Warren Vache.
The cleverly contrived anarchy of Django Bates' small band set the tone well
for the fringe aspect of the best little festival in the UK. Bates himself
alternated crazily between peck horn and trashy sounding electric keyboard,
his quartet's eccentric sound describing a tableau of circus and music hall
quirkiness. Frenetic songs with titles like 'Food For Plankton' and 'Dancing
on Frith St' were tossed between saxophonist Iain Bellamy and the leader
making a delicious musical nonsense from the clouds of notes and manic
rhythmic complexity.
On Saturday afternoon the same space was filled with the exhilarating sound
and spectacle of the Trevor Watts Moire Music Drum Orchestra. Consisting of
a battery of Ghanaian traditional drums, a supercharged but otherwise
straight kit, a bubbling fretless bass and an unstoppable soprano sax, the
orchestra was an overflowing cauldron of colourful energy.
For two blissful hours waves of percussive patterns flowed from congas and
djembe, carried on rolling basslines. Weaving a continuous line of
improvisation throughout, Watts remained seated and serene behind white
beard and granny specs. The counterpoint of mbira thumb pianos and
crisscrossing of flute with soprano sax in Ghanaian folk tunes was exquisite
and the booming version of Rocky Road to Dublin, quite extraordinary.
A couple of hours' interval to munch a taco accompanied by the flamenco
washed guitar of Eduardo Niebla at the Museum Car Park bandstand was all
that was needed to make the geographical leap from West Africa to the US,
via Panama. Assembled in the Market Hall was the New York Latin Jazz
Allstars led by pianist Danilo Perez. Directed by Perez and propelled by
Ignacio Berroa (drums) and Larry Grenadier (bass), ace Cuban altoist Paquito
D'Rivera, Brazilian trumpeter - Claudio Roditi and rising young tenor star
David Sanchez picked up where Dizzy Gillespie's UN Big Band left off.
Battling with BBC technicians for attention (the view of the music was
obscured by three cameramen and a constantly swinging 25ft jib which some of
the audience found hard to take), the Allstars won through, but only just,
with spreading rhythms and radiant solos from the leaders.
Guitarist Jim Hall, appearing in the tranquil setting of the Christ College
theatre, had no such interference. So distilled is the guitarist's technique
and so pure the semi-acoustic sound that on such a day - long and full of
hot jazz - he might have trod the wrong side of the thin line between
elevation and enervation. But, first in duet with protege Peter Bernstein
and then unobtrusively backed by Allan Ganley (drums) and Dave Green (bass),
Hall applied his understated and intimate technique to a series of
shimmering pieces from Lunceford to Gilberto and finally his old boss
Rollins.
Outside, in the sunshine, Brecon continued to boil over with beer, bonhomie
and bebop. Roll on next August.

Why do international sports authorities not present gold medals for cha cha
or the military two step? After all you can win medals for dancing on ice
and even for dancing horses. And now, we are assured, the great passion all
over Britain is for 'synchronised swimming', where you put a clothes peg on
your nose, stick your head under water, and waggle your posterior in time to
the music. Short Stories watches Hayley, 10, and Victoria, 13, as they
practise (8.30 C4). Hard to believe that Anna Reynolds' first television
drama can be as poignant as the news story upon which it is based. A Belgian
family of four locked their car in the garage and themselves in the cellar
and stayed there for a fortnight to avoid the social stigma of not being
able to afford a summer holiday. 'Paradise' in the BBC2 studio drama series
Stages uses exactly that plot (9.25). After building a camera into the
cricket stumps there was nowhere really important left to go but BBC1 makes
an effort by sending a miniature camera up the vagina during the episode on
sex in Desmond Morris's The Human Animal (9.30).

FT  17 AUG 94 / Management: The price police - The sleuthing skills of the
EC's competition division
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was more than 200 years ago that Adam Smith, the classical economist,
penned his famous dictum that 'people of the same trade seldom meet
together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a
conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices'.
Several examples during the past decade suggest that his comment is as valid
now as then. Last month a group of carton-board producers were fined record
sums after forming what the EC described as Europe's 'most pernicious'
price-fixing cartel.
The meetings of the 'massive' 19-strong cartel were disguised as social
events of an ostensibly legitimate association known as the Product Group
Paperboard. These meetings usually took place in Swiss hotels, and
occasionally in Nice or Barcelona, to lend credence to the idea of a social
gathering.
In 1987 a group of North Sea supply boat operators were accused of running a
price-fixing cartel, known as the Coffee Club because its alleged meetings
took place in the guise of coffee mornings.
At about the same time, a group of Manchester glass merchants were meeting
in private rooms in airport hotels to agree prices. A few years earlier a
pub in Newbury, Berkshire was the meeting point for managers employed by
some of Britain's biggest concrete companies who used to discuss how to
carve up markets in neighbouring Oxfordshire.
As well as proving Smith's point, these cases illustrate a central problem
facing the competition authorities. Although there may be ample grounds for
suspicion, how can they prove that companies have agreed to rig the market?
If people from the same industry discuss illicit agreements at, say, a trade
association meeting or an industry conference, what proof is there that the
law has been infringed?
Interviewing staff or examining documents seized after unannounced
inspections of companies may yield incriminating evidence. In some
instances, carelessness may play into the officials' hands - for example,
documents about a PVC cartel were left on an office window sill by an
employee of ICI, the UK chemicals group.
Frequently, however, it requires the skills of a sleuth to prove that
illegal price-fixing has actually taken place. Many cartels cover their
tracks effectively. The carton-board producers, for example, concealed their
activities by drawing up bogus minutes of meetings.
'It is extremely difficult to get evidence of any collusion,' says one
observer. He likens the problems faced by the European Commission's
competition division to those of the US agents who managed to bring down Al
Capone, the Chicago gangster, on tax evasion.
Not surprisingly, trade associations can be a focus of suspicion for
competition authorities. In many cases the origins of trade associations lie
in the enforcement of price-setting agreements, in the years when they were
legal. To a suspicious eye, the associations still provide a convenient
cover to discuss pricing.
'It is clear that the Commission has a jaundiced view of trade
associations,' says one association official. 'They believe that an
organisation which exists to promote that industry has the capacity to
orchestrate the things that go on.'
He adds, however, that in many ways trade associations are unlikely media
for cartels. 'The last thing that companies want is a trade association
official being there. If they were going to do anything they would do it on
the telephone.'
The subject of pricing is particularly likely to crop up in commodity-type
industries. Ian Blakey of the British Iron &amp; Steel Producers Association
says it is sometimes necessary to stop conversation drifting towards the
subject of price. 'You have to be strict with the members. You can talk
about market conditions but discussion of prices is not on. People know the
rules.'
Frequently, however, it is not flagrant discussion of prices that causes the
problems. Trade associations can run into difficulties by exchanging
statistics, selling products overseas collectively and establishing industry
standards.
The exchange of statistics has proved a thorny issue for the Agricultural
Engineers Association. In 1989 the European Commission took exception to its
system of collating and supplying information on UK tractor registrations.
An appeal concerning the Commission's decision is due to be concluded next
month.
The Commission said that the system revealed too much detailed competitive
information. However, some tractor makers believe that the Commission's real
concern about associations' statistical systems is that they are a way for
an industry to police the workings of a cartel. If the Commission wins the
appeal case, it is thought possible that it will take action against the
statistical systems run by some 22 other trade associations.
The wide scope of the competition authorities' interests demonstrated by
this example shows that it may be possible to get unwittingly into
difficulties. That raises problems for associations and companies alike.
There are pitfalls for the unwary. Senior executives may be unaware of what
their subordinates are doing. 'It can be middle management who unbeknownst
to the board get the firm into difficulty,' says Sue Hankey of lawyers
Cameron Markby &amp; Hewitt.
The excuse is sometimes ignorance. Not everyone realises, for example, that
the exchange of information between competitors is illegal. 'A problem with
sales people is they don't always realise they are infringing any
legislation,' says Richard Spiller of lawyers D. J. Freeman.
But the competition authorities are not impressed by pleadings of innocence.
Companies need to show they have done everything possible to comply with
competition law. Smiths Concrete, accused of taking part in a concrete
cartel, appealed successfully against a fine on the grounds that it had
taken all reasonable steps to prevent staff from taking part in unlawful
agreements.
The heavy fines imposed by the Commission, which has the power to fine
offenders up to 10 per cent of their worldwide annual turnover, has
concentrated the minds of senior management on these issues. Organisations
increasingly feel the need to be seen to comply with both the letter and the
spirit of competition law.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Management: Aesop's business legacy - Why business schools
use modern parables to teach their students
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FURNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Organisations, like individuals, have one thing in common: they are all
different. Each company is unique even if its products are not.
If this is true, why do students of business try to learn from case studies?
Can general principles be grasped by looking at unique examples? Are case
histories just entertaining stories of business success and failure or the
Aesop's fables of the 20th century?
Business experts and textbook authors are aware of the appeal of the case
history. With the zeal of an evangelical preacher, US business gurus such as
Tom Peters tell stories of how, often by making the most simple changes,
organisations were saved from bankruptcy and their employees from
redundancy.
Less attractive, perhaps, are the smug autobiographies by millionaires
recounting their own 'tea-boy to managing director' tale.
Many best-selling business books are simply a catalogue of interesting and
unusual case histories which are used to illustrate a specific point.
Business textbooks also often use case studies to illustrate what they
teach.
For scientists and social scientists alike, the idea of teaching by parable
is bizarre. Does management science have no facts, formulae or theories
which can be taught by conventional methods? Physics and mathematics have
their axioms; but the principles of management science are constantly
changing.
Advocates of teaching with case histories argue that the system has specific
benefits. First, case studies are realistic and highly relevant. They are
not abstract and not based on jargon. Students can easily identify with the
everyday examples from the real world. Second, the stories are much more
memorable than dry formulae.
Third, and perhaps paradoxically, the ambiguities in a business case study
can be its strength as a learning tool. Just as biblical parables have kept
theologians busy for two millennia with arguments about the precise meaning
of a story, so the case study encourages participation by provoking
different interpretations and points of view. Alternative insights,
solutions and implications can be evaluated and debated.
The case study's complexity makes it difficult to analyse exhaustively, and
in this sense it mirrors the real business problems the students will
confront later in their careers.
Finally, students using case histories not only have to generate different
interpretations but they have to argue and compete for their perspective. In
this way this method of teaching can help develop an ability to marshall
evidence in support of a particular explanation.
Critics of the case study approach to teaching see management science as
having no facts or theories.
What they forget is that medical students - for better or worse - use case
studies for all the above reasons. It could be argued that lawyers are
educated exclusively through the case study. Business people, like lawyers,
are encouraged to draw abstract principles from specific case histories.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Business and the Environment: Sparks fly over electric cars
 -Battery-operated vehicles may not be as clean as originally thought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While the US automobile industry scrambles to meet 1998 deadlines to put
electric vehicles on the market, controversy about the environmental
benefits and commercial viability of battery-operated cars is mounting.
Circumstances in the US increasingly favour the electric car. Air quality
laws in California and Massachusetts now demand that 'zero-emission'
vehicles comprise 2 per cent of total sales in the car market by 1998.
Electric cars are the only vehicles to meet such standards so far. Other
states are considering similar laws.
Yet the big three car manufacturers - Ford, Chrysler and General Motors -
have complained bitterly during the last few months that a deadline of 1998
is unrealistic and that environmental benefits from the vehicles are
ill-defined. Several environmental organisations have concurred.
In April, a leaked report by the US Environmental Protection Agency
questioned the air quality improvements from battery-operated cars, lending
credence to electric car critics. 'Electric vehicles will not have a
positive environmental benefit across the country,' says Stephen Burrington,
a lawyer with environmental advocacy group the Conservation Law Foundation.
Many ecologists complain that the term 'zero-emission' vehicle is wishful
thinking when applied to electric cars. The emissions are still there, they
argue, whether they emanate from the electric power plant or from the car
itself.
According to the EPA report, switching to electric vehicles may not always
improve air quality as these cars increase electricity consumption. Benefits
are, therefore, uneven. Regions relying on 'cleaner' electricity sources,
such as nuclear and hydro-electric plants and natural gas, for their energy
will probably fare better than regions depending on more traditional power
sources such as oil and coal.
'The switch to electric vehicles could be disastrous for a state like
Kentucky, which still gets a lot of its electricity from coal,' says Robert
Russell, a lawyer for the Conservation Law Foundation.
Most people involved in the debate agree that electric car use in California
would almost certainly improve air quality there.
'California is an exception, first because it has so many clean energy
sources such as wind power, and second because its electricity sources are
separated by mountains from the cities which have air quality problems, like
Los Angeles,' says Reginald Modlin, Chrysler's manager of environmental
energy affairs.
There the consensus stops. The EPA and NESCAUM, the north-eastern air
quality organisation, believe the north-east of the country, which generates
much of its energy through nuclear power, could also benefit from electric
vehicles.
The car industry disagrees. 'Our studies show that the north-east would not
get any improvement in air quality with a switch to electric vehicles,' says
Modlin.
John Williams, chairman of the US Advanced Battery Consortium at General
Motors, also points out that electric cars are less efficient in the
north-east than they are in California. 'The cold in the north-east hurts
our range,' he explains. 'We can get 70-90 miles in moderate temperatures,
but only 30 miles in freezing conditions.'
Enthusiasts say that studies questioning environmental benefits assume a
lower efficiency than they should for electric cars. 'Old gas-burning cars
normally see a dramatic increase in emissions as they get older,' says
William Sessa, a spokesman for the California Air Resources Board. 'Electric
cars don't see this deterioration. After 100,000 miles of driving, they are
pretty much the same as brand new in terms of emissions.'
Some environmentalists believe electric vehicle efficiency is
over-estimated. 'Getting the energy from the power source to storage, from
the storage to the car, is extremely inefficient,' says Burrington.
Environmental improvements may largely depend on how strictly emissions from
electricity sources are controlled. California's rigid pollution standards
mean that it would reap more benefits than other states. In the long run,
moreover, it may be easier to limit pollution from the electric plants than
from individual cars.
Emissions, however, are only part of the overall impact, say
environmentalists. 'Even if the sources are cleaner, if electric use
increases, it can cause ecological problems,' says Thomas Caffrey, an
engineer with the EPA. 'There are other environmental problems involved with
sources like hydro-electric and nuclear. Hydro-electric power has been very
much criticised lately for what it can do to fish and other water species.'
Russell contends, moreover, that the issue cannot be studied on a
region-to-region basis. 'Cars are marketed widely and cross state boundaries
readily, so we need to look at this on a federal level.'
Environmentalists also worry that electric cars will encourage Americans to
be complacent about their driving habits. 'What we need is an overall
reduction in car use in this country,' says Burrington.
Despite the criticism, electric cars seem poised to represent part of the
car market by 1998. Car manufacturers say they can meet the state-imposed
deadlines, although battery technology cannot yet offer the vehicles at
competitive prices.
The air-quality boards for California and the north-eastern states say they
will forge ahead with plans to encourage electric car use. 'With the smog
problems we face in California, we have no choice,' says Sessa. 'We have to
look at alternatives like electric vehicles. They may not be perfect, but
they're certainly an improvement over what we have.'

FT  17 AUG 94 / Management: European Case of the Year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Insead and IMD, the Continent's leading business schools, have dominated
1994's European Case of the Year Awards.
These bouquets are handed out by the European Case Clearing House, the
world's biggest source of management case study material with offices at
Cranfield University in the UK and Babson College in the US.
Decided by the number of new users of each case study - considered a more
objective method than a panel of judges - the awards acknowledge the
contribution of the growing band of European authors. European schools are
often criticised for relying too heavily on North American case material.
This year's overall winner, for the second time in the four-year history of
the event, was Sumantra Ghoshal of Insead (who has recently been appointed
to a new chair at the London Business School). Written in 1992, his case
concerns the special problems and challenges of managing a professional
service firm (Andersen Consulting Europe).
Presentations were made to the 12 authors of the most successful case
studies in six management sub-categories (accounting, control and business
environment; finance; policy and general management; human
resources/organisational behaviour; marketing; production and operations
management). Insead achieved three category winners, IMD two category
winners and four runners-up.
The only UK success was Andrew Brown of Nottingham University (previously of
Manchester Business School) who triumphed in the Policy and General
Management section for his study of managing change in Britain's National
Health Service.
'Cases don't attract the same attention as scholarly research even though
they require a lot of work and skill,' says Jeff Gray, director of ECCH.
'That is why it is important to have a mechanism for recognising them.'
ECCH, set up in 1973, is a non-profit company with charitable status and 325
member organisations. It gathers case materials from worldwide sources - it
now has 13,000 titles spanning all aspects of management - and provides
facilities for their selection and examination.
Apart from business schools, Gray says that the ECCH attracts companies and
firms such as IBM, Shell and Ernst &amp; Young with their own management
development activities.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Business and the Environment: Watch on the Danube - A look
at Romania's bid to save a damaged delta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The World Bank is this month due to grant Romania Dollars 4.5m (Pounds 3m)
to help preserve the Danube delta, Europe's largest remaining wetland and
one of its most important wildlife sanctuaries, which is under increasing
threat from industrial pollution.
After years of mismanagement under Romania's former communist regime, the
delta's unique ecosystems are being destroyed by the pollutants and waste
accumulated by the River Danube on its 2,700km journey through the
industrial heartland of Europe.
The delta covers 580,000ha in eastern Romania and southern Ukraine where the
Danube splits into three main branches and enters the Black Sea.
For centuries, it has provided a sanctuary for rare birds, fish and
wildlife, as well as for persecuted human beings.
It is home to more than 75 species of fish, rare mammals such as the
European mink and wild cat, and an estimated 300 species of birds including
Dalmatian pelicans, pygmy cormorants, red-breasted geese, glossy ibis and
several kinds of egret and heron.
Its few thousand human inhabitants are mainly descendants of ethnic
Ukrainians and Russians driven out of tsarist Russia in the 17th and 18th
centuries because of their religious beliefs. In 1991, Unesco (the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation) added the delta
to its World Heritage list.
But the region is more than just an area of beauty and environmental
interest.
'The delta is a natural buffer between the Danube and the Black Sea,' says
Irina Luca, project officer for the World Bank in Bucharest.
'Its vegetation filters out pollutants and purifies water from the river
before it enters the sea. This is very important given the high levels of
pollution already found in the Black Sea.'
One of the first acts of Romania's post-communist government in 1990 was to
halt all building and land reclamation projects in the delta, to designate
the region a protected biosphere area and to set up the Danube Delta
Biosphere Reserve Authority to administer it.
The World Bank grant, made from its Global Environment Facility, will be
used to reverse some of the damage done in the past 50 years and to
strengthen the authority, which is based in the port of Tulcea where the
delta begins.
One aim of the five-year project is to restore reed banks and land reclaimed
by the communists for agricultural use to their natural state. Reeds, which
cover about one-third of the delta, are particularly important - it is in
compact reed banks that water from the Danube is trapped and filtered, says
Grigore Baboianu, the authority's executive director.
The country's former rulers saw the reeds as a cheap source of cellulose for
paper manufacturing. In the 1950s, plans were drawn up to harvest half a
million tonnes a year from the delta. Although this target was never
reached, Baboianu says large areas of reeds were destroyed or damaged by
heavy harvesting equipment.
Another important aim of the project is to prevent further damage to the
delta.
Around one-third of the World Bank grant will be used to strengthen the
authority's supervisory and administrative functions.
A law passed last December gave it wide-ranging powers, including
responsibility for licensing fishing and other commercial activities and the
right to fine those who fail to respect environmental protection rules.
Shipping and other companies, for example, can be fined for discharging
dirty water into the delta and individuals for fishing without a permit.
In practice, however, the authority has had insufficient funds to carry out
its tasks adequately. 'At the moment, we have just 90 wardens - one for
every 4,000-5,000ha - and no way of contacting them in the field,' says
Baboianu. The grant will be used to increase the number of wardens to 250,
to train them and to buy equipment such as boats, binoculars and radios.
Wardens monitor the environment and wildlife in their districts and check
that regulations are adhered to. The emphasis is on working with local
communities, which are among the poorest and most isolated in Romania and
whose people live from the land and from fishing and hunting. Most can only
be reached by boat.
Baboianu says: 'We do have problems with poachers and with people
misunderstanding our role, but we do not want to be seen as a force against
the people. We hope we can convince them to look on us as some kind of
ecological vet, helping preserve and improve the area for everyone.'
A greater problem is protecting the delta from pollutants in the Danube,
especially fertilisers, phosphates and nutrients used in intensive farming.
Their excessive use has led to eutrophication, manifested by an explosion of
algae.
'This phenomenon is very dangerous for us. Algae cover the surface of the
water and block light and oxygen for the more complex water plants and
animals below, eventually killing them,' says Baboianu.
This problem cannot be solved without co-operation from other Danube and
Black Sea countries, many of which, like Romania, are undergoing difficult
transitions to a market economy and can ill afford environmental clean-up
projects. 'We've made a start,' says Baboianu, 'but we can't look at the
delta in isolation. We also need to solve the problems upstream and
downstream.'

FT  17 AUG 94 / People: WEW loses another top man
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ian Grabiner has resigned as managing director of WEW, which runs 61 What
Everyone Wants discount stores, in what the company says is an 'amicable
arrangement'.
His departure will nevertheless come as a blow to the Glasgow-based group
which is trying to restore stability after a series of departures  - the
company has had three chairmen in less than two years - and is engaged in a
rapid expansion programme following December's refinancing.
Peter Carr, executive chairman since last year, says Grabiner's contribution
in his five years at WEW, previously known as Amber Day, had been
'considerable', but Grabiner had now decided to look at new opportunities.
Carr says reports suggesting differences of opinion between Grabiner and the
company's new management were unfounded. 'We are going through a period of
great change here, moving into a new gear. Ian felt he had made his
contribution and wanted to move on to other things.'
What Everyone Wants, previously owned by Gerald and Vera Weisfeld, was
acquired by Amber Day in 1990, but has been dogged by problems since then
with the departure of chairman Philip Green in September 1992, and of his
successor Stacey Ellis seven months later. Chief executive David Thompson
resigned last year.
The group now plans to double the number of stores to 125 over five years,
and will be opening 12 in the next three months. Peter Carr says recent
trading has been encouraging, with like-for-like sales increases  - which
exclude new stores - of 5 to 6 per cent in recent months.
Carr is taking over the managing director's responsibilities for the
foreseeable future, but says a new MD may be appointed eventually.

FT  17 AUG 94 / People: BBC post speculation on the increase
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Speculation about who will succeed Marmaduke Hussey as chairman of the BBC
is likely to increase following the re-appointment of Sir George Russell
(above) as chairman of the Independent Television Commission for two more
years.
The ITC is responsible for licensing and regulating the UK's commercial TV
stations. Sir George, 58, who is also chairman of 3i, has been chairman of
the ITC since it was established in 1990 and is generally regarded as having
done a good job in helping the commercial TV industry cope with the new
broadcasting act.
His name has been mentioned as a possible successor to Hussey who has been
chairman of the BBC since 1986.
It is not unknown for the chairman of the BBC to be brought in from the
commercial sector. Lord Hill, the BBC's radio doctor before becoming
chairman of the Independent Television Authority, was appointed chairman of
the BBC in the late 1960s by Harold Wilson, a Labour prime minister who was
concerned at the BBC's alleged anti-Labour bias. Later Lady Plowden, a
vice-chairman of the BBC in the early 1970s, was switched to be chairman of
the Independent Broadcasting Authority.
Although Marmaduke Hussey has been reappointed for a second five-year term
which expires in April 1996, there has been speculation that he might retire
early, especially now that the questions over the renewal of the BBC's
charter have been removed. Hussey turns 71 later this month.
However, the extension of Sir George's term as ITC chairman for two years
from January 1 means that his term will run past the date when the BBC job
falls vacant.

Northern Rock will become the UK's 10th largest building society when its
merger with North of England building society goes through later this year,
but its board seems to be expanding even faster than its assets. As well as
Ridley, who is a new appointment, it is acquiring three non-executive
directors from North of England, taking the board total to 16 from its
current 13.
Ridley (left), 36, is a journalist who spent nine years at The Economist and
was one of the nine candidates tipped last year for the editorship, which
went to Bill Emmott. Appropriately for someone who will be expected to give
an outside perspective on how the society is performing, he writes a column
for the Sunday Telegraph called 'Down to earth'. (See Observer)

FT  17 AUG 94 / Recruitment: Hidden motives behind ageism - Employment
obstacles for older managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Those Metroland suburbs described here three weeks ago as the focus of 1990s
unemployment have been responding with some gusto to the problem of age
discrimination, which has created a class of disillusioned, jobless
managerial professionals.
While the responses were, in the main, positive - some even offered jobs -
they were not all wholly sympathetic.
The most compelling points came from those who had experienced unemployment
themselves and who were now back in work. Brian Winch of Knapton, Norfolk,
proves that the problem is not confined to Metroland. Now in his 50s, he was
made redundant three times before becoming managing director of a
manufacturing company.
He confirms that many recruitment consultants do rule out applications from
the over-50s, even the over-45s in some cases, because their clients insist
on this age limitation.
Once managers have got back into employment, Winch says with undisguised
glee, 'those of us who have been so treated by these consultants take good
care not to use them for recruitment.'
His next target is personnel departments which 'try to reflect what they
think the senior management wants, not what the company needs, and usually
are the main source of prejudice against age.' If you can negotiate these
hurdles, he says, 'once you get access to top management, prejudice seems to
disappear'.
Are the personnel officers forgiven when he is back in the driving seat?
Winch replies: 'My remedy is simple in that my first action in a company is
to declare redundant the whole of the personnel department and not replace
them.'
Not all his comments side with the middle-aged executive job seekers. Many
of them, with backgrounds in tiered status organisations, can be a 'damned
nuisance' in a flat structure, constantly writing internal memos and playing
company politics, says Winch. Others tend to oppose change, particularly
when it involves redundancies.
He maintains that this applies to only those middle-aged managers who refuse
to adapt. 'Many of us just get on with it as part of life and the times we
live in, and don't let it get to us,' he says.
Winch, however, has not had, perhaps, an ordeal like that of Nicholas
Athorne, a 43-year-old professional corporate banker with more than 16
years' experience in North America and the City. He lost his job three years
ago and today he has two jobs, one as a truck driver and one as a business
consultant to medium-sized companies.
Athorne, who lives in Suffolk, was dispossessed of his house, drew income
support for a time and had a number of low-paid casual jobs. He has
networked among fellow professionals, printed 'umpteen versions' of his CV
on his personal computer, collected drawers full of rejection letters and
admits to feeling despondent on occasion.
Ageist policies in banks, he believes, will rebound on them when they lose
business because their staff are too inexperienced. 'Perhaps eventually
senior management will come to realise that the marginal additional cost for
experience can more often than not outweigh the excessive cost of loan
provisions,' he writes.
Other readers made similar points, but many were short on solutions. Brian
Winch says his company employs a number of older people, some on temporary
contracts, in jobs out of the mainstream. All have previously held senior
positions, but have adapted to the new challenges and 'recognise that their
old career has gone forever.'
On this theme he suggests that, just as companies have management
development and promotion, so they need 'management undevelopment and
unpromotion (not demotion).'
There might be some merit in this idea were it not for one large obstacle -
final salary pensions. One reader, Alan Smallbone, a retired insurance
executive, argues that the way final-salary schemes are structured means
that underlying funding rates for employers increase with the age of the
employee.
Those who believe that pensions cannot influence ageist policies could look
at the US. Continental Can (then a subsidiary of Kiewit Continental, a
Nebraska construction company) in the US agreed to pay Dollars 415m to 3,000
former employees three years ago after a court case exposed a computerised
plan that triggered redundancies for workers who reached a 'magic number' -
a combination of age and years of service that qualified them for pension
benefits.
In the UK, where employees have no such legal protection, removing older
employees can prove a useful way of creating a pension scheme surplus.
Another problem is that employees who recognise that their salary levels in
the last year or few years of employment is crucial to their pension
entitlement will be reluctant to take a salary drop commensurate with a
change of responsibilities.
Even though it is arguable that age discrimination in employment is just as
damaging as that based on sex, race or disability - all against the law in
the UK - the government is not in favour of legislation.
The table shows a selection of findings from Day Associates' latest
quarterly survey of pay and benefits in City of London banks. Carried out
earlier this month, it covers data on 315 jobs in 131 banks and finance
houses.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Lords favour heavier trucks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Heavier trucks should be allowed on Britain's roads, an all-party committee
of the House of Lords says in a report out today.
The committee recommends that the present maximum truck weight of 38 tonnes
spread over five axles - soon to be raised to 40 tonnes under European Union
legislation - should be increased to 44 tonnes on six axles. It says that
this would reduce wear on roads from individual trucks and result in fewer
journeys.
Raising the maximum weight of trucks would not necessarily lead to an
increase in the size of vehicles, because many lorries are capable of
carrying more payload, the committee says.
The report discusses a proposed EU directive setting maximum weights and
dimensions for trucks of 3.5 tonnes and more. Present EU rules are
fragmented and complicate haulage companies' planning.
The committee acknowledges that heavier trucks will increase competition
with rail, but says this can be countered. It says there should be tough
enforcement to prevent overloading, increased grants to encourage companies
to use rail and a move to charging hauliers the full cost of road use,
including environmental and safety costs.
The committee urges tight specifications for the suspensions of larger
trucks to minimise road damage and says local authorities should be
encouraged to make greater use of their powers to set routes for heavy
vehicles.
The report is in favour of an EU proposal for a small increase in the
maximum width of trucks from 2.5 metres to 2.55 metres to allow the more
efficient loading of pallets. This is still less than the 2.6 metres allowed
at present for refrigerated trucks.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Aid sought to stem tourism decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Spending by visitors to Scotland is declining, tourist industry leaders were
warned yesterday.
Mr Derek Reid, new chief executive of the Scottish Tourist Board, said
Scotland was falling behind other developed countries in the growth of its
tourism industry.
Mr Reid called for extra government funding for marketing and substantial
private-sector investment in tourist facilities and training.
Spending by tourists in Scotland peaked at Pounds 2.5bn in 1987, he said.
Last year's spending of Pounds 2.1bn was 17 per cent below that for 1989 in
real terms.
Growth in overseas tourism in recent years had not been enough to offset the
decline in domestic tourism, both from England and from Scotland.
Mr Reid was speaking at a conference in Stirling Castle held to launch a
Pounds 1.5m television advertising campaign aimed at the English market,
which he described as the Scottish industry's problem child.
The 40-second commercial, first screened last night in England and Northern
Ireland, is intended to give Scotland a more contemporary image for the
English.
The Scottish Tourist Board has unveiled a new logo based on the thistle.
The conference, attended by 200 leaders of organisations and companies
involved in tourism, also heard details of a strategic plan prepared by the
Scottish Tourism Co-Ordinating Group, which consists of public-sector
agencies led by the Scottish Office. The strategy contains measures aimed at
achieving 20 per cent growth in tourist spending by the year 2000 and
increasing the employment in the industry from 170,000 in 1991 to 210,000 by
then.
The organisation of Scotland's tourist industry is being revamped. The
Scottish Tourist Board promotes tourism across the whole country, having
taken over marketing of the Highlands from Highlands and Islands Enterprise.
However, it has handed over the task of assisting tourism businesses to the
network of local enterprise companies controlled by Scottish Enterprise and
Highlands and Islands Enterprise.
The number of area tourist boards is to be reduced to 14 from 34 by 1996.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Threatened councils face publicity probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Audit Commission, the local government spending watchdog, said yesterday
that it was investigating complaints that county and district councils were
wasting public funds on publicity campaigns for the English local government
review.
The cross-party Association of District Councils has said that some county
councils were 'getting away with scaremongering, twisting the truth and
breaking a strict code of conduct' in an attempt to enlist 'public support
for self-preservation'.
With the Local Government Commission's public consultation into future
council structures due to end by the end of the month, divisions between
councils have deepened.
Legal guidelines established by the government in 1988 say that councils
'should not use public funds to mount publicity campaigns whose primary
purpose is to persuade the public to hold a particular view'.
Complaints to district auditors suggest, however, that the guidelines are
being flouted by district councils as well.
Most counties favour leaving the local government system as it is, while a
majority of districts favour abolishing county councils and replacing them
with new single-tier unitary authorities.
Exeter city council was reported to the auditor after banners with the
slogan 'Home Rule for Exeter' were placed in the city's main streets, and on
an electronic notice-board. The council said that it had spent Pounds 500 on
publicity - less than the county's budget - and that it was for others to
decide whether the slogan was meant to persuade.
Districts have objected to county information leaflets which ended with
specific advice on how to reply to the commission, such as 'Vote Option
Three for the Red Rose County of Lancashire'.
The association made charges of excessive expenditure against several county
councils:
Essex county councillors earmarked Pounds 135,000 from emergency funds for
public relations;
Nottinghamshire county councillors were asked to add Pounds 150,000 to the
existing public relations budget;
West Sussex county council is paying 'more than Pounds 44,000' to commission
a special edition of a local newspaper;
Leicestershire spent Pounds 70,000 on printing and distributing booklets.
The Labour-controlled Association of County Councils dismissed the
districts' claims of 'dirty propaganda'.
The commission estimates total expenditure on campaigning by councils
exceeded its own publicity costs of about Pounds 2m for the year to cover 32
counties.

FT  17 AUG 94 / More strike-breaking trains due: Railtrack hopes to run 40%
of network during next week's 24-hour stoppage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Railtrack hopes to run 40 per cent of the railway network during next week's
24-hour strike starting at noon on Monday, an official said yesterday.
As this week's stoppage ended last night, when one-third of trains operated,
Railtrack's east Anglia area said a quarter of the striking signal workers
had returned to work.
Mr Richard Middleton, the area's director, said: 'I do hope that this will
make the RMT realise our signal workers' support for the strike is declining
and that the only way to resolve the dispute is to return to the negotiating
table.'
The RMT said the company's claim of a drift back to work was exaggerated and
insisted that there was still 'massive support' from the signal workers to
continue the action.
The transport union announced yesterday a further 48-hour strike by its
signal workers for immediately after the August bank holiday weekend. It
will last from noon on Tuesday August 30 to noon on Thursday September 1.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said that his executive announced the
new strike dates to 'dispel public doubts' that the union might disrupt
travel during the holiday period itself.
The announcement came as the British Chambers of Commerce issued a warning
that the strike, now in its 10th week, could inflict long-term damage on
British industry.
Mr Richard Brown, the chambers' deputy director general, said businesses had
coped with the stoppages because of good weather, clear roads, school
holidays and lower-than-normal business activity in the summer months.
But he said: 'Once business gets back up to full speed in September, schools
go back and the weather gets worse, road congestion will be severe and firms
will no longer be able to duck and dive around the strikes.
'We will then see more money being lost in terms of lost business and higher
costs in the short term, and long-term damage to those businesses still
struggling to grow.'
Mr David Armstrong, Railtrack's industrial relations director, denounced the
RMT's latest decision as 'irresponsible' and 'callous'.
He said: 'This action will cause massive disruption to passengers and
freight users and it is a savage blow to the whole rail industry. It will
also hit the tourist industry, which does much of its trade in that holiday
week.'

FT  17 AUG 94 / More short breaks and less haggis: Gloomy news about holiday
industry earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As tourism destinations Scotland and Ireland have a lot in common. Both have
picturesque sea lochs and mountains, a distinct history and rainy climates.
But there is an important difference between them.
Scotland's tourist revenues have fallen in real terms in recent years, while
the Republic of Ireland's have risen. Scotland earned Pounds 1bn more than
Ireland in 1987 but the republic has now overtaken it. The number of tourist
visits to the Irish republic has been growing by 6 per cent a year while
those to Scotland have fallen by 1 per cent.
These were among the grim facts spelt out yesterday by Mr Derek Reid, the
new chief executive of the Scottish Tourist Board. Mr Reid, a former
managing director of Cadbury-Schweppes' food side who was instrumental in
the management buy-out of Cadbury-Typhoo to create Premier Brands in 1986,
said Scotland had suffered not just from the UK recession but from the
effects of the Gulf war on its main overseas market, the US.
But he did not spare past policies of the board. It was no good 'trying to
make water run uphill' by trying to persuade English people to spend their
main holiday in Scotland when they wanted to spend it abroad. In future the
board would focus efforts in England on selling short breaks.
The industry had failed to respond to the demand for out-of-season holidays.
'We have talked about short breaks and seasonality in every strategic plan
ever written - yet the graph of seasonality has scarcely altered,' he said.
As a specialist in promoting brands he was evidently appalled that the board
had had four different campaigns in the English market with differing
consumer messages in the last five years. 'This is not the way to create
Scotland the brand,' he chided.
'We can carry on as we are,' Mr Reid said, 'but this will inevitably lead to
a continuation of the slow, gradual decline. Or we can embrace a strategy of
going for growth.'
The new strategy for the Scottish tourist industry involves clearer
marketing. An advertising campaign aims to give the country more emotional
appeal, avoiding references to haggis, tartan and bagpipes.
Greater cohesion of the tourism effort is being sought, following the
reallocation of roles among public bodies involved in tourism. Mr Reid said,
however, that there was still a plethora of Local Enterprise Companies - the
economic development bodies - and area tourist boards (these are being
reduced) and the industry had to ensure that 'the left and right hands are
working together'.
Mr Reid's most obvious anxiety is about the shortage of public money for the
industry. Scotland's official spending on marketing in 1993-94 was only
Pounds 7m, compared with the Republic of Ireland's Pounds 17m and New
Zealand's Pounds 25m in 1992-93. The board's marketing budget is frozen
under public spending limits.
The Irish republic, Mr Reid pointed out, was also far outspending Scotland
in capital investment - Pounds 37m out of public funds in 1991 compared with
Scotland's Pounds 15m.
With the government resources currently available, a growth rate of 1 per
cent a year was the maximum Scotland could achieve, with a 3 per cent rise
in spending from overseas visitors and static spending by English and
Scottish tourists.
But if the government were to allocate another Pounds 5m to the Scottish
Tourist Board for spending on UK marketing and another Pounds 2m for
overseas marketing, plus a substantial boost to training and capital
spending, annual growth of 3 per cent was achievable, he said, although that
would still be less than the Irish republic and below the OECD average.
Mr Reid sugared his discreet plea for more government money by saying that
the private sector might be able to contribute Pounds 1m for every Pounds 5m
of state funding for marketing.

FT  17 AUG 94 / TUC queries falls in jobless total
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Recent falls in the unemployment total have more to do with men between 35
and 60 giving up the search for work than with real reductions in
unemployment, says a report published by the TUC yesterday, in advance of
today's unemployment figures.
The TUC says its analysis of the government's Labour Force Survey showed
that 110,000 men between 35 and 60 withdrew from the labour market in 1993,
dropping out of the government's unemployment statistics.
A 30 per cent reduction in places on the government's special employment and
training programmes since 1990 has also cut opportunities for the long-term
unemployed to retrain and make themselves more employable.
Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, accused the government of creating 'a
lost generation of middle-aged men who have given up hope of work. There is
little prospect of many of them getting back into the labour market unless
the government steps up special measures to help the long-term unemployed
and acts to reinforce Britain's patchy recovery.'

FT  17 AUG 94 / 'Shadow toll' road plan to be announced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Details of the first road schemes to be financed and built by the private
sector in return for the payment of 'shadow tolls' by the government are
expected to be announced today.
Under this initiative motorists will not pay tolls - the companies which
build and manage the roads will be paid by the government according to the
number of vehicles which use them.
Companies will design new sections of road, ensure that they are maintained
to a set standard and even arrange to clear snow.
The government's aim is to move to a system of real tolls, with motorists
paying directly for the use of motorways. It is testing electronic tolling
systems with the aim of introducing motorway charging after 1998.
The British Road Federation said a 10-mile link-road between the M1 and the
A1 near Leeds was expected to be among the first road contracts let on the
basis of 'design, build, finance and operate'. The road is expected to cost
Pounds 117m and would remove 8,000 heavy trucks a day from Leeds city
centre.
Other likely schemes identified by the federation include the M1/M62
interchange at Lofthouse near Leeds, costing Pounds 31m, and the upgrading
of sections of the A1(M) between Hook Moor and Bramham, North Yorkshire,
costing Pounds 79m, and between Alconbury and Peterborough, Cambridgeshire,
costing Pounds 83m.
The federation said: 'Shadow tolling can give us some road improvements
years earlier than if we waited for the Treasury to fund them
conventionally. But we are not getting something for nothing and these
improvements will still have to be paid for with public money.'
According to Wilde Sapte, a law firm which has studied the shadow tolling
initiative, it will be difficult in the early stages to quantify the risks
to companies of taking on the construction and management of road schemes. A
move to real electronic tolls could lead to motorists diverting from
motorways, for example.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Brussels denies claim on disabled workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A fresh row over the UK's priority supplier scheme to help disabled workers
blew up between London and Brussels yesterday after the European Commission
denied British claims that it had questioned the legality of the scheme last
week.
British officials said on Monday that Mr Martin Bangemann, EU industry
commissioner, had written to Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, to inform
the UK government that the Commission was investigating the legality of the
scheme.
The disclosure was intended to undermine claims by the Commission that it
was unaware of legal problems caused by an EU directive on public
procurement which took effect in June.
Mr Michael Portillo, employment secretary, withdrew government departments
from the scheme last week, after receiving legal advice that it was
incompatible with the directive.
Commission officials conceded that Mr Bangemann had written to Mr Hurd, but
denied that the letter was connected to the furore over the priority scheme,
which allows companies employing mainly disabled workers a chance to make a
second bid for government contracts to match the winning tender.
The letter 'has nothing to do with this case,' the Commission said.
However, the Foreign Office said Mr Bangemann had specifically confirmed the
Commission's doubts about the legality of the scheme.
The letter, signed by Mr Bangemann on Friday, is mainly concerned with the
Commission's dismissal of a complaint under EU competition legislation
against a company which lost a government contract to Remploy, one of the
biggest employers of disabled workers.
But it continues: 'The Commission would draw your attention to the fact that
this decision does not prejudice its position regarding the priority
supplier status granted to Remploy by the UK authorities, which it is
currently examining to establish whether it is compatible with the rules
relating to public procurement.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of companies registered for value added tax last year fell 1.7
per cent from 1992 levels, official figures showed yesterday.
The number of company deregistrations rose from 206,000 in 1992 to 218,000
last year, the Department of Trade and Industry statistics showed.
There were 190,000 new registrations of companies last year, almost
unchanged from the previous year. This brought the number of companies
registered to 1.6m at the end of last year.
The latest figures include an adjustment for an increase in the VAT
threshold in November 1993 from Pounds 37,600. The change is estimated to
have reduced registrations by 2,000 and increased deregistrations by 3,000.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Court action on music monopoly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A music company will today seek in the High Court to enforce a monopoly of
distribution of records outside the US by singers such as Johnny Cash and
groups including the Black Crowes and Slayer.
Phonogram, the UK unit of PolyGram, the music and film group in which
Philips of the Netherlands has a majority stake, will seek to block American
Recordings, the US recording label formerly known as Def American, from
dealing with any other distributor for its artists outside the US.
Phonogram is claiming that American Recordings has violated a joint venture
agreement in which Phonogram was named as sole distributor for American's
artists outside the US.
The action before the High Court is a counter-suit to a Dollars 14m (Pounds
9m) action by American in the Los Angeles Superior Court.
The US record label has said that Phonogram did not abide by the terms of
the agreement and that the company did not promote its artists as agreed,
file tax returns, pay royalties, or set up office space.
American says that Phonogram improperly withdrew Dollars 4.5m from the joint
venture between the two companies. It accuses Phonogram of failing to pay
advances, keep separate accounts, and open separate books for the joint
venture.
Last month Phonogram tried to introduce into evidence a tape recording of a
conversation between American Recordings executives and their lawyer to
demonstrate American's motives for bringing the suit in the US.
It is alleged that Phonogram obtained the tape from an unidentified
'hacker', and a High Court judge refused to allow the tape into proceedings
on the grounds that it interfered with privileged communications between
clients and their lawyers.
Phonogram and PolyGram have refused to comment while the cases are in
progress.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Lib Dems diverge over tax proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrats yesterday suggested giving people a greater choice
over parts of the taxation system by asking them which projects they would
like to be paid for by taxes.
The radical proposals, contained in a preliminary report by one of the
party's working groups, appeared, however, to run ahead of what the Lib Dems
are prepared to advocate as national policy.
Mr Malcolm Bruce, the party's Treasury spokesman, while calling for the tax
system to be more transparent, distanced himself from some of the bolder
suggestions contained in the report, Being Honest About Taxation.
The report group says ear-marking, or 'hypothecation', of some tax for
specific projects would help clarify the link between tax and spending.
The report suggests converting National Insurance Contributions into a
'pensions payment' to clarify its purpose and that every household should
receive an annual government statement of tax and spending plans. It also
says that health, which accounts for more than Pounds 30bn of government
spending, could be covered by allocating to it excise duties on alcohol and
tobacco and a smaller slice of income tax.
Mr Andrew Dilnot, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the
proposals were 'confusing and dishonest', and questioned why health spending
should be dictated by alcohol and tobacco consumption.
Mr Bruce said he did not believe that the ear-marking of taxes could work
across the board, but it could make a significant difference on the
'margin'. He accepted that if the hypothecation was too big people would
forget what they had been asked to pay for.
He said, however, that people would not mind paying more tax if they knew
what it was going towards.
Mr Alistair Darling, Labour Treasury spokesman, criticised the proposals as
'a soggy confusion of concepts'.
Sir George Young, financial secretary to the Treasury, said: 'It simply
tells us what we already know, that the Liberal Democrats want to increase
public expenditure and will have to raise taxes.'

FT  17 AUG 94 / Ofsted criticises maths and science teaching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mathematics and science teaching in the schools of England and Wales are
'not as strong as they should be', says a report published yesterday by
Ofsted, the education watchdog.
The popularity of science subjects among A-level pupils has declined and
'there is no room for complacency over the supply of well-qualified young
adults for employment in engineering or science-related fields', it says.
The proportion of those studying for science and mathematics A-levels only
has fallen from 27.6 per cent in the early 1980s to 16.7 per cent this year.
According to the Joint Mathematical Council this means that the proportion
of the age group potentially qualified to study a science subject or
engineering at university has fallen 40 per cent over the decade.
Two-thirds of those studying science A-levels are doing so in combination
with non-science subjects. The report says they are increasingly likely to
choose accountancy, law or business studies courses in higher education,
rather than science or engineering.
A fall in the number of school-leavers is partly to blame, it adds.
The proportion of all 18-year-olds taking science A-levels rose slightly
over the last decade, with the proportion taking maths A-level rising from
6.5 per cent in 1983 to 7.7 per cent in 1993.
But over the same period, the proportion attempting A-levels in English rose
from 5.9 to 14.4 per cent. Ofsted said teaching of mathematics for children
aged seven to 11, and of science for those from 11 to 14, needed to be
improved.
The narrowness of the three-subject A-level curriculum in the sixth form
meant that most primary teachers did not have mathematics qualifications
beyond GCSE, the level normally attained by the age of 16.
As a result there was a problem with teachers' confidence in mathematics.
Many had 'little theoretical understanding' about how progress in learning
numbers occurs. In-service teacher-training should be expanded to meet this
problem, the inspectors say.
Mr Mike Tomlinson, Ofsted's director of inspection, said an expansion in
spending on better teaching facilities, which last saw heavy investment in
1988 during the introduction of GCSE exams, might persuade more scientists
to become teachers. He suggested this could be as much as Pounds 100m.
Vandalism, theft and malicious fire cost schools in England and Wales Pounds
49m in the 1992-93 financial year, the Department for Education said
yesterday.
This represented a fall of 32 per cent from the costs created by crime the
previous year, but insurance costs were estimated to have increased by 38
per cent to more than Pounds 66m - or about Pounds 3,000 per school.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Pensions ombudsman warns of risk to payouts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's proposal for a pension compensation scheme for victims of
fraud and theft will still leave large numbers of pension scheme members
without a safety net, the pensions ombudsman said yesterday.
The ombudsman, Mr Michael Platt, was delivering the annual report of the
office. Although he welcomed the proposed compensation plan, intended to
cover members in the event of fraud, theft or misappropriation of assets,
'there could continue to be instances of malpractice or gross
maladministration outside these categories. So the members of these schemes
may still be at risk of losing some or all of their entitlement'.
He stopped short of endorsing a wider compensation scheme, saying that the
government should not allow companies to neglect their obligations and
expect the scheme to foot the bill.
Mr Platt said in the report he had ordered more than Pounds 900,000 of
restitution to be paid to pension scheme members.
The number of complaints brought to the ombudsman in the year ended March 31
was broadly unchanged from the previous two years at 2,179.
The largest single payment was Pounds 190,000 paid to a former executive
whose employer had claimed he owed the company money. The employer was sole
trustee of the pension scheme and, in what the ombudsman determined was an
example of conflict of interest by a trustee, deducted the disputed amount
from the executive's pension.
The trustee should have paid the sum to the scheme member, Mr Platt said.
'In refusing to do so until the other matters were resolved, it had placed
its corporate interests first.'
The report singles out conflict of interest by professional advisers,
particularly among small schemes, as a prime area of concern. 'Small
companies do rely on advisers; I have on occasion been disappointed to see
that the adviser did not take an ethically strong stance,' said Mr Platt.
Members have also complained about the winding up of schemes. This often
happens when an employer becomes insolvent. The ombudsman notes that in the
past 18 months there has been an increasing number of complaints from
members of schemes which are winding up and which had been marketed by Crown
Financial Management. In early 1993 the business was transferred to Century
Life.
Eighty-five per cent of the business transferred to Century is being wound
up and it will be years before all members in plans formerly administered by
Crown will be able to ascertain all their benefits.

<TEXT>
Details of cases in the pensions ombudsman's report illustrate what critics
of pension law have for years been describing as loopholes.
Three scheme members complained that their employer was not contributing the
amount to the pension scheme recommended by the actuary.
On investigation this proved correct and it subsequently emerged that some
contributions had been retained by the parent company of the sponsoring
employer.
The managing director of the sponsoring employer, his wife and a pensions
professional were scheme trustees. The employer went into liquidation in
April 1993 but the parent company continued to trade.
The managing director of the employer said that the company had been paying
the most it could afford and at least kept the employees on the payroll
before making them redundant in 1991.
The professional trustee, in explaining the difficulties the scheme had,
told the ombudsman that the managing director's wife had played no part in
the affair as she was 'only a housewife'.
In any event, he said he was not informed of the employer's reduced
contributions.
Although the ombudsman was powerless to force the employer to contribute at
the rate necessary to pay all benefits - the law does not require that - he
did order the parent company to turn over contributions it had withheld.
Mr Q made a number of complaints. He said he could not obtain information
about his benefits, that he had suspicions that his employer had financial
difficulties and that the pension scheme might be affected. The employer was
the corporate trustee of the scheme.
It later transpired that a big payment to the trustee - on behalf of the
scheme members - had actually been accepted by the bank as a credit in the
employer's account prior to the company going into receivership.
The scheme was left with a large deficit although the missing payment would
have covered all benefits due.
The ombudsman could not accept the complaint for investigation because,
among other reasons, ordering restitution for Mr Q would disadvantage other
scheme members.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Universities expect 'bunfight' after reform of admissions:
With A-level results out tomorrow, John Authers finds colleges confused
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Publication of A-level results in England and Wales tomorrow signals the
start of a new university admissions system.
The separate admissions systems of Ucca for universities and Pcas for
polytechnics have been merged, two years after the distinction between the
two sectors was abolished, to form the Universities and Colleges Admissions
Service.
The reform makes sense but it has already had unforeseen consequences -
creating extra work for university admissions departments. Vice-chancellors
fear admissions could develop into a 'bunfight', while clearance system
officials refer to a 'guessing game' by universities.
Middle-ranking universities fear they will have many more places left
unfilled at this stage than usual, and that there will be an increased
drop-out rate among the students they eventually take, many of whom will
find themselves in a university they had not previously considered.
Each sixth-former has applied for more courses this year, with an average of
seven courses being named on each Ucas form - the maximum allowed is eight.
Last year students were limited to five choices by Ucca, and to four by
Pcas. It was possible to apply through both systems simultaneously,
producing a maximum of nine possible applications, although barely half of
all applicants bothered to do this.
The number of applications to universities via Ucas this year was almost 15
per cent higher than the number applying through the two systems last year.
But the number of potential students applying is much the same, meaning more
offers by universities will be rejected.
Admissions tutors cannot forecast how big the effect will be even though the
overall standards required of successful candidates this year are likely to
be much the same as last year.
Government funding restrictions, which aim to see student numbers
consolidated at their current levels for the next three years, are a further
complication.
The funding councils which control university finances will 'cap' their
funding this year so that institutions will receive no money at all for
students they admit in excess of target numbers.
This funding policy was only announced in March, even though universities
had been processing applications since September last year.
According to the Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals several
universities have tried to ensure that they are not capped by being stricter
than usual in the A-level grades they require.
If the universities have miscalculated it could mean they have more places
than usual to offer through the clearing system, used by students who have
not accepted and fulfilled conditional A-level offers.
Mr Tony Higgins, joint chief executive of Ucas, said: 'Because there is no
historical precedent to work on, admissions tutors do not know how many
offers to make. In the past they were able to get some idea of the ratio of
offers they had to make to the number of places available, bearing in mind
how many were likely or unlikely to meet the offer requirements. Now it is
getting close to guesswork.'
His best guess, however, is that the system, which allows students to keep
only two offers at this stage in the process, will cause a standstill in
applications to middle-ranking universities.
This is because most applicants keep one harder offer from their favoured
university while maintaining a much easier 'insurance' offer from a former
polytechnic or college of higher education.
Hence middle-ranking universities - which benefited from 'insurance' offers
under Ucca - could find themselves with places to fill.
Welfare officers believe students who come through clearing, and are
therefore not attending the university of their choice, are more likely to
drop out.
According to the vice-chancellors' committee: 'Colleges believe there will
be more potential drop-outs this year and are training up more counsellors
to try and help.'

FT  17 AUG 94 / School-leaver recruitment increases
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Recruitment of school-leavers by large UK companies has more than doubled
this year, says a new survey of graduate and professional salaries.
The report, by Hay Management Consultants, also provides further evidence of
a recovery in graduate recruitment, although this is much slower.
It says companies increased their median average number of recruits with
only A-level qualifications or equivalent from four last year to nine this
year.
For university graduates the rise was from nine to 10, accompanied by a rise
in starting salary of slightly more than 3 per cent.
Science, computer studies and engineering were the most favoured degree
courses, with arts and social sciences the least attractive to employers.
The survey covered 127 organisations.

FT  17 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Leaders of Brazil and Bolivia fail to
clinch gas pipeline deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Presidents Itamar Franco of Brazil and Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada of Bolivia
yesterday failed to agree details of a Dollars 1.8bn gas pipeline, to be
built from Bolivia's extensive fields of natural gas to Brazil's industrial
south, reports Angus Foster in Sao Paulo.
The pipeline is expected to go ahead eventually but agreement on the
shareholdings in the project has been delayed by negotiations over the price
Brazil should pay for Bolivian gas and over the quantities it should take.
The project, which has been under discussion for 18 months, was advanced at
the weekend when Petrobras, the Brazilian state-owned oil and gas company,
announced it had chosen the BTB consortium as the main partner for its share
of the project. BTB is a joint venture of BHP, Tenneco and British Gas.
The Brazilian constitution obliges Petrobras to retain control of oil and
gas ventures in the country, so the company is guaranteed a 51 per cent
shareholding in the Brazilian part of the project. Petrobras wants to divide
the remaining 49 per cent among BTB, a consortium of Brazilian private
companies, and Bolivia's state oil company YPFB.
However, Bolivia maintains that Petrobras made its weekend announcment to
frustrate YPFB's wish to own all the remaining shares. Petrobras says YPFB
was to hold only 4 per cent of the shares, a claim Bolivia strongly denies.
President Sanchez de Lozada said last night that Bolivia wanted 49 per cent
and that the project was a 'parity relationship'. Petrobras and BTB say a
significant third-country shareholding will help raise finance for the
project.
Bolivia is also thought to want to renegotiate the price accord, signed in
February last year. The Andean country now wants either a higher price for
the gas or more consumption by Brazil. The original contract is to expire
today, but is expected to be extended.

FT  17 AUG 94 / World Trade News: India fumes at US 'flammable' skirt ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Indian government yesterday said it would seek a lifting of the US ban
on the import of Indian rayon-cotton textile skirts, imposed because they
were 'dangerously flammable'.
Indian exporters have reacted with dismay to last week's decision by the US
Consumer Product Safety Commission to recall more than 250,000 skirts, in
the biggest ever recall of clothing.
India exported more than Rs1bn (Dollars 31.8m) worth of the skirts to the US
last year, and no accidents have yet been reported.
The Indian government yesterday told parliament it would convene a meeting
of exporters this week in an effort to get the ban lifted. The meeting is
not expected to consider ways of making the skirts less flammable.
The commission claimed the skirts, which sell for between Dollars 6 and
Dollars 80, 'burnt faster than newspaper'.
However, Indian exporters describe the ban as 'inexplicable'. 'We cannot
fathom why they have clamped down on only Indian rayon skirts when China,
Korea and Hong Kong also supply the same fabrics,' says Ms Manju Dhingra,
director of Orient Craft, a Delhi-based garment export house, which sells to
leading fashion stores across the US, including Gap. Asked whether the
skirts could be treated to become less flammable, she said: 'The basic
element of the fabric cannot be changed.'
US Customs last month held up a consignment of the skirts, objecting to
their inclusion under the 'folklore' provision of a bilateral agreement with
India, which allows for non-quota imports. US officials said the skirts did
not conform to the traditional Indian 'ghagra' skirts, because most of them
had elastic waistbands. However, they later accepted Indian arguments that
the waistbands were a 'modern convenience' and the skirts were released
without the imposition of quotas.
Indian commerce ministry officials say the timing of the ban, so soon after
the US Custom's objection, makes it difficult to believe that consumer
safety is the only reason for the ban. 'This seems like an attempt to impose
non-tariff barriers, with the US specially targeting India,' said an
official.
Textile importers and retailers in the US have also expressed dismay at the
ban and are sceptical about whether skirts from other countries have also
been tested.

FT  17 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Unions accuse Sony under Nafta accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US and Mexican labour organisations yesterday filed a complaint against Sony
Corporation, the electronics multi-national, for alleged violations of
worker rights at the company's plants in Mexico.
The complaint was filed under a side agreement to the North American Free
Trade Agreement which provides for the monitoring of labour law enforcement.
It is the first to relate to labour rights violations alleged to have
occurred since the signing of the accord.
The case is being seen as a test of the Clinton administration's commitment
to the agreement's legal provisions for ensuring equivalent rights for
workers in all three countries of Nafta.
The International Labor Rights Education and Research Fund (ILRERF), a
non-profit human rights and labour organisation, in association with two
pro-democracy lobbies in Mexico, is accusing Sony of obstructing free
association of its workers.
They allege that Sony maintained surveillance on active unionists, fired a
number of workers who went on strike and pressured employees to work on
national holidays. The complaint also alleges that Sony has violated the
Mexican Federal Labor Law and criticises the Mexican government for failing
to enforce applicable labour laws which guarantee freedom of association and
limit hours of work.
ILRERF is calling on the US National Administrative Office to hold public
hearings and an on-site investigation of Sony's operations.
Under the complementary arrangements of Nafta regarding labour conditions,
the US cannot impose sanctions to guarantee labour law enforcement, but can
review cases and inform their free trade partners when they perceive
infringements of worker rights.
Sony, which employs 2,000 people at its Nuevo Laredo plants denies any
wrongdoing. Observers say Sony may be caught in a domestic political
conflict between the Confederation of Mexican Workers, the government-linked
union, and workers who wish to establish an organisation independent of the
ruling party.
The Mexican government has not informed Sony of any violation of labour
laws, Sony said. A government spokesman declined comment before the
complaint was filed.

FT  17 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Putting the spark under reforms - A look
at attempts by the Indian government to attract foreign investment into
building a power sector necessary for the country's economic modernisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL and SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Free electricity is one of life's few blessings for slum dwellers in
Shahdara, east Delhi. It is easily obtained by scrambling up an electricity
pole and attaching a wire to the overhead mains. Occasionally, someone gets
electrocuted in the process, but not often.
Electricity board officials turn a blind eye to such pilfering, which
happens all over India. The effort of collecting payment from slums is not
worth the revenues.
Also, decades of socialist thinking have encouraged many Indians to regard
the mostly state-owned electricity distribution boards as welfare agencies.
Farmers in Karnataka state, south India, pay just 5 per cent of cost for
their current. In neighbouring Tamil Nadu they pay nothing.
The result is chronic losses for the industry and frequent power cuts for
consumers thanks to electricity shortages.
However, the government of Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the reform-minded prime
minister, is now committed to overhauling the industry, recognising that
without improved electricity supplies, the economic modernisation programme
launched in 1991 will grind to a halt.
After years of relying on state-owned industry, Mr Rao is calling on private
companies - including foreign groups - to build and operate 100 per cent
privately-owned power plants.
But business has so far been slow to respond. Mr P V Rangayya Naidu,
minister of state for power, yesterday told parliament that 75 investors,
including 35 from overseas had submitted proposals to the government to
invest Rs1,041.52bn (Dollars 33.6bn) to build and operate power stations
with a total capacity of more than 20,000MW. But only four small-scale
plants with a combined capacity of 1,300MW are under construction, all by
Indian-owned companies; four large projects totalling 8,000MW and involving
foreign capital, have been approved by the government, but none is yet under
way.
Businessmen have responded cautiously to the proposals, partly because of
the huge scale of the investments and partly because of doubts about the
government's ability to overhaul the industry's anti-commercial practices.
Even though ministers in Delhi are committed to reform, many local
politicians, who use cheap electricity to buy farmers' votes, are not.
Mr S V Joshi, director of power distribution at the Indian affiliate of
Siemens, the German engineering group, says: 'It took the US 10 years to
switch from public to private sector power generation. India can't do it in
two or three.'
The government's 1992-97 economic plan calls for the addition of 31,000MW of
public sector generating capacity to the existing total of 78,000MW (which
includes 9,000MW from private plants). The public sector does not have the
funds to fulfil the plan.
With a large power station costing Dollars 1bn or more, the only viable way
for private companies to fund such projects is to split the cost between
different equity partners and lenders, including multilateral institutions
such as the World Bank.
Enron, the US energy group, is planning a Dollars 2bn plant for Maharashtra
state to supply Bombay - perhaps the furthest advanced of the schemes
involving foreign capital. Enron is considering asking lenders for about 80
per cent of the funds, with the remaining 20 per cent equity split between
three partners - Enron, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board and General
Electric, the US engineering group which would supply much of the equipment.
Mr Tom White, chairman of Enron Power, Enron's power generation subsidiary,
says raising the money is 'quite a challenge'.
The World Bank, the multilateral lending agency which has funded much of
India's existing power capacity, has said it will support schemes involving
private companies. Officials believe public sector boards are generally poor
managers - Indian power plants run at an average of 60 per cent of full
capacity and 23 per cent of output is lost during transmission.
The Indian government has proposed contracts which would allow generating
companies to pass on increases in fuel costs (the main variable cost) and
earn a minimum net annual profit of 16 per cent.
But most foreign companies say this is not enough. They are asking for
central government guarantees that they will be paid by the state-level
electricity boards, which are the main distributors.
The companies are worried because the electricity boards are controlled by
local state governments, which use electricity supply as a political tool.
The boards make huge losses because they are unable to charge market rates
since politicians manipulate rate increases to protect their constituents,
especially farmers.
The central government had ruled out guarantees, saying the answer lay in
water-tight legally enforceable contracts, but last month, a visiting US
delegation headed by Ms Hazel O'Leary, US secretary of energy, convinced the
government that few foreign investors would be willing to enter the Indian
power sector without counter-guarantees. The government agreed to reconsider
its earlier decision, and announced on Friday that the Enron project would
be the first to receive a guarantee agreement, valid for the 12 years that
the company is servicing its loan obligations. Enron had sought a 25-year
guarantee period.
The government's decision has, nonetheless, paved the way for guarantee
facilities for six other power projects with foreign investment, in Andhra
Pradesh, Orissa, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.
The cabinet also approved guidelines to enable more of the state electricity
boards to qualify for government guarantees. The boards and the states in
which the power plants are being built will need to prove that they are
financially healthy, and the project's financial plans will be closely
monitored by the government's Power Finance Corporation.
The ministry is considering further incentives to tempt foreign companies.
Officials also point to the success of the four Indian private companies in
the industry - the Bombay Suburban Electric Supply Company, the Calcutta
Electric Supply Company, Ahmedabad Electricity and Tata Electric Companies.
All are profitable and most are expanding capacity. As Mr Joshi of Siemens
says: 'This proves India can do it.'

<TEXT>
The pace of new housing construction in the US picked up last month, the
Commerce Department reported yesterday , writes George Graham.
Housing starts rose by 5 per cent in July to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 1.115m, the department said, after falling by 9 per cent the
previous month.
Market economists said that the figure was somewhat stronger than had been
generally expected by most analysts, but still gave indications that higher
mortgage rates were taking a toll on the strength of the housing
construction market.
Although the July pace of housing starts was 14 per cent higher than a year
earlier, it still showed a drop of 12 per cent from the peak seasonally
adjusted rate of more than 1.6m starts reached last December.
Construction of new single family homes remained relatively weak, and much
of the strength in July came from multi-family buildings.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Iranians recall envoy in Argentina
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Iran is recalling its ambassador to Argentina, further raising tensions
between the two countries after an Argentine judge last week accused Iranian
diplomats of having played key roles in bomb attacks against a Jewish
community centre in Buenos Aires last month and against the Israeli embassy
there in 1992.
However, Mr Fernando Petrella, Argentine deputy foreign minister, yesterday
tried to defuse the crisis: 'There are no such things as drastic measures in
diplomacy. We are not recalling our ambassador.'
Mr Mario del Castillo, Argentine ambassador in Tehran, 'was called back to
Buenos Aires for consultations after the bombing. He is in Tehran now but
will be returning to Buenos Aires in a few days.' Staffing at Argentina's
embassy would be halved to two diplomats, Mr Petrella said.
Judge Juan Jose Galeano last week issued international arrest warrants for
four former diplomats at the Iranian embassy in Buenos Aires, saying they
had provided support for the 1992 bombing, which killed 30 people.
He also said three diplomats based in Buenos Aires had helped prepare the
attack last month, which claimed 96 lives. Intelligence officials blame the
Lebanon-based Hizbollah organisation for both bombings.
Iran said it would begin legal action against Argentine officials for
implicating the four diplomats. State-run Tehran Radio said Iran was
'determined to appeal to international judicial organisations to follow up
the accusations brought against the Iranian citizens.'
Israeli and western diplomats in Buenos Aires say that, although Judge
Galeano's evidence against the seven diplomats is weak, they are convinced
that Tehran had indirectly backed both bombings through its sponsorship of
Hizbollah.
The judge's main informant was an Iranian now seeking political asylum in
Ecuador. Diplomats suspect he is inflating his knowledge of the affair to
improve his chances of winning asylum.
Argentine President Carlos Menem appealed for calm at the weekend, after
admitting that officials had over-reacted to intelligence reports from
Israeli and US sources warning of the risks of a third bomb attack. On
Friday, the government issued public statements, warning that an attack was
imminent.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Fed 'stays with the curve' on inflation: But critics fear
the interest rate increases might hamper economic growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US Federal Reserve's decision yesterday to raise short term interest
rates was almost universally expected, but the argument over whether this is
the right step to take is not so one-sided.
In its statement announcing an increase of half a percentage point in both
the discount and federal funds rates, the Fed said it was acting 'against
the background of evidence of continuing strength in the economic expansion
and high levels of resource utilisation'.
'The actions are intended to keep inflationary pressures contained and
thereby foster sustainable economic growth,' the Fed said.
But administration officials and Democratic members of Congress are worried
that the Fed might be too jittery about prices rises that are still scarcely
visible to the naked eye: in its zeal to kill off inflation 18 months down
the road, does it not risk killing off an already slowing economic recovery
before its time?
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, and Ms Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the
chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, were conciliatory
yesterday in their joint statement.
'The administration recognises and respects the independence of the Federal
Reserve to make decisions about the nation's monetary policies. We share a
common goal with the Federal Reserve of sustained growth with low
inflation,' they said.
There is not much more the administration can do, except back the Fed's
board with new appointees. That seems to be having little effect, for
yesterday's vote was unanimous, despite the addition to the board of Mr Alan
Blinder and Ms Janet Yellen, two Clinton nominees.
Democratic senators were more forthright in their criticism of the Fed's
decision. Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader, called it unwise and
Senator Paul Sarbanes, who will take over next year as chairman of the
banking committee, urged the Fed to 'leave the economy alone'.
'The economy is doing pretty well but every time the Fed takes the rates up
it dampens economic activity,' he said.
Many business groups share this concern.
But the financial markets side firmly with the Fed on the need to deal with
brewing signs of inflation. Even an increase of a quarter of a percentage
point yesterday would have been greeted with disappointment as a sign that
the Fed was 'behind the curve' on inflation.
The members of the Federal Open Market Committee are less godlike in their
certitude than the markets. They appear to have taken to heart Oliver
Cromwell's advice to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland: 'I
beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be
mistaken.'
Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, put it a little differently last week
in testimony to a congressional committee last week.
'Policy making requires an assessment of the consequences of various policy
alternatives should they prove to be wrong. We must ask ourselves: how
difficult would it be to reverse policy mistakes and at what cost?'
The committee also includes five presidents of regional Federal Reserve
banks. They stay in close touch with business leaders in their districts,
and several of them have in recent weeks made a concerted effort to justify
higher interest rates in speeches to community leaders and chambers of
commerce.
Fed officials say they have not been fully convinced by signs of an economic
slowdown in some recent statistics, such as the large increase in business
inventories in the second quarter, and argue that the capacity of the job
market and industrial plant to absorb more demand is becoming stretched.
The Fed said yesterday that its half point increase in rates was 'expected
to be sufficient, at least for a time, to meet the objective of sustained,
non-inflationary growth.'
That probably averts the likelihood of further tightening at next month's
committee meeting, but does not appear to rule out the possibility of
another increase before the end of the year.

<TEXT>
Colombia's prosecutor-general said yesterday that an investigation had found
no proof that drug traffickers financed the election campaigns this year of
President Ernesto Samper and of his main rival, Mr Andres Pastrana, Reuter
reports from Bogota.
'It was not proven that money from drug trafficking reached the presidential
campaigns, fortunately for Colombian democracy,' Mr Gustavo de Greiff said
in a radio interview.
He had launched an investigation in June after allegations, based on
audio-cassette tapes, that the heads of the country's most powerful cocaine
trafficking organisation, the Cali cartel, offered cash to Mr Samper's
campaign.
The allegations, which came only days after Mr Samper's victory on June 19
in a close contest, caused uproar in Colombia and led to severe questioning
in the US of the country's commitment to the global war against the illicit
trade in drugs.
The cassettes were made public by Mr Pastrana after his defeat, although
they also contained an ambiguous reference to drug money in his campaign.
Both Mr Pastrana and Mr Samper vigorously denied that their campaigns had
received any drug money.
Marxist guerrillas in Colombia killed seven members of an anti-drug police
patrol on Monday, in an ambush in a mountainous area of the south-western
department of Cauca used for growing opium poppies, a police official said
yesterday.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Mexican Elections: One eye on the observers - The quest,
aided by the UN, for a free and fair poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With Mexico about to face the most closely watched presidential poll in its
history, the impartiality of the 32,000 electoral observers who will help
assess the legitimacy of the result has come under the spotlight.
The governing Institutional Revolutionary party has long claimed that some
observers are politically partisan and that their findings are not
necessarily to be trusted. It points to the links between the best-known
observer groups and the leftist Party of Democratic Revolution as evidence
of possible bias.
However, the emergence of new observer organisations linked to the PRI has
led to the opposite accusation. The PRI is alleged to have created its own
observer groups as a counterweight to existing organisations, to make sure
that at least some observers say the elections are clean.
The observers do not have any formal authority to qualify electoral results.
But they have been given legal status for the first time ever in a Mexican
election, and are allowed a free hand to scrutinise the electoral process at
the country's 96,000 voting booths. They are expected to play a key role in
influencing public opinion's assessment of the electoral process.
The national observers will be joined by several hundred foreign 'visitors',
admitted for the first time by Mexico. The visitors have much the same
rights as national observers, although foreigners cannot interfere in the
voting process itself.
The debate over the observers in part reflects continued lack of trust in
the electoral process, despite government efforts to reform the system.
In principle there should be few differences of opinion between the 14 main
observer groups. All are being advised by a technical team from the UN, and
will be using similar methodology when observing the electoral process. They
have just signed a pact committing them to impartiality and objectivity when
scrutinising the election.
However, party officials and the UN accept the possibility that different
organisations may reach separate conclusions on the legitimacy of the
process, creating at the very least confusion in the mind of the public.
'This is a concern for us,' says Nguyen Huu Dong, the UN official who is
advising Mexican observer groups, 'but there is no solution. No one can stop
observers participating. If they use a good methodology and care about their
reputation we can avoid problems.'
The best known observer organisation, Civic Alliance, is made up of several
hundred human rights and pro-democracy groups, and is given high marks by Mr
Dong for professionalism. It has been aggressive in monitoring pre-electoral
conditions, criticising biased media coverage of the election and government
support for the ruling party, more so than the UN would have liked.
On the day of the election, Civic Alliance hopes to have thousands of
observers watching polling booths and looking out for fraud. It is
organising its own 'quick count' of a sample of representative polls, to
make any tampering with the final result, as some suspect may have happened
in the 1988 election, more difficult.
The PRI is generally mistrustful of Civic Alliance, reckoning it is too
close to the leftist PRD (some members of Civic Alliance affiliates are
running for Congress for the leftist PRD). Mr Fernando Lerdo de Tejada, a
prominent PRI congressman, recently complained in a newspaper article that
'a large number of the groups of observers are protagonists for a political
party, which reduces their trustworthiness . . . and raises the question
whether they form part of the post-electoral strategy expressly devised by
some parties'.
Mr Enrique Calderon of the Alliance says: 'It is legitimate to identify us
with the opposition. We are observers because we are not in agreement with
system.'
But he firmly denies there will be any bias in reporting what volunteers
see. He points out that the Alliance has received a large grant from the UN
(and therefore indirectly from the Mexican government, which has funded the
UN observer project).
In what some see as an effort to reduce Civic Alliance's influence, other
observer groups have sprung up in recent months. The Mexican teachers' union
will field about 13,000 accredited observers and, thanks to the union's deep
pockets, these will be among the best organised. But this union is formally
affiliated to the PRI, which makes many in the opposition suspicious of its
independence.
Proceso, a news magazine, reported this week links between the PRI and the
head of the National Democratic Crusade, another observer group. One of
Democratic Crusade's members recently claimed in a press release: 'The
changes that have been made in electoral legislation and the inclusion of
citizen advisers (in the electoral authorities) makes us certain that there
will be transparency, legality and legitimacy in the electoral process'.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Strong expansion in Mexico: Public spending rises in run-up
to presidential election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's finance ministry has announced, in the run-up to the presidential
election on Sunday, that the economy grew by a stronger than expected 3.8
per cent in the second quarter, compared to the equivalent period last year.
This was the fastest quarterly growth by Mexico for two years.
The figures are likely to be taken by the ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party, favoured to win the election, as firm evidence the economic
difficulties of the past year are over. Mexico's economy grew by just 0.4
per cent last year, and contracted in the second part of the year.
The expansion in the second quarter this year brings growth for the first
half to 2.2 per cent, compared to the equivalent period last year. The
industrial sector grew by 2.3 per cent in the first six months, with
manufacturing up by 1.2 per cent, the first increase in more than a year.
Agriculture grew by a robust 5.1 per cent, and services by 2 per cent.
A government official said he now expected growth of 2.5 to 3 per cent this
year. The consensus private-sector forecast for economic growth was between
1 and 2 per cent before the latest figures.
The government separately announced a large increase in public spending in
the first half, which contributed to the pick-up in the economy. Public
spending reached 148.6bn pesos (Dollars 43.8bn) in the first half, an
increase of 11.4 per cent on the equivalent period in 1993. Social spending
rose by 8.8 per cent, while public investment climbed by 27.6 per cent,
partly thanks to new federal government public works projects.
The public sector is expected by the finance ministry to show a balanced
budget this year, as was originally forecast. However, the increased
spending cut the public sector's budgetary surplus in the first half to
5.42bn pesos, less than half the surplus of a year ago.
Economic growth was further lifted by expansion of manufacturing exports and
investment. Gross investment increased by 5.9 per cent in the four months to
April, while manufacturing exports grew by 25 per cent to May.
Despite the growth in manufacturing exports, at the end of May the trade
deficit reached Dollars 7.242bn - 26 per cent more than the equivalent
period last year. Unlike last year, the rate of growth of imports (19.3 per
cent) exceeded overall growth in exports (17.3 per cent).
The faster economic growth appears to have played a part in the
deterioration in the trade position.

FT  17 AUG 94 / US pension funds benefit from foreign holdings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US pension funds earned an average return of 11.3 per cent on their
investment portfolios last year, outperforming US stock markets, according
to a new survey.
The Wyatt Company, a leading pension and benefits consulting firm, said the
performance reflected the funds' holdings of non-US stocks and bonds. The
average US pension scheme held 9 per cent of its total assets in
non-domestic securities. Of this, 7 per cent were in equities and a further
2 per cent in fixed income securities.
Over the past three years, US pension funds have returned an average of 14.8
per cent annually.
Of the 12 countries surveyed, pension schemes in all countries increased
their weightings in equities. Malaysian funds, for instance, increased their
average weighting in equities from 27 per cent last year to 62 per cent a
year later.
Median balanced pension fund returns, adjusted for local currencies, were
highest last year in Malaysia, where they totalled 91 per cent.
Hong Kong provided the second highest returns, and pension funds there
earned an average return of 53.3 per cent. The country whose pension funds
earned the lowest returns was Japan, where the average fund earned only 5.1
per cent, the survey said.

<TEXT>
The pace of new housing construction in the US picked up last month, the
Commerce Department reported yesterday.
Housing starts rose by 5 per cent in July to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 1.115m, the department said, after falling by 9 per cent the
previous month.
Market economists said that the figure was somewhat stronger than had been
generally expected by most analysts, but still gave indications that higher
mortgage rates were taking a toll on the strength of the housing
construction market.
Although the July pace of housing starts was 14 per cent higher than a year
earlier, it still showed a drop of 12 per cent from the peak seasonally
adjusted rate of more than 1.6m starts reached last December.
Construction of new single family homes remained relatively weak, and much
of the strength in July came from multi-family buildings such as flats and
semi-detached homes.
Housing starts rebounded in the west and mid-west, where they had fallen
sharply in June, but declined slightly in the south and north-east.
Building permits, which can provide an advance indication of home
construction trends, rose by 2 per cent in July after seasonal adjustment,
after falling by 3 per cent in June. Again, fewer permits were issued for
single family homes, with most of the strength in the multi-family dwelling
sector.
Overall, analysts said the numbers confirmed the likelihood that residential
construction would contribute little to overall economic growth this
quarter.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden's consumer price index was static in July compared with June, the
second consecutive month of unchanged prices, according to figures from the
national statistics agency. The July figure brought the year-on-year
inflation rate to 2.9 per cent, up from 2.6 per cent the month before but
down from the previous July's 4.6 per cent. The agency said that price
increases in some areas in July had offset declines elsewhere. Higher
interest rates, and higher prices for fresh fruit, vegetables and coffee
raised consumer prices by 0.3 percentage points in the month. This had been
wholly offset by lower clothing prices. In the first seven months of 1994,
Swedish consumer prices rose by 1.8 per cent, the agency said.
Spain's producer price index rose 4.3 per cent in June compared with the
same month last year, the national statistics institute reported. Prices
went up by an accumulated 2.6 per cent since December. Those of chemical
products and minerals not used for energy showed the highest rise - 6.3 per
cent in June from the same month a year earlier. The same prices rose by 0.5
per cent in June from May.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Japanese minister kills 'part-time' job prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
This morning, about 2,500 young Japanese women will receive a letter
containing the words which job-seekers everywhere know only too well: 'Thank
you for your interest. We will keep your application on file'.
But the letter will arrive by express delivery and will go on to explain
that Japan Airlines, whose press advertisement for contract posts as flight
attendants they had answered, has been prevented by the Transport Ministry
from hiring them.
JAL said yesterday it had grounded a plan to employ most new cabin crew on
short-term contracts after Mr Shizuka Kamei, transport minister, argued last
week this could endanger on-board safety.
The lossmaking flag carrier was aiming - along with All Nippon Airways and
Japan Air System, its domestic competitors - to pay such recruits by the
hour, describing them as part-timers.
Although they would normally work a full week, they would be unlikely to
earn even a third of the salaries enjoyed by the career cabin staff with
whom they were to share the aisles. Mr Kamei implied that such disparities
would create two classes of employee who might not work together in
sufficient harmony to be able to deal with an in-flight emergency.
The Japanese airline industry, where training is rigorous and the safety
record good, was indignant. But faced with a threat by Mr Kamei to deny
applications for new routes if carriers persisted in the plan, JAL relented
yesterday and the others are expected to follow suit.
JAL, anxious to cut costs, insists the scheme has merely been put in a
holding pattern while it addresses the ministry's concerns.
For Mr Kamei, who comes from the Liberal Democratic party, these worries may
extend beyond safety to the effect the move would have in further eroding
the system of lifetime employment - regarded by his party as a foundation of
Japanese economic success under its 37-year conservative rule.
After a year out of office, the LDP is back as the dominant force in a
three-party coalition headed by Mr Tomiichi Murayama. The prime minister's
Social Democratic party draws much of its support from public sector unions
which are also keen to retain employment protection.
JAL, privatised in the 1980s, intended to employ an initial 100 stewardesses
on contract terms. Not only would they be paid much less, but if business
got any worse the airline could shed them, unlike its 6,000 salaried cabin
crew. Over the next four years the company is trying to reduce that number
to 4,600 but cannot force any to go.
The 100 women would have been hired through a charter subsidiary in order to
avoid direct wage comparisons, and would have been restricted, at first
anyway, to domestic routes.
The fact that there were 25 applicants for every post indicates the high
level of female unemployment in Japan as the country reaches the end of its
longest post-war recession. Women graduates complain that they are again at
the back of the queue for most jobs, after a period of labour shortage made
more companies hire on merit. Most work on offer for them is part-time.
And at JAL now, not even that. At a televised news conference yesterday a
company executive, announcing that the plan had been suspended, could only
say: 'We are sorry if we have brought hardship to the people who applied.'

FT  17 AUG 94 / Nigerian high court judge quits Abiola trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ABUJA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The judge presiding over the treason trial of opposition politician Chief
Moshood Abiola walked out of the case yesterday, dashing union expectations
he would be freed and prolonging Nigeria's political crisis.
More protest strikes look imminent, especially among fellow members of Mr
Abiola's Yoruba tribe in Lagos and south-western Nigeria, while the
crippling oil industry strike enters its seventh week.
Mr Abiola, on trial for treason after declaring himself president, remains
in custody in Abuja after Mr Mohammed Mustapha ruled that the federal high
court in the capital was competent to try him for offences alleged to have
taken place in Lagos, but that he himself was not.
Mr Mustapha said that he had lost the confidence of the defence lawyers and
withdrew from the case.
'What he has done is judicial hara-kiri,' said Mr Alao Aka-Bashorun, a
leading counsel for the defence. 'He has been found guilty of mishandling
the trial. If so, how can he give this ruling? Since his incompetence in the
case preceded today's ruling it becomes null and void.'
At a previous hearing on August 3, the judge said he had to consult people
outside the court before giving today's ruling and was promptly challenged
by Mr Abiola and his defence.
The federal high court in Abuja was set up just before the case opened in
July and Mr Mustapha was transferred there from a court in Benin. On August
5 the judge granted bail in the absence of Mr Abiola and his lawyers on
terms which were rejected by the defendant.
'It is clear that this judge is in collusion with the government,' said one
of Mr Abiola's large team of lawyers after the hearing yesterday.
'The government wants a prolonged trial,' Mr Aka-Bashorun said. 'We are
convinced that they have no evidence to convict him.'
As well as undermining the judiciary, yesterday's outcome has further
discredited the national leadership of the Nigeria Labour Congress.
Its president, Mr Paschal Bafyau, has three times delayed or suspended a
general strike in protest at Mr Abiola's detention following assurances by
General Sani Abacha's regime that the deposed winner of last year's
presidential poll would be released.
The oil workers' strike began unilaterally and has cut crude oil production
by at least one quarter of its 2m barrels a day capacity and severely
disrupted fuel distribution.

<TEXT>
Sri Lanka's opposition People's Alliance appeared to be ahead early today in
the island's parliamentary election, opening the door to the possibility of
the ruling United National Party's first defeat in 17 years, according to
unofficial returns.
Final election results were not expected until later today and there have
been no reliable opinion polls. The UNP has won every national election
since 1977 but political analysts said the socialist People's Alliance
appeared to have a chance of winning.
Early this morning unnamed officials were quoted as saying that the
five-party opposition alliance had won approaching half the 160 electoral
precincts from which the 225 members of parliament will be chosen in a
complex system of direct election and proportional representation.
Yesterday the government imposed a state of emergency and over 40,000
policemen and thousands of soldiers patrolled the streets to prevent more of
the violence that scarred a campaign in which 24 died.
The opposition coalition has promised to restructure the government by
stripping the presidency of many of its powers so the prime minister and
parliament would have more control. It pledged to negotiate with guerrillas
fighting for a Tamil homeland. More than 30,000 people have been killed in
the 11-year-old revolt.
Over 75 per cent of Sri Lanka's 11m voters cast ballots, officials said.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Suharto seeks to quadruple per capita income

<TEXT>
Indonesia aims to quadruple per capita income over the next 25 years,
through industrial development, President Suharto said yesterday.
In a speech to mark Indonesia's 49th independence day he said that to
achieve the target (from Dollars 650 per capita income now) gross domestic
product growth rates would have to average 7 per cent a yearagainst average
annual GDP growth of 6 per cent over the past 25 years.
'The industrial sector has become the prime mover of development,' Mr
Suharto said. 'It is industry that becomes the main vehicle for
technological development which can eventually lead us to emerge as a modern
nation.'
A debate continues between thosewho want government to channel more funds
into heavy industry and technocrats who argue that many of these industries
would find little comparative advantage in Indonesia.
President Suharto, who has ruled over Indonesia's 14,000 islands over the
past quarter century said reducing poverty would be one of the main future
challenges and industrial development would help solve this.
Indonesian academics say the growing gap between rich and poor in a country
of 190m people, represents one of the biggest threats to political
stability. In turn Mr Suharto said political stability was necessary to
ensure continuing growth.
In a reference to the recent forced closures of three leading political
publications, Mr Suharto said that openness did not mean unlimited freedom.
'Even democracy has its rules,' Mr Suharto said. 'Without rules and without
their observance, what will emerge is anarchy, not democracy.'
In June the government closed two popular weekly magazines, Tempo and
Editor, and a weekly tabloid, DeTik, for their reporting on the debates
raging between the ruling elite about the acquisition of a fleet of former
East German warships. The papers were accused of ex-acerbating the debates
by pitting politicians against each other.
The president said Indonesia would continue to deregulate its economy and to
reduce the bureaucracy. However this 'certainly does not meansetting up a
liberal economic system that allows free competition,' he said. Many
Indonesian industries remain heavily regulated and protected largely because
they are controlled by politically well-connected businessmen.

Mr Nabil Shaath, chief PLO negotiator, said the two sides agreed to add
value added tax to the powers Palestinians will take over from Israel -
education, health, social welfare, tourism and direct taxation. Mr Shaath
also said Israel would start today to transfer to the Palestinian treasury
75 per cent of income tax collected from Palestinian migrant labourers
working in Israel. Israel and Jordan initialed an agreement to export
Dollars 30m (Pounds 19m) worth of goods to Palestinians in the occupied West
Bank this year, Jordan's chief peace negotiator Fayez al-Tarawneh said
yesterday, Reuter adds from Amman.

Japan yesterday protested to Moscow after a Japanese fishing boat in
disputed waters was fired on by Russian coastguards and its crew detained,
Gordon Cramb reports. At the same time, Moscow launched legal proceedings
against the captain of the boat that was hit by Russian gunfire off the
disputed Kurile islands off north-eastern Japan on Monday. One crew member
was injured in the incident.
The Kuriles were seized by the Soviet Union at the end of the second world
war and their status continues to bedevil relations between Japan and
Russia. In Moscow Mr Koji Watanabe, the Japanese ambassador, called on Mr
Alexander Panov, Russian deputy foreign minister, to complain about the
'highly regrettable shooting and seizure'. Russian reports said two unmarked
boats were fishing in its waters and when challenged, ignored warning shots
and attempted to head for home.

A Japanese utility yesterday restarted a 22-year-old nuclear reactor which
had been shut for three and a half years after a broken pipe caused one of
the most serious alerts in the country's civil nuclear programme, Gordon
Cramb reports from Tokyo.
The pressurised water reactor at Mihama, north of Kyoto, has been overhauled
since the February 1991 incident which released 55 tonnes of radioactive
water from the primary cooling system into the secondary system which powers
its turbine. For the first time in Japan, emergency core-cooling procedures
were activated to avoid a potential meltdown. The Ministry of International
Trade and Industry concluded an anti-vibration bar had been incorrectly
installed. Local residents and Japan's vocal green lobby protested at the
decision by Kansai Electric Power, the second largest electric utility, to
restart the 500MW facility.
Japan draws about 30 per cent of its electricity needs from nuclear power
supplied from its 46 reactors.
Tokyo department store sales fell 2.9 per cent last month compared with the
previous July, a 29th successive monthly fall. The decrease, although less
than June's 3.4 per cent fall, came in spite of income tax cuts, summer
promotions and good weather.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Taiwan-China links urged by shipping chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Chang Jung-fa, chairman of Taiwan's Evergreen Group, has called on the
Taiwan government to 'separate politics from economics' and open direct
shipping and air links to China, saying Taiwan's economic future hinged on
direct ties.
In a rare interview published yesterday in the Chinese-language Commercial
Times, the founder of one of the the world's biggest shipping companies and
Taiwan's first private international airline voiced the frustration of
Taiwan's business sector at being forced to route trade and investment
through Hong Kong.
'A few years ago, virtually all of China's trade went through Hong Kong, and
Evergreen was able to compete with other companies,' Mr Chang, who has
heretofore refrained from publicly opposing government policy, was quoted as
saying.
'Now shipping firms from all countries are setting up bases and routes to
the mainland, and Evergreen has to rely on Hong Kong alone.'
He also warned that, because of Hong Kong's reversion to Chinese sovereignty
in 1997, Taiwan must face up to and resolve the problem of direct links. 'If
not, when the time arrives, not only will there be problems with flights to
Hong Kong, there will also be problems with shipping to Hong Kong,' he said.
In a country where business leaders exert exceptional influence on
government policy, Mr Chang's remarks are a clear sign of growing pressure
on the government to address the question of direct links to China. Taiwan
has formally banned direct political and economic ties since 1949.
There are sharp divisions within government ranks over the question of
cross-strait shipping and air links, with three cabinet ministers advocating
their speedy resumption on the grounds that such a move is necessary for
Taiwan to remain economically viable.
On Monday, Mr Vincent Siew, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning
and Development, the top planning agency, told Prime Minister Lien Chan that
direct links were key to the realisation of Taiwan's oft-stated ambition of
becoming a regional centre for business and finance.
Taiwan's existing five-year air rights agreement with the colony expires on
April 30 next year. Talks between Taiwan's China Airlines and Hong
Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways to renew the agreement appear to have
broken down. Hong Kong newspapers reported on Monday that Beijing was
insisting on having a final say on any new air rights agreement with the
colony extending past 1997.
Mr Chang wants his airline, EVA Air, founded in 1991, to fly to China's main
cities and is trying to gain access to the lucrative route between Taipei
and Hong Kong, currently dominated by CAL and Cathay.
Taiwan has invested an estimated Dollars 15bn (Pounds 9.7bn) in China since
the early 1980s and some 12,000 Taiwan companies have set up operations in
China.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Property developers go to town in Jakarta: But their
enthusiasm has led to a glut in the luxury market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MANUELA SARAGOSA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the matter of a few years the shanty towns in centre of Jakarta have been
replaced by high-rise office blocks, luxury apartments and five-star hotels,
and rice paddies in the greater Jakarta area have been replaced with
industrial estates and satellite towns.
The property sector has been one of the fastest growing in the country, with
most of the larger Indonesian conglomerates capitalising on their land
assets and jumping on the bandwagon for real-estate development.
So enthusiastic are property developers in Indonesia that they are now
hoping to convince the government to approve a project involving the
complete clean-up and rebuilding of Jakarta's 32km-long waterfront.
In the first six months of this year, BKPM, Indonesia's Investment
Co-ordinating Board, approved about Dollars 2.5bn worth of domestic
investment projects in the construction, hotel and restaurant, housing and
office sectors, which made up 16 per cent of total domestic investment
approvals to July 15. Most of these projects are in and around Jakarta.
However, oversupply is setting in and Jakarta's property market looks likely
to experience some hard times.
'A massive glut could occur in 1996 for office space and it could take three
or four years to clear,' said a Jakarta-based broker.
Office rents have already been lowered and some landlords are hoping to
pre-empt any difficulties by offering existing tenants cheap rentals in an
attempt to lure them into leasing more space.
Meanwhile, after the building sprees of previous years, industrial estates
are finding it difficult to stir up interest in their lots. The estates were
hit by a drop in foreign investment last year and some brokers point out
that many are suffering setbacks because they are unable to guarantee a
steady supply of electricity.
Rentals and sales of residential apartments are also slumping. An excess of
supply in the luxury residential apartment market has caused the overall
average occupancy rate in Jakarta to fall to 81 per cent in June from 91 per
cent at the beginning of the year. This has been made worse by developers'
unwillingness to reduce rental rates and the fact that 'luxury' is not
always an accurate description.
With the outlook for luxury apartments looking bleak, the Indonesian
government is considering opening the market to individual foreign buyers.
To date, foreigners have only been allowed to rent property in Indonesia.
Property consultants say they expect new legislation on this within the next
six months.
'A lot of developers see that if foreigners were to buy houses then demand
for their property would really pick up,' said Mr Craig Williams, director
of PT Procon Indah, a property consultancy that works in association with
Jones Lang Wootton.
However, foreigners are unlikely to buy what Indonesians will not. In its
most recent survey of the Jakarta property market, PT Procon Indah noted
that developers often do not meet construction schedules, workmanship is of
poor quality, and materials and fittings are inadequate. Other consultants
also point out that safety standards are practically non-existent.
Meanwhile, government officials complain of a continuing shortage in
housing. Policy dictates that for every luxury house a developer builds, it
must also construct three middle-income houses and six low-income houses.
But that regulation is ignored.
Middle income housing which caters to people earning between Dollars 1,500
and Dollars 3,000 a month, is the only sector offering significant growth
prospects, even though Indonesia's middle class is not as huge a pool of
buyers as it could be.
The problem lies mainly in financing house purchases. There are no long-term
interest rates in Indonesia which discourages banks from making long-term
loans. The result is that most buyers of middle-income houses are
speculators and this is 'a class which is traditionally not as stable as
first-time buyers', a Jakarta-based broker said.
Property development has been opened to full foreign ownership with the most
recent deregulation package that loosened restrictions on foreign
investment.
Most foreign developers, however, prefer to enter the market in a joint
venture with an Indonesian company. Laws governing land titles in Indonesia
are complex, with the purchase of land not necessarily confering the right
to ownership. The process of acquiring land can become a messy affair and
stories abound of shanty-town dwellers who have been forcibly removed and
inadequately compensated for their land.
Despite the prospects, developers have commissioned a study that attempts to
convince Jakarta's authorities to develop the city's waterfront into a new
city centre, complete with office towers and residential housing.
At present this neglected district of Jakarta is not a pretty sight.
Untreated sewage pours out into an already polluted, black and oily sea,
shanty towns with little or no sewage facilities perch on the coastline,
prostitutes solicit on grubby beaches at night and the area suffers from a
chronic shortage of drinking water.
The project, if approved, would cost about Dollars 20bn and would involve
all the existing big waterfront developers, including Dharmala Intiland, a
listed property developer.
If it is approved, it is difficult to see where financing for the
development would come from. Development banks are expected to make some
contribution but state-owned banks have been told to stop financing property
development projects, although it is not clear whether this is being
enforced.
As one property analyst says, 'developers are incredibly ambitious but their
expectations are not always realistic'.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An appeal was lodged yesterday against last month's decision by an Italian
judge to drop bribery charges levelled at top executives of Fiat, the giant
Italian industrial company.
Mr Francesco Misiani, a Rome investigating magistrate, wants to overturn the
decision not to send Mr Cesare Romiti, Fiat chief executive, Mr Francesco
Mattioli, finance director, and Mr Umberto Beliazzi, head of the company's
Rome office, for trial.
The trio were among 61 people facing charges that they paid bribes of more
than L100bn (Pounds 40m) to political parties - particularly the Socialists
and Christian Democrats - to win contracts for building Rome's underground
railway system.
Mr Bettino Craxi, a former Socialist prime minister who is living in
Tunisia, was one of those sent for trial.
According to Italian news agency reports, Mr Misiani's 18-page deposition to
the Rome appeal court alleges that 'within the Fiat group the initiative for
paying bribes was taken by the top managers'. All three executives have
denied the charges.
Executives in Fiat's construction subsidiaries have already come under
suspicion for bribery and at least one has confessed. But Mr Misiani
maintains that the subsidiaries' managers were only 'the last link in the
chain' which began with Mr Romiti and Mr Mattioli.
Milan magistrates have also asked for Mr Mattioli to be sent for trial in
connection with bribes paid to political parties for Milan public transport
authority contracts.
Fiat confirmed last year that it had paid L50bn (Pounds 20m) in bribes to
politicians and their intermediaries over the past 10 years. It claimed
managers were obliged to pay, otherwise the company would have been forced
out of certain markets, such as the public procurement sector.
Separately, Mr Craxi - sentenced in his absence to eight and half years in
jail in another corruption case last month - yesterday blamed
anti-corruption investigators for the mild heart attack suffered at the
weekend by his brother-in-law, Mr Paolo Pillitteri, former Socialist mayor
of Milan. Mr Pillitteri, who is now recovering in hospital, was sentenced to
four and a half years in jail in June for taking bribes. He is said to be
working on the screenplay of a film about the mani pulite (clean hands)
investigation.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Unilever launches cash back scheme in soap war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, has raised the financial
stakes in its continuing 'soap war' with US rival Procter &amp; Gamble by
offering hefty rebates to Dutch consumers who buy its new washing powder.
For this week only, shoppers in the Netherlands are being offered a Fl 10
(Pounds 3.70) rebate on the normal Fl 16.85 price of a packet of Omo Power.
Unilever claims the new powder has revolutionary cleaning power, but P&amp;G
says it damages clothes after repeated washings.
The rebate scheme is limited to the Netherlands, where Unilever has suffered
most heavily from P&amp;G's claims. There are currently no plans to extend the
temporary price cuts to Britain, where the powder is sold as Persil Power,
or to other European markets.
Unilever described the rebate as a normal marketing instrument designed to
win customers for a new product. A smaller Fl 3 rebate had been offered on
some packets when Omo Power was launched in the Netherlands last April.
In early June, Dutch sales of Omo Power were hit hard after P&amp;G's claims
first surfaced in a Rotterdam-based newspaper, but a spokesman said
yesterday that sales in the Netherlands had picked up again in recent weeks.
He declined to say whether sales had recovered to levels seen before the
feud, or to give details of how much the rebates were expected to cost
Unilever. The company said last week that market share had risen in the UK
and France despite the controversy about the new powder.
In large newspaper advertisements this week, Dutch consumers who buy Omo
Power have been told to send the bar code from the packet to the company,
together with an application form printed on the advertisement and a receipt
from the supermarket to prove that the powder was purchased this week. The
Fl 10, plus the cost of postage, would then be transferred to their bank
account.
Unilever's advertisements make much of independent tests into the
effectiveness of Omo Power, whose composition was adjusted after P&amp;G argued
that the powder's manganese-based accelerator could harm clothing. However,
Unilever says its product has been a success. 'That's why we want to treat
you - to Fl 10,' the advertisements say.
Some analysts had expected the unusually public war between the world's two
leading soap manufacturers to affect Unilever's second quarter results.
However, the company on Friday revealed a better-than-expected rise in
profits, with no obvious effect from the row.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Berlusconi earns short break in the sun: But his political
and economic problems are not set to go away
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the first time this summer, it looks as though Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the
Italian prime minister, can relax and enjoy a few days at the seaside resort
of Portofino, near Genoa.
After the turbulence of last Thursday and Friday, Italian financial markets
were calm yesterday - either snoozing after the Monday bank holiday, or
tranquilised by television pictures at the weekend of Mr Berlusconi
arm-in-arm with Mr Umberto Bossi, his coalition partner and principal
critic, in the garden of the prime minister's villa near Milan.
The main Italian equity indices rose by 1.4 per cent yesterday, bond yields
were almost unchanged, and the Italian lira stabilised at around L1,023
against the D-Mark, ahead of yesterday's US Federal Reserve meeting. Dire
warnings of a Black Tuesday to follow Black Thursday and Friday did not
materialise.
Analysts, however, warned that by patching up the cracks which had appeared
in the governing coalition, Mr Berlusconi had only won his government a
breathing space. 'Bossi and Berlusconi being friends again is not going to
solve the issue; it's just a palliative,' said Mr Andrea Ruggeri of Goldman
Sachs yesterday.
The issue, in this case, is how the government will tackle the country's
looming public debt, which stands at about 120 per cent of gross domestic
product. Last month, the government confirmed that it would aim to cut the
deficit from L154,000bn (Pounds 62.4bn) this year, to L138,600bn in 1995,
but it postponed key decisions on the detail of budget measures until
September, to the disappointment of industry and investors.
That partly explains why markets reacted so nervously last week to
indications that all was not well in the government coalition. Apart from Mr
Bossi's well-publicised criticisms of alleged political misjudgments, some
ministers hinted they would not accept the heavy cuts in pensions spending,
needed if Italy is to balance its books.
The efforts of the Bank of Italy to defend the currency with half-point
interest rate rises on Thursday evening turned out in the end to be
counter-productive, although the move may have served to remind the prime
minister that firm action will be necessary to avoid further rate rises.
Mr Berlusconi has had to work hard in order to achieve even the latest
fragile political peace, using all his experience as a media magnate to
soothe the Italian people, first with a series of
you've-never-had-it-so-good television interviews on Friday night, then with
the ostensibly good-humoured garden press conference with Mr Bossi on
Saturday.
In the meantime, he and his aides have continued to whip less co-operative
coalition members into line with firm hints that opposition to the
government is unpatriotic, and dark warnings that allies of the left,
disgruntled after losing the March general election, are pulling against the
interests of the country.
Even with this effort, some observers pointed out yesterday that the markets
had merely frozen at the levels reached at the end of last week, rather than
recovered, as Mr Berlusconi might have hoped. 'There's a lot of indecision
in the marketplace after the holiday, but the tone hasn't really changed,'
said Mr Carlo Cimino of the Milan investment firm Aloisio Foglia Ventura.
In the longer term, most analysts are still broadly optimistic about the
Italian economy, and if Mr Berlusconi can win round his coalition allies to
support a tough budget for 1995, they say he will be rewarded. For the time
being, however, in line with the holiday spirit, the markets are simply
treading water.

The bottle is running low for one of Russia's top vodka-makers. Bankruptcy
officials have declared insolvent the Kristall joint-stock company, maker of
Stolichnaya and two dozen other brands of the national drink. Kristall has
debts of Rbs6.7bn, and the state, which owns 51 per cent of the company,
plans to help restructure it. Company officials disputed the ruling and said
they had appealed to the city and federal governments. For centuries the
government had a monopoly on vodka sales. In February, the state lowered
excise duties on Russian vodka to try to help the troubled domestic
industry. Russian distillers have been struggling to adapt to a new market
awash with foreign brands.

Poland's central bank has criticised the government's inflation target for
next year as unrealistic. Mr Witold Kozinski, deputy president, told Nowa
Europa newspaper that the 16 per cent target was unrealistic after this
year's 27-28 per cent rate. The government's outline budget, he said, seemed
to indicate a sharp rise in central bank financing of the deficit. Unless
that share was reduced, the inflation rate would not be brought down. Mr
Kozinski called for more information on what the government's financing
requirements might be so that the bank could help.

Police at a Siberian airport have seized bags stuffed with 1,300kg of cash
worth Rbs7bn (Pounds 2.2m at the market rate). The six sacks were to have
been flown by special aircraft from Irkutsk to Volgograd in central Russia,
according to Itar-Tass news agency. The Irkutsk deputy governor said there
were no documents for the cargo, which was traced to an investment firm
called The Russian House of Selenga. A year ago, a Volgograd court ruled
that the firm was operating illegally but it has continued to take
investors' money, according to the Rossiyskaya Gazeta newspaper. On Tuesday
the firm placed advertisements in Volgograd newspapers informing
shareholders it was suspending operations, but promising to return their
money. The firm's activities are under investigation.

Mr Elco Brinkman (left) resigned yesterday as Christian Democrat leader in
the lower house of the Dutch parliament in a delayed response to the party's
record losses in last May's general election. His departure comes days
before the expected inauguration of a coalition government that will exclude
the Christian Democrats from power for the first time in modern Dutch
politics. His successor, not yet named, will effectively become leader of
the opposition. The new government is to be formed by Mr Wim Kok, the Labour
leader. Mr Ruud Lubbers, the outgoing Dutch prime minister, chose Mr
Brinkman as heir apparent within the Christian Democrat party when he
decided not to stand for a record fourth term in office. However, Mr
Brinkman never managed to achieve Mr Lubbers' authority or popularity, and
the party saw its seats in the 150-seat parliament cut to 34 from 54 in the
election.

European flights face increased delays after a two-year period of
improvement, the Association of European Airlines said yesterday. During the
first half of this year, just over 11 per cent of intra-European flights
were 15 minutes or more late - 'reasonably good' figures in the AEA's view
and down on the same period last year. 'The improvement was all in the first
quarter, however, with a steady deterioration since then,' it said. The
association's secretary-general, Mr Karl-Heinz Neumeister, said
infrastructure deficiencies at airports and in air traffic control systems
caused 62 per cent of delays in June. 'The build-up of demand in summer
months is not a new phenomenon. The airlines cope with it. The tourism
industry copes with it. We lay on capacity appropriate to the demands of the
market. The infrastructure providers, all too evidently, do not,' he said.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Carlos' testimony could reveal guerrilla networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Carlos 'The Jackal', the international terrorist, was formally placed under
investigation for a 1982 bomb attack by a Paris judge yesterday amid hopes
that he would reveal details of guerrilla networks and concerns that his
arrest could prompt reprisals from extremist sympathisers.
Mr Charles Pasqua, the French interior minister, said that Carlos' testimony
could unveil links to guerrilla networks and foreign nations which support
terrorism. Responding to the potential security threat involved in detaining
Carlos, the interior minister said that 'the risks of attack naturally
exist. But measures have been taken.'
Mr Pasqua rejected allegations of a trade-off with Sudan to secure Carlos'
extradition. The claims included press reports that France had provided
Khartoum with surveillance photographs to help Sudan's Islamic government
combat rebels in the south of the country. A lawyer acting for Carlos also
claimed that he had been kidnapped from Sudan in a deal between Paris and
Khartoum.
Western diplomats in Paris said France had been cultivating contacts with
Sudan recently with the aim of capturing Carlos. They said Sudan had
extradited Carlos to improve its standing in the west. Following Carlos's
arrest, Sudanese officials urged the US to remove Sudan from its blacklist
of states that support terrorism.
The arrest of Carlos represents a coup for the centre-right government of Mr
Edouard Balladur and for Mr Pasqua in particular. Mr Balladur claimed the
arrest, after collaboration between Sudan's security forces and the French
intelligence service, demonstrated France's tough stance against terrorism.
Mr Pasqua has been pursuing a crackdown against suspected Islamic extremists
following the killing of five French citizens in Algeria earlier this month.
A CSA poll showed that a majority of French people believe the measures
employed by Mr Pasqua, which have involved sweeping stop and check searches,
are an effective response to the threat of terrorism.
Carlos, whose real name is Illich Ramirez Sanchez, is due to face charges
relating to a 1982 bombing near the Champs Elysees in Paris in which one
person died and 63 were injured. The 1982 attack is the only one for which
France has issued a formal arrest warrant. Carlos was separately sentenced
to life imprisonment in his absence two years ago for the 1975 killings of
two French counter-intelligence agents.
Mr Pasqua said that Carlos himself had claimed responsibility for 83
killings, at least 15 of them in France in a career of terrorism which
started in 1970 when he joined the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine.
Appearing yesterday before Mr Jean-Louis Bruguiere, the anti-terrorist
judge, Carlos appeared calm and relaxed. 'We also had Famas (the French army
issue assault rifle) in Lebanon, they are good,' he told his guards.

FT  17 AUG 94 / German mobile phone licence blocked
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A German court prevented the federal government from awarding the first
in-flight mobile telephone licence to Deutsche Telekom, the state-owned
telecommunications monopoly.
The decision, late on Monday, will be seen as a setback for the government,
which is believed to be trying to help maximise Deutsche Telekom's market
position ahead of its partial privatisation, scheduled for early 1996. It
followed an injunction filed last week by Mercury, the British-based
telephone network, and Mannesmann, the German engineering conglomerate, in
which both had questioned the internal procedures used by the postal
ministry to award licences.
The ministry had awarded the licence last June to DeTeMobil, the mobile
telephone division of Deutsche Telekom, which pledged to invest more than
DM15m (Pounds 6.26m) in establishing a country-wide in-flight mobile
telephone system.
An official at the postal ministry said the award was made on the basis of a
points system, with DeTeMobil scoring higher than Mercury or Mannesmann, the
only other bidders.
Under German legislation the government is allowed to award licences through
a lottery system when two or more bids are considered equal. But in the case
of DeTeMobil, no lottery had taken place even though the Cologne
Administrative Court yesterday said it considered the bids from Mercury and
Mannesmann to have been just as competitive as DeTeMobil.
Mercury and Mannesmann had filed separate injunctions last week after they
had received information that the postal ministry had set out internal
guidelines which had not been available to either company when they
originally submitted their bids.
'We had not questioned the procedures and terms for applying for the licence
when they were issued earlier this year,' a Mercury spokesman said. 'Rather,
it was how the decision was taken internally (in the postal ministry) once
the evaluations had been made which we questioned.' He said Mercury had been
granted permission by the postal ministry to see those guidelines two weeks
ago, and nearly six weeks after DeTeMobil had been awarded the licence.
The decision by the court means that the government must either decide to
delay issuing the licences, review the entire procedure for awards, or else
challenge the court's decision. However, a Mercury spokesman said: 'It is
very likely that a lottery will be held because the scoring of the three
companies was so close.'
Meanwhile, Mercury claims to have successfully completed trials for
providing ground support for an in-flight mobile telephone network for
Lufthansa, Germany's national airline.

FT  17 AUG 94 / More plutonium seized in Germany: Man held in Bremen
allegedly carrying Russian 'sample' of nuclear material
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
An east German man was arrested in Bremen last weekend while attempting to
hand over a 'sample' of supposedly Russian plutonium to a German undercover
agent, it emerged yesterday.
Following last week's capture in Munich of two Spaniards and a Colombian
carrying some 300 grammes of plutonium on a Lufthansa flight from Moscow to
Munich, the news sparked instant demands from politicians for more
information and tighter links between federal and regional security forces.
Mr Bernd Schmidbauer, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's security adviser, who is to
visit the Russian capital later this week, will appear before a
parliamentary commission today.
The Bremen arrest prompted further Russian denials that its controls over
nuclear materials were not working. An official from the embassy in Bonn
claimed there was no evidence, only western prejudice. In Moscow, Russian
security officials attacked what they said were western attempts to
discredit the country's nuclear industry. They claimed foreign governments
were trying to exploit public concern caused by discoveries of weapons-grade
plutonium in Germany, to justify interference in Russia's internal affairs.
According to German legal officials, the Bremen arrest involves an unnamed
34-year-old living in Lower Saxony who had offered to supply up to 70g of
the plutonium. He also provided a certificate to prove its authenticity,
which suggested it came from a Moscow scientific institute.
According to preliminary analysis, the 2g 'sample' contained 0.05mg of mixed
plutonium and americium, elements commonly generated in nuclear power
reactors.
In a development suggesting tensions between the secret services and
civilian legal authorities, an unidentified man claiming to be the
undercover agent involved accused the arresting officers from the
prosecution service of interfering with his work.
He said in a television broadcast that the rest of the material could be
'wandering around north Germany'. However, the Bremen prosecutors said they
had arrested the man because of potential danger to the public. They
believed the remaining 68g were unlikely to be still in Germany.
The agent also claimed former members of the east German Stasi state
security service had set up a smuggling operation supplied from small
Russian boats plying Germany's Baltic coast.
In Moscow, the German embassy said its overriding concern was simply to find
the source of the nuclear material. If the plutonium found at Munich did
originate from Russia, as German investigators believe, then the German
government would help tighten international controls. If not, it could
redirect its investigations elsewhere.
Scientists believe it should be possible to trace the origin of the
plutonium-239 by studying its isotopic concentrations which leave a
distinctive 'fingerprint'. There are thought to be only three plants in
Russia capable of producing plutonium-239 in Chelyabinsk, Tomsk and
Krasnoyarsk.

Serbs fired at Bosnian government forces with an anti-aircraft gun
supposedly under United Nations control in a depot near Sarajevo, a UN
military spokesman said yesterday. The incident was provoked by a machine
gun barrage into the Bare weapons-storage point from Bosnian army positions
not far away and was the latest in a series that have eroded the integrity
of a 12-mile UN security zone around the Bosnian capital. Moslem-led
government troops targeted the Bare site on Monday evening, the spokesman
said, and Bosnian Serb troops staying in a house on the unfenced rural site
ran out, grabbed a 40mm anti-aircraft gun supervised by French peacekeepers
and fired back.
Meanwhile, Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic is resisting efforts to
deploy international monitors on Yugoslavia's borders with Bosnia. The
despatch of observers would be an important signal that Belgrade's
commitment to the embargo against the Bosnian Serbs is genuine. Mr Milosevic
imposed the embargo on August 4 after Bosnian Serb leaders rejected the
international peace plan for Serbs to give the Moslem-Croat federation a
third of the 70 per cent of Bosnia they currently control.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Top UK companies ignore advice on directors' contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly half of the UK's 100 largest listed companies have directors on
three-year rolling contracts, contrary to practices recommended by leading
investment institutions.
A Financial Times survey shows that 44 of the FT-SE 100 companies still have
these contracts, which can impose huge compensation costs when directors
resign or are dismissed.
They include Royal Bank of Scotland, Royal Insurance and Unilever, where 13
directors are on three-year rolling contracts. Concern about the costs of
such contracts has recently been echoed by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade
and industry secretary.
Reed Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch publishing group, disclosed this week that it
had agreed to make severance payments worth Pounds 2.02m to Mr Peter Davis,
former co-chairman, who resigned in June. Mr Davis was on a three-year
rolling contract.
Several companies have recently revealed that they have amended their
directors' contracts. British Gas is the latest company to disclose that it
has cut its contracts to two years.
BAT Industries, the tobacco and financial services group, has inserted a
clause in directors' contracts obliging any director leaving the company to
take all possible steps to find new employment 'commensurate with your
standing and expertise'. Failure to do so may reduce any pay-out.
Two months ago, PosTel, the Pounds 25bn pension fund, started voting against
the election and re-election of directors who have rolling service contracts
longer than two years.
Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive of PosTel, said yesterday: 'A
trickle of companies changing their contracts has turned to a steady flow.'
Using information available to it as shareholders in the UK's chief
companies, PosTel has drawn up a 'hit-list' of directors whom it is opposing
at AGMs. The Financial Times survey is based on the same information
available to shareholders about directors' contracts.
It found that there are nine FT-SE 100 companies which have recently moved
away from three-year rolling contracts or are doing so. These include the
drinks group Guinness and British Aerospace.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Fed lifts short-term rates to stem inflation pressure:
Discount rate up half a point; US bonds and stocks rally;Banks increase loan
costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US Federal Reserve yesterday lifted short-term interest rates for the
fifth time this year, adding half a percentage point in an effort to head
off inflation rises.
After a morning meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets
interest rate policy, the Fed announced that it was increasing the discount
rate which it charges on money lent to the banking system to 4 per cent from
3.5 per cent. The Fed is also raising the federal funds rate, which banks
charge each other on overnight balances, to 4.75 per cent from 4.25 per
cent.
Although an increase in rates had been widely expected, investors and
dealers were unsure whether the Fed would raise rates by a quarter of a
point or make the sharper adjustment that came yesterday.
On Wall Street, the news triggered a surge in bond prices and brought solid
gains to stocks. The markets had stumbled briefly in the minutes after the
Fed's announcement, but quickly picked up forward momentum during the
afternoon. Chase Manhattan raised its prime lending rate for its best
business customers to 7.75 per cent from 7.25 per cent in the wake of the
Fed move and other banks followed suit.
White House officials have repeatedly said that they see no signs of
inflation rises that would require a tightening of monetary policy, but add
that the Fed is independent. 'Given the strong gains in output and
employment so far this year, we need to be watchful for signs of developing
price pressures,' Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, and Ms Laura
Tyson, White House chief economist, said in a joint statement yesterday.
Democratic senators, however, were less sparing in their criticism. 'If
you're bored down there at the Fed, if a rosy economic outlook makes you
blue, get out of town, take a vacation, do any thing, but just don't raise
those interest rates,' Senator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona said before the
Fed move.
Fed officials note that they kept interest rates very low to try to boost
sluggish recovery in 1992 and 1993. 'In fact, real short term rates - that
is, adjusted for inflation - were around zero levels throughout last year,'
Mr Robert Parry, president of the San Francisco Fed, said last week.
Most recent economic data have suggested that the economy has slowed
considerably, and is growing at a much steadier pace than the 3.7 per cent
annualised rate of the second quarter.
However, July's employment statistics showed that job creation remained
strong, and the producer price index, published last Thursday, showed a 0.5
per cent bounce in wholesale prices last month. Fed officials say that
policy actions only show their effects about one-and-a-half to two years
later, and that they cannot be deterred by the apparently calm inflation
indices.
Some Fed economists argue that full employment is now reached when the
unemployment rate stands at around 6 per cent - very close to its current
level. Any further drop in unemployment, they say, could lead to shortages
of labour and be expected to provoke an acceleration in the inflation rate.
After the early pause, prices on longer-dated Treasury bonds climbed nearly
1 1/2 points on the rate rise, even though most analysts had anticipated the
Fed's course of action. Traders appeared reassured by the apparent resolve
of the Fed's chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan, to snuff out inflationary
pressures.
In the equity markets, the rate rise triggered a brief rally, but in minutes
a 20-point gain by the Dow Jones Industrial Average was converted into a
15-point loss. By the close, however, it was up 24.28 at 3,784.57. In Tokyo
today, stocks opened firmer.
The Bundesbank, which has a policy meeting tomorrow, is expected to let the
dust settle after the Fed move. Economists see scope for a German discount
rate cut, but believe the bank's 'steady hand' policy will prevail.

FT  17 AUG 94 / Rover plans investment of Pounds 1.5bn for new models

Rover Group, the leading UK carmaker and a subsidiary of BMW of Germany, is
planning to develop a range of smaller Land Rover four-wheel-drive vehicles
as part of a five-year new model investment plan.
The group is aiming to increase investment to around Pounds 1.5bn in the
next five years from the Pounds 1.2bn spent on model development in the
previous five years, said Mr John Towers, Rover chief executive.
'We are now openly committed to increasing our investment in the next cycle
of new models,' he said.
The group has spent around Pounds 300m to develop a luxury Range Rover to be
launched as a flagship for the group in the autumn, but it is understood
that Rover is seeking to expand its presence in the fast growing world
market for four-drive sports/utility vehicles, where it is already the
leading European manufacturer.
Land Rover, the group's specialist four-wheel-drive division, is planning to
launch a vehicle range, probably in 1997, positioned below its current Range
Rover and Discovery ranges and designed to appeal to younger car buyers.
Such a vehicle would compete with rivals such as the Suzuki Vitara and the
recently launched Toyota RAV4.
Mr Towers said that 'Land Rover should be part of creating opportunities for
people further down the range'.
'It is sensible and right to consider a business proposal to allow Land
Rover to spread its net and create an ability below Discovery prices to
attract people into the Land Rover fold.'
The Discovery itself, currently priced in the UK between Pounds 17,600 and
Pounds 26,800, has already transformed Land Rover's fortunes and has opened
up new market segments since it was launched in 1989 to complement the
luxury Range Rover and the utility Defender ranges. It accounted for 50 per
cent of Land Rover sales last year.
'We have a further opportunity to invite people to get involved below the
Discovery, but not far below,' said Mr Towers.
Total Land Rover sales jumped by 30 per cent last year to a record 73,527
from 56,450 in 1992, and Land Rover output has increased further by 35 per
cent to 43,600 in the first six months of this year, helped by the launch of
the Discovery in the US last spring.
Land Rover sales in the US in the first seven months of the year have more
than doubled to 5,640 from 2,572 in the corresponding period a year ago.
The Land Rover division was one of the main attractions for BMW, the German
executive and luxury carmaker, which paid Pounds 800m to acquire the Rover
group early this year.
