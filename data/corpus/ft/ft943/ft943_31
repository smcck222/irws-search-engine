FT  03 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Net asset value drops 17% at TR Pacific
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Net asset value per share of TR Pacific Investment Trust dropped 17 per cent
from 121.2p to 100.4p during the six months to June 30, but compared with
70.85p at end-June 1993.
Net revenue fell 27 per cent to Pounds 349,000, against Pounds 480,000,
despite gross revenue higher by 12 per cent at Pounds 1.44m.
However, this was not sufficient to offset higher management fees and
borrowing costs.
The trust raised its borrowing facility from Dollars 15m to Dollars 25m
(Pounds 16.1m).
Earnings per share were 0.26p (0.358p).

FT  03 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Increased car sales lift Cowie
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cowie Group, the car leasing and motor trading company, yesterday announced
a 32 per cent increase in half-year profits following a sharp rise in car
sales and fall in interest costs.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 15.5m to Pounds 20.5m as the group
exploited new leasing markets and sold almost 28,000 new cars in the six
months to June 30, an increase of 23 per cent.
The figures were also flattered by reduced interest payments of Pounds 10.9m
(Pounds 13.2m).
Group turnover jumped 25 per cent to Pounds 492m and Mr Gordon Hodgson,
chief executive, expressed 'cautious optimism' about future prospects.
He said all four core divisions had benefited from the three-prong strategy
of organic growth, acquisition and increased efficiency.
The performance was underpinned by the group's finance division, dominated
by Cowie Interleasing, where new fleet customers and improvements in the
renewal business contributed to profits of Pounds 13.6m (Pounds 10.7m).
Although divisional turnover fell to Pounds 113m (Pounds 117.6m), Mr Hodgson
said profit margins had improved on ex-contract hire vehicles and predicted
additional benefits from the acquisition in March of Fleet Motor Management,
Commercial Union's former leasing business.
In the motor division, profits rose to Pounds 5.4m (Pounds 3.65m) on
turnover of Pounds 355m (Pounds 249.4m) as the group enjoyed growing sales
of both new and used cars at its 42 outlets, including an initial six-month
contribution from Keep Trust, the dealership chain acquired for Pounds 39.5m
last year.
'The figures were encouraging given the challenging trading conditions and
pressure on margins,' said Mr Iain Jane, the division's managing director.
Increased demand from bus operators, meanwhile, helped Hughes DAF - the bus
and coach distribution business - report healthier profits of Pounds 1.5m
(Pounds 1m); while Grey-Green, the London bus and coach operator, saw a
modest rise to Pounds 863,000 (Pounds 781,000).
Earnings per share rose to 10.5p (8p), and the interim dividend is lifted to
2.725p (2.35p).
COMMENT
Cowie has plenty of power under the bonnet. It boasts well-run dealerships,
some blue chip fleet customers and has a good chance of forming a leading
bus company following the privatisation of London Transport. Yet the market
had hoped for more acceleration and the shares were left trailing 12p
yesterday at 256p. This was a little unfair. The results exceeded
expectations, just, and the group is set to prosper from the August car
boom. Noting Mr Hodgson's cautious approach, analysts left their full-year
profit forecasts largely unchanged at Pounds 43.5m. But for those
anticipating a rush to the showrooms in the second half, the shares look
under-valued on a forward multiple of 11.

FT  03 AUG 94 / US funeral group lifts bid for Great Southern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Service Corporation International, the world's largest funeral company,
yesterday increased its bid for Great Southern Group from 600p to 680p, and
purchased a further 16.5 per cent of the UK funeral company's shares.
Great Southern urged shareholders to take no action. After buying 1.96m
ordinary shares and 3.87m convertible shares yesterday, SCI controls 27 per
cent of Great Southern's fully-diluted share capital.
The outcome of this battle between contrasting companies still hangs on the
decision of the Field family, which has been in the burial business since
1690. JD Field owns 56 per cent of Great Southern's shares, and although 70
per cent of the private company is owned by trusts linked to the Field
family, the family owns enough shares directly to block any acceptance by
trustees.
SCI has been perplexed by the Field family's unwillingness to negotiate
directly in what is now a Pounds 99.1m takeover bid. Mr Bill Heiligbrodt,
SCI president, said: 'There is a cash bid for their company, and these
directors have upped and gone to Cowes. It is unbelievable.'
It is understood that an earlier meeting with the advisers of Great Southern
collapsed after SCI was told it could only negotiate if the bid price 'did
not begin with a six'. The latest offer represents a 43 per cent premium to
the Great Southern share price before the announcement of the initial offer,
and a historic price-earnings ratio of 24.2.
SCI claims the p/e is higher, questioning the accounting policy of Chosen
Heritage, Great Southern's pre-paid funeral business. SCI only books profits
on completed funerals. 'I would not feel right about taking that money out,
while the people were still walking,' said Mr Heiligbrodt.
SCI's offer closes on August 20.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Smurfit to double European operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Jefferson Smurfit, the Irish paper and packaging group, is more than
doubling the size of its European operations in a FFr5.63bn (Pounds 670m)
deal to buy the paper and packaging business of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain,
the French glass and building materials group.
Smurfit is buying Cellulose du Pin, which has operations in France, Italy,
Spain and Belgium, and produces recycled paper, corrugated boxes, coated
woodfree paper and paper sacks.
The purchase will propel Smurfit to the number one position in the European
corrugated industry with 10 per cent of the waste-based paper market. The
group's enlarged European operations will have sales of Pounds 1.4bn.
Smurfit is taking on debt of up to FFr2.9bn as part of the consideration.
The balance of the FFr2.73bn will be paid to Saint-Gobain, half on
completion and the rest in two annual tranches.
Mr Howard Kilroy, Smurfit president, said the company was examining ways of
financing the acquisition. Initially, it would be funded through debt and
internal resources which could leave the group up to 100 per cent geared.
Mr Michael Smurfit, chairman, said the deal would give his company a 'major
position in France, where until now we have had only modest representation'.
Smurfit is expected to have up to 20 per cent of the French corrugated
market.
The deal is subject to approval from the European Commission.
Saint-Gobain said last night the sale of Cellulose du Pin reflected the fact
that, despite considerable investment, the group had not reached the
leadership position in Europe that Saint-Gobain had achieved in glass and
building materials.
Saint-Gobain said Cellulose du Pin, which last year lost FFr1.1bn on
turnover of FFr8bn, would be better off with a world-scale paper operation
like Smurfit.
Saint-Gobain said it was too early to say how it would use the FFr900m
capital gain from the sale.
Cellulose du Pin employs 8,000 people in France, Spain, Italy and Belgium
and makes 1.3m tonnes of paper and 750,000 tonnes of packaging material a
year.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Airline cracks in the French financial facade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I can write about France in the confident expectation that the French all
went on their vacances last weekend and won't be reading this. I have
memories of upsetting the Italians last autumn when I unkindly suggested
that the pioneering Italian 30-year bond, then being launched into the heady
climax of the global bull market in bonds, might not prove a very good
investment. Indeed, the yield on the bonds has gone up from under 10 to 11
1/2 per cent.
As the Italians have tottered from one crisis to another the French have
staged an impressive financial revival. But is it sustainable? The
extraordinary bail-out of Air France last week through the injection of
FFr20bn (Pounds 2.4bn) of government money demonstrated just how far the
French still are from being comfortable European partners with some notion
of what a level playing field might be.
Nevertheless, in the past 10 years the French have rebuilt their financial
reputation by tenaciously pursuing a relationship with Germany at the heart
of the EU. The franc stayed glued to the D-Mark when sterling and the lira
were blown away. It is still just within the old 2 1/4 per cent bands
against the D-Mark.
But the cost has been a rise in unemployment to nearly 13 per cent (against
9 per cent in Germany) and a serious deterioration in the country's
finances. The socialist government last year crashed to electoral disaster.
The unemployment issue is bound to figure much more prominently in next
year's presidential election and is likely to increase political risks in
the French bond market.
Although the fiscal deficit of 6 per cent is not alarming by current
European standards, it is also necessary to take into account (as with
Italy) the unfunded liabilities of the bankrupt repartition pension schemes.
The French authorities are heavily dependent upon foreign finance:
foreigners own nearly 40 per cent of French government bonds. That may
explain why a few weeks ago I was asked to take part in a strange telephone
opinion poll commissioned by the French government. International opinion
leaders (flattery will get you anywhere) were being asked to give their
views on France's financial reputation.
The dominance of dirigisme was suspect, I said. But you had to admire the
ability of the French to cash in on agriculture, arms and subsidised
aviation.
The results of the survey might be published, I was told, if they were
favourable. I never heard any more. But I pondered on some of the more silly
questions, such as, which was the animal that most struck me as typically
French in character?
I chose a racehorse, on the grounds that it was stylish but could not always
beat long odds.
The 10-year French bond yield got down to parity with its bund equivalent
last year, but this year the differential has widened again to about 45
basis points. Inflation is low. But the budget deficit has increased
substantially and fiscal tightening will be required in September's budget.
The financial ratios are spiralling out of reach of the Maastricht limits,
and though temporary breaches may be solved through a Eurofudge it is hard
to see that France can stay credibly on a convergence path for much longer.
As for the subsidy issue, the point is not just that the Air France
injection will distort the international airline industry but also that the
French government will have to find the money. At the same time the
ambitious privatisation programme could be disrupted by growing political
uncertainty.
As the German economic powerhouse begins to revive on a growing diet of
exports, France will have to test its internal economic consensus to the
limit.
Back in London, I have been taken to task by the Bank of England for
suggesting last week that the Bank had not taken advantage of last year's
bull market to issue its own Italian-style long bond.
Indeed, I had overlooked the issue on January 26 of a 16-year gilt yielding
6.4 per cent. The bond now returns 8.4 per cent so the Bank did well for
British taxpayers, but perhaps a 30-year gilt would have exploited the
conditions even better. The Italians win on points.

FT  03 AUG 94 / BP's 40% rise beats expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Petroleum yesterday exceeded analysts' expectations with
second-quarter profits of Pounds 335m, more than 40 per cent up on the same
period last year in spite of lower oil prices.
The company's first-half profits - on a relacement cost basis - rose from
Pounds 471m to Pounds 640m. Its shares closed 7p higher at 418 1/2 p.
The strong second quarter performance was attributed to increased
productivity, lower costs and volume growth. It was achieved against a
background of oil prices Dollars 3 a barrel lower than the same period last
year and intense competition in downstream markets, according to Mr David
Simon, chief executive.
He said BP was achieving its goals set two years ago. These were to: reduce
debt by Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) a year; increase replacement cost profits
to Dollars 2bn a year; and keep annual capital spending below Dollars 5bn.
Mr Steve Ahearne, finance director, said disposals were on course to raise
Pounds 1bn-Pounds 1.5bn this year. Positive underlying cashflow allowed BP
to repay Dollars 336m in debt in the second quarter and total debt had
fallen to Dollars 11.4bn from a peak in 1992 of more than Dollars 16bn.
Gearing was 70 per cent.
Executives were optimistic that all BP's market segments would enjoy some
improvement in the second half. Exploration and production profits rose 27
per cent from the previous quarter to Pounds 479m, boosted by increased oil
and gas output, stronger oil prices and cost savings.
Refining and marketing margins suffered, however, as crude prices rose.
Profits of Pounds 133m were well down on Pounds 228m in the first quarter
and Pounds 197m last year.
Economic recovery in the US and Europe helped to lift chemicals earnings to
Pounds 45m, from a Pounds 23m loss. Although executives described the
cyclical upturn in chemicals as 'hesitant', Mr Simon said: 'We are more
sanguine about the spreading economic recovery.'
Analysts said the results also suggested that BP's medium-term position was
improving. Mr Simon said the company would continue to focus on efficiency
and cost-cutting measures. Other factors, such as higher crude prices,
rising volumes from new big fields and increased demand were likely to play
a greater part in underpinning profits.
The company reported a structural change in its tax position which should
result in its effective tax rate falling by as much as 10 percentage points
to the mid-to-high 30 per cent band.
Earnings per share rose to 6.1p, from 5.6p in the first quarter and 4.4p a
year ago. A dividend of 2.5p was announced, the same as the first quarter
but up from 2.1p a year ago.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Fighting talk as NatWest advances 83%: Response to price
cuts - Profits reach Pounds 767m / Interim dividend up 14%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Westminster Bank yesterday said it would fight to protect its share
of lending amid growing competition, and indicated that it would respond to
rivals' price cuts.
The pugnacious comments accompanied the disclosure of an 83 per cent rise in
interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 767m, against Pounds 419m, driven by a big
fall in provisions for bad and doubtful debts.
NatWest, the UK's second largest bank, responded to discontent over its 6
per cent increase in total dividend last year by raising the interim payout
14 per cent to 7.3p (6.4p). Lord Alexander, chairman, said this showed
'confidence in the future'. The shares gained 17p to 470p.
Slack demand led to customer loans and advances falling to Pounds 81.7bn
from Pounds 85.7bn in June 1993. Mr Derek Wanless, chief executive, said
there were signs of demand picking up, but the bank faced strong
competition.
'Parts of the UK market are very difficult. We have got a strong market
share and we do not intend to lose it,' he said. He indicated that NatWest
might respond to Abbey National's cut in authorised overdraft lending rates.
Bad debt provisions fell to Pounds 370m from Pounds 643m. Provisions in UK
branch banking more than halved to Pounds 216m, with those for medium-sized
companies falling 58 per cent and for small companies, 57 per cent.
But operating income was flat at Pounds 3.45bn, against Pounds 3.47bn. In
addition to pressure on branch earnings, profits at NatWest Markets, its
corporate and investment banking arm, fell to Pounds 201m, against Pounds
256m, in poorer trading conditions. Although it suffered from bond price
falls, this was partly offset by higher equity volume. Securities trading
income fell to Pounds 67m (Pounds 76m). Mr Wanless said the figure was quite
stable because it mostly traded on behalf of customers.
NatWest met its target of 17.5 per cent return on equity for the first time
since 1988, with an annualised return of 18.1 per cent. Mr Richard Goeltz,
chief financial officer, said all its arms earned 'close to an appropriate
rate of return'.
It achieved a 6 per cent tier 1 ratio of core capital - mostly equity and
retained earnings - to risk-weighted assets. Lord Alexander said the bank
now had 'robust capital ratios' which would allow it to grow. Expenses rose
slightly to Pounds 2.33bn (Pounds 2.24bn), and the ratio of cost to income
rose from 64.6 to 67.6 per cent.
Profits at NatWest Bancorp, the US retail bank, rose 30 per cent to Pounds
117m, while those of Lombard, the finance arm, rose 59 per cent to Pounds
111m. European operations lost Pounds 5m.
Net asset value per ordinary share rose to 338p (322p) and earnings per
share to 30p, against 12p.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Sky's the limit as MacKenzie leaves News Corp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kelvin MacKenzie, who dominated The Sun for 13 years, has run out of Sky
after less than seven months.
The UK's most notorious and successful tabloid newspaper editor -
surprisingly appointed managing director of British Sky Broadcasting in
January without any television experience - abruptly left the satellite
broadcaster last night.
Mr MacKenzie's Sun earned a unique place in the history of British
journalism with headlines such as 'Gotcha' and 'Stick It Up Your Junta'
during the Falklands war; 'Freddie Starr Ate My Hamster' and 'Up yours,
Delors'.
Last night's parting comments left, like the Sun's Page 3, little to the
imagination. The slightest glance between the lines suggested that Mr
MacKenzie's short television career had not been a success.
In what amounted to a corporate goodbye, Mr Rupert Murdoch was already
looking backwards at Mr MacKenzie's achievements as he praised his brilliant
editorship of The Sun. 'His hard work and determination will long be
remembered. I count him as a friend and wish him every success,' Mr Murdoch
said.
It is unlikely that Mr MacKenzie could have been hired for such a senior
position without the explicit approval of Mr Murdoch or that he could be now
leaving News Corporation without Mr Murdoch's involvement and agreement.
Mr MacKenzie said he had worked for News Corporation for 20 years and that
his leaving did not 'cast any shadow over my very fond memories of the
company and its personalities'. Mr MacKenzie blamed a personality clash for
his resignation.
The biggest personality at BSkyB to clash with is Mr Sam Chisholm, chief
executive, who handled the merger with BSB and is widely credited with
having turned around the company's fortunes.
Not many people have emerged on top from a personality clash with Mr
Chisholm, whose vocabulary is as ripe as any tabloid editor's. At the time
of his appointment Mr Chisholm spoke of Mr MacKenzie as 'highly creative'.
Mr MacKenzie was probably appointed managing director of BSkyB, a venture in
which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake, partly as a reward
for his performance at The Sun and partly in the hope that his populist
touch would translate into television.
There was speculation last night that Mr MacKenzie might be on his way back
to writing tabloid headlines - with the Daily Express, where his brother
Craig is an executive.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Electronics groups agree on standard optical disc format
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Leading electronics companies in the US, Europe and Japan have agreed to
adopt a single standard for next generation magneto-optical discs which are
used to record sound and video information.
The move could significantly boost the market for the discs, likely to be
the dominant recording medium for digital information in the multimedia age.
Fujitsu, the Japanese electronics company, and IBM of the US have submitted
a letter to the International Standards Organisation, which represents 24
companies in the industry, indicating agreement on a standard for advanced
MO discs. The companies include Japan's Sony, Sharp and Olympus, Philips of
the Netherlands and Hewlett Packard and 3M of the US.
MO discs are 3 1/2 -inch discs, resembling a CD encased in a floppy disc.
They record information stored in a computer or other equipment, and are
removable. They can contain several hundred times more information than the
most advanced floppy discs. An example of an MO disc system currently in use
is Sony's MiniDisc system, which is a recordable miniature compact disc
system.
Standardising MO discs and disc drives would reduce prices and broaden the
use of the discs, which are likely to replace floppy discs as the main
removable recording medium for digital sound, data and video.
The adoption of a single standard reflects a trend within the electronics
industry to avoid costly and bruising battles over competing standards.
However, Matsushita, the Japanese electronics company, a leading maker of MO
discs, has not backed the standard, focusing instead on recording technology
primarily for consumer electronics products in competition with video tapes.
The technology Matsushita is developing - phase change technology - is not
expected to compete with the new MO discstandard as it does not handle the
quickly changing data requirements of computers. Also, Matsushita buys a
significant amount of its MO disc drives from Fujitsu and could adopt the
new standard at any time.
Since MO discs can also record sound and video as well as data they are
expected to play a leading role in multimedia services, such as
video-on-demand or interactive television. But a disc drive costs about
Dollars 800 (Pounds 520) while a current generation 230-megabyte disc is
priced at about Dollars 50.
The manufacturers hope that by standardising the next generation discs,
which will be capable of recording 600MB of information, or roughly
equivalent to a CD-Rom, they can cut prices.
The market for MO disc drives is dominated by Japanese companies. Fujitsu
has a 30.7 per cent market share for the 128MB generation, says the IDC, the
high technology consultancy. Last year, 240,000 disc drives were sold but
the IDC estimates sales may rise to 2m units by 1997.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Berlusconi tries to repair damage of Fininvest row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi last night sought to restore his credibility with a
public address aimed at solving the controversial issue of his conflicting
interest as Italian prime minister and owner of the Fininvest media empire.
As part of a parliamentary debate called by the opposition, Mr Berlusconi
offered to make even more watertight his separation from Fininvest, Italy's
second-largest private group which controls 80 per cent of commercial
television. He said he was prepared to 'accept any technical solution' that
was suggested by parliament.
This was a significant softening of the position he outlined only last
Friday. But in a defensive speech, occasionally interrupted by opposition
jeering, he appeared willing to trade parliament's agreement on this issue
in return for a solid mandate to continue governing.
Speaking for the opposition, Mr Massimo D'Alema, leader of the former
communist Party of the Democratic Left, insisted the conflict of interest
was so great that Mr Berlusconi had to approve a break-up of his Fininvest
television interests. He said Mr Berlusconi was incapable of addressing the
issue as a statesman because he was too involved in protecting his business
activities from investigating magistrates.
The toughest speech in the debate came from Mr Berlusconi's partner in
government, Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the populist Northern League, who
attacked the prime minister for failing to settle the conflict of interest
before taking office.
Mr Bossi said the league would present proposals within the next few days.
In a first stage, Mr Berlusconi would have to be separated clearly from the
management of Fininvest. Second, Fininvest interests must be placed in a
closed fund. This suggests the league will favour sale of his assets, if not
creation of a special foundation.
Mr Bossi showed he intended to use the league's role in formulating
legislation as a weapon to continue humiliating Mr Berlusconi - although he
pledged not to bring down the government.
The debate marked the second time in five days that Mr Berlusconi has had to
confront problems created by his ownership of Fininvest. Last Friday, he
proposed the creation of a five-member commission to monitor any conflict of
interest that might arise, plus an administrator to represent his interests
as Fininvest's dormant proprietor.
This followed opposition concern over the way Mr Berlusconi had become
dragged into a conflict between the executive and the judiciary over
investigations by Milan anti-corruption magistrates into Fininvest.
Last Friday, Mr Berlusconi's younger brother, Paolo, handed himself in to
Milan magistrates. He later admitted to paying L330m (Pounds 135,000) in
bribes to members of the Guardia di Finanza, the financial police, over the
inspections of three Fininvest companies. His lawyer said the payments had
been made under duress.

FT  03 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: European equities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
London was not the only equity market in holiday mood yesterday. But the
strength of European bourses is not a one-day wonder. While relatively thin
trading volumes played a part, Frankfurt had already risen by 5 per cent and
Paris by more than 10 per cent from troughs at the end of June. Optimism
about the pace of economic recovery - confirmed by yesterday's strong June
industrial output figures for western Germany - is the underlying cause.
Since most European markets are still below the levels reached early in the
year and earnings forecasts are higher, there could be further gains to
come. The speed of recovery means that cyclical European companies now look
likely to report peak earnings in 1996/97, a full year earlier than
anticipated. Sectors valued by investors on multiples of peak earnings -
such as chemicals - have shown particularly strong gains as a result.
Even so, investors will be looking to half-year results statements for
reassurance. Euphoria should also be tempered by the knowledge that upsets
in bond or currency markets could again spill over into equities. While US
interest rate rises should be less troublesome from now on, problems could
arise elsewhere. If bourses continue higher and the dollar starts to
strengthen, for example, US fund managers could be tempted to take profits
on European shares.

FT  03 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: BP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies only announce targets they know they can meet, claim those who
downplay the scale of BP's achievement over the past two years. At the time
though, there were many who doubted the targets could be hit at all, let
alone a year early. Yesterday Mr David Simon, chief executive, declared the
recovery programme virtually complete as the company announced
second-quarter figures well ahead of City expectations.
The exploration and production numbers were particularly impressive with
second-quarter profits matching those a year earlier in spite of a Dollars 3
a barrel fall in the oil price. The 27 per cent increase over the previous
quarter, on the back of a Dollars 1.50 price rise to Dollars 15.41, shows
what might be in store if the Nigerian strike escalates.
Yet the shares rose only in line with the market. The sharp downturn in US
refining was certainly unsettling as were cautious comments about margin
recovery in chemicals, though shares in Shell, which is more dependent on
downstream business, did not flinch. A more fundamental question now is
quite where BP goes from here. With healthy cash flow and debt about to fall
to Dollars 10bn, the company can alter the balance between debt-reduction,
investment and dividends. It says it is in no hurry to crank up investment
and can accommodate current plans, including expansion in central Europe,
Indonesia and China, within a Dollars 4bn a year budget. That leaves ample
scope to rebuild the dividend, while the shares still look attractive in
terms of earnings. Those who question BP's ability to find another Dollars
1bn of profit should remember what happened to the doubters last time.

FT  03 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: National Westminster
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are two ways of looking at National Westminster's 14 per cent dividend
increase. One is that it is an attempt to offset last year's relative
stinginess, which was badly received by the market. The other that it is a
genuine signal of confidence in improving profits. Both have a ring of
plausibility. Although the bank's trading surplus fell 9 per cent during the
first half, provisions are lower than the market expected and there are some
outstanding bright spots, notably in the Lombard finance division and in the
US where loan demand is growing and margins are widening. Whether this is
sufficient evidence that the bank has really turned the corner is another
matter.
Although there is room for provisions to fall further, there must be
questions over the pace. The 42 per cent drop in the first half - which
happily helped finance the dividend rise and leaves tier one capital at
exactly 6 per cent - is much larger than the fall in loans on which interest
is not being accrued. As for the weak trading surplus, it is too easy simply
to blame this on weak UK loan demand which is affecting all banks.
Yesterday's figures leave room for doubt about NatWest's grip on costs.
This is not only true of UK retail banking where trading profits fell by 5
per cent and the bank itself admits that further cost cutting is needed.
Despite a commendable increase in dealing profits, the trading surplus at
NatWest Markets actually fell by 22 per cent in the first half. Presumably
NatWest is happy to let costs rise as the business grows. But it urgently
needs to show that its investment can earn a decent return.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The City has been spared a rate rise this week, but the Bank of England's
inflation report leaves little doubt that it is looking for one in the not
too distant future. The longer term aim is to have underlying inflation in
the lower half of its target range by the end of the current parliament.
Since changes in monetary policy take about two years to have the desired
impact, action needs to be taken soon if that aim is to be achieved. The
difficulty lies in choosing the moment, however. If it acts too soon and the
recovery falters, the Bank will suffer as much damage to its credibility as
it would by dithering.
The new report may have made its task harder. Though output is growing
faster than the Bank assumed in May, its expectations of inflation have been
trimmed back with a neat downward tick in 1996 as the impact of higher VAT
on fuel drops out of the equation. But if the outlook really is that benign,
it is hard to see how the Bank will justify rate rises to a reluctant
government.
Yesterday financial markets seemed inclined to believe its projections. Both
gilts and equities are cheap if they are right. Gilts were factoring in
excessive inflationary expectations, while equities could sustain higher
ratings if price rises are contained. But the excitement may be premature.
The Bank appears to be waiting for clear signs of short-run inflationary
pressures to push through a rate rise. By the time these appear it may be
too late to achieve its medium-term objective.

So why does the international trading group Marc Rich want us to call it
Glencore from now on? Is this the rump of two partners' names fused
together, or perhaps the location of a Speyside whisky distillery?
No, in the dreary fashion of our times it turns out to be yet another
acronym - standing for global energy, commodities and resources.
Still, it is a lot better than most of the gibberish titles, such as Zeneca,
Varity, Navistar and Exxon, that companies shell out hundreds of thousands
of pounds to have invented for them.
A name change has been mooted since Marc Rich himself stepped down from the
chair last December and reduced his majority stake to a 25 per cent holding.
He plans to dispose of that too before very long.
Rich has been wanted in the US on tax evasion, fraud and racketeering
charges for more than a decade.
So it is perhaps understandable that the company wants to dispense with a
handle almost every public reference to which is prefaced by that
embarrassing little word - 'fugitive'.

Talking of maverick yachtsmen, Ted Turner's Goodwill Games in St Petersburg
still seem to be having teething troubles.
Last week the swimmers were delayed because the water in the swimming pool
had turned the wrong colour and yesterday the short-track speed-skating
competition ran into problems because the ice was not ready.
Worse still, Turner Broadcasting, which has spent upwards of Dollars 100m on
the event, looks like being out of pocket because the US TV ratings have
been below expectations.
However, it takes much more than this to upset Turner who is already
starting to concentrate on the 1996 Olympics which are coming to his home
town of Atlanta. Indeed, there is even talk that Turner may be in the
running to be one of the two US members of the International Olympic
Committee.
It is over two and a half years since Robert Helmick, the former president
of the US Olympic Committee was forced to stand down and a decision on a
replacement is expected by
early September.
While some members of the US sporting establishment would run a mile before
allowing Turner on board, sporting cognoscenti have noted that Harvey
Schiller, the executive director of the US Olympic committee has announced
that he will be joining Turner's sports broadcasting arm in the autumn.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Observer: De Savary tries again
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While Britain's grander yachties graced the lawns of the Royal Yacht
Squadron for Cowes Week, a prominent but decidely unclubbable UK yachtsman
has been trying to catch their attention from across the Atlantic.
America's Cup challengers are normally invited to join the Squadron, but
Peter de Savary's multi-million endeavours at the race have cut no ice with
the nobs at Cowes Castle, who heartily dislike almost everything about the
entrepreneur. Now he has decided to challenge them at sea.
The occasion presents itself courtesy of the New York Yacht Club, which, as
part of its 150th birthday celebrations, is unveiling another international
sailing trophy. The first race will be held off Newport, Rhode Island, in
1996 with a new class of 60ft yachts, crewed strictly by amateurs.
After almost two years of discussions, the NYYC had secured the
participation of the Royal Yacht Squadron. But flag officers were startled
earlier this week when De Savary, on holiday afloat his yacht Carabana,
inquired whether another British challenge would be acceptable. He got the
green light.
Clearly not unduly deflated by the problems of part of his business empire
earlier this year, De Savary has promised to return to the UK and drum up
the Dollars 1.5m that he will need.
But he can assemble the best amateur team in the world and beat everyone on
the high seas. Membership of the RYS - or of the NYYC - never had anything
to do with sporting ability.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Leading Article: The Bank looks up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England's Quarterly Inflation Report was introduced to give
British monetary policy greater 'openness and accountability'. Judging by
the City's recent confusions, many are still trying to work out what that
entails. But as far as the Bank is concerned, the latest answer is that
interest rates will have to rise in the months ahead if the government's
inflation target is to be met. Bank-watchers should not be surprised that it
declines to say when.
Once again, the Bank has been caught out by the slow pace of price increases
since its last report was published three months ago. Instead of rising
slightly in the second quarter of 1994, as predicted, the government's
target measure of inflation remained broadly stable. However, as the Bank
never tires of pointing out, the more relevant prediction is that for two
years hence, since that is roughly how long it takes for interest rate
changes to take effect. As in May, the report predicts that if interest
rates remain unchanged, inflation will then be 3 - 3 1/2 per cent, above the
government's 1 - 2 1/2 per cent target range for the end of the current
parliament.
Before long, therefore, interest rates will have to rise. As the Bank
observes, inflationary pressures could be well developed even while the
actual inflation rate continued to fall. 'It is possible', it somewhat coyly
remarks, 'though not yet certain, that the UK is entering this phase.' Such
turning points are notoriously hard to judge, but the Bank yesterday doubled
the number of inflation 'risks' which it thinks worth worrying about.
Output growth
In addition to the three dangers identified in May - excessive money growth,
inflation expectations, and labour cost increases - movements in commodity
prices and company profit margins may also feed into the inflation rate in
the coming months. Finally, there is a chance that the current growth rate
of output is taking the British economy closer to its current potential
level than was previously estimated.
Cynics might suggest that the unexpectedly good behaviour of the variables
highlighted in May has left the Bank searching for other reasons to
recommend a rate increase before the end of the year. Indeed, only one, the
growth of narrow money, is currently a cause for concern.
This grew at an annual rate of 6.5 per cent in July. Although the rate of
increase has subsided somewhat in recent months, it still lies well above
the government's 0-4 per cent monitoring range. Cash balances may still be
adjusting to lower interest rates, though the Bank may not find this
explanation convincing for very much longer.
Still, growth of the broader measure of the money supply, M4, was a subdued
5.2 per cent for the six months to June, well within its 3-9 per cent
monitoring range. And, as the report admits, neither expectations of
inflation nor the underlying growth of average earnings have deteriorated
since May.
Interest rates
Underlying growth in average earnings has stabilised in recent months at 3
3/4 per cent. Expectations of inflation, as measured by survey data and bond
market expectations, are much the same as they were three months ago, albeit
higher than the government would like. Is the speculation that interest
rates will rise overdone?
In order to make the alternative judgment - that interest rates should not
be raised over the next few months - one has to believe one of two things.
Either price pressures entering the fifth year of a recovery will be lower
than currently predicted, or the government should not act to deliver on its
target.
Clearly, neither is a judgment the Bank is prepared to make. Thanks to
innovations such as the Quarterly Inflation Report, the Bank's reputation
and influence has grown during this recovery, almost as steadily as the
economy itself. But with monetary policy still ultimately determined by the
chancellor, it will take more than two years of non-inflationary growth for
the new regime to establish its credibility. A pre-emptive rate rise in the
coming months, before higher inflation has had a chance to get established,
offers the best strategy for sustaining both.

FT  03 AUG 94 / A pyramid of many parts: Kevin Done examines restructuring
in the automotive components industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The competitive screw has tightened remorselessly on the world's automotive
components suppliers, as leading car and truck makers have sought to shore
up their sagging profitability during recession.
With bought-in components accounting for well over 50 per cent of the costs
of a car, the vehicle assemblers seek to squeeze their suppliers first, when
the going gets tough.
The fierce restructuring and fluctuating fortunes of the car and truck
makers themselves have been immediately apparent in several ways: the record
losses - and now the record profits - of the big three US carmakers; the
corporate revolutions at General Motors and Volkswagen; the record losses at
Nissan, Fiat and VW; the resurgence of Chrysler; the break-up of the
Renault/Volvo alliance; the financial collapse of Daf.
Down in the dense undergrowth of the automotive components supply industry,
however, the bloodletting is no less intense. Profound changes are taking
place in the global motor industry, and much of the activity concerns the
crucial relationship between the vehicle maker and its suppliers.
The demands of the vehicle makers are forcing the components industry to
restructure: New alliances are being thrown up. Valeo of France and Siemens
of Germany announced last week that they are studying a merger of their
automotive air conditioning and heater systems businesses into a
FFr4bn-a-year joint venture (see accompanying article).
The industry is consolidating as suppliers seek economies of scale to meet
the increasing and costly demands from the vehicle makers for enhanced
research and development. Allied Signal of the US, one of the leading
automotive braking systems suppliers, has entered into a worldwide truck
brake joint venture with Knorr-Bremse of Germany. With annual sales of
Dollars 650m and a workforce of 4,600 the venture is designed to cope with
the rising R&amp;D costs stemming from the introduction of electronic systems.
Opportunities for components producers are emerging as cost pressures force
vehicle makers to go outside for operations previously conducted in-house.
ITT, the US conglomerate, has spent Dollars 400m to buy 80 per cent of a
General Motors automotive components business, making electric motors and
wiper systems with an annual turnover of Dollars 760m. GM is pruning its
Automotive Components Group as part of the wrenching effort to restore its
North American vehicle assembly operations to profit.
As the industry undergoes transformation, the front-rank automotive
components suppliers are having to establish a global presence to meet the
demands of vehicle makers for global sourcing. Components producers are also
having to develop into suppliers of systems rather than simply of
components, as the vehicle makers concentrate more on their own core
activities of new product development - overall programme management rather
than the design and development of vehicle components - and final vehicle
assembly.
According to Mr Karl Ludvigsen, chairman of Ludvigsen Associates, the
UK-based automotive analysts: 'Carmakers want the supplier to participate
more in development, to be a more active partner in innovation and to carry
out testing and validation so thoroughly that the carmaker no longer needs
to check incoming components and sub-assemblies before bolting them into an
automobile.'
The structure emerging throughout the world automotive components sector
reflects more closely the pyramid organisation of the Japanese industry with
tiers of suppliers.
The players in the first tier are growing in size and technological
capability, as they assume new responsibilities. But at the same time the
category is becoming smaller, as the vehicle makers try to rationalise their
supply bases and reduce radically the number of suppliers with which they
have to deal.
'These new requirements will result in a shake-out that will leave fewer
than 300 truly global tier-one suppliers by the year 2000,' says Mr Ralph
Reins, president of AlliedSignal Automotive. 'Those that cannot meet the
demands of global sourcing, programme management and systems packaging will
either drop further down the supply chain or, like old soldiers, simply fade
away.'
Individual carmakers have taken drastic action to cut the number of their
direct suppliers from about 1,250 on average in 1988 to 900 at present,
according to a report produced by the Boston Consulting Group for the
European Commission. The number is expected to drop again to about 400 by
1997. Companies operating as second- or third-tier suppliers may fall by up
to a third, warns the study.
In Europe, Ford is cutting its suppliers from 1,200 in the late 1980s to
about 500 by 1996. As it moves to the use of single rather than multiple
sourcing for a given part or system, it is 'signing long-term contracts with
fewer suppliers for large volumes of components', according to Mr Eckhard
Jokisch, vice-president of supply.
'The European motor industry still has more suppliers than it really needs,'
he says. 'A lot have already fallen by the wayside . . . Changing our
philosophy from buying nationally to buying globally has already led to a
reduction in numbers. Our strategy of purchasing higher levels of
sub-assemblies will reduce the number of suppliers even further.'
Ford had more than 700 suppliers - all in North America - for its US-built
Ford Tempo/Mercury Topaz large family car range. Its successor, the Ford
Contour/Mercury Mystique, which has just entered production in the US has
only 227 suppliers, drawn from around the world.
The reduction in supplier numbers is spreading right down the chain, as the
first-tier components producers behave as rigorously as the vehicle makers.
AlliedSignal Automotive has cut the number of its suppliers from 2,400 at
the beginning of the 1990s to 1,000 and this will be reduced further to 900.
Valeo of France had 3,500 suppliers in Europe in mid-1991. This number has
been cut to 1,800 and the aim is to reach about 1,000 by the end of 1995.
The rationalisation of the industry is having alarming consequences for
jobs. The Boston Consulting Group report warned that employment in
automotive components production in the European Union could decline by at
least 40 per cent from 1992 to the end of the decade. More than 400,000 jobs
were likely to be shed, it said, as European components makers sought to
close the productivity gap with the Japanese industry.
Bosch of Germany, the leading European automotive components supplier, alone
cut 13,200 jobs last year (from all areas of operations including consumer
goods and communications technology) to reduce its group workforce to
156,600. Another 4,100 jobs are being eliminated this year. Bosch has been a
notable victim of the recession, incurring an operating loss of more than
DM500m last year, the first substantial loss in the postwar period.
The fortunes of many in the industry have begun to improve this year,
however. Some groups, such as Valeo and T&amp;N of the UK, have already improved
profitability in the past two years, and in the US leading automotive
components makers such as Allied Signal and TRW have seen record profits in
the second quarter.
While the industry restructures it is clear that the most agile first-tier
suppliers, capable of operating at the leading edge of their particular
technologies, have golden opportunities for growth.
Many suppliers are expected to disappear in 'the greatest rationalisation
the sector has ever experienced', according to a recent report by the
Economist Intelligence Unit. The survivors, in contrast, will be 'larger and
fitter with a global base to their operations and comprehensive R&amp;D
facilities'.
As the adversarial relationships of old between the vehicle makers and their
suppliers are gradually reformed with a new emphasis on partnership and
transparency, negotiating power is increasingly moving in favour of the top
components makers. But for those unable to keep up with the pace of change,
the message is stark.
As Mr Reins puts it: 'The bottom line for suppliers today is crystal clear:
change or die.'

FT  03 AUG 94 / Reconditioned for growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Valeo, the French automotive components supplier, has come through the deep
recession in the European auto industry with flying colours. While leading
rivals such as Bosch of Germany and Italy's Magneti Marelli incurred heavy
losses last year, Valeo has maintained profits, writes Kevin Done.
Mr Noel Goutard, Valeo's ebullient chairman and chief executive, was one of
the first leaders in the automotive components industry to anticipate the
downturn and batten down the hatches in 1990. Now that the market is
improving, Valeo is going for growth while some rivals are still clearing
the wreckage of the recession.
'In 1994 we are in a new phase, and we anticipate strong growth,' says Mr
Goutard. 'We believe that by 1995-96 the American, European and Japanese
markets will be in a unique situation with all three converging on a path of
strong growth. Asia/Pacific will join as a fourth important region. There
will be four markets in high gear and we want to be ready.'
Valeo has become a standard bearer of the European automotive components
industry. Over the past decade it has provided a textbook example of how a
regional player can develop into a global supplier.
After three years of losses in the mid-1980s the group came under the
minority control of the Cerus group of Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the Italian
industrialist. Mr Goutard was recruited from Thomson, the French electronics
group, to turn round the ailing con-glomerate.
Initially, Valeo's non-automotive operations in construction materials,
mechanical engineering and defence were jettisoned. Valeo then set out to
transform itself from a company with markets largely limited to France,
Italy and Spain, into a European supplier and, eventually, into a global
components producer. Acquisitions took it into the UK - to serve the newly
arriving Japanese carmakers - and also into Germany and Sweden.
A similar route, together with joint ventures, has allowed it to expand its
presence into North and South America and Asia (notably into South Korea).
Of group sales last year of FFr20.2bn (Pounds 2.43bn) some 41 per cent was
derived from France, 36 per cent from the rest of Europe, 14 per cent from
North America (including Mexico) and 9 per cent from South America and Asia.
The group now has 68 production plants worldwide, of which 20 are outside
Europe. In an industry becoming ever more concentrated, it supplies
virtually all of the world's leading vehicle makers. But its main customers
are the two French producers PSA Peugeot Citroen and Renault, Chrysler of
the US, the Volkswagen group of Germany and Fiat of Italy.
Valeo has seized the opportunity - and risk - offered by Chrysler's
resurgence. The US carmaker has come from nowhere five years ago to become
its third most important customer, ahead of VW and Fiat.
The French group has focused operations in sectors where it can be number
one or two in Europe or the world: in automotive lighting, clutches, air
conditioning and heating, radiators, plus electrical, wiper and security
systems.
This structure served it well, but the acquisitions spree was halted by the
threat of recession, when it had to take tough measures to reduce debt
levels, cut back its workforce and increase productivity.
'We said a healthy balance sheet and a continuous improvement of our
operating margins, and not sales growth, would be the main concerns. We have
re-engineered ourselves,' says Mr Goutard. Net profits actually grew
marginally last year - in the depths of recession in European auto markets.
Valeo has continued to invest heavily in research and development, training
and the upgrading of its workforce, through extensive recruitment of
graduate engineers, to equip it for the next growth phase, which Mr Goutard
believes is well under way.
He forecasts Valeo will increase turnover by 50 per cent by the year 2000 to
FFr30bn, including a doubling of sales outside western Europe. Already this
year it has taken over a clutch business and set up an aluminium radiator
operation in Argentina. It has also set up joint ventures in automotive air
conditioning, heaters, wipers and electric motors in China, and taken over
Borg Instruments, a specialist German automotive electronics company.
Having successfully managed recession, Valeo now faces the challenge of
managing growth without getting fat. 'In a receding market everyone knows
belt-tightening is the order of the day, but everyone goes mad in a growth
environment. It is very difficult to run a tight ship,' warns Mr Goutard.
'The next years will be growth without inflation. We will not be able to
pass on cost increases to customers. We cannot count on inflation to erase
our sins, so we had better not sin.'

FT  03 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Time to help Nigeria
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nigeria is gripped by a crisis that threatens to become a catastrophe, not
only for Africa's most populous nation but for the region that it dominates.
Only Nigerians themselves can resolve the most serious challenge to their
country's stability since the Biafran war, but their deepening predicament
also calls for a constructive and imaginative response from the
international community.
A strike by oil workers in support of jailed opposition leader Moshood
Abiola has already cut the country's petroleum exports by a fifth, the first
time production has been disrupted since the Biafran conflict. This is due
to become a general strike today, deepening the confrontation between the
military government of General Sani Abacha and supporters of Mr Abiola,
victor in last year's annulled presidential election. It will be backed by
many other Nigerians driven to despair by mismanagement, corruption and
falling real incomes.
The presidential poll was deeply flawed. The two participating parties were
created by the military government, which also wrote their manifestos. Mr
Abiola, whose qualifications for the job are dubious, only emerged after the
government had banned earlier candidates.
Yet western governments did not object during the run-up to the poll, and
enough Nigerians supported the election to give it some credibility. Mr
Abiola, despite his faults, thus has a key role to play in efforts to
resolve the crisis.
Failed mediation
So far western mediators such as Rev Jesse Jackson, who went last week at
President Bill Clinton's request, have had little impact. Although Mr
Jackson's warning that violence could be imminent underlines the severity of
the crisis, his threat of increased sanctions is unwise. The only effective
measure would be to embargo Nigeria's oil exports, which at best is a policy
of last resort; at this stage it could well do harm.
The most serious danger Nigeria faces is that of a power vacuum. The
military regime could be toppled by a combination of protesters taking to
the streets and army officers prepared to hand over to a civil authority.
The trouble is that there is no credible alternative government waiting to
take over: not even the current crisis has been enough to bring together an
opposition divided by ethnic, regional and personality differences.
Nigerians opposed to military rule need to understand that neither sanctions
nor any other form of external intervention can on their own rescue them
from their predicament. Before the international community can assist,
opposition members must set aside their differences, while Gen Abacha and Mr
Abiola must realise that their country's survival depends on a modicum of
co-operation between them.
Coalition government
South Africa may provide a precedent. If that once bitterly divided country
could lay a foundation for renewal through a coalition government of limited
duration, so can Nigeria. Mr Abiola can claim a right to lead such an
administration, but it cannot exclude Gen Abacha, or another senior officer,
for the military's role in maintaining law and order will be essential.
To overcome opposition from the north, Mr Abiola, whose stronghold is the
Yoruba dominated south, should limit the transition to no more than two
years. At the end of that period Mr Abiola should stand down, and agree not
to run for re-election. Key portfolios - finance, the central bank, the
state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation - should go to
technocrats. As a condition for debt relief, the accounts of these
institutions must be monitored by resident officials from the World Bank and
the IMF, who would assist Nigeria implement the country's lapsed economic
reform programme.
If Nigeria is prepared to help itself, western creditors must be ready with
their support, offering a debt write-off and rescheduling which reduces
Nigeria's annual servicing commitments to no more than 20 per cent of export
earnings. There can be no guarantee that such a proposal would succeed. But
Nigerians, like South Africans, may come to realise that the alternative is
too ghastly to contemplate.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Waiting for the mist to clear: A crucial part of the London
share trading system faces calls for reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like toothpaste which cannot be returned to the tube once it has been
squeezed out, London's share trading system may be irrevocably altered by
inquiries begun by the City regulators.
Over the past six months, a debate has been heating up about London Stock
Exchange rules which give privileges to a handful of securities firms in
exchange for ensuring there is always a market in listed shares. Such
'marketmakers' are legally obliged to buy and sell large blocks of shares
even in turbulent markets.
In June, the Office of Fair Trading launched an inquiry into whether
existing practices were anti-competitive. Earlier this year, a report by the
Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, questioned
whether the rules were necessary. That report raised the question of whether
such privileges - for instance, a right to withhold temporarily some
information about share prices from investors  - were damaging investors'
interests.
Although Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman, says the report was intended to
stimulate debate, rather than prompt reform, London's marketmakers are glum.
'We are at the stage where the microscope is on the strengths and weaknesses
of the marketmaking system,' says the head of one of the City's largest
marketmaking firms. 'The fact that SIB has drawn attention to the system has
increased the pressure for change.'
The future of marketmaking is important for leading securities houses
because, since the 1986 'Big Bang' deregulated the City, it has become an
integral part of their services. Old-style 'jobbers', who once only made
markets, are now part of firms which also act as brokers and underwriters,
and trade in derivatives - complex instruments whose value is based in part
on that of an underlying financial market.
If the rules governing marketmaking changed, it would become a less
profitable business. But it is not clear whether firms could easily withdraw
from marketmaking without damaging other parts of their businesses.
The dilemma over rules for securities trading comes when competition is
rising from Continental European bourses. London's marketmakers say that the
current system means that, even in turbulent conditions, investors can buy
and sell large blocks of shares with relative ease. If it were altered, they
argue, the City would lose its competitive edge.
But futures exchanges and foreign securities houses disagree, and are
anxious for reform.
Futures exchanges say that the lack of transparency in the current system
means that London derivatives prices do not accurately reflect the price of
the underlying shares, and consequently investors are staying away. Mr
Daniel Hodson, chief executive of the London International Financial Futures
Exchange, says the volume of derivatives trading in London is below that in
Continental European centres.
London branches of foreign securities houses say customers increasingly
prefer other European markets, where the rules are more familiar and each
share deal is declared as soon as it is concluded.
Marketmakers counter that introducing greater transparency would allow
competitors to see their positions - roughly akin to viewing a fellow
poker-player's hand. They point out that they are putting their capital at
risk to make markets for the benefit of others and that they are entitled to
something in return.
They cite the three years following Big Bang, when they suffered swingeing
losses under a transparent trading regime. That episode led to the current
rules, which allow marketmakers to delay releasing details of deals
involving large blocks of shares.
This delay gives marketmakers time to sell shares without other securities
houses knowing there is a big seller in the market. But Mr Michael Marks,
chief executive at Smith New Court, one of London's leading marketmakers,
argues that the current delays are often not long enough for them to hedge
risks involved in making markets: 'I believe that we need marginally less
transparency, not more.'
Marketmakers warn that, if transparency was increased, they would limit the
capital they commit to trading, harming investors' interests.
Most institutional investors support the marketmakers' arguments. They feel
liquidity is more important than transparency, says Mr Geoff Lindey,
chairman of the investment committee of the National Association of Pension
Funds.
But such support is not universal. Mr Dick Barfield, investment director at
Standard Life, one of the UK's largest life insurance companies, says many
investors are unaware that a lack of transparency has a cost. 'What
institutions don't realise is that very often, when they are dealing in
shares at a rate which requires immediate disclosure, someone else is
dealing in a larger size at a better price. They just don't know there is a
better price.'
Stock exchange statistics support Mr Barfield's view. Last year, just over
half of the largest share deals (those worth more than Pounds 1m) were
struck at prices better than the best publicly available price.
But foreign securities firms, in particular, say that the real difficulty is
not lack of transparency, but the system itself. Most Continental bourses
operate 'order-driven' systems, in which no participant is obliged to make a
market and, when any deal is struck, details are immediately available to
all.
If London operated such a system, investors would know the true prices at
which transactions were being conducted, the foreign firms say. Moreover,
they dispute the claim of marketmakers that the London system provides
greater liquidity, arguing that increased investor confidence would increase
investor participation.
'We keep trying to fudge a system which is fundamentally flawed,' says Mr
Chris Salter, executive director in charge of trading at Swiss Bank Corp. He
believes this is increasingly putting the London Stock Exchange at a
disadvantage.
To an extent, it is hard to see why: since 1988 the stock exchange has
operated what is in effect an electronic 'bulletin board' - the Seaq
International system - where marketmakers post the prices at which they are
prepared to deal. Because UK securities houses were prepared to risk capital
in a way Continental firms were not, London quickly dominated trading in
shares across Europe's borders.
But in recent years, Continental bourses have been fighting back, altering
their systems to make it easier to trade large blocks of shares. Recognising
the profit opportunities, Continental securities houses have become more
willing to use their own capital to buy shares, taking on a kind of
marketmaking role.
These efforts are showing signs of success. Turnover on the Paris bourse in
the first half of 1994 was 67 per cent higher than in the same period last
year.
The London Stock Exchange counters that Seaq International turnover
increased by a similar amount. That, it says, reinforces its view that no
change to the current rules for marketmakers is necessary. As the OFT
inquiry proceeds and the pressure for reform increases, that position may be
harder to sustain. One sign that even the exchange perhaps realises change
is in the air was its decision this spring to build into the replacement
version of Seaq a facility that would allow for an 'order-driven' system.

<TEXT>
Sir, I was surprised and dismayed that a journal with the reputation and
status of the FT should give space to the silly and bigoted views expressed
by Michael Thompson-Noel (Hawks and Handsaws, July 23/24) about 'people from
the regions' (is not the south-east a region?). I suggest a little quiet
introspective research would be appropriate before he applies the expression
'micro-brained' to others.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Perhaps Mr Jacques Toubon could do something really useful now that
France's Constitutional Council has stymied his bid for language
protectionism ('Toubon vows to continue his war of words', August 1) . A
glossary of so-called English/American words that have taken on a life of
their own in Franglais would be handy, together with current pronunciation.
Weekends and hamburgers are clearly no problem for native English speakers
trying to do the right thing in French. But I need frequent updates these
days on items such as le footing, le jogging, le forcing, les baskets, le
sweat (pronounced sweet). As of today, they apparently translate as jogging,
track-suit pants, putting on the pressure, trainers (sport shoes),
sweat-shirt. Le feedback, please.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK needs a champion of superhighways
cause
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MATTHEW J KAPP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The trade and industry select committee is right to warn of the dangers
of the UK lagging behind the US and Japan in the development of interactive
'information superhighways' ('MPs urge early lifting of ban on BT video
service', July 28). If information is the key to competitiveness in the next
century, then an 'information superhighway' will be pivotal to the UK's
economic success.
However, many people have not yet come to terms with the profound social and
economic implications which flow from the 'multi-media revolution'. A recent
survey commissioned by 3Com of 200 large UK companies showed that more than
two-thirds of Britain's managing directors do not understand the phrase
'information superhighway'. These findings contrast with a similar survey
carried out by the American Electronics Association earlier this year
indicating a much greater appreciation of the need for, and the benefits of,
the superhighway among American business.
British business is lagging behind, because the US federal government has
clearly articulated the superhighways vision to a broad cross-section of the
population. As soon as the Clinton administration took office it developed a
technology policy, with its superhighways initiative - the National
Information Infrastructure - as the symbol for economic growth, the
expansion of jobs and a vital tool in promoting education and healthcare
reform. It may be distorted, but today many Americans have absolutely no
doubt that some kind of connection to the information superhighway exists in
the future and they are going to have to become familiar with it.
The UK needs an equivalent of Vice-President Al Gore, someone who will
capture the imagination, champion the superhighways cause and spur industry
into action. We decidedly do not need substantive government intervention
but there should be active engagement.
The differences between Britain and the US may be more rhetorical than real,
but in America there is some real understanding of the scale of change under
way and the potential which it creates. Unless the British government takes
a more active role in setting out the vision to both business and the
public, we may be consigned to the crawler lane of the information
superhighway.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Fate adds poignancy to Wilde's
characters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN P HERON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The comment of your critic (Theatre, July 27) on Lady Windermere's Fan
that 'Wilde's parade of fictitious titled characters, both on-stage and off,
seems absurd now: why should they be titled?' calls for the observation that
by 1914 a very numerous titled class had in fact accumulated in
(non-revolutionary) Britain.
The men of this class were decimated in the first world war, and the wealth
of this class was considerably reduced. I cannot quote numbers, but my
grandfather had a prosperous business manufacturing Turkish and Egyptian
cigarettes for these gentlemen. As they gallantly went 'over the top', the
business fell away - never to recover.
Consideration of the fate awaiting these characters in real life off-stage
adds poignancy to the brilliance of the play, as does the thought of Wilde's
own sad fate.

Sir, I was interested to see Antony Thorncroft's comment in his obituary of
Lord Delfont (July 29): 'Sometimes his judgment wavered . . . and he
rejected an investment in Monty Python's Life of Brian because he thought it
was blasphemous.' To me, this decision, far from indicating poor judgment,
says more about Lord Delfont - and puts him in a more positive light - than
all the other glowing comments in the rest of the obituary put together.

Sir, If the Post Office is sold off, will it really become more competitive
and more efficient?
On June 20 I wrote to the Post Office at Lincoln pointing out that a
correctly stamped, first class parcel, posted by our supplier on June 3,
reached our customer at Oakham on June 13.
This letter was acknowledged by The Royal Mail at Doncaster on June 23
saying: 'Perhaps I should explain that Royal Mail wish to ensure that their
customers receive the best possible standard of service, which is why we
have provided local contact points for all enquiries and complaints.
'I hope, therefore, that you will understand why I am forwarding your
enquiry to your local customer care unit at Nottingham Customer Care.
'I can assure you that the staff there will be only too pleased to help and
reply to you as quickly as possible.'
On June 29, I received the following letter from the Customer Care Centre at
Nottingham:
'I am writing to let you know that this is now being dealt with by
Parcelforce. You can contact them at Customer Care, Parcelforce, Glasgow.
They will make enquiries and reply to you as soon as possible.'
As yet, I await a positive reply.
Can Glasgow have any idea what goes on between Lincoln and Oakham?

FT  03 AUG 94 / Not the way to do it: Military intervention in civil wars is
unlikely to procure peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is beginning to look as though the war in Bosnia will go on for a
considerable while, and there is not much the outside world can do about it.
The Bosnian Serbs have turned down the latest international peace plan, even
though it would give them a disproportionate share of the territory of
Bosnia. But evidently they think they are in a position to keep, by military
force, much more than they are being offered at the negotiating table; and
it seems unlikely that they will be deterred by the threats of the outside
world to tighten sanctions on Serbia.
Three weeks ago, the members of the Contact Group (the US, UK, France,
Germany and Russia) apparently hoped they could shove through the new peace
plan, which would divide Bosnia in almost equal halves between the Serbs and
their Moslem and Croat adversaries. But any bravado quickly evaporated when
the plan was turned down by the Bosnian Serbs, and Saturday's meeting of the
Contact Group was a pretty limp affair.
At American insistence, the final communique included a half-hearted threat
that the international community might lift the arms embargo on the Moslems.
But everybody knows that the UK, France and Russia are deeply opposed to
such a move; the UK and France because it would aggravate the war, without
necessarily bringing peace closer, Russia because of its historic links with
the Serbs.
Britain and France warn that a wider war would force the withdrawal of their
troops from the UN force, and thus the abandonment of their vital
humanitarian and peacekeeping mission. The trouble is that the credibility
of the UN peacekeeping role in Bosnia already looks to be in jeopardy.
The legitimacy of the UK and French military presence in Bosnia received a
sharp and unexpected blow from Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN
secretary-general, when he openly called for the withdrawal of the UN
troops, on the grounds that they were insufficient for the task. His remark
was quickly followed by a Serb attack on a British UN convoy, killing one
soldier and wounding another; evidently the Serbs have been encouraged to
think they may be able to drive the UN out, so that they can get on with
their conquest of Bosnia without interference from the outside world.
All in all, we have come a long way from the intoxicating optimism of five
years ago, that the fall of the Berlin wall would lead to the establishment
of a new international order. The Gulf war looked like a spectacular
harbinger of a new era of international governance under the auspices of a
revitalised UN; and it spawned a new self-confident doctrine that the
international community had a 'right of intervention' in countries that were
behaving badly. But though the UN has indeed expanded its peacekeeping and
humanitarian efforts, the balance sheet between success and failure is so
far pretty dismal, and those early hopes have shrivelled.
Civil wars have been erupting on a far bigger scale than the capability of
the UN and the international community to deal with them. There seems no end
to the scenes of carnage and brutality which we see daily on our TV screens,
from Somalia, Bosnia, Cambodia, Haiti and Rwanda.
Conscience cries out to denounce the UN, or the Americans, or the European
Union, or the UK government, for not putting a stop to the suffering and the
wickedness. But it is not rational to give way to the temptation to be
indignant with the great powers for failing to bring in the brave new
post-cold-war world. The nightly television images show us with
heart-rending immediacy the irresistible need for us to help; but the TV
bulletins do not tell us what to do to stop the killing.
The mere invocation of the doctrine of the 'right of intervention' does not
provide any method, let alone an easy or reliable one, of stopping a civil
war before the warring parties are ready to make peace. There has been a
peaceful transfer of power in South Africa, because the whites finally saw
this was their least bad option; the Israelis have done a deal with the
Palestine Liberation Organisation, because they finally saw this was their
least bad option. Outside pressure and persuasion may help, but peace is
made inside.
The second hard reality is that, while television images may generate
enormous emotional and moral demands that 'something must be done', it is
not necessarily in the interest of any national government, or even of the
international community as a whole, to do it. Humanitarian aid justifies
itself, and many governments can be bounced into supplying it. But sending a
military intervention to stop the violence, in which the risk of our
soldiers being killed is much higher than the probability of stopping the
fighting, is an entirely different thing.
Many people criticise the EU for failing to stop the war in former
Yugoslavia; and some even identify a precise moment two years ago when they
believe the war could probably have been stopped with minimal use of
military force. The problem arises with the word 'probably'. For if minimal
force had failed to bring off a quick and easy miracle, should governments
have accepted an open-ended commitment to impose a 'settlement' with
unlimited forces for an indeterminate period?
The question answers itself.
The heart of the matter is that only those at war can make peace; only they
can know the terms that will make a durable peace, and even they may be
deeply mistaken; and there is no logical reason to suppose that large-scale
military intervention from outside will provide the key to that peace,
unless that intervention is intended to be permanent.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Arts: The Card - Entrepreneurs with a difference / Review of
a musical based on an Arnold Bennett hero and a play about deep-freezing
bodies for profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The hero of Arnold Bennett's The Card epitomises the entrepreneurial spirit
with a human face. Denry Machin's charm, chutzpah and cheerfulness enable
him to soar from washerwoman's son to mayor in a series of audacious bounds
that include the highly dubious 'Universal Thrift Club': a way of inveigling
the poor into buying goods on lashings of credit. Acclaim for this
philanthropic initiative bespeaks a touching innocence long dead.
At the Open Air Theatre, Regent's Park, a musical version of Bennett's novel
takes the stage. Book by Keith Waterhouse and Willis Hall, songs by Tony
Hatch and Jackie Trent, the show originally reached the West End in 1973,
before entrepreneurial virtues were in fashion. It returns, revised, with
additional lyrics by Anthony Drewe, just as entrepreneurial values are being
discredited. It lacks its protagonist's sense of timing. Whether it shares
his resilience remains to be seen.
Tim Goodchild's set gives us rows of terraced-cottage front doors dominated
by the Victorian pomp of the town hall clock tower, a fit background for
young Denry's ambition never to work 'in clay' ('pottery's for mugs . . .
crockery's not my cup of tea'). The stage is banked by a collage of plates,
dishes and tea-pots, a reminder of what the prosperity of Bennett's Five
Towns was literally built on.
Doors swivel to reveal the office where junior clerk Denry purloins a
socially advantageous invitation to the municipal ball, the terpsichorean
academy where he meets the gold-digging dancing teacher, and the stately
home of the Countess of Chell. The attitude to this aristo is intriguingly
feudal for an industrial society: the local do-gooder, she is respected,
revered and credited with the sort of glamour we used to attribute to
royalty. The musical makes it plain what a good egg she is with a sad little
song of frustration which Hayley Mills delivers rather touchingly in
well-bred, slightly flat sprechgesang.
Interestingly, the best songs are those of aspiration or yearning. Ruth, the
calculating dancing-mistress, is given the first of several songs ('Another
time, another place') where characters long for something better. This is in
keeping with the optimism permeating a story of get-up-and-go, but the
general impression is formulaic. One can see the ingredients being ticked
off: romantic ballad, self-doubting but heroically determined soliloquy,
rollicking company number. The song explaining the function of the Thrift
Club seems a distant descendant of 'Pass it along' from Bernstein's Candide,
but opts for bland jollity without any bite.
The same might be said of the whole show. For all the enthusiasm of Ian
Talbot's production, a terrible sameness sets in after 20 minutes or so. The
peaks are not high enough, as witness the big laudatory number halfway
through the second act, 'The Card' - one of those ensembles of glorification
like 'Hello Dolly' or 'Mame' which should sweep us unresistingly into
believing in a star. Here the sentiments seem on auto-pilot.
The present cast carry it off, however, because Denry is played by Peter
Duncan who beamingly capers, cavorts and connives his ingratiating way
through the piece, even prompting applause for backing a car through a
narrow opening while singing. He carries the evening since John Turner's
bluff councillor has only a stereotype to work with, Jessica Martin is
unable to blend gold-digging with romantic longings and ends up as not very
convincing at either, and Jenna Russell, as the down-to-earth local girl who
finally wins Denry, is conceived in terms of cliche. Even the dour figure of
Denry's mother, marching across the stage from time to time with a
deflationary comment on her son, t her teeth into.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Arts: The Life of The World to Come
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On August 2 1894, as FT readers may already be aware, death duties were
introduced in Britain. It would be nice to think that Rod Williams' The Life
of the World to Come at the Almeida Theatre was part of a celebration of
this centenary. But it seems more likely to be a lucky chance, part of the
general hit and miss of a not very cohesive play.
It begins promisingly enough, with an accountant discussing tax loopholes
with his client. It gradually becomes clear that these projected investments
over, say, 100 years (we are talking over Dollars 9bn by the end) and the
avoidance of death duties are postulated on the client not dying but going
into 'temporary cessation of vital processes'. This is the world of
cryonics; of deep-freezing a punter until a cure for his ailments, or simply
ageing, is found; then attaching the severed head to an ideal body, putting
blood back into the cadaver, and waking him to an eternal youth, a few
fiscal nest eggs and a possible case of frostbite. This is the world where
being a pensioner leads to being a 'suspensioner . . . Not dead, merely
incapax . . . A win-win situation . . . simply no down side.'
What sounds like one of the wilder satirical flights from Brave New World is
currently taken very seriously in America and is, inevitably, attracting big
money. The scene looks set for a swingeing attack on the barmier fads of our
day at the very least, even though the scene is tentatively played with flat
reticence, as if by actors more used to performing to mike or camera than
projecting in a theatre.
Unfortunately the play swerves between farce and sitcom, satire and moral
exploration. Nearly four years in the writing, the piece simply fails to
hang together. A plot is less important than the style, a deadpan look at
the contrast between the kitsch solemnity surrounding death (or
pseudo-death) and the cynical realities of business: territory familiar from
The Loved One and The American Way of Death. The cynical realities of
science, too, where the suspensioners are experimented on by the brilliant
Makoto in his quest to 'thaw out the stiffs', only to be incinerated when he
fails to revivify them.
Derek Wax, who directed the powerfully claustrophobic No Remission for the
same author (and group, Midnight Theatre Company), lacks the incisiveness to
impose shape on the generally garbled goings on. Act 1 ends with the
revelation that the cryonics firm's smoothy director sees his work as
'consecrated euthanasia' where 'we give our patients death, club class', and
has no intention of resuscitating the clients. In Act 2 the plot gets going
in earnest when Makoto succeeds in resurrecting the company's late
president, an improbably young man who combines a Baywatch build with the
business hustle that made the American Dream and, even more improbably, a
conscience.
For this medical breakthrough (announced by the naked patient racing around
the stage pursued by amazed doctors) triggers off general horror all round.
The last thing share-holders want is the status quo to be disturbed; but
idealist young Steve is shocked at millions being deceived. Here the play
shows signs of confusing rewrites. For a president, Steve seems to know
nothing of the company he presides over. The lovely Marilyn Shriver
(employed to bring an element of spirituality to her position of 'closure
therapist') treats him as a stranger even though she has been admiring his
'suspended' nude body, on display in a showcase as an inspiration to
aspiring patients. Illogicalities and inconsistencies abound, not least when
she tearfully talks Steve back into his living death - from which, we know,
his business associates will make sure he never returns.
The satire never quite takes shape, and we are left with jokes about jargon
('Don't go quichey on me,' snarls the villainous businessman to a colleague
afflicted with scruples) and two good performances. Simon Burke's Steve has
evidently had his shrewd head attached to a pretty good body which he
unabashedly displays; and the excellent Dearbhla Molloy, rather wasted,
almost makes a living human being out of blonde comforter Marilyn. For the
rest, the patients are not the only ones in suspended animation on stage.

Being typecast is not a problem for Jane Horrocks the waif-like actress
whose recent roles have ranged from Sally Bowles in the stage version of
Cabaret to the fluffy secretary in Absolutely Fabulous. Tonight (BBC 2 at
9.25pm) in Suffer the Little Children she tackles a more emotionally
demanding role (reviewed above by Clement Crisp).
Man the Hunter is the theme of Desmond Morris's second investigation of The
Human Animal (BBC 1 at 9.30). There is a kind of spurious intellectualism
over the attempt to explain that the competitiveness and violence men needed
when hunting for food is now chanelled into sport. Where does this leave the
development of woman? Is she unchanged and should she stay minding the
children and the hearth?
In Witness (Channel 4 at 9 pm) former nun Karen Armstrong lays the blame for
the ills of the world at the feet of the current Pope who she sees as a
reactionary absolute monarch. Not much Christian charity observable here. At
11pm on the same channel Darcus Howe plays Devil's Advocate, quizzing Imran
Khan about cricketers' dirty tricks.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Arts: Some jewels among the dross - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a theory that television schedules during high summer offer little
but pap for the silly-season viewer. The past week's programmes were
certainly well-stuffed with junk: Pets win Prizes on BBC 1, ideal for anyone
with an IQ in single figures; the same channel's Punt and Dennis Show, as
merry as an outbreak of dengue; the shrill Grace under Fire on BBC 2, which
is a barrage of machine-tooled American predictabilities about the wittily
named Grace Kelly. (Gosh, how do script-writers think of such japes?) Here
was essential viewing for people anxious to know how many garments a goat
can pull off a clothes-line, or whether an adenoidal divorcee will get
another man - and presumably pull his clothes off, too.
But there were rewards for grown-ups as well. I am no believer in 'the
majesty of human suffering'. De Vigny's phrase rings inordinately hollow as,
daily, television shows us the self-inflicted wounds of the Rwandan people,
and the reign of cholera over the dispossessed and terrified. And yet, there
is a massive dignity to fighting men who have suffered through battle and
the privations of prison camp, and this was the sustaining thread of The
Valour and the Horror, a two-hour Canadian documentary shown on Sunday on
Channel 4 about a war-time incident too little known.
In 1941, two thousand Canadian soldiers, young and unprepared, were sent to
Hong Kong to help defend the colony against Japanese invasion. Churchill had
privately declared Hong Kong impossible to save. Nevertheless, Canadian (and
Indian) troops were despatched to bolster the British forces. Their
sufferings after surrender - massacred in hospital beds, maltreated in
prison camp, used as slave labour in Japan  - were the immediate matter of
the programme. Underlying this were graver questions about government
decisions (British as well as Canadian) and the rightness of the expedition.
Archive footage, dramatisation of soldiers' letters and diaries (well done,
though the fine young actors looked too healthy, too glossy), and the
presence of two survivors were the means of an horrific narrative.
With immense dignity the two survivors, Sergeant Manchester and Sergeant
Clayton recounted their experiences, from beatings to beri-beri. Confronted
with Japanese participants in the same battle and a witness of their Tokyo
slavery, they showed astonishing self-control. It broke only at the end as
they stood by the graves of their comrades (early on, Sergeant Clayton had
said that other people 'look at stones. We look at people'). Tears, at last,
from them. Tears, surely, from those who watched. But, and here was the
programme's barb, no compensation, no reparations even now for the
survivors' sufferings. Two further programmes are scheduled.
Tears from me, unashamedly, watching Jane Horrocks in Suffer the Little
Children which will be transmitted tonight in BBC2's Stages series. (You can
view it as the essential antidote to Grace under Fire which precedes it.)
Jack Emery's monologue lasts nearly 40 minutes, and every minute counts as
Miss Horrocks plays Deborah, a young mother whose first baby, Daniel, is
born suffering from spinal muscular atrophy. (I infer that the story is
based on fact.) Deborah's prodigious devotion keeps the child alive for a
short time. A second son, Michael, is then born deformed. Once again Deborah
devotes herself to trying to save him, despite medical advice that the
child's life can be nothing but torment to him. Her love, and the tremulous
joy she finds in his personality, are eventually worn away by his ceaseless
physical anguish. Driven far beyond despair, she kills him and then attempts
suicide. The monologue is her account - detailed, reasonable, yet always on
the brink of an abyss of pain - of the child's sufferings and her own fight
for its life, in a police interview room.
It is undeniably harrowing. It is also, because of Miss Horrocks' exquisite
skill and tact as an actress, undeniably beautiful. With nothing forced and
nothing faked, Miss Horrocks tells us everything about Deborah's bravery,
her persistence, her exhaustion of body and spirit. She shows us Deborah
plain. It is a thrilling, heart-tearing performance, astonishing in its
physical precision - the ball of handkerchief scrubbing at tears - as in its
shape, leading to one true and terrible crescendo when she describes her
suicide attempt. Jack Emery's script is admirable. So is the direction by
Betsan Morris-Evans, sensitively judged in pace and manner. Not to be
missed.
Something I think would not be missed was the return of Channel 4's dance
series, Tights, Camera, Action], that bran-tub of post-modern romping. (An
alternative title might be Unlucky Dip.) In the first programme, on Friday,
we were offered a trio of films that should make all but the most perfervid
fan switch over to a re-run of Porridge. We had dance as assault and
battery; dance as non-dance; dance as feminist self-indulgence. We saw a
slam-bang duet by Edouard Lock, shot in black and white, the girl boasting
legs worthy of a wing three-quarter, and needing them to support her chap,
swinging from her as from a trapeze. There followed an inept silent-movie
adventure from France, for a senorita, a matador and a caliph, with - it
being French post-modernism - not a step or a moment of sense in sight.
Finally, a document about ten mothers and daughters - none with perceptible
dance training - who behaved with consummate archness, cuddling and dragging
each other about. (Miss Horrocks' performance should show them the error of
their ways.)
Of such fatuities is the world of television dance nowadays. I recall that a
decade ago BBC TV could stage two prodigious Dance Months, crammed with
magnificent performance, and that at the same time Channel 4 provided a
grand season featuring the work of ten major modern dance creators. There
is, despite the current fashion for the vain and off-putting tosh we saw in
Tights, Camera, Action, much good new dance. And with Channel 4 providing
superb relays from Glyndebourne (last week's Onegin surely one of the finest
of opera transmissions), dance-lovers can feel distinctly under-nourished.
Instead of stimulating a dance public, such programmes are warnings about
thinnest artistic ice.
Since I think all dogs are revolting, the QED programme Revolting Dogs
(Thursday BBC 1) won my immediate sympathy. Here was a selection of those
detestable creatures (I divide dogs into two species: Yappers and Crappers),
whose behaviour - seven years' incessant barking; possessive mania worthy of
a pasha - had brought owners to their emotional knees. A nasty-looking
Alsatian and something else, over-furred and over-fanged like a Hollywood
actress, were taken to Canine Behaviour Counsellors (aka Doggie Shrinks) and
guided, after years of terrorising all and sundry, into calmer ways.
An intriguing contrast in dealing with these four-footed maniacs came on BBC
2 the next night when, in Michael Moore's TV Nation, such horrors in America
were simply hopped up on Prozac. So Willy, a log-fixated bull-pup, was
cured, as was Ruby, a grey parrot much given to tearing out her feathers.
Stuffed with Prozac 'she seems more silly and more relaxed' - and of whom,
under similar circumstances, would one not say the same? Maybe they should
try it on Tights, Camera, Action.

<TEXT>
John Howell, chief executive of Teesside Training and Enterprise council, is
moving south to become chief executive of Solotec, the Training and
Enterprise council for Bexley, Bromley, Croydon and Sutton.
Howell, 49, has been running the Middlesbrough-based TEC since April 1991.
While his predecessor had been seconded from the civil service, Howell came
from Singer UK, where he had been managing director.
His new post, which he takes up in October, represents a move back to his
roots, for Howell went to school in this part of south London, and still has
family living in the area.
Chris Hubbard, who had been Solotec's chief executive since its launch in
1991, returned to the mainstream civil service in June.
Since his departure, David Phelan, previously operations director with
British Gas South Eastern, has been acting chief executive.

FT  03 AUG 94 / People: Ocean Group seeks skipper
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nicholas Barber, 53, chief executive of Ocean Group for the last eight
years, has left the transportation conglomerate and a new pilot has yet to
be found. Peter Marshall, 67, Ocean's non-executive chairman has taken the
helm in the interim.
Barber, who joined the company in 1964, announced in April that he planned
to step down this year. He says that he had always wanted to go in his
mid-fifties so that he could spend more time on his outside interests. In
addition to being a non-executive director of Royal Insurance and Barings,
he is a governor of London Business School and a trustee of the British
Museum.
Barber took over as chief executive shortly after Ocean had defeated a
Pounds 300m takeover bid from Sir Ron Brierley, the New Zealand corporate
predator. During his tenure the company has been transformed from a
traditional shipping company into a transport services group with interests
ranging from air freight forwarding to offshore oil support services.
However, there has been some concern in the City that Ocean has not
fulfilled its early promise at the time of the unwelcome takeover bid.
Profits have stagnated, dividend growth has been sluggish, and Ocean shares
have underperformed by more than a third since Barber took over.
Sir Ron Brierley placed his hostile stake at 340p a share in September 1989
and less than two years later Ocean raised Pounds 88m through a rights issue
at 295p a share.
However, Ocean's shares are currently trading at 258p, valuing the company
at little over Pounds 400m.
Ian Laurie, Ocean's finance director, described Barber's departure as
'extremely amicable' and denied that he had gone earlier than planned.
However, there has been some surprise in the City that Barber has left
before his successor has been appointed.
Barber was on a three year rolling contract and will receive some sort of
'golden handshake'. It is understood that this will be mainly in the form of
enhanced pension contributions and payment in respect of his contract is
expected to be less than Pounds 100,000.
Laurie said that the search for a new chief executive was 'well in hand'.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Business and the Environment: Back to nature - Ecologists
are slowly transforming the bleak face of London's docklands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MARTINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Visitors to London's docklands marvel at the enormity of the Canary Wharf
building, at the driverless trains in their toytown colours and at the
futuristic shapes of the office buildings. They rarely admire the lapwings
or the little ringed plovers or remark on the plant life.
As for the 55,600 people who work in London's docklands, their chief link
with nature is likely to be the plants in their offices.
The London Docklands Development Corporation, the government-appointed
quango which has been running 22sq kms of land east of the Tower of London
since 1981, wants to change that by establishing ecological projects in the
area.
Last summer, it commissioned a wildlife survey of docklands by members of
the Trust for Urban Ecology. They concentrated their efforts on the Limmo
peninsula of the River Lea, east of the Isle of Dogs. The peninsula is split
in half by the Beckton extension of the Docklands Light Railway.
The survey found birds such as cormorants, lapwings, little ringed plovers,
shags and grebes. In the 12 acres of former railway sidings on the peninsula
and the East India basin nearby, it recorded 140 plant species, including
some from as far afield as South America and Indonesia.
Bishop's weed, silky bent, Austrian camomile and Sumatran fleabane were
found growing beside the belching traffic on the main road. The rare seeds
are thought to have been the offshoot of cargo deliveries of old.
Since then, walkways and a footbridge have been built to link Bow Creek with
the proposed Canning Town interchange and the residential areas separated by
one of the busiest roads in London. The money came partly from Pounds 3m
devoted to environmental improvements along the DLR extension which opened
earlier this year.
The LDDC is expected to agree a further Pounds 1.5m for the ecology park
this summer. Designs for an ambitious environmentally-friendly nature centre
will require further funding this year.
Much of the impetus for the work, says the corporation, has come from the
completion of large-scale infrastructure projects such as the Limehouse Link
road, completed last year, and the DLR extension. With such work completed,
time could be devoted to environmental enhancement.
LDDC spokesman John Williams says: 'We have been concentrating on putting in
the infrastructure over the last four or five years. Now it is in place, the
time is right to make it as environmentally friendly and attractive as
possible.'
The corporation is sensitive to suggestions that part of the impetus for
environmental improvements has come from the mistakes of the rapid
development of the Isle of Dogs where, for example, workers now have the
option of watching bird rafts on Millwall Docks.
It points out that it has sponsored two ecological sites in Surrey Docks on
the south side of the River Thames since the early 1980s and it has spent
Pounds 95m on environmental improvements in the past 13 years. In the last
few years, this has mainly been spent on landscaping work on roads and the
DLR.
A lot of work has been spent on 'greening' the corridor of development going
out to Beckton and easing the fears of local residents - efforts which the
corporation has been criticised for lacking in the past. Much work has also
been put into reclaiming the site of an old British Gas works contaminated
with methane.
The emphasis is on a living and working environment with educational and
recreational needs coming high up on the corporation's agenda, says
Williams. 'The corporation is a regeneration authority whose primary focus
is to build buildings using former derelict land. But, having said that, we
are quite aware that we can't just go on building buildings ad infinitum and
that there has to be a balance to create a desirable living and working
environment.'
Kieron Murphy, the manager in charge of the ecological projects, says: 'We
are intensely conscious that the image of docklands in the public mind is of
Canary Wharf or negative images. It is not associated with ecological
projects and we want to do something about that.'
Eric Sorensen, the corporation's chief executive, is well aware of the
commercial benefits of such projects. 'Environmental improvement like this
is good business sense. We know from discussions with businesses that the
quality of the local environment where people work and live is of great
value. If you are in the business of attracting business, then these
features are doing a very positive good.
'Our aim is to bring the East End into line with the mainstream commercial
world by demonstrating that it's not an area of environmental hostility but
a very good one in terms of access to water and that it's a very pleasant
place to be in terms of flora and fauna. All these things are very important
to us.'
Although the cost of environmental improvements has been borne by the
corporation so far, the aim is to involve local businesses as much as
possible.
Texaco, the US energy group which moved its UK headquarters and 1,000 staff
from west London to the Isle of Dogs last year, is sponsoring the bird raft
project as part of its educational policy.
This business involvement will be of increasing importance when the
corporation pulls out of docklands in 1998. Faced with its own demise, there
is a natural desire to leave a more diverse legacy than the half-empty
Canary Wharf and the DLR. The corporation says the onus in the last few
years will fall on attracting partnerships to continue its work and to
create long-term benefits for local residents as well as those who work in
the area. To this end, it is also working closely with local authorities.
Murphy, walking around the saplings of the peninsula, is full of plans for
creating marshlands and drylands and woodland areas and fishing.
'We have so much planned for this area but until it is more ready we will
not be able to go, cap in hand, and ask for support. When we can, we will go
out and be able to say 'Look, this is what you can support: wildlife in
docklands'.'

FT  03 AUG 94 / People: Poole quits policy unit for Sturge chairmanship
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Poole, 49, a City corporate financier who had been seconded to the
prime minister's Downing Street policy unit, has been appointed group chief
executive of Sturge Holdings, one of the biggest managers of Lloyd's
underwriting agencies.
David Poole, who inherited his title last year on the death of his father,
Oliver Poole, comes from a family whose City roots go back many generations
through the family firm of Thomas Stephens Poole, Lloyd's brokers. The first
Lord Poole was a well-known City figure and a leading light in the
Conservative party. He was a former chairman of the Conservatives, Lazard
Brothers and the Financial Times.
Poole's appointment is part of a management reshuffle caused by the planned
retirement of David Coleridge, 62, a former chairman of Lloyd's, who has
headed Sturge since 1978, and been with the firm for 37 years. Coleridge
plans to retire as chairman after next year's annual meeting in February and
the board is currently seeking a successor.
Sturge has never had a chief executive before and Coleridge said yesterday
that he thought it was a mistake to 'hang around as a non-executive
chairman' when a new man had been brought in.
As one of the biggest underwriting agents at Lloyd's Sturge has been hard
hit by the problems of the London insurance market and its profits have
collapsed from Pounds 31.5m in 1990 to Pounds 1.2m last year.
However, Coleridge is optimistic that the new management could return the
firm to its old levels of profitability provided that the insurance market
continues to recover.
Poole, who was educated at Gordonstoun, Oxford and Insead, has worked at a
variety of City firms ranging from Samuel Montagu and Bland Payne to
Capel-Cure Myers and James Capel where he had been head of corporate
finance. He starts his new job on September 1.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Business and the Environment: Coal cleans up its act for a
power struggle - Spain is hosting an electricity project that could give new
life to an old energy source
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is far too late for the hundreds of thousands of coal mining jobs lost in
Europe during the last decade, but for those still with jobs in the
industry, a 335MW electricity project in the centre of Spain provides some
hope for the future.
Coal is falling from fashion - and production is down - in most European
countries as concerns grow about the effects on the environment of the
sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and carbon dioxide it emits when burned.
Some power generators such as those in the UK are turning to gas as an
alternative fuel source for power generation and others will follow their
lead as international pollution standards are tightened. But that may
provide a relatively short-term solution.
Whereas there are plentiful supplies of coal worldwide, there is less
certainty about gas, as its price is likely to rise. In any case, some
countries have limited access to gas. With the building of nuclear plants
politically difficult they want to maximise the possibilities for coal.
Clean coal technologies such as those used in the Elcogas project at
Puertollano, 200 km south of Madrid, is one way of doing this.
Elcogas is a joint venture between 11 European power and engineering
companies - Endesa of Spain and four other Spanish power groups (53 per cent
of the equity), Electricite de France (29 per cent), Electricidade de
Portugal (4 per cent), Enel of Italy (4 per cent), National Power of the UK
(4 per cent) and technology suppliers Babcock Wilcox Siemens and Krupp
Koppers - to build what they say is the world's largest and most advanced
clean coal power generation project.
It will use a technology known as Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle.
Under this, coal is pulverised to a fine powder and then passed into a
pressure vessel where it reacts with oxygen to produce carbon monoxide and
hydrogen.
Unwanted components are washed out of the gas which is then used to generate
electricity in a combined cycle turbine of
the type behind the growth of gas
in power generation in recent
years.
The technology enables coal of any quality to be used for electricity
generation at efficiencies of about 45 per cent, compared with about 40 per
cent at an existing large coal-fired power station. In addition it will
remove 99 per cent of the coal's sulphur and refine it to a high level of
purity so that it can be sold for use in the chemical industry.
According to the project participants, it produces only a quarter of the
emissions of oxides of nitrogen and 15 per cent of the dust emissions of a
conventional UK coal-fired plant fitted with dust control burners.
The companies recently signed the financial deal that will secure the
development of the Pounds 450m plant; construction is already under way. The
plant will start operating in 1996, fuelled initially by natural gas but by
coal in the following year.
IGCC is more expensive than most other technologies, which means it is a
long way from being commercially attractive in markets such as the UK which
have moved a considerable way down the competition road.
National Power says that
taking into account both capital and fuel costs, a unit of power could be
produced from an IGCC plant in the UK at 5.2p.
That compares with 4p for a unit from a new coal-fired plant filled with
emmission control equipment and 2.7p from a combined cycle gas turbine plant
of the type the company operates in the UK.
But from National Power's and other participants' point of view, the beauty
of Elcogas is that it is extremely unlikely to lose them money.
One reason is that the project has received a subsidy of about Pounds 50m
from the European Union's Thermie fund to promote clean combustion
technologies for coal and other solid fuels.
But the main bonus of Elcogas is that the Spanish electricity system,
encouraged by a government keen to find a use for Spanish coal, guarantees a
financial return for the project, provided it produces the expected amount
of electricity.
There is little to suggest that production expectations will not be met
since the IGCC technology has been successfully tested at other, if smaller,
plants run by the petroleum industry. Shell has been at the forefront of
IGCC technology and it is showing its confidence in it by building a large
plant in the Netherlands.
Carlos Lopez-Cacicedo, National Power's director of research and
engineering, said his company had considered a number of clean coal
technology schemes but that none had provided Elcogas's combination of low
risk and advanced technology.
'This is the best technology which exists and we can be confident of getting
a return on our investment, even if it is modest,' he said.
Lopez-Cacicedo said it was unlikely that IGCC could become fully competitive
in the short term but tightening environmental controls and pressure on gas
prices beyond the turn of the century could change this position.
'It could just be coal's way back into the power generation market in the
early part of the next century.'

FT  03 AUG 94 / Management: If you can't say something nice . . . - Are
references worth more than the paper they are written on?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's House of Lords ruled recently that employers have a duty to take
reasonable care when writing references about former staff members. The
ruling was hailed as a victory for employees, but how much will it really
affect the current processes of vetting job applications?
Geoff Armstrong, director general of the Institute of Personnel and
Development, believes the ruling will make little difference to the private
sector where, he says, recruiters are already circumspect about references
because of the various pieces of anti-discrimination legislation that have
emerged over the years.
The Law Lords ruled by a majority of four to one that Guardian Assurance, a
subsidiary of Guardian Royal Exchange investment group, had not taken
sufficient care when writing a reference on a former insurance salesman.
The reference stated that the salesman had 'little or no integrity and could
not be regarded as honest'. The salesman said the statement was untrue and
meant that he could not get another insurance job.
Clearly the impression of a single reference can be dangerous. Whatever
motivated this particular reference, it demonstrates that employees who
leave companies in some circumstances could, without the duty of care
imposed by the Law Lords, be exposed to malicious comment.
The case has yet to return to the Court of Appeal which will look at a claim
for damages but the decision makes clear that organisations that give poor
references can now face legal actions for claims of negligence.
Armstrong believes the ruling will encourage recruiters to do what they
often do now anyway - take references over the telephone. That way only they
know what is said.
Fraser Younson, an employment lawyer, says that a possible problem could
arise from this when a job offer is conditional on references. If the
prospective employee challenges a subsequent rejection, alleging that it was
made for some other reason such as racial discrimination, the employer would
have no written evidence of the reference to support the decision.
In practice, says Younson, the ruling is likely to mean that employers will
have to be more circumspect and careful about covering their backs.
Some referees may err on the side of praise or resort to euphemism. When an
organisation had an ineffective employee it wanted to get rid of, one
well-known ruse used to be to give him a glowing reference to help send him
packing. Some did quite well out of it, moving up the career ladder,
propelled by their very mediocrity.
As it is, recruiters must often read a reference for what it leaves out as
much as what it says. If the judgment leads to more anodyne references it
could further deprive recruiters of one of their most important sources of
information about job applicants.
'If you are looking to make a selection decision, the best predictor you can
get of the likely success of a candidate is how they performed in their
previous jobs,' says Armstrong.
'It is better than the interview, the psychometric test and all the other
devices.'
The broader recruitment industry could learn something from the practices of
headhunters. If they do their job properly, they will make several checks on
a candidate among peers and colleagues at previous places of employment.
The process is all very discreet, often over the telephone or in person and
an experienced selector should be able to sift out sufficient useful
pointers.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Management: The passage into adulthood - As it grows, the
Body Shop is striving to balance convention with creativity.
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Body Shop, the environmentally conscious toiletries business that was
founded 18 years ago, has outgrown its management structure. The need for
change was acknowledged by the company late last week, when it expanded its
board and announced the appointment of a new managing director to take
responsibility for much of the group's day-to-day management.
The changes were the result of a year-long review in which the company tried
to address the question of how it can preserve its distinctively idealistic
and innovative culture while achieving the efficiency of more orthodox
companies.
Anita Roddick, the company's flamboyant founder, has relinquished the title
of group managing director in favour of that of chief executive. The company
has appointed three new directors and changed the responsibilities of three
of the existing directors. It also indicated that it would shortly appoint
two non-executive directors.
Under the new structure, Anita Roddick will continue to be the driving force
in the search for new products. However, the responsibility for transforming
those ideas into products has been handed over to Stuart Rose, the new
managing director who was formerly in charge of corporate development.
Gordon Roddick, Anita's husband, remains as chairman of the group, but has
also handed over some executive responsibilities to Rose.
The changes are a response to the growth and increasingly international
character of the company, which made pre-tax profits of Pounds 29.7m on
sales of Pounds 195.4m in the financial year that ended last February. Its
expansion has exposed shortcomings in the loosely defined structure of the
group's top management and problems stemming from the lengthly absences of
Anita Roddick, who spends much of her time travelling to remote suppliers,
in rainforests and elsewhere.
The difficulties were brought into focus two years ago when a drop in
profits provoked concern that the company had lost control of parts of its
empire. Critics in the City of London pointed to a need to bring in more
professional management and, in particular, non-executives to provide checks
and balances to the executive directors. The complaints were reinforced by
Robert Gluckman, the company's international general manager, who left
complaining about the Roddicks' 'autocratic' style.
Gordon Roddick says he takes 'almost no notice at all' of City criticism and
dismisses Gluckman's comments as 'rubbish'. However, he says that the
problems in the company's structure had become apparent in the lack of
communication and control between different parts of the group. 'It had
reached the point where the lack of a good structure was impeding
creativity,' he says. 'Ideas were taking a long time to come through.'
In many respects, the Body Shop is confronting an issue that is faced by any
entrepreneurial company which is forced to adopt a larger, more
bureaucratic, structure as it matures.
However, the Body Shop's growth has brought with it extra complications.
Although the company wants to be efficiently organised, it does not want to
dilute its 'New Age' business values which emphasise human, animal and
environmental rights. 'We wanted to maintain within the structure the values
and vision of the company,' says Gordon Roddick.
For many other idealistic companies, growth has involved compromises. Ben
and Jerry's Ice Cream Company, which Anita Roddick describes as 'like a
brother company', has been forced to water down its unusual executive salary
policy - by which it restricted top salaries to a maximum of eight times the
pay of its lowest paid worker - with its recent decision to bring in a new
chief executive to deal with the problems of growth.
The risk that the Body Shop would become more conventional as it brought in
more outsiders who did not share the company's original philosophy was a
real one, according to one insider. 'The company wobbled on the brink of
becoming an ordinary organisation,' he says.
In trying to address this dilemma, the Body Shop conducted a brainstorming
session with its 22 most senior managers. Over a day and a half, they were
invited to come up with all conceivable criticisms of the company's
workings, after which they discussed possible solutions.
It also sought advice from Ichak Adizes, an Israeli management consultant.
Gordon Roddick, who distrusts the attitude of most consultancy firms, liked
the way that Adizes dealt with business 'in very human terms'.
He was attracted to the philosophy that when businesses have grown to a
certain stage they need to create a balance between bureacracy and
creativity. 'You need to have both in constructive conflict, but neither
stronger than the other,' says Gordon Roddick.
One conclusion from this exercise was that different people should be put in
charge of the bureaucratic and creative aspects of any function. This is to
prevent the day-to-day demands on the administrative aspects of a role from
pushing out the more creative aspects.
The most distinctive feature of the organisational structure devised by the
Body Shop and its advisers is the prominent roles given to people in charge
of cultural aspects of the business. For example, one executive is
responsible for 'values and vision' and another for corporate culture. 'You
have to systematise your values and vision,' says Gordon Roddick. 'You have
to systematise corporate culture in order that it enters into the reflexes
of the business.'
Put more simply, the decision to devolve some of the responsibility for the
company's values from the Roddicks was in part, according to Gordon Roddick,
'a question of what happens if my wife and I get run over by a number 52
bus'.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Management: Ready for a crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British management is at last taking crisis management seriously, according
to a review* published by Infoplan, a public relations group whose
activities include devising strategies for dealing with corporate crises.
Crises that cause a lack of corporate sleep range from bombs to television
sets that burst into flames, says the survey of 250 major companies,
selected from the FT-A 500.
Some 92 per cent of those surveyed claimed to train all of their employees,
to a lesser or greater degree, in crisis systems and procedures. At the most
basic this would include fire drills.
Sabotage, extortion and product faults; fire; dirty tricks and fraud; and
environmental disasters were among respondents' biggest fears.
All respondents considered bombs to be a real threat to business. As
Infoplan says: 'It is therefore interesting and concerning that 52 per cent
of companies that had developed a crisis management plan with well-tested
systems and procedures, always assumed, no matter what the emergency, that
they would still have access to their own building.'
The report includes advice from the Metropolitan Police on problems such as
extortion and from the Ministry of Agriculture on food matters. (Respondents
considered the food and drinks industries to have been the most at risk in
1993 with mould growth and metal, plastic and glass slivers mentioned as
major concerns.)
Companies that were felt to have handled their own crises well included
British Midland - one of whose aeroplanes crashed in 1989 - and Perrier
which withdrew 40m bottles in 1990.
Crises believed to have been handled badly included the Hoover airfare
promotion.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Jobs: Figures add up nicely for chartered accountants - Age
is proving no barrier to future employment in at least one sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Middle class angst about job security and future full-time employment
prospects appears to be widespread this summer as many companies continue to
cut their managerial ranks in the name of global competitiveness.
But not all white-collar occupations are proving equally vulnerable. Take
chartered accountancy, for example. The latest guide to salaries in
accountancy, published by the Hays business service group for the first half
of the year, suggests the demand for accountants has started to grow
strongly again in the economic recovery. As a result, salaries for
accounting staff are rising at a much faster rate than inflation and are now
on average 5.7 per cent higher than this time last year.
The upward pressure on earnings is even more noticeable for the support
staff in accountancy, whose pay has climbed by 7.25 per cent compared with
last year. For graduate recruits in public practice the picture is very
promising, with an 8 per cent increase in their training contracts to an
annual national figure of Pounds 10,042.
Salaries for finance directors in industry and commerce have risen by a
national average of 10.5 per cent to Pounds 39,277 a year compared with the
first half of 1993, while credit control clerks have seen their national
average earnings grow by 9.5 per cent to Pounds 9,319 a year.
There have also been national average increases in pay of 8 per cent for
trainee accountants in industry and 7 per cent for general accounts clerks
with one to two years' experience.
The survey also points out that companies are recruiting accountants at all
ages and levels of experience. The lifting of recruitment freezes at the
junior end has reflected strong demand.
Even what the survey describes as 'mature candidates' are being sought by
employers to take on vacant accountancy posts. Accountancy Personnel
believes this new interest in recruiting older people is due to the
combination of the 'demographic time bomb', with not enough younger staff
available to meet demand. And the cuts made in training and recruitment
during the recession reduced the pool of skilled young people on which
employers could draw in the upturn.
But the survey also suggests there is another important reason why employers
are keen to hire mature staff, even if 40 per cent of employers still appear
actively to discriminate in job placement on grounds of age. More companies
have apparently woken up to the fact that older staff can 'best help them
attain their business goals'. It seems these more 'world-wide' applicants
can 'leave a more credible impression on the customer with whom most
accounts departments have a much more regular interface than ever before'.
The survey highlights a number of other underlying trends in the market for
accountants. In the recession, the level of earnings in accountancy between
the north and south of the country narrowed, but there are signs that the
current revival is particularly strong in southern England, and this could
lead to a rewidening of the pay gap.
It is also clear from the survey that the much-maligned public sector is
regarded as the best place for recruits to train in accountancy skills
because it offers better day release facilities and more time off from work
to revise for examinations than the private sector.
Just as important, perhaps, is that the public sector is now offering levels
of commercial salary to trained accountants competitive with the private
sector. The pressure on local councils and health authorities to improve
their internal auditing and the spread of compulsory competitive tendering
has enhanced the demand for more accountants in the public services.
But would-be accountants should not become over-confident in the bullish
jobs market. The survey also suggests many employers may be ready to hire
more candidates, but only for spells of temporary work before deciding
whether or not to offer them full-time employment. That greater prudence
also provides temporary accountants with more flexibility, which many of
them want.

Bridging the gulf
David Lodge's novel Nice Work portrayed with painful humour the
uncomprehending gulf of understanding that separates the world of
engineering from that of academia. In Britain it was ever thus. But perhaps
times are starting to change. Lucas Industries, the large Midland
engineering group, has just launched a pilot training project designed to
improve the technological literacy of its management. Managers with an
expertise in finance, sales, buying and communications are being taught the
rudiments of engineering.
The company's 'engineers for non-engineers' programme is the first of its
kind in Britain. Lucas in partnership with Warwick University's
Manufacturing Group, has been awarded Pounds 96,000 by the Department of
Employment to run a pilot scheme. It is about two-thirds of the way through
and apparently proving highly successful.
'Our aim is to create a new cadre of managers who can interpret engineering
and manufacturing issues more thoroughly and confidently', says Mr Bryan
Mason, the company's personnel director. Mr Alan Bateman from the Department
of Employment, who organises the programme, is already convinced it provides
a good model for other companies to emulate in the future.
There are 15 managers on the 12-month induction programme who are spending
30 hours a month at Warwick University learning about engineering in the
classroom, but also working on practical workplace projects at different
Lucas plants four days a month.
A second group starts the programme next month and there are plans in place
for more next year.
The company is keen to remove much of the mystery from what it regards as
the 'closed club of engineers', so other managers outside the manufacturing
process will be able to participate more intelligently in the debate and
decision-making on new product investment and design.
Lucas also sees the programme as a means of enhancing managerial career
mobility. It will not turn out fully-qualified engineers but provide the
company's managers with 'the language and confidence' to interact with its
engineers.
The company is well aware that Bosch, its main German rival, benefits
enormously from having a more technically aware management in a country
where engineering enjoys a much higher professional status
than it does in Britain. But at least the Lucas scheme looks like helping to
remedy the shortage of senior staff in the company with a real grasp of how
its gear boxes and power systems are produced.
The programme is no soft option but rigorous and intellectually demanding.
It consists of six modules covering, for instance, operational management
techniques, products and manufacturing processes, innovation and the role of
support functions. Those on the programme seem to be enthusiastic about its
value for them.
'I believe it will help us to be more effective in multi-disciplinary
management task forces', said one. 'In the past I have kept quiet when
engineers have been talking. Now I feel I can make a contribution', said
another.
The Department of Employment hopes other companies will follow the Lucas
example. The current programme may be tailor-made for Lucas's needs but it
provides a model for use elsewhere.
Managers at Lucas acknowledge their company is trying to make up for their
lamentable ignorance about the engineering process. If business schools
cannot find the time to do this, then the companies will have to fill the
gap. So far Lucas remains the lone pioneer.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Vital statistics stir up controversy: Competitive tendering
for government data collection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Central Statistical Office held an office party recently, its
Australian director Mr Bill McLennan was presented with a song.
'Oh market testing, oh market testing - who'll come a-market testing with
me?' the staff sang to the tune of 'Waltzing Matilda', with a heavy
undertone of irony.
Mr McLennan was so amused that he hung the script in his office. But as the
CSO becomes the latest Whitehall department to introduce competitive
tendering, the issue is adding a note of controversy to its operations.
Though the opportunity to compete for data collection has been welcomed by
many market research groups, the manner in which the tenders are being
organised has provoked criticism that the civil service is acting too
conservatively.
Meanwhile, the prospect of using private contractors for data collection has
provoked concern in the CSO itself about how to guarantee future data
security and continuity.
These issues are becoming increasingly pertinent, not least because the
government-funded CSO is seeking, under Mr McLennan, to introduce a stronger
business focus and extend its role beyond simply supplying statistics to the
government.
Later this month the CSO will announce the results of a tender for the
collection of retail prices index data, the first piece of data collection
to be market-tested. The data is at present collected by several hundred
staff from the Department of Employment, who report about 150,000 prices
each month from 180 locations.
The department is bidding for the contract, worth about Pounds 1m, along
with more than a dozen private-sector bidders. Taylor Nelson AGB, the
largest UK market research group, has indicated it is competing, after
successfully winning a separate contract to publish and market the CSO's
data.
Meanwhile the British Market Research Bureau, another large market research
group, has also been involved in the process, says Mr Simon Orston, its
marketing development director. But though groups such as Taylor Nelson AGB
say they welcome market testing, the tender has also generated criticism.
Mr Robert Worcester, chairman of MORI, said that although about half MORI's
turnover came from government work, his group was not bidding for the
contract. He said: 'They are looking for mechanics rather than expertise.
What they want to do is use what we consider to be inadequate sampling and
keep it business as usual.'
Consequently, he believes that if the Department of Employment does win the
bid, this 'will be as a result of structure of the brief'. He added: 'The
prime minister's speech the other day was full of good intentions (about
market testing). The sad thing is that it is being sabotaged by
middle-ranking civil servants.'
Meanwhile another group, Mintel, said it was 'disappointed' because it was
not invited to submit a bid - though it stressed that it would 'love to
tender' in future.
Officials at the CSO strongly rejected these criticisms, arguing that the
tender was advertised and that the CSO was open to reforming the system of
data collection. It was considering, they said, the use of hand-held
computers to record prices, instead of clipboards.
But they admitted that the need to ensure statistical continuity in the
series makes it difficult to envisage dramatic change.
'In something as crucial as (awarding the tender for) the RPI we have to be
very careful not only about the price but also (about) issues such as
security,' a senior official said.
These issues will become even more sensitive if the CSO embarks on the
planned further round of market testing. Although under current legislation
private groups can take part in non-compulsory surveys such as RPI, they are
barred from doing compulsory surveys, such as import and export and other
business inquiries. However, a deregulation bill that is passing through
parliament could change this.
Consequently, the CSO plans to introduce competitive tendering for part of
its business inquiries next year, and to extend it later. These inquiries
are currently conducted by more than 100 CSO staff at Newport, Gwent.
These changes would still leave the analysis of the data to the CSO.
Nevertheless, the proposals have provoked unease among some government
statisticians.
A business survey conducted recently by the CSO found that 20 per cent of
companies would not supply compulsory information to a private consultancy,
partly because of fears about business confidentiality. Introducing private
contractors might mean a decline in the response rate, officials say - a
problem that could be exacerbated if the contract changes hands every few
years.
Senior officials at the CSO said they were exploring ways to tackle this
problem. But in the meantime it seems that if the market testing proposals
do go ahead, the songs at the CSO's next office party may be rather more
controversial.

FT  03 AUG 94 / SFO casts BCCI net more widely: Arrest warrant names second
Gokal brother
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Serious Fraud Office has named a second Gokal brother in connection with
investigations it is pursuing into the collapse of Bank of Credit and
Commerce International.
The SFO confirmed yesterday that a warrant for the arrest of Mr Abbas Gokal
issued two weeks ago also names Mr Mustafa Gokal and a number of other
individuals linked to BCCI.
The two brothers, with a third, Mr Murtaza Gokal, were controllers of the
Gulf shipping group, which was the largest debtor to BCCI before it was
closed by banking regulators around the world in July 1991.
The liquidators to BCCI at accountants Touche Ross began legal action in
London last November against the three Gokal brothers for several hundred
million dollars in efforts to recover money for the bank's creditors. They
are pursuing the Gokals for damages for conspiracy and unlawful interference
with the plaintiff's business, deceit and procuring breach of contract, and
for damages and compensation for fraud.
The SFO warrant against Mr Abbas Gokal was issued after word reached British
investigators that he was travelling through Germany to north America. It
charges him with conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to falsely account in
relation to BCCI.
Mr Gokal was arrested in Frankfurt as a result of the warrant, and is
currently detained there while the police negotiate his possible extradition
to London.
His extradition could trigger one of the most significant trials so far in
relation to the alleged frauds at BCCI.
It is believed he was travelling to hold discussions at his suggestion with
the US Department of Justice and the District Attorney's Office of New York,
which had granted him temporary protection from arrest for any offences
committed before his arrival in the US.
Separately, it emerged yesterday that a Paris-based bank had launched a
bankruptcy petition against Mr Abbas Gokal for unpaid debts of Dollars 22m.
Alef Bank SA filed the petition in the High Court in London. It names Mr
Abbas Kassimali Gokal, formerly of Ascot, Berkshire, whose address is listed
as Karachi, Pakistan.
It is believed that the liquidators to BCCI have been made aware of the
petition and may attempt to block it to prevent Mr Gokal escaping their own
pursuit of substantial claims against him.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Surveyors face tougher rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Surveyors will be subject to tougher rules on the way they conduct
valuations, under draft guidelines unveiled yesterday by the Royal
Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
They will be obliged for the first time to state valuation instructions
explicitly in writing and agree them with clients. If there are
uncertainties in the valuation because of market conditions or other special
circumstances, these must be flagged in the surveyor's report.
Mr Adrian Britton, director of the general practice division of the
institution, said: 'We are quite determined that we are not going to have
valuations undertaken without both parties being clear about what the
service is.'
He said insurance companies had advised the institution that 45 per cent of
professional indemnity claims against surveyors would not have arisen if the
instructions had been written down.
The new rules will be compulsory and will replace two existing sets of
rules, only one of which was mandatory. The present mandatory rules cover
how valuations should take place but only for a limited number of types of
valuation. The other set of rules has information on producing and
conducting valuations.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Bank sticks to inflation forecast but sees short-term
decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England yesterday admitted that inflation had turned out to be
lower than expected in its last quarterly report and reduced its short-term
forecast of underlying inflation.
Nevertheless, its latest quarterly inflation report warned that, unless base
rates were increased at some point in the months ahead, underlying inflation
would be in the top half of the government's 1 per cent to 4 per cent target
range in two years.
That would conflict with the government's aim of reducing such inflation to
the lower half of the band by the end of this parliament or no later than
the second quarter of 1997.
The Bank expects underlying retail price inflation (the so-called RPIX,
which excludes mortgage interest payments) to fall to about 2.3 per cent
over the next three months from 2.4 per cent in June. Underlying inflation
will be lower than previously thought until the end of 1995 before peaking
above 3 per cent in the first quarter of 1996.
The Bank's own measure of core inflation, RPIY (which also excludes local
authority and indirect taxes) fell to a record low of 1.6 per cent in April.
The report lowers the forecast for RPIY, which is expected to remain below 3
per cent in the next two years.
Three factors have caused the Bank to alter its projections. The first, says
the report, is that 'inflation has been lower than expected over the past
three months. The squeeze on profit margins, which started in the fourth
quarter of 1993 in food retailing, has spread.'
Second, the Bank now says that the disinflationary pressure has proved
greater than anticipated. In particular, the squeeze on retail margins is
unlikely to be reversed in the near future.
The third factor cited by the Bank is in the direction of faster inflation.
It says: 'GDP data suggest that output was closer to potential by the end of
last year than previously thought.'
In spite of the downward revision in the short term, the Bank's view of the
annual inflation rate in two years is virtually unchanged. It will still be
in the top half of the target range of 1 per cent to 4 per cent in 1996 if
base rates are not increased.
Furthermore, the report argues that new inflationary risks have emerged in
the last three months. In its May report the Bank cited three inflationary
concerns, rapid money-supply growth; a rise in nominal earnings; and high
inflation expectations in the financial markets. While those risks have not
worsened, and money-supply growth has in slowed, the report adds three more
dangers.
The first is that 'commodity prices will continue to rise rapidly, pushing
up producers' output prices.' The Bank says that 'because world demand is
still sluggish, big increases in commodity prices are unlikely to continue
for long enough to have a serious impact on domestic inflation'. But it
adds: 'Further supply-side shocks would alter the outlook.'
The second risk is that profit margins, particularly in the retail sector,
may rebound after all. 'It is not clear yet,' says the report, 'whether the
structural changes in retailing which have helped to reduce margins are
permanent.'
The third danger is that the economy may be closer to its full potential
than has been projected. The Bank says this possibility has been raised by
'recent increases in land prices and costs in the construction sector'. It
also cites reports of recruitment difficulties in some sectors.
The Bank admits, however, that the risks are not all on one side. The recent
unexpectedly good retail price figures could result in a reduction of
inflation expectations. And it says says that headline unemployment figures
may be 'exaggerating the speed at which the labour market is tightening and
thus exaggerating the upward pressure on earnings'.
The Bank ends by restating that 'the stance of monetary policy must be set
on the basis of a judgment of where inflation will be in some two years or
so. This is especially important at turning points in official interest
rates.'
The report warns that 'the pressures for higher inflation in the future may
be building up even as the published inflation rate for the past continues
to fall.'

FT  03 AUG 94 / Societies say rate rises threaten recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
House prices have stabilised after recent falls but the housing market
remains weak and a rise in interest rates would threaten further recovery,
the two largest building societies warn.
Halifax and Nationwide both report that prices rose last month compared with
June, but differ widely on the extent of the increases.
Halifax said prices rose just 0.2 per cent on average to Pounds 63,563, the
second consecutive monthly increase announced by the society, which had
reported price falls in April and May.
Nationwide said prices had risen 1.8 per cent last month, the biggest
monthly rise since May 1991, after a 0.7 per cent fall in June. Mr Brian
Davis, Nationwide's chief executive, warned against reading too much into
one month's figures. He added: 'The trend so far this year has reflected a
quiet market with prices broadly unchanged over the period.'
Nationwide said prices had risen 2.1 per cent during the 12 months to the
end of July to an average Pounds 55,223. Halifax estimated the annual rate
of increase at 1 per cent. Halifax uses a bigger sample than Nationwide and
seasonally adjusts its figures.
Halifax said: 'The recovery in the housing market remains very weak and
further monthly (price) falls are possible.'
Nationwide said that 'increases significantly above the general inflation
rate are unlikely before next year and gains may remain modest compared with
the experience of previous upturns'.
Workload levels in the construction industry have risen for the first time
in more than four years, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors says
in a survey published today.
Order books of more than 200 quantity surveyors rose by 0.5 per cent during
the three months to the end of June workloads compared with the previous
three months.
Mr Christopher Vickers, the institution's construction industry spokesman,
said: 'We are now seeing the beginnings of a slow but steady upturn in
building activity. If interest rates stay at their current level then we
should begin to see the emergence of a stronger revival in both consumer and
business confidence. This could be undermined by speculation about interest
rate rises.'

FT  03 AUG 94 / Good managers hard to keep
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three-quarters of senior executives of building societies believe that
management capability will be a serious constraint for a significant number
of small societies during the next five years, according to a survey
published today, Alison Smith writes.
While this is a view more strongly held among executives of the largest
societies, more than half of senior executives in small societies - with
assets of less than Pounds 1bn - also admitted that attracting and retaining
enough good managers was a significant obstacle to be overcome. Mr John
Wriglesworth, societies analyst at UBS who compiled the survey with Mortgage
Finance Gazette, said: 'That admission amounts to signing their own death
warrants, and putting themselves up for grabs by large societies.'
The survey shows a bleaker view than five years ago, reflecting growing
competition in retail financial services and the secotor's increasing
complexity. In the earlier survey, just 45 per cent saw management
capability as a serious constraint for small societies.
The latest survey shows disenchantment with estate agency. In 1989, 97 per
cent of executives expected significant numbers of large societies to
acquire estate agents: now only 10 per cent expect them to do so.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Friendly letters give way to despair: Robert Taylor on the
lack of trust in negotiations over the signal workers' pay claim
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The signalling dispute is turning into one of the most serious industrial
conflicts for a long time. Yesterday's failure by the conciliation service
Acas to find enough common ground between the two sides to bring them back
to the negotiating table indicates that the railway network faces weekly
shutdowns into the autumn.
Only last Wednesday hopes started to rise for the settlement of a dispute
that has started to exasperate both sides. The exchange of friendly letters
between Mr Bob Horton, Railtrack chairman, and Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT's
general secretary, seemed to suggest that the two would soon be back at Acas
making a deal.
It has not turned out that way. Seasoned Acas officials have given up in
despair.
Inevitably Railtrack and the RMT have different versions about what has been
going on during the past few days.
The company is convinced that the union has never been serious about having
negotiations aimed at resolving the dispute. Management believes the union
leadership is growing increasingly out of touch with the mood of the
normally moderate signalling workers and the union is using the grievances
of the men in a wider political game to undermine the privatisation of the
railway network.
The company says that it showed a willingness to move in the talks through
Acas by even agreeing that some of the proposed 6 per cent unconsolidated
pay supplement should be integrated into signallers' basic rates, a move it
had resisted before.
According to Mr David Armstrong, the company's chief negotiator, Railtrack
also offered to have a week of non-stop negotiations on the entire
restructuring package for signalling staff which, if successful, would have
allowed the company to resolve the 'short-term payments problem'.
The union has rejected such peace offers, insisting that the signalling
staff claim for an interim payment must be settled before restructuring
talks start. In the opinion of Railtrack the RMT has not moved an inch since
the conflict started eight weeks ago.
The RMT insists that it has put a number of proposals to Acas in the past
few days that show the union is ready to be flexible. These included an
attempt to persuade the company to set out the efficiency savings that would
come from the specific proposals on changing working practices contained in
its restructuring package.
But Mr Vernon Hince, the RMT's assistant general secretary, said last night
that Railtrack had 'never addressed our claim seriously since June 8'.
The company's exasperation can be seen in its decision to heighten the
public rhetoric. Railtrack plans to decide its next step later this week.
The company said: 'We believe the RMT is out of touch with the views of
their signalling staff.'
That assertion may be tested soon. One option is for Railtrack to hold its
own ballot of the men in dispute to find out what they think.
For the first time yesterday Mr Armstrong said the offer was now a rise of
7.2 per cent on earnings for signalling workers between April 4 and October
1 and a restructuring payment from October 1 which would provide increases
on basic rates of up to 26 per cent, giving overall earnings improvements of
up to 10 per cent.
These figures look more attractive than those of eight weeks ago. The union
insists they have never been on the negotiating table.
Once more the two sides seem unable to agree on basic facts. It is this lack
of trust between the RMT and Railtrack that lies at the heart of the
conflict, with the government shifting day-to-day between being intransigent
and conciliatory.

The Black Country Development Corporation yesterday said that it had met all
the government targets for the regeneration of its area three years before
the end of its 10-year life.
The corporation was set up by the government in 1987 with the task of
reviving 10 sq miles of rundown industrial land north-west of Birmingham. In
its latest annual report it says that the government's target of creating
21,000 jobs in its area had been met.

Mr Tim Boswell, further education minister, said that all but three of the

eliminating guarantees on teaching hours.
However, he warned that a similar 'holdback' could be operated next year if
the new contracts offered by 'a very small number' of colleges proved

<TEXT>
Channel 4 is to become the first national broadcaster in the UK to transmit
widescreen programming regularly - with the help of grants from the European
Union and support from Nokia Consumer Electronics, Raymond Snoddy writes.
The channel has undertaken to screen at least 500 hours of programmes
between the launch date in October and the end of 1995. Widescreen
television is similar in shape to a cinema screen.
When Channel 4 is transmitting in widescreen those with conventional
television sets will receive 'letterbox pictures' with black bands at the
top and bottom of the screen.
Nokia is sharing Channel 4's Pounds 1.5m bill with the EU.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Bias case broker denies she lied
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A City insurance broker who is claiming unfair dismissal and sexual
discrimination told an industrial tribunal yesterday that she was sacked
after she was wrongly accused of lying to a Lloyd's underwriter while
conducting a deal.
Miss Samantha Phillips was an aviation broker for Willis Corroon. She said
she was persecuted by her manager and then ultimately fired after she
allegedly spurned the advances of Mr Giles Wilkinson, head of production at
Willis Corroon.
Mr Wilkinson denies harassing Miss Phillips and the company claims she was
dismissed for gross misconduct.
At yesterday's hearing at Croydon, south London, Miss Phillips said she had
been banned from doing business with LA Hudson, the underwriter, after a
deal had gone wrong.
When she asked for the ban to be revoked, she said she was called into a
meeting with Mr Wilkinson. She denied suggestions she had failed to inform
LA Hudson that she had contacted other underwriters about insurance cover
her company was seeking to arrange for a client.
She was later suspended, and four days after that, dismissed.
It was earlier alleged that Mr Wilkinson had made advances toward Miss
Phillips and that he interrupted a business trip in 1992 to join her in
Denmark.
She alleged that after she rebuffed him, he became 'derisive and negative'
and he once told her in front of other brokers: 'Back down, bimbo.'

FT  03 AUG 94 / Court radio ruling shows loophole
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further consolidation of the commercial-radio industry seems possible after
a High Court judge yesterday approved a scheme designed to circumvent the
existing provisions of the Broadcasting Act 1990.
The broadcasting industry has been awaiting the ruling over the legality of
the Radio Authority's decision to approve a scheme allowing Emap, the media
group, to have a stake in eight large metropolitan licences - two more than
allowed under the act.
The judgment appears to expose a loophole in the 1990 Broadcasting Act which
might require legislation to close.
Under the scheme Emap, which runs the commercial stations Radio City and
Kiss FM, proposes to extend the number of licences it holds from three to
eight by taking over Trans World Communications (TWC).
To get around the upper limit Emap devised a new corporate structure to
enable two of its licences to be 'warehoused'.
The scheme - sanctioned by the Radio Authority - involves a 'deadlocked'
company being set up with Emap and Schoders, its merchant bankers. Each
would own 50 per cent of the share capital of the new company which would
hold the two Radio City licences.
Mr Justice Schiemann yesterday dismissed an application from Guardian Media
Group, which publishes The Guardian newspaper and holds 20 per cent of TWC's
shares, for the Radio Authority's decision to be subject to judicial review.
Guardian argued that the authority had acted beyond its powers in approving
an 'artificial device' designed to evade the restrictions.
The judge ruled, however, that under the proposed structure Schroders would
not be a nominee of Emap nor act under its control.
He also ruled that the Radio Authority had not acted outside its powers.
Parliament could have legislated to prevent such schemes being devised but
it had not done so, he ruled. The authority was therefore entitled to
approve Emap's scheme. The judge refused Guardian Media Group leave to take
its case to the Court of Appeal.
Lawyers for Guardian said it would consider making its own application for
an appeal hearing.
The Radio Authority yesterday made clear that it would reserve its views on
any similar schemes until after any possible appeal and after it had
consulted its members.
The Radio Authority wants to simplify commercial radio ownership rules which
are based on a point system linked to the size of stations.
TWC said last night that it was considering its position and would give its
advice to shareholders in due course.

west-coast line between Crewe and Carlisle and we will exploit this
position.'
Lancashire Enterprises, a development consultancy set up by the county
council in 1982 but now a private company, bought the site last year from
Arthur Andersen, receivers to Leyland Daf. The consultancy leased the
assembly plant to Leyland Trucks, the company sold to a management buy-out
team after the collapse of Leyland Daf.
This company now employs 700 people on the site. A further 800 work for more
than 15 other companies, many in the automotive sector.
Negotiations to acquire 60 acres of adjacent fields will increase the site
to 306 acres.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Hoverspeed protests to EU over immigration law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hoverspeed, the cross-channel hovercraft operator, has lodged two complaints
with the European Commission over a UK law fining international transport
carriers for bringing illegal immigrants into the country.
The company, a subsidiary of Sea Containers, says that the implementation of
the act on cross-channel services between England and France is in breach of
the provisions of the Treaty of Rome guaranteeing free movement within the
European Union.
It also complains that the government is giving illegal state aid to Channel
tunnel rail services by exempting them from the fines.
Hoverspeed says that it has paid Pounds 484,000 in fines since the
introduction of the law in 1987 and spends about Pounds 100,000 a year on
checking passengers' passports to avoid liability. By exempting train
services through the tunnel, the UK government is giving it a 'hidden
subsidy', Hoverspeed says.
The accusation follows an application by Eurotunnel for a judicial review of
a Commission decision to retain duty-free sales on cross-border journeys
within the EU until 1999. Eurotunnel says that this is a hidden subsidy to
the ferries and airlines which can sell duty-free goods during journeys,
unlike train operators.
Hoverspeed's complaints will reopen the controversy over the Immigration
(Carriers' Liability) Act 1987, which imposes fines on airlines and shipping
companies which bring passengers into the UK without a valid passport or
visa.
Hoverspeed, like the airlines, opposed the act from its inception. Mr
Geoffrey Ede, managing director, said yesterday: 'To expect check-in
assistants to operate as immigration officials and to fine the operator when
they fall short is unreasonable. Their job is to welcome people on to our
SeaCats and hovercraft, not keep them off.'
He added that the government had refused to listen to Hoverspeed's
representations on the issue, leaving it no alternative but to resort to the
law.
The Home Office said last night that the exemption for Channel tunnel rail
services recognised their 'unique character'.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Postal union is warned on protests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Mail is trying to stop its employees from campaigning against the
government's proposed privatisation of the service.
It has warned officials of the Union of Communication Workers that it will
take disciplinary action against staff who wear anti-privatisation badges or
stickers produced by the union on their uniforms or who put them on Royal
Mail vehicles.
Mrs Jane Kitchen, operational developments manager in Sheffield, told the
union that drivers were being instructed 'in as non-threatening a way as
possible' to inform staff that display of stickers and badges could lead to
disciplinary action.
Royal Mail's rules on the wearing of badges point out that 'private badges
may be worn on duty, provided they are not obtrusive and are not badges of a
political party or organisation'.
The tough attitude of managers has led to disciplinary action being taken
against a union member in the Warwick and Leamington area who was
distributing the union's anti-privatisation leaflets in the sorting office.
Her appeal against the disiplinary action is to be held on Friday.

FT  03 AUG 94 / CBI rejects Portillo's call to cut business aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Confederation of British Industry yesterday came down firmly against
sweeping cuts in state support for business as the fierce debate over the
government's public spending plans gathered momentum at Westminster.
Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said the organisation supported the
government's 'existing tight programme totals' including the maintenance of
spending by the Department of Trade and Industry.
In yesterday's statement Mr Davies focused particularly on support for
British exports, saying it would be 'a great mistake' to cut government
backing for overseas trade.
He said there was 'solid research' showing that the benefit derived from
government support for exports - particularly those of smaller companies in
new markets - far outweighed the cost. Many DTI programmes were 'in effect
an investment in individual success'.
But he said public spending should not be allowed to 'overrun', while the
government's Pounds 5bn contingency reserve should be 'used to reduce
borrowing, not allocated to programmes'.
Mr Davies's intervention followed a call by Mr Michael Portillo, the new
employment secretary, for the DTI to accept drastic cuts in a large number
of its programmes.
The call, which came in a leaked letter to Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade
and industry secretary, was widely interpreted as an early sign of tensions
in the cabinet that could arise as the government struggles to stick to its
tough spending targets in this year's Budget.
It threatened to shake the uneasy truce between the left and right wings of
the Conservative party less than two weeks after Mr John Major's cabinet
reshuffle.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, yesterday responded to
the signs of increased ministerial tension by trying to drive a wedge
between Mr Portillo and Mr Jonathan Aitken, his successor as chief Treasury
secretary.
Mr Cook wrote to Mr Aitken pointing out that his Thanet constituency had
recently benefited from regional assistance and asking whether he shared Mr
Portillo's view that it should be scrapped.
'I am sure your constituents would also be interested to know whether you
share his conclusion that there is no strong case for retaining development
areas and that they should move out of the area to find work,' Mr Cook said.
Rightwing Tory MPs have voiced confidence that Mr Aitken will take as hard a
line on spending as his predecessor.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Lunn Poly to start price war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lunn Poly, the largest travel retailer, is expected today to launch a
price-cutting campaign for summer 1995, reducing the cost of a seven-day
holiday in Ibiza to Pounds 88.
The campaign, which is likely to spark a response from other travel
retailers, will offer 11 per cent reductions on summer 1995 holidays.
It follows the company's announcement yesterday that a record 9m overseas
summer holidays are likely to be sold by travel agents this year, in spite
of the hot weather in the UK.
Travel agents had sold 7.5m summer holidays by the end of June - over 1m
more than by the same time last year. A sales figure of 9m for the summer
would represent a 13 per cent increase on last year and be well above the
previous record of 8m set in 1987.
The increase comes after a warning last week by the English Tourist Board
that the growth of the overseas package holiday market was damaging the UK
tourist industry. Although a record 19.3m overseas tourists visited the UK
last year, the tourism balance of payments deficit was Pounds 3.1bn.
Lunn Poly said overseas holiday sales this year had been stimulated by
price-cutting. The average price of a summer holiday booked through Lunn
Poly by the end of June was Pounds 353 compared with Pounds 356 last year.
Spain remained the most popular destination for UK holidaymakers, increasing
its market share to 44 per cent this year from 37 per cent last year. Greece
was in second place with 16 per cent, down 1 percentage point.
The US share has fallen to 5 per cent from 6 per cent. However, the total
number of Britons buying US holidays had risen to 400,000 by the end of June
from 354,000 last year.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Berkshire housing targets attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A decision by Berkshire County Council to bow to government pressure and
establish a target of 2,667 new homes a year has angered developers and
environmentalists.
The outcome is seen as an important indication of how the government intends
to respond to developments in politically sensitive counties.
The council's environment committee, which had proposed a lower figure,
decided by a single vote to accept a recommendation from Mr John Gummer,
environment secretary, which would require the county to accept the
development of 40,000 homes between 1991 and 2006.
This is one-sixth less than the 48,000 homes recommended by independent
inspectors after a public inquiry. The Housebuilders Federation, which had
proposed a target of 54,000 homes, said yesterday it was very disappointed
that inspectors appointed by the environment department had been ignored.
The Council for the Protection of Rural England said yesterday that it 'was
disappointed that the local authority and government had not sent a stronger
signal that the environment matters in Berkshire'.
The decision to curb the supply of development sites in one of the country's
most sought-after housing markets comes as the government has been
struggling to retain the support of its traditional voters in southern
England.
Mr David Coates, national planning officer for the the Housebuilders
Federation, said it would ask Mr Gummer to reconsider the county's plan.
This was accepted by the council's environment committee after Conservative
and Labour councillors joined forces to defeat Liberal Democrats who want
the lower figure to be maintained.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Altman defiant on Whitewater
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Roger Altman, deputy secretary of the US Treasury, defiantly told
Congress last night he had never impeded inquiries into a key
Whitewater-related matter and that neither he nor any official responsible
to him had ever conveyed 'improper information' to the White House.
But he did issue a qualified apology to the Senate banking committee for
past statements that may have been misleading. Referring to controversial
testimony given on February 24, he said: 'I see now that committee members
may feel I was being too precise in my answers.'
However, Senator Al D'Amato, the New York Republican, promptly accused Mr
Altman of participating in meetings beyond number with the White House.
Mr Altman insisted that he had only held one such 'substantive' meeting on
February 2. He stuck to the list of additional 'incidental' discussions
provided in his opening statement covering all the contacts he could recall
over the status of the investigations into the bankruptcy of Madison
Guaranty, the Arkansas savings and loan company owned by Mr James McDougal,
partner of the Clinton family in the Whitewater land investment.
Critical parts of his statement appeared clearly at odds with evidence given
to the committee last night by Ms Jean Hanson, Treasury legal counsel. Mr
Altman said he did not remember asking Ms Hanson to appraise the White House
of Madison criminal 'referrals' last September, though he saw 'nothing
wrong' in her doing so. He said he never knew of the September meetings when
he testified to Congress last February.
He also disputed her recollections of his February 24 testimony. She said
she had known, but failed to tell Mr Altman, of omissions in his response to
questions about meetings and about the possibility that he would 'recuse'
(excuse) himself from any role concerning Madison, over which he then had
overall jurisdiction as acting head of the Resolution Trust Corporation.
He said he had studied the video of these hearings and could, at one pivotal
stage, be seen turning to her and asking for advice. The video was shown
later to the committee but appeared inconclusive. But Mr Altman said he and
Ms Hanson later had lunch together and she had never raised her concerns
that the answers he had given were 'incomplete'.
Mr Altman insisted that the question of his recusal (because of a long
friendship with President Bill Clinton) was 'irrelevant' because he never
knew anything about the status of the Madison investigation. 'In retrospect
I might have recused myself off the bat,' he conceded, but the three-week
delay before he did so included no action related to Madison.
Earlier the committee had questioned Mr Josh Steiner, chief of staff to Mr
Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, on the content of his subpoenaed private
diaries. Mr Steiner disowned at least some of the entries, including the
note that Mr Altman had come under severe pressure from the White House not
to recuse himself.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A one-day general strike called by Argentina's opposition parties and trade
unions, to protest at the government's free market economic policies, failed
to bring the country to a complete halt yesterday, but disrupted activity in
the capital, Buenos Aires, and seriously affected the interior of the
country.
About half the buses in Buenos Aires stayed off the streets. Although bus
and underground services ran normally, there were far fewer passengers than
usual.
However, in the city centre, it was business was usual.
Mr Victor de Gennaro, leader of the ATE public sector union, said: 'This
strike is a warning to the government to temper its arrogance and pay
attention to all sectors of society. It is a warning over falling wages, the
crisis of regional economies and the plague of unemployment.'
Reports from other cities indicated stronger support for the strike. Most
schools, shops, banks and factories in the industrial city of Rosario were
closed.
The strike was also successful in Cordoba, the cradle of Argentina's car
industry and governed by the opposition Radical party. Although the
metalworkers' union at the city's two car plants decided not to support the
stoppage, strike organisers claimed high levels of absenteeism.
This was the second general strike since President Carlos Menem took office
in 1989.
On Monday, the president declared the strike illegal, allowing companies to
sack employees who had stayed away from work.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Voluntary health plan by Mitchell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Senator George Mitchell, the leader of the Democratic majority in the US
Senate, yesterday proposed a healthcare reform bill that would require
employers to offer - but not pay for - health insurance for their workers,
with the goal of extending coverage to 95 per cent of the US population by
the year 2000.
'What I am proposing is a voluntary system which includes insurance market
reform, subsidies for the uninsured and voluntary purchasing cooperatives,'
Mr Mitchell said yesterday in presenting his plan.
The bill could be debated on the Senate floor as early as next week, during
debate in the House of Representatives on a different compromise proposal,
presented last week by Congressman Richard Gephardt, the House Democratic
majority leader.
The latter's bill, like the original plan set out by President Bill Clinton
nine months ago, would require employers to pay for 80 per cent of the cost
of their employees' health insurance.
Mr Mitchell said the Congressional budget office had agreed with him that
his bill would extend health insurance coverage to 95 per cent of the
population by 2000.
He said yesterday that 95 per cent was not universal coverage, but was 'a
very important measurement on the way to universal coverage.'
If the goal of 95 per cent is met - which would bring into the healthcare
net 25m-30m of the 35m-40m people now uninsured - a national commission
would recommend ways to move further towards universal coverage. If the goal
is not met, and if Congress does not then enact other measures to make up
the shortfall, then a requirement that employers pay half of their workers'
insurance premiums would be triggered in 2002.
Mr Mitchell said the percentage of people in the US covered by the health
system had declined from 90 per cent in 1980 to about 85 per cent, and that
100,000 people were losing their health insurance every month.
Like virtually all other health reform proposals, the Mitchell bill would
stop insurance companies dropping coverage, increasing premiums or reducing
benefits to someone who becomes ill.
States would certify non-profit health insurance purchasing co-operatives in
every region, with the existing federal employees' health benefits programme
stepping in where no other co-operative emerges.
Every business would have to offer to its employees - but not pay for - a
choice of at least three health plans, either through the co-operative, in
the case of small companies, or on its own, in the case of companies with
more than 500 employees.
Subsidies aimed at low-income families, with special emphasis on children
and pregnant women, would be introduced to encourage more people to take
advantage of the insurance offered.
Most of the cost of the bill would be met by savings on the existing
government Medicare programme, estimated at Dollars 278bn (Pounds 181bn)
over the next 10 years, and by increasing the tax on cigarettes by 45 cents
to 69 cents a pack.

FT  03 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Ericsson wins Chinese contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications group, has won a Dollars 400m
contract to extend the telecommunications network in the Chinese province of
Guangdong, the company's biggest deal to date in China.
Under the three-year agreement, signed with the Guangdong Post and
Telecommunications Bureau and Machimpex, the Chinese purchasing agency,
Ericsson will deliver mobile telephone systems, AXE switching systems for
conventional public telephone networks and transport network equipment.
Ericsson said it would also supply equipment to pave the way for the
establishment in Guangdong of broadband 'information superhighway' networks
delivering telephone, computer and television services.
China is Ericsson's fastest-growing market. It has doubled sales in both of
the past two years and carved out a significant market share. China now
ranks among Ericsson's top five country markets, accounting for some 6 per
cent of group annual sales of SKr63bn (Dollars 8bn).
The latest deal will help allay fears that Ericsson, the world's sixth
largest supplier of telecoms equipment, could lose big public projects in
China to competitors such as Alcatel of France and Siemens of Germany, which
can utilise more substantial export financing assistance  - and political
backing - from their home governments.
This year, Ericsson lost a large Saudi Arabian contract which was awarded to
AT&amp;T of the US, despite the Swedish company's belief that it had been the
lowest bidder on the original tender. Mr Lars Ramqvist, Ericsson's chief
executive, made clear before the Saudi contract was finalised that he feared
he would lose it because of lack of political clout with Riyadh.
Ericsson said discussions on financing the Guangdong project would start
immediately.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Whitewater focus shifts to diaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The private diaries of a young US Treasury official emerged yesterday
morning as the principal focus of Senate questioning on Madison Guaranty,
the failed Arkansas savings and loan institution implicated in the
Whitewater affair.
Mr Josh Steiner, chief of staff to Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary,
said his diaries had over-estimated the amount of pressure put on Mr Roger
Altman, the deputy Treasury secretary, not to excuse himself from
supervising investigations into Madison.
He also told the Senate banking committee that Mr Altman had not
deliberately misled the panel in February about the extent of White House
and Treasury contacts over the status of possible criminal actions involving
Madison, the company owned by Mr James McDougal, partner of the Clinton
family in the Whitewater land development.
The committee's session came between the brutal Monday night questioning of
Ms Jean Hanson, the Treasury legal counsel, and the eagerly awaited
appearance of Mr Altman later yesterday. Mr Altman has asserted both his
innocence of any misrepresentation to Congress and his disinclination to
resign.
Mr Steiner's diaries, however, provided a rich lode for interrogation. Most
interest centred on his note late in February that Mr Altman had 'gracefully
ducked' questions from the committee on the issue of whether he should
'recuse' (excuse) himself from regulatory responsibility in his capacity as
acting head of the Resolution Trust Corporation.
Senator Lauch Faircloth, the Republican from North Carolina, wanted to know
the difference between 'graceful ducking' and lying. Senator Phil Gramm of
Texas, again quoting from the subpoenaed diaries, wanted to know why Mr
Steiner found it 'amazing' that the recusal issue had not come up and why it
had not been volunteered to the committee.
Mr Steiner, who is 28, said he had kept his diaries for personal reasons as
a way of measuring the impact on himself of being at the heart of
policy-making. Entries were not made daily but often several weeks after the
event.
Thus, he said, his notation about the 'fateful' February 2 meeting in which
Mr Bernard Nussbaum, then White House counsel, had urged Mr Altman not to
recuse himself prematurely was made after the press had already started
reporting the issue in depth.
In any case, he argued, the question by then was 'moot' because Mr Altman
had decided to disqualify himself and because the administration had decided
to extend the statute of limitations covering any civil Madison action
beyond the February 28 expiration.
Other past and present Treasury officials also testified to their limited
knowledge of the Madison case.
Mr Dennis Foreman, Treasury ethics counsel, asserted that there was 'a
legitimate government purpose' in the Treasury appraising the White House of
pending investigations.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Abandoned to the sharks: The bloody fate of a treasury
lawyer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the great white sharks of Washington, otherwise known as US senators,
scent blood, restraint goes out of the window. Mr Roger Altman, deputy
secretary of the treasury, is a meal worth consuming. Ms Jean Hanson,
general counsel to the treasury, is just chum bait.
On Monday night the Senate banking committee chewed up Ms Hanson and spat
her out. Not that the lawyer from Minnesota, via Wall Street and with a
husband who was a Republican until recently, did not kick, fight, stick to
her guns and tell senator after senator that they did not understand what
she had said and why she did what she did.
But the real curiosity of a long and bitter night of interrogation was not
that she was under constant fire from all the predictable Republican attack
voices - the Brooklyn whine of Al D'Amato from New York, the basso profundo
of Kit Bond from Missouri, the chainsaw howl of Phil Gramm of Texas and the
unctuous tones of Robert Bennett from Utah, one-time exculpator of
Watergate.
The sad fact was Ms Hanson was also abandoned by Democrats - not just every
Democrat but the two women on the committee who might have been expected to
have offered her at least a degree of protection and sympathy.
Barbara Boxer of California seemed to have clenched only one thing between
her perfect white teeth. Regardless of whatever Ms Hanson responded, she
found it incredulous that anybody in the administration should ever have
been motivated by fear of press leaks: and this in a town where colanders
have five-feet-wide holes to accommodate documents.
Nor could Senator Boxer understand - or consider even remotely defensible -
Ms Hanson's remarkably frank admission that she might have erred when Mr
Altman was testifying to the committee on February 24 in not leaping up to
advise him that he had not disclosed the full details about contacts between
the treasury and White House.
It was purely legalistic, Senator Boxer insisted from hour one to hour six,
to argue that the record could subsequently be corrected, though in
Washington such amplifications are routine. When Ms Hanson tried to respond,
Ms Boxer talked over her, which, had she been in the Senate in 1991, she
never would have done to Anita Hill in the Clarence Thomas supreme court
nomination hearings.
Nor was Senator Carol Mosely-Braun from Illinois any help either. Her
questioning seemed to have only one purpose - not to elicit hard answers but
to extract from Ms Hanson an admission that, if she had to do it all over
again, she would have done it differently. Prepared testimony and hours of
careful, if sometimes laboured, answers were never referred to by the
senator.
The committee chairman, Mr Don Riegle of Michigan, simply let Ms Hanson have
it. But then he knows what it is like to be under the ethics gun, having
been reprimanded by Congress for accepting payments from another notorious
savings and loan operator. He is retiring this year in any case and thus
cannot have felt the impulsion displayed last week by congressman Henry
Gonzalez, who gavelled the House counterpart committee into submission every
five minutes.
Even the stauncher Democrats, John Kerry of Massachussetts and Paul Sarbanes
of Maryland, fed off her flesh because she had not insisted on correcting Mr
Altman's testimony. They sensed, perhaps, that no one in this administration
would come to her rescue.
With friends like these, there was nothing the Republicans needed to do to
harm Ms Hanson, who was never their prime target anyway. Had she broken down
and implicated Mr Altman they would have packed up, gone home to dinner and
prepared for the morrow. But she only allowed that her 'recollections' of
certain meetings differed from those of her immediate superior and a few
minutes before midnight even apologised for being 'argumentative'.
It was not, by any standards, an edifying experience. But as a window on the
way Washington can work it was perversely instructive. If bright lawyers all
over America were watching, 99 out of 100 must have concluded that
government service was strictly for the birds, especially when this sort of
grief comes with an 80 per cent salary cut.

FT  03 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Ships deal fuels rivalry - Effects on
Japan and S Korea of world shipbuilding accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO and JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent agreement by leading shipbuilding nations to end government
subsidies and to allow for anti-dumping duties has added a new element to
the rivalry between the two largest shipbuilding countries, Japan and South
Korea.
The agreed ban on government subsidies to shipyards promises to strengthen
the global market share of both the Japanese and South Korean shipbuilding
industries - neither of which receives direct subsidies - by undermining the
competitive advantage enjoyed by their European rivals.
But the introduction of anti-dumping duties - tariffs designed to compensate
for what are regarded as artificially low export prices - on ships could
pose problems for Japan and South Korea, which have frequently resorted to
price cuts to win new orders. The two countries build about 70 per cent of
the world's ships.
Last year, for the first time, South Korea had more orders than Japan with
40 per cent of worldwide orders against Japan's 32 per cent. In the first
six months of this year, however, Japan has again risen to the top with
4.95m gross tonnes in orders against 1.9m gross tonnes for Korea, according
to the Shipbuilders' Association of Japan.
'There is a widespread belief in the South Korean shipbuilding industry that
Japan has gained the new orders by quoting below-cost prices,' said Mr D J
Yook, shipbuilding analyst for W I Carr in Seoul.
Japan's pricing is designed to compensate for the competitive advantage
enjoyed by South Korea whose production costs are 25 per cent lower.
Labour costs in Korea are half those of Japan and Korean prices for steel,
which account for half of raw material costs for ships, are 20 per cent
cheaper. In addition, the sharp appreciation of the yen's value against the
US dollar has further raised the relative costs of Japanese shipbuilders.
The measures to end 'injurious pricing' by 1996 could benefit Korea in the
short-term by forcing Japan to raise its prices.
But Korean shipbuilders may also be subject to anti-dumping suits if they
cut prices to fill the order books of their expanding network of shipyards.
'Korea is committed to becoming the world's largest shipbuilding nation and
I believe the Koreans are willing to risk dumping suits by offering low
prices if it means full dockyards,' said Mr Yook.
Korea decided at the end of last year to lift a government ban on increased
shipbuilding capacity, which is expected to rise by 3m tonnes in the next
few years.
The Korean Maritime Institute recently estimated that the country's
shipbuilding capacity was likely to surpass that of Japan by 2000, with an
annual production of at least 8.5m tonnes against 8m tonnes for Japan.
The expansion has triggered an outcry among other shipbuilding nations
concerned that it will cause a supply glut and depress prices.
'There is no need for increasing capacity,' protested Mr Shigeru Gohda,
chairman of the Shipbuilders' Association of Japan and of Sumitomo Heavy
Industries. 'If the Koreans increase their capacity as much as reported,
that would increase world capacity by 10 per cent. That would lead to
another recession in the industry.'
Korean shipbuilders justify the move by arguing that the government
restriction on shipyard expansion had prevented them from accepting new
orders last year. And, they say, the new capacity will lower production
costs since shipbuilding benefits from economies of scale.
Whether Korea's low prices are the result of improved efficiency or dumping,
the new anti-dumping measures 'give the EU and other countries the chance to
harass Korean shipbuilders by suing them', said Mr Lee Keunmo, an analyst at
Baring Securities in Seoul.
Meanwhile, ship owners are delaying new orders in the expectation of lower
prices.
So far, Japanese shipbuilders have stood up moderately well to the Korean
challenge. They have the advantage that the quality of their vessels has a
superior reputation.
Japanese productivity is also higher than in Korea, according to Mr Bruce
Roscoe, vice president of the investment research department at Goldman
Sachs in Tokyo.
But time is running out for the Japanese industry. The real threat for the
Japanese is not so much greater capacity in Korea, but how soon the Koreans
catch up in productivity, Mr Roscoe added.
To meet that challenge, Japanese shipbuilders are moving to reduce costs by
increasing foreign procurement, including buying steel from Korea, and
raising productivity further.
'This is the third major challenge we have faced since the war,' said Mr
Gohda. He is counting on the ability of the Japanese shipbuilding industry
to repeat the restructuring it went through during the oil shock of the
1970s and the yen appreciation of the mid-1980s.

FT  03 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Japan leans towards Boeing for developing
100-seat jet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Japan has indicated its preference for developing a 100-seat commercial jet
aircraft, in co-operation with Boeing of the US, rather than a joint
development with European companies for a 75-seater turbo-propellor
aircraft.
The move by Japanese aerospace manufacturers is a blow to European
aircraft-makers and is likely to fuel dissatisfaction in the EU over Japan's
inclination towards the US in aerospace. The move did not surprise the
industry in view of Japan's traditional links with Boeing.
Last week, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Japan's largest aerospace
manufacturer, informed ATR, the Franco-Italian regional turbo-propeller
aircraft-maker, and Saab-Scania of Sweden, that the Japanese consortium
developing the aircraft was 'moving in the direction of' choosing the
100-seat jet aircraft.
The proposed aircraft, code-named the YSX, is to be developed by leading
Japanese aircraft-makers under the auspices of the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry. The project is receiving Y1.1bn (Dollars 11m) in
government subsidies this year for a feasibility study and aims to deliver
the first aircraft in 2000.
The YSX represents Japan's latest effort to establish a foothold in the
international aerospace industry. The YSX consortium has been considering
whether to build a 75-seater aircraft with European manufacturers or a
100-seater with Boeing and a Chinese government agency.
Miti says that the feasibility study with the Europeans will go on, with a
final decision expected next year, and left open the option of co-developing
a 75-seater with European companies. However, Mitsubishi indicated that the
move to focus on a 100-seat jet aircraft reflected stronger potential.
For Boeing, the project would enable the US company to develop a smaller
version of its 737 twin-jet aircraft, of 75 to 100 seats, so as to respond
to potential demand of around 3,500 units over the next 15-20 years.
Boeing and the Japanese aircraft industry are targeting growing demand for
smaller jet aircraft in the fast-growing Asian markets.

FT  03 AUG 94 / World Trade News: EU seeks means to ratify Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union is drawing up a 'code of conduct' on trade negotiations
which it hopes will enable it to ratify April's General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (Gatt) accord, officials said yesterday.
The code would determine which EU institutions take the lead in new,
non-trade areas to be co-ordinated by Gatt's successor body, the World Trade
Organisation. The WTO is due to be established on January 1 next year.
These include exchange rates, market access for services, intellectual
property rights, anti-trust and social policies, and the environment.
Ratification of the Gatt agreement has been on hold for months, pending a
European Court of Justice decision on whether member states or the European
Commission has legal responsibility for conducting negotiations and entering
international agreements in the WTO.
The code of conduct would avoid the problem by imposing community discipline
on the member states, regardless of where the legal responsibility lay.
Under the draft code, the commission would have authority to negotiate only
in areas where they EU members have an agreed position.
However, the commission must agree to drop the court case before the code of
conduct can be adopted.
The code of conduct solution is being pushed by Germany, which holds the
six-month rotating presidency of the EU. A series of meetings has been
scheduled in September to try to refine the code.
Pressure has risen since it became clear that the court was unlikely to rule
on the matter until the end of this year, which would mean that the EU would
miss the January 1 deadline for setting up the WTO.
Under EU rules, the commission is authorised to negotiate trade pacts with
non-EU countries or blocs. The rules do not, however, deal with other types
of international economic negotiations or accords.
There is some doubt as to whether the code of conduct will succeed in
resolving the dispute.
Belgium, in particular, is opposed, arguing that the code will not be
legally clear and that it would be better to wait for the court of justice
to make its pronouncements.
The commission is in favour, alongside Sir Leon Brittan, the trade
commissioner.

FT  03 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Nintendo loses US patents case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nintendo of America, the US arm of the Japanese video game manufacturer, has
been ordered by a US court to pay damages of Dollars 208m for patent
infringement.
The award, to Alpex Computer, a defunct technology company, follows a jury
trial in New York. The case was filed in 1986 after Alpex had declared
bankruptcy. The company subsequently ceased operations.
Alpex claimed that Nintendo violated its patent, which expired in May, for
technology that helps video game characters move and interact. Nintendo,
which has an estimated 80 per cent of the US market for home video games,
denied that it had used Alpex-patented technology.
'Nintendo considers the jury's damage award and its previous finding of
patent infringement to be preposterous and flat wrong,' said Mr Howard
Lincoln, chairman of Nintendo of America. 'It's going to be tossed out on
its ear.' He said the verdict would have no effect on Nintendo products
because the patent had expired.
Nintendo said it would ask the judge to overturn the jury decision and, if
necessary, file an appeal with the US Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit, which specialises in intellectual property rights cases.
Mr Lincoln asserted that the jury misunderstood the complex technical issues
raised during the four-week trial and was misled by 'inflammatory statements
of Alpex counsel'.
The jury did not find 'wilful' infringement by Nintendo of Japan but ruled
that the US subsidiary had deliberately violated Alpex patent rights.
Nintendo, however, charged that the 'irrational verdict against a Japanese
company and its US subsidiary, together with a damage award which literally
defies belief . . .lends substance to foreign distrust of the American legal
system'.
Alpex, which had sought Dollars 413m in damages, will ask the court to
increase the award, said Mr John Strauch, a lawyer for the company. He said
the verdict would send a message to large companies that 'where there's a
valuable piece of intellectual property held, you cannot ignore it even
though it may be held by a small economically strapped company.
'We are pleased that, after eight years of hard-fought litigation, we were
able to achieve a substantial award for Alpex's shareholders and creditors.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US new home sales fell 14.1 per cent in June as the Federal Reserve's four
rises in short-term interest rates this year slowed the industry, Reuter
reports from Washington.
New home sales fell to a seasonally adjusted 591,000 annual units in June,
much lower than the 706,000 expected.
'It was a very weak report and indicates strongly that the higher interest
rates are taking their toll on the housing
industry,' said Ms Marilyn Schaja, money market economist at Donaldson
Lufkin and Jenrette Securities.
The US commerce department said the 591,000 level in June home sales was the
lowest since the 584,000 units of June 1992. It also said the levels in the
south and the north-east were the lowest since August 1992, and in the west
sales were at their lowest level in a year.
Sales of new single-family homes were revised lower in May to show 688,000
seasonally adjusted annual units, down from a previously reported 738,000.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Senate Republicans prepared a fresh attempt yesterday to limit President
Bill Clinton's authority to invade Haiti, as the US administration continued
to lay the groundwork for military action.
Mr Bob Dole, Senate minority leader, planned to introduce legislation with
other Republicans yesterday afternoon. It would urge Mr Clinton to consult
Congress before invading Haiti.
The move came after the US had secured the Dominican Republic's approval on
Monday for international surveillance of its border with Haiti, in an effort
to stop fuel smuggling. Despite the embargo and an international fleet
virtually blockading Haiti's coast, petrol has continued to flow to Haiti's
military.
The accord between the US and Dominican governments allows for about 100 UN
observers, half drawn from the US, to patrol the border in six US Huey
helicopters, under the US Atlantic Command.
'The operation itself, which is checking the borders and stopping smugglers,
will be done by Dominican Republic soldiers and police,' Mr William Perry,
US defence secretary, said yesterday. The US would supply the Dominicans
with helicopters, boats, night vision goggles and other equipment.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Economy faces severe test as turmoil grows: Daily oil output
is down at least 20% and Nigeria's debt arrears have risen to Dollars 7bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The month-long strike in Nigeria's oil industry threatens the vital source
of revenue which until now has saved the national economy from collapse.
Although foreign exchange restrictions since January have sharply depressed
the non-oil sector, oil production has remained strong this year, near an
all-time peak of 2m barrels a day. This provides more than 90 per cent of
Nigeria's exports and over 81 per cent of forecast government revenue.
This mainstay of the economy is at risk from the political crisis leading up
to today's general strike.
The anti-government action by the oil workers' unions has already cut daily
production by at least 20 per cent.
Nigeria's 1994 budget was
based on oil production of 1.9m b/d and an average price of Dollars 14 a
barrel. Around 300,000 b/d is for domestic refineries, and the rest is
exported. Net oil revenue, after the operators' share of the oil and the
government's share of operating costs, is just below Dollars 4bn a year,
which is less than Nigeria's total debt service obligations.
There has been no loss to the government in oil revenue during the first
month of the strike as the cut in output has been offset by the sharp jump
in the price of oil as traders speculated on fall in supply of Nigeria's
high quality light crude oil.
If production falls below 1.5m bpd at the current price of Dollars 19 a
barrel however, oil export revenue would end up below the budget forecast.
The oil companies say production losses are likely to increase if the strike
lasts.
The multinationals which operate Nigeria's production and exploration joint
ventures - 60 per cent owned by the government - are however reticent in
talking about the detailed effects of the strike. The security of their
staff, their revenue and their relationship with the government are at
stake.
So far only Anlo-Dutch Shell, the largest operator in Nigeria, has declared
that some of its installations have been closed with a loss of at least
400,000 barrels a day.
Shell in partnership with the state owned Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation, normally produces about 1m barrels of oil per day, half of
Nigeria' oil. Its operations are the most exposed to attack. Nearly all its
fields are onshore and are too many to fully protect.
Threats of violence and sabotage are taken seriously and the company
declined the government's offer of increased armed security forces to help
maintain operations.
The crisis in the oil industry has come at a time when the country is
externally insolvent. Payment arrears on Nigeria's Dollars 28bn external
debt stood at Dollars 7bn by April this year, the government's deficit looks
set to reach last year's level of 12 per cent of GDP, whilst state
regulation of financial markets by an unstable military regime has stopped
access to international aid and debt relief.
For 1994 Nigeria's government assumed debt relief which it has no prospect
of securing, allowing for debt service payments of Dollars 1.8bn, whilst its
obligations are Dollars 4.4bn, according to the finance ministry.
So far the Paris Club of official creditors, who are owed more than half the
debt, have received no payments.
Nigeria stopped servicing its debt to the Paris Club in early 1992 and there
is no prospect of debt relief since talks with the IMF broke down last year.
The government forecast a balanced budget for 1994. Economists say that the
official figure of a Dollars 1.3bn deficit by the end of May is probably an
under-estimate. They estimate that the flow of non-oil revenue into Nigeria
has almost dried up since the budget in January. Non-oil exports, for
example, fell from Dollars 16m in January to Dollars 5m in March.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Egypt's education minister has come under intense fire from Islamic
conservatives and roused the country's religious authorities because of a
decree aimed at limiting wearing of the veil among schoolgirls, Mark
Nicholson reports from Cairo.
Mr Hussein Kamel Bahaeddin issued a ruling last week that girls could wear
the hair-covering veil, the mark of female Islamic piety, only if they
presented a letter of permission from their parents. He said the move was to
prevent 'extremist' teachers from imposing the wearing of the veil, or
'hejab'. He cited cases of girls being 'badly beaten' by teachers for not
covering their hair.
Mr Bahaeddin's action appeared to be part of a government campaign to
counter what it fears to be the growing influence of radical Islam in
Egypt's classrooms, within a wider attempt to limit the appeal and spread of
Islamic militancy.

<TEXT>
Israeli and Jordanian officials met yesterday to finalise plans for a new
border crossing between the Red Sea towns of Eilat and Aqaba, which will
boost regional tourism and pave the way to new commercial and trade
relations, Julian Ozanne reports from Jerusalem.
The crossing is expected to be opened next week by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli
prime minister, King Hussein of Jordan and Mr Warren Christopher, US
secretary of state, who will be in the region to spur Israeli-Syrian peace
talks.
Israeli officials said the two sides were trying to finalise customs,
traffic, immigration and border formalities for third-country tourists
travelling between Israel and Jordan. Israel was also making a makeshift
road along the northern shores of the Gulf of Aqaba where the border
terminal will be built in place of coils of razor wire, sandbags and
military watch towers.
Opening the Aqaba-Eilat border will be the first concrete step to normalise
relations following the Washington declaration signed by King Hussein and Mr
Rabin last month. At present, foreign passport holders may cross into Jordan
via the Allenby Bridge but only with special permits and if their passports
do not have Israeli stamps.
Israeli officials said the first telephone links between the two countries
would be opened 'within days'. Bilateral talks on border demarcation, water,
security and environmental issues will also resume next Sunday on the
Israeli side of the Dead Sea as the two sides work towards a formal peace
treaty.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Eleven people were missing last night, following an explosion at the Porgera
goldmine in Papua New Guinea's remote Enga Province, Nikki Tait reports from
Sydney.
The mine, one of the world's largest, is owned jointly by Renison
Goldfields, in which Britain's Hanson group holds a large minority stake;
Highlands Gold, controlled by Queensland's MIM; Placer Pacific, which is
part of Canada's Placer Dome and also manages the mine; and the Papua New
Guinea government.
Five of those missing were said to be Australians, and others Papua New
Guinea nationals.
The Porgera partners said the explosion had resulted in a fire in the
storage area which was being brought under control. The cause of the blast,
they added, was not yet determined. All mining and milling operations were
suspended yesterday.
The mine produced 1.46m ounces of gold in 1992. But like many mining
projects in PNG, Porgera has been controversial, partly because of vigorous
local compensation demands, and partly because its higher-than-expected
output levels prompted the PNG government to demand a bigger share of the
project.

FT  03 AUG 94 / UN shifts Rwanda aid focus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS and LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The United Nations is planning a big shift in its humanitarian aid programme
for Rwanda, from coping with 'immediate life-saving needs' - principally
among the 1.2m refugees around the Zairean town of Goma - to creating the
conditions for refugees to return home, Frances Williams and Leslie Crawford
report.
Addressing donor governments in Geneva at a meeting to pledge contributions
to the UN's Dollars 434m Rwandan appeal, Mr Peter Hansen, head of the UN's
humanitarian affairs department, said the Rwandan Patriotic Front government
appeared committed to bringing Rwandans back and rebuilding the country.
One element of the UN programme would be confidence-building, including
deployment of international human rights monitors, to give returning
refugees a sense of security. Another would be action to make sure there is
no huge exodus of the 1.5m-2m displaced people now in the French-controlled
humanitarian protection zone in south-west Rwanda. The 2,500 French troops
are due to leave by late August.
In Kigali, an advance party of British soldiers arrived to take part in the
international relief effort. The 600-strong mission, codenamed Operation
Gabriel, is the largest deployment of British troops in Africa since they
oversaw Zimbabwe's first multi-racial elections 14 years ago.
Medical staff hope to prevent the spread of cholera and dysentry in Rwanda
by screening and treating returning refugees in Ruhengeri, close to the
Zaire border. Engineers will be based in the northern town of Byumba to help
rebuild bridges and repair roads damaged during Rwanda's civil war.

<TEXT>
A 'potentially severe and long-lasting' impact of the HIV/Aids epidemic on
Asian economies poses a serious threat to the region's robust growth,
according to studies by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Jose Galang writes
from Manila.  Mr Peter Sullivan, vice-president for operations at the
Manila-based ADB, said yesterday the HIV epidemic was the enemy of the
'Asian promise'. He addressed the opening of an ADB-sponsored meeting on the
economic implications of the disease.
The World Health Organisation, it was noted, has forecast that by the year
2000 some 30 per cent of cases worldwide may be in Asia. Mr Myo Thant, an
ADB economist, noted that since the first reports of Aids cases in the
region in the mid-1980s, the number of HIV infections had soared to 1m by
1991. He attributed the spread of the epidemic to 'a large commercial sex
industry and intravenous drug use' in the region.
'Rapid population growth, increasing mass migration of labour within the
region, and a growing international and intra-Asian tourist industry, all
facilitate the spread of the virus to those countries that are relatively
less affected at present,' he said.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Bank refuses Dollars 750m power loans to India: States are
failing to make hard financial decisions

The World Bank has turned down applications for power loans worth Dollars
750m (Pounds 490m) for projects in some Indian states because of
mismanagement in their government electricity boards.
The bank's loans to central government power projects remain unaffected.
The southern Indian state of Karnataka, which suffers acute power shortages,
will be worst affected by the World Bank's decision.
Mr Veerappa Moily, the state's chief minister, failed to convince senior
management of the bank in Washington that it should lend the state the
Dollars 250m-Dollars 300m it had asked for.
Mr Heinz Vergin, the World Bank's director in charge of India, said that
they had 'every intention to restart a relationship with Karnataka',
provided the state institution in charge of power generation and
distribution became financially viable.
Mr Vergin made his comments when announcing approval of Dollars 168m of
World Bank loans to help India tackle pollution in key industries.
World Bank officials have repeatedly expressed their concern about
mismanagement in state electricity boards.
Many of these boards have gone bankrupt because they have failed to collect
dues, have provided electricity at prices lower than cost, and have ignored
large-scale electricity thefts.
The bank, in its annual country report released in May, urged the need for
restructuring the power sector in the states.
Several large power projects, like Enron US's 2015MW project in Dhabol,
Maharashtra, have yet to reach the implementation stage because they have
found it financially unviable to deal with crisis-ridden state electricity
boards.
The government, which liberalised the power sector two years ago, has
received nearly 75 proposals, amounting to Rs20bn (Pounds 414m), for more
than 32,000MW of generation capacity, half India's existing installed
capacity.
International investors have been asking the central government for
counter-guarantees, which the government has so far been unable to provide,
because the state governments are unwilling to take the hard political
decisions needed to make their electricity boards viable.
The World Bank has recommended the Indian government extend its reform
process to the states.
Mr NK Salve, India's power minister, said the bank's decision had not come
as a surprise to the ministry, which now has a stronger case to urge that
state electricity boards improve their finances.
But he added that central government could not let down the states, and his
ministry was aware of the responsibility to them, especially when most were
facing a 'dangerously suicidal situation' on the power front.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Parties plan Delhi boycott
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Indian opposition parties said yesterday they would boycott the present
parliamentary session in protest at the government's handling of the 1992
Bombay securities scandal.
Mr Narasimha Rao's Congress (I) party and the opposition are in dispute over
the government's 'Action Taken Report' on the scandal inquiry. Opposition
groups allege Mr Rao used the report to shield senior ministers from
criticism by a joint parliamentary committee.
Opposition leaders said they had taken the decision with 'reluctant and
heavy hearts', but were responding to the government's 'negative attitude'
to what they termed a 'sabotage of parliament'. The present session ends in
the last week of this month.
The government yesterday offered to table a supplementary report, making the
offending 'Action Taken' report an interim one. But opposition leaders who
had earlier suggested this move said it was 'too late' to accept it now.
The joint parliamentary committee submitted its report on the Bombay stock
scandal after 18 months of much-publicised deliberations. The report held Mr
Manmohan Singh, India's finance minister, responsible for the scandal, and
implicated several other ministers, bureaucrats and foreign and domestic
banks in its report.
The government said a 'systems failure' it had inherited, not created, had
been responsible. Mr Singh was staunchly defended, and the only tangible
action taken by the government was a decision by the Reserve Bank, India's
central bank, to penalise 35 foreign and domestic banks said to have been
involved.
The walk-out by the entire Opposition, except two small groups which support
Congress (I), and their further decision to resign from parliamentary
committees will cripple most proceedings.

<TEXT>
Japan is unlikely to meet its official target for cutting carbon dioxide
emissions, set under a UN treaty which aims to tackle global warming.
In a report to be submitted to the UN next month Japan's environmental
agency forecasts that carbon dioxide emissions will rise to an annual 330m
tonnes by the year 2000, a 3.1 per cent rise from 1990.
Japan had agreed at the UN Earth Summit in Brazil in 1992, to cut greenhouse
gas emissions back to 1990 levels by the year 2000.
Some industrialised countries, including Germany and Denmark, are now
calling for stricter targets, requiring governments to reduce emissions
rather than simply stabilising them.
The Japanese agency had initially tried to include a carbon dioxide emission
tax in its environmental protection bill approved last year, but was forced
to remove the clause following pressure from business and the government's
own ministry of international trade and industry.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Reality threatens to overcome China-Taiwan rivalry / Preview
of talks between Beijing and Taipei that may for the first time address the
issue of direct sea and air links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Village chief Huang, who has spent most of his 64 years fishing out of
Nanliao, a small port on the north-west coast of Taiwan, is angry. Since the
government cracked down on a brisk trade in smuggling goods between the
island and China a few years ago, local fishermen are having a tough time
making ends meet.
'The government should just legalise direct shipping with China and make
those smugglers pay tax, like they do on the mainland side,' complains Mr
Huang. 'That's a much better way to manage things. Instead, they send the
fishermen to jail, burn their boats and the police confiscate the goods for
themselves. This is totally unreasonable. Besides, it isn't really smuggling
anyway; it's domestic trade.'
Even as Mr Huang was speaking, officials from rival governments in Taipei
and Beijing were preparing to hold high-level talks in which, Taiwanese
newspapers have suggested, Taipei may for the first time address the issue
of resuming direct sea and air links to China.
Taiwan's Nationalist government has banned the san tung or 'three directs' -
transportation, trade and post - with China since 1949, when General Chiang
Kai-shek fled to the island after losing a civil war to Mao Zedong's
communist forces.
Fast-growing cross-strait trade is mostly funneled through Hong Kong. But
smuggling and illegal fishing in the Taiwan Strait surged once the
government lifted martial law and began to relax coastal defence operations
in 1987.
Positioned at the narrowest point along the strait, Nanliao became a
smuggling hub. To traverse the 70-odd nautical miles to Pingtan on the coast
of China's Fujian province takes 10 hours by fishing boat, three to four
hours by cruiser, or less than two hours by speedboat.
Lured by high returns, local fishermen plied the waters in wooden boats
laden with contraband ranging from liquor, cigarettes and medicines, to
narcotics from betel to heroin and human cargo which has found its way to
shores as far-flung as New York. Judging by the number of Mercedes-Benzes
and BMWs on the sleepy byways of Nanliao, some locals profited handsomely
before Taiwan's maritime police swooped on Nanliao.
Cross-strait smuggling has simply been diverted elsewhere, mainly along
Taiwan's northern coast. An estimated 200 fishing boats make the crossing
each day. Smuggled Chinese products can be found in markets and 30,000
mainlanders are illegally living on the island.
From tomorrow, Taiwan's chief China negotiator, Mr Chiao Jen-ho, will begin
four days of talks with his counterpart from Beijing, Mr Tang Shubei. Little
progress has been made in five previous quasi-official cross-strait
discussions since ground-breaking meetings in April 1993. But the stalemate
in political relations belies resurgent economic ties, driven by cultural
and family connections as well as the search by Taiwan businessmen for cheap
labour, land, raw materials and markets. Taiwanese investment in China is
estimated at more than Dollars 15bn (Pounds 9.6bn).
Taiwan officials predict that Hong Kong, the main conduit, will soon
supplant the US as the island's biggest export market. In the first half of
this year, shipments to the US accounted for 25.9 per cent of total exports,
down 1.8 per cent from a year earlier. Exports to the British colony jumped
11.2 per cent to account for 22.9 per cent of outbound shipments. Most
shipments headed for Hong Kong are destined for China.
A leading Chinese businessman visited the island last week under the guise
of promoting cross-strait golfing exchanges. Mr Wang Jun, president of the
China International Trust and Investment Corp (Citic), China's leading
international business conglomerate, met with senior figures in politics and
business.
Mr Wang's low-profile tour of the island included a trip to Taichung
harbour, which is preparing for the advent of cross-strait shipping. It is
perhaps no coincidence that Citic and Bechtel Enterprises, the finance and
development arm of the engineering group, last week jointly announced a port
development plan at Daxie Island, about 100 miles south of Shanghai.
So far, Taipei has refused to discuss direct links on the grounds that
Beijing must first recognise Taiwan as a sovereign government. China
continues to regard Taiwan as a renegade province. But as economic ties
between the two sides grow, so too does pressure from Taiwan's business
community, making it increasingly difficult for Taipei to stave off the
inevitable.
The ministry of transportation and communications promised early last month
to produce a report by mid-1995 outlining technical aspects of direct sea
and air links with China. This is probably little more than a stalling
technique, as the ministry has already been studying the matter for years.
But the government knows it must come to grips with the issue before June 30
1997, when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty, for then there can be
no more pretence of keeping China at arm's length.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A Nigerian court trying presidential claimant Moshood Abiola for treason in
Abuja adjourned until today, when a nationwide general strike is due to
start if he is not freed, Reuter reports from Abuja.
The embattled military government yesterday appealed to workers not to join
the general strike, saying that a meeting was scheduled with the umbrella
Nigeria Labour Congress tomorrow to discuss workers' grievances.
The NLC has directed all its 3.5m members to begin a strike from today if Mr
Abiola is not released. Mr Abiola, who is widely considered the winner of
last year's annulled presidential election, is on trial in Abuja for treason
for proclaiming himself president.
The case resumed yesterday but was adjourned when the prosecutor could not
reply to the defence motion to strike out the case and discharge him Oil
unions, which are on strike in an attempt to end military rule and secure Mr
Abiola's release, said the adjournment would not help matters.
There was strong speculation that a meeting between General Sani Abacha, the
military ruler, and leaders of the armed forces on Monday had decided to
free Mr Abiola unconditionally to ease tension. It had been suggested all
charges would be dropped during yesterday's court hearing.
Mr Abiola's lawyers argued that the Abuja court had no jurisdiction to try
an offence allegedly committed in Lagos.
Mr Abiola told the judge he was still being denied access to newspapers and
radio. 'They lock me up unless I have a visitor. That is only when I am
allowed out,' he said.
The area around the court was under tight security and hundreds of people
were barred from entering.
Oil industry unions said that freeing Mr Abiola would not be enough to send
them back to work. 'He must be sworn in because he won the election,' said
Mr Wariebe Agamene, president of Nupeng, the blue-collar union.
'Release itself will not be enough. The aim is to restore democracy now,'
said Mr Bola Owodunni, president of Pengassan.
Ina joint statement, the two unions said: 'We wish to stress categorically
that we remain unimpressed by the play of the government to reduce our
demands to the simplistic one of the release of Abiola and other political
detainees.'
The unions 'insist on the immediate withdrawal of the military from politics
and the handing over of government to the democratically elected president'.
Their strike has paralysed the nation by disrupting fuel deliveries. Banks
and most other businesses have shut as a result.
Further disruption is certain to result if the Nigeria Labour Congress joins
the strike as hospitals, power and water will be affected.
Meanwhile, the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria said it had
advised the government against using troops to back oil companies operating
under threat from striking oil unions.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Green light begins to flash for recyclable cars in Germany:
The environment industry is backing plans to make cars 85 per cent re-usable
by 2002.
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After years of debate, German carmakers and environmentalists are nearing a
showdown about how to recycle cars. The result is likely to have
implications across the European Union.
Since the late-1980s talks have often take place but have always stopped
short of solutions. Several carmakers have been working on models designed
to optimise recycling and increasingly cars are designed to include the
maximum number of recyclable items.
Following a recent meeting between the two sides - the environment ministry
on the one hand and the car industry and economics ministry on the other -
carmakers are hard at work. By the end of 1995 they hope to have created a
network of dealers which will recover the approximately 2.5m cars taken out
of service in Germany every year. The dealers will take them apart and sell
the parts or pass them on to the carmakers which have agreed to make use of
what is left over.
The industry is under considerable pressure to come up with a solution:
waste sites are filling up and Mr Klaus Topfer, the environment minister, is
eager to extend the ambit of his Kreislaufwirtschaft, a set of laws designed
to create an economy where virtually everything can be re-used.
Many cars are already up to 75 per cent recyclable and BMW, for instance,
prides itself on its new 7 series BMW which is 85 per cent re-usable. What
is missing is a nationwide system to collect and process the cars.
The 15 associations which belong to the motor industry, including companies
making steel, glass and plastic, are now drawing up plans to create such a
system where recycling sites will be no further than 80km away from each
other.
By 2002 all cars are to be 85 per cent recyclable and by 2015 only 5 per
cent of the car's weight will be left on rubbish dumps, according to a plan
submitted by the carmakers' association.
BMW is working with the environmental services subsidiaries of Thyssen,
Preussag and Klockner to build a nationwide network of recyclers - similar
to a dealer chain - which would take over the cars and, most importantly,
break them up according to accepted environmental standards.
There is an abundance of horror stories about how cars are disposed of.
Sometimes the petrol tank is filled with engine oils and, on other
occasions, the car boot is piled high with used tyres. These are just two
examples where people have delivered their cars for recycling and thrown in
other waste for good measure, says Mr Wilhelm Kallweit, of Thyssen
Sonnenberg, the Thyssen subsidiary which specialises in environmental
technology.
Under the new regulations the petrol, oils, brake fluid and coolant will be
collected in separate containers which are taken away by specialist
companies.
Tyres, batteries and glass are already removed when cars are recycled but in
future safety belts, bumpers and door pockets will also be taken back by the
carmakers. These are working on technology which would allow them to re-use
bumpers as the lining for car boots and door pockets as the ledges under the
rear windscreen. Companies such as BMW will also supply computer software
which can identify exactly what materials were used to build a 1960 model,
enabling recyclers to sort left-overs more efficiently.
Engineers are also working on thermal technology which could break down
other compounds found in cars. But at the moment a residue - 15 per cent in
the case of the new 7 series BMW - is left over. 'The rest simply ends on
waste collection sites,' says Mr Wilhelm Pottinger, who heads the recycling
unit at BMW.
Much remains to be done. Thyssen Sonnenberg is for the first time working on
a model to identify exactly how much time is needed to take a car apart.
Previously costs have been impossible to calculate because there were no
environmental standards to speak of and the job was done in such a haphazard
manner.
The biggest bone of contention is the price. The motor industry wants the
car's last owner to pay the estimated DM200 (Pounds 82.60) it will cost to
break down the car and dispose of its parts. Competition among recyclers
would keep the costs down and a possible rebate for drivers would encourage
them to keep their cars in the best possible condition, says Mr Alfred
Brode, a spokesman for BMW.
The environment ministry, however, is not convinced and is pushing for a
higher new car price which would reflect the recycling costs. 'We want to
force the carmakers to think more about how they can use more of the car for
recycling purposes,' says Mr Martin Waldhausen, a spokesman for the
environment ministry.
While industry is working to improve recycling capabilities, companies
believe they will not be able to do it all themselves. 'The government must
force people to recycle their cars,' says Mr Brode, referring to proposals
which would require people to prove that they have taken their car to a
licensed recycler before they can cancel their registration.
The German plans are being extended across Europe. BMW signed an agreement
with Renault and Fiat in April which obliges all three companies to take and
recycle their partners' cars abroad.
However, Mr Waldhausen is not optimistic that industry will make enough
progress before early next year. 'There have been a lot of fine words but
little of it is actual substance.'
As car prices are politically sensitive and elections are looming, the
environment ministry has said it will wait until early next year to see if
the carmakers and the economics ministry can hammer out a workable scheme.
If too much remains just talk, the environment ministry has vowed to force
through laws to create a car recycling system.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Adverts attack Russian government over MMM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The fate of the Russian finance company MMM hung in the balance yesterday as
a group of people claiming to be simple shareholders took out full-page
newspaper advertisements attacking the government for destabilising their
company.
Under the headline 'Why we trust MMM and don't trust the bureaucrats', the
advertisement - which can be taken as a statement on behalf of MMM, even if
routed through signatories - shows the same populist and ruthless sureness
of touch displayed by Mr Sergei Mavrodi, MMM's president, in creating the
huge financial group and promoting it through an unprecedented television
campaign.
It appeared as the finance ministry announced that it had invited Mr Mavrodi
to a meeting today when he will be expected to divulge how many shareholders
he has, show how he could pay such huge dividends on the shares, be told to
conduct an audit of the company and explain why he has neither paid the
taxes demanded of him nor produced documents long demanded by the ministry.
Mr Andrei Vavilov, deputy finance minister, told Interfax news agency that
the ministry remained 'loyal' to those companies dealing in shares  - but
required them to obey the rules.
The advertisement says that because of MMM hundreds of thousands of people
have lifted themselves out of poverty and tens of thousands have amassed
enough capital to go into business. Where the government merely talked about
founding a middle class, MMM had done so.
Noting that several senior government officials had called MMM a fraud and
its leaders gangsters, the signatories say: 'Can (the state) criticise, or
even bring administrative pressure to bear, not for what the company has
done but for what, in its view, it might do?'

An interim report into the crash in July of an Airbus A330 aircraft on its
test flight appears to point to human error as the cause. The official
report, published yesterday, says the crash of the twin-engined airliner, in
which seven people died, was not the result of mechanical failure. 'In the
first analysis, it appears that there was no failure of the aircraft, its
motors or its equipment which would have contributed to the accident,' the
report says. It recommends that Airbus bring to the attention of airlines
using the A330 the need to monitor aircraft speed when using the altitude
auto-pilot setting. Airbus said it had already implemented the
recommendations.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission has firmly rejected proposals by the German
government to hand responsibility for decisions on European cartel cases to
an independent body of experts. The proposal was put forward by Mr Gunther
Rexrodt, the German economics minister, as part of the programme for
Germany's six-month presidency of the European Union. But the Commission,
whose fourth directorate general is responsible for competition cases,
argues that an independent body would lack the political sensitivity
required to get the right balance between member states. The Germans would
like to see a European cartel office modelled on its own Bundeskartellamt.
Brussels fears that this could give too much power back to the member
states. Last year some 1,250 cases involving restrictive agreements and

A lawyer for Mr Maurice Arreckx, the Riviera senator detained on Monday on a
charge of soliciting a FFr1.5m (Pounds 180,000) bribe to award a public
contract, said yesterday his 76-year-old client had prostate cancer and
should not be confined to prison, adding that government ministers facing
more serious charges remained free. But Mr Arreckx's detention has been
approved by his fellow senators, who heeded the warning of the Toulon
investigating magistrate that, if left free during the inquiry, the veteran
politician might seek to intimidate witnesses or tamper with evidence. The
case against Mr Arreckx arose out of an investigation into corruption in the
Var, following the assassination there last spring of deputy Mrs Yann Piat.

<TEXT>
Romanian coal miners, whose violent demonstrations in the capital have
played a critical role in Romanian politics over the past five years,
threatened yesterday to march on Bucharest if their demands were not met.
Eighty thousand coal miners have been on strike since Thursday demanding
that their wages be pegged to inflation, and 24 miners have begun a hunger
strike. Mr Miron Cosma, a union leader, said that if any of the hunger
strikers died, he would lead 200,000 miners in a raid on the capital. He
also threatened to call a general strike. Thirty thousand copper miners have
begun legal proceedings to join the strike. Negotiations between the
government and the workers broke down over the weekend when the miners
rejected a 7 per cent pay increase.

<TEXT>
The German government is not doing enough to encourage part-time work, Ms
Ursula Engelen-Kefer, deputy head of the trade union federation (DGB), said
yesterday. Ms Engelen-Kefer said the current arrangements for part-time work
are not flexible enough, particularly for women with families. Last June
Chancellor Helmut Kohl supported a plan to privatise more of the state
sector, cut unemployment benefits after a certain period of time, and
introduce more part-time work as a means of cutting unemployment. But Ms
Engelen-Kefer said the legal basis for part-time work, including insurance,
health and pension schemes, was inadequate. Recent studies have shown that
more than 2.5m Germans would prefer to work part-time. About 15.5 per cent
of the labour force already works part-time, most of whom are women in
low-paid jobs.

US Vice-President Al Gore yesterday offered American support for launching

Gore is one of the first foreign leaders to visit Ukraine's new president,
Mr Leonid Kuchma, who is just two weeks in office. His emphasis on the
economy was a departure from previous high-level US visits, which have
focused on dismantling Ukraine's nuclear arsenal, and comes one week after
the head of the IMF met the president. Mr Gore said: 'A strong and
prosperous and independent Ukraine is a stabilising force for peace in
central Europe and throughout the entire region.' The US has offered Ukraine
Dollars 700m, making it the fourth largest recipient of American aid. Mr
Gore forwarded an invitation from President Bill Clinton to Mr Kuchma to
visit Washington on November 29. The Ukrainian leader accepted.

Serbia, facing the prospect of stiffer sanctions, threatened yesterday to
sever relations with the Bosnian Serbs if they continued to reject the
latest international peace plan. Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic told
the Bosnian Serb leaders that failure to accept the plan unconditionally
would amount to 'treason' and 'crimes against their own people'. Mr
Milosevic's strong message was praised by Russian and British officials.
Russia's special envoy to former Yugoslavia, Mr Vitaly Churkin, raised the
possibility that sanctions against Belgrade could be lifted if it broke with
the Bosnian Serbs.
Also yesterday, Serb and Moslem forces clashed across Bosnia, and in the
north-western enclave of Bihac, forces loyal to the Moslem government
intensified their attack on a rebel Moslem faction.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Hungary warns of double-dip recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hungary's new Socialist government looks set to follow other east European
countries in which former communists have returned to power, as it abandons
populist rhetoric and prepares austerity measures more severe than its
nationalist predecessors could stomach.
Only a fortnight after entering office, Mr Laszlo Bekesi, Hungary's new
Socialist finance minister, yesterday warned of swingeing budget cuts and a
relapse into recession next year.
The finance ministry expects GDP growth of 1 per cent to 2 per cent this
year after a four-year depression in which Hungary's economy contracted by
more than 20 per cent.
But the famously gloomy Mr Bekesi used his first major policy statement as
finance minister to warn of another dip in economic activity, with output
sinking back by 1 per cent in 1995.
Just last month the Vienna Institute for Comparative Economic Studies
forecast that Hungary - once the communist bloc's economic pioneer - would
share in the recovery spreading from Poland to the other fast reformers of
eastern Europe.
Hungary's economic rebound has been hobbled, however, by a balance of
payments crisis. Hungary has the highest debt service per capita in the
region and the current account deficit hit Dollars 3.46bn (Pounds 2.23bn),
10 per cent of GDP, last year.
An International Monetary Fund delegation met the new Hungarian government
last week to warn that the imbalance was unsustainable.
The National Bank of Hungary took independent action by raising its key repo
interest rates by a total of four points in June and July. But that has
taken real borrowing rates towards 20 per cent and the central bank said
monetary policy alone cannot stabilise the economy.
The government last week cancelled the 1996 Budapest Expo to save money and
Mr Bekesi said yesterday he planned an emergency fiscal package in September
to reduce this year's budget deficit by Ft60bn (Pounds 383m), or 1.5 per
cent of GDP. The government is also embarking on negotiations with trade
unions and employers on a wide-ranging programme to claw back a recent surge
in real wages.
These measures and further cuts in the 1995 budget will take Hungary part of
the way towards the IMF target of halving the current account deficit to
Dollars 1.5bn in 1995.
The Socialists' austerity programme sits uneasily, however, with voters'
expectations in the May elections that the former communists would ease
economic hardship. It remains to be seen whether the realists, as Mr Bekesi
describes himself, have the political strength to overcome the trade union
wing of the party.
Commercial banks have built up large foreign exchange positions in the
expectation that the government will take the easier option of a devaluation
of up to 10 per cent.
Mr Bekesi refused yesterday to comment on the increasingly feverish
speculation against the forint. But he left the option of devaluation open
by talking of a 'balanced exchange rate policy' to 'anticipate rather than
follow changes in competitiveness'.

FT  03 AUG 94 / W German production picks up speed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
West German industrial output, the main motor of the federal economy, is
gaining momentum and order intake is rising sharply, according to data
published yesterday.
Production from western factories, mines and power plant rose 1 per cent
during June, the economics ministry said in a preliminary report. Adding a
rider that it expected this to be revised upwards to more than 1.5 per cent,
it noted that May's decline, originally put at 0.7 per cent, had been only
0.1 per cent.
Economists said if this pace were maintained, and orders continued to rise,
west Germany could see overall economic growth of more than 2 per cent this
year - matching government forecasts previously regarded as over-optimistic.
Although some voiced concern about the effect of the strong D-Mark on
exports and the still-evident lack of domestic demand for consumer goods,
most expected a recent rise in business confidence to be underpinned by
strong growth in industrial order data, due later this week.
An early indication of demand trends emerged yesterday when officials in
North Rhine-Westphalia, the region's manufacturing heartland, said orders
had risen 7 per cent in June, with domestic and export bookings both showing
the same rate of growth.
This indicated further hardening of a recently detectable increase in
support from the home market for a recovery which had hitherto been
predominantly export-led.
Although German industrial output figures tend to be volatile, the economics
ministry's comparison of aggregate data for May and June with the same
period of 1993 showed overall western industrial production up 3.2 per cent.
Manufacturing industry, excluding mining, energy and construction, stepped
up output by 3.5 per cent in the same period, with items such as components
and basic materials up more than 7 per cent.
The most significant negative result came from consumer goods, down 1.3 per
cent for the two-month period. The North Rhine-Westphalian order figures
suggested that falling real incomes are still depressing consumer-related
industries.
While foreign orders for consumer goods from the state's factories rose 6
per cent, domestic bookings fell 4 per cent during the month.
Apart from economists, several leading German companies, including the
Allianz insurance group and BMW, have recently suggested Germany's recovery
could be damaged if an over-valued D-Mark depressed exports.
However, latest data from the Bundesbank show that the
currency has appreciated against those of its most important European Union
trading partners by only 0.1 per cent since the start of the year.
It has risen 8.2 per cent against the dollar in the same period, but the US
accounts for only around 10 per cent of German exports.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Economic Watch: Italian inflation falls to 3.6%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's inflation has fallen to 3.6 per cent on an annualised basis, the
lowest level since September 1969. According to Istat, the state statistics
institute, prices in July rose 0.3 per cent compared to the previous month.
This is marginally higher than the preliminary figures from Italy's major
cities which showed last month's inflation was running at an annualised 3.5
per cent. The current annualised inflation rate is almost one percentage
point below that of this time last year. The government has projected
year-end inflation will be running at 3.5 per cent and will fall to 2.5 per
cent by the end of 1995. A crucial element in falling inflation has been the
containment of wage demands but the impact of the recession, at last behind
Italy, has also played a part. Robert Graham, Rome
Austria's unemployed as a percentage of the workforce was down 0.1 per cent
in July month-on-month but unchanged at 4.4 per cent from July 1993, the
Austrian social affairs ministry said yesterday.
Finland's unemployment rate showed a year-on-year fall in June to 17.9 per
cent from 18.1 per cent in June last year, the first such decline since
October 1990, Statistics Finland said.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Moscow backs rebel power bid in Chechnya
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The opposition forces in the Russian republic of Chechnya in the northern
Caucasus say they have taken over power and have received support in
principle from the Russian government.
However, eyewitness reports from Grozny, the Chechen capital, indicate that
General Dzhokar Dudayev, the Chechen president, appears to be still in
control.
The declaration of assumption of power by the 'provisional Council of
Chechnya' which controls the area of Nadterechnaya - apparently outside Gen
Dudayev's reach - was given immediate support by Mr Emil Pain, a member of
the Russian presidential council with responsibility for ethnic affairs. Mr
Pain said that the Provisional Council's session which declared its control
had included more than 2000 delegates from most parts of Chechnya, thus
indicating wide support.
Mr Pain called on all citizens of Chechnya, including the government, to
'make its choice' - leaving no doubt that the Russian government has made
its choice in favour of the Provisional Council.
However, the republic's press agency, Chechenpress, said that Mr Umar
Avturkhanov, the council's leader, had been accused of treason and that
warrants had been issued for his arrest.
An office worker in the presidential office told Reuters news agency that
everything was calm in the capital.
The council's statement said that Gen Dudayev had 'usurped authority' and
that all his decrees were invalid. The council would 'immediately begin
preparations for general democratic elections, form a government of national
revival and ensure the continuity of power pending the election of a
legislative body'. The council said the economy 'was on the brink of
disaster' and the Dudayev government had turned the republic 'into the main
base for organised crime in the North Caucasus'.
The aims of the government of national revival include the signing of a
treaty with Russia in order to normalise relations. For more than two years,
Russia and Chechnya have traded insults; the former, after an early abortive
effort to intervene militarily, has been content to play a waiting game
until internal opposition was strong enough to challenge President Dudayev.
Mr Avturkhanov appeared on Russian television last weekend to assure
Russians that Chechnya would be brought back within the constitutional fold
but that it should be done without an armed invasion by Russian troops.
The Russian press has also stepped up the campaign against Chechnya, with
some papers expected today to publish photographs of three headless corpses
alleged to be victims of Gen Dudayev's purges. According to a photographer
for the daily Sevodnya who saw the corpses, the three were handed over to
their 'blood enemies' by the Chechen KGB for private execution.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Eastern Germany's services sector, which expanded rapidly after unification,
is slowing because the industrial base is too small and not competitive
enough to allow the services sector to expand further, according to a report
issued by three economic institutes, writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin. The
report also warns that unless the high level of investments is maintained
and the federal government extends further sub-sidies to the privatised
sector, there is little chance that the east will 'catch up' with west
Germany. The DIW in Berlin, the Institute for Economic Research in Halle and
the Institute for World Economy in Kiel show that compared to the last
quarter of 1993, the gross value of the services sector, at 1991 prices,
declined in the first quarter of this year - by DM0.7bn to DM13.3bn. Over
the same period, eastern Germany's gross domestic product fell from DM56.1bn
to DM52.2bn. The value of manu-facturing output fell to DM10.3bn during the
first quarter of this year compared with DM11.9bn over the last three months
of 1993. It adds that high labour unit costs and an under-capitalised
privatised sector are hindering competitiveness. One area of consistent
growth is construction, which increased to DM8.9bn from DM8.6bn in the first
three months of 1994.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Heseltine 'excluded' Treasury from DTI reviews
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine ordered the exclusion of Treasury officials from
fundamental spending reviews at the Department of Trade and Industry. He
then prematurely wound up the exercise four months before it was due to be
completed.
The trade and industry secretary is understood to have said that the working
parties, which involved members of the DTI and Treasury officials, were
taking up 'too much time' and that he had his own ways of scrutinising
budgets.
Mr Heseltine's action in February throws further light on the friction
between him and Mr Michael Portillo, the new employment secretary, over the
public spending review.
Their differences came into the open earlier this week with the leaking of a
letter in which Mr Portillo, then chief secretary to the Treasury, upbraided
Mr Heseltine for failing to support policies to cut taxation and spending.
Mr Portillo pressed Mr Heseltine to accept drastic cuts in a large number of
DTI programmes and to end support for shipbuilding and an independent UK
space programme.
Civil servants said yesterday the tone of Mr Portillo's letter may have been
influenced by Mr Heseltine's premature winding up of the reviews and the
fact that he barred Treasury officials from the final meetings.
Government officials, however, also said they were not surprised by the
letter. 'The debate that has surfaced about what is the role of the DTI is
one that has gone on for a long time, and it has never been resolved,' said
one official. 'This time it has emerged in a sharpish form.'
The reviews were devised to examine what Whitehall departments should be
doing. The DTI review began late last year, with a number of working
parties.
Two months into the planned six-month review, Mr Heseltine said he wanted
the working groups to be wound up within 2 1/2 weeks and that Treasury
officials should be barred from attending their final deliberations. The
groups concluded their work without the Treasury being part of the process.
The Treasury said yesterday that it could not comment on actions by
officials in another department. The DTI also said it was unable to comment.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Railway dispute intensifies after Acas talks fail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's rail dispute worsened last night after the conciliation service
Acas failed to persuade Railtrack and the RMT transport union to return to
the negotiating table.
Both sides accused the other of intransigence as five days of exploratory
talks failed to break the deadlock in the signalling staff dispute.
The RMT executive announced it had called a further 24-hour strike for next
week, on Friday August 12, and a 48-hour stoppage on Monday and Tuesday,
August 15-16. The strikes will paralyse much of the rail network for five
days over a weekend in the peak holiday season.
These stoppages are in addition to today's 24-hour strike - the eighth in
the present dispute - which starts at noon and ends at midday tomorrow.
Railtrack said: 'This is the most disgraceful wrecking tactic we have seen
from a union for a long time. It is a vicious action designed to cause the
maximum disruption.'
Mr David Armstrong, Railtrack's human resources director, described as a
'sham' the union's claim that it was willing to negotiate freely. 'The RMT
has rejected every attempt to find a solution throughout the many weeks of
this dispute,' he said.
'They have not made a single concession. Their posturing of the last few
weeks has lost each of their members hundreds of pounds this summer and
thousands in the future.'
Railtrack hopes that many signalling staff will be horrified at what it sees
as RMT's intransigence and will ignore the strike calls. About a third of
the network is expected to run through today's strike.
The company may seek to ballot signal staff to find out whether they will
accept the current offer. Railtrack said the offer was a rise of 7.2 per
cent on earnings between April 4 and October 1. From October 1 a
restructuring package would increase basic rates by up to 26 per cent.
Overall, the offer would improve earnings by up to 10 per cent.
In the absence of RMT general secretary Jimmy Knapp, who is attending an
international union conference in Switzerland, Mr Vernon Hince, the union's
chief negotiator, accused Railtrack of a 'public relations exercise' in
offering signal staff in the south west payments of up to Pounds 800 to work
on strike days.
He repeated that the union claim for an interim rise for past efficiencies
had 'never been seriously addressed since June 8'. 'We are not going to sell
the members short,' he said.
British Rail said last night services would run for the first time from all
of London's main line stations during the 24-hour stoppage that starts at
noon today.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Bank warns of need for rate rise: Government told underlying
inflation may exceed 2.5% target in early 1996
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England yesterday warned that unless base rates are increased in
the next few months the government could fail to meet its target of reducing
underlying inflation to a 1-2.5 per cent range by the end of this
parliament.
In its quarterly inflation report, published yesterday, the Bank forecast
that underlying retail price inflation, which excludes mortgage interest
payments, would peak at over 3 per cent in the first quarter of 1996.
The Bank, however, clearly signalled that there would be no rise in base
rates, currently 5.25 per cent, before September 7 when its governor, Mr
Eddie George, next meets Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer.
The report acknowledged that inflation had been lower than the Bank had
previously forecast and it also reduced the Bank's short-term outlook for
underlying inflation.
Speculation about an imminent base rate increase reached a peak last Friday,
when the Bank accepted bids for Treasury bills at rates of up to 5.75 per
cent. Yesterday, however, the money markets were relieved by the tone of the
report.
Short sterling, the futures market's means of speculating on interest rate
changes, rose on the news, indicating a decline in expectations of an
interest rate rise. The three-month interbank offered rate fell back to 5
9/16 per cent, from 5 3/4 per cent on Monday.
No date has been chosen for a rate move but the Bank estimates the average
lag between changes in rates and those of inflation at around two years.
It would therefore have to tighten policy no later than the first quarter of
next year if it were to bring underlying inflation below 2.5 per cent in the
second quarter of 1997 - the latest date for the next general election.
'The stance of monetary policy must be set on the basis of a judgment of
where inflation will be in some two years or so,' said the report. 'This is
especially important at turning points in official interest rates.'
The Bank added three more inflationary risks to the three outlined in its
May inflation report - money supply growth, a rise in average earnings, and
inflationary expectations in the financial markets.
The report says that new dangers are recent rises in commodity prices, the
prospect of a rebound in corporate profit margins and the risk that the
economy is closer to its full growth potential than previously thought.
The Bank warned that 'the pressures for higher inflation in the future may
be building up even as the published inflation rate for the past continues
to fall. It is possible, though not yet certain, that the United Kingdom is
entering this phase'.
Analysts said the arguments in the report would provide some useful
ammunition for the governor if and when he tried to persuade the chancellor
to increase base rates.
Labour was quick to criticise the Bank's statement, claiming that a
tightening of monetary policy would threaten economic recovery.
Mr Nick Brown, a Labour Treasury spokesman, pointed out that UK short-term
interest rates were already higher than in the US and Japan. 'On top of the
biggest tax hike in history, and rising utility prices, homeowners can now
expect a rise in mortgage rates, too,' he said.
Mr Malcolm Bruce, the Liberal Democrats' new Treasury spokesman, said the
authorities needed to raise rates now.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Battle looms as US group bids Dollars 8.5bn for Cyanamid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The spate of deals reshaping the US drugs industry looked set to continue
yesterday as a battle loomed for control of American Cyanamid, a US
healthcare and agricultural products group.
American Home Products, whose interests range from prescription drugs to
confectionery, offered Dollars 8.5bn (Pounds 5.48bn) in cash for Cyanamid.
Its bid of Dollars 95 a share compared with a market price of Dollars 63 3/4
before trading in Cyanamid's stock was suspended yesterday afternoon.
The bid came hours after it emerged that SmithKline Beecham, the
Anglo-American drugs group, is in talks about acquiring Cyanamid's
pharmaceuticals and healthcare products businesses. That proposal would
involve SmithKline Beecham swapping its own vaccine and animal health
businesses for the Cyanamid units.
The all-cash nature of the Home Products bid raised the spectre of a
break-up of Cyanamid, with proceeds from the sale of parts of the company
being used to pay part of the acquisition costs. Home Products reported
borrowings of around Dollars 1bn and shareholders' funds of Dollars 3.9bn as
at the end of 1993.
Last year, Cyanamid is estimated to have generated about Dollars 1.4bn of
its Dollars 4.3bn of sales from prescription drugs, with another Dollars 1bn
from human vaccines, Dollars 500m from other healthcare products and Dollars
1.4bn from agricultural products.
The Home Products offer was detailed in a letter the company said it had
sent to Mr Albert Costello, Cyanamid's chairman and chief executive. Home
Products said the offer was subject to approval by its own board, as well as
by US anti-trust authorities and the elimination of any defences Cyanamid
had put up against a takeover. Also, in an apparent reference to the
SmithKline Beecham talks, it said the deal was dependent on Cyanamid not
making any significant asset sales.
Home Products' intervention was expected to meet with a cold response from
Cyanamid, though the large premium over yesterday's market price suggested
that Cyanamid's board could be forced to accept the offer unless a better
deal is proposed.
Under Mr Costello, the company is half way through a wide-ranging
restructuring, which has involved it spinning off its chemicals business and
announcing big cuts in its drugs business.
If it was to be completed, a Home Products takeover would be the biggest
acquisition in the US drugs industry since the merger wave of 1989, which
created industry giants such as SmithKline Beecham and Bristol-Myers Squibb.

FT  03 AUG 94 / SmithKline and Cyanamid look at Dollars 3bn business swap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American healthcare group, is in talks to
acquire the drugs business of US company Cyanamid in an exchange of
businesses with combined annual sales of more than Dollars 3bn(Pounds
1.90bn).
If completed, the transaction would mark SmithKline Beecham's second big
expansion in the US pharmaceuticals market this year. Two months ago, the
company agreed to pay Dollars 2.3bn for Diversified Pharmaceutical Services,
a drugs distributor. Cyanamid's drugs business, with annual sales of Dollars
1.4bn, would give SmithKline Beecham a broader range of products to sell
through Diversified.
The companies are discussing a swap of SmithKline Beecham's vaccine and
animal health businesses, with annual sales of Dollars 1.2bn, for most of
Cyanamid's medical operations.
SmithKline Beecham would acquire the consumer healthcare division and
generic, non-patented drugs operations, while Cyanamid would retain its
vaccines business.
Neither company was prepared to confirm the talks. Sources close to the deal
stressed there were still a number of details to be concluded. No investment
bank advisers have yet been instructed to work on the transaction, according
to one of the group's usual financial advisers.
The deal would give SmithKline Beecham total annual drugs sales of about
Dollars 6.2bn, according to an estimate by Lehman Brothers. It would remain
the fourth largest manufacturer of branded pharmaceuticals.
'The swap would make strategic sense,' said Mr Kevin Scotcher,
pharmaceuticals analyst at brokers Kleinwort Benson. 'The operating profits
of the two sides' businesses are about the same, and SmithKline Beecham
could cut costs quickly to drive up margins.'
The acquisition would also provide SmithKline Beecham with new therapeutic
areas such as cancer, which the company could market through Diversified.
Cyanamid's drugs subsidiary, Lederle has a strong position in the market for
cancer products and holds a 52 per cent stake in Immunex, a Seattle-based
group specialising in cancer.
The deal would make Cyanamid the world's leading vaccines maker, and boost
it from number 10 to number one in sales of animal health products, an
Dollars 11bn market. SmithKline Beecham's animal health and vaccines
businesses had generated operating profits of about Dollars 95m and between
Dollars 120m and Dollars 140m respectively last year.
SmithKline Beecham's vaccines business had sales of about Dollars 490m last
year, while Cyanamid's vaccines operations had a turnover of Dollars 305m.

Stet, the Italian state telecommunications holding company, could be
privatised as soon as this autumn, Mr Michele Tedeschi, the former managing
director, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Rome.
'I hope that the programme to start Stet's privatisation this autumn can be
respected,' said Mr Tedeschi, who took over yesterday as chairman of Iri,
the state holding company and Stet's parent.
He said the sale would take place after the launch of Telecom Italia, the
company that will be formed from the merger of Italy's five domestic
telecoms groups, this month.
Analysts value Stet at L27,000bn-L30,000bn (Dollars 16.8bn-Dollars 18.7bn).
Meanwhile, Stet said it expected group income this year to rise about 9 per
cent from last year's level of L29,800bn.
It said the operating result this year would be more than 19 per cent of its
1994 income.
Stet only gave percentage increases. However, they would work out to
L32,480bn for turnover and an operating result of L6,170bn up from L5,250bn
for the same period last year.
The group forecast net debt would fall to under L20,000bn in 1994 from
L22,000bn last year. As a result, the group's debt ratio would fall to 43
per cent at the end of this year, from 51 per cent at the of the previous
year.
Stet said that by 1997, income would amount to about L40,000bn with
investments amounting to about L30,000bn.
Cashflow would help bring about a further cut in net financial debt to
L14,4000bn with the total debt ratio dropping to 30 per cent.
Stet said the ratio between net financial debt and con-solidated income
would fall to 36 per cent from 74 per cent at the end of the previous year.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Fickleness and frenzy in Shanghai: The surge in the value of
shares in China after announcements to bolster investor confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China's fledgling stock markets have proved themselves among the world's
most volatile, but analysts were not prepared for yesterday's extraordinary
bounce in the value of the country's A-shares for local investors.
After the markets had appeared to be in free fall for months, the Shanghai
index's astonishing 36 per cent rise demonstrated the fickleness of
sentiment among Chinese stock punters.
Starved of good news since the markets began their protracted decline last
year - the A-share market is down 80 per cent - investors have for the
moment grasped a glimmer of promise provided in the announcement that new
share listings would be suspended for this year and possibly next.
With investors stampeding back into a market they had deserted in droves,
there can hardly have been a better example of the herd mentality, but
analysts believe the rally in A-shares will be shortlived. Mr John Crossman,
of Jardine Fleming in Shanghai, said: 'I don't think it will hold very well
because the fundamentals are simply not there.'
In Beijing, China's hard-pressed stock regulators are finding it difficult
to believe that a simple package of announcements would have galvanised the
market quite so dramatically.
After coming under heavy pressure to take measures to boost the markets,
officials of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) announced at
the weekend that, apart from suspending new issues, they would allow the
establishment of Sino-foreign joint ventures to trade in A-shares and would
also pump money into 'selected securities institutions to enliven trading'.
Mr Gao Xiqing, general counsel to the CSRC, was a 'little surprised' at the
magnitude of yesterday's surge, but he also noted that China was making
progress in its efforts to build confidence in the markets by strengthening
regulation.
He observed that one of the most positive developments was the decision to
allow foreigners to trade A-shares through joint venture securities houses.
This was a step towards combining the A and B-share markets. B-shares for
foreigners are denominated in yuan but are traded in US and Hong Kong
dollars.
The eventual formal amalgamation of the A and B-share markets will depend,
however, on the yuan becoming freely convertible. Chinese officials are
vague about the timing of such a move, saying merely they expect it will
happen 'within five years'.
In contrast to the surge in the A-share market yesterday, B-shares
registered modest gains. The Shanghai index was up just 1.31 points or 1.83
per cent.
Shanghai securities analysts say that after being in the doldrums for much
of the year, B-shares had begun to attract support among 'bargain hunters'
in the past few weeks with Japanese securities houses believed to have
entered the market. They saw no reason why B-shares should not continue to
strengthen.
Price/earnings ratios had come down to multiples in the low teens from the
high teens early in the year. Some quality companies' price/earnings ratios
were below 10 ,which had rekindled investor interest.
Mr Crossman also noted that H-shares - mainland companies listed in Hong
Kong - had been strongly traded in the past few weeks. 'Local players have
been punching up H-shares,' he said. 'Now you're getting a wash of
enthusiasm for China-related plays.'
He expected that B-shares, which were down this year by some 40 per cent at
their low point - the index has appreciated by about 10 per cent since June
 -would continue to strengthen. 'We're looking for a good sustainable rally
from October through the early part of next year,' he said.
Among factors that are helping to feed a slight improvement in investor
confidence are signs that China's economic austerity measures are beginning
to bear fruit with unsustainable rates of growth coming down and inflation
showing signs of abating.
Investors may be betting on the government easing credit restrictions in the
latter part of the year. Indeed, there are already indications that the
central bank selectively is loosening the purse strings to assist faltering
state enterprises.
Chinese securities regulators argue that lack of institutional investors -
most investors are individuals - is one of the main causes of market
volatility, but analysts cite other causes such as the relatively small
percentage of shares in a particular company on offer in the market.
Under the Chinese system less than a third of a company's shares are traded
and these are held mainly by individuals. Other shares are vested in the
state or held by 'legal persons' such as institutions, corporations and
quasi-government bodies.
This structure is aimed at preserving state control as more than 50 per cent
of shares are reserved for the state, but analysts argue that if the
authorities allowed 'legal person' shares to be traded freely this would
'make for a healthier market'.
A 36 per cent rise in one day would not seem to be evidence of a market's
good health: rather it indicates inherent instability. China's stock markets
are destined for a continuing rollercoaster ride as investors' febrile
sentiment ebbs and flows.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Chinese stocks surge on Beijing rescue package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China's infant stock markets surged by more than 30 per cent yesterday
fuelled by a buying frenzy after Beijing announced a rescue package aimed at
arresting a disastrous slide in share values.
Shanghai's A-share index for local investors leapt by 36.14 per cent to
447.68 points in an astonishing reversal of the sharp declines of recent
months. The Shanghai index had lost 80 per cent since highs of early 1993.
The smaller Shenzen exchange in territory adjacent to Hong Kong also
rocketed ahead. The Shenzen A-share index leapt by 33.94 per cent to 127.59
points.
Securities analysts attributed the rise to a change of sentiment among
fickle investors who had been seeking positive news that might justify a
return to the markets they had abandoned in the past year.
But these analysts doubt that the China A-share markets will hold on to
their gains. They expect the markets will continue to be highly volatile.
China's B shares, reserved for foreigners and traded in US and Hong Kong
dollars, recorded modest gains. The Shanghai B-share index rose just 1.83
per cent. Shenzen's gain was less than  1/2 per cent.
The astonishing leap in China's market followed the announcement last Friday
by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) that it was suspending
new share listings this year.
The CSRC, which has been under enormous pressure from disgruntled investors,
also gave notice that it would permit Sino-foreign joint venture security
houses to trade in A-shares, previously reserved for Chinese. This
potentially important concession points the way to an eventual merging of
the A and B-share markets once the yuan is a fully convertible currency.
Rampaging Chinese investors also appeared to be responding to improving
economic news, with indications that the government was bringing an
overheating economy under control. Growth rates have slowed and inflation is
coming down, raising the prospect of the authorities easing a credit
squeeze.

Italy's state railroad has awarded Olivetti, the Italian computers group,
and IBM of the US a contract to modernise the ticket-dispensing system in
the 500 main Italian train stations, AP-DJ reports from Milan.
The state railroad said that when the multi-year supply agreement was
completed the value of the accord should exceed L400bn (Dollars 256m). The
agreement involves the installation of 1,400 'intelligent machines' for
ticket dispensing at booths in the stations as well as 300 self-service
ticket machines.
Under the terms of the eight-year contract, Olivetti and IBM will also
provide the maintenance and base software, train personnel to service the
machines, manage technical services and establish a national supervision and
control centre.

<TEXT>
The Malaysian state of Penang, once home to one of the British East India
Company's most important Asian ports, is set to reclaim its status as a big
trading centre in south-east Asia following approval for Butterworth to
become a free port, writes Christine Hill in Kuala Lumpur.
Singapore is now the most important free port in the region. Seventy-five
per cent of all intra-Asean trade, most of which is later shipped on to
third countries, goes through the island state. Strategically located along
the Straits of Malacca, Penang's shipping business declined in the 1960s for
political reasons. The Malaysian government withdrew the state's free-port
status.

FT  02 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Oman and India agree Dollars 850m venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MUSCAT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Oman and India have signed an agreement for the construction of a 50-50
joint venture urea export fertiliser plant at Sur on the Arabian Sea coast
200km south of Muscat. A memorandum of understanding for the Dollars 850m
venture was signed by the state-owned Oman Oil Company (OOC) and India's
chemicals and fertiliser minister, Mr Ram Lakhan Singh.
The Indian government will buy the entire output from the Indian joint
venture partners, Maharashtra-based Rashtriya Chemicals &amp; Fertilisers and
Gujarat-based Krishak Bharati Co-operative. The urea plant will have a
capacity of 1.4m tonnes a year. Construction will start in 1996 with
completion planned for 1999.
India will pay Oman at prevailing market prices. The agreement in principle
to build the plant was reached last year during a visit to Oman by India's
prime minister, Mr P V Narasimha Rao.
Sur was chosen as the construction site because of its natural harbour for
terminal and loading facilities and proximity to Oman's centrally located
gasfields at Fahud, Yibal, Huwaisah, Saih Rawl, Barik and Huraymah.
It is also the nearest Omani port to the off-loading terminals on India's
Gujarat coast.
Oman has been quick to seize on the potential of India and Asia as export
markets for its natural resources. India's demand for fertilisers has been
rising 3-4 per cent a year.
The venture with India is part of Oman's strategy to broaden its export base
and diversify. Oil production amounts to 800,000 barrels a day and with gas
is responsible for three-quarters of annual budget revenue.
About one-third of Oman's gas reserves are now committed to Asian markets
under the Oman Liquefied Natural Gas Company, a joint venture between the
government, three foreign shareholders of Petroleum Development Oman, and
three Japanese companies.
The oil sector is handled by the Oman Oil Company, which negotiates with
western oil companies and seeks downstream export markets. It is also
involved in various ventures including the urea export plant, pipelines and
refineries.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Schemes earmarked for government spending cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The schemes identified by Mr Portillo cost more than Pounds 350m in 1993-94,
excluding receipts from loans, but spending on some of the programmes is
scheduled to fall over the following three years while others rise modestly,
Andrew Baxter writes.
In detail, the schemes are:
Regional selective assistance: discretionary grants to support investment
projects in assisted areas cost an estimated Pounds 89.2m in 1993-94, up
from Pounds 71m in 1992-93. A further increase to Pounds 104m is planned by
1996-97.
Consultancy initiative for small companies: along with local business
support, this cost an estimated Pounds 92.2m in 1993-94, down slightly from
Pounds 95.2m in 1992-93, and is planned to fall to Pounds 83m in 1996-97.
Launch aid: a risk-sharing investment by government in the development of
civil aerospace projects, payments dropped from Pounds 32.9m in 1992-93 to
an estimated Pounds 4.6m in 1993-94. Plans are for payments of Pounds 6.6m
this year, Pounds 25.3m in 1995-96 - including Pounds 20m to Short Brothers
for the Learjet 45 project - and Pounds 8.4m in 1996-97.
The government's net receipts, which it gets once projects reach a certain
production stage, were an estimated Pounds 58.1m in 1993-94. After falling
this year they are budgeted to rise to Pounds 80.9m by 1996-97.
Shipbuilding: loans of Pounds 21m were made under the Home Shipbuilding
Credit Guarantee Scheme in 1992-93. Loan payments received in 1993-94 were
about Pounds 6.8m. Receipts will stay around this level until 1996-97. The
Shipbuilding Intervention Fund made grants of about Pounds 22m in 1993-94,
but these will fall to Pounds 6m by 1996-97.
Space: the National Space Programme cost Pounds 20.4m in 1992-93, falling to
an estimated Pounds 14.7m in 1993-94. Again, spending is due to decline
further, to Pounds 9.2m this year and Pounds 6.3m in 1996-97.
On top of this is the cost of membership to the European Space Agency, which
Mr Portillo wants reconsidered. Total agency spending by the DTI was an
estimated Pounds 76.8m in 1993-94, rising gradually to a planned Pounds
80.5m in 1996-97.
R&amp;D spending on non-nuclear energy technologies: this was an estimated
Pounds 35.6m in 1993-94, up slightly on the Pounds 33.4m of the previous
year. It will stay at about Pounds 30m-Pounds 31m a year until 1996-97. The
lion's share goes to renewable and novel sources of energy.
Export promotion: programmes in 'established markets' are targeted by Mr
Portillo. Europe and North America accounted for 36 per cent of export
promotion spending in 1992. Total gross spending on international trade and
export promotion was an estimated Pounds 56.7m in 1993-94, to rise to Pounds
60.9m in 1996-97.

FT  02 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome wanted
</HEADLINE>

   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and SAQIB QURESHI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wellcome, the UK pharmaceuticals group, forged ahead 14 3/4 to 648p after
one of its competitors was obliged to withdraw a key treatment for epilepsy
in the US.
Carter-Wallace, of the US, sent a letter to 240,000 doctors advising
immediate withdrawal of patients from its Felbatol treatment after the
appearance of side effects. It was one of three new entrants into an
estimated Dollars 550m market dominated, according to analysts, by cheap
generic products, many of which produce side effects.
Wellcome's Lamictal is one of two other new products expected to gain
approval shortly from the US Food and Drug Administration.
Although there has been some concern that the FDA is clamping down on new
products following restraint on recent applications by SmithKline Beecham
and Merck, one analyst said he had spoken to the FDA and was confident that
the approval process would not be slowed down.
The latest figures from Abbey National, the second of the big banking groups
to report interim results, saw the share price fall 12 to 385p. The profits
of Pounds 423m were above expectations but, as with Lloyds Bank, they were
increased by a sharp fall in the provisions for bad debts and there was
disappointment that Abbey's share of the mortgage market was less than
expected.
The bank also announced an insurance joint venture with Commercial Union,
which rose 2 on the news but slipped back to close a net 2 softer at 548p.
The deal is expected to squeeze rival Sun Alliance, which receded 9 to 322p
as two large blocks of shares were placed in the market.
National Westminster Bank, which reports today, improved 5 to 453p, with a
block of 1m shares going through the Seaq system at 451p.
Tobacco and insurance conglomerate BAT Industries was the most heavily
traded stock in London as a result of technical trading in the shares and in
put options.
A block of 9.5m was traded at 444 1/2 p and 9,500 short-dated puts
representing 9.5m shares were also sold. Initially, it appeared that the
trade might be a way of getting into the shares at 434p, close to the price
of the shares after the payment of the 8.5p dividend next week. The stock
ended the day 5 1/2 higher at 447p on turnover of 30m, the highest for more
than a year.
Mining group RTZ jumped 21 1/2 to 884p on news of increased copper
production. There was also talk of a buy recommendation from BZW, but the
house was unavailable for comment late yesterday.
Oil shares rose in early trade as the price of Brent crude was pushed higher
on supply worries as a result of the strikes in Nigeria. Brent crude
deliverable in September broke above Dollars 19 a barrel, its highest level
in 15 months. Shell Transport added 7 at 737p, British Petroleum firmed a
half-penny but ended a penny down on the day at 411 1/2 p as US investors
sold into strength ahead of second-quarter figures today.
Retailer WH Smith was the focus for bearish stories which combined to push
the shares down 7 to 452p. Prominent among these was the suggestion that the
newspaper price war may prompt News International and The Telegraph group to
consider setting up their own wholesale distribution systems. There was also
talk that the newspaper industry was considering putting pressure on Smith
to reduce its charges. Finally, VAT fears were also circulating, further
undermining the Smith share price. The move by the Independent newspaper to
cut its cover price to 30p, the same level as the Telegraph, ruffled
feathers among publishing stocks. Telegraph shares slipped 3 to 365p.
Suggestions that motor dealer T. Cowie may announce a lucrative deal
together with today's interim figures helped the shares harden 4 1/2 to
268p. Hopes of an important order also kept GKN 2 ahead at 622p.
A broker's recommendation powered engineering group Glynwed International,
the shares firming 3 to 377p. NatWest Securities said: 'As the recovery in
the UK continues to gather pace and profits growth outstrips that of the
market in general we believe there is plenty of scope for further
outperformance.'
Conglomerate Harrisons &amp; Crosfield gained 7 at 179p as the market
appreciated the group's Pounds 167m sale of its Indonesian plantations,
announced late on Friday.
Analysts at BZW, which remains neutral on the stock, welcomed the deal,
saying Harrisons had received a better price than anticipated. In addition,
they said the deal was not as dilutive of share earnings as originally
feared and had favourable tax implications for the company.
A buy recommendation from Goldman Sachs helped Trafalgar House firm 2 1/2 to
80p. There was good demand for Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel, which has
received approval for a provisional licence to operate a limited passenger
service. The shares rose 15 to 329p.
Construction group Ashtead jumped 21 to 383p after announcing a 150 per cent
full-year profits increase to Pounds 7.1m. RMC gained 6 at 958p as Kleinwort
Benson upgraded its profits forecast for 1996. Chemicals group Wolstenholme
Rink climbed 20 to 723p, reflecting demand in a weak market.

FT  02 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Move by Tesco awaited
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and SAQIB QURESHI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Speculators continued to drive ahead shares in William Low, the Scottish
supermarket group, on growing expectations that a counter-bid from Tesco to
last week's Pounds 210m offer from J. Sainsbury is imminent. Low shares
raced up 17 to 340p with turnover at 1.6m.
Many analysts believe Tesco will return to the fray at 350p a share - 125p a
share more than its original offer three weeks ago. Sainsbury has offered
305p a share.
Sector analysts expressed some concern about the implications of the
suggested bid prices for Wm Low. According to NatWest Securities, a Tesco
bid at 350p (financed equally by cash and equity) would be earnings dilutive
by 0.89 per cent in 1994-95, becoming enhancing by 2.67 per cent the year
after.
Significantly, at 380p, the dilution to Tesco's earnings increases to more
than 1 per cent, while Sainsbury's are enhanced by 1.52 per cent, suggesting
that Sainsbury's staying power at higher levels may be greater than Tesco's.
But Mr Jeremy Allun-Jones at Lehman Brothers said: 'Such short term
considerations may not count for much if the prize is to be number two in
Scotland.'
Tesco advanced 5 to 236 1/2 p, while Sainsbury appreciated 4 1/2 to 412p.

FT  02 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares recover as interest rate
worries recede - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The return to existing interest rates in the London money market restored
calm in the UK stock market yesterday, enabling the FT-SE 100 Index to
recoup Friday's fall. It was a cautious session, at first, until the US
dollar rallied from the initial loss which greeted news that the US had
launched trade sanction proceedings against Japan.
At the close, when the Dow Industrial Average was also forging higher, the
FT-SE 100 Index was 14.8 up at 3,097.4. There was some underlying
nervousness ahead of publication today of the Bank of England's Quarterly
Bulletin, which is expected to provide further insight into the Bank's views
on inflation prospects for the UK economy. Little heed was paid to the
disclosure of a slight slowdown in domestic M0 money supply.
Equities opened slowly, gathering confidence as short-dated gilts improved
and sterling lost some of the gains achieved on Friday when a rise in base
rates had appeared on the cards. The market turned quickly, however, when
stock index futures opened higher. The upturn was confirmed when the Bank of
England provided money market assistance at established rates, implying that
base rates will stay at 5.25 per cent, at least for the time being. Equity
strategists agree that base rates are likely to rise before the end of the
year but forecasters were unsettled by the Bank's actions on Friday.
After easing off the top at midsession as London waited to see how Wall
Street would react to the trade sanctions move against Japan, the UK market
turned higher again as the dollar rallied. The Dow Average, untroubled by a
slight rise in the US Purchasing Managers Index in July, showed a gain of 10
points in UK hours. The Footsie closed within a whisker of the day's best,
with 3,100 again close at hand.
The focus on the blue chips and Footsie futures-listed stocks left the
second liners somewhat on the sidelines. At 3,641.4, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index
put on only 1.2 points.
Seaq volume of 544.7m shares, against 508.7m on Friday, reflected increased
turnover in the second half of the session as the market regained
confidence. Business in non-Footsie stocks made up just under 60 per cent of
the day's total volume. On Friday, retail, or customer, business at Pounds
1.18bn was unexciting, indicating that base rate concern did not prompt any
great rush out of equities.
There was support for Shell Transport and RTZ, benefiting respectively from
strength in oil and metals prices. Other dollar stocks were subdued at first
by uncertainty in the US currency but gained ground towards the close.
Pharmaceuticals stocks, in particular, continued to find selective support
from the international fund managers, and dealers said that institutional
activity had reached satisfactory levels by the end of the session.
Consumer stocks recovered from the shock suffered on interest rate prospects
but made little progress. Interest in the media and similar service sectors
was subdued.
The focus remained on the speculative sector, with shares in Wm Low, the
Scottish supermarket group, continuing to signal market expectations that
the Tesco directors will sanction a higher bid in an attempt to drive J.
Sainsbury off.
The banking sector, experiencing its half-term reporting season, showed
mixed movements, with Lloyds Bank still overshadowed by Friday's trading
statement. Abbey National, the housing and banking group which reported
yesterday, turned lower as analysts expressed some caution over the housing
finance results.
Across the broader range of industrial stocks, it was the capital goods and
engineering sectors which performed best as the market turned its attention
back towards the progress of recovery in the UK.

FT  02 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A large deal in the traded options sector was the only outstanding feature
in an otherwise dull day in the derivatives, writes Joel Kibazo.
In traded options, the day's big trade was carried out in BAT Industries
stock options. Kleinwort Benson was said to have sold 9,500 of the August
550 puts to Smith New Court at 116p. Dealers suggested that the deal had
been timed to coincide with next week's dividend payout in BAT.
That trade helped to raise total volume in the sector to 27,320 contracts by
the close. Some 5,378 were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 3,595 in the
Euro FT-SE option. Among the other stock options, RTZ saw business of 1,279
lots and 1,078 were traded in Asda.
In futures, dealers also reported a cautious session, with few of the big
institutions willing to deal.
Having opened at 3,090, the September futures contract on the FT-SE 100
moved forward on sporadic buying by independent(local) traders and some
buying from UBS. It reached the day's high of 3,119 at mid-morning, before
profit-taking left it trading around the 3,100 over the next few hours.
A firm opening on Wall Street brought a renewed advance for the contract and
it finished at 3,108, up 13 from its previous close and at a good premium to
cash of 11 points. Volume, at 7,398 lots, was poor.

FT  02 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Recent good earnings news
holds sway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks yesterday extended their rally into a second session, as equity
investors brushed aside a mild down-turn in bond prices on fresh evidence of
the economy's strength, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 33.67 higher at 3,798.17, just shy
of the session's peak. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 added 2.75 at 461.01.
Volume on the Big Board was a moderate 258m shares.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite rose 1.93 to 439.62. The
Nasdaq composite ended 2.69 higher at 724.85 after a power outage knocked
out the market's computer systems and halted trading for half an hour during
the afternoon.
Looking back on a corporate results season which brought news of strong
earnings, equity investors were in a buoyant mood as the trading week
commenced. After Friday's 33-point Dow advance, shares opened higher and
built on their early gains even though the day's economic data may have
rekindled fears over interest rates.
Such misgivings, quelled on Friday by favourable data on second-quarter
economic growth, resurfaced with the release of the monthly survey conducted
by the National Association of Purchasing Management. Its overall index for
July inched forward, defying expectations of a decline. The report also
contradicted Friday's data by showing that business inventories had fallen.
The news pushed bond prices down, though the losses were modest. But
equities chose instead to accentuate the positive on the heels of the
impressive performance by the corporate sector in the quarter.
Cyclical issues again led the advance. General Motors climbed Dollars 1 1/2
to Dollars 52 7/8 , Caterpillar Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 109 7/8 and United
Technologies by Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 61 3/4 .
Steel shares gathered strength on speculation that Chrysler was willing to
pay a 10 per cent price increase to its leading suppliers. Inland Steel
advanced Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 40 1/4 , National Steel Dollars 1 3/4 to
Dollars 21 5/8 and USX-US Steel Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 39 1/8 .
The day's big loser was Carter Wallace, which plunged 31 per cent after the
company recommended that doctors stop prescribing its Felbatol treatment for
seizures. The stock fell Dollars 4 7/8 to Dollars 10 3/4 amid concern over
the drug's side-effects.
CBS's share price appreciated on renewed speculation over its future. The
stock put on Dollars 2 3/4 at Dollars 314 3/4 after Mr Ted Turner, owner of
the Cable News Network, told reporters that he was interested in acquiring
the media group.
Most technology stocks improved. IBM moved up Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 63
and Lotus Development Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 32 7/8 . But Motorola shed
Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 51 7/8 on news of a 38 per cent drop in prices on
its digital access equipment.
On the Nasdaq, Newbridge Networks plummeted Dollars 13 3/4 to Dollars 28 1/8
after issuing a profits warning.
Brazil
Sao Paulo declined 1.17 per cent in local currency terms in light trade, led
by a strong sell-off in the telecoms sector after news that Telebras was
planning a RDollars 320m preferred share subscription.
The Bovespa index of the 56 most-active shares finished 493 off at 41,520 in
weak volume of RDollars 220.1m (Dollars 236.1m).
Telebras preferred closed 1.8 per cent down at RDollars 43.10, while its
common stock dropped 3.2 per cent to RDollars 32.80.
A lack of new foreign funds due to continued concern over the real/US dollar
exchange rate also weighed on share prices.

FT  02 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Italy falls on political confusion
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Political influences sent equity markets in Italy and Mexico in opposite
directions last week. Italy dropped by 3.1 per cent in local currency terms
as the strains on Mr Silvio Berlusconi's government mounted, but Mexico
advanced by 9.1 per cent. Of the latter, Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging Markets
said the 'explosive rally' was prompted by optimism over second-quarter
earnings, sharply lower interest rates and the growing lead in the polls for
Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the ruling party's presidential candidate. In the Far
East, Hong Kong and Malaysia rose by 3.6 and 3.7 per cent respectively,
reflecting the revival in Pacific Basin markets, ex Japan.

FT  02 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses offer limited reaction
to peak oil price
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Oil prices peaked again in London yesterday, but there was limited reaction
in individual oil company share prices on the Continent, writes Our Markets
Staff. Zurich was closed for a public holiday.
FRANKFURT reported US interest in Volkswagen, and a rise in BASF ahead of
the chemical industry's results season, as the Dax index rose 7.15 to
2,153.79, picking up in the post-bourse to end at an Ibis-indicated
2,161.50.
Turnover fell from DM5.3bn to DM4.7bn. 'This is a stock picker's market,
lacking the liquidity of 1993,' said Mr Craig Abbott of the Banque Nationale
de Paris team in Frankfurt.
In the automotive sector, VW rose DM5.90 to DM507.90 as BMW fell DM5.50 to
DM861.50. Among special, or specialised, industrial situations, Lufthansa
put on DM7.50 at DM211.50, PWA DM4.70 at DM235, and SAP 115 at DM3,770. But
Mr Abbott said that, in each case, share price moves were probably
exaggerated by the lack of liquidity.
There was a more studied look about the gains of DM4.10 to DM320.50 in BASF,
and DM2.70 to DM363.50 in Bayer. BASF was regarded as the purest bulk
chemicals play in the German market, while Bayer fans were subdued a little
by worrying developments in US pharmaceuticals.
PARIS saw low volume, little obvious reaction to the oil price and, in
chemicals, mild trepidation instead of excitement about the Rhone Poulenc
first-half results expected on Thursday.
The CAC-40 index fell 5.41 to 2,069.58 in light turnover of FFr2.2bn.
Alacatel Alsthom, up FFr10 at FFr658, continued to benefit from a Goldman
Sachs recommendation, but expectations of lower profits at Rhone Poulenc
left the shares FFr2.40 down at FFr130.
AMSTERDAM put in a solid performance, concentrating on a sharp rise in
futures. The AEX index gained 3.93 at 412.14, the mood enhanced further by
steady bonds and the rise in the London market.
Among cyclicals reporting tomorrow, Akzo rose Fl 2.30 to Fl 216.70 and DSM
Fl 1.40 to Fl 144.40 on hopes of sharply higher second-quarter figures.
Nedlloyd added to Friday's Fl 2.90 advance with a Fl 1.60 rise to Fl 72.50.
Small investors were said to be taking a lead from brokers' positive
recommendations.
Among recently underperforming financials, ABN-Amro closed 80 cents higher
at Fl 60.10 in volume that jumped to a heavy 1.5m shares as demand picked up
after the share price surpassed the Fl 60 resistance level.
A 90-cent advance to Fl 55.60 in Philips was attributed to favourable
reports in the Dutch press and expectations of strong earnings next week.
MILAN was indecisive ahead of today's address to parliament by Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, when the prime minister is expected to detail his plans to put
distance between his business activities and his governing role. The Comit
index edged 1.06 lower to 708.70.
Industrials were broadly weaker, with Olivetti losing L30 to L2,399 as
foreigners shied away.
Among the banks, BCI slid L75 to L4,800 but Credito Italiano added L45 at
L2,230 in response to last Friday's annual shareholders meeting. Credito did
not announce a capital increase and said that any future capital increases
would be used to fund specific investments.
The telecommunications sector was mixed. Sip dipped L16 to L4,502 while Stet
put on L6 to L5,244. Its former managing director, Mr Michele Tedeschi, who
took over yesterday as chairman of the state holding IRI hoped that the
programme to start Stet's privatisation would go ahead this autumn.
MADRID began August, a traditionally quiet month, with its share prices
elevated in thin trading, the general index recovering another 5.68, or 1.8
per cent, to 319.38 in turnover down from Pta29.7bn to Pta26.1bn.
Traders said that the market was lifted by strength in the secondary debt
market. Interest rate-sensitive stocks led the way up, with BCH and
Santander up Pta120 to Pta2,770 and Pta190 to Pta5,200 in a strong banking
sector, and Endesa and Iberdrola in utilities closing Pta130 and Pta24
higher at Pta6,260 and Pta970 respectively.
Repsol reflected the strength in world oil prices, closing Pta95 better at
Pta4,245, and Telefonica led the volume charts in 1.98m shares as it closed
Pta10 ahead at Pta1,870.
HELSINKI closed higher in relatively active trade as domestic investors
returned after the traditional July holiday period. The Hex index gained
15.0, or 0.8 per cent, at 1,860.8, taking the rise for the year so far to
17.6 per cent.
Finnair closed FM2.10 stronger at FM39.10 after reaching a new high for the
year of FM39.50, with buy recommendations from brokerage houses contributing
to the gain.
Nokia preferred firmed FM9 to FM511 following strong demand for the shares
in New York.
VIENNA woke up again as OMV, the oil, gas and chemicals group, rose Sch37,
or 4.1 per cent, to Sch946, and the ATX index by 19.87, or 1.8 per cent, to
1,097.57. OMV is due to produce results in three weeks' time, but analysts
favoured neither that, nor the global oil price, as influences on
yesterday's share price, going instead for talk of an unbundling, detaching
the loss-making chemicals division and leaving oil and gas to perform.
ATHENS rose 1.6 per cent, the general index finishing 13.56 better at 859.39
as it broke out of a 800-850 trading range.

Johannesburg made a slow start to the week, with prices ending mixed as
bullion and world bourses failed to give them direction. However, the
continued threat of labour unrest, and increased political and crime-related
violence, was said to be dampening enthusiasm for industrials.
The overall index ended 1 lower at 5,651, industrials eased 7 to 6,400 and
golds put on 4 at 2,142.
Gencor lost 10 cents at R11.80 as demand slowed after the announcement of
its purchase of Billiton. Randgold ended unchanged at R9 after news that a

Shanghai A shares surge 36%

<TEXT>
The rise in the yen on worries over the breakdown of the Japan-US trade
talks depressed some blue chip exporters, and the Nikkei 225 average lost
ground in the lowest trading volume for three months, writes Emiko Terazono
in Tokyo.
The index closed 178.04 off at the day's low of 20,271.35. Shares rose in
the morning session, pushing the index to a day's high of 20,423.78, but
fell later on arbitrage unwinding due to a drop in futures prices.
Volume shrank to 170m shares, the lowest since May 9, from Friday's 270m.
The Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 7.59 to 1,629.82 while
the Nikkei 300 lost 1.49 at 295.67. Declines outscored advances by 667 to
313, with 181 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 2.49
firmer at 1,322.50.
Traders said selling by overseas investors, which depressed equities earlier
last week, seemed to have run its course. But the sharp rebound of the yen
weighed on blue chip stocks, which had suffered from the sell-off by
foreigners.
Some analysts said further selling could depress share prices this week.
'Though bearishness prevails, the major indices have not fallen enough to
register oversold readings,' said Kleinwort Benson in its most recent
report. It predicted a downside target of 19,470 for the Nikkei 225.
Shares bought on margin in February met selling ahead of the six-month
margin expiration. Tokyo Electric Power receded Y60 to Y2,970 and Fujikura,
the optical cable maker, ended Y19 off at Y810.
High-technology issues declined, Fujitsu shedding Y20 to Y1,030, but some
electrical stocks which retreated on overseas selling last week firmed on
bargain hunting. Toshiba put on Y14 at Y747 and Hitachi gained Y4 at Y969.
Banks were lower on arbitrage selling.
Kumagai Gumi, a general contractor, climbed Y15 to Y541 on buying by foreign
brokers on expectations of higher profits on a rise in domestic demand.
In Osaka, the OSE average eased 53.15 to 22,683.34 in volume of 51m shares.
Roundup
Regional markets saw some sharply higher performances in response to local
factors and an easing of worries about the outlook for US interest rates.
SHANGHAI's A share index soared 36.1 per cent in the wake of Beijing's
freeze on all new listings and issues this year. The A shares, available
only to local investors, had collapsed by 80 per cent since a high in
February, but yesterday's rally took the index 118.83 ahead to 447.68.
The B index of shares available to foreigners picked up 1.31, or 1.8 per
cent, to 72.43, reflecting the improved market sentiment and stronger stock
prices in Hong Kong.
Shenzhen's A share index jumped 32.78, or 34.4 per cent, to 128.04 and the B
share index added 0.40 at 100.06.
HONG KONG gained 2.1 per cent, although late profit-taking had pulled shares
back from their best levels.
The Hang Seng index ended 200.87 up at 9,683.68 in heavy turnover of
HKDollars 6.3bn, against HKDollars 4.4bn on Friday.
Strong foreign institutional demand was seen, while local investors were
divided over whether to join the frey.
Property issues posted strong gains following last week's government land
auction, which allayed market fears of a squeeze on property prices. Sun
Hung Kai Properties topped the list of net gainers, adding HKDollars 2.50,
or 5 per cent, at HKDollars 52.75 while Cheung Kong rose by HKDollars 1.10,
or 2.9 per cent, to HKDollars 39.
Chinese companies' Hong Kong-listed H shares also rose sharply, on demand
from overseas funds.
KUALA LUMPUR saw strong local and foreign institutional demand for blue
chips send the benchmark index up 2.8 per cent to its highest close in three
months.
The composite index ended 28.83 stronger at 1,056.34, its largest single-day
gain since a 51.48-point rise on April 12.
The advance was attributed to good Malaysian corporate results and Friday's
rise on Wall Street.
SINGAPORE sprang to life, with foreign demand for blue chips sending the
index 1.7 per cent higher, and Kuala Lumpur's advance acting as the
catalyst. The Straits Times Industrial index moved ahead 37.47 to 2,243.89.
MANILA strengthened 2.9 per cent, the composite index rising 80.13 to
2,883.34, on the back of a sharp improvement in PLDT. The telecommunications
group added 8.8 per cent at 1,715 pesos on expectations of a strong
corporate performance during the second half of the year.
SYDNEY took its lead from Friday's Wall Street performance and the All
Ordinaries index finished 20.6 firmer at 2,082.1. BHP rose 38 cents, or 2
per cent, to ADollars 19.40, its highest close in almost six months and only
10 cents shy of its record finish.
Western Mining surged 28 cents, or 3.9 per cent, to ADollars 7.45.
WELLINGTON was lifted by a strong showing by the five leading stocks, and
the NZSE-40 capital index closed 6.10 higher at 2,033.28.
BANGKOK ended above the psychological 1,400 resistance level, as demand
emerged for the communications and property development sectors. The SET
index closed 25.10 up at 1,401.98 in more active turnover, Bt10.2bn, than in
recent days. Foreigners were said to be gradually accumulating
communications issues and the sector was the day's best performer, climbing
5.1 per cent.
TAIPEI closed 1.8 per cent up at a four-year peak on intensive buying in
plastics and electronics, and the weighted index rose 118.97 to 6,839.02,
its highest close since 7,075.50 on June 6, 1990. Turnover was a hectic
TDollars 116.36bn.
The plastics sector led the rally, jumping 3.57 per cent, because of recent
product price rises.
BOMBAY moved ahead 2 per cent in low volume amid fresh buying by speculators
and Indian companies.
The BSE 30-share index gained 85.18 at 4,276.48.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Markets Report: UK rate fears subside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears of an imminent rise in UK interest rates yesterday proved unfounded as
the Bank of England dealt at established rates in its daily money market
operations, writes Philip Gawith.
The dominant view in the market now is that a decision was taken at last
week's monthly monetary meeting not to raise rates.
There remains, however, a great deal of caution and uncertainty. The
September short sterling contract closed at 94.08, suggesting that the
market is looking for short term rates close to 6 per cent when the contract
expires on September 21.
Rates also remained firm in the cash market, with three-month money offered
at 5.75 per cent.
The last move in interest rates - the 25 basis-point cut in February - also
coincided with the publication of the quarterly inflation report, which is
again released today.
The gloomy prognosis that the pound would be heavily sold if policy were not
tightened proved unfounded. Sterling gave up all the gains it made on
Friday, but was fairly steady throughout the day and ended in London at
DM2.4221, from DM2.4413 on Friday.
Against the dollar it was barely changed at Dollars 1.5386, from Dollars
1.5366 on Friday.
The dollar held up fairly well in spite of the US launching trade sanctions
proceedings against Japan. It closed against the D-Mark at DM1.5743, down
from DM1.5888, and against the yen at Y98.85 from Friday's Y100.175. In New
York it finished at DM1.5797 and Y99.445.
The balance of opinion in UK money markets remained that the Bank of England
had mishandled the Treasury bill auction last Friday. But there was also a
readiness to admit that the market had been insufficiently attentive to the
messages the Bank was trying to send.
The Bank clearly signalled its intentions yesterday when it offered an early
round of assistance after declaring a Pounds 1.1bn market shortage. The
forecast was later revised to a Pounds 900m shortage, and the Bank provided
Pounds 893m of assistance.
Analysts said it was Bank convention to offer an early round of assistance
if the shortage was greater than Pounds 1bn. It could have kept the market
in suspense by forecasting a lower shortage and then delaying when it first
offered assistance.
Although last Friday's flurry of concern has now largely subsided, there is
anxiety that this Friday's Treasury bill tender will see a repeat
performance.
Mr Richard Phillips, analyst at brokers GNI, said: 'The signal they are
trying to send the market is that the Treasury bill tender is not an
instrument of monetary policy. But I am afraid that the market is not
getting the message.'
This was shown by the three-month sterling LIBOR rate staying at 5.75 per
cent, and the poor performance of short sterling. Although the September
contract finished 13 basis points firmer at 94.08, traders said they had
expected it to trade closer to 94.20. The December contract improved
marginally to finish at 93.30 from 93.27.
Volumes in the futures market were fairly good - the September contract
traded 28,371 lots and December 32,109 - but a long way short of Friday's
record levels.
Mr Robert Thomas, head of research at NatWest Markets, said the continued
high level of rates in the money market showed two things. First, that it
was not possible for the Bank to immediately douse the run-up in interest
rate expectations at the end of last week. Second, the market believes that
a tightening of policy is inevitable - if not now, then at least fairly
soon.
The US currency held up fairly well in spite of the sanctions announcement.
Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at Bank of America, said the key issue
was that the policy of the US Administration now seemed to be structured
towards a stronger dollar. He commented: 'The market is now happy in the
idea that the White House does not want to see a weaker dollar.'
Against this background, Mr Hawkins said: 'If the authorities were to invoke
sanctions anyway, they could be seen as an alternative to a strong yen, not
as a compliment.'
Taking a less sanguine view was Mr Malcolm Barr, international economist at
Chemical Bank. He said that although there had been a clear desire between
the US and Japan to reach an agreement, the market had not fully considered
the implications of sanctions.
This would almost certainly involve the repatriation of funds by Japanese
investors from the US, with negative implications both for markets and the
dollar.
The D-Mark was fairly firm in Europe, though attention was mostly elsewhere.
The lira remained weak against a background of political uncertainty in
Italy. The currency finished at L1,003 per D-Mark, off a low for the day of
L1,008.75.
German call money rates fell back to 5 per cent, from 5.50/5.75 per cent on
Friday. Banks said the month-end liquidity squeeze had not been as severe as
in recent months. The repo rate is currently fixed at 4.85 per cent.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Waldegrave
has the right pedigree - Britain's new agriculture minister is a farmer and
a conservationist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr William Waldegrave has the right pedigree to be a good minister of
agriculture. First and foremost he is a farmer with a majority share in a
400-hectare specialist dairy enterprise in the Mendip hills. The tenanted
farm carries three herds totalling 450 cows and while reports suggest that
he does not actually milk them himself, he must be involved in management
and knowledgeable about profitability.
Secondly, he is the son of a man who was a minister of state for agriculture
in a previous Conservative administration. Thirdly, he is a convinced
conservationist. Moreover, when he was a minister at the department of the
environment a few years ago, he made a speech at the Oxford Farming
Conference that appeared to most of his audience to strike an acceptable
balance between farming and other increasing demands on the countryside.
But his predecessor, Mrs Gillian Shephard, is a hard act to follow. She too
was the child of a farming family. She too was able to talk to her
agricultural constituency in language they understood. And in her 14 months
as minister she persuaded most farmers that she had their best interests at
heart without ever straying from government policy on stringent financial
control.
Mr Waldegrave, however, has made a promising start. At his first press
conference after being appointed minister he declared his support for farm
tenancy reform. For at least five years it has been accepted across the
industry that restrictive laws governing farm tenancies were in need of
revision. Moreover, few new tenancies have been established in recent years
because of outdated rules on lifetime security of tenure for tenant farmers.
Most landowners have avoided such traps by skirting the law and setting up
limited life contract agreements instead.
In December 1993, after years of debate and negotiation, agreement was
finally reached between the National Farmers' Union, the Country Landowners'
Association and the National Federation of Young Farmers' Clubs on a more
flexible type of agreement for new tenancies. All that was needed was
parliamentary time to enact the necessary legislation to bring about the
changes. Mr Waldegrave gave a commitment that time would be found by the end
of this year.
A more contentious issue that the minister will have found on his desk is
the continuing saga of the future of the Agricultural Wages Board. The board
was scheduled to be scrapped in line with government policy on free wage
bargaining. But a campaign was launched to save it on the basis that it had
historically set reasonable conditions and minimum rates for farm work that
had become the baseline for negotiations between workers and employers.
Interestingly, supporters of the AWB included employers as well as workers.
All recognised that wage bargaining by an individual worker, who might be
the only employee on a small farm, needed a statutory framework. A few
months ago it appeared likely that the government would give way and allow
the AWB to continue.
The situation has since been confused, however, by abolition demands from
some labour-intensive sectors of agriculture and horticulture and by a call
from the farm workers' union for a judicial review against the AWB, claiming
that it discriminates against part-time women workers. Mrs Shephard
indicated that she would announce her decision on the AWB before the
parliamentary recess. Mr Waldegrave says there is no rush and he would like
to talk the matter through.
A decision has already been made to wind up the Potato Marketing Board
following similar action on the Milk Marketing Boards. Potato growers are
divided, however, on the size, shape and therefore cost, of a successor body
that all agree should commission research and arrange market promotion. A
producer poll is being held that could wind up the operations of the present
board before it has time to plan for the future. If that turns out to be the
case, it will be up to the new minister to decide what, if any, successor
body is set up.
On wider issues Mr Waldegrave is known to be hostile to the European Union's
common agricultural policy because of its inefficiencies and cost, as well
as what he sees as its past failure to deliver environmental benefits. It is
highly probable that, along with the other EU agriculture ministers, he will
have an opportunity to help re-reform it.
On the domestic front, however, he will need to address the ever-worsening
problem of the food trade gap - the difference in value between the food the
UK exports and that which it imports. At present, that gap is some Pounds
6bn per year and rising and many people in food and farming, myself among
them, believe that there is an urgent need to create an effective initiative
to promote British food to British people.
These are just a few of the issues William Waldegrave will find in his
in-tray at Maff. And as most other UK farmers gather their grain harvest he
will begin the complicated task of familiarising himself with his brief.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rally in coffee futures
mystifies London traders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coffee futures rose strongly in New York and London yesterday, but traders
were casting about for justification.
'It's a bit of a mystery to me quite why it's proceeding in a northerly
direction,' admitted one London-based trader.
Volumes were fairly thin and traders turned to charts to explain the rise,
saying the New York September contract appeared to have found support at 200
cents a pound, while 'for the moment' London's second position seemed keen
to stay above the Dollars 3,300 a tonne reached on July 1 between the two
Brazilian frosts.
The November robusta position in London opened sharply higher and ended just
off its highs at Dollars 3,493 a tonne, up Dollars 140. In afternoon trading
in New York, the December position was up 9.20 cents at 215.20 cents a
pound.
One factor in the market was renewed concern about the quality of Brazilian
coffee stocks, after roasters bought up only about half the stocks offered
at auction last Friday.
This gave some support to suggestions by the US Department of Agriculture
that only about 9m bags of Brazil's 17m-bag stockpile might be fit for
consumption.
Running counter to this, some traders expressed scepticism about the
Brazilian government's estimate last week that 11m bags of next year's crop,
or 40 per cent, might have been affected by the frost. Independent estimates
have ranged from 6m to 9m bags.

planned

<TEXT>
Intervention prices that have encouraged huge surpluses in Europe's fruit
and vegetable sector would be reduced to 'unprofitable' levels under
proposals for reform unveiled by the European Commission.
The sector, which costs the European Union's common agricultural policy
budget Ecu1.6bn (Pounds 1.26m) a year to administer, is one of three - with
wine and sugar - that escaped overhaul in the MacSharry reforms of 1992.
However, Mr Rene Steichen, the agriculture commissioner, said last week that
the fruit and vegetable sector was generally well-tuned to the marketplace.
Announcing only modest changes, involving a redirection rather than a
reduction in funding, he said: 'If it works, why change it?'
Surpluses would be tackled, however. Producers typically destroy 600,000
tonnes of surplus, subsidised fruit and vegetables each year while.
In future, these 'withdrawal' subsidies would be set at a 'clearly
unprofitable level, well below the present withdrawal price in most cases',
said the commission paper. Producer groups would be allowed to top up these
subsidies from operating funds, half of which would be provided by the EU
and national governments. But they would be able to use only 'a limited and
decreasing proportion' of the funds for this purpose.
About 1.8m farming families depend on the fruit and vegetable sector, which
represents 16 per cent of EU agricultural output. It is particularly
important to southern states such as Spain and Italy, accounting for 27 per
cent of these countries' agricultural output.
Recognising the dependence of some sectors on intervention, Mr Steichen
proposed scaling prices down gradually over four years.
He suggested financing should be targeted at producer groups to encourage
them to expand 'to match increasingly concentrated distribution'. Funding
would increase if groups forged cross-border links. Money would also be made
available for grubbing-up surplus crops.
Mr Steichen rejected the idea of output quotas or area aid payments and said
the thrust of policy should be to improve quality and market dynamism.
Producer groups could use their operating funds to promote products and
encourage environmentally-friendly growing and packing methods.
The proposals are expected to be discussed by agriculture ministers in
September.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: October start for French
rapeseed futures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Matif, the French futures exchange, has announced that it will begin trading
in oilseed rape futures on October 28.
The contract denominated in D-Marks but with continuous conversion into
French francs and dollars, will be the first in Europe's dominant oilseed to
be traded on a European exchange. The only other oilseed rape contract is
traded on the Winnipeg exchange in Canada.
The futures contract, developed in conjuction with the French oilseeds trade
group Onidol, will enable oilseed professionals to deal with the rapeseed
price volatility that has resulted from the reform of the European Union's
agricultural policy.
Matif expects that the main users of the contract will be French, German,
Danish and British, the main producers of oilseed rape, and is hoping for
daily turnover of 1,000 lots in the early stages.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Department of Agriculture yesterday said the country's rice
production could jump by 17 per cent this year to a record level.
Farmers in every rice-growing state except California have increased the
acreage devoted to long-grain rice. Medium-grain rice acreage rose by 18 per
cent.
As a result production could hit 9.4m tonnes. With imports expected to reach
400,000 tonnes total supplies could rise by 8 per cent to a record 10.95m
tonnes.
Rice growers have enjoyed good weather, which is increasing yields by about
3 per cent. Farmers got off to an early start with their spring planting and
favourable conditions since then have produced a crop of which USDA
officials have rated as 7 per cent 'excellent', 74 per cent 'good' and 19
per cent 'fair'.
Demand has also been increasing, although not as much as production. US
consumption is also forecast to reach a record - 5.05m tonnes. Exports are
likely to rise by 2 per cent to 4.15m tonnes, despite the decline in
Japanese demand.
After last year poor harvest, Japan is also having a better year. This could
drive both US and world prices down to between Dollars 100 and Dollars 130 a
tonne, according to USDA figures. Last year's average US price is estimated
to have been between Dollars 165 and Dollars 169 a tonne.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: El Abra sale boosts profits of
Chilean miner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After-tax profits at Codelco, Chile's state copper giant, rose by 136 per
cent during the first six months to Dollars 212.7m, although operational
earnings fell by 11.2 per cent to Dollars 306.6m.
The improved performance was largely due to the Dollars 330m received by
Codelco after the sale of 51 per cent of the El Abra deposit to Cyprus
Minerals of the US.
Copper production at Codelco's four mines fell by 7 per cent on the same
period last year to 531,900 tonnes, largely because of declining ore grades.
The fall was offset by a marginal improvement in productivity which averaged
69.05 cents a pound and by a reduction in staff from 24,820 a year ago to
22,490.
Chuquicamata, still the world's biggest copper mine, recorded costs of 64.7
cents a pound while Andina, the least efficient of Codelco's deposits, just
nudged under 80 cents. Mr Juan Villarzu, the new Codelco president, bent on
modernising the company, has targeted 60 cents a pound by the end of the
decade.
According to press reports, Mr Villarzu has persuaded the government to
provide the Dollars 450m needed to develop the Radomiro Tomic. Development
of a new, low-cost mine like Tomic is vital to the future of the company.
However, there is great pressure for Codelco to follow the El Abra model,
selling part of the deposit to the private sector.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Government Bonds: Economic data put US Treasuries in reverse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury bond prices slipped yesterday amid fresh questions about the
economy fundamentals and the timing of the next increase in short-term
interest rates.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  3/32 lower
at 86 5/16 , with the yield rising to 7.397 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was down  1/32 at 100 7/32 , to yield 5.99 per cent.
Bonds gave back some of Friday's big gains after the National Association of
Purchasing Management released the results of its July survey. The overall
index of business activity showed only a slight gain at 57.8, from 57.5 the
previous month. But analysts had expected a decline, and the disappointment
depressed bond prices across the board.
Last week's bullishness had stemmed largely from data showing an unexpected
rise in business inventories, suggesting a slowdown in activity during the
third quarter. The NAPM report not only suggested the economy was speeding
up, but it offered evidence that manufacturing stockpiles had receded last
month. In turn, the market's confidence that monetary policy was on hold had
to be re-evaluated yet again. But damage was contained at modest levels,
partly because of an encouraging dip in the NAPM's prices-paid index, which
indicated that upward pressure on the cost of raw materials had eased. The
figures allowed inflation-sensitive bonds to trim their losses going into
the afternoon session in sluggish activity.
Earlier in the day, the market traded higher on weaker-than-expected
readings on the consumer sector. The Commerce Department said personal
income had edged ahead 0.1 per cent, against forecasts of a 0.4 per cent
gain. Personal consumption climbed 0.4 per cent, slightly below forecasts of
0.6 per cent.
European government bonds ended a quiet session little changed, drifting
sideways in thin volume. Investors were reported to be holding back,
limiting themselves largely to intra-market trades, such as yield curve
lengthening, or inter-market dealing, switching from one market to another.
'Customers aren't putting any new money into the market - there's still a
lot of nervousness around,' said Mr Troy Bowler, international strategist at
Paine Webber in London.
UK gilts recouped early losses to end little changed on very thin volume,
but sentiment remained fragile after Friday's flurry of speculation over
interest rates.
Expectations of a pre-emptive interest rate increase largely abated after
the Bank of England left money market dealing rates unchanged in yesterday's
operations, indicating that base rates were to be held at 5.25 per cent. But
traders were loth to sound the all-clear before today's publication of the
central bank's quarterly inflation report. A bearish report could reignite
fears of a rate increase, they said.
Friday's rush of speculation, which began when the Bank accepted bids at up
to 5.75 per cent at its weekly T-bill auction, has left the market on
tenterhooks.
'People will be just that bit more nervous about interpreting the Bank's
moves in the future,' said Mr Peter Fellner, gilt strategist at NatWest
Markets. 'We now have a situation where the market will constantly look for
some sort of evidence that could trigger a move,' he added.
The September long-gilt future on Liffe ended the day at 101  21/32 , up
1/32 on the day.
German bonds ended a quiet session a touch firmer in extremely thin trading.
'We're caught in a range and with retail investors sidelined, that's where
we'll stay, for now,' said a bund salesman. The September bund future on
Liffe ended at 93.78, up 0.13 point.
French bonds tracked bunds slightly higher in similarly trendless trade. The
September notional futures contract on Matif ended at 117.26, up 0.24 point.
Spanish bonds put on the best performance, rising by more than a point at
the long end. The rally was partly supported by continued investor switching
out of Italian bonds, traders said. Also, investors appeared to be focusing
on Spain's improving fundamentals, especially its encouraging inflation
outlook, they said.
The yield spread on the Spanish 10-year benchmark bond over its German
counterpart narrowed to 337 basis points from 358 on Friday.
Italian bonds ended on a firmer note, in spite of fresh supply of 10- and
30-year bonds. However, sentiment remained nervous ahead of Prime Minister
Silvio Berlusconi's appearance before parliament today, where he will answer
questions about plans to separate his public office and business interests.

FT  02 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Cigna registers 53% gain in
second-quarter income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cigna, the US insurance group, continued to record strong advances in its
second-quarter health insurance business, though the costs of meeting
property/casualty claims rose.
Overall, net income saw a better-than-expected 53 per cent rise to Dollars
135m. Earnings per share were Dollars 1.86, up from Dollars 1.22.
The advance was led by health maintenance organisation (HMO) operations,
which lifted operating income to Dollars 50m from Dollars 32m. The number of
members in HMOs owned by Cigna was a fifth higher at 3.1m. Operating income
from other indemnity insurance rose 11 per cent to Dollars 80m.
Property/casualty operations showed an operating loss of Dollars 32m from
asbestos and environmental claims. But this was more than offset by falling
losses in other property/casualty operations, which dropped two-thirds to
Dollars 35m.
First-half net income rose to Dollars 249m, or Dollars 3.44 a share, from
Dollars 134m, or Dollars 1.86.

July
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most government bond markets posted modest gains in July, supported by a
gradual decline in volatility and reports indicating reasonably paced,
non-inflationary recoveries in many countries, according to JP Morgan's bond
index monitor.
Denmark fared best, gaining 2 per cent in local currency terms. However,
according to the report, investor interest remained tempered by concerns
over the potential inflationary consequences of the country's relatively
strong economic recovery.
Spanish bonds, the second-best performers, rose 1.86 per cent in local
currency terms following favourable inflation data and easing concern over
the political situation.
French bonds rallied as investors shifted into the more liquid, core markets
in Europe, and were further supported by the Bank of France's latest cut in
its intervention rate to 5 per cent. They rose 1.44 per cent in local
currency terms.
Sweden was the weakest performer, falling by 1.7 per cent in local currency
terms, on a rise in inflation and worries over the outlook for tackling the
government's fiscal deficit as general elections approach. The yield on the
benchmark bond breached 11 per cent.
Italian bonds shed 0.14 per cent as judicial investigations into Prime
Minister Silvio Berlusconi intensified political uncertainty.
Japanese government bonds fell 0.21 per cent on optimism over economic
recovery and fading hopes of another discount rate cut.

FT  02 AUG 94 / International Bonds: GrandMet launches further Dollars 200m
issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The traditional August lull, exaggerated by a holiday in Switzerland,
started yesterday, with only a few new issues launched in a generally
subdued market.
Grand Metropolitan, the UK food and drinks group, added a Dollars 200m
tranche to its Dollars 400m offering of five-year bonds launched in May.
The proceeds of the new issue will be used to repay existing short-term
debt, consisting mainly of commercial paper. 'We wanted to strengthen our
balance sheet by further pushing out the maturity profile of our debt,'
according to a GrandMet treasury official.
The Dollars 400m deal launched in May, the company's debut in the eurodollar
bond market, was also designed to improve the group's name recognition among
European bond investors. GrandMet had previous launched several Yankee bonds
in the US market.
The Dollars 400m issue of eurobonds launched in May at a yield spread of 53
basis points over the comparable Treasury had tightened to around 50 basis
points, where the new tranche was priced. Lead manager Lehman Brothers
reported a mixture of retail and institutional placement.
In Asia's dragon bond market, the Republic of Argentina launched a Dollars
100m three-year issue of floating-rate notes, arranged by Lehman Brothers
and JP Morgan. The notes were priced to offer a discounted margin of 190
basis points over Libor.
The deal, promoted by a roadshow, was designed to gain access for the
borrower to new accounts in Asia. However, most central banks do not have
approval to buy sub-investment grade bonds.
The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission has approved the FT-SE Mid 250
index futures contract traded on the London International Financial Futures
&amp; Options Exchange for sale to US customers. The contract has traded an
average daily volume of 200 contracts since its introduction in February.

FT  02 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: US Shoe rejects Dollars 425m
approach from Nine West
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Shoe, the US footwear, clothing and optical goods group, has received an
unwanted Dollars 425m approach for its footwear business from Nine West,
another US footwear group.
The overture comes barely two months after US Shoe's shareholders voted
against a similar proposal for a break-up of the company from a group of
private investors associated with Mr Alfred Kingsley of Greenway Partners, a
New York money management firm.
Nine West said yesterday it had approached US Shoe last week with a proposal
that US Shoe should spin off its clothing and optical businesses and merge
its footwear business with Nine West's. However, US Shoe's board had
rejected the idea.
Its strategy in publicising details of the approach appears to be aimed at
generating support for the plan from US Shoe's shareholders, so putting
pressure on the company's board to reconsider.
US Shoe is a specialty retailer of women's clothing, optical goods and
footwear with about 2,200 stores and annual sales of about Dollars 2.7bn.
Its lacklustre earnings record has put it under pressure to improve its
performance.
Two months ago US Shoe's board defeated the Greenway Partners proposal by
arguing it would derail actions already being taken to turn the company
around. Yesterday US Shoe said the latest proposal contained the drawbacks
that led to rejection of the earlier plan.
Nine West, which designs and sells women's fashion shoes and has annual
sales of about Dollars 550m, was convinced of the logic of the deal because
of the complementary brands and styles and the opportunities for merging
manufacturing and sourcing.

FT  02 AUG 94 / International Company News: Xerox advances 50% to Dollars
168m in second quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Net income at Xerox, the US document processing company, jumped 50 per cent
in the second quarter to Dollars 168m, or a fully diluted Dollars 1.28 a
share.
In the same quarter a year ago, earnings were Dollars 112m, or 94 cents a
share.
The strong second quarter took first-half net income to Dollars 297m, or
Dollars 2.31 a share, compared with Dollars 301m, or Dollars 2.61, in 1993.
The company said earnings per share growth did not match income growth as
the number of shares outstanding rose during the quarter following a public
offering of 8.1m shares.
An 11 per cent increase in equipment sales to Dollars 1.15bn, and continued
productivity improvements were behind the impressive growth in quarterly
income, said Mr Paul Allaire, chairman and chief execu-tive.
Productivity has been rising because of a restructuring plan recently
implemented by Xerox which aims to reduce the company's worldwide workforce
by more than 10,000 by early 1996.
The growth in equipment sales, meanwhile, is expected to lead to increased
service and supplies revenues.

FT  02 AUG 94 / International Company News: LDDS to pay Dollars 895m for
telecoms group
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LDDS, the acquisitive US telecommunications group, said last night it would
pay about Dollars 895m for IDB Communications of California, an
international satellite-based phone carrier.
The IDB acquisition is an important step for LDDS. LDDS is currently trying
to acquire the WilTel Communications unit of Williams Companies, but so far
Williams has rejected its Dollars 2.5bn offer for WilTel, which operates the
fourth-largest long-distance telecommunications network in the US. The
acquisition of a satellite telecommunications business such as IDB, however,
should strengthen LDDS's hand in its battle to win control of WilTel, say
industry analysts.
Under the terms of a complex stock-for-stock and stock-for-debt agreement,
IDB shareholders will receive at least 0.45 LDDS shares for each IDB share
if LDDS shares are valued at Dollars 22 or more, and at the most 0.52 LDDS
shares for each IDB share if LDDS shares are valued at Dollars 16 or less.
Based on the current LDDS share price of Dollars 19 1/2 , LDDS will pay
about Dollars 700m for IDB stock.
Also, Dollars 195m in convertible subordinated notes issued by IDB will
remain outstanding, and note holders will receive the corresponding exchange
ratio adjustment to their current stock conversion price.
Mr Bernard Ebbers, president and chief executive of LDDS, described the
acquisition as the 'first step' in the company's strategy to 'penetrate the
lucrative segments of the international market'.

FT  02 AUG 94 / International Company News: Foreign banks gain entry to
Mexico
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Twenty foreign banks plan to open up subsidiaries in Mexico this year.
US banks formed the majority of those that applied together with French,
Spanish, German and Japanese banks. No UK bank applied, to the Mexican
government's surprise.
Mexico agreed to open up its banking sector under the North American Free
Trade Agreement. Initially foreign banks are limited to holding 8 per cent
of the sector's total capital, although this limit is increased to 15 per
cent by 1999, and then abolished. Under Nafta rules, all banks not from the
US or Canada have to apply through US or Canadian subsidiaries.
Each bank is limited to 1.5 per cent of the banking capital and, like
Mexican banks, has to make a minimum capital payment of 60m pesos (Dollars
17.6m). Finance ministry officials said last week that only a minority of
banks would apply for the maximum permitted market share.
The government hopes competition from foreign banks will reduce margins
earned by domestic banks, and put pressure on interest rates. Foreign banks
are expected to target the corporate rather than consumer sector.
The banks that sought authorisation are: Bank of Boston, Morgan Stanley,
Bank of Tokyo, Banque National de Paris, Citibank, Chemical Bank, Bank of
America, Chase Manhattan, First Chicago Bank, International Bank of
Commerce, J. P. Morgan, NationsBank, Republic National Bank of New York,
ABM/Amro Bank, Banco de Santander, Societe Generale, American Express, Fuji
Bank, ING Capital Holdings and Dresdner Bank. They will be the first to
offer full services in Mexico, with the exception of Citibank. Finance
ministry officials have said that the banks should receive authorisation in
a month or so, and be operating by the end of the year.

<TEXT>
Mr Ken Cowley, chief executive of News Limited, the Australian arm of Mr
Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, said the media group sees its investment
in John Fairfax, a rival Australian newspaper publisher, as a fairly
short-term holding.
News created a flurry of speculation last month when it disclosed that it
had acquired a 1.7 per cent holding in Fairfax, after the publisher sent out
formal notices requesting details of share trading in mid-June. Fairfax
subsequently confirmed the News holding had risen to more than 2 per cent.
Speaking on television at the weekend, Mr Cowley seemed to downplay the
situation. 'It is a passive investment,' he said. 'I don't see it as long
term.'
Many observers see the ownership situation at Fairfax, whose publications
include the Sydney Morning Herald and the Financial Review, as inherently
unstable. Mr Kerry Packer, the Australian businessman, holds 15 per cent of
the shares, but is unable to go higher under government media
cross-ownership rules, while Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian media tycoon, is
approaching the 25 per cent shareholding limit imposed on foreign investors.

worth Y147bn in July

<TEXT>
Japanese financial institutions sold bad loans totalling Y147.1bn (Dollars
1.46bn) to a joint debt-purchasing agency in July, the Co-operative Credit
Purchasing Corporation (CCPC) announced yesterday.
The company said it paid Y52.1bn for 138 non-performing loans, a discount of
66 per cent to book value.
The CCPC was formed last year to take over problem loans from Japan's banks,
heavily burdened with such loans following the collapse in property prices.
The CCPC removes the loans from company balance sheets and disposes of the
collateral. However, banks lend the money to the CCPC to buy the loans, and
are themselves responsible for the difference between the value of the loan
and the value of the collateral sold.
Since starting operations the company has acquired loans with a total
nominal value of Y4,820bn, and has managed to recover just Y58.9bn, or 1.2
per cent of the value.
The average discount to book value of the loans bought by the CCPC has risen
from 34 per cent in March last year, to the 66 per cent, indicating the
weakness of the Japanese property market.

Moody's, the New York-based rating agency, said it was considering
downgrading the short-term debt ratings of Coles Myer, the Australian retail
group, writes Nikki Tait.
The long-term debt ratings were put under review on July 21, when the
retailer said it would buy back the 21.45 per cent stake in Coles held by
Kmart, the US discount and specialist store group, for around ADollars
1.26bn (USDollars 920m).
Moody's said its review would consider the potential increase in short-term
debt resulting from the buy-back, and any longer-term increase in Coles'
borrowings ratio.

FT  02 AUG 94 / International Company News: Paper-makers feel the heat of a
wild fire - Pulp and paper prices in North America are soaring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This summer is turning out to be most unusual for North American pulp and
paper producers and their customers. Instead of the traditionally quiet
period when markets doze and prices drift, the industry is being swept by an
edginess normally reserved at this time of year for raging forest fires.
One segment of the paper market after another has caught alight. The upward
pressure on prices, which began late last year with wood pulp and packaging
materials such as linerboard and corrugated boxes, has gradually spread to
newsprint and coated papers.
Pulp prices have soared from a low of Dollars 390 a ton a year ago to
Dollars 620. Newsprint mills have successfully pushed through one 7 per cent
price increase, and are about to try another. Producers of uncoated
freesheet (otherwise known as plain white paper) earlier this month
announced their third - and biggest - price increase of the year.
Signs of panic have appeared in some markets. Some pulp and containerboard
suppliers have been forced to ration customers. Containerboard inventories
are close to their lowest level in eight years.
The most recent - and most dramatic - price jump has been for old cardboard
boxes and newspapers, which are required for the rising recycled content of
many grades of paper. Used newspapers fetch about Dollars 120 a ton on the
US east coast, up from Dollars 70 per ton in May.
While collectors of low-grade 'mixed paper' until recently paid recyclers up
to Dollars 20 a ton to take the stuff away, they can now sell this material
for Dollars 50 a ton or more.
Newsprint producers which depend heavily on recycled material, such as
Missouri-based Jefferson Smurfit, have found that the added cost of their
raw materials has virtually wiped out the price increases announced so far
this year.
A recovery in paper prices comes as no surprise given the rebound in the
North American economy.
Improved business conditions have pushed up newspaper and magazine
advertising lineage, as well as use of packaging materials and some business
paper grades. US daily newspapers' consumption of newsprint was 6.1 per cent
higher in June than a year earlier.
'The industry goes that way - from feast to famine,' says Mr Doug Young, a
US paper consultant.
But a number of special factors are also at work in this upswing. Paper
prices sank to their lowest levels in decades during the 1991-93 recession,
forcing several dozen mills to shut.
'Prices haven't been high enough to justify capacity expansions in many
cases,' says Mr John Maine, analyst with Resource Information Systems, a
Virginia consultancy. Canada's chemical pulp mills were operating full tilt
at 107 per cent of capacity last month, up from 89 per cent in May.
Furthermore, many customers are nervous that labour-contract talks under way
at British Columbia's pulp and paper mills will break down later this
summer, leading to a strike. Mr Wayne Mangels, director of market research
at Bowater's US subsidiary, says the newsprint market, which is roughly in
balance, would be deprived of about 35,000 tonnes of newsprint a week in the
event of a strike there.
The weak US and Canadian dollars, coupled with strong overseas demand, has
further tightened domestic markets by encouraging exports.
According to the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, Canadian mills shipped
364,700 tonnes of newsprint to Asian countries in the first five months of
1994, 29 per cent more than last year. Pulp exports to Japan surged by 46
per cent in the first half of the year.
Japan is also one of the countries whose appetite for wastepaper has helped
create the shortage in North America.
In spite of the price increases and supply shortages, few companies are
thinking of installing new capacity. 'Nobody has made enough money,' says Mr
Bruce Kirk, analyst at SG Warburg in New York. Most companies are expected
to wait until the recovery is on a more solid footing.
Several deals in the pipeline could provide a glimpse of the investment
outlook. The industry will take a close interest in the price Scott Paper is
able to negotiate for SD Warren, the world's largest maker of coated
free-sheet paper, which Scott has put up for sale.
A number of prospective buyers are also hovering around a newsprint mill at
Bear Island, Virginia.
On the other hand, investment in recycling plants is booming as
environmental laws require paper-makers to raise the recycled content of
their products.
According to the American Forest and Paper Association, US paper producers
have 56 new recycling projects on the drawing boards. The industry's
consumption of recovered paper has jumped by about a third in the past four
years to 29.2m tons in 1993.
The commissioning of so much recycling capacity raises fears, however, that
the present shortage of old paper will seem insignificant compared with the
scramble in a few years' time.
Bowater's Mr Mangel estimates that about 65 per cent of used papers will
need to be recovered within the next five years to meet demand, compared
with around 50 per cent now. 'It could become a disaster,' he says.
As a result, access to old newspapers, cardboard boxes and other wastepaper
has become one of the North American industry's most pressing commercial and
political concerns.

FT  02 AUG 94 / International Company News: Two US regional banks to merge
in pooling deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Two North Carolina-based banks announced a merger to create a south-east
regional grouping with assets of Dollars 18bn, signalling a rare merger of
equals among US banks.
The pace of bank takeovers in the US has slowed as acquirers have been
forced to pay ever higher premiums. By accounting for their deal as a
pooling of interests, BB&amp;T Financial and Southern National yesterday
announced a deal in which neither company's shareholders will pay a premium
for control.
The deal, which creates a bank with market capitalisation of more than
Dollars 2bn, also signals the growing pressure on banks in the south-east
caused by the likely passage of interstate banking legislation.
Until now, banks in the region have been protected from takeover by
institutions from elsewhere in the US by the so-called South-Eastern
Compact, a series of loose agreements between states. The compact is already
breaking down under new legislation passed by individual states over the
past year, including North Carolina, and will dissolve when the remaining
barriers to takeovers are removed by the proposed federal legislation.
Mr John Allison, chairman and chief executive of BB&amp;T and of the merged
company, said the merger was in part a response to interstate banking, which
was likely to lead to more competition.
The two banks predicted annual cost savings of Dollars 50m. Mr Glenn Orr,
head of Southern National, said he would give up his executive duties but
keep a seat on the board. Past attempts by banks to share management power
'helps to perpetuate an atmosphere of separate banks and creates confusion
among employees,' he said.

interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Earnings from recent purchases of three Hong Kong companies helped to boost
the first-half profits at Malayan United Industries (MUI), the
Malaysian-based conglomerate with interests ranging from hotels to cement
trading and financial services to news-papers.
Profits in the six months to the end of June advanced 61 per cent to
MDollars 38.37m (USDollars 14.79m) from MDollars 23.89m a year earlier, on
turnover substantially lower at MDollars 222.4m, against MDollars 347.37m.
Pre-tax profits of MDollars 57.28m compared with MDollars 47.18m in the
first half of 1993.
The group recently acquired substantial stakes in Hong Kong-based South
China Morning Post (Holdings), Kerry Financial Services, and Morning Star
Holdings to boost its international investment division. It went on a buying
spree after selling off its MUI Bank and MUI Finance to Malaysia's Hong
Leong group for MDollars 1.1bn cash.
MUI said contributions from the group's cement-based associated companies
also improved with the increased production capacity of the cement plants.

Texas Instruments of the US and Hitachi of Japan have agreed to form a joint
venture to build a Dollars 500m semiconductor chip plant in Texas. It will
be the first joint venture semiconductor manufacturing facility in the US.
The companies announced plans to begin construction of the plant next year,
with production to begin in 1996. The plant will produce 16 and 64 megabit
dynamic random-access memory chips (D-Rams) - the next two generations of
data storage chips for use in a broad variety of computer and consumer
electronics products.
TI and Hitachi will hold a majority equity stake in the joint venture and
plan to seek equity investments from other parties. All products produced at
the plant will go directly to TI and Hitachi for sale to their customers.
The joint venture is subject to regulatory approval in the US.
The joint venture follows six years of research and development
collaboration between TI and Hitachi on successive generations of memory
chips.
Rising costs have led to several collaborative efforts in the memory chip
business including another TI joint venture with Acer of Taiwan.

FT  02 AUG 94 / International Company News: Ted Turner expresses interest in
buying CBS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ted Turner, chairman of Turner Broadcasting System, the cable television
group, yesterday said he was interested in buying CBS. His comments
intensified speculation over the future of the US television broadcasting
network.
However, Mr Turner also said he would be interested in acquiring either of
the other two main US networks, ABC and NBC.
Speaking in St Petersburg, Russia, where he is attending the Goodwill Games,
Mr Turner said a merger between Turner Broadcasting - which owns various
cable stations in the US, including CNN - and one of the big three broadcast
networks would make good business sense. 'It's very, very logical for us to
be in that business.'
He said a merger with CBS would be especially attractive. 'It'd give us a
network. We'd be in the same position that ABC is with ESPN in sports. We
would have both cable networks and a broadcast network.' Mr Turner remarked
that Turner could afford to buy CBS.
'One reason we're being taken seriously is our market capitalisation varies
between a low of Dollars 8bn and a high of Dollars 9bn or Dollars 10bn in
the last year, and CBS was just over Dollars 5bn before they did their
buy-back.'
Although Mr Turner told reporters he had no plans at the moment to bid for a
network, his comments lifted CBS shares Dollars 2 3/4 to close at Dollars
314 3/4 on Wall Street, where traders and investors have been speculating in
recent weeks over whether CBS would be acquired by another company.
That speculation was sparked by the collapse in mid-July of the network's
planned Dollars 7.1bn merger with QVC, the home-shopping television channel
run by Mr Barry Diller, the entertainment industry executive.
The deal with QVC fell through after the cable systems company Comcast, a
big QVC shareholder which had been unhappy about the planned merger with
CBS, unexpectedly launched a rival bid for the home-shopping channel.
Although Mr Laurence Tisch, CBS's chairman, insisted after the merger's
collapse that his network was not for sale, industry analysts said the
company was vulnerable to a hostile bid from a big US entertainment group.
Among the possible suitors mentioned were the Walt Disney group,
Tele-Communications, the large cable group, and Turner Broadcasting.
CBS has the highest-rated programmes on US television among the big three
networks. However, a series of setbacks this year - including the loss of
the rights to televise American football games to Mr Rupert Murdoch's Fox
network, and the defection of several important affiliate stations, also to
Fox - has damaged morale and led to renewed criticism of Mr Tisch's
management.
In particular, Mr Tisch has been attacked for maintaining CBS as a pure
television broadcasting business, and not diversifying, like ABC and NBC,
into the rapidly-expanding cable television market.

says Iri boss

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Stet, the Italian state telecommunications holding company, could be
privatised as soon as this autumn, Mr Michele Tedeschi, the former managing
director, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Rome.
'I hope that the programme to start Stet's privatisation this autumn can be
respected,' said Mr Tedeschi, who took over yesterday as chairman of Iri,
the state holding company and Stet's parent.
He said the sale would take place after the launch of Telecom Italia, the
company that will be formed from the merger of Italy's five domestic
telecoms groups, this month.
Analysts value Stet at L27,000bn-L30,000bn (Dollars 16.8bn-Dollars 18.7bn).
Meanwhile, Stet said it expected group income this year to rise about 9 per
cent from last year's L29,800bn.
It said the operating result this year would be more than 19 per cent of its
1994 income. Stet only gave percentage increases. However, they would work
out to L32,480bn for turnover and an operating result of L6,170bn up from
L5,250bn for the same period last year.
The group forecast net debt would fall to under L20,000bn in 1994 from
L22,000bn last year.

Dofasco, Canada's leading steel maker, continued its recovery in the second
quarter with higher prices for flat rolled products, higher shipments and
lower unit costs.
The company has negotiated a 1995 price increase of 15 per cent to 20 per
cent in Canadian dollar terms with Chrysler, and has begun negotiations with
General Motors.
The company is seeking similar increases with the appliance industry.
Second-quarter operating net profit was CDollars 35.3m (USDollars 25.4m), or
36 cents a common share, against CDollars 6.7m a year earlier, which was
absorbed by preferred stock dividends. After special gains, the latest
quarter showed final net profit of CDollars 99.3m, or CDollars 1.21 a share.
Revenues were CDollars 557m, up 3 per cent.
First-half net profit was CDollars 103.7m, or Dollars 1.10 a share,
including special items, against a loss of CDollars 5.8m, or 24 cents, on
sales of CDollars 1.09bn, against CDollars 1.06bn.
Average selling price for hot rolled steel was CDollars 644 a tonne, up from
CDollars 614 in the first quarter, and is expected to reach about CDollars
660 by the year end. Cost per tonne was CDollars 529, against CDollars 548
in the first quarter.

Operating profits at Bayerische Hypotheken-und Wechsel-Bank stagnated at
DM483m (Dollars 296m) during the first six months of the year in spite of a
15 per cent increase in interest income to almost DM2bn.
Earnings from own-account trading were down 83 per cent to DM14m in
comparison with the first half of last year. But partial operating profits,
which exclude this factor, rose 14 per cent to DM930m.
Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank last week reported large declines in earnings
from their own-account trading activities, but while they managed to reduce
debt provisions, Hypo-Bank set aside DM571m, almost 16 per cent more.
Net commission income rose 5 per cent on the year-earlier figure to DM442m,
and strong demand for housing was reflected in a 29 per cent surge to DM733m
in net interest income from its mortgage business, in which average interest
margins rose to 1.03 per cent compared with 0.99 per cent throughout 1993.
Interest income from general banking, where margins narrowed slightly to
1.89 per cent from 1.90 per cent, was 9 per cent higher at DM1.265bn.
Yesterday's interim report was the first in which Hypo-Bank presented direct
comparisons with the comparable part of the previous year.
On the basis of German banks' traditional reporting methods - comparing
half-year results with 50 per cent of the full 1993 outcome - full operating
profits were down 6.6 per cent, and partial earnings were 3.6 per cent
higher.
On this basis, risk provisions were down 1 per cent. The difference between
this figure and the direct comparison with the first half of 1993 reflects
in part the impact of the collapse of the Jurgen Schneider property
business. According to recent statements, the bank set aside about DM150m to
cover its share of the risk.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banque Nationale de Paris and Lazard Freres are to be appointed as advisers
to Renault for the partial or full privatisation of the state-owned car
group.
The mandate to advise the company is one of the most prestigious in the
French government's plan to privatise 21 public-sector groups. Renault is
valued at more than FFr40bn (Dollars 7.1bn), although a report last week by
Lehman Brothers gave a valuation of FFr55bn to FFr60bn.
The centre-right government of Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, is
weighing the sale of part or all of its 80 per cent stake in Renault. It
will appoint adviser banks, but a decision is not expected before Friday at
the earliest.
BNP and Lazards have close relations with Renault. Mr Louis Schweitzer,
Renault's chairman, sits on BNP's board, while the car group is a member of
BNP's noyau dur of long-term stable shareholders. Lazards advised Renault
during its ultimately unsuccessful negotiations with Volvo of Sweden
concerning the merger of the two groups.
The French government has yet to decide how and when Renault's capital will
be opened to investors.
However, many industry observers believe a partial privatisation, with
stakes being taken by financial and industrial partners, could occur this
year.

Incentive, a leading industrial arm of the Sweden's Wallenberg family, has

Bilsom to the French group Christian Dalloz, writes Christopher Brown-Humes
in Stockholm.
Bilsom, which has a SKr400m (Dollars 51.5m) annual turnover and 400
employees, is a leading supplier of protective equipment such as ear plugs,
respiratory masks and safety glasses. The financial details were not
disclosed.
Incentive acquired control of Cardo in June after launching a SKr8.4bn bid
for the group, which was formerly 44 per cent owned by Volvo.
The deal expands the personal safety equipment business of Christian Dalloz,
a quoted company with annual turnover of SKr650m.

FT  02 AUG 94 / International Company News: Olympic swallows its medicine -
The Greek airline needs time to regain its strength
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Dr54bn (Dollars 219m) capital injection for Olympic Airways from the
state, approved last week by the European Commission, offers the loss-making
Greek national carrier what may be its last chance of survival.
The conditions attached to the aid, which includes a debt write-off
amounting to Dr491bn, are stringent but considerably more generous than
those first proposed.
Olympic has managed to retain its profitable monopoly of ground handling
operations at Greek airports, holding off a challenge from several big
European airlines, while it carries out a three-year restructuring plan.
It is being allowed to keep open its loss-making long-haul routes to New
York and Sydney, which mainly serve diaspora Greek communities. These routes
are seen as essential for maintaining links with about 4m Greeks living
overseas.
However, the carrier's future depends as much on severing links with the
government - which sets ticket prices, approves loans to the airline and
appoints its senior management - and improving service to customers as on
cost-cutting to reduce operating losses projected at Dr24bn this year.
'The debt write-off will make a big difference to Olympic's financial
position, but the real difficulty will come in implementing change in
management practices,' said Mr Stefanos Romaios, a senior Olympic official.
Greece's high interest rates, together with penalty charges amounting to
about 3 per cent a month on overdue government loans, last year swelled
financial charges to about Dr123bn, equivalent to 90 per cent of the
airline's overall losses for 1993.
Under the airline's restructuring plan, prepared in co-operation with
Avmark, the international aviation consultants, Olympic should show a net
profit of Dr14bn next year. This should rise to Dr30bn in 1997, equipping
Olympic to face competition both in ground handling and on domestic routes
to 25 Greek islands at the end of the following year.
Cost-cutting, directed mainly at labour costs, which account for almost 50
per cent of the airline's operating outlays, is to be the priority.
A two-year wage freeze, together with a voluntary retirement programme for
1,900 of 9,900 employees and more flexible working rules, should reduce
labour costs by more than 40 per cent in the next two years.
Asset disposals, including the sale of one Boeing 747 and the return to
lessors of four Airbus A300s, will reduce the airline's fleet to 31
passenger jets, while additional savings will come from cutting long-haul
routes to Tokyo and Chicago.
The airline's trade unions accept that reforms are needed to prevent Olympic
shutting down. But details of the plan agreed with the Commission still
await approval. The pilots' union, for example, must be persuaded to agree
to suspension of seniority-linked holidays and a reduction in medical
benefits.
'The unions must be brought on board immediately if restructuring is to
succeed,' says one local analyst. 'Because successive governments changed
the airline's top management so frequently, the unions now in effect control
Olympic's day-to-day operations.'
Under the terms of the Commission's approval for Olympic's capital increase,
the three tranches of funding, due to start with a Dr19bn capital injection
in 1995, will be released only if the airline keeps to the restructuring
timetable.
Moreover, the carrier will not be entitled to any more state funding.
Reform will mean cutting through the carrier's management layers, considered
a crucial step towards eliminating government interference in Olympic's
operations and introducing flexible decision-making. Outside consultants are
to be appointed to oversee changes in planning and organisation.
Freeing ticket prices and improving marketing, including co-operative
agreements with other international airlines, will help to lift revenues.
Olympic faces increasingly aggressive competition from two new private Greek
airlines and charter operators, which now carry 66 per cent of international
traffic to Greece, mainly in the summer months.
However, the Commission's insistence that Olympic should not increase its
total seat capacity for the next three years will place constraints on
growth.
The airline sees its future in expanding routes to eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union and upgrading services in the eastern Mediterranean,
where it is the leading regional carrier.
'Olympic is being put in a plaster cast for the next three years,' Mr
Romaios said. 'It should be cured when it comes out, but will it be strong
enough to survive in a much more competitive environment?'

FT  02 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Caparo close to US steelmaking purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Caparo Group, the privately-owned UK steel and engineering concern,
confirmed yesterday it was close to making its biggest acquisition to date
by buying most of the steelmaking assets of Pennsylvania-based Sharon
Specialty Steel.
Mr Swraj Paul, the Anglo-Indian businessman who founded and chairs Caparo,
said the company had signed a letter of intent to buy Sharon, which is
operating under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code.
Terms were not disclosed, but Caparo hopes to reach a definitive agreement
on the purchase by September 4, with final closing set for November 1.
Sharon would trade as a new US subsidiary, Caparo Steel.
If the deal goes through, it would transform the shape and size of Caparo
Group, turning it into a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) company through the
combination of Dollars 400m of sales from Sharon and the current worldwide
total of Pounds 360m.
Caparo has already made acquisitions in the US steel industry, but Mr Paul
said the takeover 'is a vehicle to become somebody in steel in the US'. The
timing of the deal was good, he said, with the strength of the US steel
market, and 'steel is a business we know inside out'.
Sharon has been in the court-administered Chapter 11 process since November
1992 and had undertaken to find a buyer by August 31 this year.
Caparo would initially operate Sharon's electric furnace, blooming mill and
hot strip mill with 450 unionised hourly workers and 90 salaried people. It
aims to be producing 1m tonnes per year of hot-rolled high and low carbon
steel in the second year of operations. Caparo will invest Dollars 15m to
help finance start-up activities and make initial productivity improvements.
Ultimately, Caparo said it would further invest sufficient capital to
develop Caparo Steel as a 'low cost' competitive producer.

FT  02 AUG 94 / UK Company News: GEC-Marconi sells LNB offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gooding Consumer Electronics, a privately-owned Welsh company, and Grundig
of Germany have bought GEC-Marconi's LNB Division, which makes a component
for the reception of satellite television.
The price has not been disclosed but Mr Alfred Gooding, chairman of GCE,
said it was substantial.
The division makes low noise blocks, which convert the microwave signals
collected by a satellite dish to a lower frequency signal. This then goes by
cable to a receiver which provides the television's sound and pictures.
LNB Division is claimed to be the UK market leader in the manufacture of low
noise blocks and to have a third of the European market. It will be renamed
Gooding Microwave Technology and the intention is to continue to supply and
expand its customer base. GCE has 70 per cent of the new company and Grundig
30 per cent.
Earlier this year, GCE and Grundig, in which Philips, the Dutch electronics
company, has a large stake, set up Grundig Satellite Communications. The
joint venture makes satellite television receivers at Llantrisant in south
Wales and is already claiming to have 15 per cent of the UK market.
Mr Gooding described the acquisition as 'a logical progression' of the
launch of GSC. 'The purchase is part of our strategy to build a fully
integrated business in consumer electronics,' he said.
Gooding Microwave Technology will employ the existing 35 staff of LNB
Division and continue 'for a limited period' at the present base in
Borehamwood, Hertfordshire.

172,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Corporate Services Group, the USM-quoted employment services and training
concern, lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 32,000 to Pounds 172,000 in the
first half of 1994.
Turnover rose from Pounds 16.1m to Pounds 30.9m, including a contribution
from the training division, acquired in the second half of last year, of
Pounds 6.3m.
The result follows a return to profit of Pounds 877,000 (Pounds 1.55m loss)
in 1993.
Mr Jeffrey Fowler, chairman, said there had been a further strengthening
within the UK market of both areas in which the group operated.
With the market expected to continue in its current form it was expected
that the group would 'perform very well in the second half, leading to a
substantial enhancement in our earnings per share,' he added.
He said that performance of the three acquisitions had been in line with
expectations and he expected them to make asignificant contribution in the
second half.
Operating profits were Pounds 384,000 (Pounds 162,000), including Pounds
90,000 from training. Earnings per share improved to 0.44p (0.11p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Seacon Holdings, the USM-quoted shipping and distribution group, reported a
decline in pre-tax profits from Pounds 818,000 to Pounds 437,000 on turnover
ahead from Pounds 9.09m to Pounds 9.54m for the six months to end-March.
Mr Chris Roth, chairman, said that the outcome had been affected by the
development of the new terminal at Tower Wharf in Northfleet, Kent. Net
interest receivable had been halved to Pounds 155,000, reflecting capital
expenditure on the project and lower interest rates.
Because of disruption caused by the construction work, Seacon had incurred
additional costs relating to the short-term hire of warehousing and plant as
well as the employment of temporary additional staff in order to discharge
ships and move cargo by inefficient methods, Mr Roth said.
Although the new terminal was completed just before the period end, it would
take a while to get it operating at maximum efficiency, he added.
Earnings per share emerged at 1.18p (2.25p) and the interim dividend is
increased to 0.97p, against 0.92p adjusted for the 5-for-2 share split in
March. A recommended final of not less than 1.36p is forecast.

FT  02 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Exceptional costs hit Andrews Sykes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLARE GASCOIGNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Restructuring will continue to depress Andrews Sykes, the specialist
industrial services group which yesterday announced a fall into the red for
the year to end-March.
Exceptional items of Pounds 4.12m, half of which related to the disposal of
non-core businesses, resulted in a pre-tax loss of Pounds 4.74m, against
profits of Pounds 1.27m.
Mr Eric Hook, appointed chief executive on May 12 following a boardroom
coup, said further rationalisation and reorganisation costs 'will adversely
affect the results for the year to March 1995'.
Turnover fell 6 per cent, from Pounds 56.2m to Pounds 52.9m. Operating
profits dropped from Pounds 4.2m to Pounds 1.2m; only Pounds 200,000 of this
was generated in the UK, compared with Pounds 3.4m the previous year.
Exceptional losses on the disposal of two subsidiaries - Centahire, the
small tool hire business based in the north-east, and Kocoverk, the 51 per
cent owned Swedish group - amounted to Pounds 2.05m. Other exceptional items
included redundancy costs of Pounds 670,000 (Pounds 844,000); a property
write-down of Pounds 891,000; a stock and other asset write-off of Pounds
367,000 and other exceptional costs of Pounds 140,000.
Mr Hook said further asset disposals and a cost reduction programme would be
necessary to reduce year-end gearing of 256 per cent. Since then the company
has closed a centralised pump repair facility in Tipton, West Midlands, and
withdrawn from Hungary.
'There is now a need to refocus management attention on the group's core
activities of pumping, heating and air-conditioning and, in particular, the
UK-based hire business,' he said.
Losses per share were 40.6p (0.5p), and no final dividend is proposed (3p,
totalling 4.4p for the year). Although the group was able in May to pay
arrears of dividend on the convertible preference shares of 7p per share,
payment due in June was again deferred.

FT  02 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Brandon Hire returns to dividend list
despite loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Brandon Hire, which hires power tools, catering equipment and marquees,
resumed dividend payments in spite of a pre-tax loss of Pounds 12,000 for
the year to end April, compared with a Pounds 14,000 deficit last time.
A final dividend of 1.5p is payable from earnings, enhanced by a tax credit,
of 0.63p (0.44p) per share.
Losses were struck after an exceptional provision of Pounds 200,000 against
four unsettled claims arising from the provisional liquidation of the
company's insurers. The provision was included in increased administrative
expenses of Pounds 3.29m (Pounds 2.77m).
Turnover was ahead 17 per cent at Pounds 4.54m (Pounds 3.87m), with a 28 per
cent improvement in the second half after a poor start.
The USM-quoted company is to seek a full listing and will change its April
year end to December.

FT  02 AUG 94 / UK Company News: The sky's no limit for Mr Gooding - A look
at GCE's latest satellite TV equipment venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The City thinks anyone going into brown goods is bonkers,' said Mr Alfred
Gooding. 'But we in Europe have to compete with the Far East and America,
and with modern techniques and investment, I believe it is possible to do
so.'
Mr Gooding, a Welsh entrepreneur in his early 60s, was speaking of Gooding
Consumer Electronics, a private company formed 14 months ago by himself and
Mr Koen van Driel, a Dutch businessman.
Based in south Wales, GCE is seeking to reverse the trend of recent years by
becoming a leading British group in the sector.
Last December, GCE paid FFr160m (Pounds 18.5m) to take over a French
television factory owned by Grundig, the German consumer electronics
manufacturer. In March, it set up an Pounds 8m joint venture with Grundig to
make satellite television receivers in Wales.
In its latest move to create an integrated operation, it was announced
yesterday that GCE had again joined forces with Grundig to acquire
GEC-Marconi's LNB Division, which makes a vital component for satellite
reception. The division will be renamed Gooding Microwave Technology.
Mr Gooding is gambling - with Pounds 18m of his own money - on his judgment
that a UK-based consumer electronics business can be competitive with those
in east Asia. Far fewer components, he said, were now needed to make
electronic products. This had drastically cut assembly time and labour
costs.
In addition, European retailers buying from east Asia had the disadvantage
of working to a long timescale from order to delivery. 'We are confident we
can provide better quality service than competitors and alter designs far
quicker to meet the demands of the market,' he said.
The French television factory, which Grundig wanted to close to consolidate
manufacture elsewhere, has the capacity to make more than 1m sets a year.
GCE is designing low-cost small-screen models and the plant will start
deliveries in November.
As part of the acquisition, GCE purchased two brand names: Minerva from
Grundig and Continental Edison from Thomson. Products will sell under these
names on the Continent and under the Grundig label in the UK and Ireland.
Grundig Satellite Communications, the joint venture with Grundig, is chaired
by Mr Gooding with Mr van Driel as managing director. GCE owns 70 per cent
and Grundig, which has two directors on the board, 30 per cent.
While the venture itself is new, Mr Gooding and Mr van Driel have much
experience of satellite television equipment. Mr Gooding is chairman of Race
Electronics, the contract manufacturer which makes own-label receivers. Mr
van Driel, an ex-managing director of Grundig UK, is a former commercial
director of Societe Europeene des Satellites - owner and operator of the
Astra satellite system.
'I recognised I didn't have the experience with European manufacture,' Mr
Gooding said, 'and with his background he could set up a sales and marketing
network to compete with the Far East.'
'We concentrated on the design and then started discussions with Grundig,'
Mr van Driel said. 'Our proposition was that if we joined forces we could
have a pragmatic approach with down-to-earth designs. For many large
organisations that is not simple - there is a culture of being
over-engineered.
'We could offer efficient production with our background of contract
manufacture, experienced management and a very respected brand name in
Grundig, which has a large resource of research and development expertise
and a strong distribution network.'
Production began in April at Llantrisant, in Mid Glamorgan - Mr Gooding is a
strong advocate of the merits of a Welsh labour force. A Pounds 3m
advertising campaign aims to challenge the market leaders, Amstrad and Pace,
and, more indirectly, cable television.
In the UK, the GSC range starts at Pounds 199. 'We believe the consumer will
be less and less prepared to pay a hefty premium for a brand name,' Mr van
Driel said.
The target is to capture, within three years, between 25 and 30 per cent of
the UK market of about 900,000 units. The company claims to have already
reached half of that target. Over the three years, it expects to build up to
an annual production of 1m units, with the Llantrisant workforce increasing
from 200 to 600. About two thirds of this output is intended to be exported
to continental Europe, India and east Asia, and the Americas.
Mr Gooding's confidence is undiluted. 'We will have a turnover of Pounds
150m in 1995. There are no two ways about it.'

FT  02 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Ashtead advances to Pounds 7m as prices and
demand rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Ashtead Group rose 21p to 383p yesterday after the plant and
machinery rental company said it had defied the recession with a sharp
increase in full year profits.
Rising prices and buoyant demand for hire equipment helped the company lift
pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.8m to Pounds 7m for the year to April 30 on
turnover of Pounds 43.8m (Pounds 33.9m).
Mr Peter Lewis, chairman, said the group was reaping the benefits of heavy
investment in the UK rental business, which totalled Pounds 13m during the
year to take spending since 1990 to Pounds 40.7m.
'These results are reward for the policy of investing during a recession in
people, plant and facilities. The downturn has also given us opportunities
by crushing so many competitors,' he said.
Since the depths of the recession, which reduced the value of the hire
equipment industry from an estimated Pounds 750m to Pounds 450m, Ashtead
claimed it had doubled its market share to 8 per cent and was well-placed to
expand further.
Expansion plans centre on A-Plant, the UK hire division, which dominated the
improved group performance by contributing operating profits of Pounds 5.8m
(Pounds 2.71m) on turnover ahead 28 per cent at Pounds 34.4m.
Mr Lewis said the group hoped to double its presence across the country to
about 150 outlets through acquisitions and by opening greenfield sites. He
also predicted accelerated growth in the US, where the Sunbelt Rentals
subsidiary saw operating profits rise fivefold to Pounds 809,000.
Ashtead Technology, the offshore services division, reported a more modest
6.5 per cent increase in operating profits to Pounds 792,000. But Mr Lewis
said it was a creditable result given the slowdown in North Sea oil and gas
production and the decision to close its sales business to concentrate
solely on rental operations.
Earnings per share more than doubled to 20.8p (9.4p) and a final dividend of
4.2p is recommended, making a total of 5.5p (4.538p).
COMMENT
Ashtead has set itself tough targets. The company aims to return to the
halcyon pre-recession days when operating margins exceeded 30 per cent. It
could do it. The construction industry is showing signs of an upturn; first
quarter sales are up 55 per cent and operating margins have risen to 16.9
per cent. With contributions likely from new acquisitions and Pounds 5.6m of
net cash left after last year's rights issue, the company looks set fair.
Profits this year are expected to reach Pounds 10.5m, which makes the shares
worth considering on a forward multiple of 14.5.

FT  02 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Ladbroke eyes casinos business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ladbroke, the hotels, betting and DIY group, could agree to buy three
casinos by the end of this month - 15 years after being forced out of the
business for what a court called 'disgraceful' behaviour.
Ladbroke is thought to be three weeks away from concluding a Pounds 50m deal
to buy three London casinos from Mr Trevor Hemmings, the leisure operator.
The group will not know until after the deal is concluded, however, whether
it will get Gaming Board approval to run them.
Ladbroke could continue to run the establishments under their existing
licences on a temporary basis, but will then require a new certificate of
consent from the Gaming Board, confirming that it is a fit and proper
company to run the casinos.
Ladbroke lost three of its casino licences in 1979 after allegations about
the way in which it had attempted to win business from rivals.
The retirement of Mr Cyril Stein as Ladbroke chairman at the beginning of
this year, however, opened the way for the group to attempt to re-enter the
casino business. Mr Peter George, Ladbroke's new chief executive, has made
no secret of his desire to run casinos once again, alongside its hotel and
betting operations.
The group has said it wants to sell off its property division. While it is
continuing to improve the management of its Texas Homecare DIY chain,
Ladbroke does not see itself as a retailer in the long term.
Mr Hemmings' clubs would provide Ladbroke with a good spread of casino
business. Maxims is aimed at high-spenders, the Golden Horseshoe at the
middle market, and Charlie Chester's at small gamblers.

FT  02 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Abbey National aided by drop in provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A steep fall in provisions for bad and doubtful debts largely accounted for
the 41 per cent increase in pre-tax profits at Abbey National, the home
loans and banking group, from Pounds 301m to Pounds 423m in the six months
to June 30.
Provisions in UK retail banking fell to Pounds 26m, against Pounds 78m in
the first half of 1993, while provisions for the group's continental
European and offshore operations fell to Pounds 15m (Pounds 81m).
Pre-tax profits in UK retail banking rose by 5 per cent to Pounds 314m
(Pounds 300m), but there was a sharper rise in profit from the group's life
insurance operations to Pounds 47m (Pounds 18m).
At 9.8 per cent of the UK net mortgage lending market in the first half of
this year, Abbey's market share was lower than usual.
Mr Peter Birch, chief executive, said that in the early part of the year,
when fixed-rate mortgages had been popular and had carried very slim
margins, Abbey had deliberately not competed aggressively.
Since then the emphasis had shifted back towards variable rates and Abbey's
success would show through in market share figures for the second half of
the year.
But both he and Lord Tugendhat, chairman, underlined that the company wanted
to be 'judged on profitability, not by market share'.
Abbey's share of the UK retail savings market was an estimated 14 per cent,
following a marketing drive, but this could slip back in the second half.
Pre-tax profits from the treasury operation were just 6 per cent ahead at
Pounds 70m (Pounds 66m), while there was a 33 per cent increase in average
assets.
Abbey intends to apply to the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US
later this year for registration of public funding issues.
Group net interest margin fell to 1.6 per cent (1.86 per cent) and net
interest income slipped to Pounds 642m (Pounds 645m), but Mr Birch resisted
the suggestion that there was pressure on margins. He pointed to the growth
in the treasury operation where margins were smaller, and said that overall
margins after provisioning had been fairly flat for some time. Abbey had
'demonstrated that we are able to manage that margin fairly well'.
Abbey said its continental European operations now centred on the mortgage
lending operation in Italy and a refocused banking operation in Spain.
Nationwide Building Society, the UK's second largest, said yesterday that it
had acquired from Lehman Brothers a Pounds 70m mortgage book made up of 940
UK residential mortgages.

FT  02 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Restructured Dunton in the black
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dunton Group, the USM-quoted company with interests in brickmaking,
engineering and property, returned to profit after a restructuring for the
11 months to April 30.
Restated pre-tax profit was Pounds 3.8m, compared with a loss of Pounds
4.94m for the previous 12 months. However, ignoring the effect of the
restructuring, the company returned a loss before interest and tax of Pounds
15,000 (Pounds 2.6m).
The restructuring involved a 1-for-3 rights issue which raised Pounds
760,000, the sale of various group companies and their debt, and a
rearrangement with Dunton's bankers. It left the company with net assets of
Pounds 601,000, compared with negative net assets of Pounds 4.02m at May 31
1993.
Mr David Williams, chairman, said the board planned a reduction of capital
to eliminate the profit and loss deficit, and also intended to apply for a
full listing.
Earnings per share were 7.7p (losses 8.9p).

Bridon, the wire rope and engineering products manufacturer, has bought the
wire rope distribution and lifting equipment hire business of George Craig &amp;
Sons for a cash consideration based on net assets of about Pounds 7.5m and a
goodwill premium not exceeding Pounds 1m.
Operating profit for the three new businesses, which will continue to trade

FT  02 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Caverdale expands to Pounds 1.3m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Caverdale Group, the motor retailing and industrial products concern, nearly
doubled pre-tax profits, from Pounds 663,000 to Pounds 1.28m, in the six
months to June 30.
Turnover advanced from Pounds 21.6m to Pounds 48.3m of which acquisitions
accounted for Pounds 14.3m (Pounds 7.86m).
The industrial products division had a strong six months, and Mr Arild
Nerdrum, chairman, said he believed the outlook for the retail motor
industry was more positive than at any time since Caverdale entered the
sector. He expected further substantial growth in the second half.
The group completed the Godfrey Davis acquisition yesterday and Mr Nerdrum
said the acquisition, which marks Caverdale's first involvement with Ford,
would add about Pounds 70m to turnover in a full year.
An interim dividend of 0.1p is being paid from earnings per share of 0.55p
(0.46p).

FT  02 AUG 94 / UK Company News: NatWest seeks to excite City - The bank
hopes its results will ignite its shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When National Westminster Bank announces interim results this morning, its
directors will hope they bring about a change of mood. Despite a strong
recovery in earnings and a general respect for its management, the bank has
struggled without much success to excite the stock market.
The frustrations of its share price having lagged behind Barclays since its
rival appointed Mr Martin Taylor as chief executive show. 'We have done the
revolutionary things Martin Taylor talks about, the things no-one is
supposed to have done before,' says Mr Derek Wanless, NatWest's chief
executive.
Apart from being perceived as a less dramatic recovery story than Barclays,
NatWest has suffered from a relatively meagre 6 per cent dividend increase
last year. This compared poorly with banks such as Lloyds and Royal Bank of
Scotland which had stronger capital ratios, and paid more.
It contributed to a 24 per cent fall in its share price in the year to
mid-July. Lord Alexander, NatWest's chairman, nonetheless defends the logic
of the decision.
'It did not go down very well, but as someone said at the time, that said
more about the market than (about) what we did.'
The signs are that NatWest will attempt to reassure the market this morning
with a bigger rise. Lord Alexander told the annual meeting that bad debt
provisions were falling faster than expected, and that uncertainty over
provisions was one reason for previous caution.
'Our general philosophy is that the dividend sends a signal for the future
in terms of confidence, but we also believe it should be firmly covered,' he
says. The dividend was 1.9 times covered at the full year, but was not cut
during the bank's worst year of 1991, and was uncovered for three years.
One difficulty facing NatWest is that its capital ratios - especially the
tier 1 ratio of core capital to risk-weighted - are lower than other banks.
Its tier 1 ratio at the year-end was 5.7 per cent - well above the Basle
minimum of 4 per cent but below the 6 per cent seen by analysts as a
benchmark.
Mr Richard Goeltz, NatWest's chief financial officer, has argued strongly
that there are dangers in banks holding too much capital. Yet investor
sentiment could be improved by NatWest breaking the 6 per cent barrier,
something that it seems likely to have achieved in the first half.
There are two broader challenges for NatWest. The first is to demonstrate
that the bank's directors can both run existing operations well and make
wise acquisitions. The second is to show that its mix of businesses is
well-balanced and has growth potential amid growing competition.
It has an initial advantage in having a new layer of senior managers who are
respected by analysts. But, as Lord Alexander admits, the achievement of
clearing up past mistakes in the US and Australia and bringing down bad
debts in the UK does not mean they are instinctively trusted in all
decisions.
'We have to establish credibility not just now, but at all stages in the
economic cycle,' says Lord Alexander. The bank experienced scepticism
recently when it paid Dollars 300m - or 2.4 times book value - for Central
Jersey Bancorp, to reinforce NatWest Bancorp, its US retail bank.
Some analysts question whether it would have been better to buy before the
price rose. Mr Goeltz says they are missing the point.
'Clearly, the best returns for shareholders two years ago came from clearing
up Bancorp's existing problems rather than making new acquisitions,' he
says.
Mr Wanless stresses the rigour with which NatWest's group executive reviews
such proposed acquisitions. 'We had a US bank in a poor state which we have
turned around. We know we can take 35 or 40 per cent of the costs of Central
Jersey out and double non-interest income,' he says.
Lord Alexander argues that NatWest is now being 'run like a modern business
and not - as was certainly the position - as a quasi-public institution'.
Its directors cite decisions such as pulling out of retail banking
operations in France as evidence that it is not afraid of painful decisions.
The second challenge is to build a strong mix of operations which can
withstand downturns in particular sectors, or the UK as a whole. 'UK retail
banking is clearly a market where it is not going to be easy to operate in
the short-term. There is a lot of competition here,' says Mr Wanless.
The difficulty is to show that diverse operations such as NatWest Bancorp,
Lombard, the finance house, Coutts, the private bank, and NatWest Markets,
its investment bank, can not only meet the bank's target of 17.5 per cent
post-tax return on equity, but make sense as a business together.
Mr Wanless says there are obvious ways in which they fit. Lombard can offer
leasing and discounting to small companies which are less willing to take
bank loans; and the retail bank can sell medium-sized companies products
developed by NatWest Markets such as currency and interest rate swaps.
Less obviously, he says that the UK retail bank gains from the group owning
a US retail arm which can experiment with new ideas in an innovative market.
He cites a project run by NatWest Bancorp in which it is offering financial
services through a cable television link in New Jersey.
Yet the fact remains that investors are more likely to be convinced of
NatWest's merits by a clear dividend signal this morning than by discussion
of the bank's general strengths. However, it makes NatWest's directors feel
a Martin Taylor premium in the share price may otherwise elude them.

FT  02 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Investment side helps lift Govett to
Dollars 27.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Govett &amp; Co, the fund management and insurance group, announced a sharp rise
in investment management profits in spite of weaker market conditions in the
first half of 1993.
The fund management division saw profits increase by 62 per cent, from
Dollars 8.37m to Dollars 13.6m (Pounds 8.7m), despite increased redemptions
from US retail investors and a slow down in capital inflows after the rise
in US interest rates.
Interim pre-tax profits rose by 20 per cent from Dollars 22.8m to Dollars
27.3m on the back of Dollars 2.5bn additional funds under management from
acquisitions, the launch of new funds, and some Dollars 200m of new
institutional client money.
The company launched three new mutual funds in the US in the first half of
1994, and a further two funds in the UK. At the end of June, it had Dollars
8.6bn of funds under management or administration.
Govett has decided that the key to increasing the build up of funds is to
strengthen its distribution. It has secured agreements with Charles Schwab,
Paine Webber and Smith Barney to distribute its products, and is looking for
other similar deals.
Its insurance division saw profits rise from Dollars 8.24m to Dollars 9.7m,
and the group exceeded its budget in achieving Dollars 107m of new premium
sales. However, earnings from development capital investment fell from
Dollars 3.41m to Dollars 3.27m.
The company is seeking to increase funds under management through
acquisition, and has some Dollars 60m liquid funds to spend on any
purchases.
It is also planning to upgrade its quotation from Nasdaq to the New York
Stock Exchange, and will work on the required expansion of its shareholder
base in order to achieve this.
Fully diluted earnings per share rose 20 per cent to 30.5 cents.
The company is paying an interim dividend of 11 cents, up from 10 cents.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Union Carbide and Enichemin polyethylene venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Union Carbide of the US and Enichem, the chronically lossmaking
petrochemicals arm of Italy's Eni energy and chemicals group, yesterday
announced their intention to set up a joint venture which would create
Europe's largest manufacturer of polyethylene, the most widely used plastic.
Enichem will put its entire 1.1m tonnes a year polyethylene capacity into
the 50-50 joint venture, as well as its ethylene plants at Brindisi, Italy,
and Dunkirk, France.
Union Carbide will supply its leading Unipol technology and contribute to
the cost of constructing a new 400,000 tonnes a year polyethylene plant in
Brindisi.
Mr Marcello Colitti, Enichem chairman, said the deal was 'a real turning
point for Enichem'. It will be Union Carbide's first direct foreign
investment since the 1984 Bhopal disaster in India, when more than 3,000
people died.
The companies expect the 50-50 joint venture, which has taken three years to
negotiate, to begin operation during the first quarter next year. The deal
is subject to European Commission approval.
The move will be a blow for BP Chemicals which had been negotiating a
technology licensing deal with Enichem for polyethylene.
The decision to build a polyethylene plant using Union Carbide's technology
would also be a setback for Montell, the venture between the Anglo-Dutch
company Royal Dutch/Shell and Italy's Montedison. The deal will make it more
difficult for Montell to justify building a plant with its competing
technology.
The new Brindisi plant, making mostly modern linear low-density polyethylene
(LLDPE) could allow the joint venture to close some small and unprofitable
plants manufacturing older generation low-density polyethylene. Most of such
factories are in southern Italy, but any attempt to close them is likely to
run into political opposition.
Mr Colitti has said his aim is to focus on fewer sites. Union Carbide said
the new plant would replace existing capacity of about 240,000 tonnes a
year.
Mr David Oxley, director of polymers at consultants Chem Systems, said the
European LLDPE market was suffering 20 per cent overcapacity.
Union Carbide will contribute half of the DM650m equity capital of the new
company in cash, while Enichem's share will comprise part of its
petrochemicals plant. The rest of Enichem's polyethylene capacity will be
put into the company in the form of subordinated loans.
Union Carbide and Enichem are also understood to be negotiating a venture in
ethylene glycol, a raw material for PET, a plastic used in in bottles and
polyester fibre.
Analysts expect the Brindisi plant to cost about Dollars 450m to construct.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Fickleness and frenzy in the Shanghai market: A look at the
surge in Chinese shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China's infant stock markets surged more than 30 per cent yesterday after
Beijing announced a rescue package aimed at arresting a slide in share
values. Shanghai's A-share index for local investors leapt 36 per cent to
447.68 points, reversing the sharp declines of recent months. The Shanghai
index had lost 80 per cent since highs of early 1993.
The leap followed measures announced last Friday by the China Securities
Regulatory Commission (CSRC) that it was suspending new share listings this
year.
The CSRC, which has been under pressure from disgruntled investors, also
said it would permit Sino-foreign joint venture security houses to trade in
A-shares, previously reserved for Chinese. This concession points the way to
an eventual merging of the A and B-share markets once the yuan becomes a
full convertible currency. Chinese officials are vague about the timing of
such a move, saying merely they expect it will happen 'within five years'.
China's stock markets have proved themselves among the world's most
volatile, but analysts were not prepared for yesterday's bounce.
However, they believe the rally in A-shares will be short-lived. Mr John
Crossman, of Jardine Fleming in Shanghai, said: 'I don't think it will hold
very well because the fundamentals are simply not there.'
In Beijing, China's hard-pressed stock regulators are finding it difficult
to believe that a simple package of announcements could have galvanised the
market quite so dramatically.
Mr Gao Xiqing, general counsel to the CSRC, was a 'little surprised' at the
magnitude of the surge, but he also noted that China was making progress in
its efforts to build confidence in the markets.
In contrast to the surge in the A-share market yesterday, B-shares
registered modest gains. The Shanghai index was up just 1.31 points or 1.83
per cent.
Shanghai securities analysts say that after being in the doldrums for much
of the year, B-shares had begun to attract support among 'bargain hunters'.
They saw no reason why B-shares should not continue to strengthen.
Price/earnings ratios had come down to multiples in the low teens from the
high teens early in the year. Some quality companies' price/earnings ratios
were below 10 which had rekindled investor interest.
Mr Crossman also noted that H-shares - mainland companies listed in Hong
Kong - had been strongly traded in the past few weeks. 'Local players have
been punching up H-shares. Now you're getting a wash of enthusiasm for
China-related plays.'
Mr Crossman expected B-shares, which were down this year by some 40 per cent
at their low point - the index has appreciated by about 10 per cent since
June - to continue to strengthen. 'We're looking for a good sustainable
rally from October through the early part of next year,' he said.
Among factors that are helping to feed an improvement in investor confidence
are signs that China's economic austerity measures are beginning to bear
fruit with unsustainable rates of growth coming down and inflation showing
signs of abating.
Investors may be betting on the government easing credit restrictions in the
latter part of the year and there are already indications that the central
bank is loosening the purse strings to assist faltering state enterprises.
Chinese securities regulators argue that lack of institutional investors -
most investors are individuals - is one of the main causes of market
volatility, but analysts cite other causes such as the relatively small
percentage of shares in a particular company on offer in the market.
Under the Chinese system less than a third of a company's shares are traded
and these are held mainly by individuals. Other shares are vested in the
state or are held by 'legal persons' such as institutions, corporations and
quasi-government bodies.
This structure is aimed at preserving state control, but analysts argue that
if the authorities allowed 'legal person' shares to be traded freely this
would 'make for a healthier market'.
A 36 per cent rise in one day indicates inherent instability. China's stock
markets are destined for a continuing rollercoaster ride as investors'
febrile sentiment ebbs and flows.

FT  02 AUG 94 / TV satellite operator faces revolt by users
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Societe Europeenne des Satellites, the Luxembourg company that operates the
Astra television satellite system, is facing a potential user revolt over
managerial instability at the group. At stake could be as much as Pounds 1bn
of business, as Europe's main satellite broadcasters plan to introduce
digital satellite television channels over the next few years.
Some users of Astra satellites were alarmed at what they saw as an attempted
coup against Mr Pierre Meyrat, director-general of SES. Mr Meyrat is
credited with creating one of the world's most successful satellite
television companies. An attempt was made to remove him last month by a
group of directors and shareholders including the two SES vice-chairmen, Mr
Romain Bausch, chairman of the SNCI bank of Luxembourg, and Count Roland
Kergorlay, a private investor. Mr Meyrat ultimately received widespread
support at a board meeting last week.
One Astra user said yesterday he would be wary about signing up for the vast
investment needed to introduce digital channels if the SES director-general
could be removed without warning.
A number of users wrote to SES in support of Mr Meyrat, including British
Sky Broadcasting and Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, which has a 16.6 per cent
stake in SES. Some are seeking assurances of managerial stability and are
demanding to be kept better informed about the company.
Unless assurances are received, at least one big Astra customer is prepared
to go to Astra's rival Eutelsat, which is owned by Europe's
telecommunications organisations, for its new digital business.
SES operates three 16-channel television satellites and plans to launch a
fourth in the autumn. The fifth and six satellites are scheduled to be
dedicated to digital television and should be capable of broadcasting more
than 150 channels across Europe.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Bank joins CU in pioneering insurance deal: Abbey National
announces joint venture alongside 41% rise in pre-tax profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Abbey National, the home loans and banking group, and Commercial Union, the
UK's largest insurance company, are to create a joint venture selling
general insurance to personal customers.
The venture, the first of its kind, is expected to come into operation in
the middle of next year. Both parties are committed to it for at least five
years. The announcement accompanied Abbey's interim results, which showed a
41 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 423m (Pounds 301m).
Mr Peter Birch, chief executive, said Abbey was injecting Pounds 25m initial
capital into the venture - around two-thirds of the total - and expected it
to yield more than Pounds 100m pre-tax profit in five years' time.
It replaces Abbey's existing relationships with a panel of general insurers
including CU, Royal Insurance and Legal &amp; General.
Royal has been invited to take part in reinsurance for the first three years
of the new operation, while any future arrangement with L&amp;G is still being
discussed. L&amp;G said yesterday that in 1993 Abbey accounted for less than 30
per cent of its household insurance. It emphasised that its main business
was life insurance and pensions.
The new venture will be divided into two businesses. Abbey will provide 75
per cent of the initial capital for the operations business unit which will
deal with premium collection, product design and claims, while CU will
provide the other 25 per cent. Abbey will receive the profits and give CU an
agreed rate of return on its investment.
By contrast, CU will own 85 per cent of the underwriting company with Abbey
holding the remaining 15 per cent. Mr John Carter, CU chief executive, said
the venture offered 'attractive but not excessive margins for both
companies'. It would be efficient and have the capacity to deal with an
expanding volume of business. It did not hamper CU's ability to work with
any other organisation.
The Treasury announced last month that building societies would be allowed
to wholly own a general insurance company dealing in some housing-related
lines of personal insurance.
But the spring is probably the earliest that any society will adopt this
power, and so even a society ready to launch an operation using its new
freedom would find it hard to match the planned timing of this venture.
Abbey's earnings per share rose to 20.8p, from 12.5p, and the interim
dividend goes up by 37 per cent to 5.7p (4.15p).
The shares finished the day 12p down at 385p.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Pearson pursues stake in HK TV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pearson, the media and entertainment group, is in negotiations to acquire up
to 10 per cent of Hong Kong's Television Broadcasts (TVB), Asia's premiere
television company.
The negotiations, if successful, will result in Pearson paying about Pounds
150m for a 9.9 per cent stake in TVB - a level of investment that will not
require Hong Kong government approval.
Lord Blakenham, chairman of Pearson, whose interests include the Financial
Times, was in Hong Kong and China last week discussing a deal. Pearson
declined to comment yesterday.
The UK group, which has decided to concentrate on media and information, has
become particularly interested in expanding into Asia.
TVB has in the past been courted by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and
by Time Warner, of the US. Mr Murdoch faced regulatory problems because of
his then ownership of the South China Morning Post, the Hong Kong newspaper.
He went on to buy control of Star TV, the Hong Kong-based satellite
television company, with which Pearson tried unsuccessfully to negotiate a
deal.
TVB is controlled by Sir Run Run Shaw, its founder, and Mr Robert Kuok, the
Malaysian financier who last year bought a controlling interest in the
Morning Post from Mr Murdoch. Mr Kuok, who owns about 24 per cent of the
television company, is understood to be the seller.
TVB is Hong Kong's dominant terrestrial television provider, having a 72 per
cent audience share. It is also the television of choice for viewers in
southern Guangdong in China.
The main attraction of the company is, however, its programme making and its
library of Chinese-language material. The company produces 1,000 hours of
original television a year and has a library of 25,000-35,000 hours of
resaleable stock. This is important as TVB seeks to penetrate the Chinese
mainland and Taiwanese markets.
It is also active in south-east Asia where it is developing production
facilities and has video sales and rental businesses.
TVB's profit after tax was HKDollars 520m (Pounds 44m) in 1993. Analysts
expect the company's earnings per share to grow by about 15 per cent a year.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Cattle prices hit by EU export curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cattle prices at UK livestock auctions have fallen by up to 30 per cent
following last week's introduction of European Union curbs on British beef
exports which are aimed at stopping the spread of 'mad cow' disease.
Some butchers were also reporting a fall in beef sales, the Meat and
Livestock Commission said yesterday. But it was unsure if this was a
response to the latest publicity over bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)
or the hot weather encouraging people to eat salads.
Livestock prices have fallen even though many farmers are holding their
animals back from market in the face of the new rules, which state that
carcass beef for export must come from herds free of BSE for six years,
rather than two years previously.
The price falls mainly affect beef which is processed into meat pies and
sausages and industry sources said it would be some time before there was
any impact on retail prices.
The Livestock Auctioneers' Association said yesterday it was seeking an
urgent meeting with Mr William Waldegrave, the new agriculture minister,
over the restrictions agreed by EU farm ministers two weeks ago.
Mr Jim Watson, association president, said prices of cull cows, or old dairy
cows, had fallen by 30 per cent, while those of young steers and heifers
were down by about 10 per cent. 'It's because there's too much beef on the
market,' he said. 'At a stroke, we've lost our export market overnight.'
Carcass, or bone-in, beef accounts for 84 per cent of British beef exports
to the EU. Of the 107,000 tonnes of bone-in beef exported last year, cull
cows made up 70 per cent, with young cattle accounting for the rest.
Because the cows are old, it is more difficult to trace their history and
more likely they will have spent some time on a farm with BSE. Some 52 per
cent of dairy herds have had at least one case of the disease.
Mr Watson said the agriculture ministry was creating too much paperwork for
farmers and delaying export of the minority of animals that could be given a
clean bill of health.
Mr Martin Burtt, chairman of the National Farmers' Union livestock
committee, said a two-tier market had opened up, with animals that carry
BSE-free certification commanding a 70 per cent premium in some markets.
He urged the ministry to circumvent the Data Protection Act and give farmers
names and addresses of BSE-free farms so they could trace the history of the
animals they want to sell.
He said the ministry received 7,000 inquiries from farmers last Friday. The
agriculture ministry said its computer experts were looking at ways to help
farmers trace animals' health history.

FT  02 AUG 94 / CSO in private sector link-up to market official business
data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's Central Statis-tical Office has entered into its first
private sector partnership to publish and market its business and trade
statistics.
Taylor Nelson AGB, Britain's largest market research group, has won a
three-year contract as part of the CSO's attempts to assume a greater
business focus and broaden its role away from being simply a supplier of
statistics to the government.
The deal, which will be officially announced later this week, is expected to
yield annual turnover of between Pounds 1m and Pounds 3m, with the profits
shared between the CSO and Taylor Nelson AGB.
The group plans to publish about 90 annual reports and 36 quarterly
collections of official business data on a detailed sectoral basis. These
would be targeted largely at the estimated 28,000 UK companies that
currently supply data to the CSO, according to Taylor Nelson.
The reports, which would be compatible with other European Union statistics,
would effectively replace the CSO's earlier business publications, which
were controlled by Her Majesty's Stationery Office, the government data
publishing department.
The CSO is negotiating with financial news agencies to market statistical
information to the City through computer links. Meanwhile, a contract for
the collection of the retail price index data, the first area of data
collection to be opened to private sector competition, will be announced
later this month.
The Department of Employment, which currently collects the data, is bidding
for the contract, worth about Pounds 1m. More than a dozen private sector
market research groups, understood to include Taylor Nelson AGB and the
British Market Research Bureau, are also competing.
Mori, another leading market research group, has refused to bid, claiming
that the tender is too restrictive and skewed in favour of existing
practices.
The CSO also plans to hold tenders for the collection of compulsory business
data next year if the government's deregulation bill is passed. The bill
would remove the ban that prevents private companies collecting this data.
Although the plans have been welcomed by market research groups, the
programme is controversial within the CSO, where officials point out that
allowing private contractors to collect data might create problems with
business confidentiality.

The Chinese authorities' package of measures to support the domestic stock
market succeeded in spades. The 36 per cent rise yesterday in A-shares -
which can only be bought by domestic investors - is remarkable even by the
standards of a market which has fallen 80 per cent inside 18 months. While
the ban on new listings until the year-end might have been expected to
improve sentiment, the hint that foreign investors could be granted access
generated most excitement.
Yet international institutions are unlikely to rush to buy A-shares, even if
practical difficulties such as the lack of currency convertibility can be
overcome. The market's extraordinary volatility and the relatively small
size of companies which issue A-shares are good reasons to be wary.
International investors can already buy B-shares, which are traded
domestically in US dollars, but most favour the shares of the very large
Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong - or Hong Kong companies which trade
with China.
Growth and inflation appear to be slowing from the break-neck speed of last
year, while the long-term prospects remain bright. Chinese shares listed in
Hong Kong - known confusingly as H-shares - were already rising, which would
probably have lifted the domestic market sooner or later. Even if the
investment story is attractive, though, yesterday's performance shows why
most fund managers prefer the relative tranquility of Hong Kong.

Yesterday's renewed fall of the dollar against the yen was a curious, if
predictable response to the US decision to starting the clock ticking on
Japanese trade sanctions. Since Japan's trade surplus has been one of the
main props for the yen it seems odd that attempts to hack away at this
support should lead to a relapse in the dollar. It is doubly perverse if the
US move means it has given up hope that the pressure of a strong yen would
be enough to soften Tokyo's position.
The markets are clearly unconvinced by recent US declarations of support for
the dollar. Since these represent an abrupt about-turn from the previous
policy of benign neglect, some scepticism is understandable. Yet the
dollar's Y1 fall to around Y99 was relatively modest and the rate remains
comfortably above July's low of Y96.6. Perhaps the markets saw the US move
as more a matter of momentum rather than a deliberate escalation. The dollar
bulls see the muted reaction as evidence that the tide is finally turning.
Relative inflation rates apart, the winds are starting to blow the dollar's
way. The trade deficit with Japan is already moderating, if only in yen
terms. Even without sanctions the changing pace of the two economies should
ensure the process continues. US interest rates are rising and, at the
current exchange rate, dollar assets should look cheap to Japanese
investors. But there is little sign of the capital outflows from the US
ebbing. Potential Japanese purchasers of Treasury bonds are still nervous
about the currency risk and remain to be convinced that the yen's rise has
been halted. When that point comes the dollar should spring to life.

The commission earned by banks and building societies for selling household
insurance policies has been a useful source of income through recession. But
with competition from direct insurers starting to erode such payments - from
anything up to 30 per cent of premium at the peak  - they must choose
between dwindling commission income and stepping into the ring as insurers
themselves. It would be strange if Abbey National was alone in opting for
the latter route, especially once building societies are free to spread
their wings in insurance as well.
If others get the Abbey habit and form joint ventures with established
insurance companies, there could be a swift redistribution of market share
in these lines of business. The insurers would then face their own choice:
either supplying underwriting muscle to joint ventures or losing the
business altogether. Writing policies which are branded, administered and
distributed by another company clearly carries risks. Commercial Union could
find itself squeezed out, for example, if Abbey decides to shoulder the
underwriting risk itself. Even if that happens once its initial five-year
agreement with Abbey has expired, CU's decision to participate looks like
the lesser of two evils.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After all the upset about its abortive forays into estate agency and French
commercial lending, it is about time that Abbey National finally sorted out
its strategic direction. Yesterday's joint venture announcement with
Commercial Union suggests that at last this may be happening. The deal
enhances its product range without forcing it into unacceptable underwriting
risk. It thus marks out the group more clearly as a broad provider of retail
financial services. Abbey is also now stressing the contribution which its
treasury operation, originally seen as simply as a diversification, could
make in structuring attractive retail savings products.
The snag is that this, more coherent Abbey is emerging just when the squeeze
on its business shows signs of becoming intense. Pressure on its UK retail
lending margin was expected. Abbey deserves compliments for standing back
from fixed-rate mortgage business when it became unremunerative, but the
first-half slippage to just 9.8 per cent in its share of the new mortgage
market is disconcerting when the figure includes the assets acquired from
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in February. Equally worrying is the
revelation that a Pounds 10bn jump in the assets of Abbey's treasury
operation has produced an increase in profits of only Pounds 4m.
In marking Abbey's shares down 3 per cent the market betrays pessimism about
its ability to respond. The question is one of degree. Abbey could
presumably scale back its treasury business quite quickly if the returns
failed to recover. That would be preferable to chasing higher-risk business.
Mortgage lending is recovering as customers switch to floating rate loans.
But after such a sharp fall in its market share, investors will want firm
evidence that it can now hold its own.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Gnomes with big ambitions: Swiss banks are looking
increasingly for earnings growth overseas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Switzerland's bankers were once famously described as 'the gnomes of
Zurich'. The image of them as cautious, secretive characters tucking away
cash in a small mountainous country has lasted ever since. But the big three
Swiss banks are now taking steps to shed it. 'It is not enough to be a gnome
any more. We must be international bankers,' says Mr Josef Ackermann, chief
executive of Credit Suisse.
Last week CS Holding (parent of Credit Suisse) opened a half-year results
season which will show a further shift in the balance of their businesses
towards global operations. Their determination to break out of an
over-crowded and competitive home market is leading to results that appeared
implausible even at the start of this decade. In another five years, their
nickname could be a relic of history.
The transformation carries risks, even if it succeeds. The range of
businesses on which they are building an international strategy is narrower
than in Switzerland, where they mix retail banking, lending to big companies
and securities broking. Abroad, the big three want to rival global
investment banks such as the US firm Goldman Sachs. By doing so they risk
their earnings becoming more dependent on the activity of financial markets,
and so more volatile. CS Holding's trading income fell by 35 per cent to
SFr949m (Pounds 114m) in the first six months of 1994, compared with the
same period a year before.
Furthermore, it will affect their culture. The heads of the big three
already talk of the solid, conservative Swiss approach being loosened by the
deal-making culture of their international arms. 'Our tradition is to be
long-term oriented, rather than working for bonuses. We treat the bank as if
it is our family company, and we want to keep it for the next generation,'
says Mr Ackermann.
The banks have decided to run such risks in exchange for the prize of
developing an earnings stream to supplement their Swiss profits. They face
fierce competition, not only from US securities firms which currently
dominate the securities broking and corporate finance businesses, but from
large banks in several other European countries which are also trying to
build international arms.
But the Swiss have some natural advantages. Mr John Leonard, European
banking analyst at Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank, says they gain
from their capital strength. This gives them high credit ratings - topped by
Union Bank of Switzerland's triple-A rating - which are increasingly
important in selling financial derivatives, complex instruments whose value
is based in part on that of an underlying financial market.
Furthermore, Mr Leonard argues that the Swiss banks have a history of sound
management controls. This means their shareholders are likely to support
their efforts to build international arms without fearing unexpected losses.
'All the banks strike me as having a record of strong management. They are
less likely to enter risky businesses they do not fully understand,' he
says.
The Swiss also have a pressing motive for expanding abroad. Their home has
become one of the most competitive retail banking markets in the world, and
profit margins are too low to compensate for persistent bad debt problems.
The big three's domestic return on equity fell to between 5 and 6 per cent
last year because of high bad debt, and is unlikely in the medium term to
recover to levels in other countries.
These factors led to a push abroad by the big three at the turn of the
decade. Swiss Bank Corporation and Union Bank of Switzerland had bought
London broking firms in the 1980s - with UBS making the most substantial
purchase in Phillips &amp; Drew - and Credit Suisse had merged its international
investment bank with the US firm First Boston in 1988.
But none of these efforts had worked wholly as planned. UBS had difficulty
integrating Phillips &amp; Drew with its own operations; SBC found it had not
gained true access to London markets (see below); while CS First Boston was
plagued by internal divisions throughout the 1980s and early 1990s because
it was run as a collection of regional operations rather than a single firm.
Since the turn of the decade, SBC and UBS have restructured international
operations, and tried to make them more coherent. But CS Holding has
continued with a dual strategy of expanding Credit Suisse operations, and
making CS First Boston more effective. It has linked the two with a joint
venture, Credit Suisse Financial Products, to engineer and sell derivatives.
The efforts bore fruit last year, when the Swiss banks were in a good
position to take advantage of the strength of bond and equity markets as
well as European currency turmoil. It led to UBS raising its pre-tax profits
by 69 per cent in 1993, with a third of earnings coming from abroad, while
trading income - much of it generated abroad - formed 37 per cent of CS
Holding's profits.
One of the main reasons for the Swiss banks' rapid progress in the 1990s has
been their strength in derivatives. All three were used to trading in
currency derivatives in the Swiss bond market because most multinational
companies wanted to swap out of Swiss franc issues and into currencies such
as the dollar. They have since used derivatives to push into markets where
they are weak in the underlying cash products.
Mr Robert Studer, president of the UBS executive board, says derivatives are
among the bank's most global products, and strongest growth areas. 'Being a
triple-A bank, if a company has a seven-year swap (for example, exchanging a
variable interest rate contract for a fixed rate one), they want to do it
with us,' he says. It remains 'very comfortable' with derivatives despite US
upsets such as Procter &amp; Gamble's loss on contracts sold by Bankers Trust,
the US bank specialising in derivatives.
The Swiss banks have a potential long-term advantage over US and other
investment banks in being able to back their derivatives and other
securities broking and corporate finance activities with lending. This
increases the range of services they can offer clients. Credit Suisse has
just agreed to use its balance sheet to back leveraged deals arranged in the
US by CS First Boston, while UBS has been working on integrating commercial
and investment banking abroad.
Mr Studer says that UBS at first had considerable difficulty in getting the
two disciplines to mesh with each other, but barriers are now breaking down.
'We did not believe in pushing our views down people's throats,' he says.
'Finally bankers and corporate financiers realised that, if they talked to
each other, it would make them more competitive on customer calls.'
Mr Hans de Gier, a member of the SBC executive board, says that it can
sometimes be difficult to persuade companies not to treat SBC as just a
lending bank. But the bank only wants to lend money to international
customers when it can also sell them other services. 'Some clients say they
just want a lending bank. We say goodbye, and six months later they accept
that life is a bit more complicated,' he says.
Yet despite the strong progress the Swiss banks have made abroad, two big
challenges remain. One is to compete more strongly with investment banks as
corporate finance advisers. SBC does not count its mergers and acquisitions
and advisory arm as one of its main global businesses. 'Advisory is an
important activity for us, but it does not seriously affect the bottom
line,' says Mr de Gier.
A second challenge is to establish stronger businesses in the US, a key to
forming a chain of global operations. Neither UBS nor SBC have strong
footholds in the underwriting and distribution of US equities. CS Holding
has an advantage in CS First Boston, although the investment bank has only
this year started to grasp the nettle of operating as a integrated global
business.
Mr Studer of UBS says that its hold in US corporate finance 'is not yet
where we would like it to be to support a global link'. But despite
speculation that UBS will try to acquire a US investment bank, he says that
legal barriers under the Glass-Steagall Act (which separated securities
broking and banking) are holding it back. 'As we develop, an acquisition
becomes less likely, and I think it is very unlikely today,' he says.
The Swiss banks thus still have some way to go before they achieve their
international ambitions. But they have come too far to turn back now, no
matter how the journey has changed their traditions. 'We have the more
aggressive stance of our foreign operations, and maybe the disciplined and
cautious Swiss approach,' says Mr Ackermann of Credit Suisse. 'We are
already different.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
To mention the words Swiss Bank Corporation in the City of London these days
is to provoke a sharp intake of breath, writes John Gapper. 'They did
nothing exceptional, and then I picked up the newspapers the next day and
found them claiming all the credit,' says one merchant banker who worked
with SBC on a financial deal. 'They are very clever, very sharp indeed, but
they will step over the line one day unless they are careful,' says another.
A succession of disputes with the City's venerable investment banks over
deals such as the underwriting of Eurotunnel's recent Pounds 858m rights
issue and Enterprise Oil's failed bid for Lasmo have given SBC a reputation
for aggression and opportunism. It is hardly the traditional image of a
Swiss bank, but its directors are insouciant about putting noses out of
joint.
'Sometimes we find a solution that is cost-effective for a company, and we
upset a traditional relationship. Tant pis,' says Mr Hans de Gier, the SBC
director who with fellow board member Mr Marcel Ospel has built the bank's
international business over the past four years. They have used its capital,
and expertise in trading securities and financial derivatives, to propel it
forcibly towards the first division of investment banks.
They have made the most waves in London, where SBC made a flawed attempt to
build a base in the run-up to the 1986 Big Bang deregulation of the City by
buying the broker Savory Milne. It was trying to buy a place among the
integrated firms which would mediate between large companies and
institutional investment funds. It soon found it had made a unwise choice.
'We bought it to improve our trading skills and ability to distribute
equity, but we took a good look and discovered that it was mediocre,' says
Mr de Gier, 'We had to redesign and overhaul our business completely.'
It was not just in London that SBC felt inadequate. In 1990, when the two
men devised the bank's international strategy, there were few solid building
blocks in place.
'We had a pretty clear idea of where we wanted to go, but it was not easy
for us in the early days. We faced quite a few handicaps,' says Mr Ospel.
SBC foreign operations were far smaller and less sophisticated than they
wanted them to be. They tried to show the SBC board the scale of the task by
telling directors they should consider spending between Dollars 2.5bn and
Dollars 3bn on the acquisition of a global investment bank.
In practice both men preferred a more gradual approach. 'If we had gone for
a large acquisition, we would really have been betting the farm. If it went
wrong, it could have endangered the bank,' says Mr de Gier. They persuaded
the board to expand through both organic growth and selective acquisitions.
The most important was the purchase in 1992 of O'Connor Associates, a
Chicago firm specialising in trading equity derivatives.
This gave SBC a chance to push into London in an untraditional way by
importing O'Connor's expertise. Rather than struggling to gain relationships
with companies that already had established merchant bank advisers, it built
a trading business based on derivatives, instead of the underlying bonds and
equities, and used its edge to devise innovative one-off deals both for
companies and institutional investors.
'It took us a long time as a bank to realise that we simply did not have the
sort of relationships we were aiming at. We were not going to beat Warburg
and Schroders,' says Mr de Gier. Instead, SBC decided to make its core
profits by trading, and mount ambushes on the better-established investment
banks by approaching their clients with corporate finance deals sometimes
involving derivatives.
Not unnaturally, this has hardly endeared SBC to the banks whose business it
is raiding. 'We don't seek conflict with other banks, but if that it what it
takes we are not going to slink away from it,' says Mr de Gier.
In one sense, SBC has little to lose from provoking such conflict, since it
gains from the image of being an outsider breaking into the City. Yet it is
a mark of how far SBC has travelled in four years from the conservatism of
its domestic culture. 'The bank is very comfortable with what is happening
in London,' says Mr de Gier, 'We are not just two wild guys running away
with the business.'

FT  02 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Cutting public expenditure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK Treasury has long taken a robust - even brutal - approach to the
appraisal of government departments' spending plans. A candid clash of
opinion behind the veil of official secrecy subjects such plans to rigorous
and searching scrutiny. That veil was temporarily lifted yesterday with the
leaking of a letter from the Treasury to Mr Michael Heseltine, Trade and
Industry secretary, on his department's programmes of support for industry.
The letter was written three weeks ago by Mr Michael Portillo, at the time
chief secretary, as part of the 'fundamental expenditure review' of the DTI.
These reviews were launched in February 1993 to examine departments'
long-term spending plans at a time of concern over underlying pressures for
continuing growth in public expenditure. The aim was to find areas of public
expenditure from which the state might withdraw altogether or where spending
might be better targeted.
The leaked extracts of Mr Portillo's letter appear to focus much more on the
first part of the brief than the second. Mr Heseltine is castigated for
offering no candidates up for the axe, apart from one where activity is
already suspended. He is accused of supporting the sort of interventionism
prevalent in earlier decades, which Conservative governments since 1979 have
prided themselves on abandoning. He is urged to be much more radical in
getting government 'out of businesses and individuals' hair'.
Fundamental rethinking
It is right that the Treasury should urge such fundamental rethinking on
ministers as part of the current reviews. Yet Mr Heseltine deserves credit
for having already detached his department from activities that are better
suited to the private sector. He has taken the lead in privatising his
research agencies, for example, rather than wasting time on market-testing.
He has also undertaken to privatise coal and the post office (the latter
with less than full-hearted support from some cabinet colleagues).
As for the DTI's budget, it has been shrinking over recent years, from
Pounds 2.2bn in 1988-89 to around Pounds 1.25bn this year. There is no doubt
that more could be done to focus programmes of support for industry, to
ensure that they are not displacing private sector consultancies or
duplicating research that business would happily pay for. But there is a
role for government in helping small and medium-sized businesses in getting
into export markets or in tapping into what consultancy can offer.
Selective assistance
And in a world where countries compete for inward investment, there is also
a role for regional selective assistance in bringing jobs to the UK's
assisted areas. A recent study by PA Economic Consultants found that,
between 1985 and 1988, the scheme had created or safeguarded at least 75,000
jobs at a net cost of Pounds 560 to Pounds 790 per net job year. The
benefits of persuading Nissan to come to Sunderland, or Honda to Swindon,
have reached far beyond the jobs created to bringing new work methods that
have been copied in other UK industries.
Compared with the Pounds 251bn the government will spend this year, the
DTI's budget is almost insignificant. If the Treasury is to make a
worthwhile impact on future public spending plans, it is the big spending
departments - such as social security, health, education and the Home Office
 -that will need to be tackled. Yet the early results of the reviews in
these departments have been disappointing.
In health and education, spending will rise in real terms over the next
three years. Ministers continue to duck the question of how to fund the
expansion of higher education: until they face it, spending will ratchet up.
In the Home Office, the review has spurred the greater use of private
finance in the prison service - but that will merely hold the budget
constant. It is only in social security where real progress appears to have
been made in whittling down the department's spending growth.
No department can immunise itself from the pressures on public expenditure.
And the demand to justify value for money in all government programmes
should be unremitting. But the Treasury would be well advised to concentrate
on some of the beams in Whitehall's eye before setting about removing the
motes.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Leading Article: US boxed in over Japan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At first sight, last weekend's US threat of unilateral trade sanctions
against Japan may look like an attempt to use American strength to browbeat
Tokyo into concessions. On closer inspection, however, the evidence suggests
that it is Washington which has boxed itself into a corner and urgently
needs an escape route.
The promise that he could do better than the Bush administration in opening
Japanese markets was one of the pledges on which President Bill Clinton came
to office. Yet, with the arguable exception of an agreement covering sales
of Motorola mobile telephones, his administration's 'results-oriented'
approach has been conspicuous for its failure to deliver its intended
results.
Successive Japanese governments have, rightly, resisted US demands to commit
themselves to 'measurable progress indicators' for judging the effect of
market opening. Washington's insistence that these are not numerical
targets, which the Japanese government would be expected to meet by
intervening in its domestic market, carry little conviction. The US
objective is managed trade under another name. Its determination to pursue
it has not advanced - and may have hindered - those political forces in
Japan committed to the genuine liberalisation which Washington says it is
eager to promote.
At the same time, the administration's stance has earned widespread
condemnation among its main trade partners, above all in Asia, the region
where the US insists that the economic future lies. Its fractious
relationship with Japan, combined with its equivocal attitude towards China,
raises doubts about whether Washington knows what it wants.
Political weakness
Recently, two other factors have strengthened the impression that the
administration has lost the initiative and is negotiating from political
weakness. One is the renewal of its Super-301 trade sanctions mechanism
after the collapse in February of the trade talks between President Clinton
and former Japanese prime minister Mr Morihiro Hosokawa. This appears to
have been a delaying tactic, designed to fend off political pressures in the
US while efforts continued to reach a bilateral framework trade agreement.
However, by imposing an autumn deadline for a deal, Super-301 has placed
successive Japanese governments in a position of negotiating under duress,
making it still harder for them to justify domestically concessions the US
wants.
The second factor is the administration's recent confusion about the state
of the dollar. It has forsworn a policy of encouraging further yen
appreciation - a course which in any case might have little impact on the
bilateral trade balance. Equally, concern about the dollar requires
Washington to weigh seriously the potentially negative effect which trade
sanctions against Japan could have on currency markets.
Calm response
Tokyo's relatively calm response to the weekend's developments suggests it
perceives Washington's options to be increasingly limited. It is no doubt
emboldened by the administration's past record of retreating from
confrontations - most notoriously over its threat to deny most favoured
nation treatment of Chinese exports.
However, there is still a danger that Tokyo will feel tempted to appease
Washington with a symbolic purchase of US exports. That would play into the
hands of the US managed trade lobby and discriminate against other trade
partners. Instead, Japan should encourage the US to pursue its complaints
multilaterally, preferably through the Gatt, or in the Asia-Pacific Economic
Co-operation forum.
On any rational assessment, Washington must recognise that such an outcome
is in its best interest. Its myopic obsession with Japan's trading practices
far exceeds the importance of the bilateral trade deficit to US economic
prosperity. In stubbornly making demands which Japan is unable to meet, it
has unnecessarily antagonised an important ally, incurred international
opprobrium and diverted valuable government resources from more urgent
priorities. It is time for the US to put this narrow dispute behind it and
concentrate on reasserting its traditional leadership in global trade and
economic policy.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The embarrassing debacle over who will run the Sydney Olympic Games, due to
be held in the year 2000, has finally been ended. Gary Pemberton, chairman
of Qantas, the Australian airline, and of Brambles, the sizeable transport
group, has agreed to take the job.
The decision will be a relief to the Sydney Olympic Games Organising
Committee, which has been struggling to fill this seemingly attractive
position for almost a year.
Its troubles started when Rod McGeogh, the Sydney lawyer who headed the
effort to win the games, withdrew his name as a possible manager in the face
of some extremely ungracious local politicking.
So SOGOC called in headhunters and was on the verge of making an
announcement when the person concerned suddenly got an offer he couldn't
refuse from his existing employer. Since then, the idea of asking Mr
Pemberton, who was already president of SOGOC, has been on the cards.
The Australian businessman, who has a fairly low public profile at home,
will retain his Brambles and Qantas chairmanships, but give up some of his
other jobs. However, there is a catch.
Pemberton has only promised to take the job for two and a half years. SOGOC
plainly hopes that he will enjoy it so much that, come December 1996, he
will be prepared to stay on till the year 2000.

When it comes to personal pensions there can never be too many consumer
guides through the minefield. Legal &amp; General is the latest to have a try
with The Transfer Maze, which it has published to co-incide with its return
to selling personal pensions for those transferring out of schemes run by
their past employer.
But it is not just the consumers who need help through the labyrinth. Life
insurers and their regulators have been too dilatory in agreeing
compensation arrangements for people whose pension transfer has gone awry
after bad advice. They obviously need a guide book of their own.
For example, should insurers who sell pensions through independent financial
advisers support those IFAs when the latter are unable to cough up
compensation on their own? Even more tricky, how do you get life companies
who do not write pensions business but who are reliant on a strong IFA
sector for their own survival to contribute.
Anyone who could produce such a guide would have really earned a reputation
as an industry trend setter.

Betting on celebrity deaths is a bigger sport than Observer realised. Since
yesterday's note concerning the New York commodity traders who wager on the
Great Beyond, the postbag has been brimming with regional variations. An
English version 'differing in matters of taste and concern for fair play' is
proving popular at a merchant bank in London which for some reason asks to
remain nameless.
Inclusion of the Queen Mum is off limits, of course, and it goes without
saying that no money is involved. 'One plays the game for its own sake.' But
the Death List does come in handy as a benchmark against which to measure
in-house funds' performance in emerging markets. Last year, it was at one
stage returning a healthy 12 per cent, but 1994 has been a dog. The only hit
has been Kim Il-Sung.

When the boss of a Cotswold limestone quarry received orders regarding the
construction of a pub in Napa Valley named Winston's, after Britain's
war-time prime minister, he thought it was 'a wind-up'.
An emissary of Winston's had pitched up, delighted to find the quarry had
supplied parts of Blenheim Palace, Sir Winston Churchill's birthplace. Duly
sceptical, however, Farmington Stone boss Martin Robins contacted Winston
Churchill, the grandson and MP. The latter did in fact know something of the
project, and Robins felt able to proceed.
Graham Cook, the driving force behind Winston's, is an Englishman living in
Napa who somehow seems convinced that a 1880s-style pub (when Churchill was
about 10), in the heart of wine-growing country, will be a licence to print
money. With a historical consultant and civic responsibilities director
among the shareholders, he is leaving nothing to chance. But it sounds as if
the quarry has the better deal.

FT  02 AUG 94 / 'Twere well it were done quickly: What chance have
western-backed market reforms of succeeding in Ukraine?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JILL BARSHAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With US Vice-President Al Gore arriving in Kiev today, Ukraine's
newly-elected president is spending his second week in office just as he
spent his first: talking to western leaders about launching a programme of
market reforms to rescue one of eastern Europe's most unstable economies.
Mr Leonid Kuchma's courting of the west is a remarkable reversal of his
campaign theme of integration with Russia. Instead of the widely-expected
post-victory trip to Moscow to smooth relations with Russia's President
Boris Yeltsin, Mr Kuchma last week entertained the head of the International
Monetary Fund. He agreed to draw up an economic reform programme in
conjunction with the IMF by October.
'We'll always have time for Russia,' said one senior Kuchma official as he
came out of a meeting with Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist
Mr Rudiger Dornbusch who may become an adviser to the president. 'We need to
use the opportunity we have now to meet with the west.'
Mr Kuchma's only tilt in Russia's direction since he took office has been a
vague joint statement with Mr Yeltsin on the importance of resolving soon
Ukraine's dispute with Russia over the future of the Black Sea fleet.
In appeasing Russia but making deals with the west, 'Kuchma is playing a
smart game - he's continuing the ambiguity over Ukraine's geo-political
orientation but pursuing economic reform to get western assistance,' says Mr
Ian Brzezinski of Ukraine's parliamentary advisory council, which acts as an
independent think tank. In balancing his actions, he is motivatived in part
by political pressures: 'He realises taking the Russian path creates too
much tension with Ukraine's nationalists,' says Mr Brzezinski.
But Mr Kuchma also seems to be following the footsteps of the Russian Prime
Minister Victor Chernomyrdin, the ex-Soviet industrialist who, in spite of a
reputation as a conservative, has been pragmatic in his relations with the
west. Mr Chernomyrdin eventually succeeded in carrying out a programme more
austere than that of his radical predecessor, Mr Yegor Gaidar.
To buttress the links he is making with the west, Mr Kuchma, a former
missile factory boss, has brought into his administration a younger
generation of Ukrainians eager for the country to embrace western-style
market reforms. At stake is Dollars 4bn of World Bank and IMF loans for
economic restructuring promised at the Naples summit last month of the group
of seven main industrial nations (G7).
One recruit is 34-year-old Mr Volodymyr Kuznetsov, recently named as head of
Mr Kuchma's Economic Service, which is responsible for drawing up policy
proposals. Mr Kuznetsov, was trained at Moscow State University by the
Gorbachev-era radical economist, Mr Stanislav Shatalin, author of the 1990
'500-day plan' to introduce market forces into the Soviet Union which was
watered down by the then Soviet leader.
The initial signs are that Mr Kuznetsov will have few difficulties working
with the two ministers responsible for economic policy - even though both
were appointed by Mr Kuchma's predecessor, Mr Leonid Kravchuk. Economics
minister Mr Roman Shpek is keen to see an IMF programme adopted, while
western observers saw Mr Petro Hermanchuk, the finance minister, as a
welcome replacement for his predecessor, Mr Hrihory Pyatachenko, regarded as
a typical old-school, Soviet minister.
But if Mr Kuchma is to lay the foundations of an economic programme that
would meet IMF approval he has only a short time to act. Ukraine's
communist-dominated parliament adjourned last Friday for a one-and-a-half
month summer recess. 'We're going to use this window to the maximum,' said
Mr Kuznetsov. He has on his desk draft decrees awaiting the president's
signature in the next few weeks which propose action in four main areas:
The clarification of the debt position of state enterprises and the
launching of bankruptcy proceedings against those judged to be deepest in
the red. The introduction of a single exchange rate by late autumn to
replace the current complex system of market and various official exchange
rates.
A switch to issuing government bonds to cover new debt incurred by the
government, instead of printing money.
Lowering official interest rates to spur investment.
Western economists say these measures are a good first step - in particular
because of the impact they will have on government finances. A western
backed programme, however, would almost certainly involve far more extensive
changes to the structure of Ukraine's overwhelmingly state-dominated economy
(less than 10 per cent of enterprises have been privatised).
'My sense is they're (the administration) ready to start now to see what it
means to stop the deficit,' said Mr Dornbusch. 'The wind is blowing strongly
for change. But it won't be easy.'
Mr Kuchma has yet to prove that any decrees he signs will actually be
implemented - given the cumbersome state of Ukraine's bureaucracy. But a
still bigger obstacle may be the parliament, which could overturn even the
limited steps proposed so far by Mr Kuchma. The largest parliamentary
faction - from the revived Communist Party of Ukraine - pushed through a
temporary freeze on privatisation shortly before the summer recess. The
president appears to be gambling that he can cower the parliament into
endorsing his economic plans.
This will not be easy. An apparently fickle electorate voted for a
parliament hostile to economic reform three months before it elected Mr
Kuchma president after a campaign in which he had promised just such
changes.
Adding to the task Mr Kuchma faces are Ukraine's mounting economic problems,
which threaten to make reform harder than elsewhere in the former Soviet
Union. For instance, the economy, left with the steel mills and heavy
industrial plant set up to equip the old Soviet military machine, was
developed at a time when oil was supplied virtually free from Russia.
'It's much easier to turn around a small country like Estonia. Ukraine is
one of the largest countries in Europe,' says Harvard economist Professor
Jeffrey Sachs. 'You're talking about a very large number of people. So much
industry is in the wrong place.'
Ironically, Ukraine's economic decline since independence in 1991 has, in
some respects, made reform easier. One factor is psychological: falling
living standards for the country's 52m citizens have convinced an increasing
number radical reform is needed. Steep falls in production also mean 'much
downward adjustment associated with structural reform has already taken
place', according to Prof Sachs.
But the deterioration has encouraged the black market. To some extent that
is also a good sign, suggesting a nascent market economy is emerging. But
evading the law has become so commonplace that it will be hard to encourage
people to pay taxes even if administrative regulations are relaxed to free
up trade.
That adds to the pressure on Mr Kuchma to act sooner rather than later. Just
as the parliamentary recess offers him an opportunity, it is also an opening
for the west to assist and promote a genuine stabilisation programme in an
economically backward country which could become politically unstable if its
economic decline spirals out of control. 'When you come in and say we're
ready to help from the start, there's a greater chance of things of
working,' said Prof Sachs.
For the west, a stable Ukrainian economy would put in a less threatening
light the problems of the Chernobyl nuclear power station and Ukraine's
ageing nuclear weapons. With the new administration there is a chance to put
relations on new footing. 'Kuchma's the new man. It's a chance to see if
there's a new opening to do something different,' says one western diplomat.
More basically, the prospect of western money flowing into Ukraine's
distressed economy, may help the president overcome the considerable
domestic obstacles to reform.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Major's position concentrates state
power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANTHONY BARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I listened carefully to the prime minister's speech to the European
Policy Forum on the limits of the state ('Major vows to limit role of
state', July 28). Despite your editorial's lukewarm comments ('Major's
soliloquy'), it may go down as an historic moment. For Mr Major claimed that
there should be no change to Britain's constitution: no new constitutional
settlement whether with respect to Europe, to Scotland and Wales, in making
quangos accountable or even a Bill of Rights. Across the board he opposed
positions recently reaffirmed as Labour policy by Tony Blair, in his Cardiff
speech.
It is strange that such fundamental differences are so poorly reported. If,
for example, the leading American presidential candidate were to demand
changing the US constitution with respect to the Bill of Rights and state
powers, the clash would gain more coverage in UK media than the identical,
but real, dispute does in our own country.
Mr Major described how the role of the state always grows unless checked -
and that he wished to check it. But there is a striking irony in his
approach, for he will not allow people themselves to check the power of the
state.
A Bill of Rights could give the public the possibility of redress against
the overweening authority of an increasingly arbitrary executive. Regional
autonomy could limit the powers of the executive as well as encourage
economic initiative. A third example helps make the point most clearly. Mr
Major celebrated the publication of information on different branches of
education and the health service as helping to ensure better service and
more efficiency. And I agree, the starting point for accountability must be
clear comparative information on what public services deliver.
But who decides what to publish? Surely not the state itself. We need a
Freedom of Information Act - something Mr Major's government has set its
face against. Such an act would give the public the right to try to limit
wrongful use of authority, for example by asking who is being appointed to
quangos, and why.
The prime minister presents himself as a constitutional conservative. But he
is concentrating, not limiting, the powers exercised by government. In doing
so he is undermining its legitimacy.
The next election, therefore, may well be fought between two constitutional
revolutionaries. Those who wish to draw upon and preserve traditions of
fairness and local initiative as well as good government will do best to
heed the open radicalism of the opposition parties, and should not allow
themselves to be bemused by the low-key rhetoric of Mr Major into thinking
he represents the viable status quo.

<TEXT>
Sir, Clement Crisp's otherwise excellent suggestions smack too much of
elitism ('The decline and fall of elegance', July 18). May I suggest two
simple changes to provide a little more democracy:
To balance the evening dress which would be mandatory elsewhere, all those
in the amphitheatre would be required to wear boiler suits and cloth caps.
As a concession to the elitists, tiaras could be issued to the occupants of
boxes.
To ensure absolute equity within the selected dress zones, purchasers of
tickets would be issued with standard regulated dress appropriate to their
zone on arrival at the theatre, the Crush Bar being set aside for changing
purposes.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: OFT consistently misses point on
monopolies in food retailing sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HUGH RAVEN and Professor TIM LANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You report ('Sainsbury takes on Tesco in bid for Wm Low', July 29)
that, according to Sainsbury, its acquisition of William Low would raise the
company's Scottish market share from 3 per cent to 10 per cent, and from
11.4 per cent to 12 per cent at a UK level. If these figures are true (and
calculations of market share for the big food retailers are notoriously
variable, according to their source), a reference to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission seems most unlikely.
This would also be consistent with the periodic findings of the Office of
Fair Trading that there is no conclusive case against the big UK food
retailers on the grounds of monopolistic or anti-competitive practices.
In our view, the OFT has consistently missed the point. Food retailing, by
its nature, is not comparable with steel production or motor manufacturing.
Food shopping is a local activity, since food is both perishable and
essential to every consumer. Though distances travelled to shop have gone
up, shopping trips are still overwhelmingly under five miles in length.
It is, therefore, at a local level that the impact of retail concentration
will be - and is being - felt. In parts of the UK, the big three food
retailers have almost half the sales space, and combined market share
approaching two-thirds. It is precious little solace to the consumer facing
such concentrated markets to know that, nationally, market shares are too
low to justify a reference to the MMC.
The current takeover speculation prompts us to ask over what area market
share should be calculated. At the moment it is at the UK level. As Brussels
gains competence and member-state economies are integrated, presumably this
will shift to the EU level. Ultimately, post-General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade world market share will no doubt be considered.
The march of Sainsbury and Tesco into Scotland means the question is far
from academic. Perhaps the OFT could answer it before Low is swallowed by
the jostling leviathans.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Personal View: Misleading portrait of the poor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARY CAMPBELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Income of poorest families down 17 per cent since 1979 as richest gain 62
per cent' was the shocking headline which followed the recent publication of
a UK Department of Social Security report on low-income families*. A third
of British children were declared to be living in poverty and the Child
Poverty Action Group said 'we should be deeply ashamed'.
It is true that the gap between the incomes of rich and poor has widened a
lot under the Tories. But the headline statistics are creating a false - and
in some cases dangerous - impression.
Many of those who appear to be trapped in poverty are not as badly off as
appears at first sight. On the other hand, the official statistics overlook
the particular needs of some vulnerable groups who need additional support -
notably pensioners and lone parents.
There are three main ways in which the headline figures are misleading.
First, poverty is often defined as being below half of average income. When
this definition is used, people can fall into 'poverty' even when their
income rises - if average incomes rise faster. A third of children may now
be living below the poverty line, but it is the 1991-92 poverty line and
this is much higher in real terms than that for 1979, the base year for many
comparisons.
Second, there is evidence that the very poor are richer in absolute terms
than the poor of 1979, despite their 17 per cent fall in reported income.
The same government report on low-income families showed that the average
expenditure of the poorest 10 per cent ('decile') is actually higher than
that of the next decile up. And some people in the bottom decile spend as
much as those in the top decile.
Some of these are the self-employed, who notoriously show up in statistics
as spending more than their reported incomes.
But the spending habits of the bottom decile indicate that only about a
third are actually as poor as their reported income suggests. People on low
incomes may be living off capital or borrowing; they may not report black
market income; and some people are counted as low-income because they
happened to earn little or nothing during the short data-collection period.
More than half the bottom decile have cars, and their ownership of other
consumer durables is much closer to average than in 1979. About half the
bottom decile own their homes, well up on 1979, though fewer own them
without a mortgage.
As for the 17 per cent fall in real income, that is 'after housing costs'.
Before allowing for housing costs, the reported income of the poorest decile
has not fallen below 1979 levels, even at the peak of unemployment in
1991-92.
Today's higher housing costs at least partly represent improved housing
quality. As the reports says: 'There are indications that the bottom deciles
experienced improvements in housing conditions, both absolutely and relative
to the rest of the population.'
Finally, and more controversially, the report fails to identify as poor some
of those most in need of extra help. The statistics omit all those living in
cardboard boxes or bed and breakfast accommodation, some of the poorest in
society. They also do not allow for the extra needs of the old and people
bringing up children alone, a high proportion of those on low incomes.
Groups such as these get extra means-tested social security benefits. In
practice, these help with the additional costs they face to maintain the
same standard of living as fit young adults. Pensioners, for example, need
more heat. Their failing teeth and eyes require hundreds of pounds of extra
spending each year. They must pay for help with tasks that fit young adults
can do themselves. Holidays can no longer take the form of humping rucksacks
and sleeping rough. On the income side, earning opportunities are fewer.
But the extra these groups get in social security benefits has the effect of
making them appear better off in the statistics than they are in reality. If
the social security department published an extra set of statistics which
reflected those additional needs, the composition of the poorest sections of
society would be more accurately determined. The rates used for the main
means-tested benefit, income support, provide an easy basis for compiling
such figures.
In their present form, the statistics suggest that the elderly are no longer
poor. The danger is that they could be used to argue for cuts in benefits
for pensioners. An additional set of figures would avert this danger.
Two other quick-and-easy policy changes would also help in narrowing the gap
between the richest and poorest. One would be to restrict all tax allowances
to the standard rate - including pension contributions and lump-sum
pay-outs. The other would be to increase child benefit and make it taxable
as part of the caring parent's income.
These measures would bring down the income of top-rate taxpayers without
increasing tax rates. They would help parents pay for the kind of childcare
which best suits them, including the often neglected option of daytime care
by parents themselves. And they would push families with children up the
income scale even when temporarily unemployed.
The other top priority shown up by the statistics should be to sort out the
housing subsidy system - but that is another and even more complicated
story.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Value in investigations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RONNIE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Inspections by the Department of Trade and Industry form a valuable
function ('Bin those reports', July 28). My experience is that businessmen
and institutions alike are concerned not only to comply with the law but
also to avoid criticism. The City has a long memory.
The fact that the DTI receives a thousand requests for investigations each
year suggests that investigations are widely regarded as important and
useful.
Reports are usually made public where there is a genuine public interest
involved. They are an important influence on standards of corporate
behaviour. In one case, a solicitor who accepted an appointment as a
non-executive director of a listed company was the trustee of a settlement
owning a significant proportion of the company's shares, and his firm acted
as legal advisers to the company. Criticism in a DTI report has resulted in
solicitors being far more cautious about allowing themselves to be placed in
a position where conflicts of interest create problems.
You suggest inspectors' reports are too expensive to be accessible to
students. At Pounds 35, the Atlantic report compares well with the cost of
many leading company law and accountancy textbooks; how many of those are
the results of Pounds 6.5m-worth of research?

FT  02 AUG 94 / Arts: Cheers for Peter Grimes - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This should not be remembered simply as the year of the Glyndebourne boos.
At the end of Peter Grimes a cheer went up which was as large as any heard
at Glyndebourne in recent years, even if the enthusiasm of the occupants of
the new standing places probably accounts for a few extra decibels.
It is an irony that the most challenging of the season's five operas should
be getting the most audience-friendly performance. Trevor Nunn's production,
dating from 1992, is traditional down to the last stitch of the fishing
nets. It has sets by John Gunter that are more like the Sadler's Wells'
originals from 1945 than any other Peter Grimes of the last 20 years: one
can almost smell the salt spray on its East Anglian pebble beaches.
I have little doubt
that Britten would have preferred it to the modern re-interpretations this
year in Glasgow and London (not to mention the rest of Europe, where his
operas are at last winning serious attention). But how quaint the opera
seems in these pretty village sets, inhabited by the full range of amusing
parochial stereotypes.
When the crowd sets out on its witch-hunt ('He who despises us we'll
destroy') it is hard to take them seriously, despite Nunn arming the
villagers with medieval helmets and a Ku Klux Klan burning cross. At ENO,
this scene was for real. One shuddered at the hatred being revealed on
stage.
Glyndebourne's production treats the opera more gently. In Anthony Rolfe
Johnson it has the right Peter Grimes, lyrical, sensitive, at his best
whenever Grimes is dreaming of the home life he longs to lead. In the duet
outside the church, as he and Vivian Tierney's impressionable, young Ellen
discuss their future, one senses happiness so near at hand and yet painfully
out of reach.
Neither she nor Alan
Opie's sympathetic Balstrode are the people hardened
by a cold, wind-swept, East-coast life that we usually see.
In the scenes with the 'Borough' locals Nunn permits a lot of charming,
old-fashioned staginess that has been banished by most of his
contemporaries. John Fryatt's old woman of a Rector fusses about with
flapping wrists. Yvonne Howard's Mrs Sedley is just a silly old nuisance,
not malevolence wrapped in lace, and John Graham-Hall's caricature of Bob
Boles as an elderly
nutter never becomes a serious threat. Donald Adams is a splendid Swallow
and Menai Davies a friendly Auntie
with two serviceable Nieces
in Paula O'Sullivan and Sarah Pring. Darren Wheeler acts naturally as the
Boy.
It is difficult to get David Atherton's electrifying conducting of this
opera a few months ago at ENO out of one's mind, but Franz Welser-Most
offers an acceptable alternative, allowing each act to build up from a
gentle start to some fierce (and loud]) climaxes. The London Philharmonic
played well for him.
It will be interesting to see if this Britten cycle at Glyndebourne is to
progress further.
Further performances until August 25

One American influence on Cuba that seems to have developed deep roots is
baseball. It is the national sport - and then some. A whole different ball
game (BBC 2 at 7.40), the programme that travels the world to reveal how
important sport is to some cultures, looks at the phenomenon. Castro is a
great fan; seven players have made it into politics; yet for the stars the
real money lies across the Florida Straits, a constant temptation which few
apparently dare succumb to.
Keith Floyd seems much happier eating his way through Italy than wrestling
with the mysteries of south east Asian cuisine. This week (BBC 2 at 8.30) he
has reached Umbria, and after a spot of grilled perch for breakfast he goes
mushroom hunting before settling down to the cooking - beef and mushrooms in
red wine.
Yet another programme which has successfully made the jump from radio to
television is Just a Minute (ITV at 10.40.)
Robert Jahn was Dean of Engineering at Princeton University until his
interest in ESP lost him the respect of his colleagues. He is the latest

FT  02 AUG 94 / Arts: Scenes from Constable's sketchbook - Susan Moore draws
attention to the intimate masterpieces which are so easily overlooked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Blockbuster exhibitions are not an easy place to consider drawings.
Monochrome, uniformly hung in bland museum mounts and frames, they
inevitably appear like dowdy poor relations; there are always expanses of
luscious oil paint urging us on. In the case of John Constable, there are
bravura oil sketches and watercolours vying for our attention too. Beside
his showy, revolutionary Academy six-footers like 'The Leaping Horse' and
'The Hay-Wain', his pencil drawings are all too easily overlooked.
For this reason the relatively small show at Dulwich Picture Gallery,
believed to be the first solely devoted to Constable as a draughtsman, is
especially rewarding. The bulk of the exhibition is drawn from the
collection of David Thomson, grandson of Roy Thomson, founder of the
Canadian media empire. His is the largest holding of Constable drawings
outside the V&amp;A, and it is aired in public for the first time here.
Dulwich's narrow exhibition galleries make for a sympathetic setting in
which to study these often intimately-scaled and always heart-felt landscape
studies - and they repay our scrutiny handsomely.
Constable was a slow developer. An introductory section shows him throughout
his 20s and 30s trying his hand at the various styles of some dozen
contemporary draughtsmen. In 'A Farmhouse by a River', he is emulating his
first tutor, JT 'Antiquity' Smith, borrowing the drawing master's looping
pen and ink line and his taste for coloured tints. In an expansive panorama
of a wooded landscape, the distant trees are simply outlined in pencil, a la
Joseph Farington. 'Chalk Church' sees him adopt the nervous, Canaletto-ish
line of Richard Wilson. In 'A Lane near East Bergholt', the density of
foliage of the trees is conveyed by Gainsborough's rapid diagonal lines of
shading using the softest graphite.
It is only on the pages of the pocket sketchbooks of 1813 and 1814 that
Constable comes into his own, responding to his native Suffolk landscape
with an original and distinctive voice. The tiny sheets - 3 by 4 inches,
sometimes slightly larger - of these and later sketchbooks are the gems of
the show. On these pages Constable the draughtsman achieved the
extraordinary feat of combining painterly breadth and particularity.
He formulates a shorthand that finds exact visual equivalents for the
information he is intent on recording. Topography, time of day and weather
conditions are thus precisely rendered. We can judge exactly the distance to
the knoll of trees or the incline of a bank, and comprehend the lie of the
land of the rapidly noted panorama beyond and the cursorily abbreviated
figures or cattle in the foreground.
A distant rain-squall is rendered by a faint scribble of vertical lines, a
flock of birds in flight by the merest dots of varying density. A keen eye
for the effects of light and shadow and an infinite variety of touch
enlivens the surface of each landscape or tree, note 'The Great Alder in
Leadenhall Garden'. Constable referred to these sketches as 'my memoranda'.
These vignettes have an immediacy and sense of place that bring them to
life.
Interestingly, Constable's shorthand never appears formulaic. He seems to
respond to each scene afresh. Unusually, he also chose to depict landscape
as he found it, without wanting to elevate it as high art. Most of the
drawings in the exhibition are intimate pencil studies made directly from
nature, memoranda that formed the basis of Constable's studio paintings for
the rest of his life.
There are working drawings made during the development of the composition of
major oils, 'Stratford Mill' and 'Hadleigh Castle'; a pencil portrait;
strange, dense iron-gall ink sketches for a book illustration; and a proof
mezzotint for his English Landscape of 1832, almost completely worked over
in thunderous wash and white heightening. By now, Constable had, at long
last, been elected as a full Royal Academician, his beloved wife had died
leaving seven children and there was little opportunity for sketching in the
countryside.
The show closes with a relaxed and open 'Dowles Brook', executed during a
rare expedition to Worcester taken in 1835 to deliver three lectures on the
history of landscape. In this Constable employs a whole vocabulary of pencil
marks, from flicks of the pencil point and soft hatching to using the dark,
chiselled edge of the graphite, but the intensity of his earlier vision is
dimmed.
The exhibition continues at the Dulwich Picture Gallery until October 16,
and travels to the Frick Collection in New York in November and to the Art
Gallery of Ontario in May 1995

FT  02 AUG 94 / Arts: 'The Wreckers' resuscitated - Promenade concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dame Ethel Smyth (1858-1944) was almost as old as Elgar, and outlived him by
a decade. In this retrospective Proms centennial year, it was an excellent
thing to remember this daughter of Marylebone: besides being a composer, a
suffragette and a number of other interesting things she was an occasional
Prom conductor. At Sunday's Prom, Odaline de la Martinez conducted her 1906
opera The Wreckers, by which she wanted 'to stand or fall'.
The 'wreckers' are a poor Cornish village tribe who take it as their
God-given right not only to pillage any ship wrecked on their picturesque
coast (and murder any survivors), but to increase the divine bounty by
putting out the lighthouse lamp whenever there is a promising storm. Their
headman is a fiery pastor; his young wife and her secret lover Mark are the
only moral dissidents in town. The lighthouse keeper and his daughter -
Mark's rejected sweetheart - along with the tavern landlord and his young
son (a breeches-role) are the remaining principals.
The action is expertly contrived, with extraordinarily pungent pre-echoes of
Peter Grimes. Act 1 introduces the variously troubled characters, and
climaxes with the villagers' feral excitement at the prospect of another
wreck; in Act 2 the dissidents light a warning beacon (rather than
extinguishing it, as in Tristan) and swear eternal love, thus inviting
catastrophe; in Act 3 the village condemns them to elemental death in a
cavern (as in Aida, but wet instead of dry).
When Dame Ethel wrote The Wreckers with her devoted Henry Brewster - in
French originally, because the American Brewster had been raised there - she
was already a mature, experienced composer, essentially German-trained. She
could boast the friendship and approval of Clara Schumann, Brahms, Nikisch,
Grieg, Tchaikovsky; the excellent programme-note by Ronald Crichton, who
edited her Memoirs recently, ascribed The Wreckers' lively, colourful
orchestration (hardly German at all) to Tchaikovsky's guidance. For her
time, she was a determined progressive who knew - up to a point - what was
going on.
Sunday's performance revealed a well-made, well varied opera, original in
much of its detail, eminently worth putting on. Pretty good, in short; but
'pretty good' is what many other forgotten operas are too: operas which have
not entered the repertoire because they are neither quite first-class music,
nor exhibits whose strongest moments outweigh the dross around them.
In the music and the dramatic action alike, Dame Ethel was too sensitive to
what had already been done. She understood the point of other composers'
best strokes, and emulated them - very professionally, not copying - where
possible. But the result lacks integral conviction: we get a first act in
which some of the characters establish themselves in uncomplicated ballads,
in old number-opera style (once with a sudden flash of Carmen), and a second
in which the fated lovers go into Tristan mode.
There I disagree with Crichton, who hears Wagner in The Wreckers only in the
overture (Flying Dutchman) and in a few Ring-ish bits later. But if the long
duet is not a steal from Wagner, it is clearly the work of someone who has
listened hard and thoughtfully to the Tristan duet and produced her own
variant of it. That sits awkwardly: it is like introducing a character as
Little Bobby Shaftoe and later turning him into Tristan. In another place
again, where the sea suddenly gurgles in woodwinds, Dame Ethel was surely
cultivating recent memories of Pelleas.
And yet it all flows creditably, and carries some passion. The flow was
sometimes sluggish under Martinez's direction, but in fixed tempi the
orchestral sound was balanced and bright. The anguished pastor was Peter
Sidhom, the lighthouse keeper and his daughter David Wilson-Johnson and
Judith Howarth, the taverner and his son Anthony Roden and Annemarie Sand:
all excellent, and in a smaller role Brian Bannatyne-Scott displayed a
superlative bass.
The leads were more problematic. Though Anne-Marie Owens sang beautifully as
the pastor's wife, her gift for invincible dignity and sobriety is not quite
what that unhappy creature - intense, prickly, finally exultant - requires.
As her lover, Justin Lavender needed to be a full-blooded junior Tristan;
but that was not what he was built for, with his lightly elegant, objective
style. It is just possible that better-cast lovers and a more fluent
conductor might persuade us that The Wreckers is a Class B opera, not Class
C. I doubt it, though.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Boosey &amp; Hawkes, the musical instrument maker and music publisher, is
looking for a new finance director to replace Paul Hazel, 42, who has
resigned after five years in the job.
The company, which is majority owned by Carl Fischer, a private US music
publisher, gave no explanation for Hazel's departure. Hazel joined the
company in June 1989 from Brent Chemicals International, filling a vacancy
caused by Richard Holland's promotion to chief executive.
Boosey &amp; Hawkes's fortunes have recovered strongly since 1986, when it was
the subject of an unwelcome Pounds 9.8m takeover bid.
It has returned to profit and its market capitalisation has grown more than
six fold to Pounds 66m. It reports its interim results in October.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Business and the Law: Enforcement of EC directives clarified
 -European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court has clarified the rights enjoyed by individuals when a
member country fails to implement a directive within the prescribed time
limit. Where the provision in the directive is sufficiently precise and
unconditional, it may be enforced in two ways by a national court. An
individual may enforce directly such provisions only against the state or
emanations of the state. Individuals may not rely directly on provisions of
a non-implemented directive against other private parties. But, in the
latter instance, national courts must interpret national laws as far as
possible to achieve the result envisaged by a directive in its wording and
objective.
The ruling was given in the context of proceedings in Florence brought by
Miss Paola Faccini Dori to set aside a court order requiring her to pay for
an English language course she had been sold on Milan central station on 19
January 1989. As a consumer who had bought the language course away from the
seller's premises she had renounced the contract after a few days relying on
the 1985 directive on contracts made away from business premises. The
directive provided that such contracts must be subject to a cooling-off
period of at least seven days. The directive, which should have been
implemented by December 23 1987, had not yet been transposed into Italian
law.
The Italian courts asked the ECJ whether the relevant provisions of the
directive could be relied upon by one private party against another provided
they were sufficiently precise and unconditional to be enforceable by an
individual against the state.
The Court first held the directive's provisions were unconditional and
sufficiently precise to be enforced directly in a national court by an
individual against the state. The ECJ then held that the reasons for
allowing an individual to enforce rights conferred by a directive against
the state or public authority could not be extended to permit enforcement
against another private party. The reasons were member countries must not be
allowed to take advantage of their own infringement of Community law to the
detriment of private citizens.
The Court refused to extend this case law to situations involving two
private parties since it would mean the Community had been empowered to
create immediate obligations for private parties by means of a directive.
The Court held such a power can be exercised only where the Community is
competent under the Rome treaty to issue a regulation (which has general and
directly binding application). Under the treaty, directives were only
binding on the objective to be achieved but left the member countries a
discretion as to how that was done.
But the Court emphasised national courts must interpret any applicable
national law so as to achieve the purpose of a directive to the fullest
extent possible, even when national law predates the directive. The ECJ also
confirmed the principles established in its leading decisions on national
courts' enforcement of Community law. (Von Colson, Marleasing and Miret). It
explained that where the result intended by a directive may not be achieved
through interpretation of national law, member countries are obliged to
compensate individuals for any damage they have caused through a failure to
implement a directive (Francovich). Three conditions must be satisfied: the
directive must envisage that rights be conferred on individuals; the
contents of the rights must be identifiable from the wording of the
directive; and there must be a causal link between breach of the obligation
and the damage suffered.
In the case in question, the ECJ said there was no doubt the directive on
contracts negotiated away from business premises conferred rights on
individuals; the minimum extent of those rights could be identified from the
directive's wording. The Court indicated, in the event of damage to a
consumer which could be shown to have been caused by the member country's
breach of its obligations to implement the directive, the national court
must guarantee the right of consumers so damaged to obtain compensation
according to national law on liability.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Business and the Law: Risky act without a safety net - US
firms could lose out in Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL PAGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At first glance, British lawyers in Hong Kong do not appear to be having it
all their own way. In spite of the fact that UK and local lawyers still have
a monopoly over advising on local law, the American investment banks have so
far been most successful in securing mandates for the Chinese
privatisations. This has translated into ready-made opportunities for those
US law firms that have strong client relationships with US banks.
The latest tranche of 22 privatisation mandates, recently announced, was
dominated by the American houses. Partly in anticipation of this, US law
firms have been pouring into Hong Kong over the last six to eight months -
many at the request of key bank clients. Even Cravath Swaine &amp; Moore, which
has until now been less willing to move overseas than its rivals, has been
lured to Hong Kong this year. Shearman &amp; Sterling and Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell
have also opened for business there.
However, appearances may be deceptive. It is questionable whether it makes
strategic sense for US law firms to depend too heavily on their investment
bank providers. There are already suggestions that the China bonanza for
investment banks may have been overestimated, and that the large investments
being made by some US banks in Hong Kong are rash, considering how
competitive the marketplace has become.
If any of the investment banks find themselves overstretched, this would be
keenly felt by some of the recent Wall Street law firm arrivals. Unlike
their UK counterparts, Americans tend to staff offices leanly and fly teams
around the region as required. Few have built substantial Asian networks,
although most claim to be running an Asian practice from Hong Kong. Those
firms without a diversified regional practice are likely to find themselves
painfully exposed. This is the heart of the problem - a credible Asian
practice cannot be built overnight, it demands long-term commitment and a
willingness to invest in offices across the region.
Another headache affects both US and UK law firms: China's relative
commercial immaturity. Structured legislation is still in its infancy and
consequently many deals are stuck at the documentation stage.
To this should be added the fact that participation in last year's nine and
this year's 22 privatisations was effectively a loss-leader for many of the
law firms concerned. The competition was so intense that some put in
unrealistically low tenders.
This has not stopped hundreds of firms from applying for licences to
practise in China - 44 licences have already been awarded and 100 more are
anticipated this year.
There are no signs, however, that the Chinese authorities will allocate more
than one office in China to each firm. This is potentially bad news for
those that were first in: ministry contacts made Beijing the obvious choice
and, consequently, most foreign firms are there. Now, however, Shanghai's
rapid emergence as the dominant financial centre makes it an increasingly
attractive option. If a law firm is denied offices in more than one city,
there are several ploys it can use to ensure that clients can be serviced
from elsewhere in China. But how the Chinese authorities will react to the
fact that many firms are circumventing the regulations remains unclear.
These uncertainties, coupled with the near prohibitive cost of commercial
property in Hong Kong, make maintaining a healthy Asian practice an urgent
priority. As Jeremy Palmer, head of equity capital markets with Baring
Brothers Hong Kong, comments: 'Anyone, banker or lawyer, moving to Hong Kong
and concentrating solely on China business is pursuing a very risky
strategy.'
This puts the top UK firms in Hong Kong on safe ground - all have built up
substantial Asian practices, usually around offices in Hong Kong, Singapore
and Tokyo. They field large teams and have spent years establishing close
regional ties. If China fails to deliver its promised rewards in the medium
term, the expense can be offset. Many of the new US arrivals lack that
cushion.
Against this backdrop, it is small surprise that the local Hong Kong legal
market has become increasingly aggressive. Late last year, Freshfields, the
City of London law firm, acquired a team of China specialists from Coudert
Brothers, a US firm boasting a long Asian pedigree. Not only did this
furnish the firm with instant expertise in a market where Mandarin-speaking
capital markets lawyers are at a premium, it also helped to boost its
ability to advise on US law.
For British firms, the ability to advise on US law (on top of local law)
will become ever more important - enabling them to advise on both the New
York and Hong Kong listings of the Chinese privatisations. Ever more deals
carry 144A offerings (private placements in the US exempt from Securities
and Exchange Commission registration). This makes drafting the crucial
accompanying 10b5 opinions - the anti-fraud opinions required by US law - a
vital goal.
Until now, few banks would have been comfortable appointing a British firm
to render such opinions, and Wall Street felt secure in this knowledge. But
the picture is slowly changing. Carrying a heavyweight New York law
capability should help to make UK firms more attractive in this respect. A
recent appointment for Clifford Chance, the City law firm, in Hong Kong
advising the Manhattan Card Co, a subsidiary of the Chase Manhattan bank, on
a securitisation deal - where the bulk of the investors are in New York -
underlines the value of fielding US and British lawyers.
Although few of the leading Wall Street firms in Hong Kong will admit it,
the forthcoming amendment allowing them to practise local law could help
them to limit the threat posed by Freshfields, Clifford Chance and others.
Most listings will carry a Hong Kong or Euro-tranche, and this should give
them the chance to hang on to the work. They may say that they are more than
happy to work alongside their British peers, but if the market begins to
bite back in China and Hong Kong, they will be grateful for all the work
they can get.
For the future, despite the US investment banks' supremacy in China and
across Asia, British law firms look better placed to reap long-term rewards.
Immediate gains from Chinese listings in the New York markets cannot be
expected to cover the cost of running an Asian practice. If the new US
arrivals are to become permanent fixtures, they will have to invest more
heavily across the whole region. The question remains whether they are
prepared to commit resources to such an expensive strategy.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Keith Bowden and Richard Fletcher have been appointed to the new posts of
non-executive chairman and managing director respectively at the
Simon-Carves group of companies within Simon Engineering, with effect from
yesterday.
The external appointments are a further move by Simon's chief executive
Maurice Dixson to strengthen management in the company's three core
divisions, of which Simon-Carves, a process engineering contractor, is one.
Bowden, 58, was formerly director and general manager of George Wimpey
International, with many years experience in the management of international
construction projects.
Fletcher, 48, has had wide experience of international capital projects with
companies such as Constructors John Brown, British Aerospace and more
recently Nuclear Electric.
Michael Gray and Lionel Hanney will be continuing as respective managing
directors of the two principal companies in Simon-Carves - Simon-Carves UK
and Simon-Carves Australia.
Losses at Simon-Carves rose from Pounds 1m in 1992 to Pounds 3m last year,
on turnover down from Pounds 89.2m to Pounds 51.3m.

FT  02 AUG 94 / People: ICI boosts its Asia strategy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Imperial Chemical Industries' Asian expansion strategy received another
boost yesterday when it announced the appointment of Peter Shaw as senior
vice president, mergers and alliances, in Asia-Pacific.
Shaw, aged 50, below, will co-ordinate and assist the group's international
businesses with their merger and alliance activities in the region.
Presently based in the London acquisition department, he has previously
worked for 10 years in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly Hong Kong.
Although the company announced last week it would construct a Dollars 100m
plant for PET, a raw material for plastic bottles, in the US, the
Asia-Pacific region is ICI's top priority, according to Alan Spall, finance
director.
Excluding Australasia, the region accounts for about 8 per cent of group
turnover. But last year, for the first time, the company invested more in
the region than in the UK.
The company already has a paints joint-venture in Guangdong province, China,
in conjunction with Swire Pacific and Guangzhou Industrial Development
Corporation. Most recently, ICI opened its CFC replacement factory in Japan,
the result of a joint-venture with Teijin, the Japanese group.
ICI's largest investments in the region have been in north-west Taiwan, a
350,000 tonne a year pure terephthalic acid plant making raw material for
polyester.

FT  02 AUG 94 / People: Year 2000 gets its chief
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nicholas Hinton, 52, director-general of the charity Save The Children since
1985, has been appointed chief executive of The Millennium Commission, a
commission created by parliament to help fund capital projects across the UK
to celebrate the year 2000.
The commission will be financed by 20 per cent of the net proceeds of the
national lottery, which could amount to more than Pounds 100m annually.
The headhunters who sought out Hinton declared interested candidates should
possess 'presence, authority and ingenuity' and have 'experience of public
affairs', along with 'energy and drive'. Hinton clearly fits the bill on
several fronts.
He has long experience in working for a variety of charities, including the
National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders and
membership of the council of VSO.
Hinton has also, in his time, spoken out against what he has perceived to be
the bureaucratic handicaps of organisations like the United Nations. More
recently he described as 'authoritarian' a government report on the role of
charities in Britain. He dismissed the report's proposal for changes as
'privatisation by another name'.
Hinton once harboured political ambitions, having stood for the Social
Democratic-Liberal Alliance, contesting a parliamentary seat in Somerset in
1983.
Another of Hinton's loves is music. He was a music scholar at Selwyn
College, Cambridge.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Business and the Law: Lords diminish suspected fraudsters'
rights - Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The rights of suspected fraudsters under UK law have been further diminished
after a House of Lords decision which, it admits, erodes their protection
from self-incrimination.
The Lords had been asked to rule in the case of Mr Muhammed Naviede, former
chairman of the Arrows trading company, charged by the UK's Serious Fraud
Office with obtaining money by deception. His trial is pending. Mr Naviede
was compelled to give evidence to the Arrows liquidators under section 236
of the Insolvency Act 1986. A dispute then arose over whether transcripts of
his interviews with liquidators could by passed to the SFO and used in
evidence at his criminal trial.
A Companies Court judge ruled the transcripts could be passed to the SFO,
but the prosecuting agency had to undertake not to use them in evidence.
This parallels the SFO's own powers to suspend the right to silence to
obtain information under compulsion - material which then cannot be used as
evidence in court.
The Court of Appeal reversed this decision, ruling a civil judge could not
apply such a condition on criminal proceedings. Five law lords last week
upheld the Court of Appeal's decision. They ruled that issues surrounding
the admissibility in criminal trials of transcripts from section 236
interviews - whether or not this would prevent a fair trial - should be
decided by the trial judge, not by a Companies Court judge.

FT  02 AUG 94 / People: Cornford hopes insight pays off
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mike Cornford, recently departed head of global foreign exchange at Natwest
Markets, is now running a currency management group called Currency Insight.
The new business, which is in the process of being set up, will focus on
short-term trading strategies, offering investors a low risk, moderate style
of return, rather than the high risk strategies often pursued by hedge
funds.
Currency Insight is backed by Dawnay Day, a small merchant bank. It will
also be working in conjunction with Chilton Capital, a forex consultancy
group, which will assist in raising funds.
Cornford said he would primarily be trying to attract funds from an
institutional base. His marketing pitch is to offer investment managers
access to 25 years' experience as an interbank trader in the foreign
exchange market - the perspective, as he calls it, of a 'fly on the wall of
a dealing room. . . I strongly believe there is a real demand for somebody
who is closedly identified with the day-to-day comments in the marketplace.'
He said the timing of his venture was opportune becausethe volatility of
financial markets this year, often at odds with perceived economic
fundamentals, had forced fund managers to be less dogmatic about their
investment strategies.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Technology: Robots get the dirty work - Japan is developing
intelligent systems to help an ageing population
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A nifty little robot darts down a street, picks up the rubbish and puts it
into a truck. Inside a power station, another robot carries out vital
maintenance work. A hard-pressed nurse uses robotic help to move beds and
patients.
Hard to imagine though it may be, Japanese research experts are working on
such applications - and on robots for the home - although it will probably
not be until well into the next century that they can be put into practice.
Labour will be in short supply in coming years. The 125m population is
ageing and will slowly decline as the birth rate falls.
'Such systems are necessary for coming generations in Japan,' says Kazuo
Asakawa, head of the intelligent systems laboratory at Fujitsu, the Japanese
computer group. 'We have to develop intelligent systems to replace young
people.'
Most people do not want to do the so-called '3K' jobs - denoting the
Japanese words for 'dirty, difficult and dangerous' - such as working in
hospitals, collecting rubbish, maintaining power stations and cleaning.
Asakawa foresees robots also being used in the office, for handling mail and
other straightforward tasks and eventually in the home.
The key to such developments will be neural networks - complex computer
systems that can learn to recognise patterns and react accordingly. The
robots will be equipped with an array of sensors that will enable them to
adapt to their surroundings. 'In 10 years, we hope to develop autonomous
systems using neural networks,' says Asakawa.
In the view of Hiroyuki Yoshikawa, president of the University of Tokyo,
robots could be the answer to many of Japan's economic and social problems.
'It is necessary to use Japan's highly educated labour force to invent these
kinds of things.' He believes that Japanese industry must look ahead to new
products such as these to prepare for a future in which over-production and
over-capacity will inhibit industrial growth.
Japan's car industry is already plagued by over-capacity, as well as high
costs; the surge in the yen is eating further into export profits. In common
with other academics and industrialists, Yoshikawa warns of the danger of
'hollowing-out' as lower-cost countries in Asia and elsewhere take up
production of goods which have become too expensive to make in Japan. The
electronics companies are already big producers in south-east Asia and car
makers have been expanding their overseas operations.
'We must change the direction of endeavour,' adds Yoshikawa, a specialist in
engineering design theory. He thinks industry should lean
towards more automation of services such as healthcare and cleaning. He
talks of the need for greater 'amplification of services', with intelligent,
computer-controlled machines doing much of the awkward and dirty work now
done by humans.
In other countries, where unemployment is high, this is less of an issue.
But Japan's unemployment rate is less than 3 per cent, kept low by the
tradition of lifetime employment and the high level of consensus and
discipline in Japanese society. This is despite the recession after the
bursting of the 'bubble' economy of the late 1980s.
Japanese companies already use robots far more widely than the rest of the
world. In 1992, there were 350,000 robots in Japan, of which more than
280,000 were advanced (operating in different axes, or with sensors or
learning controls), according to latest statistics from the United Nations
and the International Federation of Robotics. This compared with 47,000
(42,000 advanced) in the US and 39,000 (35,500) in Germany.
The electronics industry is the biggest user of robots in Japan, followed by
cars. But the advanced applications envisaged by Asakawa, Yoshikawa and
others are still at the pilot stage. The Ministry of International Trade and
Industry supports some of them. Work is progessing on robots to take the
backache out of nurses' lifting work and on micromachines to help doctors
operate and even to carry tiny doses of medicine to certain parts of the
body.
The rubbish-collecting robots described by Yoshikawa - he calls them 'social
robots' - are still at the basic research stage. 'I can't say when they will
be ready. The direction of research is to invent new robotics for use on the
roads and streets of a city. I hope this will be completed in five to 10
years.'
A programme to develop robots to enter the containment vessels of nuclear
power plants and carry out maintenance work began in 1978, he says. The
first prototype was too heavy at 400kg. Toshiba then made a more
sophisticated one, which was suitable for the work. But power companies are
reluctant to rely on robots rather than humans for work in which safety and
reliability is essential.
'My idea is first maintenance, then social and then home robots,' says
Yoshikawa. All these areas, he feels, are ripe for 'amplification' through
intelligent automation. Ultimately, the home could be the biggest market for
robots. But to do household cleaning and other work, they must be made of
softer materials than metal and have more flexible gear systems to fit in
with the random pattern of life in the home.
Yoshikawa says there are no prototypes of the home robot yet. But he adds
that robot manufacturers such as Fuji Machine and Matsushita have shown
considerable interest. Asakawa says Fujitsu is also working on computer
programs for domestic use.
Thus, sometime around 2010, robots could be scurrying around Japanese
streets, homes, offices and hospitals doing routine jobs and taking some of
the strain out of daily life.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Technology: A quick lesson in Japanese
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Kyoto-based group of scientific researchers has come up with a machine
than can translate a 15-word Japanese sentence into English in one-tenth of
a second.
Its so-called 'massively parallel' series of artificial intelligence
computers translates at speeds 300 to 500 times faster than ordinary
artificial systems, according to the team's leader, Hitoshi Iida.
The group, from Advanced Research Institute International, a private
research unit, unveiled its system at the 12th conference of the American
Association for Artificial Intelligence which started last week.
Iida's system differs from conventional artificial intelligence in that its
software is built to give a close, rather than precise, translation of
colloquial - and hence grammatically irregular - Japanese. Conventional
systems match words and phrases only in accordance with precise
pre-programmed grammatical rules.
The Kyoto language computer has, by contrast, been fed with 100,000
combinations of certain words that are often used, but not in accordance
with strict syntax. Within these 100,000 combinations, 6,000 individual
words are classed in line with general concepts, such as food or action,
says Iida. Words included in those concepts are further divided into three
index groups of increasing levels or precision.
So the machine starts with a concept and works through the index to build an
English sentence most like the Japanese original. The machine chooses an
expression approximate to the Japanese sentence from 100,000 combinations,
by using words in the index as clues.
Other artificial intelligence machines, in attempting to make a precise
match between colloquial Japanese and English, either slow down or stop,
says Iida. Frustrated language students may be forgiven for sympathising
with the conventional artificial intelligence computers' plight.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Technology: Overtaking in the motor industry - Steel makers
are fighting off a threat from aluminium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Steel is under threat in one of its biggest markets but the world's
producers are starting to fight back. The battleground is the motor
industry; the challenge comes from aluminium, a much lighter material which
the Volkswagen group of Germany has already made clear it intends to use
extensively in future cars.
In their counter-move, British Steel and more than 20 steel producers from
Europe, Asia, Australia and North America are banding together to design the
lightest possible steel structure for car bodies. They want to help car
makers achieve cost-effective weight reductions. But the undeclared aim is
to protect the steel industry from the growing threat to steel's dominance
in car body structures.
Launching the joint programme last month, the steel makers claimed that a 20
per cent reduction in body weight can be achieved by optimising current
design and material availability, with a 35 per cent saving possible using
advanced design and production methods.
British Steel has invested heavily in developing new products -
high-strength and coated steels for the motor industry, now regarded as
possibly its most important area of business. But the UK steel maker and
producers worldwide have been jolted by the enthusiasm that Volkswagen,
Europe's biggest car maker, has displayed for aluminium and the interest
being taken in the material by other vehicle makers.
Historically, only expensive cars produced in very low volumes - such as
Rolls-Royces - have their bodies made of aluminium, which is several times
more expensive than steel. However, car makers and the big aluminium
companies such as Alcoa of the US have recently adopted a 'whole-life' and
'total energy' approach to the material. They claim that good recyclability
can be combined with simplified volume car assembly processes to make it a
cost-competitive rival to steel, while also delivering lighter, more
fuel-efficient vehicles.
Audi, VW's executive car division, has just launched an aluminium-bodied
executive car, the A8, with envisaged production of up to 30,000 units a
year. More worryingly for the steel industry, VW executives say there is no
reason why even volume cars such as the Golf should not eventually be made
cost-effectively with aluminium 'space frame' bodies - skeleton-like
structures clad with outer panels.
However, the steel companies insist that not only can steel virtually match
this level of weight-saving, it also has advantages over aluminium. It is
more easily repaired and has an already-established repair infrastructure in
place.
The steel makers also maintain that painting steel is less costly and
environmentally damaging than painting other materials; that the aluminium
recycling process is more complex and costly than the aluminium industry
acknowledges; that making steel requires only one-fifth the energy of
aluminium and that in terms of total energy usage, the lower fuel economy of
lightweight aluminium cars would only partly compensate for energy consumed
during the aluminium production process.
The steel industry's design programme is to be directed by Porsche
Engineering Services, the US affiliate of the German luxury sports car
maker. It will build on research work by Porsche Engineering for Ford and
the American Iron and Steel Institute. This has provided pointers as to how
the body weight of a four-door, medium-sized saloon could be cut by 20 per
cent.
VW is collaborating with BMW, Mercedes-Benz and German and French steel
producers on parallel projects to develop ways of designing and producing
lighter, stronger body components and sub-assemblies out of high-strength
steels. Whichever way weight savings are achieved, the potential for
reducing vehicle fuel consumption is considerable. Ludwig Hamm, Porsche's
head of body engineering, says even a 20 per cent reduction in average body
weights would save 800m litres of fuel a year in the US and Europe.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Slow start, but ready to
roll - A lack of enthusiasm has greeted the UK's Enterprise Investment
Scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's Enterprise Investment Scheme, which replaces the Business
Expansion Scheme, has got off to a decidedly slow start. Launched to attract
equity investment into private trading companies, barely a handful of
companies have tried to raise capital since the scheme began in January.
Of the few issues that have seen the light of day, one - a scheme to finance
the purchase of second-hand bulk cargo ships - was left substantially with
underwriters after the public almost totally ignored the offer.
A second scheme for The Unchained Growth Pub Companies, which was launched
last week, seems a far cry from what the government intended when it offered
investors tax breaks to back trading companies constrained by lack of
equity. The scheme involves three EIS companies buying pubs in the London
area which will be managed by Regent Inns, a publicly quoted company.
One reason for this shaky start was a desire by most EIS scheme sponsors to
see the detail of the finance bill. Now that the bill is published, the
Department of Trade and Industry has produced a comprehensive 20-page guide*
that should remove much uncertainty.
But many sponsors will remain unexcited by the new scheme. The EIS rules
have reduced the maximum a company can raise to Pounds 1m (Pounds 5m for
shipping companies). At this lower limit, the cost of sponsoring a public
issue could be as much as 10 per cent of the amount raised. Given that
up-front tax on an EIS investment is only 20 per cent, instead of a top rate
of 40 per cent under the BES scheme, investors would not receive much of a
break after deducting the costs of sponsorship.
Robert Lowe, director at Johnson Fry, one of the largest BES sponsors,
believes entrepreneurs should nevertheless have plenty of scope to raise
capital through private EIS schemes. While resigned to the fact that there
is little scope for Johnson Fry to act as sponsors on Pounds 1m EIS schemes,
he says private deals should be possible through local networks of investors
with local accountants acting as clearing houses.
Ross Macdonald, chief executive of Neill Clerk Capital which sponsored the
Unchained Growth Pub Companies scheme and issued the shipping company
prospectus, agrees there will be fewer sponsored EIS schemes. But groups
like Neill Clerk will help businesses with their documentation when trying
to raise capital through private schemes.
Macdonald says his company expects to be doing about a tenth of last year's
number of sponsored deals. Instead he will be focusing on private deals such
as one he is appraising now for a business that is trying to raise Pounds
500,000 for equipment to make a product it currently imports.
The most significant variation on the BES scheme that will attract investors
and help entrepreneurs is the tax break now available on any EIS losses,
according to Chilton Taylor of accountants Baker Tilly, which helped write
the DTI brochure.
These losses can now be offset against income or capital gains tax. An
investor with a top tax rate of 40 per cent who backs a scheme that goes
bust can only lose 48 per cent of his initial investment after taking into
account the 20 per cent up-front relief he will already have received.
In spite of this break, the reduced front-end tax relief means fewer
investors will be attracted to EIS schemes purely for tax reasons. Because
there are, so far, fewer loopholes to be exploited by sponsors pushing
tax-driven schemes, quality proposals should have a better chance of raising
finance.
At the very least, genuine trading companies are less likely to see their
proposals swept aside by artificial financial products such as the assured
property schemes that so discredited BES.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Small fry audit to go
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The rules exempting small companies from audits will come into effect on
August 11 now that regulations have been laid before Parliament.
Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, described the move as a 'major
step in the government's drive to free business from unnecessary burdens'.
The new rules abolish the need for an audit for all companies with annual
sales below Pounds 90,000. Companies with sales between this figure and
Pounds 350,000 will be able to file a simpler so-called 'compilation
report'.
Qualifying companies whose directors have yet to approve accounts on that
date will be able to take advantage of the new rules.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Management (The Growing Business): A new name for BS 5750
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BS 5750, the quality management standard that is as much reviled by some
smaller companies as it is revered by others, is changing its name.
With immediate effect, BS 5750, which is equivalent to the international
standard ISO 9000 and the European standard ES 29000, is to be called BS EN
ISO 9000.
The British Standards Institution says it is making the change to avoid
confusion about the different numbering and that BS EN ISO 9000 has few
additional requirements. But there are some.
The changes, the BSI assures us, mainly clarify the clauses of the standard
and facilitate its use in all organisations, regardless of size, industry or
activity.
BSI says all companies registered under BS 5750 should revise their quality
management systems to comply with the new standard. Copies of a guide are
being sent to all BSI-registered members and are available to others from
BSI Customer Services for Pounds 25 (Pounds 12.50 for subscribing members).

Steve Curtis started a business, built it organically, merged it with
another and sold out for Pounds 4.7m during four heady years in the late
1980s.
Yet in spite of the success of Brunton Curtis Outdoor Advertising, Curtis
received no calls after the sale from venture capital companies curious
about what he planned to do next.
'In the US, venture capitalists are looking at second- and third-time
entrepreneurs,' says Curtis. 'In Britain they have a reactive approach. They
do not seem to monitor trade sales in specific sectors.'
Curtis and his partner began to build a new outdoor advertising company in
1990 and sales grew to Pounds 700,000. 'But for three years we did not hear
a dicky bird,' Curtis says.
Curtis then raised venture backing when he had the opportunity to buy back
part of his business from Mills &amp; Allen, but even then some venture
capitalists showed great reluctance to back him.
Curtis's experience is not uncommon. According to Ken Robbie, research
director of the Centre for Management Buy-Out Research (CMBOR) at Nottingham
University, second-time entrepreneurs in the UK are under-utilised by
venture capitalists.
The lack of interest in a battle-toughened army of footloose entrepreneurs
is surprising as they have probably survived the mistakes that would trip up
many first-time entrepreneurs.
By backing these experienced entrepreneurs in businesses - or using them as
co-investors in management buy-ins - venture capitalists should be
increasing the chances of the ventures' success.
A few accounting firms, such as Touche Ross, follow up or back successful
entrepreneurs but on a selective basis. And Mercury Asset Management helped
Michael Guthrie, former chairman of Mecca Leisure, to look for opportunities
in the food sector when he left Mecca after its takeover by Rank. But it
appears to be a piecemeal approach.
Even 3i, the UK's largest venture capital company, only keeps an informal
eye on entrepreneurs that have left companies it has backed. And it has no
systematic way of following up people who have sold businesses they started
without venture backing.
Of course, the experience of selling a company changes entrepreneurs. Robbie
points out from a study* of serial investors undertaken by CMBOR that
success does not necessarily breed success. 'Venture capitalists will need
to be satisfied that experienced entrepreneurs still have the motivation,
ambition and managerial skills to succeed in a subsequent venture,' he says.
Another change is that the entrepreneurs know the ropes and how to deal with
venture capital investors. John Edmonds is a classic example of a serial
investor who got wise to the ways of some venture capitalists and had the
muscle to be more discerning second-time around. A partner in a legal
practice, Edmonds developed an encyclopaedic knowledge of holiday time-share
law. In 1991 he left his firm and bought a US holiday company with Dollars
11m (Pounds 7m) of venture backing.
Eighteen months after turning it into a successful timeshare holiday
exchange bureau, Edmonds sold it for Dollars 75m. After a week he got bored
doing nothing. He began a year-long search to find another business before
reading an advertisement that led him to First Information Group, a
multimedia software company formerly called Chrysalis.
But while he was looking for his next move, no venture capitalists called
him - although he did invite himself to lunch at 3i.
He also decided not to return to the venture capitalists who backed his
time-share company. 'Lloyds Development Capital, in particular, was very
anxious to get an exit quickly and they put a lot of pressure on us to do
it,' says Edmonds.
Instead he turned to 3i because he believed they would not press him for an
exit. Yesterday he announced he had sold 25 per cent of First Information
Group to 3i for Pounds 4m, to finance production and marketing of its own
multimedia titles.
If the venture capital industry is in command when entrepreneurs first need
capital, there is little doubt the balance of power has changed when they
come back a second time. 'The second time around they (entrepreneurs) are
much more in the driving seat and more able to bargain,' says Robbie.
Take John Laurie, who led a Pounds 2.2m management buy-in at Newport
Technology group, a maker of electronic components. Having had experience
not only of being backed by venture capitalists but of providing seed
capital to small ventures, Laurie was able to structure the acquisition of
Newport Technology with very little venture backing.
Because Newport Technology Group was relatively lowly geared, Laurie was
able to use the assets within the company as security for bank loans,
thereby reducing the amount of equity he needed to sell to venture backers.
He did this by securing a so-called financial assistance statement from the
company's directors.
Such financial assistance statements can be granted by private companies
being acquired if the assistance does not reduce its net assets by more than
the amount it could lawfully pay out in dividends, or if the directors and
auditors can confirm the company will be able to pay its debts over the next
year.
Such mechanisms can reduce the amount of equity an entrepreneur needs to
sell to venture backers, according to Richard Kennett, a solicitor at
Laytons, who helped Laurie structure the deal. However, many first-time
entrepreneurs seeking venture capital may not be aware of this route.
This arrangement meant the venture capital backers had to come in as
ordinary shareholders with no special rights to dividends or performance
ratchets.
There is little doubt that investing behind or alongside entrepreneurs who
have done it before should increase the chances of a venture's success.
There again, if all seasoned entrepreneurs are as good negotiators as Laurie
perhaps it is not surprising that venture capitalists prefer greener
customers.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Touche pays Pounds 1.35m to settle 'negligence' case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, has paid about Pounds 1.35m in final
settlement of the ground-breaking Caparo case in which it was accused of
negligent auditing.
Mr Swraj Paul, owner of Caparo, the mini-conglomerate, said yesterday that
the money covered his costs in fighting a nine-year legal battle against the
auditors.
Caparo bought Fidelity, an electronics company, for Pounds 13.4m in 1985 and
subsequently discovered that it had overpaid because of alleged
overstatements in the accounts of stocks, sales and pre-tax profits.
It brought a case against the directors - Mr Steven Dickman and Mr Robert
Dickman - who have since become bankrupt, and also against Touche Ross,
auditors to Fidelity.
The Touche Ross case went to the House of Lords in 1990, where it set an
important and much-criticised legal precedent, which severely restricted the
'duty of care' that auditors had to users of accounts. The Lords said the
duty extended only to the company and to shareholders as a collective group.
Mr Paul was determined to continue his campaign to seek redress from the
auditors, and launched a second action structured to get round the Lords'
ruling.
The case, which was due to reach the courts in October, was brought against
Touche Ross in the name of Intersound Consumer Electronics, as Fidelity is
now called. Mr Paul said the size of the settlement was adequate as
Intersound could probably only have claimed damages equal to the size of
Touche's audit fees, because Intersound as a company gained from Caparo
overpaying for the acquisition.
The settlement, which was agreed last month, came without any admission of
liability, and neither party would comment on the size of the payments
involved yesterday.
Touche Ross said: 'We have reached an amicable settlement. Both sides
incurred substantial costs and the case has not yet even come to court. The
only people to make any money were the professional advisers helping each
side so it made sense to settle for commercial reasons.'

FT  02 AUG 94 / A sector awash with tides of deposits: Will building
societies be left high and dry?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although volatility is not a quality usually associated with building
society retail deposits, the picture given by the figures for society retail
funds in the first half of this year suggests a flood of investors rushing
in different directions.
Throughout the first quarter savers deserted societies, leaving them with a
net outflow of more than Pounds 1.3bn. In April and May they returned,
producing net inflows for the first time since October. However in June they
once again left societies with a net outflow of Pounds 104m.
With the summer holiday season under way, there is unlikely to be much of an
upturn in net receipts until the autumn.
Other institutions, however, have been competing hard for savers' money and
it remains to be seen how much the building societies will attract.
Unit trusts - pooled investment funds - which last year enjoyed their best
year ever, have registered even stronger private-investor buying this year.
Net retail sales in the first six months totalled Pounds 3.9bn, almost twice
the Pounds 2bn sold in the same period last year.
The investment-trust industry has also enjoyed a period of heavy demand.
One factor behind the attraction of unit and investment trusts, apart from
the climate of low interest rates, has been personal equity plans (Peps).
Most unit trusts are sold in the form of a Pep, which shelters gains from
income and capital gains tax. The Association of Unit Trusts and Investment
Funds estimates that the value of funds under management in unit-trust Peps
has grown to Pounds 10bn from Pounds 1.3bn in just three years.
Mr Philip Warland, director-general of the association, said that Peps,
which were first introduced in 1987, have proved an effective way to
introduce long-term savers to the stock market. 'These Pep figures are a
reflection of the increasing use of Peps to meet specific needs, such as
repaying a mortgage, paying school fees or topping up a person's savings for
retirement,' he said.
National Savings has also done well. In January, National Savings launched
the pensioners' guaranteed income bond, paying an interest rate of 7 per
cent gross fixed for five years for people aged 65 and over. It has been the
best-selling product each month since its launch, with the exception of last
month. It contributed well over half the net National Savings receipts of
Pounds 2.2bn in the first half, a spectacular increase on the Pounds 408m in
the first half of last year.
Premium bonds have also had a successful year following the decision by
National Savings to increase the first prize to Pounds 1m.
The fluctuations of savers' relationships with societies can be viewed in
two ways. On the positive side, Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the
Building Societies Association, said they were a sign that societies were
'the residual core base, from which funds are drawn for other forms of
saving'.
However, the figures suggest that societies have only a limited ability to
influence their own market share. If another form of savings is marketed or
priced aggressively, societies are likely to suffer, even if they react in
terms of the range of products they offer.
Even so, when interest automatically credited to accounts is included,
societies are well ahead of the banks in the value of personal deposits.
Societies notched up a Pounds 3.3bn increase in savings in the first half of
this year compared with a rise of Pounds 1.2bn in personal savings held in
banks.
Low interest rates are another factor. When rates are low - even on savings
accounts - customers are less inclined to bother moving. Mr John Ecklin,
statistics director at the British Bankers' Association, said: 'There is a
lot of lethargy out there.'

The Department of the Environment yesterday published detailed proposals for
handling compulsory competitive tendering in English local authorities which
are to be reorganised after the work of the Local Government Commission.
For services already covered by CCT, including housing management, the
requirement to put work out to tender will be largely lifted. Reorganised
authorities will not be subject to CCT for white-collar services until two
years after reorganisation.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A Court of Appeal ruling in the case of New Bullas Trading, a small
consulting company which went into receivership in 1991, has said for the
first time that banks other than clearing banks may take a fixed charge on
uncollected book debts.
The decision could encourage foreign and smaller banks to lend more,
particularly to service companies which have few fixed assets such as
premises and equipment.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Franchise system legal aid launched
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
About a quarter of legal-aid services in England and Wales will be provided
through the Legal Aid Board's new franchising operation, it was announced at
the scheme's official launch yesterday.
Mr Stephen Orchard, the board's chief executive, said about 1,000
solicitors' offices had had their applications to become franchisees
accepted.
Under the scheme, firms of solicitors which meet performance and management
criteria are awarded franchises by the board for particular areas of legally
aided work.
The scheme is intended to improve the delivery of legal services, but has
been criticised by some in the profession for being over-rigid in its
control and likely to undermine the freedom of solicitors to conduct cases
as they think best.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Bottles of fruit drink recalled
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Robinsons is recalling bottles of its apple and blackcurrant drink because
of fears they could burst after fermentation caused by the recent hot
weather.
The company said it was 'concerned that the fermentation could, under
extreme circumstances, result in pressure build-up causing bottles to
burst'.
The company said the drinks had been withdrawn as a precaution after the
discovery that there had been fermentation in a few bottles. The changes
were not a danger to health but care should be taken to remove the caps.
About 3m plastic bottles of the drink were being recalled.
Production at the Norwich plant had been halted until a solution could be
found. Other varieties of juice, including baby drinks, were unaffected.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Controversial demolition work almost finished
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The demolition of one of London's landmarks, the building at No 1 Poultry -
opposite the Bank of England - which included the former Mappin &amp; Webb
store, is virtually complete.
A controversial development, criticised by conservationists and likened by
Prince Charles to a 1930s wireless, is to be built in its place. The scheme,
designed by Sir James Stirling, is a joint venture by Lord Palumbo, former
chair-man of the Arts Council, and Mr Dieter Bock, the German financier and
joint chief executive of Lonrho. It took 35 years and two public inquiries
before Lord Palumbo won planning permission in 1989 to redevelop the site.
The project has involved the demolition of eight former listed properties
including the 125-year-old Mappin &amp; Webb store. Construction is due to be
finished by autumn 1996. John Laing construction group is the main
contractor for the project. The 110-ft development on six storeys will
comprise 125,000 sq ft of offices and 25,000 sq ft of shopping with a
150-seat rooftop restaurant and public gardens.
The site is rich in history and is expected to yield significant finds when
an archaeological dig starts this autumn.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Court to rule on stalling of Maxwell probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the largest accountancy firm, has been granted leave to
go to the courts in an effort to stall a wide-ranging professional
investigation into its audit of the Maxwell business empire.
If the ruling goes in the firm's favour it would be seen as a serious blow
to self-regulation of professional bodies.
The action follows the launch in May last year by the Joint Disciplinary
Scheme, the profession's most senior regulatory body, of an investigation
into pensions and related transactions within the Maxwell companies.
The attempt has been triggered by a precedent-setting judgment in April
which allowed Price Waterhouse to stall an investigation by the regulator of
PW's audit of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
The ruling - which was argued on the grounds that the BCCI case was highly
unusual and complex - meant that no inquiry could take place until civil and
criminal actions relating to the bank and its auditors were complete. This
is unlikely until the next century.
The Joint Disciplinary Scheme, which is operated by the UK's chartered and
certified accountancy bodies, only investigates matters of the most serious
public interest.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand said yesterday that it had formally requested suspension
of the inquiry in February 'on the basis that any such inquiry could be
prejudicial to justice'.
After the regulator refused this demand in March, Coopers formally requested
a review last month. It confirmed yesterday that it had been granted leave
to seek judicial review by Mr Justice Latham. No date has been set for a
hearing although it is expected to take place relatively soon.
A number of professional firms - both in accountancy and in other sectors -
have been reviewing the Price Waterhouse judgment in detail and considering
attempts to use similar stalling tactics.
Regulators had been expecting other firms to test the judgment more broadly,
and some are believed to welcome the chance to test its limits.
The regulator's case has not been helped because it has in the past delayed
the launch of several investigations. In the case of Polly Peck
International, it waited until this May, more than three years after the
collapse of the company, before launching its investigation.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Insurance watchdog says why he quit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Julian Farrand, who resigned as insurance ombudsman last Thursday and is
to be pensions ombudsman, yesterday called for his new office to be given
responsibility for complaints about personal pensions sold to people
transferring out of occupational schemes.
He also criticised the Personal Investment Authority, the controversial new
watchdog to protect the private investor. He said it had significantly
reduced the role of the insurance ombudsman by creating a new office of PIA
ombudsman.
Mr Farrand said yesterday that he had resigned as insurance ombudsman after
a long period of 'disillusionment' over the role's future.
He added: 'I preferred the challenge of being in a developed and enlarged
role to remaining in something with a diminishing significance.'
He said he had been searching for new appointments for some months as his
role had been increasingly squeezed by the expansion of the authority.
His resignation followed the news last Wednesday that his application to
become pensions ombudsman had been accepted. He takes over on September 1.
Mr Farrand had already hinted in evidence earlier this year to the Commons
Treasury committee that he was unhappy with the new structures being
implemented for the regulation of invest-ment.
One particularly contentious issue has been the fact that there is a ceiling
of Pounds 50,000 on the award the PIA ombudsman can make a
financial-services organisation pay. This compares with a maximum of Pounds
100,000 under the insurance-ombudsman scheme.
Mr Farrand said it remained unclear which body would take on the role of
dealing with complaints about pension transfers and opt-outs if the rulings
of the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, were not
accepted.
He said shifting this responsibility to the pensions ombudsman had 'some
sort of logic and clarity, and would be a little less confusing for the
consumer'.
While SIB has yet to publish its plans for dealing with compensation to
customers who have suffered as a result of poor advice to take a pension
transfer, there is little sign that it believes the pensions ombudsman is
best placed to take on this role.
SIB believes that most complaints will centre on the marketing side of
pensions rather than on their administration, and so would fall more to the
PIA ombudsman.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Prudential urges law shake-up in pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prudential Corporation has launched a campaign to lobby the government for
pension law to be simplified.
It is urging standardisation, perhaps on a statutory basis, of how to
calculate the value of a lump sum which might be transferred from a former
employer's pension scheme to a personal plan.
It argues also that personal pensions should be simplified to make them more
genuinely portable.
At the moment, for example, people with personal pensions who then move to
jobs where they can join a company scheme are unable to maintain their
personal pensions. They are, however, allowed to top up the occupational
scheme with free-standing additional voluntary contributions.
Although Prudential has considerable influence as the largest pension
provider, its image was tarnished recently by the leak of a paper from the
life industry's regulator indicating that it was the subject of an informal
investigation.
Its stance on pension transfers has also been criticised. While there are
cases it does not take because they do not make financial sense for the
customer, in other circumstances it behaves unlike other life insurers in
saying that it can give the customer only information and not advice on
whether to take a pension transfer, because the benefits of doing so are not
guaranteed.
On transfer values, Prudential said the difficulties arose from the scope in
existing arrangements for wide variations in the calculations. These
differences could prove decisive in the consideration of a pension transfer.
At present, actuaries have broad guidelines on how to take account of
inflation prospects, discretionary increases in benefits and expected
investment returns.
Prudential is organising a delegation of industry representatives and MPs to
discuss these issues with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, in the autumn.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Unions threaten BT with showdown on jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The three unions representing staff at British Telecommunications warned
yesterday that they would withdraw all co-operation if the company imposed
any compulsory redundancies over the next few years.
Their angry response followed disclosures by Sir Iain Vallance, BT's
chairman, to the Financial Times that the company intends to shed a further
50,000 jobs on top of 90,000 which have already gone through voluntary
severance over the past four years. Sir Iain made clear some job losses
might have to be compulsory to bring the workforce to 100,000.
The unions said yesterday: 'Over the past four years the BT unions have
co-operated in reducing staffing by an un-precedented 90,000 jobs while
supporting the company's commitment to maintain the highest quality of
service to customers.'
The three unions - the National Communications Union (NCU), the Union of
Communication Workers (UCW) and the Society of Telecom Executives (STE) -
added: 'This co-operation was conditional on any job losses being voluntary
and achieved through a combination of a voluntary release package and
redeployment opportunities.'
They did not threaten strike action but warned they were 'determined to
oppose any member of any union being made compulsorily redundant'. The STE
will be particularly hard hit by further job losses. The union, which
represents managers, is already committed by a conference decision to ballot
for industrial action if compulsory redundancies are announced. The company
wants to shed more than 6,000 of its 35,000 managers.
Union officials fear that BT may announce compulsory job losses among the
managerial grades later this month or in the early autumn.
The NCU, which represents staff below managerial level, has a written
understanding with BT that there will be no compulsory redundancies before
the end of this financial year. That union has made clear that any resort to
compulsion for job losses will lead to an immediate strike ballot.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Gloom on chemicals work prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chemicals industry in Cleveland has lost 5,300 jobs since 1981 and is
expected to shed up to 2,000 more by the year 2006, says a report to be
considered by county councillors tomorrow, Chris Tighe writes.
This would cut employment in the county's chemicals sector to 11,200.
Between 1981 and 1993, the chemicals industry's share of total employment in
Cleveland dropped from 9 per cent to 7 per cent.
Asset swaps, plant closures, demergers, selective acquisitions and more
flexible working arrangements have all had an impact on Cleveland as
chemical companies battle to keep a share of an increasingly competitive
industry, often by focusing on core activities, says the report.
The report, by the council's department of environment, development and
transportation, says the county does have some 'core' industries which are
performing well, but much of its employment is in the fluctuating bulk
chemicals sector. It also points to lack of local control as a weakness in
terms of job security.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Axe wielded by Treasury casts a long shadow: A look at the
departments facing spending cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, is not alone.
Several cabinet ministers can expect their departments' spending programmes
to be axed this year if Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is to carry out
his promise to cut public spending and pave the way for tax cuts before the
next election.
Six Whitehall departments - employment, transport, the two legal
departments, trade and industry, and environment - have recently been
examined in the Treasury's Fundamental Expenditure Reviews, which carry out
a root-and-branch examination of policies.
An additional four departments which were examined last year - social
security, the Home Office, health and education - have recently been put
under the spotlight again to see if more cuts can be made.
And, if all that were not enough, the Treasury has even examined
administrative spending by its own officials to see if savings can be made.
The outcome of some of these reviews has already been trailed. Mr Peter
Lilley, the social security secretary, is almost certain to introduce
reductions in spending on housing benefit and mortgage interest relief in an
effort to cut his department's Pounds 85bn budget. He confirmed earlier this
week that the DSS is to introduce identity cards for benefit recipients to
crack down on an estimated Pounds 5bn of fraud.
Lord MacKay, the Lord Chancellor, will probably be forced to reduce spending
on the administration of the courts and in the legal-aid budget. Some of the
work done by Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue is also likely to be
merged in a move which could cost hundreds of civil servants' jobs.
In recent months officials at these and other Whitehall departments have put
up a determined battle to ward off these cuts. The DTI pointed out yesterday
that its entire budget has already been reduced to just Pounds 1.4bn by
1996-97. 'Any cuts in our budget are unlikely to have much impact if the
Treasury is looking for sizeable cuts in next year's control total,' said
one official.
Some ministers have also argued that the need for cuts in public spending
could be offset by signs of economic recovery, which will reduce both the
amount of cyclical expenditure incurred by the government and the size of
state borrowing. But rightwing Tory MPs reject these arguments. They
question the determination of Mr Clarke to reduce the projected control
total expenditure of Pounds 263bn in 1995-96. They argue that the reviews of
health and education had little impact on last year's budget. They also say
that some measures, like the reform of invalidity benefit last year, will
only help to reduce spending in the long term.
Tory rightwingers also argue that there must be even more drastic reductions
in social security expenditure, whose budget accounts for nearly a third of
total public spending. They want a concerted move away from universal state
benefits, leaving more people dependent on private-pension provision.
They are concerned too, that the government is backing down from some of its
privatisation plans. Legislation on motorway tolling now looks unlikely to
be introduced in the next session of parliament amid signs that it could be
delayed until after the next election. And the privatisation of the Post
Office is still under threat from a concerted lobby of Tory moderates.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Commercial stations win more Radio 1 listeners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Commercial radio is continuing to eat into the BBC's audiences and now
accounts for 47.4 per cent of all radio listening in the UK.
The latest figures announced yesterday by Rajar, the official audience
research body for radio, compare with a share of 38.9 per cent for the
commercial sector in the same quarter a year ago.
The main factor in the change, apart from new commercial stations, has been
the drop in the audience for Radio 1. In the quarter to June 19, average
weekly listenership for the station fell to 12.2m compared with 15.6m a year
ago.
The loss of more than 3m listeners has followed the decision to 'reposition'
Radio 1 and concentrate more on public-service aims. This has involved
adding more speech, including poetry, drama, new comedy and current affairs
to the pop music mix.
At the same time commercial radio has attracted 2.9m new listeners - a 39
per cent swing to commercial radio in share of listening.
Ms Liz Forgan, managing director of BBC network radio, yesterday noted Radio
1's 'progress towards stabilisation by the end of the year'.
She added: 'We expect to see a continued slowdown in the rate of decline.'
In the past three quarters the rate of loss of regular listeners has come
down from 1.5m in the fourth quarter of last year to 880,000 in the quarter
to June.
Ms Forgan also warned yesterday that the competitive pressures for radio
audiences will increase. The third national commercial station, Talk Radio
UK, is due on air in February; five new regional stations will start
broadcasting this autumn, and further commercial stations are planned.
Between April and June gross advertising revenue for radio was Pounds 52.6m
 -a year-on-year-growth of 23.1 per cent.
Mr Douglas McArthur, chief executive of the Radio Advertising Bureau, which
promotes commercial radio, said that radio, once scorned as the '2 per cent
medium' had over the past year taken 4 per cent of all advertising.
However, over the past 12 months the overall reach of radio - those
listening at least at least once a week - dropped from 88 per cent to 87 per
cent, and average listening hours also declined.

FT  02 AUG 94 / M0 growth rate slows to 6.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A slowdown in the annual rate of growth of M0, the narrow measure of money
supply, provided some encouraging economic news for the Bank of England
ahead of the publication of its quarterly inflation report today.
The annual rate fell to a seasonally adjusted 6.5 per cent in July, from 6.9
per cent in June, according to figures released by the Bank yesterday. This
decline was smaller than analysts had expected and the annual rate remains
well above the government's 0 per cent to 4 per cent monitoring range.
Nevertheless the slowdown will be seen as good news by monetary authorities.
M0 is used as an inflationary indicator by the Treasury and the Bank of
England, and is seen as a reasonably accurate indicator of consumer
spending.
Mr Eddie George, the Bank governor, in the minutes of his monthly meeting on
June 8 with the Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, expressed concern about
rapid growth in M0.
The three-month annualised growth rate was described in the minutes as being
'uncomfortably high and the governor would be looking for it to decline in
the coming months'. Yesterday's figures show that the three-month annualised
rate fell to 6.5 per cent last month from 8.3 per cent in June.
Past explanations for the rapid growth in M0 have centred on the role of low
interest rates, which have reduced the effective costs to consumers of
holding cash. However, the authorities believe that this effect will
gradually disappear from the figures.
M0 grew 0.7 per cent between June and July, but part of this was because of
a sharp rise in bankers' operational deposits. The less volatile notes and
coins component grew a seasonally adjusted 0.4 per cent last month for an
annual rate of 6.5 per cent, down from 6.7 per cent in June.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Swan takeover talks make slow progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Iskandar Safa, the sole prospective bidder for Swan Hunter as a going
concern, yesterday arrived for talks aimed at saving the Tyneside
shipbuilder from closure. Although the talks in London were described as
constructive they ended inconclusively after more than four hours, Chris
Tighe writes.
The meeting between Price Waterhouse, the receiver, and Mr Safa, principal
shareholder of Soffia, the parent company of patrol boat builder
Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie, was organised by shipyard unions.
This was after Price Waterhouse said CMN's offer - in which Pounds 3.5m is
guaranteed - was well below Swans' Pounds 7.5m break-up value.
The two sides indicated it would be two to three weeks before it would be
clear whether agreement could be reached. This would make it impossible to
achieve the deadline of noon tomorrow, set by the Ministry of Defence, for
placing the Pounds 6m, three-month refit of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary tanker
Olwen with Swan Hunter.
An industrial tribunal in Newcastle upon Tyne today begins a test case
hearing at which unions representing former Swans employees will contest the
Department of Employment's handling of payments made following an award by a
tribunal last year. The award was to compensate 430 workers, made redundant
just after the receivers' arrival in May last year, for the lack of a 90-day
consultative period. However many of the workers received little or no
payout.
The unions are challenging the employment department's decision to base its
calculations on eight weeks rather than 12, and to deduct money paid in lieu
of notice and wage arrears payments.

FT  02 AUG 94 / RMT claims new move in rail row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Financial Times Reporters
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The RMT transport union last night said that it had made fresh moves in the
rail dispute in talks at Acas, the conciliation service.
It said: 'We've made further proposals to Railtrack through Acas. There has
been a response made from Railtrack which to some extent raises more
questions than it answers. Both sides are now reflecting on the position.'
But the union dismissed hopes of an immediate resolution, saying that
nothing in the day's negotiations could be regarded as 'a dramatic
breakthrough'.
The latest national strike in the union's dispute with the state-owned
Railtrack company is due to start at noon tomorrow and last 24 hours.
The company expects more than a third of the network to run normally during
this week's disruption.
Trains are expected to run this week from London's Waterloo to Guildford,
Surrey, and to Yeovil in Somerset for the first time during the strikes.
This morning the union's leadership will announce plans for next week with a
possible move to a 48-hour period of dis-ruption.
On Thursday the result of the union's ballot of its supervisors will be
announced, and if this produces a majority in support for industrial action
in sympathy with the signalling staff they could join any planned strikes
after August 11.
Railway signal workers in south-west England were yesterday discussing
whether to accept an informal local offer of lump sums, said to be up to
Pounds 800 each, in return for working during strikes ordered by the RMT.
Railtrack said the reported 'offer' to signal workers in some areas was
nothing more than a repackaging of money 'which has always been on the
table'.

FT  02 AUG 94 / MMC to put more work out to tender
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission is to develop further the selective
contracting out of its work on references and demonstrate more fully how it
spends public money.
The changes follow a review commissioned by the government from Price
Waterhouse, the management consultants, on the MMC's financial management.
Price Waterhouse made a number of recommendations on how the management of
the commission's work could be improved. Overall, however, these will not
change greatly the way the commission works.
Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said the review had concluded
that the commission had been effective in its role as an investigative body
and had carried out its responsibilities 'in an independent, professional
and fair manner'.
One of the most important improvements will be the publication of annual
accounts from 1995-96 in addition to the regular annual review.
The commission will also be increasing the contracting-out of reference
work. It said yesterday it had always used outside contractors, but was
bringing its practices fully into line with European Union rules on open
bidding for public contracts.
Mr Hamilton said the commission would also improve liaison with the Office
of Fair Trading to minimise duplicate burdens on businesses.
The commission employs about 90 staff and has an annual budget of Pounds
5.5m.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Persil wars go to adverts watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Advertising Standards Authority yesterday became the latest battleground
in the soap wars between Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble.
Lever Brothers, UK detergents subsidiary of the Anglo-Dutch group Unilever,
wrote to the authority complaining about newspaper advertisements taken out
by Procter which criticise Unilever's new-generation soap powder.
The detergent, which recently went on the market in the UK as Persil Power,
contains a manganese-based ingredient, which Unilever calls the
'accelerator'. Procter claims that independent tests show the accelerator
can damage some fabrics, causing fading and holes.
The advertisements, first seen in Saturday's newspapers, do not name Persil
Power but are, said Lever, a clear attack on the product. One version of the
advertisement states that 'Only Ariel (Procter's rival product) washes so
clean yet so safe' and stresses that Ariel 'does not contain' the
accelerator. Another version makes similarly unfavourable comparisons
between another Procter product, Fairy, and Persil Power.
Procter also alleges in the advertisements that the manganese stays in
clothes after washing and so could damage fabrics even if consumers switch
to another brand.
Lever said yesterday that Procter's advertising campaign was
'unprecedented'. Mr Tim Hammond, Lever's fabrics marketing director, said it
was essential to put the record straight not only for the company's benefit,
but for the industry as a whole.
The complaint to the authority challenges Procter's claims that its products
are superior as well as questioning the basis of the tests referred to, and
substantiation for the 'carry-over' effect of the manganese.
Unilever said its own laboratory tests show that Persil Power is both safe
and effective. Mr Hammond said: 'The charges add nothing new. The
advertising campaign is part of a continuing attempt to clear the ground
prior to their own product launch in September. Time is running out for them
because, far from rejecting Persil, consumers across the country are buying
and using it in even greater quantities.'
Procter is due to launch its own new-generation powder, Ariel Future, in
Germany in the autumn. The new detergent will not contain manganese.
Results of tests on Persil Power by the independent Consumers' Association
are not expected for 10 weeks. Marks and Spencer, which is conducting its
own examination of the powder, has yet to decide whether to make the results
public.
It is likely that an investigation by the advertising watchdog will take
some weeks.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Advertising campaigns promoting official government policy - and often
coinciding with the aims of the Conservative party - cost the taxpayer
Pounds 73m in the last financial year, Mr Matthew Taylor, the Liberal
Democrat MP for Truro, said yesterday.
He called for an inquiry into the usefulness of government advertising and
the need for effective monitoring to deter waste.
Mr Taylor, who is in charge of his party's campaigns and communications
unit, said it was a 'scandal' that it had cost Pounds 1,007 for each
response received to an advertising campaign encouraging people to work in
the health service.
Market research had shown that a Pounds 400,000 campaign encouraging tenants
to become owner-occupiers through the rent-to-mortgage scheme was not
successful.
Mr Taylor also attacked the Department of Employment for the advertisement
campaign for its Jobfinder grants which, in the case of the west Midlands,
cost Pounds 49 for every Pounds 100 grant eventually awarded.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Unions stand firm in countdown to confrontation: A look at
the mood in Nigeria as military leaders face up to a test of strength
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nigeria yesterday began the countdown to a threatened confrontation, as the
country's military rulers weighed their response to trade union demands to
release detained opposition leader Moshood Abiola or face a general strike
from tomorrow.
While many feared increased violence, rumours spread last night that the
military may release Mr Abiola to defuse the strike threat. The leaders of
the country's armed forces held a meeting in Abuja, the capital, as the test
of strength with strikers loomed.
A strike by oil workers has already seen Nigeria's production of oil cut by
a fifth, adding to the strains of the struggling economy.
The streets of central Lagos, Nigeria's main city, normally jammed with
traffic, were almost empty yesterday except for thousands of workers
beginning a long walk home.
Buses were off the road, banks were closing, traders locked up their stalls
early. Motorists gave up the search for scarce petrol and abandoned their
cars in the long queues outside filling stations to avoid the clashes
between street gangs and armed police which have broken out in Lagos Island
in the last week.
'It is difficult to tell who are real strikers and real demonstrators
because these protests are often taken over by area boys (the Lagos term for
the young thugs who steal and extort from the public),' says a businessman
in Lagos.
The pro-democracy groups and trade unions are using threats to back up their
appeals for the private sector not to break the strike. Commercial banks
that employ non-union staff are taking seriously last week's anonymous
letters threatening reprisals against strike breakers.
Since June when General Sani Abacha's regime arrested Mr Abiola for claiming
the presidency a year after his unofficial victory in an election annulled
by the military, the government has tried everything except compromise, and
their support in the armed forces and among sympathetic trade union leaders
is fast declining.
There is growing concern in Nigeria and abroad that the power tussle, which
has ethnic undertones, could degenerate into civil war like the one over
Biafra in the late 1960s. More than 1m Nigerians died in that conflict.
The head of Nigeria's Anglican Church, Archbishop Abiodun Adetiloye, urged
Nigerians to stand firm.
'Some suffering now will usher in a brighter tomorrow and will help to end
tyranny, oligarchy, apartheid, dictatorship and illegality,' a statement
from the church quoted the archbishop, a southerner, as saying. 'Nigeria
belongs to all Nigerians irrespective of place of birth or religious
belief,' he added.
The generals in Abuja face a choice between dialogue and getting tough. The
doves are represented by the second in command, Lt Gen Oladipo Diya, and the
hawks' line has been kept in the ascendant by the most influential civilian,
secretary to the government Mr Aminu Saleh.
Support for the unions and democracy campaigners is not universal in
Nigeria. The four-week oil workers' strike has not been observed by union
members in the north, where Kaduna oil refinery is operating normally. The
east of Nigeria has seen much less disruption than the south-west. But civil
unrest and strikes in the south brought down Gen Ibrahim Babangida, the last
military head of state, last August and enabled Gen Abacha to ease out the
short-lived civilian interim government in November.
The present regime looks vulnerable but the chorus of opposition to military
rule in Nigeria and abroad may, some western diplomats argue, have reduced
the chances of another military coup, for no would-be successor to Gen
Abacha can be in any doubt that only a handover to civilians will satisfy
domestic expectations or international demands.
Others are less sanguine, for some officers may see Gen Abacha as part of
the problem unless he rapidly comes up with a political solution.
The views of the US, the dominant international influence on Nigeria, were
expressed by Rev Jesse Jackson after his visit there last week: military
rule is unacceptable to Nigeria's friends and trading partners abroad and
isolation or punitive measures will increase until there is civilian
government.
Whether this threat can be put into practice is another matter. Nigeria gets
little aid, export credit facilities are minimal and it is not self-evident
that an oil embargo - even assuming UN approval - would bring the desired
result.
For the people in the Yoruba dominated south-west, civilian rule means their
kinsman, Mr Abiola, as president, possibly heading a coalition to heal the
regional divisions widened by the political crisis. The National Democratic
Coalition, which pushed Mr Abiola into the forefront earlier this year,
wants such a government to call a national conference which would try to
re-distribute power and wealth and end the string of military coups since
independence in 1960.
The more pressure builds up the harder the government seems to find it to
compromise. 'They seem inflexible. Everyone knows that releasing Abiola is
the answer,' says a military expert in Lagos. 'But nearly 30 years in power
have made the military arrogant. They will not bend to the will of
civilians.'
If the government chooses the hard line, a state of emergency, curfews and
troops on the streets could soon be in place and the dark warnings of
bloodshed by Mr Jackson could be realised. The deciding factor may be the
message from the commanding officers about the loyalty of the army if called
upon to fight civilians.
Delegates at the constitutional conference, who have shown no sympathy for
Mr Abiola's cause, have decided to mediate, urging Gen Abacha to release Mr
Abiola. 'A little clemency could defuse the tension,' says one delegate.
Yet for millions in Lagos and the south-west there already seems a widening
divide between them and the military regime associated with the Hausa-Fulani
north. Few in Lagos believe that the soldiers in Abuja can bridge that
increasingly dangerous divide.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Hussein adamant on role in future of Jerusalem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW GOWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
King Hussein of Jordan sought yesterday to capitalise on the accord he
signed last week with Israel by reaffirming his determination to play a role
in the future of Jerusalem, the most sensitive issue in Arab-Israeli peace
negotiations.
He said he had received several invitations to visit the city, claimed by
Israelis and Palestinians as their capital, and that he intended to go there
and to the West Bank 'before too long'.
'I feel it is my right as a Moslem and a Hashemite and an Arab to visit
Jerusalem and Hebron (in the West Bank),' he said. 'When I do so, I will not
ask anybody's permission.'
His statement, made to a group of journalists at his residence outside
London, will reignite protests among Palestinians and other Arab leaders
over the Israeli-Jordanian peace declaration, which refers to Jordan's
'present special role' in administering Moslem holy sites in Jerusalem.
In particular, it will fuel the already intense suspicion among Palestinians
that King Hussein, who does not attempt to conceal his disdain for the
Palestine Liberation Organisation, is trying to recreate a power base in the
territories he lost to Israel in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
The PLO is establishing a Palestinian self-governing authority in the West
Bank town of Jericho and in the Gaza Strip. Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman,
has vowed repeatedly to go and pray in Jerusalem since his return to the
area last month.
King Hussein acknowledged that the PLO, not Jordan, would be negotiating
with Israel over Jerusalem's political future.
But he went on to affirm his family's historic role in the city, saying he
wanted to depoliticise the Jerusalem issue and promote dialogue between
representatives of its three great religions.
The Jordanian monarch was in high spirits following the Washington accord.
He said he was thinking of submitting its final outcome to a national
referendum in Jordan.
He expressed optimism about rapid progress in resolving outstanding issues
with Israel and about the prospects for progress in parallel negotiations
between Israel and Syria. He added: 'I have never felt as much at peace with
myself as I do now.'
But he also sounded a grim note about the continuing threat of terrorist
violence such as the recent bomb attacks against Jewish targets in Buenos
Aires and London. 'We have to brace ourselves for more of that, until such
time as there is a tremendous change throughout the region,' he said.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Tourists return to more peaceful Egypt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Three months free of Islamic militant attacks on tourist targets has
encouraged a recovery in Egypt's tourist industry, with Cairo hotels
enjoying their highest occupancy rates in more than two years.
Latest tourism ministry figures show a 4.5 per cent rise in visitors in May
against the same month last year, the first overall rise since militant
groups began attacks on tourist buses, cruise boats and other tourist
targets in late 1992. Hoteliers say the recovery has strengthened since
then.
The last attacks against tourist targets came in March, when a few trains
were raked with gunfire as they passed through Assiut, a heartland of
militant activity in southern Egypt. A German tourist died from injuries
after gunmen fired at a Nile cruiser passing by Assiut.
Since April the government has repeatedly claimed its crackdown has
succeeded in breaking the main militant groups, the Gamaa al-Islamiyya and
Jihad, and prevented them operating outside their traditional strongholds in
Upper Egypt. Mr Hassan al-Alfie, interior minister, said last week: 'We have
managed to encircle them and put an end to the acts of violence.'
Mr Tony Baldry, parliamentary under-secretary at the Foreign Office, said
during a recent visit to Egypt that he had 'every impression this was a
situation which has been contained, understood, and dealt with'.
The lull in violence has encouraged tourism in Cairo, where five-star hotels
report occupancy rates of between 85-90 per cent against an average of
little over 50 per cent this time last year. 'There's been an
extraordinarily good improvement,' said Mr Richard Bousfield, marketing
director at the Cairo Semiramis Intercontinental.
The bulk of Cairo's summer visitors are Gulf Arabs. Hoteliers and tour
operators in Europe say it remains too early to forecast whether European,
American and other tourists will return in large numbers during the winter
season, which begins in October.
However, some hotels say provisional tour bookings for next season are
already twice what they were a year ago.
'Bookings are looking good; they're up for August and early September, and I
sense already that European tour operators are beginning to respond,' said
Mr Armin Shrocker, manager of the Nile Hilton hotel.
Egypt attracted a record 3.2m tourists in 1991-92 before the militant
attacks, garnering hard-currency earnings calculated by the government at
about Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.9bn). It says the anti-tourism violence,
designed by the Gamaa al-Islamiyya militant group to attack the government
by harming the economy, cost Dollars 900m in lost revenues last year,
hitting employment and investment in what had been Egypt's fastest-growing
industry.
However, diplomats and other commentators are cautious about forecasting an
end to militant violence. Moreover, the Egyptian government faces a
considerable security test in early September, when Cairo will attract
around 20,000 participants, including prime ministers, to the United Nations
International Conference on Population and Development.
On Sunday the Gamaa al-Islamiyya broke a silence of more than two and a half
months by issuing a faxed statement declaring it intended to step up
violence in the Upper Egyptian town of Mallawi, 270km south of Cairo, where
it claimed its members had ambushed and wounded two policemen.

<TEXT>
Mr John Elliott, the former head of the Elders IXL brewing and agro-business
group, was at the centre of sham foreign exchange payments of ADollars 66.5m
(Pounds 31.9m), Melbourne Magistrates' Court was told yesterday.
The alleged transactions occurred in the late 1980s, the court was told on
the first day of a committal hearing into whether Mr Elliott should stand
trial for allegedly defrauding Elders. Mr Elliott was one of Australia's
more colourful 1980s entrepreneurs, known for setting out to 'Fosterise the
world' after Elders took over Carlton and United Breweries, makers of
Foster's Lager, in the mid-1980s.
Mr Elliott and former Elders executives Mr Peter Scanlon and Mr Ken Biggins
each faces two counts of theft and one of conspiracy to defraud shareholders
and creditors of the company.
Another former executive, Mr Peter Cann, faces one count each of theft and
conspiracy.
Charges against a fifth former executive, Mr Kenneth Jarrett, were dropped
last month after he agreed to plead guilty to deceiving the Elders board,
and to give evidence against Mr Elliott during the committal hearings.
Two Sydney bankers working for the Bank of New Zealand at the time of the
alleged transactions also face charges of conspiracy to defraud.
The charges relate to foreign exchange transactions in 1988 between Elders
and the Bank of New Zealand and companies associated with a New Zealand
businessman, Mr Alan Hawkins, then head of the investment group Equitycorp.
The court heard the defendants had shareholders believe the transactions
resulted in losses to Elders of ADollars 39.5m and ADollars 27m
respectively.
The hearing is expected to last at least three months, mostly without Mr
Elliott and the other main defendants present.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South African Deputy President F W de Klerk yesterday dismissed speculation
that his National party planned to pull out of the country's coalition
government of national unity, saying that the party's aim was to prove that
consensus government could succeed.
Persistent reports that backbench MPs wanted the National party to withdraw
from the coalition cabinet have unsettled financial markets and shaken
confidence in the three-month-old government.
Some MPs have complained that the party, which is a junior partner in a
coalition dominated by the African National Congress, should act as a
traditional opposition party rather than merely appearing to endorse ANC
decisions.
Mr de Klerk dismissed such speculation, saying some MPs might advocate
withdrawal but the party caucus had never discussed the issue.
The NP, which ruled South Africa alone for 46 years, fought to ensure the
country's new constitution would enforce coalition government, rather than
allowing the majority party to rule alone. Under the constitution, all
parties that won more than 5 per cent of the vote in April's elections are
entitled to proportional representation in cabinet.
But the NP is struggling to define a role for itself within the new cabinet.
Mr de Klerk acknowledged that this meant 'walking the tightrope' between
classic opposition and subservience to the majority party. So far, he said,
he had deliberately taken a low profile within government, where he is
second deputy president after Mr Thabo Mbeki of the ANC. But he was now
'firing on all cylinders'.
Political violence has risen again in KwaZulu/Natal province, with 22 dead
at the weekend. Some of the killings were believed to be linked to
Saturday's screening of the controversial TV series The Line, which the
Inkatha Freedom party has complained is biased against Inkatha.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Nigerian strike brings big oil price rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oil prices yesterday rose above Dollars 19 a barrel for the first time in
more than a year as markets reacted to fears of further production cuts in
Nigeria.
The decision by striking Nigerian oil unions to boycott planned talks
yesterday with the military government triggered the latest price rises.
The benchmark Brent Blend for September closed in London at Dollars 19.18 a
barrel, its highest price for 15 months and 57 cents up on its Friday close.
The two main Nigerian oil unions, Nupeng and Pergasson, are demanding the
release from custody of Mr Moshood Abiola, the apparent winner of last
year's presidential election, as a condition for returning to work. Mr
Abiola is being tried for treason.
The unions have also demanded an end to widespread corruption in the
industry and improved conditions.
Shell, the largest foreign oil company operating in Nigeria, accounted for
about half of Nigeria's output of 1.95m barrels a day before the strike by
petroleum workers began more than three weeks ago. Yesterday it said output
at its fields was down by more than a third from normal levels.
The biggest fall in production is thought to be at the onshore oil fields of
Forcados and Bonny. Shell and the other western oil companies active in
Nigeria are thought to be concentrating their efforts to maintain offshore
production.
Although Nigeria accounts for only 3 per cent of world oil production, about
1.6m barrels of its 1.95m barrels of normal daily output is exported, mainly
to the US.
Nigerian supply disruptions coincide with rising world demand for oil and
high rates of capacity utilisation. Experts estimate there is only 2m-3m
barrels a day of unused production capacity in the world.
The possibility of a complete cut-off of Nigerian supplies from world
markets is low, according to Mr Joe Stanislaw, of Cambridge Energy Research
Associates in Paris. 'But the theoretical possibility of it happening is
having a significant psychological effect on relatively firm oil markets.'
Mr Peter Gignoux of US brokerage house Smith Barney, said the 'cohesive and
aggressive behaviour' of the Nigerian unions had taken many international
oil traders and companies by surprise.

Mr de Klerk dismissed such speculation, saying some MPs might advocate

The NP had no intention of leaving the government unless there were 'serious
disagreements on fundamental matters,' he told a press conference, adding
that the party would seek to avoid confrontation.
The NP, which ruled South Africa alone for 46 years, fought to ensure the
country's new constitution would en-force coalition government, rather than
allowing the maj-ority party to rule alone. Under the constitution, all
parties that won more than 5 per cent of the vote in April's elections are
entitled to proportional representation in cabinet.
The principle of enforced coalition government was accepted by the ANC in
constitutional negotiations and will not be lightly abandoned by the NP now.
But the party is struggling to define a role for itself within the new
cabinet.
Mr de Klerk acknowledged that this means 'walking the tightrope' between
classic opposition and subservience to the majority party. So far, he said,
he had deliberately taken a low profile within government, where he is
second deputy president after Mr Thabo Mbeki of the ANC. But he was now
'firing on all cylinders'.
However, the party's position in government has been weakened by the
resignation, as from October, of finance minister Derek Keys, an NP member,
who is to be replaced by Mr Chris Liebenberg, who does not belong to any
party.
Political violence has risen again in KwaZulu/Natal province, with 22 dead
at the weekend. Local violence monitors said they believed some of the
killings were linked to Saturday's screening of the controversial TV series
The Line, which the Inkatha Freedom party has complained is biassed against

A further sign of revival in the Japanese economy came yesterday with
figures for vehicle sales in July which showed a rise from a year earlier
for the second successive month, the first time this had been achieved since
October 1990.
Total vehicle sales were up 2.4 per cent with cars ahead 1.5 per cent,
according to the Japan Automobile Dealers Association. Truck sales were up
4.6 per cent, their fifth monthly gain in a row.
For the calendar year so far, however, vehicle sales remained 3 per cent
below levels of the first seven months of 1993. And elsewhere in Japanese
industry, positive data remained hard to come by.
Construction orders for June, announced yesterday by the Japan Federation of
Construction Contractors, were down 3.4 per cent from a year before, the
17th consecutive decline. The federation noted, however, that orders from
manufacturers were up 8.7 per cent.
Orders from the private sector as a whole fell 3.1 per cent while public
sector orders were down a sharp 12.9 per cent, reflecting the delay in the
passage of the annual budget brought about by the country's political
turmoil.

<TEXT>
Leaders of South Pacific island nations, meeting in Brisbane for the annual
forum, yesterday agreed to consider ways of rationalising the national
airline services which pepper the region.
In a formal statement, issued after the first day of discussions between the
heads of 15 South Pacific countries, members acknowledged that there was a
need to deal with airline losses.
They pledged to set up a meeting between airline operators and aviation
authorities, and to 'examine the options for a rationalisation of air
services among Forum island countries, perhaps on a sub-regional basis'.
The move will be welcomed by Australia, whose annual aid contribution to the
area is about ADollars 500m (Pounds 238m). At the weekend, Mr Gordon Bilney,
Australia's federal minister with responsibility for Pacific Island affairs,
made clear his country was increasingly reluctant to see aid funds used to
prop up the region's 11 national carriers.
In a separate initiative, Mr Paul Keating, the Australia's prime minister,
pledged additional financial assistance to the Solomon Islands, if it banned
logging of tropical rainforests on all government land in the Marovo Lagoon
area.
Environmental damage from logging by foreign companies, notably Malaysian
interests, has been of growing international concern.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Palestinian and Israeli economic negotiators yesterday finally completed
agreements for implementing their economic protocol that will allow
Palestinian agricultural produce to be officially imported into Israel from
today for the first time since 1967.
Palestinian officials had complained that Israel was dragging its feet in
implementing the agreement, signed in Paris three months ago, to put
political pressure on the Palestine Liberation Organisation and give it time
to take measures to protect Israeli farmers who will be adversely affected
by Palestinian competition.
Under the protocol, Israel and the PLO agreed to a free movement of
agricultural produce except for six goods - poultry, eggs, potatoes,
cucumbers, melons and tomatoes - which will be subject to a phased quota
over five years.
Israel says the delay in implementing the agreement has been the need to
agree procedures, license trucks and ensure Palestinian exports were subject
to veterinary and plant protection measures, to maintain health standards
and prevent the spread of disease.
These procedures were finalised yesterday, but Palestinian agricultural
negotiators complained Palestinian exporters will be subject to a myriad
licenses and inspections. 'We want the trade to be more free,' one
Palestinian official said. 'Let Israeli and Palestinian producers compete
freely on price and quality. There is still too much bureaucracy.'
The two sides also discussed snags in implementing trade, labour, customs
and direct taxation provisions of the economic protocol. Implementing the
agreement will boost the economy of the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
particularly agriculture, which accounts for 40 per cent of GDP. Before the
agreement, Palestinian produce was smuggled into Israel, but only in limited
quantities.
Yesterday's talks came as Israeli and Palestinian negotiators in Cairo tried
to finalise agreement for the transfer of civilian powers in the West Bank.
The two sides are near agreement to transfer authority in five areas -
education, health, direct taxation, tourism and social welfare - from the
Israeli military-run civil administration to the Palestinian national
authority.
Once completed, both sides will negotiate a framework for Palestinian
elections, due on October 15, and redeployment of Israeli troops out of
Palestinian population centres in the West Bank.
Mr Nabil Shaath, chief PLO negotiator, said he expected an agreement on the
transfer of powers by next week. But Israeli negotiators said the talks were
moving slowly because of concerns over how the Palestinians would pay for
the services they are going to take over.
An Israeli official said Israel feared a slump in revenues during the
transition period, and wanted to ensure enough funds to prevent a decline in
services, and social unrest.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A privately owned US truck parts maker which has never exported to Japan has
found itself side-swiped in the duel between the trade juggernauts of Tokyo
and Washington, Gordon Cramb writes from Tokyo.
Johnson Industries, based in Urbana, Ohio, was accused by Japanese media
yesterday of pulling out at the last minute after 18 months of negotiations
aimed at supplying Hino Motors, Japan's leading truck maker, with a
component to make its vehicles lighter and thus more fuel-efficient.
The reason for its withdrawal being put about in Tokyo was that the US
economy was now so buoyant that Johnson felt able to reject Hino's order.
The shipment would have been for some 10,000 units worth a total of perhaps
Dollars 1m.
Growth in the US has been running at a rather faster lick than in Japan. The
implication of the disclosure was that US companies need no longer bother
cutting deals with unfamiliar Japanese customers, because they have more
than enough demand at home. Japan's record bilateral trade surplus would
therefore remain undented by the pick-up in the US economy.
Johnson, although it supplies three of the six biggest US truck makers, is a
family-held company which had sales last year estimated at Dollars 25m and
employs 250 people - more than one in every hundred in Urbana. Hino, an
affiliate of Toyota, Japan's biggest car maker, has annual revenues of
Y535.5bn (Dollars 5.4bn) and more than 9,000 staff.
In Tokyo a Hino official confirmed yesterday that Johnson had withdrawn in
May from negotiations to supply aluminium air reservoir tanks for braking
systems, and that his company had turned to domestic suppliers instead.
But he added that Hino had no hand in revealing the breakdown two months
late. Mr Greg Moore, Johnson vice president, said the potential supplier had
been working on an air tank design but that 'the product we were offering
was not matching the specifications they were asking for, and there was a
mismatch. Time ran out for us as a supplying manufacturer.'
He added that his company 'couldn't reach a final contract' for a delivery
which was due in November. 'The way we left it, we needed a new design,' he
added, saying Johnson believed talks on possible future collaboration could
continue.
The saga of the failed talks between Hino and an unnamed Ohio supplier was
aired on Sunday night by Japan's NHK public television network, and other
news media in Tokyo yesterday fingered Johnson as the component maker which
stood Hino up 'because of surging demand by US automakers' in a decision
which came 'despite long-standing US pressure on Japan to buy more autos and
auto parts' from American companies.
Hino would suffer as a result, the reports suggested, because it would not
be able to switch so soon away from the heavier steel reservoir tanks it had
previously used. The Japanese company insisted yesterday, however, that it
would not be adversely affected and had not sought to publicise the
incident.
Nor certainly had Johnson, which said merely that like many possible deals
explored between companies across the world operating in the same sector,
'it had never reached the final specifications'.

FT  02 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Canada and US draw up wheat peace plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The US and Canada yesterday announced a preliminary agreement to avert a
damaging trade war over Canadian wheat exports, with Canada agreeing to curb
its wheat sales into the US market for a year.
The pact still must be approved by the Canadian and US cabinets, which are
to take it up today. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said the
details would not be announced until final agreement was reached.
'The agreement addresses the immediate problem of a surge in imports of
Canadian grain, while also establishing a process and a reasonable time
frame for addressing on a longer-term basis problems in the grains sector,'
he said.
The pact comes two weeks after a finding by the International Trade
Commission that Canada's 5m tonnes of US wheat sales had done some damage to
the US farm programme. The six commissioners differed widely on the extent
of the damage, with three saying the harm had been minimal and probably
transitory.
Under US law, President Bill Clinton can impose tariffs or quotas on
products found to damage the price support programme. He also has the option
of doing nothing.
But politics has been driving the issue, in the form of three key Democratic
senators from wheat-growing states on the powerful finance committee
insisting Canada unfairly subsidises its wheat.
US farmers themselves receive billions of dollars in grain subsidies.
One of the senators - Mr Max Baucus, chairman of the international trade
subcommittee - said the pact would sharply limit exports from current levels
both on durum wheat and other wheat and would 'go a long way toward
stabilising prices'.
The preliminary agreement has three parts. First, the US one-year import
curb officially began yesterday. Mr Kantor said it would result in 'a
substantial reduction in wheat imports'. That would have happened in any
case, since the 5m tonnes imported in 1993-94 was spurred by unusual
weather-related problems in both the US and Canada which are absent this
year.
The two sides also have agreed to a 12-month 'peace clause' on grains trade
to ensure against 'additional restrictions or countermeasures', with both
countries committed not to take action inconsistent with the North American
Free Trade Area pact or the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
They also agreed to create a joint commission on grains, composed of 6-10
private sector representatives, to study each country's marketing and farm
support systems over the next year. It will seek a longer-term solution to
the grains trade dispute. Its recommendations will not be binding.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Francois Leotard, the French defence minister, yesterday flew to Qatar to
seal an unusual triangular deal involving the Gulf state buying a dozen
Mirage 2000-5 jets from France and selling the same number of the
older-generation, French-made Mirage F1 fighters to Spain.
Dassault, which makes the Mirages, said yesterday it was awaiting an
official communique from the French and Qatari governments before
commenting.
But according to French press and diplomatic reports in Qatar, the deal
would meet Qatar's desire to update its air force with Mirage 2000-5s, in
service with the French air force but so far only ordered by Taiwan, and
Spain's need for a stop-gap reinforcement of its air force, which is
awaiting delivery of the long-delayed Eurofighter.
Spain remains a member of the four-nation Eurofighter programme, delayed by
German hesitations and financial problems, but in the interim wants to
increase the number of its front-line fighters.
Spurning a US offer of F-16 fighters, Madrid has decided to add to the 50
Mirage F-1s it already possesses by taking a dozen second-hand ones from
Qatar and paying for five more direct from France by giving Paris a couple
of CN-235 transport aircraft.
Newspaper reports said Spain would pay some Dollars 130m for the old
aircraft.
The sale of new Mirages to Qatar and second-hand ones to Spain will provide
a welcome boost to the French arms industry, which last year saw its exports
fall 32.5 per cent in value, after the 20 per cent increase posted in 1992,
thanks to Taiwan's order of 60 Mirage 2000-5s. In addition to Dassault,
Thomson and Sagem are expected to win the contract to fit new avionic
equipment in the Mirage F-1s for Spain.
The Matra defence arm of the Lagardere group yesterday announced that it had
won a FFr1.5bn (Dollars 280m) contract to equip the Mirages with Mica and
Magic missiles for Qatar.

<TEXT>
Argentina and Brazil have overcome the principal obstacle to the
implementation of Mercosur - the planned four-nation customs union that also
includes Paraguay and Uruguay - by reaching a compromise on the trade pact's
future common external tariffs.
Economy and foreign ministers from Argentina and Brazil, meeting near Buenos
Aires at the weekend, drew up a detailed pact on the customs union planned
to come into force on January 1 next year.
The presidents of the four countries will meet in Buenos Aires on Friday for
a summit at which they are expected to approve the compromise.
A dispute between Argentina and Brazil - the region's largest economies -
over common import duties for capital goods, telecommunications equipment
and computers had threatened to undermine Mercosur.
Argentina levies no duties on the import of these products, whereas Brazil
has always protected its high-tech manufacturers.
The two have met half-way, with Brazil accepting a lower tariff for these
goods and Argentina agreeing to abandon its zero tariff for capital and
high-tech goods.

Vietnam expects demand for oil products to outstrip supply by the time its

second refinery, agencies report from Hanoi.
US companies are submitting offers following the lifting of Washington's
economic embargo against Vietnam. A consortium led by Oklahoma-based Jopec
and Canada's Saint Martino has already made a proposal, the weekly Vietnam
Investment Review reported. A Houston-based company, Plant Processing
Equipment, would handle technical work, it added.
The bid was the first made public for the second refinery plan but stiff
competition is expected. Vietnam exports most of its crude oil to Japan and
Singapore and imports refined products.

Fokker, the aircraft manufacturer controlled by the Dasa unit of
Daimler-Benz, yesterday said it expected 3,500 aircraft with 40 to 125 seats
to be sold by the industry in the next 20 years, Reuter reports from
Amsterdam.
Its market outlook for the period 1993-2013 - little changed from a year ago
 -sees demand for 1,300 aircraft with 40 to 69 seats and 2,200 aircraft with
seating capacity of 70 to 125. The US and Europe will be the main markets
where 36 and 30 per cent of the new aircraft will be sold respectively. Half
of the demand for the smaller aircraft results from growth in air traffic,
the other half from replacement needs. Of the new 70-125 seaters, 25 per
cent will be sold to meet growth.
Demand for 70-125 seaters such as the Fokker 70 and the Fokker 100 fanjets
will peak at around 140 in 1997. After the year 2000 the market will
stabilise at an annual 100 aircraft.

FT  02 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Japan unmoved and immovable - A look at a
quiet confidence in the face of US sanctions threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The announcement by the US on Sunday that it was launching sanctions
proceedings against Japan has sent the yen on an upward course again, much
to the dismay of Japanese business, and added to the tension in relations
between the two countries.
Despite the threat of higher tariffs on selected Japanese goods implicit in
Washington's decision to call the Japanese government's procurement
practices discriminatory against foreign companies, the mood in Tokyo
yesterday was confident and composed.
'It is not a US-Japan trade war yet. We are far from a collapse in the
relationship,' one Japanese trade official said.
Japanese officials are less threatened by the possibility of sanctions, the
deadline for which decision is the end of September, than throughout most of
the history of US-Japanese trade tension when the danger of retaliatory
action by the US was usually enough to cow Japan into compliance.
They are well aware that despite the harsh words, the US has usually been
extremely cautious about resorting to sanctions and that even if they were
to be imposed, restricting government procurement of Japanese-made goods,
the impact on Japanese industry would not be devastating.
At the same time, the self-assurance that is evident among Japanese trade
negotiators reflects a conviction that on this issue at least, Japan not
only needs to, but can, stand up for what it believes is both right and
reasonable.
'What we are saying is reasonable and what they are saying is not,' says
one.
For one thing, Japanese officials are confident that their stance against US
demands for objective criteria has widespread public support, not only at
home but among influential academic and business circles in the west as
well.
The main difference that led to the breakdown of the talks over the weekend
centred on the issue of what objective criteria the two sides might adopt to
monitor progress in opening Japan's government procurement market to foreign
products.
The US has insisted that the two sides adopt certain benchmarks to measure
whether there has been progress in foreign penetration. This, it says, is
what was agreed in the framework agreement and cannot be compromised. 'The
framework language is the bottom line for us,' a US official said yesterday.
Japan, however, has been immovable in its determination to avoid agreeing to
any kind of measurement that could later be construed as a guarantee that
progress would be made.
Japanese officials fear that any further compromise on this issue would
create a dangerous precedent for the private sector issues, such as car and
car parts, that are still deadlocked by the same point of contention. And on
this point, they are confident that by resisting US calls for action that
could lead to managed trade, Japan is seen to bear the torch of free trade
not only at home but even among many of those who shape public opinion in
the US.
That conviction was given a strong boost in February, when failure to reach
agreement with the US on the framework talks led to a temporary suspension
in the negotiations that was greeted with turmoil on the currency markets.
'It was a psychological learning experience,' one Japanese official said.
'Japan had never rejected the US before,' and the firm stance it took
against the US at the time taught Japanese officials that it could be done.
Furthermore, Japanese officials insist that the changes it has proposed to
its government procurement system makes Japan one of the most transparent
markets in the world.
'Our feeling is that we do not understand why Japan should be named as
discriminating in government procurement when we have introduced clear and
transparent procedures that easily clears requirements under Gatt (General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) and makes Japan the most transparent country
after the US,' moaned one Japanese official.
The US claims Japan's government procurement procedures discriminate against
foreign suppliers by limiting access to early information on upcoming
procurements, relying on an informal network of domestic suppliers, not
giving sufficient consideration to the technical merits of a tender and, in
the telecom sector, developing technical specifications that favour domestic
suppliers.
In response, Japan has already offered to make early announcements of
procurement plans, consult suppliers before determining specifications and
lower the threshold of government contracts that will go to international
tender.
The Japanese say that if the US had studied these Japanese proposals well,
it would have seen that transparency in the Japanese market was being
promoted.
'Washington did not evaluate Japan's package to improve foreign access to
the government procurement market sufficiently,' Mr Hideaki Kumano, vice
minister for international trade and industry said yesterday.
But even more fundamentally, Japanese officials contest US claims that the
Japanese government procurement market is any more closed than markets in
other countries.
'We are not sure whether the statistics which the US use to claim that Japan
is closed are authentic,' one Japanese official noted. In the field of
medical equipment, for example, the US claims that US companies' share of
the EU market is 40 per cent. But if cross-border sales are included, as
they are according to Gatt calculations, the US share of the EU market is
16.4 per cent, which is not that much higher than the 15.4 per cent US share
of Japan's government procurement market of medical equipment.
What is more, Japanese purchases of US products in telecoms and medical
equipment is 10 times as much in value as US purchases of Japanese telecoms
and medical equipment, an official of the ministry of international trade
and industry says. If a trade surplus signifies closed markets, as the US
claims, the US surplus in this case must mean its government procurement
market is closed, he adds.
Japan believes that it has a strong card in its offer to lower the threshold
of procurement contracts much closer to US demands. But even this will not
be enough unless the two sides can get over their differences regarding
objective criteria which prevented discussion of all other issues at the
latest round of talks.
The US is crossing its fingers in the hope that as the deadline approaches,
Japanese officials will change their mind and adopt a more flexible stance
on criteria. The need for qualitative and quantitative measures of progress
was accepted by Japan at the time the framework agreement was signed.
'At some point the political commitment is going to filter down to the
bureaucracy,' says one US official.
But barring any second thoughts by a political leadership that is fully
occupied with shaping its own political identity and has left the trade
agenda largely in the hands of a trusted bureaucracy, there are few signs
that the Japanese stance will change.
'We have moved as much as we can. It all depends on the US,' a Japanese
official insists.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European Union steelmakers are to file an anti-dumping complaint, alleging
Czech and Hungarian structural steel suppliers have under-cut EU prices by
up to 50 per cent.
The east Europeans increased their EU market share almost threefold to 9 per
cent last year, and had captured 27 per cent of total German sales by the
final quarter, the Dusseldorf-based federal steel association said
yesterday.
Czech suppliers had been particularly aggressive, it added, raising their
share in Germany from an aver-age 5 per cent in the first nine months of
1993 to more than 18 per cent in the final quarter.
The complaint regarding structural steel, widely used in construction, will
be posted later this week by the EU's Eurofer industry group, which will
claim unfair tactics are costing western steel companies DM320m (Pounds
130m) a year.
According to German data, Czech manufacturers had an average 1.7 per cent
share of the EU market for structural steel in the first three quarters of
last year.
This climbed to 5.1 per cent in the final three months and had fallen to 4.6
per cent in the early part of the current year, association officials said
yesterday.
The Hungarians' share had gone from 1 per cent to 3.2 per cent and had
latterly eased to 3 per cent.
Latest figures showed Czech suppliers' share had slipped to 16.7 per cent in
Germany, while the Hungarians had maintained their stake at 9 per cent.
Meanwhile, the German association said further possible complaints were
under investigation.
Suspicions had been roused, for example, by data showing imports of finished
steel products from the Czech Republic had more than doubled in the first
quarter of this year.

FT  02 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Hard to crack high-tech Tokyo government
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign companies trying to sell high technology equipment to the Japanese
government can recount many trying experiences, such as the tale of GE
Yokogawa Medical, a US-Japanese joint venture company specialising in
high-tech medical equipment, Michiyo Nakamoto writes.
GE Yokogawa Medical says its biggest problem has been the low prices at
which Japanese government institutions must buy medical equipment.
Since the budget for procurement is very low, considering the high
technology that goes into the machines, it is impossible for a company like
GE Yokogawa to make profits on a deal. The company, which spends high sums
on research and development to develop its sophisticated medical equipment,
complains that the government does not know on what basis the budget is
actually determined.
GE Yokogawa contends that once the procurement price is set, Japanese
companies, which have not spent heavily on R&amp;D, are able to develop
equipment that meets the price requirement regardless of the quality of the
machines.
The company says that deals are often made on the basis of relationships
rather than on the merits of the equipment. 'We have been in this market for
over 10 years and have finally begun to develop relationships in the
sector,' a GE Yokogawa official said.
The official said notes a further Another barrier to business was that a
wide range of medical equipment, particularly new products that are commonly
sold in the US, cannot be imported into Japan simply because the Ministry of
Health and Welfare will not accept them as medical equipment: 'They must be
keeping them out of the country until Japanese companies develop similar
equipment.'

Argentina and Brazil have overcome the principal obstacle to the
implementation of Mercosur - the planned four-nation customs union that also
includes Paraguay and Uruguay - by reaching a compromise on the trade pact's
future common external tariffs.
Economy and foreign ministers from Argentina and Brazil, meeting near Buenos
Aires at the weekend, drew up a detailed pact on the customs union planned
to come into force on January 1 next year.
The presidents of the four countries will meet in Buenos Aires on Friday for
a summit at which they are expected to approve the compromise.
A dispute between Argentina and Brazil - the region's largest economies -
over common import duties for capital goods, telecommunications equipment
and computers had threatened to undermine Mercosur.
Argentina levies no duties on the import of these products, whereas Brazil
has always protected its local high-tech manufacturers.
The two have met half-way, with Brazil accepting a lower tariff for these
goods and Argentina agreeing to abandon its zero tariff for capital and
high-tech goods.
Argentine and Brazilian negotiators have also agreed on a detailed list of
products which will receive special protection after January. They account
for about 15 per cent of bilateral trade. These privileges will be gradually
reduced over the coming years and will end in 2005.
In addition, Brazil and Argentina also agreed on special treatment for their
free trade zones in Manaus and Tierra del Fuego.
These zones - which import components free of duty, assemble them and
'export' the finished goods to their domestic markets - will be allowed to
continue operating after 1995, paying the applicable Mercosur tariff when
goods are exported to another member country.

FT  02 AUG 94 / US approaches healthcare prescription: The final legislative
stages of the Clinton search for health insurance for all
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle for reform of the US healthcare system will reach its height this
week as Congress and the public get a full sight of the two principal
alternative bills on offer.
Today Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader, will unveil his version
of healthcare reform for consideration next week by the Senate. It is likely
to be significantly different from the bill proposed last Friday by the
Democratic leadership in the House which will also go to the floor next
week.
President Bill Clinton has already pretty much cleared his schedule to focus
on the issue. Yesterday he was campaigning in New Jersey and tomorrow he
will greet the first of the bus caravans of reform supporters arriving in
Washington from all corners of the country to lobby Congress.
The president's weekend line during campaigning in President Harry Truman's
old home town of Independence, Missouri, was to urge Americans not to shirk
the challenge of healthcare reform and to praise the House blueprint, which
is not dissimilar to his own even though it is now being touted by its
sponsors as 'not the Clinton bill'.
Mr Mitchell, who conferred with the president yesterday morning, has already
given some clues to his thinking, both in television interviews and in
presentations to pro-reform lobbyists. He said he had urged representatives
of organised labour and the elderly that 'they should not let the perfect
become the enemy of the very good'.
As an inducement, he will propose that both prescription drug coverage and
long-term home care for the elderly be included in any legislation. The
Senate labour committee has endorsed this approach but its finance committee
has not.
But Mr Mitchell's bill will not compel employers to pay a substantial
portion of the insurance premiums of their workforces before the year 2002,
and only then if a combination of subsidies to small companies and changes
to insurance laws have not raised to 95 per cent the number of Americans
with insurance coverage. Even then he envisages only a 50 per cent 'mandate'
on employers.
The House bill, sponsored by Mr Richard Gephardt, the majority leader, and
very much along the lines of the measure already approved by its ways and
means committee, would require employers to foot 80 per cent of the cost to
achieve universal coverage by 1999. The president's plan also proposed 80
per cent mandates, to take effect by 1998.
Extensive subsidies to small companies to offset the cost are proposed. The
national Medicare programme would be extended to cover the unemployed and
part-time workers and those who cannot obtain workplace coverage, while
changes to insurance laws would make it much harder to deny protection to
those with long-term pre-existing medical conditions.
The real problem for both Mr Mitchell and Mr Gephardt is that each chamber
is going to be looking across the Capitol building at the other, with the
House especially nervous that it might end up passing a bill which, mostly
because of the employer mandates and the extension of Medicare, will be
unacceptable to the Senate.
That assumes, as is often the case because of its tighter procedural rules,
that the House comes to a vote first. But, with both debating
simultaneously, this usual order cannot be guaranteed.
No Republicans are expected to support the House bill, though Mr Mitchell's
less ambitious plan could conceivably win the odd vote from the other side
of the aisle in the Senate. Congressman Barney Frank, the Massachusetts
Democrat, predicted passage in the House 'because we have more Democrats and
fewer neurotics'.
Broadly speaking, the medical and insurance industries and most of big
business (except the car companies) are dead set against the House bill and
suspicious of Mr Mitchell's, though it may come to be seen as the lesser of
two evils.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Altman 'will not resign' over Whitewater briefing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Roger Altman, deputy secretary of the Treasury, denied yesterday he was
thinking of resigning over briefings he gave the White House on the status
of regulatory investigations into the bankrupt savings and loan company
implicated in the Whitewater affair. Asked in a morning television interview
if he might be made the 'fall guy,' he replied: 'I know a lot of people
think I am going to be, but I don't think so.'
Mr Altman is due to appear today before the Senate banking committee holding
hearings on the Whitewater affair, which has its origins in the Clinton
family's financial and land dealings in Arkansas in the 1970s and 1980s.
Senator Al D'Amato, the New York Republican, said on Friday he had
information that Mr Altman's briefings on the possibility of criminal
charges in the case of the Madison Guaranty savings and loan went into
detail beyond that previously disclosed.
But Mr Altman countered yesterday that he had been cleared twice of any
criminal and ethical wrongdoing by Mr Robert Fiske, the independent counsel
on Whitewater, and, on Sunday, by the office of government ethics, a
non-partisan federal agency.
The office did say that some contacts between treasury and the White House,
while not unethical, were 'troubling'. Mr Altman conceded yesterday, as
other administration officials had last week, that 'poor judgments' were
made.
Mr Altman also denied he had misled Congress last February, as Mr D'Amato
has alleged. He had corrected the record of his testimony because he did not
know at the time of two meetings last autumn. 'I've always thought that
amending the record was something constructive to do, not a bad thing to
do,' he said.
The banking committee was also due later yesterday to hear from Ms Jean
Hanson, the Treasury's legal counsel, whose recollections of various
meetings she attended appear to be at odds with those of Mr Altman and Mr
Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary.
In the morning, officials from the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency
established to handle the savings and loan bankruptcies of the 1980s,
testified that no one in the Clinton administration had tried to influence
their investigations into Madison Guaranty. This was owned by Mr James
McDougal, partner of the Clintons in the Whitewater land investment.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Argentina braced for general strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Argentina's opposition parties and breakaway trade unions say they will
bring the country to a halt today with a general strike to protest against
the free-market policies of President Carlos Menem.
The strike follows a march by the same groups three weeks ago that brought
100,000 protesters to Buenos Aires in one of the largest anti-government
demonstrations since Mr Menem took office in 1989.
Mr Menem attacked the strike call as 'capricious' and declared it illegal.
Mr Domingo Cavallo, the economy minister, predicted the strike would be a
'failure'. He added: 'It is political. It is clearly illegal.' Mr Armando
Caro Figueroa, labour minister, warned that declaring the strike illegal
would allow employers to sack striking workers.
Previous general strikes against Mr Menem's Peronist government by the
Peronist-dominated CGT union confederation have been half-hearted and have
always failed. Mr Menem has skilfully co-opted union leaders while
restricting union rights first granted by the movement's founder, Juan
Peron, when president in the late-1940s and mid-1970s.
However, pressure is coming from public-sector unions that quit the CGT and
from younger industrial union leaders who feel unrepresented by the Peronist
old guard. They are allied to the Frente Grande, a rising opposition party
comprising disaffected Peronists and leftists, which is prominent in
organising the strike.
The strike call follows the government's announcement last week of a sharp
rise in unemployment. Unemployment, measured twice a year, rose to a record
10.8 per cent in May from 9.9 per cent in October last year.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Congress ponders change in foreign company tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEREMY KAHN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Congress, desperate for funds to cover everything from healthcare
reform to lost tariff revenue from trade treaties, is considering big
changes in the way foreign corporations are taxed.
The Foreign Tax Compliance Act of 1994, introduced on Friday by a group of
legislators that included Mr Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader,
would drop the current arms-length accounting method when calculating the
income of foreign-controlled companies. Under the arms-length principle,
embraced in all international tax treaties, only income earned in a
particular country or state is taxed by that government.
The bill proposes instead the use of an accounting method similar to
California's worldwide unitary tax system, which the UK's Barclays Bank and
Colgate-Palmolive of the US challenged unsuccessfully in US courts. Under
the unitary method a company's tax is calculated by multiplying its
worldwide income by a factor based on the proportion of its operations in a
particular country or state.
Mr Gephardt asserted that almost 75 per cent of foreign-controlled
corporations avoided paying any US taxes under the current accounting
system. He said it was time they 'pay their fair share'.
The bill would also end the tax deferral on profits stemming from the
overseas operations of US companies, in an attempt to discourage US
corporations from moving manufacturing jobs abroad.
The lawmakers introducing the act said the tax changes could raise more than
Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.4bn) and would help President Bill Clinton make good
on a campaign pledge to remove incentives for US companies to cut domestic
jobs.
'Everyone's looking for money,' said Mr Byron Dorgan, a Democratic senator
from North Dakota. 'There's a source of money out there that's obvious.'
Mr Dorgan added that the act could be tacked on to appropriations bills for
healthcare reform or for the implementation of the Uruguay Round of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, increasing the likelihood that the
tax legislation might pass.
Mr Willard Berry, president of the European-American Chamber of Commerce,
said he would lobby hard against the tax act. 'This might be more of a
serious effort' than previous attempts to soak multinational corporations,
he said.

<TEXT>
Haiti's de facto government declared a state of siege early yesterday, hours
after the United Nations voted to approve a US resolution allowing the use
of force to remove its military leaders, Reuter reports from Port-au-Prince
and Washington.
In a decree read over state-run television and radio, provisional President
Emile Jonassaint called the UN vote 'arbitrary, iniquitous and in violation
of international rights'.
He gave no details of what the state of siege entailed but reiterated Haiti
was ready to fight against any foreign intervention.
The UN Security Council had voted 12-0 to approve a resolution allowing the
US to invade Haiti, should it choose, to remove the military leaders who
took power in a bloody September 1991 coup. President Bill Clinton has
refused to rule out military action to oust the coup leaders but US
officials have repeatedly said an invasion is not 'imminent'.
Ms Madeleine Albright, US ambassador to the UN, said yesterday that despite
the UN action an invasion of Haiti was not the only option to force out
Haiti's military rulers. She said the military rulers could leave
'voluntarily and soon or involuntarily and soon', but would not define
'soon'.
Radio stations said that under the declaration all civil power was
transferred to the military. Meetings could be dispersed, media outlets
could be closed, searches could be carried out without warrants and a curfew
could be imposed.

US purchasing managers reported a further increase in business activity in
July, but warned that rising materials prices continue to be a concern.
The National Association of Purchasing Managers said yesterday that its
monthly index of business activity rose slightly to 57.8 per cent in July,
its highest level for six years.
Buyers questioned by the association reported that production and new orders
continued to grow, and that their order backlogs were still lengthening.
Mr Ralph Kauffman, manager of procurement at Oryx Energy and chairman of the
NAPM's survey committee, said the index had averaged 57.4 in the first seven
months of 1994.
Past experience indicates that if this average were sustained for all of
1994, real gross domestic growth should exceed 4 per cent, Mr Kauffman said.
Most stock market economists had been predicting a modest drop in the
purchasing managers' index, which is one of the earliest indicators of
economic activity in July. The federal government is due to publish its own
forecasting gauge, the index of leading economic indicators for June,
tomorrow.
Although the NAPM price index dropped slightly to 73.1, compared with 73.5
in June, reports of higher prices for raw materials spread more widely
across different industrial sectors. Only the food industry reported
generally lower prices.
Among the purchasing executives questioned, 50 per cent reported they had to
pay higher prices in July, while 44 per cent said prices remained the same.
Only 6 per cent reported lower prices, mostly in agricultural products such
as beef, pork, orange juice, corn, corn syrup and soyabean oil.
The Commerce Department, meanwhile, reported that personal income rose by
0.1 per cent in June, after seasonal adjustments, a slower rate of increase
than in May or than predicted by most financial market economists.
Construction spending, Commerce said, rose by 0.2 per cent in June, also a
smaller rise than expected.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Italian birth rate shrinks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italians risk becoming a vanishing race if current demographic trends
continue. In 1993 Italy registered a 'birth deficit', with deaths
outnumbering the newly born for the first time this century outside the
first world war. According to Istat, the national statistics institute, the
number of births fell to 538,168 - the lowest level since the unification of
Italy. In contrast, the number of deaths rose to 543,433. Compared to 1992,
the birth rate fell from 9.9 to 9.4 per 1,000. If the present trend
continues, one recent research paper suggests Italy's population could fall
from 57m to 12m by the year 2100. However, the south continues to be
prolific and its baby 'surplus' almost compensates for the 'deficit' in the
centre and north. Increased wealth is the main explanation for the decline.
But unlike northern European countries, Italy does not possess an immigrant
population with a high birth rate.

Spain has imposed a Pta15m (Pounds 76,000) fine on a former Bank of Spain
director for insider trading. The economy ministry said in a statement
yesterday that it had ratified a recommendation by the National Securities
Market Commission, fining Mr Tomas Ramon Fernandez Rodriguez for insider
trading in Banco Espanol de Credito-Banesto shares. Mr Fernandez ordered the
sale of 2,388 Banesto shares on December 23 1993, the same day the Bank of
Spain's executive committee met in his presence to analyse emergency
measures to be taken at Banesto, whose board the central bank ousted on
December 28. The shares were actually sold on December 27, which the
ministry said saved him Pta3.06m. The next day Banesto's shares were
suspended when they were quoting at 1,995. They resumed trade at the end of
January at 855.

<TEXT>
East Germans work longer hours and take fewer holidays than west Germans, as
shown by figures of per capita working time among the workforce, according
to a report published by the Halle Institute for Economic Research. The
Institute, one of the six economic think-tanks which advises the federal
government, also believes the fall in the unemployment rate in eastern
Germany has stopped and patterns of employment in the region will eventually
converge with western Germany. Mr Hilmar Schneider, author of the report,
expects unemployment in eastern Germany to stabilise at around 15.8 per
cent. However, contrary to previous estimates that unofficial unemployment,
including those on on job creation schemes, short-time work, or those who
have taken early retirement, make up an additional 25 per cent of the labour
force, the Halle Institute puts the figure as low as 12 per cent. It
concludes that the total unemployment figure in eastern Germany is 28 per
cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of construction equipment in Europe will rise by 2 per cent this year
to more than 90,000 units, and climb a further 6 per cent next year,
according to a forecast to be published by London-based analysts Corporate
Intelligence Group. The forecast is significantly more optimistic than its
prediction in the spring, when it thought sales would fall by 5 per cent
this year before recovering by 7 per cent in 1995. The better outlook is
partly due to a slower than expected decline in the biggest market, Germany,
where the post-reunification boom in sales has ended. A 9 per cent decline
in the German market is foreseen this year, compared with the 15 per cent
predicted in the spring. The German market is likely to account for 41 per
cent of total European sales this year. Elsewhere the group says some 'major
changes' are taking place: the UK is enjoying very strong growth, Spain and
France are recovering well, and Scandinavia is showing signs of returning to
life. The overall sales forecast this year, 90,121 units, is still 10 per
cent down on the level of 1991, and 16 per cent down on the peak of demand
in 1989-1990.

European Union steelmakers are to file an anti-dumping complaint, alleging
Czech and Hungarian structural steel suppliers have under-cut EU prices by
up to 50 per cent. The east Europeans increased their EU market share almost
threefold to 9 per cent last year, and had captured 27 per cent of total
German sales by the final quarter, the Dusseldorf-based federal steel
association said yesterday. Czech suppliers had been particularly
aggressive, it added, raising their share in Germany from an average 5 per
cent in the first nine months of 1993 to more than 18 per cent in the final
quarter. The complaint regarding structural steel, widely used in
construction, will be posted later this week by the EU's Eurofer industry
group, which will claim unfair tactics are costing western steel companies
DM320m (Pounds 130m) a year.

The French ministry of culture said yesterday it would ask parliament in the
autumn to pass legislation to take account of the objections of the French
constitutional court to the law protecting the French language. Mr Jacques
Toubon, the culture minister who has championed the cause of linguistic
protection, insisted yesterday in an interview in the daily Le Figaro that
the court's ruling over the weekend was 'globally positive' because it
recognised the government's right to impose French in certain areas of
public life. But the constitutional court, he complained, threatened to make
his law even more restrictive by giving it to judges to interpret without
the help of an official glossary of French terms. The law, commonly known as
the Loi Toubon, stipulated that foreign phrases could be accepted only if
they had no French equivalent in this glossary. The court said codifying the
language of private citizens in such a glossary infringed their freedom of
expression. The culture ministry says it will clarify that the law applies
only to public officials.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Russian inflation on the rise again
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russian inflation, which was squeezed to under 5 per cent a month in June,
hit 6 per cent in July and is set to rise this month and next to reach 10
per cent in September, according to Mr Alexander Livshits, the economic
adviser to President Boris Yeltsin, writes John Lloyd in Moscow.
Mr Livshits said the central bank had issued or would have to issue at least
Rbs6,000bn in credits shortly to cover the expenses of the harvest and to
provision the northern cities in the Arctic Circle for the winter.
However, he expected the inflation rate to fall again at the end of the
year. He said it should now be possible to bring the rate down to around 2
per cent a month in 1995, with a peak in the autumn of 6 per cent.
The relatively low inflation rate allowed the central bank to again lower
its three-month refinancing rate yesterday from 155 per cent annually to 150
per cent - the sixth reduction since April.
The refinancing rate has gone down with inflation from a peak of 210 per
cent, though it has yet to stimulate much lending. Most Russian banks prefer
to make money by acting as a depositor, by arbitrage and by offering other
financial services, than by risking their capital in industry.

<TEXT>
Germany's foreign trade surplus in 1993 was almost double that of the
previous year, according to revised figures released yesterday by the
federal statistics office. The trade surplus was DM61bn (Pounds 25.2bn) in
1993, compared to DM33bn in 1992. Exports have been revised upwards by
DM24.6bn to DM628.5bn, while imports have been increased by DM22.7bn to
DM567.6bn. The surplus of foreign trade has been revised upwards by DM1.8bn.
The improved trade surplus will have a positive impact on the balance of
payments deficit, which since 1991 has exceeded DM30bn each year. The
balance of payments deficit last year totalled DM35.3bn, a rise of DM0.8bn
on the previous year.
Italian retail sales rose 7.7 per cent in the first quarter of 1994 from a
year ago, according to Istat, the state statistics office. In the quarter,
Istat's index of retail sales registered 105.3 compared with 97.7 in the
same period of 1993. The rise in January to March 1994 followed an increase
of 5.8 per cent year on year in the fourth quarter of 1993.
Dutch consumer spending rose 1.7 per cent in volume terms in April compared
with the same month of 1993, the Central Bureau of Statistics said.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Market pioneers fear MMM fall-out: Securities firms warn of
over-regulation in Russian market after pyramid hysteria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bankers and dealers nursing Russia's fledgling securities market fear the
scandal engulfing the finance house MMM will persuade the government to
overregulate the market.
It was not lack of market regulation, they say, but the elementary nature of
the regulation that was partly responsible for the threatened collapse of a
company in which millions have invested their savings.
Mr Maxim Boyko, chairman of Russia's privatisation agency, said yesterday
the government had learnt its lesson. 'From now on, it'll intervene in
similar schemes. People will be cautious and think twice before investing
their money.' He called for a ban on dozens of similar shady schemes which
have lured investors.
Russian officials have asked the MMM chairman, Mr Sergei Mavrodi, to a
meeting tomorrow to try to sort out legal tangles surrounding the firm's
troubles. He is to face officials from the finance ministry and the state
anti-monopoly committee, according to Itar-Tass news agency. Officials also
want MMM to register its shareholders and audit its activities 'to give the
public a better idea of what is going on with the company', Tass said.
MMM, which still refuses to announce its own death, op-ened some of its
Moscow kiosks yesterday - but was only selling, not buying, shares at
Rbs1,125. The crowd around the headquarters in suburban Moscow thinned -
possibly due to the organisation of a union of MMM shareholders whose
chairman, Mr Vladimir Poluektov, said branches were being set up 'at
lightning speed'.
Negotiations began between the union and company for repayment of those in
most need, such as invalids and pensioners: the company has promised to
refund them at the shares' high of Rbs115,000. Of 11 such applications
processed yesterday, one asked for assistance to bury a man whose relatives
had invested all their savings in MMM.
Though little else has been the subject of conversation for the past 10
days, and the cabinet devoted a full meeting last Thursday to discussing it,
MMM and similar miracle share schemes continue to operate and advertise.
MMM was not the first in the market: companies named Tibet and Chara were
offering huge mark-ups on their shares before it appeared, and a company
named TeleMarket has aggressively entered the market in recent months. All
appear to operate in the same manner: with registered offices in a (usually
deserted) private flat, they offer shares which are essentially coupons with
a face value redeemable at any time at the value currently quoted by the
company.
MMM is thought to be a classic pyramid operation: where money deposited by
the many buying into the company's success funds the higher prices paid to
the fewer cashing in their shares - a process that can continue until the
influx of investors dries up or, as in the case of MMM, investors'
confidence is shaken and a run on the company begins.
The longer term consequences of the crash in the value of the shares last
week - from Rbs115,000 to Rbs1,000 - is not thought to have greatly affected
the behaviour of the larger Russian or foreign investors playing the
increasingly active Russian stock markets.
'People in the finance community have not really been talking about this as
a worry, but as a source of amusement,' said Anatoly Danilitsky, a Moscow
financial consultant yesterday. 'It's having very little effect on
business'.
'No one I talk to would admit to buying MMM shares,' said another
consultant. 'The kind of people who bought them are not those who are buying
and selling through our company.'
The concern, however, is elsewhere. It is fear of the reaction of a
government acutely conscious some people blame it for the crash - indeed, Mr
Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, has already admitted the government
was at fault - and concerned to so tighten the rules in the securities
market as to choke the life out of it before it can stand.
'There's good and bad in this,' said Mr Stephen Jennings of the CSFB group.
'You need regulation of the market but there's regulation which can
encourage and that which can harm. You can get licensing requirements which
keep out the fly-by-nights - but also it can be so framed as to keep out the
new enterprises which are going to grow.'
What larger Russian and foreign finance companies want to encourage is
emergence of a so far elusive 'structural investor' - an individual or group
that would take an engineering company making missiles or tanks and convert
it to turning out cheap, state of the art consumer goods. 'I haven't seen
these yet,' said the Russian consultant, 'though there is plenty of activity
in the market.'
Mr Andrew Balgarnie of Morgan Stanley said: 'If the banks will not act as
they should by getting the funds to the businesses, then the only route is
via share offerings. That's why this market is so important, and why it's so
important to regulate it properly'.
All companies now working in the securities markets, awash with shares
because of the speed of privatisation, report growing activity by domestic
and foreign investors in a steadily rising market. 'There's more money
available from foreigners than there are profitable or adequate mechanisms
to receive it,' said Mr Balgarnie.
Financial experts see MMM as one of the rogue companies typical of the early
stages of a money market - Russian commentators have likened it to the 18th
century South Sea Bubble and the 19th century Panama Canal Scheme - and not
as a bellwether for Russian capitalism as a whole.

A committee of members of Britain's upper house yesterday called on the
European Union to revise plans for common visa laws, saying they could end
the right of many Commonwealth citizens to travel freely to Britain. The
European Communities committee of the House of Lords said in a report that a
proposed list of countries whose nationals would require visas to enter the
EU was unnecessarily long and would damage British interests. The list,
drawn up by the European Commission, includes countries in the Commonwealth
whose citizens do not currently require visas for short visits to Britain.
The committee also said it believes that the Community has no power to
require mutual recognition of visas by member states or to draw up a list of
countries whose nationals should not require visas.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Bosnian Serbs hint at offer over territory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND and Agencies
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bosnian Serbs said yesterday they wanted to reopen talks with western powers
and Russia on a Bosnian peace plan. Willingness to make at least heavily
qualified concessions was further demonstrated by Mr Radovan Karadzic, the
Bosnian Serb leader, who indicated for the first time that he might accept
the division of Bosnian territory laid out in the peace proposal.
The Serb offer to negotiate is the latest move in a protracted haggle which
intensified on Friday when the self-styled Bosnia Serb parliament refused to
accept the peace plan brokered by an international 'contact group'
comprising the US, Russia, Britain, France and Germany.
The contact group responded on Saturday by calling for tighter sanctions but
the five foreign ministers failed to evoke the measure most feared by the
Serbs - lifting the Bosnian arms embargo. Such a move, which would
strengthen the Moslems, enjoys wide US political support.
France yesterday rejected new negotiations, saying the 'proposal contains no
new element. . . .' The US called the idea a 'non-starter' and Mr Andrei
Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, said in Belgrade he would no longer talk
to Mr Karadzic. 'We cannot be a toy in the hands of the party of war,' he
said. Britain and Germany also rejected more talks.
Mr Bosnian Serb leader signalled a more conciliatory attitude in an
interview due to be published today in the Russian daily Sevodnya. He said
Serbs might accept the division of Bosnian territory outlined in the contact
group plan which gives the Moslem-Croat federation 51 per cent of the land
and the Serbs 49 per cent. 'But the territory we are given must not be a
patchwork,' he said.
Mr Karadzic, whose forces control some 70 per cent of Bosnia, also sought to
further divide the already fragile consensus within the contact group, where
Russia has consistently taken a more placatory stance toward their historic
allies, the Serbs.
'Russia must understand how dangerous Nato's games are not only for Serbia
but for Russia as well,' he said, after praising last week's personal
intervention in the peace process by President Boris Yeltsin. 'Nato is
trying in all ways to diminish Russian influence in the Balkans.'

The campaign for next month's Swedish general election moved up a gear
yesterday as Mr Carl Bildt, the prime minister, issued a spirited defence of
his coalition government's record, saying its market reform policies had to
continue if Sweden was to achieve 'stable and high' growth rates for the
rest of the decade.
The four government parties, led by Mr Bildt's conservative Moderate party,
trail the opposition Social Democrats in the opinion polls and are
handicapped by record unemployment, a record budget deficit and the
fastest-growing public debt in the developed world that together have
cramped growth forecasts. But Mr Bildt, presenting a 100-page summary of the
right-centre coalition's three-year term in office, insisted the government
had paved the way for a return to economic growth after three years of
recession.
'All the curves that pointed the wrong way in the autumn of 1991 now point
in the right direction again,' he declared. 'Exports are growing, so is
industrial production. Unemployment is going down again, as is the deficit
in the state finances. Inflation is low and productivity has increased
strongly in both industry and the public sector.'
Mr Bildt's presentation followed a sharp attack on the Social Democrats at
the weekend and signalled the start of what is set to be a bitter campaign.
The Social Democrats responded by saying Sweden had its worst unemployment
(currently about 14 per cent of the workforce) since the 1930s. 'We have a
prime minister who has totally lost contact with the reality of ordinary
people,' said Ms Mona Sahlin, their party secretary.
The prime minister acknowledged that the budget deficit, which reached 13
per cent of gross domestic product in the last budget year, and the growing
borrowing requirement, represented the greatest threat to recovery. But he
said the coalition parties were committed to strengthening savings
programmes, while continuing policies of deregulation, privatisation and
reforming the welfare state.
The Social Democrats are due to unveil their detailed economic programme on
August 19. So far their main emphasis has been on raising some corporate and
high-band income taxes and strengthening industrial investment.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Largest fall for years in French jobless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
French unemployment recorded its biggest fall for four years in June,
declining by 13,000 to 3.33m, or 12.6 per cent of the workforce, the labour
ministry said yesterday.
The figures support official claims that the underlying unemployment trend
is stabilising and should start to decline towards the end of the year.
They will provide encouragement for the centre-right government of Mr
Edouard Balladur, which has targeted France's acute unemployment problem as
a priority before the presidential elections which are due to be held next
spring.
Officials and private sector economists, however, expressed caution about
the statistics.
A statement from Mr Balladur's office said that the figures were a sign that
unemployment was under greater control. But it said there was still a lot to
do in tackling the problem.
The French unemployment rate, although down from the record 12.7 per cent
reached in May, remains the highest among the Group of Seven industrialised
nations.
Most private sector economists forecast a volatile pattern of unemployment
statistics over the next few months, as school-leavers enter the jobs market
and as the economy continues along an uneven recovery path. 'The worst may
be over, but there will probably be a bumpy patch until we see signs of a
clear downward trend,' said one economist at a Paris-based merchant bank.
Ms Esther Baroudy, senior economist at Credit Lyonnais, said that some of
the improvement in June reflected the number struck off the registers at
employment agencies following their failure to respond to surveys. She said
that the fragile nature of France's economic recovery could also limit
employment growth.
The labour ministry figures showed particular improvement in youth
unemployment. In the first half of 1994, the number of unemployed between
the ages of 16 and 25 fell by 18,900, compared with a rise of 24,200 in the
same period last year.
The problem of long-term unemployed, however, has continued to deteriorate.
The number of those out of work for more than one year reached 1.16m in the
first half.
Industry leaders have expressed concern about the structural nature of
France's unemployment problem. Mr Jean Gandois, former head of the metals
and packaging group Pechiney, and a candidate for the chairmanship of the
Patronat, France's employers' association, said at the weekend that social
charges and employment costs facing business needed to be reduced. 'Growth
can help. But it cannot resolve the problem of unemployment,' he said.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Berlusconi prepared to change Fininvest plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, is willing to consider
changes in the proposals he has made on avoiding a conflict of interest with
his Fininvest business empire.
Hints of flexibility came as he prepared for today's important debate in
parliament on recent incidents when his business interests have clashed with
those of his role as prime minister.
The debate is not a formal vote of confidence, but Mr Berlusconi is expected
to use the occasion to try to recoup some of his battered prestige before
the parliamentary summer break at the end of the week. It will also be an
important test of the unity of the right-wing coalition government.
Mr Berlusconi's proposals for avoiding a conflict of interest were unveiled
on Friday and were based on advice from three lawyers who had originally
been asked to report by the end of September.
However, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro has already ensured that part of the
plan will have to be rewritten. He said that the president could not be
asked to help nominate a five-person commission to monitor any conflict of
interest, as suggested by Mr Berlusconi. That was outside the president's
constitutional authority, he said.
Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the populist Northern League, a coalition
partner, has promised to introduce new proposals during the debate. The
League leader, who has been a constant thorn in Mr Berlusconi's side, says
he is determined to prevent the prime minister having any influence over the
management of Fininvest, Italy's second largest private company.
Mr Berlusconi has let it be known that his own proposals can be
reconsidered. But he is adamant about retaining ownership of Fininvest,
albeit at a distance. Mr Bossi said over the weekend that ownership should
be placed in a foundation, but did not elaborate.
The former communist Party of the Democratic Left has said in the past that
the problems can only be solved by Mr Berlusconi selling Fininvest. But most
now recognise this is easier said than done.
Any proposal will have to pass through parliament as a law, with discussion
beginning in September. The League has the power to undermine the
legislation, and Mr Bossi's partners in the right-wing coalition were
nervous yesterday that he might threaten sabotage or an alliance with the
opposition. However, Mr Bossi was thought likely to want to keep Mr
Berlusconi guessing.
Also influencing today's debate will be the nomination of a new chairman for
Italy's anti-trust authority, following the death at the weekend of Mr
Francesco Saja, a former head of the constitutional court. Mr Saja had
played a significant role in trying to introduce the concept of anti-trust
rules to cartel-ridden Italy.
The nomination is controlled by the speakers of both houses of parliament,
who have also been proposed to nominate Mr Berlusconi's conflict of interest
commission.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Business tries to shift blame in latest bribes inquiry: Who
is corrupting whom is a crucial issue in the case involving the country's
financial police
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Throughout Italy's corruption scandals businessmen have consistently painted
themselves as victims of the system. They were not the corruptors, but the
corrupted. The corruptors were venal civil servants and politicians.
This defence is being raised again now as Milan magistrates investigate
businessmen in northern Italy for paying bribes to members of the Guardia di
Finanza, the financial police, to carry out 'friendly' tax assessments and
inspections.
The question of who is doing the corrupting is especially important in this
case since it involves a central pillar of the state - the 61,000-strong
corps charged with monitoring all financial crime.
In the past three weeks, almost 40 businessmen and accountants, and a
similar number of the financial police, have been arrested as part of the
Milan investigation. Over the weekend, magistrates in Genoa opened a new
front, arresting 19 people, including three members of the Guardia di
Finanza.
First it was the case of Mr Alberto Falck, the prominent private steel
producer, who admitted paying L500m (Pounds 205,000) to the Guardia di
Finanza. 'There was a system which had to be honoured,' Mr Falck's lawyer
was quoted as saying.
Then, last week, it was the turn of Mr Paolo Berlusconi, younger brother of
prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. He admitted paying out L330m over the
inspections of three different companies in the Fininvest group. According
to his lawyer, the payments were made under duress.
Talking to several businessmen, it emerges that payments to members of the
Guardia di Finanza to carry out low key inspections or overlook
irregularities in company balance sheets are not uncommon. The practice
appears more widespread in northern Italy, and Milan magistrates have
uncovered a well-structured system of payments, with bribes being cut on a
percentage basis by rank.
However, the same businessmen also admit that the process is by no means all
one-sided. The payments are often volunteered in what is a mutually
beneficial arrangement to both entrepreneur and policeman.
'I don't think we even thought it was a bribe: it was like a glorified form
of tipping,' observered one Rome businessman.
'These sort of practices are the natural result of a tax system based on
rigid laws and inflexible tax demands, which only become flexible through
evasion.'
Gen Constantino Berlenghi, the head of the Guardia di Finanza, last week
ridiculed the idea of big business being coerced into paying bribes to his
men.
'How is it that a big businessman who has access to tax lawyers, professors
and other luminaries can make one believe he is being intimidated by a
little marshal of the force? It's inconceivable]'
Whoever is to blame, it cannot hide the fact that members of the Guardia di
Finanza were willing to pocket sums of money, which, by the standards of
their pay packets, were very large.
A case came to light in Genoa earlier this year of 11 Guardia members taking
L300m from a large construction company. The average pay, excluding fringe
benefits, of the top four grades of officer in the force is L115m a year. A
marshal receives L52m a year.
More alarming was the arrest over the weekend of a colonel who had been
working closely with Mr Antonio Di Pietro, the leading anti-corruption
magistrate in Milan, throughout the past two and half years of corruption
investigations. He was accused of having received L150m from Mr Antonio
Ligresti, brother of the construction magnate Mr Salvatore Ligresti, known
as the 'king of Milan concrete', for inspection of a hotel company's books
in 1990.
At the same time another person arrested last week in the investigations
into Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest empire was Mr Gian Marco Rizzi, a
former member of the Guardia di Finanza who was recruited in the early 1980s
to become a consultant to the prime minister's media group.
Given the spate of Guardia di Finanza arrests, the Italian press has begun
to wonder whether there are more than just a few 'rotten apples' in the
corps, popularly known as the Yellow Flame because of its insignia.
Gen Luigi Ramponi, a former commander of the Guardia di Finanza, was asked
by Il Mondo weekly magazine just how many were corrupt. 'After the scandal,
everyone thinks dishonesty is widespread; but I am sure the majority are
honest. . . . the present cases are isolated. Numerous but isolated. Similar
incidents have always happened because the temptations exist. . . .'
He went on to point out that the present Milan investigation was the product
of an internal inquiry which was handed over to the magistrates. The high
degree of honour within the force, some officers claim, has led to three
people implicated committing suicide in the past month.
With the spotlight on the Yellow Flame, opposition politicians have begun to
press for a demilitarisation of the Guardia. Mr Giulio Tremonti, the finance
minister, who is directly responsible for these police, has ruled this out.
Within the force itself, any move towards demilitarisation is likely to be
resisted.

FT  02 AUG 94 / China flies in the face of satellite parking convention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China has become the first country to flout the conventions of space by
parking a satellite in a position that could interfere with other satellites
and hinder the Asian ambitions of international broadcasting companies.
There are no laws governing the launch and positioning of satellites above
the earth. But it has become a convention that agreement with the owners of
adjacent satellites is reached through the International Telecommunication
Union (ITU), a Geneva-based United Nations agency that registers satellites.
Industry executives said the Chinese launch of a commercial satellite 12
days ago was the first time that a country has launched a satellite without
the agreement of other operators of satellites near the intended position of
the new satellite.
They believe that if the satellite is used as planned in coming weeks it
will interfere with signals from a planned Japanese telecommunications
satellite and a satellite operated by Rimsat, a US company, to beam
television to India. They also say that some of the Chinese satellite's 24
transponders, or transmitters, may be inoperable because of interference
caused by its proximity to the other satellites.
In this case, the business strategies of some of the US's top broadcasters
could be badly affected. Turner Broadcasting, Home Box Office, and Viacom,
which owns MTV, have all signed up to use the satellite to further their
ambitions in Asian broadcasting.
In addition, the China Telecommunications Broadcasting Satellite Corporation
has signed a lease agreement for eight of the satellite's transponders for
both television and telecommunications.
The Japanese government is believed to be angry about the Chinese
government's behaviour. It had talks in Beijing last week which ended in
failure.
The state-of-the-art Chinese satellite, is owned by APT Satellite, a Hong
Kong-registered company controlled by three Chinese government ministries
together with investors from Singapore, Thailand and Macao. The company's
seventh shareholder is a company owned by the Kuomintang, Taiwan's ruling
Nationalist party.
The satellite, known as Apstar 1, was launched from Xichang, Sichuan, on
July 21. It is estimated to have cost APT about Dollars 130m to buy, launch
and insure. Its twin, Apstar 2, is due for launch early next year.
Of crucial importance to existing operators is the positioning of a new
satellite. In general, the industry requires 2-2.5 degrees of separation -
1,488km - between satellites so that respective 'footprints' do not cause
interference.
The Chinese government last year registered Apstar 1's position, above the
equator in geostationary orbit, at 131 degrees east with the ITU. However,
at 132 degrees east is a planned Japanese communications satellite and at
130 degrees east is Rimsat1, which broadcasts for the Sun TV group of India.
Mr Yang Xueming, director of marketing at APT, denies that Apstar 1 will
cause other operators any difficulties.
However, satellite industry executives in Hong Kong said they were concerned
that Apstar 1 was launched without completing the industry's three-stage
co-ordination process.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Portillo call for cuts may test unity of government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major's cabinet was yesterday threatened by a serious split over
public spending plans after Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary,
called for a sharp reduction in state support for industry.
Mr Portillo's call, which came in a leaked letter to Mr Michael Heseltine,
the trade and industry secretary, was an early sign of the difficulties the
government could face in sticking to its tough spending targets in this
year's Budget.
But it also threatened to shake the uneasy truce between the left and right
wings of the Conservative party less than two weeks after Mr Major's cabinet
reshuffle.
Mr Portillo yesterday stood by the letter which he wrote to Mr Heseltine
last month in his former job as chief secretary to the Treasury.
In the letter, Mr Portillo berated Mr Heseltine for failing to support
policies to cut taxation and spending. He pressed the trade and industry
secretary to accept drastic cuts in a large number of DTI programmes,
including regional assistance grants, all support for shipbuilding and all
backing for an independent UK space programme.
Mr Heseltine's response to the letter is not known. However, he is known to
see a positive role for properly directed support for industry.
Treasury officials were yesterday anxious to play down any disagreement,
saying that discussion of these proposals was at an early stage and might
not form part of the forthcoming Budget.
Rightwing Tory MPs were confident that Mr Jonathan Aitken, the new chief
secretary, would take as hard a line as Mr Portillo. Mr Aitken has come to
the job with strong rightwing credentials and he masterminded many recent
cuts in the defence budget.
Mr Robin Cook, Labour's shadow trade and industry secretary, was concerned
the DTI's budget could be cut in this way.
'I am alarmed that any government minister could write a letter so dripping
in political dogma and so lacking in common sense,' he said. 'Britain
already invests less per head than any other European country in support for
industry.'
The Confederation of British Industry said while every element of government
spending should be reviewed the return on some measures of government
support for industry far exceeded the amounts of money involved.
However, Mr Tim Melville-Ross, on his first day as director-general of the
Institute of Directors, said it was right that all departments should make a
contribution to the fundamental review of public expenditure.
'In a situation in which markets work, there would be no need for government
intervention in industry or the regions,' he said.
Mr Portillo refused to elaborate any further on the contents of the letter,
saying he did not comment on leaks. 'Discussions between spending
departments and the Treasury do not imply decisions of government but a
healthy and appropriate debate about the proper role of government,' he
said. But there were signs the leak could become a political issue after the
Treasury launched an inquiry into how the letter became public.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Rate rise fears fade but markets still wary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN and PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears of an imminent rise in UK official interest rates receded yesterday,
but financial markets continued to signal that they expect an increase in
the next two months.
Indications strengthened that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the
exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, agreed to
leave base rates unchanged at 5.25 per cent at their monthly monetary
meeting last Thursday.
They will next meet to discuss interest rates on September 7, but an
indication of the Bank's views on the economy will emerge today when it
publishes its quarterly inflation report.
Yesterday, the Bank dealt at existing money market rates, reassuring those
who feared a base rate increase at the start of the trading week. The equity
market responded with relief, pushing the FT-SE 100 index up 14.8 points to
3,097.4.
But the mood in the money markets remained wary. Although there was a small
rally in short sterling, the futures market's medium for speculating on
interest rate changes, the contract continued to imply that short-term rates
would be nearly 6 per cent by the middle of September. Three-month interbank
offer rates also remained well above base rates, at 5 3/4 per cent.
Speculation of an immediate rate rise reached fever pitch last Friday after
the Bank decided to accept bids at an auction of three-month Treasury bills
at rates of up to 5.75 per cent. Traders saw this as a sign that base rates
were set to rise, even though the Bank, in its normal money market
operations on Friday, left dealing rates unchanged.
Unless interbank rates drop sharply, the Bank will face a repeat of last
week's dilemma on Friday, when the next Treasury bill auction occurs. It
will either have to accept bids at a level well above base rates or take the
unusual step of cancelling the auction. Last Friday, the Bank decided that
its actions were the less damaging of the two approaches.
Analysts said the divergence between Treasury bill rates and base rates
could not last for long, and the gap was likely to be closed by an increase
in the latter. Friday's events have left the government 'chasing, rather
than controlling' the process, said Mr Peter Lyon, global strategist at
securities house Smith New Court.

FT  02 AUG 94 / Japan angered by US sanctions threat

Japanese officials yesterday reacted with dismay to the US decision to start
a process which could lead to sanctions, as trade friction upset foreign
exchange markets and led to a sharp fall in the value of the dollar against
the yen.
The US and Canada, meanwhile, stepped back from a trade war over wheat.
Their negotiators agreed last night that Canada would limit wheat exports to
the US for a year while a commission looks into the grain trade.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, recognised that if Washington
did impose sanctions against Japan, the dollar could be hurt. 'Sometimes you
get an emotional impact that's temporary, but underlying economic
fundamentals take hold,' Mr Bentsen said.
Mr Kozo Igarashi, Japan's chief cabinet secretary, yesterday criticised the
US move as contrary to the spirit of dialogue which should be at the basis
of bilateral negotiations. 'The US action contradicts the US-Japan framework
talks which calls for addressing bilateral disputes through dialogue,' Mr
Igarashi said.
While Japan was still prepared to negotiate and would make strenuous efforts
to reach an agreement, in the event that sanctions are announced 'we have no
intention of continuing negotiations under threat of sanctions', he
emphasised.
The dollar fell more than Y1 1/2 in Tokyo yesterday to a low of Y98.38
before recovering to Y98.85 in London and to Y99.445 in New York. Early
today, it opened in Tokyo at Y99.325.
Until recently, a strong yen has been seen by markets as a possible means of
reducing Japan's bilateral trade surplus, and the dollar had weakened in
response to the belief that the US administration would not support it.
However, Mr Bentsen's comments yesterday underlined more recent signs that
the administration is not prepared to let the dollar slip further.
Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's prime minister, was hopeful yesterday that the
two countries would resolve their dispute over public procurement of medical
equipment and telecommunications before a US-imposed September 30 deadline
for announcing sanctions.
'The talks have not completely broken down, so we must persevere with the
negotiations,' Mr Murayama said.
The Japanese stance reflects a widespread feeling in Tokyo that an agreement
is possible. Officials are also aware that the US has rarely imposed
sanctions under its trade laws. The stumbling block is over US insistence on
language promising 'significant progress' in opening Japanese markets.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Working Life: A chance to raise the standards at your
workplace - Training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Does your employer communicate effectively with you? Do you feel that your
training is appropriate to the demands of your job?
If the answer is no, your company might be a candidate for the Investors in
People standard which, among a number of other functions, offers a system of
auditing the way a company manages its human resources.
The standard, which was government inspired, is managed by Training and
Enterprise Councils, which administer government-funded training programmes
and foster enterprise.
Four years old this November, the scheme got off to a slow start but take-up
is now gaining momentum, with Provincial Insurance the thousandth company to
achieve it. Barbara Clifford, marketing manager at Provincial, said: 'The
process has been extremely valuable for us. It followed a period of
restructuring and it focused minds on the future.'
So far the standard has been adopted by companies representing 15 per cent
of the UK workforce. But many of the earliest participants were businesses
which probably had above average employment practices already.
How successful has the standard been? It is not yet certain that numerical
government targets for the take-up of IIP will be reached. Ms Mary Chapman,
chief executive of Investors in People UK, which polices the standard, last
week described the target of 50 per cent of UK organisations employing more
than 200 being recognised as IIP organisations by the end of 1996 as
'challenging'.
However, there seems considerable satisfaction with the standard, which has
been taken up by a raft of organisations, from big public sector
organisations to schools. A recent survey by Industrial Relations Services,
the independent research organisation said 96 per cent of companies that had
gone through the process expressed satisfaction with it.
But one task for the next few years will be to percolate IIP down to more
small businesses, where training and staff development are generally
regarded as lacking.
In Worcestershire 30 per cent of all employees in the area covered by
Central England Training and Enterprise Council work for companies that have
obtained the standard or are moving towards it. However, they are employed
by 200 companies in an area which has 12,000 businesses.
Mr Rodney Skidmore, chief executive of Centec, said it was becoming easier
to involve small companies. 'It is important to have role models that small
companies can identify with. But, people still have to be convinced that it
offers real benefits and that it is not a gimmick,' he said.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Geneva talks stave off war in ex-Yugoslavia - for a while:
Gloomy prospect from Bosnia 'contact group' discussions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The spectre of war spreading through former Yugoslavia has been staved off,
but only a small amount of time, perhaps just a few weeks, has been gained.
That was the gloomy prospect to emerge from the weekend's talks in Geneva
among the five-nation 'contact group' on Bosnia.
Foreign ministers from the US, Russia, the UK, France and Germany, plus
Greece as the outgoing chairman of the European Union, met to select a mix
of carrots and sticks to drive on their peace initiative, slow to move
forward since its birth last month. They were also keen to prevent the
Balkan conflict from poisoning their relations with one another.
The plan would in effect divide Bosnia between the Serbs and a Moslem-Croat
alliance, with the Serbs cutting their share of territory from 70 to 49 per
cent. Faced with a 'yes' from Bosnia's Moslem leaders and a virtual 'no'
from the Bosnian Serbs, the ministers agreed on a gradual escalation of
pressure, while keeping the door open.
They pledged to reinforce and broaden the flagging regime of sanctions
against the Yugoslav republic (which now consists of Serbia and Montenegro);
and also to police more strictly Bosnia's exclusion zones designed to
protect Moslems.
A new resolution on sanctions could be presented to the Security Council
within a week, and by the end of this month, Nato should have devised a way
to use more air power against the Serbs without leaving UN's ground troops
too vulnerable.
As part of the attempt to reinforce sanctions, the ministers pledged to
approach Serbia's neighbours and offer financial compensation in return for
policing borders more tightly.
The US delegation, led by the secretary of state, Mr Warren Christopher,
came away from Geneva frustrated because of the mildness of the proposed
action against the Serbs.
In a bow to congressional pressure for a unilateral US move to permit arms
supplies to the Moslems, Mr Christopher said: 'We are not prepared to see
this process strung out indefinitely. We cannot continue this situation
where the victims are punished by the arms embargo and are denied the right
to defend themselves.'
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, retorted that 'hot-heads'
in the Moscow parliament would respond to any unilateral US move by pulling
out of economic sanctions against the Serbs.
It was clear in Geneva that Russia feels no enthusiasm whatsoever for the
idea of intensifying economic pressure on Serb leaders in Belgrade, who are
viewed in Moscow as a helpful influence on their kinsmen in Bosnia.
Mr Kozyrev did grudgingly sign up to the principle of tightening existing
sanctions and exclusion zones; but he saw it as a necessary price for
damping US zeal for the idea of allowing arms supplies to the Moslems.
The Russian minister views the 'arm-the-Moslems' slogan with unmitigated
dismay, and this alarm is broadly shared by the governments of Britain and
France.
All three governments made it clear they would withdrew their troops, which
form the mainstay of the UN's peacekeeping and humanitarian operation, in
the event of conflict reigniting and spreading.
Yet Mr Kozyrev is aware of the desperate need to induce the Bosnian Serbs to
come up with a more plausible position, if US enthusiasm for a 'fair fight'
is to be kept under control.
Because the contact group's map was presented on a 'take-it-or-leave-it'
basis, there seems to be little room for the Serbs to modify their position
and parry international anger - except through outright acceptance.
Yet senior UK officials did see some scope for further negotiations at the
margins of the plan.
The contact group will not change its territorial proposals, but in
principle the parties could do so by mutual agreement, they point out.
Also, the peace plan does not lay down the constitutional arrangements - so
that too is open to negotiation.
Some observers see potential for give-and-take over Sarajevo, where the
Serbs have hinted they would sacrifice the suburbs they control in return
for territory elsewhere. In the words of one UK official: 'We have told the
Serbs that it is no use saying 'Yes, but. . .' However, they could say 'Yes,
and. . . '
Both Mr Kozyrev, and his Greek counterpart, Mr Karolos Papoulias, stressed
that they viewed some softening in the Serb position as both desirable and
possible.
Yet even in the unlikely event of the Serbs coming round to virtual
acceptance of the plan, the Bosnian government is likely - to judge from the
statements of Moslem commanders - to seek ways of wriggling out of its own
commitment.
So the danger of an intensified war, which could spread northwards to
Croatia and possibly southwards, to pit Slavs against Albanians, will not go
away. This danger seems to weigh more heavily on European governments than
in Washington.
Where US politicians cling tenaciously to belief in 'righting wrongs', the
foreign ministries of Europe have taken a more cautious attitude which
stresses the need to limit damage and avoid further bloodshed.
The Geneva meeting threw up repeated examples of a contrast in approaches
between the US on one hand and all the Europeans - British, French and
Russian - on the other. The European countries were at pains to stress the
fragility of recent achievements, including the relative normalisation of
life in Sarajevo and central Bosnia.
All these achievements, they have pointed out, would be scuppered in the
event of a general conflagration with Russia supporting one side and the US
the other.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev and Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, both made
the point that disagreements over Bosnia among the the big powers have had
some disastrous consequences in the past.
This, they implied, was a reason why the powers involved in Bosnian
peace-broking should struggle to overcome their differences of approach, and
to prevent these differences from poisoning their broader relationship.
'This century has many examples of what happens when other countries
disagree about the Balkans,' said Mr Hurd, referring to the start of of the
first world war 80 years ago after an assassination in Sarajevo.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Poles mourn dead of 1944 Warsaw Uprising
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Poles paid tribute yesterday to the 200,000 victims of the 1944 Warsaw
Uprising against Nazi occupation when they commemorated the 50th anniversary
of one the bloodiest battles of the second world war.
Red and white Polish flags lined streets as masses were held and prayers
were said in the Warsaw synagogue before today's main ceremonies which will
be attended by German President Roman Herzog, US Vice-President Al Gore,
British Prime Minister John Major and a Russian presidential aide.
The German and Russian presence has angered some veterans because of the
Nazi brutality during the uprising and Moscow's failure to come to their
aid. But President Herzog and Polish President Lech Walesa have said it is
now time for reconciliation.
'We Germans and Poles must find some way of putting our relations in order.
Otherwise a wound will still divide Europe across its centre,' Mr Herzog
said in an interview with Polish television broadcast on Saturday night.
The uprising began on August 1 1944, and ended in capitulation the following
October 2 after weeks of bombardment and hunger. By the time the Soviet army
entered Warsaw on January 17 1945, few buildings were left standing.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Trial sought over Milan contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An Italian prosecutor has applied for a trial on corruption charges of 41
people, including two ex-mayors of Milan and two former executives of Fiat,
judicial sources said yesterday, Reuter reports from Milan.
A senior judge must now rule whether there is enough evidence to try the
defendants.
Milan prosecutor Mr Paolo Ielo sought the trial at the end of an inquiry
into alleged bribes paid to political parties to win business from Milan's
public transport authority. The investigation into corrupt practices over
the distribution of contracts for the Milan metro was one of the first big
investigations by Milan magistrates begun two years ago.
The two ex-Fiat executives are former finance director Mr Francesco Paolo
Mattioli and Mr Antonio Mosconi, former vice-chairman of its Cogefar
Impresit building subsidiary. Mr Ielo has asked for them to be tried on
corruption charges.
Mr Ielo alleges that bribes worth four to five per cent of the contracts to
buy buses for Milan's public transport network were paid to political
parties between 1978 and 1992. He also applied for former Milan mayors Mr
Carlo Tognoli and Mr Paolo Pilliteri and 37 other politicians and
businessmen to be tried on charges of paying and taking bribes.
Mr Pilliteri, a member of the Socialist party, is the brother-in-law of Mr
Bettino Craxi, the former prime minister sentenced in absentia last Friday
to eight and a half years in jail in another corruption case.
A Rome judge last week dropped charges against Mr Mattioli, ruling there was
insufficient evidence to try him on charges of corruption in the building of
the capital's metro railway.
In another development, judicial sources said an aide to Mr Antonio Di
Pietro, the country's best-known anti-corruption magistrate, was arrested at
the weekend as part of Mr Di Pietro's latest inquiries.
Mr Giuliano Montanari, a finance police officer, was detained as part of an
investigation into bribes paid by businessmen to the force in return for
easy treatment, the sources said.

Monday: As the markets buzz in anticipation of a UK base rate rise and the
publication of the Bank of England's quarterly bulletin, UK figures will be
watched with particular interest this week.
Today's data on M0, the narrowest measure of the money supply, is expected
to show a slight slowdown in its annual growth rate. But with the market
forecasting a 6.3 per cent annual increase, the rate is still well outside
the government's monitoring band of 0-4 per cent.
Tuesday: With Germany's economic recovery proceeding faster than many had
dared hope, June's industrial production and manufacturing output data,
which are due out today or tomorrow, will be watched with interest.
A strong increase in output is expected, following a slight fall last month.
Friday: UK manufacturing and output data due today will provide further
indications of the strength of the UK recovery, with a small pick-up in the
rate of monthly growth expected.
In the US, a spate of industrial production and employment data is expected
to point to continued strong recovery.

Lukashenko meets Yeltsin
Alexander Lukashenko, the newly elected president of Belarus, meets Russia's
president Boris Yeltsin in Moscow. Lukashenko came in on a ticket of union
with Russia and has said that the Belarus economic crisis cannot be solved
without Russian aid.
Silvio Berlusconi, the embattled Italian premier, will make a statement to
parliament on his growing confrontation with the judiciary. He is expected
to use the opportunity to clarify the conflict of interest between his role
as prime minister and the ownership of his Fininvest empire.
Rwandan crisis: Donor countries meet in Geneva to discuss the United
Nation's humanitarian aid effort for Rwanda and pledge contributions to the
UN's Dollars 434m appeal launched on July 22. The worst postwar refugee
crisis has seen the uprooting of half Rwanda's 7m population, a ravaging
cholera epidemic among refugees in Zaire and the slaughter of half a million
civilians.
US vice-president, Al Gore, arrives in Kiev for a one-day official visit
with Ukraine's new leadership. Mr Gore comes on the personal invitation of
President Leonid Kuchma, just two weeks in office. Discussions are to focus
on Ukraine's progress in dismantling its nuclear arsenal and launching
economic reforms.
UK economy: The Bank of England's quarterly inflation report, published this
afternoon, may be used as justification for a change in base rates, as it
was in February. Even if rates are unchanged, the market will scan the
report for the Bank's expectations of inflation rates in the medium term.
Kuwaiti and US troops will start a 12-day joint military exercise to

3 WEDNESDAY
Fed releases Beige Book
The US Federal Reserve releases its Beige Book, an up-to-date compendium of
regional reports on the US economy. The Commerce Department's report on
leading economic indicators for June is expected to climb, pushed by rises
in orders for new plant and equiment and materials prices.
Nigeria: A general strike is threatened in Nigeria from today amid rising
concern that the country's worst crisis in decades could degenerate into
ethnic chaos.
Nigeria is suffering from a complete polarisation between the military
government of General Sani Abacha and the pro-democracy supporters of
Moshood Abiola, who is being detained on treason charges after declaring
himself victor in a 1993 election that was later annulled.
Cuba's parliament debates a new tax law when it meets in ordinary session
today. Authorities on the Caribbean island have been laying the groundwork
for the gradual introduction of some personal taxes, as part of a cautious
process of economic reform. The aim is to bring order to the country's
internal finances by reducing pesos in circulation and cutting the budget
deficit.
Anti-atomic rally in Hiroshima:
A representative of Japan's ruling conservative Liberal Democratic Party is
to attend, for the first time, the annual World Rally against Atomic and
Hydrogen Bombs, in Hiroshima (to August 6). The LDP has never in its 39-year
life sent an official delegation to rallies calling for a ban on nuclear
weapons. The rally is backed by the LDP's coalition partner, the left-wing
Social Democratic Party, its traditional enemy until the formation of
Japan's latest coalition government in late June.
US-NZ relations: US assistant secretary of state Winston Lord starts a
two-day visit to New Zealand. It is the latest step in a gradual improvement
of relations after a seven-year rift. The State Department suspended senior
level contacts with New Zealand in 1987 because of legislation banning
nuclear-armed and nuclear-propelled vessels from the country's ports.
Banana dispute: Representatives from eight Latin American banana-producing
countries are meeting in Nicaragua to try to end a dispute over import
quotas in Europe. Unlike the other Latin American staple export - coffee -
bananas have been floundering at 10-year price lows on the international
markets.
4 THURSDAY
Court decision on Nasreen
A court in Dhaka is due to consider whether to declare Taslima Nasreen a
fugitive. Anybody sheltering her would then be committing an offence.
The feminist Bangladeshi writer is in hiding following death threats because
she allegedly insulted Islam. Last week she received an invitation to visit
Norway, which could defuse the situation by getting her out of Bangladesh.
Tin mine: Managers at Britain's last operating tin mine, South Crofty,
Cornwall, will know today if their share offering has raised enough to get
them through the next 18 months, when they hope tin prices will be higher.
If Pounds 1m is raised by midnight, the UK government and RTZ Corporation
will write off loans of Pounds 30.4m (Dollars 47m). Otherwise, the future
looks bleak.
Saleroom: Batman and Superman slug it out in South Kensington as Christie's
London office holds its first sale of comics. It includes the first editions
to feature the American heroes: Superman in Action Comics on June 1 1938,
and Batman in Detective Comics in May 1939. The Batman comic, the rarer of
the two, has an estimated value of Pounds 30,000-Pounds 40,000. The Superman
comic is estimated at Pounds 15,000-Pounds 20,000.
Basketball world championships open in Toronto (to August 14).

Headingley, Leeds (to August 8).
5 FRIDAY
N Korea-US talks resume
The US and North Korea are scheduled to resume high-level talks in Geneva on
international inspection of North Korea's nuclear programme. Discussions,
which began on July 8, were suspended after one day following the death of
President Kim Il-sung.
Pyongyang has promised to suspend its nuclear operations if progress is
achieved, including possible US diplomatic recognition and economic aid in
return for full inspections.
The talks will be the first main test for North Korea's new leader, Mr Kim
Jong-il, the son of the late president.
US economy: The Labour Department may drop the unemployment rate from 6 per
cent to 5.9 per cent. This could alarm the Federal Reserve, ever alert to
early signs of tightening labour markets.
Nigeria is host to a summit of West African heads of state.
Chinese index: An index for Chinese enterprises listed on the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange is launched today. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index
comprises the 10 H-share companies.
Exit Graces: Unless Pounds 7.6m (Dollars 11.8m) is raised by today, Stephen
Dorrell, UK national heritage secretary, will allow an export licence to the
Getty Museum, California, for Canova's neo-classical sculpture The Three
Graces. It is not expected that a sum to match the Getty's purchase price
will be raised.
6-7 WEEKEND
Samper becomes president
Outgoing Colombian president, Cesar Gaviria, is due to hand over power on
Sunday to president-elect Ernesto Samper, who narrowly won the May 19
election. Mr Gaviria is to become secretary-general of the Organisation of
American States.
Hiroshima ceremony: Peace Memorial ceremonies take place on Saturday to mark
the anniversary of the 1945 atomic bombing of the city.
Aids conference: The 10th international conference on Aids starts on Sunday.
This year's week-long event in Yokohama is likely to be smaller than last
year's in Berlin, not because of a lack of scientific developments, but
simply because of the expense of travelling to and staying in Japan.
The conference is expected to yield details of trials showing that the drug
AZT can inhibit transmission of HIV from mother to child, and news about the
effectiveness of using three drugs in combination.
Guinea-Bissau vote: The second round run-off in the presidential elections
in the west African republic is held on Sunday. In the first round on July
3, head of state Joao Bernardo Vieirafell fell short of an outright majority
against the leading opposition candidate, Kumba Yala.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Austrian sales indicate a desire for the
real thing - International Offerings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest wave of Austrian privatisations indicates the government is
finally relinquishing its tight grip on the country's banking and
manufacturing industry.
Moving away from the late 1980s policy of phony privatisations, when it sold
minority shares in state assets but always retained majority or voting
control, there are growing signs that the government is finally going for
the real thing.
That was borne out by last week's completion of the privatisation of Austria
Mikro-Systeme International (AMS), which became the first company in Austria
to be completely privatised.
The flotation in May of 51 per cent of VA Technologie, and the planned
disposal by the government of its 26 per cent blocking minority in VAE
Eisenbahnsysteme in the autumn, also indicate the government means business.
Progress on other privatisation projects - notably OMV and
Creditanstalt-Bankverein - has been less encouraging. The sale of 20 per
cent of OMV to Abu Dhabi in May still leaves the government with a 52 per
cent holding. It promises to sell more, but investors could be forgiven for
believing the desire to retain an Austrian majority still stands.
The ongoing squabble over Creditanstalt, the country's number two bank,
could further fuel such suspicions.
The government, which holds 49 per cent of Creditanstalt equity and 70 per
cent of the voting rights, wants to sell part of its holdings before the end
of the year. But a political dispute - intensified by political mudslinging
and horsetrading in the run-up to the October 9 general elections - has
arisen over the rival bids which it has received.
The first bid came from CS Holding, the big Swiss international financial
group, which hopes eventually to own 100 per cent of the bank.
Mr Ferdinand Lacina, finance minister and member of the Social Democratic
party, made clear at an early stage that he looked favourably on the CS bid.
But Austria's conservative business establishment, fearing that
Creditanstalt under CS would become less sympathetic to their interests,
quickly put together a consortium to make a counter bid.
Germany's Allianz insurance group joined the fray, confirming last week that
it is interested in Creditanstalt, although it has yet to make a formal
offer.
'The whole thing is rather messy and isn't doing a lot of good for
Creditanstalt,' grumbles an Austrian banker, who says he leans towards the
CS Holding offer. 'If the consortium gets in, everyone will want to have a
say, whereas under CS Holding, there would at least be a clear-cut
strategy.'
In spite of official foot-dragging, Austrian equity issuance is expected to
pick up again once the elections are over and the international equity
markets come back to life.
The next wave of privatisations is expected to include the sale of the state
holding company OIAG's remaining 26 per cent stake in VAE Eisenbahnsysteme;
the partial sale of companies such as Creditanstalt, Bank Austria; and the
privatisation of the few remaining viable firms belonging to OIAG.
Further sales of shares of Verbund, the big national electricity producer,
and EVN, the Lower Austrian electricity and gas utility, may also be on the
cards.
Although Austrian equities have had an impressive run in recent months,
their outlook remains rosy, supply notwithstanding, in a market expected to
benefit from steady, low-inflation growth lifted by EU membership and
accompanied by further cuts in short-term rates.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Pause for breath as old fears niggle -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The disappointing response to last week's auction of Pounds 2bn government
securities, and the renewed nervousness in gilts on base rate worries, is
potentially alarming for equities. Just when the investment strategists were
congratulating the market on successfully shifting from an interest rate to
an earnings-driven phase, all the old fears seem to be returning.
Or perhaps not. While BZW and Strauss Turnbull, to name only two, quickly
revised their views on base rates in the light of the manufacturing sector
survey from the Confederation of British Industry, there seems little
overall change in views on prospects for the equity market.
Unfortunately, Friday afternoon provided a sudden challenge to near-term
prospects on the interest rate front.
The Bank of England's willingness to see short-term rates rise dramatically
brought the fear that the authorities planned a defensive strike - by
raising base rates without waiting for inflation prospects to worsen.
Both BZW and Strauss Turnbull went on to emphasise that the strength of
recovery in equities implies that share prices still have a good deal
further to go before interest rate worries become a serious problem.
Strauss is raising its year-end Footsie target to 3,350-3,500, with next
year expected to bring the index within a 3,600-3,750 range. The reasons
given are the strong growth in gross domestic product in the UK, as
elsewhere in Europe. Strauss sees growth of share earnings at near 50 per
cent this year and next, with growth in dividends at a cumulative 21 per
cent over the two years.
NatWest Securities stresses that economic fundamentals 'do not point to an
immediate rate rise'. At Kleinwort Benson, Mr Albert Edwards comments that
the gilts failure merely emphasises 'equity headwinds'.
The UK market is still seen, admittedly by London-based analysts, as one of
the most attractively
valued international markets, a view which had been strengthened by the fall
in sterling against the D-Mark until that trend was reversed on Friday
afternoon.
The City of London has turned nervous ahead of tomorrow's Bank of England
Quarterly Bulletin which, so the market rumours ran, will confirm that the
Bank is worried about inflation and determined to ensure that Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, does not forget it.
Equities now stand at a yield discount to index-linked gilts, and this
alone, comments S. G. Warburg, suggests that a pause by equities is
warranted in the high-yielding equities which have been leading the stock
market forward.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Data provide good omens for bulls - New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After Friday's 33-point rally by the Dow industrials, share prices could
fall prey to profit-taking this morning, but the outlook for the week is
decidedly bullish. Indeed, the mood on Wall Street has turned full circle in
the past seven days.
At last week's opening, investors were wringing their hands over the
prospect of an imminent move by the Federal Reserve to push up interest
rates. When Mr Alan Greenspan warned that it was an open question whether
the Fed would lift rates in the near future, most market watchers were
convinced a decision to do so had already been made.
This morning, with the Commerce Department's preliminary readings on
second-quarter economic growth out of the way, the pundits are not so sure.
'The surprise was that there was no surprise,' says Mr Hugh Johnson, chief
investment officer at First Albany, the New York securities house, remarking
on Friday's announcement that the economy grew at a 3.7 per cent rate, a
shade below the consensus forecast. With Mr Greenspan's words ringing in
their ears, some investors had feared growth would come closer to 5 per
cent.
Still, a backward view of the fundamentals usually fails to shift sentiment
so radically. But Friday's data also included news of big jump in business
inventories, which suggests the economy had produced goods faster than
consumers could buy them. 'That's not a good omen for future growth,' says
Mr Martin Regalia, chief economist for the Chamber of Commerce.
It's a good omen for share prices, however. Combined with a more stable
dollar, the GDP data lessened the likelihood that the Fed will tighten
credit before its August 16 policy-making session.
'The report could not have come at a better time,' says Mr Johnson, assuming
a contrary viewpoint. Last week, 'bearishness was becoming very widespread
and embedded. That's when it's time to start thinking positive.'
The First Albany analyst expects this week's economic news to reinforce the
favourable outlook. The July survey of the National Association of
Purchasing Management, due out today, is likely to show a decline in
manufacturing activity. The index of leading economic indicators, scheduled
for Wednesday, should show no change for the fourth month in a row.
Friday's crucial employment data is expected to bring the most reliable
confirmation of a moderating economic trend. Non-farm payrolls are thought
to have grown by 200,000 last month.
If so, Mr Alfred Goldman, technical analyst at AG Edwards in St Louis, sees
a sustained move forward by stocks. 'There could be some resistance at the
3,800 level,' he says, 'but the market is sure to break through before
long.'

CHEMICALS
Generally good results are expected this week from DSM and Akzo Nobel, the
Dutch chemicals groups, as well as the French group Rhone-Poulenc, writes
John Pitt.
These three will be followed later in the month by the three leading German
groups, all of which should confirm the positive state of the industry.
Hoare Govett comments that over the past six months the volumes for a number
of basic chemical products has improved strongly, while demand/supply ratios
have become relatively tight.
'As a result, pricing has slowly started to strengthen.'
Hoare favours the Dutch groups, and believes that the second-quarter results
will provide a pleasant surprise. However, it remains more cautious on the
French company.
'We still believe the long-term prospects to be sound, but the second
quarter might be somewhat disappointing as the possibility of negative
surprises in the financials (as in the first quarter) cannot be excluded.'
Goldman Sachs tends to agree, while also highlighting the strength of the
German groups.
In all, says Goldman, the stabilisation of the dollar and a return of
confidence to the financial markets 'can be expected to lead to a renewed
period of outperformance for the sector'.
Paribas also rates Bayer as a buy, along with more defensive companies such
as Henkel and Air Liquide, but it too highlights the Dutch and French groups
as buys.
BANKS
The Swiss bank reporting season continues this week with half-year figures,
expected on Wednesday, from UBS.
Analysts are forecasting that the Big Three banks will show sharply lower
earnings during the first half of 1994 after exceptional trading profits
made during the 1993 stock market spree. Half-year profits at UBS, the
country's largest bank, are expected to have fallen by between 28 per cent
and 35 per cent due to a 45 per cent to 50 per cent drop in trading income.
Better-than-expected results could breath fresh life into the stock market
after last week's largely downbeat performance. However, one analyst warned
that bad news from the banks could see a slide of up to 10 per cent in their
share prices which would be carried over into a 3 per cent to 4 per cent
fall for the market as a whole.
The German reporting season continues this week with figures from BHF-Bank,
Vereinsbank and Hypo-Bank.
MILAN
Politics is likely to remain firmly in the driving seat this week, after
last week's excursions which saw the market fall by almost 5 per cent in the
first three days before a more positive tone emerged.
However, the market still has its supporters. UBS says that there is much in
Italy that now looks good value for the ocean-faring investor with good sea
legs.
The currency is undervalued, 10-year bonds offer a yield seven points above
the current inflation rate, and the equity market has fallen sharply since
May, in spite of promising growth prospects.
HONG KONG
China enterprises, listed on the Hang Seng Index - the so-called H shares -
are likely to remain at the centre of investors' attention this week, ahead
of the launch of the new Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which starts
next Monday, writes Louise Lucas.
Strong demand pushed prices of the H shares up last week, ending a sluggish
period for the counters.
There are now 10 H shares trading on the Hong Kong market; Qingling Motors
will become the eleventh when its shares start trading on August 17.
The reporting season is now under way, although the blue chip sector will do
not begin to give details until the middle of the month.
However, Guangzhou Shipyard International - one of last year's H share
listings - unveils its interims on
Friday.
Brokers reckon trading will be in a narrow range. On the plus side,
sentiment has improved following the better than expected results achieved
at last Tuesday's land auction. But on the downside, concerns remain over US
interest rates and the overheating economy in China.
Turnover is expected to settle down after a surge towards the end of last
week, inspired by the expiration of July futures contracts.
TOKYO
Confidence, lifted by last week's buying by public funds, is expected to
remain firm as worries about Nikkei index falling below 20,000 have
subsided.
However, aggressive buying above 20,500 is unlikely because of lingering
concerns over the yen and corporate profits, writes Emiko Terazono.
Dealers and individual investors may actively trade Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone and East Japan Railway, two semi-privatised companies, ahead of
the auction for Japan Tobacco's share offering in mid-August.

FT  01 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: Not all gloom and doom in Italy -
Capital &amp; Credit

Investing in Italian government bonds has never been for the faint-hearted,
given the country's tradition of political turbulence, so the latest drop in
the market should come as no surprise to the seasoned investor.
Ever since the fledgling government headed by Mr Silvio Berlusconi started
to crack under the combined weight of the premier's embarrassing climbdowns
and the allegations of corruption, Italian bonds and the lira have been on a
slippery slope.
By the end of last week, the yield spread on 10-year Italian bonds stood at
412 basis points over their German counterparts. In late April, the
post-election euphoria had caused this spread to narrow to around 250 basis
points. Meanwhile, the lira has been hovering around L1,000 to the D-Mark,
close to its all-time low of L1,006.
There are signs, too, that international investors have been voting with
their feet. 'The last five weeks have seen a large shift out of Italian
bonds by foreign investors into other high-yielding markets such as Spain or
Denmark,' says Mr Andrew King, investment manager at Swiss fund managers,
Lombard Odier.
He cites Italian Ministry of Finance figures which show a 1 1/2 per cent
drop in foreign holdings of Italian government debt to 9 per cent from May
to June. The chances are that the June-July figures will show a further
decline.
However, in spite of the mood of animosity towards the Italian market, there
are several factors which could prompt a sudden turnround in sentiment.
'Italy is a market which goes in peaks and troughs, and we are undoubtedly
in a major trough,' says Mr Darren Williams, European fixed-income analyst
at Merrill Lynch. 'However, unless you are assuming a total disaster
scenario, things will improve.'
Mr Ken Wattret, international economist at Midland Global Markets, says the
market could recover quickly once investor attention shifts from the
government's woes to Italy's positive economic outlook.
Inflation in Italy is now at its lowest level since late 1969, and at 3.7
per cent is not far above Germany's 2.9 per cent. 'Italy's inflation rate is
much better than the market was expecting but so far the news has been
over-ridden by the political situation,' says Mr Wattret.
Another factor in Italy's favour is that the domestic situation has not
caused the yield spreads on its foreign-currency bonds to widen
significantly and its credit rating has not come under threat. 'The feeling
is that the rating agencies went too far last time, so this acts as some
sort of cushion,' says Mr King. However, he adds that the rating agencies
would take a dim view if the government fails to take steps to correct the
country's enormous budget deficit.
In this respect, the Italian Treasury would do well to persuade Mr Alberto
Giovannini, the academic credited with restoring Italy's credibility in the
international bond market, to stay on after his two-year consultancy period
expires. There has been speculation that Mr Giovannini will return to
Columbia University in the autumn but last week the sphinx-like professor
was giving nothing away.
Although there is still a danger that Italian bonds will fall further over
the summer as the corruption bandwagon rumbles on, analysts are confident
that the brave will be rewarded in the long term. Mr Wattret forecasts that
the lira will recover to L940 to the D-Mark by the year-end and that the
spread over German government bonds will narrow to 270 basis points by
February next year. Mr Williams believes the spread will come below 350
basis points and that the lira will rebound by as much as 20 per cent once
the political situation stabilises.
In spite of their defensive attitude towards the Italian market,
international investors know that they cannot boycott it for long. Because
of its large weighting in the global bond indices against which their
performance is measured, they need to hold Italian bonds or find a proxy for
them. Italy accounts for just under 7 per cent of Salomon Brothers' world
government bond index and is the fourth-biggest component after the US,
Japan and Germany.
Unlike Spanish and Danish bond markets, where they exert considerable
influence, international investors are not such big players in Italy where
the domestic investors still call the tune.
'And the Italians are still prepared to believe that Berlusconi will be a a
winner,' says Mr Wattret.

Although investors continue to be wary of committing funds in large amounts
into the Japanese bond market due to increasing signs of economic recovery
and the possibility of a rebound in the dollar, the yield on the No 164
10-year government bond is expected to remain within a range of 4.2 per cent
to 4.4 per cent over the next few weeks.
A shift in bond portfolios by Japanese institutional investors from mid-term
bonds to long-term government paper is likely to continue to provide support
for the Tokyo bond market. Life assurers and financial institutions are
reluctant to buy up the market, but are ready to purchase long-term bonds
around the 4.4 per cent to 4.5 per cent level due to the lack of risk-free
high-yielding investments.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo reckons yields at around 4.5 per cent for
government bonds are too high considering the low rate of inflation: 'Given
the 0.3 per cent year-on-year decline in Tokyo prices in July, and the core
rate of 0.7 per cent, it is clear that even official inflation measures are
catching up with the reality of declining prices for consumer goods.'
Over-supply concerns are likely to subside. Last week's 10-year government
bond auction saw active demand, with Y1,622bn of bids for Y600bn of
available bonds.

FT  01 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: Investors stay cool on Ecu sector -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fortunes of the Ecu bond market have risen and fallen as the prospects
for European monetary union, with the Ecu as Europe's single currency, have
grown and then receded.
The market was dealt a severe blow when the Danes rejected the Maastricht
Treaty at their first referendum in June 1992, and then again three months
later when sterling and the Italian lira were unceremoniously dumped from
the European exchange rate mechanism.
A year on, in August 1993, the French franc's woes and the widening of the
ERM's bands which occurred as a result precipitated a further sell-off in
Ecu bonds.
Suddenly the market that promised so much had collapsed and it has remained
in the doldrums ever since. Today, issuers and investors alike are scarce.
In June, the yield on the 10-year Ecu bond climbed to 46 basis over its
theoretical counterpart.
The theoretical yield is the yield which would result from constructing a
synthetic Ecu bond from the underlying constituent markets. The actual yield
is that earned from Ecu bonds trading in the market. The comparison of the
two is a good measure of the Ecu bond market's health.
However, 'it is wrong to be too pessimistic about the Ecu bond market', says
Mr Steve Major, head of bond research at Credit Lyonnais in Paris. 'The
performance in absolute terms has been poor but it must be viewed in
context. Government bond markets and other eurobond markets have also had a
disastrous year.'
Certainly, Ecu bonds have been one of the hardest hit as confidence in
Europe's bond markets has evaporated over worries about the size of
government borrowing, inflation and the direction of European interest
rates.
'Two factors have kept the market in the doldrums,' said Mr Philip Cadiz, of
Paribas in Paris.
'One is the fact that EMU seems to have become less of a political
likelihood; the other is this year's protracted and vicious bear market
which has meant that investors have concentrated on their own domestic
markets.'
The bear market looks set to continue for a while yet. With political
troubles in Italy adding to the uncertainty, and the wranglings over
choosing the successor to Jacques Delors as president of the European
Commission presenting the picture of an increasingly divided Europe, the
prospect for the Ecu market would not seem to be a bright one.
Nevertheless, some analysts have recently become more optimistic. 'We have
begun to see some buying interest in the last few months, from institutions
in particular but also from retail investors with money to spend, both
attracted by the relatively high yields,' said Mr Major. Since its peak in
mid-June, the gap between the actual and theoretical yields has closed.
Actual Ecu bonds are now trading two basis points below their theoretical
counterpart.
'Between 75 per cent to 80 per cent of Ecu debt is issued by governments or
organisations such as the World Bank and European Investment Bank, which
means that this is a high quality market with little risk for the investor,'
said Mr Danny Peeters, head of the Ecu desk at Kredietbank in Brussels.
The biggest buyers of Ecu debt are the Benelux countries, Switzerland and,
more recently, German banks have been attracted by the high yields on offer.
'If I were in their position, I would also be tempted,' said Mr Major.
'There is about DM180bn worth of German debt to be issued this year, which
represents a huge supply. The Ecu market does not have those supply
concerns.'
However, there has been some disappointment that less than half of the Ecu
funds currently being freed as many old Ecu bonds come up for redemption,
estimated to be about ECU1bn each month, are not being reinvested in Ecu
bonds.
In addition, the market continues to suffer from a lack of aggressive
marketing of the debt, which has been the case ever since several of the
large investment banks pulled many of its resources out of the Ecu bond
market.
The largest issuer of Ecu debt continues to be the French government, but
even it is limited to small offerings by the expensiveness of current
yields.
'Most recent issues have been small, which means that investors are not
focusing on the Ecu bond market,' said Mr Cadiz. 'If it is to be
resuscitated, we need to begin to focus again on the Ecu and on EMU. At the
moment, these are the last things on people's minds.'
Even if there is a recovery in Europe's bond markets, until monetary union
and the adoption of the Ecu as Europe's single currency become more than a
distant dream, a reversal in the Ecu bond market's fortunes will be
difficult.

'We must be very careful that economic recovery does not bring the fall in
inflation to a standstill or steer it in the opposite direction,' Mr Helmut
Schreiber, a Bundesbank director said on Friday.
While his statement had no discernible effect on German bond markets,
snoozing in the summer lull, it could be read as an indication that the
Bundesbank feels some interest rate forecasters are taking too much for
granted.
While most are still confident that west German inflation will fall from the
July rate of 2.9 per cent to around 2.5 per cent at the turn of the year,
there are growing doubts about how much further it will decline before
edging upwards - dragging rates along with it.
Raw material prices have climbed relatively steeply since the end of the
first quarter, and improved exports and stabilising domestic demand may
tempt some to raise product prices, Berliner Bank noted at the weekend.
Industrial output and order figures, due this week with unemployment
numbers, will give some indications of how the recovery is moving. But the
key number for the markets is July's money supply, not due for three weeks.
Until then sentiment is likely to continue to be dominated by external
factors, notably US rate expectations, and the nervousness recently
afflicting markets in the UK and Italy.

The gilt market will start the week in a nervous mood, with many fearing
base rates will be increased today or tomorrow.
The Bank of England's acceptance of Treasury bills at discounts of up to
5.75 per cent on Friday was seen by some as a sign that base rates,
currently 5.25 per cent, were set to rise. However, the Bank also lent money
on Friday at existing rates, traditionally a signal that base rates will be
unchanged. The result was widespread confusion in the market.
The Bank, which is now in charge of interest rate timing, could take the
opportunity of Tuesday's inflation report publication to make its move.
In the absence of a rate change, the markets will have a few economic
statistics to assess. Today sees the publication of data on M0, the narrow
money indicator which has been worrying Mr Eddie George, governor of the
Bank of England. Analysts think Mr George will get some good news, with the
annual rate falling to 6.3 per cent in July, from 6.9 per cent in June.
Industrial production and manufacturing output figures, due Friday, will
provide further evidence of the strength of the economy. Very strong numbers
will heighten fears in the gilt market of inflationary pressures, as did
last week's Confederation of British Industry survey and the Purchasing
Managers Index.

Economic data in the coming days is likely to set the tone for the next
meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee on August 16.
Recent data has provided mixed evidence about the pace of US expansion - not
least last Friday's second-quarter gross domestic product figures. The 3.7
per cent growth rate is faster than the long-term sustainable rate: but the
figure was below market expectations and consumer spending growth remained
weak, helping the bond market to its best gain in weeks. The long bond
advanced nearly two points on Friday, to put the yield at under 7.4 per
cent.
Friday's employment numbers will determine whether the market can hold on to
these gains. After 379,000 new jobs in June most economists expect the July
figures to show slower job growth. Expectations range from 150,000 to
375,000. A weak employment report would further reduce fears of Fed
tightening at its August meeting.
Other data filling out the economic picture this week will be June personal
income growth (expected at about 0.3 per cent); the June National
Association of Purchasing Managers Index (expected to slip to about 57, from
57.5 in May, due to the build-up in inventory) and new home sales (expected
to slow to 700,000 from 738,000 in May).

FT  01 AUG 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FUND LAUNCHES
Two new emerging market funds have been announced in the past few days.
Credit Lyonnais Securities is planning to launch a Dollars 50m fund to
invest in the Indian communications industries. It will be managed by
Schroder Investment Management and will invest mainly in Indian securities
through a domestic fund to be administered by Indbank Merchant Banking
Services.
The other fund is to be launched by Fleming Investment Management to invest
in newly privatised Russian companies. It also has a Dollars 50m target and
will be advised by Brunswick Investment.
POLAND
The government has decided to allow foreign investors to buy shares in all
publicly traded companies without seeking permits from any government
agencies.
The new regulations will come into force within 10 to 14 days.
Under the present regulations, dating from 1991, foreigners wishing to
invest in Polish publicly traded companies in industries considered
strategic had to get special permits from the privatisation ministry.
VIETNAM
Vietnam hopes to grant US, European and Asian banks licences to set up
branches this year, a senior State Bank official is reported as saying.
Vietnam is keen to attract more US investment and develop trade. Bankers in
Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City expected US banks, Bank of America and Citibank,
together with Deutsche Bank, Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank and ING of the
Netherlands as leading candidates.
JORDAN
Barings has come out with a positive report on the financial markets in
Amman, saying that they will benefit from peace with Israel.
Baring also says that Amman shares are currently trading around 17 times
1994 earnings, and at about 13 times if 'distorting factors' are excluded.
Further liberalisation of the financial infrastructure is planned and
Jordan's authorities are committed to encouraging foreign investment, they
add. Baring's analysts are looking for Jordan's economy to grow by 6 per
cent in 1994 and by 7 per cent in 1995.
MOLDOVA
The Moldovan government formally launched its privatisation programme last
week, announcing a nationwide auction to sell shares in 11 state companies
for vouchers distributed last year.
Forty-seven computerised centres throughout Moldova opened to ease the
process of obtaining shares in state companies liable be privatised.
According to the government programme, about 1,600 state companies, or 34
per cent of all state property in Moldova, should be privatised for vouchers
by September 1995.
Vouchers have already been distributed to 90 per cent of Moldovan citizens.
HUNGARY
The country's shares-for-compensation coupon programme should be completed
by the end of 1995, the government announced last week. So far, compensation
coupons with a nominal value of over Ft108bn have been issued to more than
1m people. Of that number, less than Ft40bn has been swapped for shares,
according to the Compensation Office.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Emerging Markets: Status quo could undermine sterling -
Currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The murky events of last Friday in UK money markets have brought sterling to
centre stage on the foreign exchanges as markets wait to see whether UK
interest rates are raised.
The pound rose sharply last Friday on expectations of a monetary tightening
and is vulnerable to a setback, amid thin August trade, if the Bank of
England leaves rates unchanged.
The mood in the markets at the end of last week was that the Bank's
management of monetary policy would come under strenuous criticism this week
if policy was left on hold following confusing interest rate signals.
When the credibility of the Bank's management of monetary policy was last an
issue - after the much criticised cut in base rates last February - the
pound was sold heavily as a result.
Informing the discussion on UK interest rates will be the Bank of England's
inflation report which is released tomorrow. Other UK figures coming out
this week include M0 today and industrial production on Friday.
Elsewhere, attention will focus on the dollar. The two events likely to
determine the fortunes of the US currency are the aftermath of last night's
deadline in the US - Japan trade procurement talks, and Friday's payroll
data.
Nothing changes immediately if, as expected, the trade talks fail to make
the necessary progress. A 60-day period then commences during which time the
US can decide whether or not to implement sanctions.
With erstwhile dollar bears, such as Mr Fred Bergsten, the influential
Washington economist, now beginning to change their tune, the impact is
likely to be more subdued than when the Washington trade talks collapsed in
February.
Mr Bergsten has suggested that no sanctions will be applied against Japan
until September and the yen will lose some of its strength.
In terms of domestic monetary policy, three events this week will shed light
on the state of the economy: the purchasing managers index, released today,
the release on Wednesday of the Tan book for the August FOMC, and Friday's
payroll release.
In Europe the Bundesbank's summer recess will ensure that market focus
remains on Italy. The currency recovered last week after slipping below
L1,110 against the D-Mark.
The key event will be the credibility of prime minister Mr Silvio
Berlusconi's appearance before the Lower House this week.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Emerging Markets: No island trips for Greece's bankers - The
Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As trading volume on the Athens bourse wilts in the summer heat, Greek
brokers are taking off for long weekends on the islands.
Those left behind are the investment bankers, charged with bringing another
40 Greek companies to the market by the end of the year.
The flow of equity issues this year has already exceeded expectations. Since
January, scarcely a week has gone by without a new public offering, or a
capital increase by a company already listed.
The drachma crisis in May - which sent interest rates on government paper
soaring to 27 per cent for a one-month zero coupon bond - failed to curb
investors' enthusiasm for new issues.
Greece saw new issues worth Dr47bn (Dollars 195m) in the first half of the
year, and another Dr117bn in fresh capital was raised by listed companies.
Most of the 21 newcomers have outperformed the market; several are currently
trading at more than 20 per cent above issue price.
The march to market was led by construction companies, looking for funds to
back their bids for lucrative contracts offered under the European Union's
new Ecu16.8bn (Pounds 13.2bn) aid package to Greece for infrastructure
projects.
The ease with which the contractors' offerings were covered encouraged
companies in other sectors to follow suit.
Textile manufacturers and software companies, medical equipment and
cosmetics producers are some of the new entrants. One fishery has joined the
bourse and another is on the waiting-list, reflec-ting Greece's position as
Europe's largest producer of farm-fattened sea bream and sea bass.
In July, Teletypos - a company owned by several local newspaper publishers,
which controls Greece's most successful private television channel - raised
Dr7bn, making it the first Greek media group to be listed. Issues in the
pipeline include Achaia Clauss Wines and Intrasoft, the software subsidiary
of Intracom, the telecoms equipment manufacturer.
Mr Panagis Vourloumis, managing director of Alpha Finance, the investment
banking arm of Alpha Credit Bank, says: 'The motivation is clear. Interest
rates will remain prohibitively high for the foreseeable future, so the
solution is to go public.'
Greek companies keen to grow to international size have noted that several
companies which joined the Athens bourse during its last period of expansion
in 1990-91 are now the country's blue chips and sought after by foreign
institutional investors.
Such companies can now raise sizeable amounts on the bourse to fund their
ambitions abroad. Mechaniki, the construction company linked with Fide of
Italy, carried out a Dr9bn capital increase early this year. Delta Dairy,
the food processor, raised Dr18bn to fund an aggressive expansion drive into
the Balkans. About half the issue was covered by BSN, the French food
manufacturer.
Even Greece's shipping sector, which traditionally eschews the kind of
scrutiny required for a stock market listing, is starting to make its
appearance. Strintzis Lines, a coastal ferry operator which was floated in
May, is one of the most active stocks, currently trading at 17 per cent
above issue price.
Though the capital markets committee, the watchdog for the bourse, set
stringent conditions for Strintzis' entry, other shipping companies were not
discouraged. Another passenger operator, DANE, has been restructured in
order to comply with the regulations for shipping listings.
The spate of new issues, together with a surge of investment from overseas,
triggered record first-half trading volumes. Daily turnover averaged
Dr6.5bn, against Dr2.5bn last year. Market capitalisation totalled Dr2.9bn
at the end of June, equivalent to almost 13 per cent of Greece's gross
domestic product.
However, as the index declined from its January high of 1,194 to 845 at the
end of last week, volume slipped back to around Dr2.3bn daily. Analysts said
the market was slowing down for the August holiday season and was unlikely
to revive until the next wave of flotations, due in September.
Demand is not expected to shrink, as Greece is still cheap. The Athens
market is valued at 14 times prospective earnings and the new issues are for
the most part modestly priced.
Investors' confidence will be seriously tested towards the end of the year.
Then, the socialist government, now converted to partial privatisation of
large state enterprises, plans to float minority stakes in both OTE, the
Greek telecoms monopoly, and DEP, the holding company for state-owned
refineries and petrol stations.
The government's advisers say that only a small equity tranche in OTE, no
more than Dr100bn, will be sold to domestic investors. The remainder of the
Dr250bn offering is to be placed with institutional investors abroad.
Another question mark hangs over the future of Greece's mutual funds, hard
hit by the government's decision in April to tax interest earned on their
holdings of Treasury bills at 15 per cent. Government paper remains tax-free
to other investors. After two years of explosive growth, the funds are now
stagnating, though there is no sign of a flight by investors: total assets
remain steady at around Dr1,500bn.
Mr Spyros Kriticopoulos, investment director at Alico Eurobank, which
manages a group of mutual funds, said: 'It's a wait-and-see situation
because the finance ministry still hasn't informed us how it proposes to
implement this new tax. But we're worried.'

FT  01 AUG 94 / The Markets: Testing time for coffee and metals -
Commodities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading commodity markets enter this week with some serious question marks
hanging over them.
After the recent fireworks, coffee prices have been settling back and
traders will be looking for signs of consolidation to stave off a feared
major sell-off by the US investment funds whose buying was so influential in
the gains of the past month or so.
At the London Metal Exchange meanwhile, the copper and aluminium markets
will be watched with interest, not to say anxiety, following recent retreats
from long-time highs.
Now that the Brazilian industry and commerce ministry has issued its
assessment of the damage done to the country's coffee crop by the frosts of
June 27 and July 11, and with fears of further frosts in growing areas
receding, the coffee market has to prove that it can thrive in the rarefied
atmosphere above Dollars 3,000 a tonne.
So far the retreat from last month's Dollars 4,000-plus highs has not
threated to carry the London Commodity Exchange September futures position
below the Dollars 3,076 a tonne ruling immediately before the second frost -
last week's low was Dollars 3,362. But with the Brazilian coffee frost
season now entering its final month, speculators, while remaining reluctant
to go 'short' in this market, could be looking for opportunities to take
profits.
The LME copper and aluminium markets are in a comparable position.
Copper last week continued its retreat from the previous week's two-year
highs, while aluminium, having broken through support at Dollars 1,500 a
tonne for three months delivery, dipped below Dollars 1,450 at one point.
Both markets steadied towards the end of the week, however, and they remain
within reach of the highs.
Analysts are for the most part cautiously bullish about the price prospects
for these metals once the current consolidation phase is completed. But, as
in the coffee market, the potential weight of investment fund selling is
seen as a serious threat in the short term.

FT  01 AUG 94 / The Markets: Japan attracts the dollars - Global Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
For once, US equity investors seem to have got their timing at least partly
right on Japan. In a report last week, the US Securities Industry
Associa-tion put purchases of Japanese shares by American invest-ors at a
net Dollars 9.5bn in the first three months of this year - nearly double the
last quarterly record, struck in the opening period of 1991.
Remember the end of the 1980s, when foreigners stayed away in droves and
missed out on the last leg of the great Japanese bull market? (It's not much
consolation to say that the warnings of an asset-price bubble turned out to
be right in the end.) And then there was 1991, when outsiders tried
(unsuccess-fully) to call the bottom for the Nikkei.
This time around, dollar-based investors have been rewarded with some
instant paper gains. Thanks to the US currency's slide, the Japanese market
showed returns of 17 per cent in the first quarter in dollar terms, and
about 6 per cent in the second (having recorded a 24 per cent gain during
1993 at a time when US stocks were up only 7 per cent.)
There is an irony - as well as a warning - in this. Part of the reason for
the dollar's weakness in the first place has been the country's huge capital
outflows. Last year, a Dollars 40bn outflow combined with a Dollars 110bn
current account deficit to leave the dollar severely weakened.
This year, the jump in US portfolio investment in Japan has helped explain
the dollar's dip below 100 yen. It is also noteworthy that Japanese
investors actually sold Dollars 3.5bn of US securities in the first quarter,
the first time for three years that they had been net sellers - and this
despite the fact that the yield gap between long-dated US and Japanese bonds
widened during the period.
The dollar's bounce back to 100 yen could herald a sea-change. The
fundamentals of the Japanese market may still look great to a US investor,
but it remains the case that Japanese industry has yet to produce the
rebound its fans have been predicting. The currency gains which have bailed
out US investors this far seem unlikely to continue.
Slowing capital flows from the US could, in their turn, weaken the yen
against the dollar, further reducing portfolio investment from the US.
The latest stirrings of a trade war with Japan could help the cause by
keeping the dollar under pressure. But sooner or later, those pension fund
managers in the mid West will have to stop speculating on currencies and
start earning returns from their investments in Japanese shares.
Gold
It is now precisely a year since the gold market (with a little help from Mr
George Soros) worked itself into a fever over another bout of world
inflation. The price of the metal jumped to over Dollars 400 an ounce in the
opening days of August a year ago as Europe's currency system threatened to
fall apart.
The gold bulls had their day, only to see the market sink back towards
Dollars 340 an ounce by the end of the summer as the crisis passed. But the
accelerating US economy and sustained interest from the investment community
 -something which, before last year, had not been seen for a decade - have
had their effect since then.
Despite a bout of US interest rate rises, and a widespread view that the
dollar will (finally) rebound, the gold price stands at nearly Dollars 390
an ounce, close to the top of the range in which it has traded for most of
this year.
If the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee opts not to raise interest
rates again at its meeting on August 16 (and the bond market clearly feels
confident, given the two-point jump in long-dated US bonds on Friday), then
the gold price seems likely at least to hold its own.
Mr Wayne Angell, the hawkish former governor of the Federal Reserve, is one
of those who claims a close correlation between the precious metal and
future inflation: to be precise, 83 per cent of the changes in the US
inflation rate are foreshadowed by a move in the gold price, he says (the
view is not shared by many gold market analysts, who these days tend
increasingly to view the metal as just another commodity, rather than the be
all and end all of monetary policy).
According to Mr Angell, the current gold price points to US inflation next
year of 3.5 per cent or more. For a stable price environment, the Federal
Reserve would have to target a price of Dollars 220 an ounce, he adds.
Barometer
The Fed chairman himself pinpointed gold earlier this year as one of the
inflation barometers he intended to watch carefully. But in his most recent
testimony to Congress a fortnight ago, Mr Greenspan showed little interest
in the commodity.
There are some big swing factors in the supply/demand equation which makes
up the gold price: whether any central banks decide to liquidate part of its
holdings to meet a passing fiscal emergency, for instance. But leaving these
aside, the market seems likely to keep bouncing against the Dollars 390
ceiling. Whether it can find a new excuse to leap back past Dollars 400 is
quite another matter.

FT  01 AUG 94 / The Markets: Why shock therapy? - Economic Eye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only one of the predictions that made Marxism the secular religion of the
20th century has proved true. This was the proposition that socialism would
lead to the withering away of the state. So indeed it has, not by its
success, but by its failure.
The collapse of the state is a strong argument for what is called 'shock
therapy', but might be better labelled 'big-bang' reform. In an illuminating
recent paper, Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University, justifies this approach
by pointing to the three interrelated economic crises that confront
post-communist countries: state bankruptcy, systemic collapse and structural
transformation.* The first shows itself in default and inflation, the second
in the disintegration of state economic control and the third in the
shrinkage of the hypertrophied heavy-industrial sector.
'The aim of shock therapy,' argues Prof Sachs, 'is to address these three
crises via the rapid introduction of the core institutions of capitalism.'
These are private property; a stable, convertible currency; freedom for
trade and international investment; corporate control of large enterprises;
and a social safety net.
In a paper written jointly with Alan Gelb of the World Bank, Leszek
Balcerowicz, architect of the Polish reforms, argues that the necessary
policies embrace stabilisation, liberalisation and institutional
restructuring.** It is the first two that can be done quickly and need also
to be done together, because they are complementary. Without price
liberalisation, the need to go on subsidising undermines stabilisation.
Similarly, only after stabilisation will people be subject to hard budget
constraints and have to respond to market signals.
A fundamental reason for speed is that the initial conditions are simply
unsustainable. Almost always among those conditions is a collapsed state.
Just as in the world of physics every action creates an equal and opposite
reaction, so in the world of politics communist tyranny leads to anarchy.
Its downfall creates something akin to Thomas Hobbes' state of nature, in
which life is 'poor, nasty, brutish, and short'.
The fiscal aspects of Moscow's rake's progress are shown in the chart. Prof
Sachs, in another paper, points to five elements of this vicious downward
spiral: people refusing to pay taxes because nobody else does; regions
failing to transfer revenue to the centre because the government loses the
ability to punish them; cancerous criminality, because the probability of
capture declines as the number of criminals rises; default, as foreign
creditors refuse to advance new loans, because none of the others do; and
flight from money, as people refuse to hold the currency, because nobody
else is willing to do so.***
What is important about these five cases is that they all involve contagion.
What is needed then is to deliver a big jolt to self-justifying pessimism.
The jolt is provided by a package which includes exchange-rate stabilisation
and non-inflationary foreign finance of essential budgetary expenditures.
With exchange-rate stability and high domestic interest rates, there will be
flight back to the currency. Similarly, with inflation down and the state
financed, structural reform can proceed and legal private business expand.
Every successful stabilisation of a collapsed, hyperinflationary economy was
preceded by rampant pessimism and followed by an equally unjustifed belief
that the special characteristics of the countries concerned made success
inevitable. Five years ago many argued that shock stabilisations elsewhere
contained no lessons for the very different problems of post-communist
countries. Many also feared that the Poles were about to starve.
These positions, though wrong, did hold a certain plausibility. But the
evidence is now in. We know from experience that big-bang reform is
costless, when comparison is made, not with some utopian ideal, but with the
available alternatives, which are either to do nothing or to have
higgledy-piggledy reform.
What does it mean to say it is costless? It means that the decline in
measured output (which grossly exaggerates the true decline in output, let
alone in welfare) has actually been smaller in countries that have reformed
quickly than in those that have not. Between 1989 and 1993, the cumulative
decline in Poland's gross domestic product was 12 per cent, while the
economy started growing in 1992. In Hungary the cumulative decline has been
16 per cent. In Bulgaria and Romania it has been 26 and 29 per cent,
respectively. But in utterly unreformed Ukraine, GDP declined by 32 per cent
in 1992 and 1993 alone.
Expectations can be turned around and reforms successfully started even
amidst the ruins left by communism. The only questions are why so many
continue to deny this; and also why western governments and institutions
have failed to provide Russia in particular, much the most significant
single case, with the forms and levels of assistance needed to make shock
therapy work there too.

FT  01 AUG 94 / International Company News: Third group enters bid talks
with Lac Minerals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Two mid-sized Canadian gold producers have expressed an interest in jointly
acquiring and then splitting up Lac Minerals, the gold and base-metals group
which is the target of two competing takeover bids worth more than CDollars
2bn (Dollars 1.40bn).
TVX Gold and Kinross Gold, both based in Toronto, have yet to make a formal
offer for Lac. Their overtures have so far been rejected by Lac's
management.
TVX and Kinross said their talks with Lac involved an offer of about
CDollars 15 per Lac share, or a total of CDollars 2.2bn. This is slightly
higher than bids on the table from American Barrick and Royal Oak Mines of
Vancouver.
Under the proposal, Kinross would take over Lac's Canadian mines while TVX
would get its US and Chilean properties.
TVX, which was until recently controlled by Inco, the nickel producer,
operates a number of gold mines in Latin America.
Kinross is a relatively new company which has grown through a series of
mergers and acquisitions involving mines in North America and Zimbabwe.
Lac has so far said that its first choice is to remain independent. But with
its shares widely dispersed, this outcome becomes less likely as the list of
bidders grows.
For the time being, American Barrick, the gold producer controlled by
Canadian entrepreneur Mr Peter Munk remains the investment community's front
runner. More bidders could emerge over the next few weeks.
Royal Oak, headed by Ms Peggy Witte, president, is about one-third the size
of Lac in terms of annual gold output.

FT  01 AUG 94 / International Company News: BASF postpones investment in
Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BASF, the German chemicals group, has postponed investment in Italy because
of the government-inspired price cuts and healthcare reforms.
The move follows the decision last month by Menarini, Italy's largest
domestic drugs company, to transfer all production out of Italy because of
the government's aggressive attitude to the pharmaceuticals industry.
Mr Giovanni Pinamonti, BASF's Italian managing director, explained to the
Financial Times newsletter, Pharmaceutical Business News: 'There is no
(state) industrial strategy (in Italy) for the development of the
pharmaceutical industry.'
BASF has decided for the moment not to carry on with plans to concentrate
worldwide gastrointestinal research in Milan, nor increase its Italian
manufacturing capacity, said Mr Pinamonti.
European drugs companies are bracing themselves for another blow to the
troubled Italian drugs market. Last week the Italian cabinet agreed a 10 per
cent price cut for next year, although the decision has yet to be approved
by Parliament.
Mr Raffaele Costa, health minister, said: 'If it was up to me I would cut
prices even further.'
Ciba, the Swiss group, has admitted it lost L41.7bn (Dollars 26m) last year
in Italy, partly because of the devaluation of the lira, partly because of
investment, and partly because of healthcare reform.
Among the domestic groups, Brokers James Capel estimate Menarini and Sigma
Tau would be hit hardest by any additional price cut. Respectively, about 37
per cent and 41 per cent of their sales are in Italy. Among the
multinational groups Ares-Serono of Switzerland and Pharmacia, the Swedish
group, would be most affected.
Healthcare reforms introduced in January have had a large effect on the
Italian sector.
Growth in all leading European drugs markets has slowed so far this year,
but the Italian market has been the worst hit in Europe.
Year-on-year sales during the first five months have fallen 7 per cent to
Dollars 3.08bn from Dollars 3.59bn. That compares with Dollars 4.7bn for the
same period in 1992, according to IMS International, the specialist market
research group.

FT  01 AUG 94 / International Company News: Mercedes plans development
centre for emission-free trucks - Studies suggest demand for non-polluting
vans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mercedes-Benz is to set up a development centre for emission-free commercial
vehicles at its Mannheim plant next year. Studies suggested that west
European demand for non-polluting vans and other vehicles would be strong
enough to justify industrial-scale production by the end of the century, the
company said yesterday.
Its new urban distribution vehicles, the T1N and TO, were suitable for a
direct entry into this new market, it said. They could first be fitted with
electric motors and with other emission-free motors when the technology had
been perfected.
The announcement followed confirmation last week that Mercedes is to take
over the bus-making activities of the private Kassbohrer group on
undisclosed terms.
The centre would ensure the future of the Mannheim plant, Mercedes said at
the end of negotiations with employees concerned that the Kassbohrer deal
would lead to heavy job losses. No details were available yesterday of any
payroll cuts but restructuring of Mercedes' loss-making bus operations is
certain to follow the takeover.
The company recently announced plans to spin off its European bus divisions
next January into a separate company including German operations, currently
focused on Mannheim, and at a separate company in Turkey.
Kassbohrer's factories in Ulm, Neu-Ulm and Ligny, France, will be rolled
into the new operation, provisionally named Eurobus.
Mercedes said it expected a marked reduction in development and testing
costs, economies from the use of higher volumes of common components and
increased capacity utilisation.
Analysts said the deal would improve Mercedes' presence in the touring bus
market - Kassbohrer's main business - and markets such as Denmark, Spain and
Austria.
While the takeover settles a long turbulent debate over the future of
Kassbohrer, it marks a decisive step in the overdue restructuring of the
German bus industry.
Sales in Germany are expected to fall 10 per cent to 15 per cent this year,
while the total west European market has been stagnant with about 20,000 new
registrations annually for the past 10 years.
According to Mercedes, its Mannheim works made 3,200 complete buses and 560
chassis last year, turning over DM2bn (Dollars 1.25bn) with a workforce of
5,400 people.
In the Turkish operation, where 2,000 employees built 1,200 units, sales
reached DM350m. The Kassbohrer factories turned out 2,300 buses with sales
of more than DM1bn.

FT  01 AUG 94 / International Company News: Iveco sees break-even in 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Iveco, the commercial vehicles subsidiary of Fiat of Italy, expects to break
even in 1994 following the heaviest loss in its history last year.
The group, the second largest truck maker in Europe, plunged to a group net
loss of Fl 592.4m (Dollars 335m) last year from a loss of Fl 258.2m a year
earlier.
Iveco has suffered losses for the past three years in succession totalling
Fl 1.15bn in the face of the prolonged recession in the west European truck
industry.
Truck sales in Europe have fallen for four consecutive years from a peak in
1989, but there are growing signs that the market is emerging from recession
this year with sales rising in some large markets such as the UK and France.
Iveco said its sales volume rose by 25 per cent in the first quarter this
year to 24,552 units from 19,594 in the corresponding period a year ago.
Last year, the group's commercial vehicle sales fell by 21.3 per cent to
90,830, the lowest level for nine years, from 115,433 a year earlier and a
peak of 136,088 in 1989. Group turnover fell by 25.6 per cent to Fl 8.4bn.
Successive heavy losses have forced the company to restructure and Iveco's
total active workforce has been reduced by a third to 30,000 from 45,000
between 1989 and 1993. The number of white collar and managerial staff has
been been reduced by 37 per cent in the same period to 10,000 from 16,000.
Restructuring costs for redundancy and retraining have totalled Fl 560m
since 1989.
Iveco said the era of extraordinary costs was over but it could 'not allow
the financial situation to weaken any further'.
It claimed it had achieved 'a quantum leap' in the efficiency and
productivity of its manufacturing operations. The group had cut its
break-even sales point to 116,000 last year from 131,000 in 1991, and this
was forecast to fall this year to 101,000, the lowest ever.
Iveco spent heavily in the early 1990s renewing its product range and
modernising its plants, but the company claimed 'the years of big spending
designed to develop and to protect the business are behind us'.

<TEXT>
Mobil, the US oil group, plans to take a Dollars 680m charge against
first-quarter earnings to reflect an inventory accounting change, Reuter
reports from Fairfax, Virginia.
The change was in the method of applying the lower of cost or market test
for crude oil and product inventories, the company said. It will push Mobel
into the red for the period.
Mobil said the restatement would result in a loss of Dollars 145m for the
first quarter, against a previously reported profit of Dollars 535m. For the
first six months net profit would be Dollars 53m, or 60 cents a share,
against Dollars 733m, or Dollars 1.77.
Mobil uses last-in, first-out costing to account for the book value of
inventories. In prior years, book value was compared with current market
prices on a worldwide basis when determining the value to be recorded.

Bridgestone, which makes half the tyres sold in Japan and has been hit by
the downturn in the country's vehicle market, yesterday produced its first
interim profits increase since 1990 after a cost-cutting programme.
Although parent company sales fell a further 5.3 per cent to Y288bn (Dollars
2.8bn), pre-tax profits were up 22.9 per cent at Y16.91bn for the six months
to June.
The company expects full-year profits to rise up 26.6 per cent before tax to
Y45bn - improved from an earlier forecast of Y37bn.

Three Polish banks have agreed to work together to establish a 'banking
group' in a first step towards consolidation of the country's fragmented
banking sector.
According to Mr Wojciech Kostrzewa, head of the state-owned Polish
Development Bank (PBR), smallest of the three, the outcome of the agreement
would be 'somewhere between a holding company and a merger'.
The other two banks are Bank Przemyslowo Handlowy of Crakow, which is
shortly to be privatised, and the already listed Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy
(WBK).
WBK was sold by the state last year, with the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development taking a 28.5 per cent stake.
The banks said they were prompted by the potential challenge from foreign
banks - expected once Poland's financial markets are fully opened to
competition.
