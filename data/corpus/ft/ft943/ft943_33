FT  29 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia): Nikkei recovers the 20,000 level
on late buying

Tokyo
Dealers braced themselves for a sharp decline in share prices as the Nikkei
225 average fell through the 20,000 level in the morning session, but the
index closed higher on buying by arbitrageurs and domestic institutions,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
It was finally 110.62 ahead at 20,247.85 after dipping to 19,993.70 in the
morning and setting a day's peak of 20,262.55 just before the close.
Foreign investors took profits on blue chip exporters, while dealers sold to
adjust their positions, pushing the index below 20,000 for the first time
since May 18. Domestic institutions, along with public funds, later
supported the index, restoring investor con-fidence.
Volume, however, remained low at 291.6m shares against 277m. The Topix index
of all first section stocks put on 5.64 at 1,621.46 and the Nikkei 300
firmed 1.52 to 294.33. Falls outnumbered rises by 544 to 428, with 183
issues unchanged.
In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged forward 0.82 to 1,312.70.
Some electrical issues, which met selling in the morning, recovered in the
afternoon. Toshiba, the day's most active stock, rose Y5 to Y727 and Fujitsu
gained Y20 at Y1,040. Others remained weak, Hitachi slipping Y7 to Y952 and
Matsushita Electric Industrial shedding Y30 to Y1,630.
Brokers continued to lose ground: Nomura Securities shed Y30 to Y2,190 and
Daiwa Securities Y40 to Y1,540. Banks, however, were higher on arbitrage
buying, Industrial Bank of Japan appreciating Y20 to Y3,010 and Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank moving up Y50 to Y1,860.
Speculators bought Ihara Chemical Industry, which advanced Y90 to Y1,300 in
spite of the absence of any conspicuous news, while Mitsubishi Oil added Y10
at Y1,160.
Large-capital steels and shipbuilders closed firmer on buying by domestic
institutions. Nippon Steel moved forward Y4 to Y334 and Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries Y4 to Y770.
Mining shares were higher, with Sumitomo Metal Mining ahead Y9 at Y924 and
Dowa Mining gaining Y2 at Y575.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 3.41 to 22,498.81 in volume of 20.4m shares.
The index improved for the first time in six trading days as buying by
domestic institutions countered selling by overseas and individual
investors.
Roundup
An early gain in Hong Kong, lost by the close, supported many of the
region's markets, but turnover was generally low. Local investors in China,
meanwhile, turned nervous.
HONG KONG closed flat after a volatile day as profit-takers erased all of an
earlier 140-point rise.
The Hang Seng index finished just 0.48 ahead at 9,402.66 after touching the
day's high of 9,541.63 in the morning on the strength of property issues.
Strong demand by foreign funds lifted the day's turnover to HKDollars 6.28bn
from HKDollars 4.54bn.
Among property shares, Cheung Kong was up a net 10 cents at HKDollars 37.30
after a day's peak of HKDollars 38.20. Sun Hung Kai Properties advanced 40
cents to HKDollars 49.60.
HSBC Holdings, HKDollars 1.50 higher in early trade, finished unchanged at
HKDollars 91.75.
SHANGHAI's A share index crashed 9.2 per cent to a record low as investors,
resigned to further declines, embarked on a round of selling. The index lost
33.92 at 336.22, for a two-day fall of 13.7 per cent.
The Shanghai exchange was officially launched in December 1990, but the
index did not become a meaningful indicator until much later. Official
newspapers put the previous record low close at 362.46 on November 17, 1992.
The index has plummeted by 79.5 per cent since its high of 1,640.71 was set
on February 16 last year, affected by a national credit clampdown, rising
bank interest rates and the success of this year's government bond issue.
Shanghai's B share index, however, gained as a result of a slight
strengthening in Hong Kong's stock market, putting on 1.4 per cent at 68.39.
In Shenzhen, the A index also closed at an all-time low, falling 5.5 per
cent, but the B index gained 0.4 per cent.
BOMBAY ended slightly firmer after a dull session during which cement and a
few cash issues were the only ones actively traded. The BSE 30-share index
hardened 5.70 to 4,106.97.
Shares in Gujarat Ambuja Cement led the rally in cement stocks, rising by 9
per cent before falling back slightly.
Gujarat Ambuja's shares recorded a year's high when touching Rs720, later
slipping to Rs700, still Rs40 stronger on the day.
TAIPEI eased in a slow trading session as the market continued its period of
consolidation after recent strength.
The weighted index receded 19.21 to 6,642.13 in turnover of TDollars
94.08bn.
Among the most impressive performers, Taiwan Styrene Monomer, a major
petrochemical manufacturer, advanced by the daily 7 per cent limit to
TDollars 87.00.
Brokers said the turnround in the plastics sector would continue to support
prices in the near term because international demand for petrochemicals was
still high.
MANILA was another market to move only marginally higher as investors were
encouraged by gains elsewhere in the region.
The composite index was ahead 6.54 points at 2,791.14 after an intraday high
of 2,813. Turnover came to 1.2bn pesos.
San Miguel, which reported a 40 per cent increase in its first-half net
profits, slipped on profit-taking: the 'B' shares lost 1 peso at 134 pesos.
SYDNEY rose in quiet trade, led by gains in blue chips. The All Ordinaries
index firmed 0.4 to 2,042.1. Turnover amounted to ADollars 544.1m.
BHP added 2 cents at ADollars 18.70 and News Corp gained 3 cents at ADollars
8.49.
TNT remained well supported on optimism of a turnround in its European
operations, climbing 9 cents to ADollars 2.69.
KUALA LUMPUR saw strong institutional and retail buying during the afternoon
which took the market higher for the fifth straight day.
The composite index added 6.11 at 1,026.30.
Idris led the day's activity, rising 18 cents to MDollars 4.84 in response
to its plans to buy a 30 per cent stake in Aokam's plywood mill.
Time Engineering and Landmarks gained on news that they will be part of a
consortium which has won the licence for a new electricity plant. Time rose
70 cents to MDollars 8.05 and Landmarks put on 16 cents at MDollars 5.10.
BANGKOK encountered late profit-taking after Wednesday's rally, pulling the
SET index back from its best level to close 3.69 ahead at 1,371.33. Foreign
institutional demand pushed turnover up to Bt11.66bn from the previous
Bt6bn.
SEOUL was lower for the fourth session in a row in the absence of fresh
factors to drive the market. The composite index declined 8.02 to 926.20.
WELLINGTON was led down by Telecom during another day of slow trade.
The NZSE-40 capital index ended 17.97 off at 2,008.95 in turnover of
NZDollars 39m. Telecom retreated 12 cents to NZDollars 4.68.

FT  29 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Mixed fortunes for German,
Swiss drugs groups
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Claims and counterclaims by the pharmaceuticals companies were a feature of
European trading yesterday.
In Germany, Schering dived DM54, or 5.5 per cent, to DM926, and to DM920 in
the after market, on reports that rival companies had made progress on
research into a drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. It was thought
that an alternative medicine would have a significant impact on Schering's
earnings.
In the opposite direction, Ares-Serono, the Swiss pharmaceuticals group,
picked up SFr99, or 16.5 per cent, to SFr700: Mrs Birgit Kulhoff at UBS in
Zurich explained that Ares held the patent for the production process for
beta interferon which Biogen, the American drugs company, had claimed was
superior to Schering's Betaseron anti-multiple sclerosis drug.
FRANKFURT weakened slightly in the official session but made up some of this
lost ground after hours, helped by strength on Wall Street.
The Dax closed off 17.63 at 2,122.81 and in the Ibis moved to 2,134.12.
Turnover amounted to DM6.1bn.
Commerzbank disappointed some investors with its first-half results,
although there was general agreement that it would match 1993 results for
the full year. The shares ended DM9 off at DM335.
Among other banks, Deutsche fell DM6.00 to DM728.50 and Dresdner DM5.50 to
DM386.00. Elsewhere in the financial sector, Allianz was down DM42 at
DM2,425.
James Capel has reiterated its buy recommendation on Deutsche, following its
recent results: 'Given that some further modest reduction in interest rates
is to be expected, and that statistics for German industry's orders, output
and confidence levels are getting better and better, and that hopefully,
disasters on the scale of Metalgesellschaft and Schneider are things of the
past, there is good reason to be optimistic.'
ZURICH was firmer in deriv-atives-driven trade, and the SMI index, in
negative territory for much of the session, picked up towards the close to
finish 14.4 ahead at 2,559.3. Trading volumes were low.
Roche certificates, marked down to their low for the year of SFr5,160 at one
stage, finished SFr10 down on the day at SFr5,290. A SFr100 decline in EMS
to SFr4,000 was attributed to investors reducing the weighting of the stock
in their portfolios.
Nestle posted a SFr11 gain at SFr1,160, pushed up by a technical rebound
following Wednesday's decline.
CS Holding rose SFr6 to SFr565 ahead of first-half results from Credit
Suisse which could come today.
PARIS shrugged off the cut by the Bank of France in the repo rate - which
had been long expected - and the CAC-40 closed a day of only moderate
trading activity 2.26 softer at 2,053.04.
Most of the corporate news was announced after the close of trading. Elf
Aquitaine, off 80 centimes at FFr411.10, said it was to sell an asset
portfolio worth FFr1.1bn to BNP, FFr1 firmer at FFr259, in exchange for new
shares which would lift its stake in the bank to above 4 per cent, from 1.86
per cent at present.
Roussel Uclaf also reported after hours that first-half net income had
gained 44 per cent, the shares slipping FFr2 to FFr571 during the day; while
Peugeot, which said that first-half turnover was up nearly 15 per cent, lost
FFr1 to FFr829.
MILAN staged a technical recovery after the 4.3 per cent fall over the
previous two sessions, but trading remained thin and the mood uncertain as
investors awaited fresh developments on the political front. The Comit index
rose 1.0 to 696.03.
Against the trend, Olivetti was heavily traded for the second consecutive
session, prompting speculation of some shifting of shareholdings between
investors. The shares gained L27 at L2,364 in volume of almost 14m.
Pirelli led the industrials higher, rising L99 to L2,811, with investors
said to be reassessing recent cables contracts. Fiat ordinary shares rose
L110 to L6,790, while the recently neglected preferred shares caught up with
recent rises elsewhere, adding L80 at L4,070.
AMSTERDAM made forward progress although turnover remained low, as has been
the trend in recent sessions. The Aex index rose 0.91 to 405.22.
Among the day's movers, IHC Caland put on Fl 1.30 at Fl 40.20 as the
engineering and dredging group said it had won an order to provide equipment
for the Suez canal.
MADRID was easier but off its lows, helped by the better tone in other
European bourses and in the futures market. The general index gave up 1.64
at 309.54.
BCH shed Pta10 to Pta2,570 after announcing a 26.9 per cent fall in
first-half pre-tax profits.
Argentaria , which posted a 10.1 per cent increase in first-half net
profits, lost Pta60 at Pta5,670.
A Pta110, or 2.2 per cent, fall to Pta4,990 in Banco Santander was
attributed to a decision to allow 47.3m new shares to trade in Madrid from
today.
BRUSSELS finished mixed after recovering from early losses and the Bel-20
index firmed 0.92 to 1,451.44. Solvay was the star performer, adding BFr475,
or 3.2 per cent, at BFr15,350 in response to Wednesday's better than
expected first-half results.

FT  29 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: Gold shares make ground
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
South African shares ended mixed after investors remained net buyers of
gold-related stocks but held back in industrials.
Dealers, however, said that sentiment remained steady after Wednesday's
gains and demand could re-emerge today.
The overall index was 13 ahead at 5,672, the industrial index lost 22 at
6,434 and golds added 21 at 2,167.
Gencor saw most of Wednesday's gain pared, dipping 30 cents to R11.95 as
demand slowed after the announcement of its purchase of Billiton. Anglos
rose R6 to R246 after gaining on Nasdaq, while De Beers firmed 25 cents to
R111.75. Traders said the shares had attracted offshore interest after
recent inactivity.
Pick'n Pay Stores fell 50 cents to R12.50 as the shares remained under
pressure from continued strike action throughout the country.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Futures take fright
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A further sharp fall in sterling futures, on fears of an interest rate
tightening, dominated markets yesterday, writes Philip Gawith.
Volumes were very large, with both the September and December Eurosterling
contracts trading more than 50,000 lots. December settled 13 basis points
down at 93.54, showing that the market is discounting short-term rates of
6.5 per cent by the year-end, compared to 5.25 per cent presently.
Most analysts agree that the market is not reflecting economic fundamentals,
but investors have been scared into selling by the poor sentiment in the
market. The pattern of options activity suggests that many investors sold
against their better judgment.
Activity on the foreign exchanges was fairly subdued, with the lira still
dominating most of the headlines. Worries about the possibility of the
government falling saw the currency drop to an 18-month low of L1,011.50
against the D-Mark before recovering to close in London at L1,005.
A firmer US Treasury bond market, and short-covering ahead of today's
second-quarter GDP figures, and the weekend trade talks with Japan, helped
the dollar rise. Yesterday evening it was trading at Y99.50 and DM1.5885.
The trade weighted sterling index ended slightly firmer at 78.8, from 78.6,
while the D-Mark was fairly steady in Europe. The French franc ignored a cut
in the intervention rate to 5 per cent from 5.10 per cent to close at
FFr3.415 per D-Mark from FFr3.417.
Dealers were mystified by the bearish interest rate sentiment which has seen
the December short sterling contract shed 34 basis points in two days
without any new information to trade off.
Sentiment remained very nervous and the market was awash with rumours. At
various times, a gilt-edged market maker, a merchant bank and a clearing
bank were all rumoured to be in trouble. The market also seemed unable to
shake off the strange tale of the nameless Tory Euro MP alleged, on
Wednesday, to have called for higher interest rates.
No explanation was offered as to why this should have interested the market,
save that it came the day before the monthly monetary meeting between Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the governor of the
Bank of England.
Mr Nick Parsons, treasury economist at CIBC in London, described the short
sterling move as 'wholly out of line with the likely prospect for interest
rates'. He added that only once in the last 18 years had rates been raised
in August, and that was in 1987, just ahead of the stock market crash.
Commenting on the movements in Eurosterling, Mr Richard Phillips, analyst at
brokers GNI, said: 'A lot of people who were sitting on positions perceived
the risk of a rate hike and were forced to liquidate their positions against
their better judgment.'
Two bits of evidence support this conclusion. First, the large volume in the
September contract. Dealers normally trade in the most liquid contract,
currently December. The large volumes in September suggest that people were
liquidating positions, rather than simply trading.
Second, many investors seemed to be buying options to reflect the underlying
positions they had been forced out of. Short sterling options activity was
very heavy, with most at the strike price of 94.50 and 94.75. This suggests
that investors believe the September contract will close considerably higher
than the 94.28 where the contract ended yesterday.
Mr Phillips said a lot of investors had been looking at the Clarke-George
meeting 'for the pre-emptive rate hike that many in the market are now
forecasting'. Trade was fairly brisk as many who sold on Wednesday were
happy to buy back yesterday at lower prices.
The bearish sentiment in the futures market was at odds with developments in
the cash market. After forecasting a shortage of Pounds 1bn, the Bank of
England provided a Pounds 750m round of early assistance at the established
rate of 5 5/32 per cent - Pounds 23m outright, and a Pounds 727m repo
facility.
Mr Philip Shaw, economist at Union Discount, said the combination of an
early round of assistance and the repo implied that the Bank 'was trying to
be helpful'. He said that the message was of 'unchanged rates for the time
being'.
He predicted, though, that with renewed speculation about rates, the Bank's
early morning operations would be watched more closely in the days ahead.
Analysts said the firmer dollar reflected technical rather than fundamental
factors. The US currency was trading at DM1.5890 in the New York afternoon,
more than two pfennigs up from its European low of DM1.5660. It finished the
New York session at Y100.05 and DM1.5915.
Mr Steve Barrow, analyst at Chemical Bank in London, said the market seemed
still to be taking its lead from the bond market. He said the overall
attitude remained bearish, but the short-covering rally suggests some in the
market see a greater risk in the short term of a rally rather than a fall.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Big Gatt 'winners' on the
look-out for backsliding - Having already seen some of the 1992 Blair House
provisions pared back, Australian farmers fear there may be more dissipation
of benefits before the Uruguay Round deal is implemented
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Australia's farm sector has been touted as one of the big winners from the
settlement of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. For many products,
the country is an efficient, low-cost producer. It would, therefore, seem a
natural beneficiary of freer trade.
To hear local farmers talk, however, no one would believe it. They have
already seen some of the 1992 Blair House provisions pared back. Now the
fear is that more dissipation will follow during the long period leading up
to the full implementation of the Uruguay Round settlement.
Potential environmental obligations, which reflect Europe's confined habitat
and are less applicable to Australia's vast expanses, or manipulation of
base levels from which subsidy reductions will be calculated are just some
of the issues cited.
'It's all very nice, what's happened - but now we've got to watch how it's
executed,' says Mr Bob Lawrence, at the New South Wales Farmers'
Association.
Mr Graham Barron, a grain-farmer from Ungarie, is even blunter. 'The spirit
of Gatt should be adopted immediately, yet stocks are being dumped, even
now, by the US and Europe' he alleges. 'The lead-in will be bumpy and we're
not going to get immediate remedies.'
The much-cited headline figure for the benefit of the Gatt agreement to
Australia's farm sector is a ADollars 900m-ADollars 1bn boost to annual
agricultural exports. Set alongside total rural exports, excluding processed
food, of ADollars 9.72bn in 1992/3, this is plainly an impressive number.
It should be treated with some caution, however. The estimate comes from two
separate econometric models, employed by the Australian Bureau of Resource
Economics, a government forecasting agency, and by the Industry Commission,
the statutory authority that advises federal government on assistance to the
private sector.
In both cases, the ADollars 1bn figure applies only when the provisions of
the Uruguay Round are fully implemented - that is, after 2001. Moreover,
while the models differ in their general scope, both look only at the
'marginal' change to exports at current farm prices. They do not attempt to
estimate what the value of additional exports will be at prices ruling in
the year 2002, what new competition might enter the market, and so on.
These caveats aside, the models anticipate that the gains will come from
three sources. First, there will be a reduction in subsidised exports from
the US and European Union. Secondly, there is the promise of improved access
to markets which are protected at present. Thirdly, the requirement that
domestic support funds - that is, government funds which are used to
subsidise farm production and incomes - be cut by a fifth should also help
to address the problem of overproduction. That, at the very least, should
stabilise world prices generally, and could push them higher.
According to the Abare model, all sectors of the Australian farm sector
stand to get some benefit. But the gains will not be spread evenly. In
absolute terms, the biggest winner is the beef industry, where producers can
expect to receive a ADollars 340m annual export boost by the end of the
six-year implementation period. Next comes the wheat industry, which should
see a further ADollars 250m-worth of exports. The dairy industry is forecast
to enjoy a ADollars 125m benefit; coarse grains, ADollars 90m; sugar,
ADollars 40m; rice, ADollars 25m; and sheepmeat, perhaps ADollars 20m.
Not surprisingly, Australian politicians crowed when the deal was finally
struck on December 15. Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, said his country
would benefit from 'enhanced market access and more predictable market
conditions'. Trade officials, meanwhile, sighed with particular relief when
the European Union reaffirmed the Andriessen Assurance, an undertaking given
by the former European Community agriculture commissioner, Mr Frans
Andriessen, that the EC (now known as the EU) would not export subsidised
beef to North Asian markets of considerable value to Australia.
In large part, farmers' representatives agreed: 'Improvements in market
access will deliver considerable gains to farmers,' commented Mr Graham
Blight, president of the National Farmers Federation.
Even on December 15, however, reaction from the farming sector was less than
euphoric, with negotiators expressing concerns over some of the last-minute
additions to the deal.
Mr Philip Eliason, then deputy director of the National Farmers Federation
and closely involved with the Gatt talks, says that haggling over the timing
and starting-dates for adjustments to export subsidies, and the extension of
the period during which the so-called 'peace-clause' could protect
subsidisers from Gatt action, were both big negatives.
'These were elements which will set back the delivery date of benefits to
the Australian farming sector,' he comments.
At farm level, reaction to the Gatt deal has been even more equivocal, and
varies significantly according to the type of agriculture involved. Even
cattle farmers are cautious. Mr Frank Austin, a cattle-producer from
Adelong, who has some 400 breeding cows on a 1,400-hectare property,
acknowledges that his industry will see some real gain from the enhanced
market access but thinks that Australian farmers will have their work cut
out trying to maximise the opportunities.
'I see the agreement as an advantage. It's formalised the Andriessen
Assurance, which was previously only a verbal agreement, and we will get
increased access to the US. I guess the rationalisation of production in
Europe will also reduce the pressure worldwide,' he says.
'But there still needs to be a very serious emphasis on quality in
Australia, and we need to reduce processing costs. We need to address
freight and non-farm costs. We need to look at the international marketplace
and be aware of what we're producing and for whom. We must be far more
targeted.'
Already, he worries that Australian farmers are losing out to their New
Zealand counterparts.
For grain-farmers, like Mr Barron, the agreement is also a plus, but falls
way short of aspirations.
'A few years ago, we had really low commodity prices for nearly all grains,
and most farmers were in a very tight financial situation. Gatt was seen as
a light at the end of the tunnel,' he says.
Since the Blair House accord, however, 'the watering down and delayed start
makes it a step in the right direction, but not a windfall'. Like his
counterparts in the cattle sector, Mr Barron thinks that Australian farmers
will need to concentrate on quality and find ways of reducing non-farm costs
if they are to seize the market openings that Gatt throws up before rival
producers steal a march.
And in farming sectors where the promised export boost is smaller and
current problems still pressing, the gains can seem even more remote.
'The average wool-grower's perception is that there's something there of
value, but it will probably be dissipated before we get to it,' says Mr
Charles Armstrong, a New South Wales sheep-farmer and president of the Wool
Council of Australia, for example.
Mr Eliason thinks that Australian farmers are probably right to be wary.
'While the Uruguay Round improves the unfair trading situation, there's
still the test of fair trading,' he says, noting that countries like
Hungary, East Germany or even the Ukraine could have the potential to become
significant players at some stage in the future.
'Gatt's no panacea - it will just compel competitive forces even further.'

<TEXT>
Australia is set to become the world's biggest raw sugar exporter this year,
with a high sugar content cane crop in Queensland expected to push output
beyond the forecast 4.4m tonnes, reports Reuters from Brisbane.
The state's sugar output is likely to rise to over 4.6m tonnes according to
the Canegrowers group.
Mr Ian Ballantyne, Canegrowers general manager, said that the signs after a
month of harvesting indicated that the record crop of 32m tonnes of cane had
above average sugar content and would beat earlier sugar production
forecasts.
'We have seen around a 10 per cent increase in the actual size of crop but
about 15 per cent increase in the content of sugar,' he said. 'We definitely
have 4.4m tonnes of sugar there but probably more.'
About 85 per cent of Australia's raw sugar is exported with 3.36m tonnes
going overseas last year. This made Australian sugar exports the world's
second largest after Cuba's 3.6m tonnes.
Australia is hoping to take the number one position this year with a third
successive good crop and with Cuba's sugar production falling to about 4m
tonnes.
Last year Queensland produced 4.02m tonnes of sugar with the only other
growing state, New South Wales, producing its annual average of around
200,000 tonnes.
'There is just no question that the 1994 growing season will produce a very
good crop of sugar after a bit of a ragged start,' Mr Ballantyne said.
So far, only about 20 per cent of the country's crop has been harvested.

<TEXT>
Denmark has eased the terms on which oil companies are invited to apply for
licences to explore for hydrocarbons in the Danish sector of the North Sea
in the country's fourth licensing round.
The new terms have been approved the Folketing (Parliament) energy
committee.
Compared with the third licensing round in 1989, they have been altered
significantly: no royalty payment is required; companies will not be
required to apply for low as well as high risk acreage; there will be no
right of first refusal to buy oil and gas by the state oil distribution
company; and no special requirements concerning research, development and
training.
There will be obligatory 20 per cent state participation, but the state oil
company, Dansk Olie og Naturgas, will pay its share of the exploration costs
and there will be no sliding scale allowing the state company to increase
its share if a commercial find is made.
The acreage opened in the fourth round is in the extreme western tip of the
Danish area, adjacent to areas where finds have already been made.
Output from the Danish fields last year reached 9.3m tonnes of crude oil,
plus 4m tonnes oil equivalents of gas, slightly more than Denmark requires
for its own needs.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Aluminium Pechiney said yesterday that it has started work on the financing
of an estimated USDollars 400-Dollars 500m project to modernise the Russian
Krasnoyarsk aluminium plant, reports Reuters from Paris.
Its chairman, Mr Bernard Legrand, said the funds would be used to construct
an initial production line of 250,000 tonnes a year.
Annual output capacity at Krasnoyarsk would eventually be brought back up to
its existing capacity of some 800,000 tonnes, which would require even more
funding, he said.
Aluminium Pechiney will work on the financing project with investment bank
Morgan Grenfell as financial adviser and Bechtel Corp of the US.
Mr Legrand said he had a meeting on Tuesday with Russian prime minister
Victor Chernomyrdin, who confirmed his willingness to proceed quickly with
the first step of the Krasnoyarsk project.
The upgrading of Krasnoyarsk wouldl be followed by modernisation of a second
plant at Bratsk, which also has a current capacity of some 800,000, said Mr
Legrand.
The Krasnoyarsk and Bratsk plants are each now producing about 700,000
tonnes a year.
The modernisation plan is in line with the conclusions of the Canberra
aluminium conference on July 20-21, which stressed the need to integrate
Russian producers into world markets, he said.
Legrand said Pechiney had been invited a year ago by the Russian Committee
on Metallurgy to conduct a study on the modernisation of three Russian
smelting facilities at Krasnoyarsk, Bratsk and Novokuznetsk. Novokuznetsk
has an existing capacity of 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes.
An evaluation committee aproved the Pechiney report last May and selected
Pechiney to work on the modernisation of Bratsk and Krasnoyarsk.
Legrand said he expects work on Krasnoyarsk to start within two years. The
modernisation of Bratsk is expected to follow. Initial output for Bratsk
will also be 250,000 tonnes per year, with capacity eventually rising back
up to 800,000 tonnes.
Legrand said the whole modernisation project for Krasnoyarsk and Bratsk
could take five to 10 years.

FT  29 JUL 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Opening auctions of the new selling season in Australia brought a fresh rise
in wool prices this week, which continued and led to an increase in the
newly based market indicator of 7 cents, to close at 681 cents a kg. This
means an increase compared with the end of June of about 15 cents or 2.5%,
though adjustments make exact comparisons difficult. Wool at other auctions
this week, in New Zealand and of British wool in Bradford, showed a similar
or greater advance. Traders still indicate resistance to higher prices from
the retail end, despite the maintained upward trend and the relatively low
level of wool prices on any long term comparison. Holidays now affect many
of the leading wool processing countries in Europe but otherwise activity is
good.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pechiney aluminium plan wins
Russian government support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pechiney of France has won Russian government support for a scheme to
modernise gradually the Siberian aluminium smelters - Krasnoyarsk, Bratsk
and Novokuznetsk - which between them account for about half of Russia's
aluminium production capacity but are among the world's heaviest polluters.
Mr Bernard Legrand, head of Pechiney's aluminium activities, said that a
start would be made at Krasnoyarsk with a 'module' of 250,000 tonnes of
annual capacity to replace outdated existing tonnage. Arranging finance for
this, an estimated USDollars 400m to Dollars 500m, and completing detailed
engineering studies would take 18 months to two years and construction
another two years.
Then a 250,000-tonne module would be built at Bratsk which, like
Krasnoyarsk, has an annual capacity of 800,000 tonnes. Both are producing
below that rate. He hoped this step-by-step process would continue until
capacity at all three smelters had been modernised.
Mr Legrand said that he was assured at a meeting with the Russian prime
minister, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, that he had the Russian government's
support for the project. 'I am pretty confident things will work out, but it
won't be easy,' he added.
Pechiney will work with Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank, which will have
to find a way to put together a bankable international finance package,
while Bechtel, the US civil engineering group, will do detailed studies to
see that as much Russian equipment as possible is used.
Mr Legrand said Pechiney's involvement sprang from the recent multi-lateral
trade agreement between the big aluminium producing countries when western
governments pledged to offer technological help and finance to the Russian
industry if it would join in the international efforts to cut output
temporarily to bring the aluminium market back into balance.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries make solid gains after rally by
dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A rally by the dollar helped US Treasury bonds post solid gains yesterday
despite initial jitters over an ambiguous economic reading.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  9/16 higher
at 84 23/32 , with the yield slipping to 7.55 per cent. At the short end,
the two-year note was up  1/16 at 99 27/32 , to yield 6.193 per cent.
Bonds across the spectrum came under early pressure after the Labor
Department reported that initial claims for unemployment benefit last week
fell by 59,000 to 331,000, the lowest since March 26.
Analysts, however, attributed the decline to technical factors and
discounted the raw data as an accurate indication of the economy's strength.
The benign interpretation allowed Treasuries to climb back into positive
territory, although the approach of today's preliminary estimate of
second-quarter gross domestic product held bonds in check during the
morning.
Today's report should provide a clue to the timing of the Federal Reserve's
next move to lift short-term interest rates. Economists were predicting
second-quarter growth of 3.9 per cent, up from 3.4 per cent in the first
three months of the year. A reading that exceeds the consensus forecast
could cause prices to tumble.
As traders sought to square their positions ahead of the data, the dollar
staged an impressive afternoon rally in the foreign exchange markets. The
development eased the way for dealers seeking to distribute new two-year and
five-year notes auctioned by the Treasury earlier in the week, bringing a
measure of confidence to the market going into the GDP announcement.
In the absence of significant fundamental news, European government bonds
spent another day drifting sideways on low volume. However, volatility
remained high due to thin market conditions.
Gilts had another roller-coaster session: falling at the opening in the
aftermath of Wednesday's sell-off, recovering on investor buying and easing
back in late trade on worries about a rise in UK interest rates. The
September long gilt futures contract closed at 101 9/32 , up  5/32 on the
day.
Continuing worries about the possibility of an imminent rate increase, which
pushed three-month rates to their year's high yesterday, continued to weigh
on the market.
'Most people have been expecting rates to rise eventually, but now there's
increasing talk that we'll see a pre-emptive rate hike sooner than
expected,' said a senior gilt trader.
Nervousness ahead of today's second-quarter US GDP data also overhung the
market. 'Going into the data, people aren't willing to take any sizeable
positions either way,' said Mr Ifty Islam of Merrill Lynch.
Still, traders reported some investor buying of medium and long-dated stock,
which helped gilts recoup their losses during the day. Switching into gilts
from neighbouring markets was also reported, helping gilts' 10-year yield
spread over bunds to narrow to around 183 basis points from Wednesday's high
of 195 basis points.
Trading in the German bond market was technical and futures-driven, with
retail investors said to be sidelined. The late breach of key support levels
on the September bund future gave scope for further falls in the contract
and, according to Mr Peter Kerger, head of futures and options at NatWest
Markets in Frankfurt, it could test 92.20 in the coming days. However, he
said he does not expect it to revisit its recent low of just below 90.00.
The contract ended at 92.82 on Germany's DTB, down 0.48 points on the day.
French bonds fell in line with bunds, ignoring the Bank of France's widely
expected 10 basis point cut in its intervention rate to 5 per cent. The
September notional bond contract on Matif ended the day at 116.84, down 0.34
points on the day.
Italian bonds took a breather after the recent sell-off, closing only
slightly weaker. However, sentiment remains weak given the fragile political
background, and the market is expected to remain volatile as the corruption
probe continues into Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's holding company
Fininvest.

FT  29 JUL 94 / International Bonds: Seven-year sterling issue for European
Investment Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Investment Bank (EIB) followed up Wednesday's Y50bn three-year
offering yesterday with a Pounds 200m issue of seven-year eurobonds. The
bonds were priced to yield 5 basis points over the 7 per cent UK government
bond due 2001.
Syndicate managers questioned the timing of the issue, in view of
Wednesday's sharp fall in the gilts market. Some reported subdued demand for
the bonds and predicted that they would struggle in secondary market
trading.
However, the EIB and lead manager BZW said the recent fall in the gilt
market had little impact on the issue. Indeed, the EIB said its bonds had
benefited from the better tone in gilts yesterday.
BZW said most of the demand came from continental European retail and
institutional investors, attracted by the current coupon of 8.5 per cent and
the significant discount to par.
The EIB had also taken advantage of the lack of supply in the seven-year
area. 'Because of the low level of swap spreads in the eurosterling market,
there have not been any issues with a seven-year maturity this year,' BZW
said.
The EIB said the funds raised from the issue will be on-lent to projects in
the UK. About 90 per cent of the EIB's sterling borrowings this year have
gone back into the UK.
Ontario Hydro tapped the short end of the Canadian dollar curve, raising
CDollars 350m through an offering of two-year eurobonds. The pricing of the
bonds, to yield 20 basis points over two-year Canadian government bonds, was
seen to be fair, although some syndicate managers thought the issue was too
large given its orientation towards retail investors.
Joint lead manager Nomura said the wide differential between yields on
Japanese and Canadian government bonds and the view that the yen was close
to its peak made these bonds attractive to Japanese investors.
Two-year Canadian government bonds currently yield around 8 1/4 per cent,
compared with around 2.60 per cent on Japanese government bonds with the
same maturity.
Nomura reported a strong take-up from its regional offices while
ScotiaMcLeod, the other joint lead, expected the balance to be placed in
Europe over time. Soon after the bonds were freed to trade, the spread
widened out to around 23 basis points.
Elsewhere, Morocco is believed to have asked several investment banks,
including Paribas, Salomon Brothers and two other US houses, for advice
about a possible return to the international bond markets following the
rescheduling of its foreign debt last year.
The country is thought to be interested in raising between Dollars 100m and
Dollars 200m through a eurobond or a Yankee bond issue, or failing that, by
means of a private placement. The maximum maturity would be five years,
although three years was more likely to appeal to investors.
Bankers said Morocco's debt had traded well since the restructuring and
investors with holdings of emerging market debt were keen to diversify away
from Latin American paper, but the difficult conditions in the international
bond markets and the volatile situation in Algeria could hamper Morocco's
return. A further disadvantage was that Morocco did not have a credit
rating, although it might well seek one in the near future.

Dollars 50m
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Vietnam Frontier Fund, the latest investment fund aimed at the fast-growing
economies of Indochina, has received commitments for Dollars 50m. The fund's
managers had initially hoped to raise as much as Dollars 100m.
There are four investment funds operating in Vietnam, and all are listed in
Dublin, mostly for tax reasons. The other three funds have raised some
Dollars 170m.
Finding viable investments in Vietnam has proved difficult and slow for all
four funds. Only Dollars 25m of the Dollars 50m in commitments to the
Vietnam Frontier Fund has actually been paid in, with the remainder on call
from the investors.
The new fund plans to take a particularly active role in creating and
managing the companies and projects in which it buys a stake, and would be
able to provide them with credit.
'Because issues such as training and control are critical to successful
investment in Vietnam today, the managers of the fund will second staff as
required to ensure that its investments are property nurtured,' the fund
said.
By providing stand-by letters of credit for new projects, the fund said it
'hopes to be able to provide one of the missing elements in the current
Vietnamese investment environment'.
The fund said it would open offices in the capital Hanoi and in Ho Chi Minh
City, the southern commercial centre that includes Saigon, and would look at
investments in real estate development, natural resources, banking and
financial services, tourism, infrastructure and industry.
Finansa Thai, a Bangkok-based merchant bank group, owns 70 per cent of the
fund's management company. Stockbroker HG Asia has 20 per cent and N. X.
Oanh Associates of Vietnam 10 per cent.
Mr Eugene Davis, fund president, said: 'We plan to commit our first
investment for the fund within the next month.'

After-tax charges of Dollars 451m, more than half of them due to an
explosion at a chemical plant in Ohio, pushed Shell Oil, the US arm of the
Royal Dutch/Shell group, into loss in the second three months of the year.
Its chemicals operations were hit by charges of Dollars 233m, stemming from
litigation, property losses, and damage claims arising from the explosion,
as well as the write-off of assets and the sale of a subsidiary. Three
employees died in the accident at the plant in Belpre, Ohio.
These costs more than wiped out a Dollars 85m profit - up from Dollars 30m
last time - in the business during the quarter.
Shell Oil also took a Dollars 154m charge on its non-operating activities.
This related mainly to a write-down of a coal investment, to what it called
'approximate published estimates of market value'.
It also reported a Dollars 66m charge on undeveloped properties in Alaska
and non-producing oil properties in California. The level of oil prices, and
the failure of other companies which had drilled in the same area made
future production 'highly unlikely', the company said.
Hit by these costs, Shell Oil reported an after-tax loss of Dollars 194m,
compared with a profit of Dollars 203m in the second quarter of 1993.
Leaving aside the effect of one-off items, the company said it would have
reported earnings of Dollars 257m, up 20 per cent from a year before.

Newcrest Mining, the group formed when the gold-mining subsidiaries of
Broken Hill Proprietary and Newmont Mining merged their Australian
operations, has reported after-tax profits of ADollars 23.8m (USDollars
17.6m) for the six months to June, a 25.3 per cent increase over the same
period a year earlier. Sales were ADollars 212.2m, compared with ADollars
217m in the first half last year.
Newcrest said that gold sales totalled 183,241 ounces, up from 171,838
ounces last time, at an average realised price of ADollars 605 per ounce.
The cost of sales was ADollars 374 per ounce, compared with ADollars 364
previously. Group equity production was 173,419 ounces, up from 167,229
ounces.
The company said that production costs in the second quarter to end-June had
been adversely affected by a write-off of deferred costs associated with its
Pernatty pit at the New Celebration gold project in Western Australia.
All costs related to Newcrest's unsuccessful legal action over the sale of
stake held by one of its joint venture partners in the Boddington gold mine
were also accounted for during this quarter.
Pasminco, the Australian lead and zinc producer, is to spend ADollars 45m at
its Rosebery mine in Tasmania in an effort to develop ore bodies below the
current mine working levels.
The company said the four-year project would aim at the development of an
additional 10m tonnes of ore reserves.

San Miguel, the Philippines' largest manufacturing enterprise, has announced
a 40 per cent rise in first-half net profits to 2.23bn pesos (Dollars 55m),
on consolidated net sales 13 per cent higher at 32.9bn pesos, writes Jose
Galang in Manila.
Earnings per share advanced to 1.56 pesos from 1.12 pesos previously.
The company said higher sales volume, which reflected the accelerated
economic growth during the period, accounted for the robust financial
results.
San Miguel's brisk profit increase in the first half did not include any
extraordinary income. The company in April sold the present site of its Hong
Kong brewery, and the windfall gain from the sale will be booked in
September, when full payment for the property will be made.
The sale is estimated to result in a non-recurring income of HKDollars
2.93bn (USDollars 379m) for San Miguel Brewery Hong Kong.

Kirin Brewery, Japan's largest beer and beverage company, said brisk demand
for Budweiser beer, sold under licence from Anheuser-Busch of the US, helped
sales and profits for the first half to June.
The company said effects of price discounting of beer by leading supermarket
chains and increased competition from cheap imported brands had yet to show
up in its interim profit figures. Pre-tax profits for the six months to June
rose 4 per cent to Y35.9bn (Dollars 366m), on a 1.9 per cent increase in
sales to Y628.4bn.
After-tax profits climbed 19 per cent to Y17.3bn on a fall in special losses
from property sales.
For the full year to December, Kirin expects a 13.1 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits to Y87bn on a 6.2 per cent increase in sales to Y1,430bn.

<TEXT>
Sumitomo Chemical of Japan has substantially reduced its first-half losses
as a result of cost savings, cheaper raw materials and a lower interest
bill, but has not yet decided whether to reinstate its dividend.
The pre-tax loss for the six months to June was down to Y402m (Dollars 4.1m)
from Y2.93bn, in spite of a 4.2 per cent dip in sales to Y273.84bn. It said
yesterday that sales of basic chemicals were down 1.7 per cent and fine
chemicals 2.7 per cent, with a sharper fall of 8 per cent in petrochemicals
and plastics. Agrichemicals showed the smallest decline, of 0.5 per cent,
amid demand for feed additives.
Exports grew 1.6 per cent overall, to Y38.81bn. The company has also been
expanding its overseas interests, with projects in Singapore and the US.
Net losses were down to Y1.94bn from Y5.44bn, and it expects to reach
break-even for the full year, on sales down 1 per cent to Y540bn. It is
paying no interim dividend and indicated that the 1994 payout could be
anything between nil and Y3 a share.

FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: Mitsubishi may rescue trust bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mitsubishi Bank, one of Japan's largest commercial banks, is considering
measures to rescue Nippon Trust Bank, according to industry sources. The
proposals under consideration are thought to include a takeover of the
troubled trust bank.
Mitsubishi currently owns 5 per cent of Nippon Trust, the maximum permitted
by law, but in the last few years it has strengthened its links and last
year installed one of its senior managing directors, Mr Tomoaki Hirano, as
Nippon Trust's president.
Nippon Trust is the smallest and weakest of the country's seven trust banks.
The collapse of the Japanese property market in recent years has left it
with a bad debt mountain. In the year to March its disclosed non-performing
loans rose by 79 per cent, to Y131bn (Dollars 1.3bn), the largest increase
among all Japan's leading banks.
However, this figure does not include restructured loans, on which interest
has been cut sharply to keep borrowers afloat. Analysts estimate the actual
total of non-performing loans could be closer to Y190bn, more than 10 per
cent of Nippon Trust's loan book. These non-performing assets represent 90
per cent of the trust bank's tier one capital.
Worse still, unlike most Japanese banks it is unable to cover its potential
loan losses by sales of equity holdings. Mr David Threadgold, banking
analyst at BZW in Tokyo, estimates that the bank may have as little as Y30bn
in such hidden equity gains, well short of its bad debt total. 'Without
outside intervention, Nippon Trust has no obvious way to free itself from
its overwhelming problem loans,' said Mr Threadgold.
By contrast Mitsubishi Bank is one of the strongest of the country's 11
'city' (commercial) banks. It has estimated problem loans of just 3.6 per
cent of total loans.
Officials at Mitsubishi Bank and Nippon Trust yesterday denied that takeover
plans had been agreed. However, industry sources said that Nippon Trust
needed at least Y100bn in financial support.
A takeover by Mitsubishi Bank would present a conundrum for the regulators,
since it could breach ministry of finance (MoF) rules on the ownership of
trust banks. Last year the MoF for the first time allowed city banks to
establish trust bank subsidiaries. But the new rules prevent city banks from
operating some of the most profitable elements of trust banking business,
such as pension funds and loan trusts. The rules are designed to protect
trust banks' key activities from incursions by the larger banks.
If the MoF refused to allow Mitsubishi Bank to run the full range of trust
banking activities, the merger would lose its appeal for the city bank,
which might also then be reluctant to keep the bank afloat with loans.
However, if the MoF allowed a full merger, other trust banks could be
expected to object.
The MoF would not comment yesterday, but if it is presented with a merger
plan, analysts were agreed that it would probably approve it. 'Faced with
the unattractive alternative of allowing a bank to fail,' said Mr Mark
Faulkner, banking analyst at SG Warburg, 'the MoF will almost certainly
prefer to allow a merger'.

FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: Wheelock posts 50% gain after
big exceptional sales

<TEXT>
Wheelock, the Hong Kong holding company for the late Sir YK Pao's listed
corporate empire, yesterday announced a 50 per cent rise in profits,
totalling HKDollars 2.2bn (USDollars 286m) after tax and minority interests,
for the year to March 31. Until last November it was known as World
International.
Profits, which grew from HKDollars 1.47bn, were boosted by two exceptional
items totalling HKDollars 271.6m. The bulk of this accrued from the sale of
two properties, while HKDollars 113.4m worth came from the sale of long-term
investments.
Wharf Holdings, Wheelock's 44 per cent owned associate whose interests span
property, infrastructure and hotels, remained the driving force, accounting
for around 70 per cent of profits. Wheelock hopes to reduce this domination
as earnings from Wheelock Property and its joint ventures come on stream.
In the past eight months Wheelock Pacific, the vehicle for the new
businesses, has concluded joint ventures with Climax International, a Hong
Kong paper company, Virgin Megastores, Maison Mode, NatWest financial
services and Foster's, the Australian brewery group.
The group is to pay a final dividend of 26.5 cents(HK), compared with 21
cents in the previous year. Earnings per share came in at 108.3 cents, up 51
per cent from 71.6 cents.
The consolidated net asset value of the company stood at HKDollars 20.03 per
share at the fiscal year end, an increase of 70 per cent over the 1993
figure of HKDollars 11.76.
Mr Peter Woo, Wheelock chairman, said the company was looking at investment
opportunities of HK10bn-HKDollars 20bn a year, which could be financed by
debt issues and bank financing. The company has a modest
debt-to-shareholders' funds ratio of around 4 per cent.
Retailing contributions were strong, with net profits from the 70 per
cent-owned luxury store operator Lane Crawford increasing 133 per cent to
HKDollars 362.1m, compared with HKDollars 155.1m in the previous year.
However, Realty Development Corporation, Wheelock's 72.4 per cent owned
property company, saw earnings slump 42 per cent, to HKDollars 634.8m from
HKDollars 1.1bn.

<TEXT>
Asahi Glass, Japan's biggest glassmaker, showed a 43.9 per cent slide in
pre-tax profits to Y11.25bn (Dollars 115m) for the first half to June, as
stagnant demand from the construction and automotive industries pulled sales
9.2 per cent lower to Y440bn.
Rationalisation measures introduced during the period, devolving some
centralised responsibilities to its operating divisions, yielded a 7.7 per
cent drop in operating costs to Y436.6bn. The company ex-pects a profits
recovery for the full year.
Sales of glass and construction materials, which represent almost half of
all turnover, were down 7.7 per cent and those of chemicals, the second
largest division, emerged 12.7 per cent lower.
Growth was achieved only in electronics, where turnover was up 2.8 per cent
to Y36.9bn as a result of demand for integrated circuits, glass substrates
and optical fibre.
In spite of the high value of the yen, Asahi Glass managed to expand exports
by 11.7 per cent, reducing its exposure to the dull domestic economy.
Exports account for 14.7 per cent of all sales, up from 12.0 per cent.
A maintained interim dividend of Y4.50 per share is being paid from net
earnings of Y6.44, down from Y9.90.

test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in German drug company Schering fell 5 per cent yesterday following a
50 per cent rise in those of US biotechnology company Biogen as the
likelihood of competition in the fast-growing multiple sclerosis drug market
increased.
Swiss company Ares Serono, which is developing a drug similar to Biogen's,
saw its share price rise by 17 per cent yesterday.
Biogen this week reported preliminary results of final phase trials of its
beta interferon drug which, it claimed, cuts the frequency and scale of
multiple sclerosis attacks over a six-month period.
The company was sufficiently confident to increase production in the US and
marketing in Europe. Full data on the clinical trials would be presented in
October, it said.
Schering sells its own beta interferon product called Betaseron, the only
such product approved by medical regulators for patients. This month, the
company said 1994 sales of Betaseron would reach DM300m (Dollars 190m).
Analysts at Lehman Brothers estimate the market for beta interferon at
Dollars 500m-Dollars 1bn a year by the end of the decade.
The share price rise took Biogen's market capitalisation to about Dollars
1.5bn, the fourth biggest in the biotech sector.
This week, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, the Israeli-based group which has
another multiple sclerosis drug in development, said it was setting up
production facilities in Israel after viewing preliminary data of final
stage trials of its treatment Copaxone.
It expects to file its multiple sclerosis drug for US approval this year or
early 1995.

Australis Media, the fledgling pay-TV company in which TCI, the US cable

announced that it was forming a 50-50 joint venture with Liberty
Sports/Prime International to broadcast a 24-hours-a-day sports channel,
writes Nikki Tait. Liberty is the programming arm of TCI.
The programming deal is the latest in a series of rapid developments at
Australis, as it attempts to bring pay-TV into Australian homes before the
end of 1994. There is still some scepticism about Australis' long-term
chances of success, given the small size of the Australian market for pay-TV
and the presence of some big entrenched media interests, including those of
Mr Rupert Murdoch and Mr Kerry Packer.

American International Group, the US-based insurance group, notched up a
further 14 per cent advance in net income in the second quarter, in spite of
little change in US property/casualty insurance rates during the period.
The improvement came on the back of a 9.3 per cent growth in premiums
compared with a year before, and the absence of catastrophes in the US,
which led to a fall in the group's combined loss ratio to 98.66 from 99.6 a
year before.
AIG reported net income of Dollars 550m on revenues of Dollars 5.6bn,
against Dollars 482m on revenues of Dollars 5bn the year before. Earnings
per share were Dollars 1.74, up from Dollars 1.52.
Mr Maurice Greenberg, chairman, attributed the advance to strong results in
all of the group's businesses.
He said the property/casualty business in the US was helped by the absence
of catastrophes, while premium rates were little changed.
On the general insurance side, pre-tax income rose 14 per cent to Dollars
379m on a 9 per cent rise in premiums, to Dollars 2.9bn. Life insurance
premiums, meanwhile, grew by 16 per cent to Dollars 1.7bn, fuelling a 19 per
cent advance in pre-tax income to Dollars 213m. First-half net income rose 8
per cent to Dollars 1.1bn.

FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: Elf in FFr1.1bn deal with BNP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Elf Aquitaine, the French oil company privatised earlier this year,
yesterday said it would sell FFr1.1bn (Dollars 198m) worth of industrial
investments to Banque Nationale de Paris, its principal bank.
Elf will be paid in BNP shares, which will make the oil group the second
largest investor in the bank with more than 4 per cent of its capital. Elf
holds 1.86 per cent of BNP's shares - taken at BNP's privatisation last
autumn.
A joint statement said the deal reflected Elf's strategy of disposing of
non-core assets and BNP's desire to strengthen its position in venture
capital, where it holds investments worth about FFr15bn. The two companies
are part of each other's noyau dur of long-term stable investors.
Elf will sell the industrial assets held by Financiere Gamma, a subsidiary
of CPIH, which in turn is a joint subsidiary of Elf and Elf Gabon, which
groups the oil company's Gabon interests. The operation is expected to
involve the issue of between 4m and 4.4m BNP shares.
The assets involved are non-listed and most are venture capital investments.
They include Marie Brizard, the liqueur company and France Elevage, the
genetics and agricultural concern. Elf said none of the investments were
strategic and did not include its participation in Bidermann, the troubled
textiles group.
Since taking over as chairman of Elf last year, Mr Philippe Jaffre has
focused on the group's core activities of oil and gas, chemicals and
healthcare.

FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: Transamerica falls 10% from
record earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After-tax profits at Trans-america, the San Francisco-based financial
services group, fell 10 per cent from a record high the year before, a
period when the earnings had been lifted by investment gains, writes Richard
Waters.
Excluding these one-off items, net income on continuing operations, of
Dollars 103m, was up from Dollars 99m the year before on stronger results
from leasing and consumer and commercial lending. Mr Frank Herringer,
president and chief executive, said the company was 'encouraged by signs of
recovery in the Californian economy' and expected 1994 as a whole to be a
good year.
During the latest period, income from real estate tax planning services
dropped to Dollars 16m from Dollars 20m the year before, as the wave of
mortgage refinancings by US homeowners diminished with higher interest
rates.
This decline was more than offset by a rise in income from commercial
lending to Dollars 14m, from Dollars 9m the year before, thanks to lower
credit losses and better lending margins. Leasing income was up Dollars 2m
at Dollars 16m and consumer lending rose Dollars 1m to Dollars 24m.
Reported net income was Dollars 106m, or Dollars 1.34 a share, down from
Dollars 124m, or Dollars 1.49, the year before. First-half net income of
Dollars 209m was down from Dollars 215m last time.

recovery

<TEXT>
Delta and Continental, two leading US airlines, yesterday provided further
evidence of the industry's tentative recovery by posting improved
second-quarter operating results.
Delta, the country's third biggest carrier, announced a 61 per cent surge in
operating income to Dollars 92.3m, excluding a Dollars 413.7m pre-tax charge
related to a restructuring programme announced last April.
The result reflects a 1.5 per cent gain in operating revenues to Dollars
3.18m, and a 4 per cent upturn in operating revenue in terms of available
passenger seats. The higher return more than offset a slight increase in
operating expenses to Dollars 3.09bn.
Net income, excluding the provision, was marginally ahead at Dollars 10.8m,
against Dollars 7.2m in the second three months of 1993. However, the bottom
line was a loss of 33 cents a share, against a deficit of 41 cents in the
year-earlier period.
In spite of the progress, Mr Ronald Allen, Delta's chairman, said the
airline was still a long way from achieving its goal of sustained
profitability.
Meanwhile, Continental, the Texas-based carrier which emerged form its
second bankruptcy in April 1993, narrowed its operating loss to Dollars 1.5m
on revenues of Dollars 1.4bn. The result represents a considerable
improvement on the 1993 quarter, when the airline posted an operating
deficit of Dollars 62m on Dollars 1.45bn in revenues.
Operating expenses were sharply lower at Dollars 1.39bn, against Dollars
1.51bn in the corresponding period of 1993.
The net loss for the most recent quarter was Dollars 48.9m, or Dollars 1.97
a share. The previous year's figures are not comparable because the company
was recapitalised when it emerged from Chapter 11.
PWA, parent of Canadian Airlines International, posted a small profit for
the June quarter, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Second-quarter
operating income was CDollars 31.6m (USDollars 22m) against a CDollars 16.7m
loss a year earlier. Net profit was CDollars 1.5m, against a loss of
CDollars 131m last time which included a CDollars 86m restructuring expense.
Revenues were CDollars 727m, up 6.7 per cent.

gold prices

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Higher gold prices helped Placer Dome, the Vancouver-based mining group, to
post a slight rise in second-quarter earnings, in spite of a drop in output.
Earnings climbed to USDollars 24m, or nine cents a share, from Dollars 21m,
or eight cents, a year earlier. Sales rose to Dollars 242m from Dollars
234m.
Placer's share of gold production from its 14 mines in the US, Canada,
Chile, Australia and Papua New Guinea fell to 449,000 ounces from 453,000
ounces. But the average price advanced to Dollars 387 per ounce, from
Dollars 357. First-half output was down to 891,000 ounces from 903,000
ounces. Higher production at five mines was offset by the disposal of the
Dona Lake mine and closure of the Equity Silver mine, and by lower
production at the Detour Lake, Kidston, La Coipa and Golden Sunlight
properties.
Placer said its share of production would total 1.8m ounces this year.
Output from Australasia was expected to dip by 7 per cent, mainly due to
lower grades at the Kidston and Porgera mines.
Production from Canada would fall by 3 per cent, but the US would grow by 5
per cent, mainly with improved grades and mill throughput at the Cortez mine
and new production at Bald Mountain.

FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: Time ticks away for Air France
reprieve - The French carrier must bite the reform bullet by 1996
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A rescue, or a temporary reprieve? That is the question confronting Air
France after Wednesday's approval of a controversial FFr20bn (Dollars 3.6bn)
capital injection for the ailing airline from its state shareholder.
The conditions attached to approval of state aid were numerous, but were
largely anticipated and scarcely aggressive, prompting strong condemnation
from several of the French carrier's rivals.
For Air France it is unclear whether the additional finance will underpin
recovery or whether it will represent just the latest, and by far the
biggest, sacrifice of funds in the airline's history of decline.
The answer will depend on whether the French national carrier finally bites
the bullet of reform and addresses the strategic and management weaknesses
behind losses that reached FFr8.48bn last year.
This is half the deficit of the world's leading airlines.
'They have to restructure, and quickly,' says Mr Guy Kekwick, analyst at
Lehman Brothers in London. 'They are in a serious financial situation, and
without the kind of reforms that other airlines have undertaken, they will
struggle to survive the next downturn in the market.'
The first FFr10bn tranche of state aid will ease the airline's immediate
financial pressures. The cost of financing its debts of more than FFr35bn
resulted in financial charges of FFr3.51bn last year, while negative
cashflow has forced the company to borrow to fund such basic requirements as
fuel.
However, under the terms of the Commission's approval for the capital
increase, the next two tranches of funds, due in 1995 and 1996, will only be
permitted if Air France delivers on a three-year cost-cutting and
restructuring plan, drawn up by Mr Christian Blanc, the chairman. In
addition it must maintain its pledge to reduce its fleet and dispose of
assets, such as the Meridien hotels chain.
Previous restructuring at Air France has failed miserably, often due to the
resistance of the airline's 14 trade unions. Last October, strikes forced a
humiliating climbdown by the French government and the scrapping of a
recovery plan drawn up by Mr Bernard Attali, who resigned as chairman in
protest.
So far, Mr Blanc has made progress in implementing his reforms. An audacious
referendum of the airline's staff in April won him approval for a framework
restructuring package, allowing him to introduce a wage freeze and to start
cutting the workforce through voluntary redundancies. Air France says the
target of 2,100 job cuts this year, from a total workforce of 39,600 at the
beginning of January, should be achieved.
There is a long way to go to Mr Blanc's objective of a 30 per cent
productivity increase over the next two years. Moreover, most industry
analysts believe the plan, scarcely more ambitious than that drawn up by Mr
Attali, is at best the minimum required for Air France's survival.
Mr Blanc is negotiating with unions concerning the reorganisation of working
practices. Changes in working hours, rotas and management structures are
vital if the productivity improvements demanded by Brussels are to be
obtained by the end of 1996. But some unions, including the pilots' union,
are opposed to the proposed productivity measures.
On the revenue side, Air France is benefiting from a rebound in passenger
traffic and an increased load factor, which averaged 72.5 per cent in the
first five months, against about 64 per cent in the same period last year.
However, the airline's wings are being clipped by the Commission's demand
that it restrict traffic growth to 2.7 per cent per year.
'This will be a constraint,' says one airline analyst. 'But the priority for
the airline is to increase the revenues per passenger rather than the number
of passengers.'
Air France has outlined plans to reduce its fleet from 166 aircraft to 149
within five years and to cut some non-profitable routes.
A thorny problem could be a transformation of Air France's relations with
Air Inter, its domestic subsidiary. The European Commission has demanded the
capital increase should go only to Air France. As a result, the French
government is proposing the separation of the two airlines and the creation
of an umbrella holding company.
The legal separation of the domestic airline may bring complications - in
particular, through an assertion of independence by the domestic airline,
which feeds many of Air France's international routes through Orly and
Charles de Gaulle airports in Paris and which is seeking greater access to
European routes.
The sensitivity of Air Inter's unions, anxious for a more equal relationship
with Air France, was demonstrated yesterday. Some union leaders refused to
attend a meeting with Mr Blanc to discuss the group's new structure,
expressing concerns that Air Inter would be left to the mercy of increased
liberalisation of the internal French airline market while Air France
receives all of the state aid.
The establishment of a new relationship with Air Inter is a complex task
which will be difficult to resolve quickly. Unfortunately for Air France,
time is firmly against it.
After the controversy of the latest capital injection, and with Brussels
adamant, this must be the last recourse to state funds, Air France must now,
or never, learn to fly on its own.

<TEXT>
International Business Machines is expected to announce plans to consolidate
its personal computer operations with the loss of about 2,000 jobs, or 20
per cent of the division's workforce.
Many of the remaining workers will be asked to move from sites in Florida
and New York state to North Carolina. The US group will also begin to
simplify its PC product line, which includes about 500 models which differ
only slightly. Management changes are also expected.
The reorganisation is designed to cut costs and boost IBM's flagging
performance in the highly competitive PC market. During the past nine months
the company has lost its leadership in PC sales, according to analysts.
While Compaq Computer's revenues jumped 53 per cent in the latest quarter,
IBM's PC sales were up only about 5 per cent and the company said its US
sales had declined slightly.
The 2,000 job losses are part of IBM's plans to reduce its total workforce
from about 235,000 to 215,000 by the end of the year. It also said it would
close one of its mainframe computer production plants, in Kingston, New
York, next year and relocate 1,500 workers to a similar plant.
The closure reflects the phasing out of IBM's water-cooled mainframe
technology which is being replaced with less expensive air-cooled models
based on complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology.

FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: Growth slows at Commerzbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Commerzbank's full operating profits rose just 11 per cent to DM438m
(Dollars 278.9m) in the six months to the end of June, after being more than
30 per cent ahead in the first five months.
According to an interim report published yesterday, partial operating
profits - which exclude earnings from own-account trading - were up 17 per
cent at DM968m.
Earnings at this level, which were about 13 per cent higher after five
months according to recent statements from chairman Mr Martin Kohlhaussen,
were bolstered by a 7.6 per cent rise in interest income, to DM2.4bn.
Commission earnings, up 5.6 per cent after five months, rose 11 per cent to
DM966m.
The main influence on the full operating profit was a 68 per cent fall, from
DM273m to DM87m, in earnings from trading activities on the bank's own
account. This was partly cushioned by a 14.6 per cent fall in provisions for
bad and doubtful debts, to DM710m.
Own-account securities trading recorded losses in June. The bank blamed
'very difficult' market conditions for much of the first half, saying higher
write-downs were necessary on the trading portfolio, the bank said.
Although no details of the June losses were given, they appear to have been
substantial, considering Mr Kohlhaussen's informal review of the first five
months, when he said own-account business was showing a 'good
three-digit-million result'.
Commerzbank, the second of Germany's biggest banks to report this week, said
it was satisfied with developments.
Deutsche Bank group, which earlier this week reported a 1 per cent rise in
full operating profits, also suffered a sharp fall in own-account trading.
It ascribed this to adverse market conditions and a sharp increase in
long-term interest rates.
However, Deutsche's earnings performance was computed on the basis of a
comparison with six-twelfths of profits for the full year. On this basis,
Commerzbank's full operating income fell 2.4 per cent, while partial
earnings tumbled 23 per cent.
In a direct comparison with the first six months of last year, Commerzbank's
pre-tax profits rose 72 per cent to DM728m, thanks in part to exceptional
profits from the merger with Commerz-Credit-Bank Europartner, and the sale
of a 15 per cent stake in the Karstadt retailing group.

FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: Detroit motors to head of the
pack - The big three US carmakers are back to strength
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The big three US carmakers may have all achieved record quarterly earnings
in the second quarter, but General Motors, Ford and Chrysler believe the
best is still to come.
The absolute level of the second-quarter profits may not be matched in the
remainder of this year - the second quarter is traditionally the most
profitable - but US carmakers dismiss some analysts' fears that the recovery
is already approaching its peak.
'We think the cycle still has several years to go,' says Mr David McCammon,
Ford vice-president and treasurer. 'We are early in the cycle in the United
States - still in the first half of the cycle, in my view. And in Europe,
we're just at the beginning of the recovery.'
The view from Detroit is much rosier than from Tokyo, Nagoya, Turin or
Wolfsburg. While rivals such as Nissan, Mazda, Volkswagen and Fiat are still
battling to staunch the flow of red ink, the US carmakers have put the
record losses and upheavals of the early 1990s firmly behind them.
Ford's second-quarter results - net profits more than doubled to a record
Dollars 1.71bn - marked the sixth straight quarterly earnings improvement.
General Motors' second-quarter net profit of Dollars 1.9bn compares with
income of Dollars 889m in the corresponding period a year ago, and a paltry
Dollars 46m in the second quarter of 1992, the only term that year in which
it scraped marginally into the black.
In 1991m, all three were heavily in loss. GM, the stumbling giant of the
world auto industry, suffered losses for three years in succession from 1990
to 1992.
The pace of the US carmakers' financial turnround pays eloquent testimony to
the volume sensitivities of the world's leading automakers. New car sales
worldwide are expected to rise by more than 5 per cent this year, ending
three years of falling demand, though the recovery has been very uneven.
In the US, car and truck sales are already in their third year of recovery:
Ford is forecasting US industry sales of around 15.5m in 1994, compared with
14.2m last year and a 12.5m nadir in 1991. The previous peak was 16.3m
reached in 1986.
In western Europe, new car sales have started to pick up in the first six
months, with an increase year-on-year of 7 per cent. However, the industry
is still struggling to overcome the shock of last year's precipitous 15 per
cent decline, the steepest fall of the post-war period.
Japanese carmakers are still desperately waiting for some reassurance that
the recession in Japan has finally bottomed out, as they suffer an
unprecedented fourth successive year of falling domestic sales and
production.
While Japanese vehicle makers, and some of their competitors in Europe, are
still grappling with domestic plants working at very low capacity, in the US
the assembly lines are humming, with many plants working overtime and
several operating round the clock.
Ford was working at 116 per cent of its so-called 'available straight-time
capacity' in the second quarter, compared with an average of 103 per cent in
the whole of 1993 and only 80 per cent in 1991.
Assembly capacity in North America has risen steadily, from 3.97m in the
1985 model year to 5.02m in 1993, and capacity is set to increase further to
5.6m in 1997/98. Chrysler is also adding capacity over the next three years
to meet rising demand.
As demand grows, all three US carmakers are gaining from the benefits of
reduced marketing costs. The discounts and rebates needed to 'move the
metal' in the bad times are being scaled down. At Ford, retail incentives
were down to Dollars 550 a vehicle in the second quarter from Dollars 755 a
year ago and Dollars 1,150 in the final quarter of 1992.
At the same time, the share of low-profit sales to big fleets, in particular
to the daily rental companies, is falling. US carmakers can now sell more of
their output through the more profitable retail channels.
The profitability of the US carmakers is also being helped by the the sharp
appreciation of the yen. As Japanese producers have been forced to make
significant price increases, the big US three have been able to keep price
rises modest, enhancing competitiveness in the showroom.
However, the climb to record earnings by the US carmakers is not only a
result of rising sales volumes and high plant capacity utilisation. All
three have undergone painful restructuring, emerging in much better shape to
do battle in the fiercely competitive global auto industry.
Chrysler, the smallest of the big three, has taken the laurels to date. Only
four years ago it was still regarded as a hopeless case, and unlikely to
survive to the end of the 1990s as an independent force. Today, after
radical reforms that have transformed all aspects of operation, it has set
new standards in the world industry. It is now the lowest cost producer
among the big three.
In the second quarter, Ford earned an after-tax profit of Dollars 945 a
vehicle, well below Chrysler's profit of Dollars 1,360 for the period. 'We
had a good second quarter, but it isn't good enough,' said Mr McCammon.

FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: Mercedes launches bid for family
bus group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mercedes-Benz yesterday announced its expected take-over bid for the
debt-laden Kassbohrer bus business from its family owners.
Talks opened on Wednesday with banks owed between DM600m (Dollars 250m) and
DM800m by the Ulm-based company, and with advisers Goldman Sachs after
preliminary talks with the Kassbohrer management which started in April.
No details of the proposed terms were released.
Sweden's Volvo group has also registered interest, but since the management
and workforce favour Mercedes ownership, it appears likely that it will win.
This is provided the cartel authorities agree to a deal that will give the
German bidder a 57 per cent share of the domestic bus market.
There have been no public objections by local competitors MAN, which has a
24 per cent market share, or Neoplan with 13.5 per cent.
Analysts have welcomed the move as essential for the rationalisation of the
bus industry, and reacted encouragingly to Mercedes' recently-announced plan
to hive off its own European bus business into a separate company.
Mr Georg Sturzer of Bayerische Vereinsbank said this week that a takeover of
Kassbohrer's Setra marque would generate unit cost advantages.
Although Mercedes would have to spend millions on restructuring, he said it
would gain improved stakes in the French, Danish, Dutch and Austrian
markets.
The negotiations mark the closing stages in the 100-year life of one of
Germany's few remaining family automotive concerns. The six warring
Kassbohrer family members surrendered their stakes to the care of trustees
earlier this year.
The break-up of the company, which lost around DM70m on sales of DM1.7bn in
1992, started that year with the sale of its trailers division to Kogel
Fahrzeuge.

FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: BCH drops 19.5% halfway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banco Central Hispano (BCH), the Spanish banking group, posted a 19.5 per
cent first-half fall in its net consolidated profits, to Pta29.3bn (Dollars
225.8m). However, it claimed it was strengthening its balance sheet and
improving the core banking business.
In contrast, Argentaria, the partially-privatised state-controlled banking
group which rivals BCH in terms of assets, raised its net income by 10.1 per
cent, to Pta47.4bn, against the first half of 1993. It attributed the rise
to lowered provisions and a 25.9 per cent increase, to Pta30.5bn, in revenue
from fees and commissions.
In common with other banks, both suffered from the impact of the sharp drop
in interest rates and a resulting squeeze on margins. Argentaria raised its
net interest income by 1.6 per cent, to Pta115.9bn, while BCH's interest
income remained flat at Pta153.1bn.
BCH, which has the largest domestic branch network, still has to develop the
cross-selling techniques which have allowed Argentaria and other banks to
raise operating profits. Income from fees and commissions at BCH fell 2.8
per cent to Pta40.6bn, although increased income from its equity portfolio,
and tight cost controls, helped raise the operating profit by 3.3 per cent
to Pta63.8bn.
Argentaria's operating profit was up by 14.1 per cent to Pta65.4bn. The net
profit total gained further from a 4.9 per cent fall, to Pta44.7bn, in
provisioning allocations.
BCH, which has had its asset quality questioned by rating agencies since the
begining of this year, was, however, forced to put aside Pta81.7bn in
provisions, 42.9 per cent more than in the first half of last year. These
allocations raised the group's coverage for bad and doubtful debts from 58
per cent to 62 per cent.
The provisions came in spite of the fact it realised Pta27.5bn through the
recovery of non-performing loans. This indicates the incipient domestic
recovery is raising the quality of its assets.
Argentaria's results could prompt the government, which sold 50 per cent of
the equity last year, to reduce its stake further. The bank's continuing
strength is also likely to fuel speculation that it will acquire a
medium-sized domestic bank to bolster its comparatively small branch
network.

FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: Larger stake in Spanish sugar
firm sought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jose Mara Amusategui, chairman of Banco Central Hispano, has received
'clear offers' from the UK's Tate &amp; Lyle and from Generale Sucriere, the
sugar group controlled by Saint-Louis of France, to buy into General
Azucacera, Spain's second-biggest sugar company, writes Tom Burns.
The French and UK producers indirectly share a 21.3 per cent stake in
Azucacera, and are seeking to acquire 10 per cent each of BCH's stake. BCH
has a 47 per cent stake.
Mr Amusategui is interested in such a disposal. However, he warned that the
government was concerned at the prospect of the company, which has a 22.5
per cent share of the domestic sugar market, falling into foreign hands.
'It is a very political issue because of the EU's sugar quota regulations,'
said the BCH chairman, 'and it is all the more sensitive because of the
large numbers of sugar beet farmers involved who supply Azucacera.'
'I think (the disposal) will go through after the summer,' he said. The
bank's stake in the sugar producer is capitalised at about Pta20.5bn
(Dollars 157.5m).

FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: Dow Chemical has best quarter
for three years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Dow Chemical turned in its best results for three years in the second
quarter, despite a 3 per cent slide, on average, in the prices of its
products.
Mr Enrique Falla, executive vice-president, predicted that prices would rise
for many of the company's basic and specialty chemicals and plastics, due to
supply constraints in the industry.
This, and improvements in productivity, would lead to further earnings
growth this year, he said.
Operating earnings of Dollars 602m were 17 per cent higher than a year
before (excluding one-off items in the year-ago period). This was achieved
on the back of sales of Dollars 4.9bn, up 2 per cent from the second quarter
of 1993, despite the lower prices.
The bulk of the earnings gain came in the company's plastics operations,
which saw a 6 per cent increase in sales, to Dollars 1.8bn.
Dow pointed to volume growth around the world, as well as higher polyolefin
prices in North America and polystrene prices in Europe. Operating income
from plastics more than doubled, to Dollars 247m.
The chemicals segment, on the other hand, suffered from lower caustic soda
prices, which pushed operating income down 12 per cent to Dollars 97m, on
sales of Dollars 1bn. Dow said it expected 'significant improvements' in
caustic soda prices by early next year.
Underlying operating earnings also fell in the consumer specialities
businesses, as the majority-owned drugs company Marion Merrell Dow saw a
shift in sales to lower-margin products. Excluding a Dollars 180m charge in
the 1993 quarter, operating income was down 16 per cent at Dollars 288m, on
unchanged sales of Dollars 1.6bn.
Net income for the period of Dollars 602m, or 91 cents a share, compared
with Dollars 388m, or 54 cents (75 cents a share before one-off items), the
year before
For the half-year as a whole, net income was Dollars 421m, compared with
Dollars 548m in the first six months of 1993, though the earlier period was
buoyed by pre-tax gains on asset sales of Dollars 502m.

FT  29 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Harrods ex-chief may join Clark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Bolliger, former managing director of Harrods, the Knightsbridge
department store, is in talks with C&amp;J Clark about joining the family-owned
shoe company.
'We are looking at a possible new role in the company for him, with
executive responsibility,' Mr Kevin Crumplin, a main board director of
Clark, said yesterday.
Mr Bolliger's departure from Harrods in April provoked a bitter war of words
with Mr Mohamed al-Fayed, the store's co-owner. At the time Mr Bolliger said
of Mr al-Fayed: 'He likes to feel he is running the store. He will even go
behind a counter and cut salami.'
Mr Bolliger said he had resigned but Harrods said he had been ousted for
unsatisfactory performance, in particular his running of the Kurt Geiger
shoe chain.
Mr Crumplin, personnel director at Clark, said that one stumbling block for
Swiss-born Mr Bolliger was that his work permit 'is running to the end now'.
'There is no certainty that he is joining us because Peter is a foreign
national,' Mr Crumplin said. 'It's up to the Department of Employment
whether or not we can even proceed, and if we then proceed we've still got
to finalise what sort of job we'd want to give him.'
Clark is also talking to other candidates. Mr Crumplin said: 'Peter is a
great shoe guy and we talk to shoe men constantly. The only safe thing I can
say is that we are in discussion with Peter,'
Clark's shareholders narrowly rejected a Pounds 184m takeover bid from
Berisford International last year. In October it appointed Mr Roger Pedder
as chairman and is still to appoint a second external non-executive
director.

FT  29 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Pillar to float with Pounds 170m tag -
Offer price represents 5.5% discount to net asset value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pillar Property Investments is coming to the market at 150p per share, an
offer price which values the company at Pounds 169.7m - a 5.5 per cent
discount to net asset value.
Two of the better-known developers of the 1980s, Mr Raymond Mould and Mr
Patrick Vaughan, are respectively chairman and chief executive of the group.
The 60m shares on offer have been placed with institutions, with 15m subject
to clawback for the public offer. Applications must be in by August 5 and
dealings will begin on August 15.
The offer, fully underwritten by BZW, will raise Pounds 87m for the company.
Of this, Pounds 40m will be used to pay off loans, with the rest used to
repay short-term borrowings and fund future acquisitions.
Pillar was set up as a vulture fund to prey on institutional quality
properties in the collapsing market of 1991. It has built up a Pounds 352m
investment portfolio, comprising 26 commercial properties.
At present, 64 per cent of Pillar's properties are let to either FT-SE 100
companies or government bodies, and there is an average unexpired lease
length of 22 years.
The company estimates that 85 per cent of its leases are now at, or below,
current market prices.
Debt will fall to Pounds 165.9m, with gearing reduced from 168 per cent to
92 per cent, improving interest cover from its Pounds 25.4m rent roll.
COMMENT
'Full but fair' was the consensus verdict on the pricing of Pillar, which
has amassed a quality portfolio of properties. The initial yield of the
investment portfolio is currently 7 per cent, but that should go up sharply
as rents rise - Pillar has a 41 per cent exposure to the retail sector,
where rents are forecast to increase rapidly over the next few years. The
shares offer a notional dividend yield of 3.1 per cent - below the sector
average of 3.8 per cent - but Pillar will be better able to increase its
dividend than other competitors with less attractive properties. The pricing
means the shares may not go to much of an initial premium, despite having
attracted solid institutional support.

The surplus was Pounds 1.23m, compared with Pounds 807,275. However, the
previous year was hit by reorganisation costs and a loss on disposal of

This time the amount was Pounds 96,400.
Turnover rose from Pounds 42.6m to Pounds 44.1m. Earnings fell from 8.48p to

Net asset value per income and residual capital share at Sphere Investment
Trust rose 20 per cent, from 36.74p to 44.19p, over the 12 months to the end
of June.
The board said it was still looking to extend the life of the trust, managed
by Marathon Asset Management, beyond its wind-up date in October 1995.
Net revenue fell from Pounds 2.83m to Pounds 2.12m, while earnings per
income and residual capital share moved from 2.31p to 1.73p. As already
announced, the second interim dividend is held at 0.75p, making an unchanged
1.5p to date.

<TEXT>
John I Jacobs, the transportation group, announced a 17 per cent decline in
pre-tax profits from Pounds 46,000 to Pounds 38,000 for the six months to
June 30.
Turnover was up some 9 per cent to Pounds 1.57m (Pounds 1.45m), largely the
result of a 40 cent increase in the shipbroking division. Mr Michael
Kingshott, appointed managing director in a boardroom shake-up earlier this
year, said this was a 'modest increase not anticipated' at the time of the
circular to shareholders in June.
Earnings per share fell to 0.1p (0.5p). The interim dividend is halved to
0.25p.

Pre-tax profits of Ayrshire Metal Products showed a 38 per cent improvement,
from Pounds 572,000 to Pounds 792,000, in the six months to end-June.
The advance was achieved on turnover up from Pounds 16.5m to Pounds 17.7m
and was boosted by a lower interest bill of Pounds 16,000 (Pounds 63,000).
An interim dividend of 1.25p (nil) is declared, payable from earnings of 5p
(3.8p) per share.
Directors said the outcome for the six months reflected the gradual
improvement in the company's markets and all parts of the group were now
profitable.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sidney C Banks, the grain and agricultural specialist, announced pre-tax
profits ahead from Pounds 2.87m to Pounds 3.42m for the year to April 30,
despite a fall in turnover from Pounds 280.6m to Pounds 231m.
Mr Alistair Mitchell-Innes, chairman, said reforms to agricultural policy
had resulted in a smaller volume of grain being sold which, coupled with
lower prices, led to a reduction in cereal turnover. Other agricultural
sectors performed well. While non-agricultural business also made a good
contribution, competition in the food business adversely affected margins.
Earnings were 25.7p (22.5p). The final dividend is 6.25p, making 9.75p (9p).

FT  29 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Sir Alex Alexander - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Alex Alexander, who has died at the age of 77, will be remembered
jointly for his contribution to the food industry and his huge fund-raising
efforts for charity and the arts.
He arrived in Britain as a poor refugee from Czechoslovakia in 1938 and rose
to the top of several British boardrooms. He never denied, and sometimes
encouraged the belief, that over the years he had accumulated one of the
best address books in the country.
Alexander was born Korda Kestenbaum in November 1916 and studied medicine at
the prestigious Charles University in Prague. He left for England at the
time of the German invasion. With hindsight it is clear that he picked up
good contacts from the start.
In the early war years he surfaced as a clerk at a gravel pit site of the
Alfred McAlpine construction group. After the war, when he changed his name,
he worked on the Westwick estate in Norfolk partly as a nurse to the family,
but also developing the estate's interest in canned fruit. It was there that
he realised the potential of the frozen food business.
Alexander went briefly to America to pick up the technology of
refrigeration. He then founded Westwick Frozen Products and by 1953 had gone
into partnership with Carl Ross, who specialised in freezing fish.
The Ross Group expanded rapidly and was taken over by Imperial Tobacco in
1969. Alexander stayed with the new grouping for 10 years as chairman of
Imperial Foods.
When he retired in 1979, there were widespread directorships - Unigate, Tate
&amp; Lyle and Alfred McAlpine, the company for which he had first worked, among
them. He also became chairman of J Lyons, the food outlet of Allied
Breweries.
He moved on to become vice-chairman of Allied-Lyons at a troubled time.
In 1985 the group was confronted with a hostile takeover bid from Elders
IXL. There was a referral to the Monopolies Commission and the case went on
for a nearly a year. The eventual ruling was in favour of Allied-Lyons,
though by then Elders had lost interest.
Alexander played some role in the defence and could be outspoken in his
public comments, but insiders tend to give much of the credit to Sir Derrick
Holden-Brown, then the company chairman, as well as the financial advisers
in the background.
More recently, Alexander has been best known for his work in the arts,
though even this had a long history. In his early Norfolk days he was
raising money for the local Red Cross. He began fund-raising for
Glyndebourne in 1973 and was responsible for introducing corporate
sponsorship. He went on to become chairman of the Royal Opera House Trust,
the fund-raising body for Covent Garden.
Stories about his powers of persuasion abound. When told that a friend had
donated Pounds 100,000 to the opera house, he growled that he had promised
Pounds 120,000. Alexander picked up the telephone and the cheque for the
remaining Pounds 20,000 was in the post.
He was married in 1946 to Margaret Irma, whom he knew in Czechoslovakia
before the war, and he was knighted in 1974. They had two sons and two
daughters.
Alexander's last main job was as senior manag-ing director at Lehman
Brothers International (Europe).

FT  29 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Johnson Fry back in black with Pounds 2.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Johnson Fry, the financial services and investment group, returned to profit
in the six months to June 30 after last year's restructuring and name change
from LIT Holdings.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 2.25m, compared with losses of Pounds 21.1m
which included exceptional losses of almost Pounds 20m resulting from the
sale of LIT America.
Turnover and operating profits were down substantially, largely because of
the ending of the business expansion scheme, formerly one of Johnson Fry's
main areas of activity.
Turnover was Pounds 18.2m, against Pounds 24.7m excluding the contribution
from LIT America. Operating profits of continuing operations fell to Pounds
2.17m (Pounds 6.32m).
Mr Christopher Castleman, chairman, said that comparisons with 1993 were
meaningless in total 'because of the very material effect on prior periods'
figures of BES revenues, the results of the American businesses which were
divested last year and the group capital structure prior to the
restructuring'.
Johnson Fry Property was the best performing division during the six months.
Turnover doubled to Pounds 8.83m (Pounds 4.31m), and operating profit rose
from Pounds 494,000 to Pounds 3.28m. Properties under management were valued
at Pounds 907m (Pounds 665m).
Funds under management by the asset management arm rose to Pounds 225m
(Pounds 145m), but fell from the Pounds 250m year-end figure despite the
launch of one new investment trust. The financial services and insurance
services divisions operated at 'about break-even'.
The group is still looking for acquisitions, which would be funded through
equity issues.
Earnings per share were 8.9p (154.1p losses).

FT  29 JUL 94 / UK Company News: All-round growth at ICI but still below
target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ronnie Hampel, ICI's chief executive and chairman-designate, yesterday
proudly boasted that every division had reported higher operating profits.
Nevertheless, the overall performance remained well short of an acceptable
target, he said.
The most profitable division was industrial chemicals where trading profits
rose from Pounds 59m to Pounds 109m, on lower sales of Pounds 1.87bn (Pounds
1.89bn). The fall in turnover followed the sale of the polypropylene
business to BASF, the German chemicals group. Taking this into account sales
volumes were up 5 per cent.
Mr Hampel said strong demand for polyester fibres and plastic bottles had
boosted demand for PTA and PET. However, pricing of Klea 134a, the
CFC-substitute, remained a problem in Japan, although sales growth was
excellent, said Mr Alan Spall, finance director.
The company was selling its Dollars 100m (Pounds 64.5m) US polyols business
to a Canadian company. The profit from the disposal would be included in
third quarter results.
Trading profits at the paints business rose from Pounds 49m to Pounds 52m on
sales down at Pounds 848m (Pounds 856m). Sales volumes were up 6 per cent
but the decorative paint sector remained subdued, said Mr Hampel.
The materials division reported trading profits up from Pounds 16m to Pounds
47m on sales up at Pounds 856m (Pounds 723m). Turnover was boosted by the
acquisition of Du Pont's acrylics side, while profits were helped by the
sale of the lossmaking fibres business. Overall, volumes were up by 11 per
cent, but margins were under pressure from rising raw material costs. Prices
of polyurethanes also remained under pressure.
Trading profits at the explosives division were Pounds 30m (Pounds 19m) on
sales of Pounds 386m (Pounds 318m) including a Pounds 65m contribution from
AECI Explosives, the 51 per cent owned South African subsidiary.
The regional business contributed trading profits up from Pounds 28m to
Pounds 35m on turnover of Pounds 702m (Pounds 690m). The economic recovery
in Australia and reduced losses in Argentina helped lift the results.

FT  29 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Portman sells land bank to MJ Gleeson for
Pounds 11.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MJ Gleeson Group, the Surrey-based construction, housebuilding and property
concern, has bought the residential development business of Portman Building
Society for Pounds 11.9m cash.
The principal assets of the land bank acquired are 413 plots of eight sites
with planning permission, 1,300 plots held under option and 33 acres without
planning permission.
Portman Homes incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 4.4m in 1993, mainly
reflecting a write-down of the value of its land bank and work in progress.
Mr Colin McLellan, Gleeson finance director, said the company was taking a
medium-term view of the housing market. 'The plots will take four years to
sell, by which time we would hope there will have been a pick-up in the
market.'
The weak housing market has depressed Gleeson's profits during the last four
years although the company has remained in the black. It reported pre-tax
profits of Pounds 8.2m (Pounds 9.9m) in the year to June 1993 and in March
it reported flat interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.1m, compared with
Pounds 4.06m.

<TEXT>
Glaxo, the drugs group, yesterday announced its 13th collaborative deal with
a biotechnology company.
Its latest partner is Sequana Therapeutics of La Jolla, California.
The two companies will work in the genetics of diabetes field; it is
unlikely to lead to any products until the next decade.
The deal comes only five weeks after Glaxo signed its last biotechnology
collaboration, also genetics, with Spectra Biomedical, the northern
California migraine specialist.
Under the latest deal, Glaxo gains exclusive rights to develop and market
drugs, while Sequana keeps the rights to any diagnostics products that might
emerge.
Glaxo will pay an up-front fee to Sequana and further cash payments as
research progresses.
It will also offer research support.

FT  29 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Independent to cut cover price - Fall
should pave way for signing of agreement with MGN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Independent newspaper has decided to cut its cover price and the
reduction is expected as early as Monday.
The response to the national newspaper price war is one of a number of
editorial and business decisions that should pave the way to the signing of
a formal agreement between Mirror Group Newspapers and the consortium that
owns The Independent group.
The agreement under which MGN, a minority shareholder in Newspaper
Publishing, owners of The Independent and The Independent on Sunday, will
run all aspects of the business apart from editorial has yet to be signed.
The plan was first announced in March but it has been considered impossible
to complete the deal until a new editor was appointed and a number of
editorial decisions had been taken.
Mr Ian Hargreaves, deputy editor of The Financial Times, this week accepted
the editorship. Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, the main founder of the paper,
will give up the editorship this week when he goes on holiday. Mr Ian Jack,
editor of The Independent on Sunday, will be acting editor until Mr
Hargreaves arrives in the middle of next month.
MGN was believed to be wary about signing the agreement before an editor was
in place because there are financial penalties if the company fails to reach
agreed targets. Apart from the issue of cover price - The Times is now
selling at 20p and the Daily Telegraph at 30p during the week - the issues
include the number of newspaper sections on offer and their format.
Having taken the decision on Wednesday to cut the price of the paper,
shareholders will decide on Sunday how much the cover price will be reduced
from its current 50p. The paper will remain a premium product aimed at the
top end of the market but the price will come down at least to 45p, to match
The Guardian, or possibly 40p.
The formal agreement between MGN and the other main shareholders - El Pais
of Spain, La Repubblica of Italy and Mr Tony O'Reilly's Irish Independent
group - may be signed within a matter of weeks.
Planning is going ahead as if the agreement is already in place and the
editorial staff of The Independent and its Sunday sister title are expected
to move to their new offices alongside MGN in Canary Wharf in London's
Docklands in November.
Meanwhile Mr Sergio Cellini, who became an executive director of The
Independent earlier this year, has been appointed managing director of
Newspaper Publishing.

FT  29 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Wet winter holds Motor World back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An exceptionally wet winter with minimal frost held back progress by Motor
World, the car parts and accessories retailer which came to the market in
February last year.
Pre-tax profits advanced by 20 per cent to Pounds 1.76m in the six months to
May 1, but the figures were flattered by lower interest payments. The
underlying increase was 5 per cent.
Turnover rose 15 per cent to Pounds 21.5m, with growth reflecting new
additions to the chain, which increased from 203 to 217 outlets during the
period. A further 25 branches have been opened since the beginning of May,
bringing the total to 242.
Mr Darrell Kershaw, managing director, said motorists were less likely to
work on their cars in wet weather, and the virtual absence of frost removed
the usual seasonal boost to sales of batteries and anti-freeze.
However, demand across the group had been improving since Easter and he
expected to see second half results benefit from the recent wave of
openings.
The Bradford-based group is mainly represented in the north of England,
Wales and the Midlands. However, it has recently moved into the south-west
and has just opened a branch in Welwyn Garden City, north of London.
It has also bought an eight-branch chain in the Irish Republic, where it is
expected that an MOT test will shortly be introduced.
The manufacturing, packaging and distribution division, which accounts for
about 30 per cent of sales, had performed well on the back of an expanding
customer base and increased sales to continental Europe.
Earnings per share rose to 8.7p against a pre-forma 8.1p. The interim
dividend is lifted to 2.5p (2.3p).

Improved trading conditions and continued emphasis on careful management
helped Admiral, the Surrey-based computing services company, lift pre-tax
profits by 46 per cent from Pounds 2.19m to Pounds 3.2m in the six months to
June 30.
Shares rose 30p to a new high of 610p. Turnover was 39 per cent higher at
Pounds 24.6m (Pounds 17.7m). Earnings per share improved by the same
percentage to 18.5p (13.3p) and the interim dividend goes up 25 per cent to
2.5p.
The group, which specialises in consultancy, training and software, has
consistently improved sales and profits through the recession and continues
to recruit steadily. Staff numbers total 854, 30 per cent higher than last
year.
Cash amounted to Pounds 3.9m, down from Pounds 5.5m 12 months earlier
because of acquisitions, including The Training Centre, purchased in
February to strengthen computer training operations, and Sumlock Legal and
products from Hay Logic, which together formed a new company, Admiral Legal
Systems. Stripping out the contribution from purchases, turnover jumped 30
per cent and operating profits 40 per cent.
Mr Clay Brendish, co-founder and chairman, attributed the performance to a
strong and continuing relationship with existing customers. The Singapore
and Australian subsidiaries were on their way to achieving critical mass and
the company was seeking to expand through acquisition in mainland Europe.
He added: 'The second half has started well for all our operating companies.
The signs are that the economy will continue to strengthen'.
Admiral tends to perform uniformly across the year, suggesting full year
pre-tax profits could approach Pounds 6.5m.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Irish Company News: International competition cuts Telecom
Eireann to IPounds 173m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Operating profits at Telecom Eireann, the Irish state-owned
telecommunications company, fell 12 per cent to IPounds 173m (Pounds 171m)
in the year ended March.
The company blamed the fall on tighter margins after the introduction of
more competitive charges last autumn, following the opening up of its
international monopoly to competitors, including British Telecommunications.
The board said yesterday it would report to the government in October on its
strategic objectives and the possibility of an alliance with an
international telecommunications company.
Mr Ron Bolger, chairman, refused to confirm whether Cable and Wireless,
which is reported to have bid Pounds 460m for a 40 per cent share of Telecom
Eireann's main operations, would make the short list.
He said the board would draw up the list of possible partners over the next
month, but declined to give details of the type of link-ups that were being
proposed. There is strong opposition even to partial privatisation from
Telecom Eireann unions and parts of the Labour element of Ireland's
coalition government.
Total turnover was up 7 per cent to IPounds 871m, due mostly to increased
contributions from subsidiaries and joint ventures. But telephone revenues
were static at IPounds 500m, despite the new tariff structure which has cut
costs for business users at the expense of domestic customers.
Pre-tax profits were IPounds 81m (IPounds 50m). The previous year Telecom
Eireann had to write off IPounds 44m to reflect the impact of the
devaluation of the punt on its almost IPounds 1bn of debt.
'Debt reduction is of paramount importance to the company's future,' said Mr
Bolger. He said debt would be an issue in any possible alliance and that
some may have to be transferred directly to the government's books.

<TEXT>
Trading started yesterday in shares of Emerging Markets Country Investment
Trust, which was created through the conversion of units in the emerging
markets unit trust run by City of London investment management.
The shares ended the day at 58p, a premium of 6.7 per cent to undiluted net
asset value. The warrants closed at 34p.
Unit holders elected to convert more than 50m units into new packages of
ordinary shares and warrants in the investment trust, at a subscription
price of 53p per ordinary share, with one warrant attached to every five
shares.
The shares have an undiluted net asset value of 54.36p, and the new trust
has a net asset value of Pounds 27.3m.
Olliff &amp; Partners, sponsor of the trust, is planning to raise up to Pounds
24m through a placing in September.
The existing unit trust will continue to operate in parallel with the
investment trust.

FT  29 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Restructuring sets Prior on recovery path
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER FRANKLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Benefits of the restructuring over the past two years have begun to show
through at Prior, the property group and architectural ironmonger.
The company yesterday reported an advance in pre-tax profits from Pounds
347,000 to Pounds 1.95m for the year to March 31, bolstered by a credit of
Pounds 2.05m after costs in respect of the release of bank indebtedness.
Mr James Prior, chairman, said the year under review had been one of
transformation for the company.
This, he said, was not only the result of the successful completion of
negotiations with the company's banks in 1993, but also of two share issues
within the past year which had raised a total of Pounds 6.89m.
The funds raised had enabled Prior to eliminate debt and release it from any
remaining liability in respect of the four subsidiaries in administrative
receivership. In addition, they provided partial funding for the purchase of
Bouverie House and a portfolio of properties from Hanson.
Following the purchases, net assets amounted to Pounds 9.3m, Mr Prior said.
The group now had Pounds 3m on deposit to fund further acquisitions, an
annual rent roll in excess of Pounds 2m, and potential tax losses to offset
against future profits, he added.
Turnover fell from Pounds 1.21m to Pounds 1.2m and earnings came out at
1.23p (0.61p) per share.

FT  29 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Two life companies buck UK sector trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two life companies have announced increases in UK new business for the first
half of this year, in contrast to the trend for the sector as a whole.
Equitable Life said that its total new premium income for the six months to
end-June was Pounds 746.9m - an increase of 12 per cent on the same period
last year. There was only a slight increase in new annual premiums, from
Pounds 186.4m to Pounds 186.7m, but new single premiums rose more sharply,
to Pounds 560.2m (Pounds 478.3m).
Within new annual premium business, the greatest percentage increase in
annual premium income was in individual pensions for directors and
executives which rose to Pounds 25.9m (Pounds 22.8m).
New single premium business saw a steep increase in individual pensions,
from Pounds 116.1m in the first half of 1993 to Pounds 164.1m.
AXA Equity &amp; Law said yesterday that its UK new business increased by 5 per
cent to Pounds 295m for the first half of 1994, while total new business
amounted to Pounds 421m - an increase of 10 per cent on the first six months
of last year.
Overseas business rose by 24 per cent to Pounds 126m.
The UK new business increase comes in spite of a 24 per cent drop in single
premium pensions business, which fell to Pounds 55m.

FT  29 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Japanese venture behind 88% advance at
Unitech
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Unitech rose 20p to 348p yesterday after the international
electronic components and controls group announced an 88 per cent increase
in full-year profits.
Pre-tax profits climbed to Pounds 19.8m (Pounds 10.5m) after increased
demand, particularly in east Asia, pushed sales ahead 20 per cent to Pounds
302.3m (Pounds 253m) in the year to May 31.
Although favourable exchange rates flattered the results by adding Pounds
29.4m to group turnover and Pounds 2.3m to profits, operating profits rose
from Pounds 13.7m to Pounds 24.4m.
The improved performance was underpinned by sharply increased profits at
Nemic-Lambda, the group's 50.6 per cent-owned Japanese subsidiary, which
contributed Pounds 12.3m (Pounds 3.6m) to the power supplies division.
Buoyant demand for power conversion equipment helped the division, Unitech's
largest, more than double its profits to Pounds 20m (Pounds 9.94m) on
increased sales of Pounds 205.4m (Pounds 164.9m).
Mr Peter Curry, chairman, said: 'This success has been driven by Japan. The
challenge now is to repeat that with our other divisions.'
The group has embarked on a strategy to increase international sales by its
two smaller businesses: connectors, which manufactures electronic testing
equipment; and control products, the heating and ventilating component
company.
Mr Curry said such moves, including joint ventures in Japan and China, would
offset flat trading conditions in continental Europe, where profits fell
from Pounds 2.6m to Pounds 927,000.
The main victim was the connectors business - based in France - which
reported a Pounds 539,000 loss compared with a Pounds 1.02m profit last
time.
Cost cuts, however, had led to improved efficiency in recent months, and Mr
Curry said the business was now trading profitably.
The control products division, meanwhile, benefited from steady growth in
the UK and saw profits increase from Pounds 2.95m to Pounds 4.8m on turnover
of Pounds 51.9m (Pounds 38.9m).
Earnings per share rose from 7.3p to 12.9p, and a final dividend of 4.32p
(4p) makes a total for the year of 6.56p (6.1p).
COMMENT
This set of results had analysts searching for superlatives. Verdicts ranged
from 'extraordinary' to 'excellent' after the figures exceeded most
forecasts for the current year. With no sign of the yen weakening or a
reversal in east Asian demand, this year's profit forecasts have been
increased on average by a third to about Pounds 28m. The challenge for
Unitech is to unlock shareholder value from its stake in Nemic-Lambda, which
is valued at Pounds 424m. If it achieves that and also manages to exploit
signs of an upturn in Europe, the shares could prove an attractive prospect,
despite their premium on a forward multiple of 18.4.

FT  29 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Medeva loses patent case in European court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Medeva, the rapidly expanding pharmaceuticals company, yesterday suffered a
setback in its development programme after the European Patent Office upheld
claims that it had infringed patents owned by Biogen, its US rival.
The UK group said it was dismayed by the ruling, made at an appeal hearing,
which could prevent it developing a Hepatitis B vaccine.
The vaccine, which has been at the centre of a legal battle between the
companies for two years, was regarded as one of Medeva's best prospects for
growth in the late 1990s.
Industry analysts estimated 1995 sales for the vaccine at Pounds 30m with
the worldwide market worth more than Pounds 200m.
Biogen said it was extremely pleased by the ruling. But Mr Bill Bogie,
Medeva's chief executive, described it as 'a surprise and disappointment'.
News of the appeal, however, came after the market closed and Medeva's
shares were unchanged yesterday at 134p.
It overturned a previous ruling in favour of Medeva, and means the company
will have persuade courts in any country where it wants to sell the vaccine
to revoke the Biogen-held patents.
The company is already seeking such a ruling in London, where the Appeal
Court is re-examining the High Court's decision last year that Medeva's
activities had infringed the US group's patents.
That ruling, expected in September, is likely to determine whether Medeva
will take similar action in countries such as France and Germany. Mr Bogie
said the company would still develop the vaccine for use in east Asia and in
European countries where the Biogen patents do not apply.
'This is a setback. But the Hepatitis B project is one element in our
broader business portfolio. Although it has great potential it is not
critical to our future success.'
Emphasising the group's determination to develop the vaccine, he predicted
that it would continue to represent a large part of Medeva's research and
development budget.
Further development of the drug may be hampered by threatened legal action
by the two Swiss companies that sold Medeva the part-developed vaccine for
Pounds 9.3m two years ago.
Epitec and GA Investments received a Pounds 3.86m down payment, with the
balance due when development was completed and the product registered in
European countries.
Earlier this year Medeva was warned of possible legal action after the
completion date for development of the vaccine was put back to 1995 -
delaying payments to the Swiss groups.

Pex, the hosiery manufacturer and distributor, announced a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 2.17m for the year to January 31 after a provision of Pounds 900,000
for stock and ongoing costs of former retail properties.
In the previous year there was a profit of Pounds 393,000 after a surplus on
restructuring of Pounds 1.3m.
The company also announced the appointment of Mr John Carr as deputy
chairman and chief executive.
Turnover was down 14 per cent to Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 14.5m) following the
company's repositioning at the upper end of the market and loss of sales at
the lower end.
Mr Peter Bailey, chairman, said that after many years of struggle 'we can
see a way back to profitability'.
Losses per share for the year were 11.35p, compared with earnings of 3.13p.

FT  29 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Mystery surrounds Caparo 'US purchase'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mystery last night surrounded an announcement by Mr Swraj Paul, the
Anglo-Indian businessman, that his privately-held Caparo steel and
engineering group had made its biggest acquisition ever by acquiring 'a
Dollars 400m US steel firm'.
Mr Paul told Reuter in New Delhi that a deal to acquire the un-named
Pittsburgh-based company was signed early yesterday.
Officials at Caparo's London headquarters were trying to contact Mr Paul
yesterday for further clarification, after he had faxed them a message
saying a letter of intent had been signed to buy 'a major American steel
plant'.
The announcement caused confusion among steel industry observers. Caparo is
known to be interested in buying Sharon Steel, an integrated producer which
is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.
But that company is based in Sharon, Pennsylvania rather than Pittsburgh.
And the plant which Caparo said it has bought makes 1.2m tonnes of
hot-rolled coils, 60,000 tonnes of cold-rolled coils and 90,000 tonnes of
galvanised sheets, which one analyst said did not sound like Sharon.
It is assumed that the Dollars 400m (Pounds 258m) in Mr Paul's announcement
refers to the revenues of the company rather than the transaction price.
Caparo has already expanded in the US. Its North American sales were Pounds
111m last year out of a total of Pounds 360m following the acquisitions of
Bull Moose Tube in 1988 and Bock Industries in 1990.
Caparo is thought to be the front-runner in the bidding for Sharon, although
a Dutch-backed group is also said to have made a cash bid.

FT  29 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Mixed fortunes for market hopefuls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Magnum Power, the Scottish electronics company, yesterday announced a
successful placing of Pounds 4.5m of shares, valuing it at Pounds 14.6m
ahead of its flotation on the USM.
But, Aromascan, the other start-up business currently on its way to the
stock market, has been forced to put back its plans by a week.
One of the company's advisers blamed the rail strike, which had prevented it
seeing some key institutions. NM Rothschild, which is sponsoring the Pounds
12m placing, has put back the impact day until next Tuesday.
Magnum, which was formed in 1990, has designed a built-in uninterruptible
power supply for personal computers, which is claimed to be half the price
of existing external products.
It claims that no other uninterruptible power supply can currently be built
into standard personal computers while meeting the technical standards
demanded by most original equipment manufacturers.
It lost Pounds 1.23m on turnover of only Pounds 59,000 in the year to May,
but in the prospectus the directors state that they believe the company will
reach the break-even point of 6,000 units a month by December 1995.
None of the existing shareholders have sold stock, and have undertaken not
to sell their existing holdings for at least two years after flotation. The
placing is sponsored by Henry Cooke.
Start-up businesses can apply for a quotation on the USM if they can
demonstrate that they will generate significant revenues with 12 months of
admission.
Aromascan, which has developed a new technology for detecting odours, is
looking to raise Pounds 12m from a placing which would value the group at
between Pounds 35m and Pounds 40m.
The money will be used for further development and the building of a
manufacturing plant. The pathfinder prospectus projects first profits of
Pounds 4m in 1997.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
National Express Group, the UK's largest inter-city coach company, is to
start an inter-city passenger service in Poland next month, becoming the
first foreign carrier to do so.
The initial investment, of Pounds 2.3m, is comprised of 21 second-hand
coaches brought from the Netherlands. Six routes are to be served in the
initial phase with Warsaw acting as a hub.
National Express already runs an international service to Poland through its
Eurolines subsidiary and recently the UK company purchased Fregata, a Polish
emigre-owned, London-based tourist operator with more than 30 years of
experience in the Polish market.
Polski Express, National's wholly owned local subsidiary, will be working
with PKS, the Polish state-owned bus company which will be providing drivers
and maintenance facilities as well as selling tickets.
PKS remains Poland's largest inter-city coach carrier with small private
companies operating urban and short-range routes. The market is shrinking,
though, as car ownership grows and ticket prices rise. Last year, 1.4bn
passengers travelled on inter-city coaches compared with 2.1bn in 1990.

FT  29 JUL 94 / ICI up 40% on worldwide revival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A combination of self-help and a surprising rise in demand assisted Imperial
Chemical Industries to a 40 per cent rise in pre-tax profits during the
first half.
The UK's largest chemicals company posted profits up from Pounds 167m to
Pounds 234m. Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief executive and chairman designate, said
the increase showed 'the first tangible signs of a widespread recovery in
our worldwide markets. This is an increasingly robust performance from all
our businesses.
'About half of the improvement came from self-help and half from better
demand. Prices were the same level as last year.'
Turnover increased 8 per cent from Pounds 4.15bn to Pounds 4.46bn. Sales
volumes were up 6 per cent during the six months, but had risen 9 per cent
in the second quarter from the same period last year. Currency movements
reduced sales by about 1 per cent.
Trading profits rose 52 per cent to Pounds 273m. Mr Hampel said the results
had benefited by more than Pounds 210m from self-help actions since 1990.
The target of savings of Pounds 490m next year was within reach, he said.
Mr Hampel said ICI would continue to invest in its core assets. It would
invest Dollars 100m to build one of the world's largest PET resin plants in
North Carolina. PET is a material used to make plastic bottles. Separately,
Mr Alan Spall, finance director, added that the group was looking at the
possibility of building a new US plant to make PTA, a raw material of PET.
The growth in volume had been driven by a number of factors, said Mr Hampel.
New plants manufacturing Klea 134a, the CFC-substitute, and PTA had come on
stream. European sales were lifted by an increase in market share as US
manufacturers attempted to cope with an upturn in demand there. Finally,
there had been some additional purchasing by customers anxious to buy before
price rises.
Mr Hampel noted a clear upturn in the market, but not as strong as might
been deduced from ICI's second-quarter figures. The rate of sales growth was
clearly unsustainable.
Second-quarter growth in the UK was 13 per cent while the European continent
saw 10 per cent growth after being flat for the first three months. European
sales were boosted by a sharp rise in methanol prices, and the UK fertiliser
business was now breaking even after a collapse of Russian imports.
Mr Hampel stressed that ICI would never again build a new ethylene plant and
that he was willing to consider selling stakes in the Wilton complex in
Teesside possibly as part of the putative flotation of EVC, its PVC venture
with Enichem of Italy.
Earnings per share rose 34 per cent from 12.7p to 17p. The interim dividend
was maintained at 10.5p.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Scholes accepts Pounds 96m bid by Hanson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scholes Group, the UK maker of electrical installation equipment, yesterday
agreed to a Pounds 96.1m bid from Hanson, more than 20 years after it first
held merger talks with the conglomerate's Crabtree subsidiary.
The takeover combines two leading domestic suppliers in a market where
continental European manufacturers are making inroads.
Mr Derek Bonham, chief executive of Hanson, said: 'It is in line with our
strategy of concentrating on major business sectors where there is scope to
build or consolidate market superiority.' He predicted that Hanson would
make more disposals this year but ruled out a share issue. 'We still think
our equity is on the cheap side.'
Hanson is offering 250p cash per Scholes share, equivalent to 32 1/2 times
earnings in the year to June 1993. Scholes' shares rose 57p to 250p.
Scholes has had merger talks with most of its rivals and in 1987 fought off
a 275p a share bid from Delta. Mr Bill Riches, chairman, said: 'The
commercial logic was always easy to establish. The problem was usually that
both sides wanted to be the boss.' The logic has become even clearer in
recent years as electrical circuit breakers, based on European standards and
technology, have supplanted traditional British Standard fusegear.
Scholes makes circuit breakers based on technology from ABB, the
Swiss-Swedish giant which has a 4.5 per cent stake. ABB has agreed to
Hanson's offer and will maintain its links with Scholes.
Hanson estimates Crabtree and Scholes together will have 23 per cent of the
UK circuit protection market, in line with France's Schneider and ahead of
Delta. Mr Bonham said the Office of Fair Trading had shown 'no particular
concern' over the deal but cautioned: 'You never know how they will define
the market.'
He said the volumes of the combined group would justify investment in
automated manufacturing. Meanwhile there would be some job losses,
particularly in administration. Scholes, whose main Wylex subsidiary is
based at Wythenshawe near Manchester, employs 1,500.
Crabtree, which Hanson acquired as part of Ever Ready in 1981, made an
operating profit of Pounds 9.3m on turnover of Pounds 68m last year while
Scholes made only Pounds 4.8m on sales of Pounds 62.7m.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Sainsbury takes store wars into a new phase: Why Wm Low has
attracted the giants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Sainsbury yesterday ushered in a new era at the UK's largest food
retailer with his 305p-a-share rival bid to Tesco's agreed 225p offer for Wm
Low.
Chairman since the start of last year, he did what none of his predecessors
had done: launched a hostile bid. It is true that because Wm Low's board had
already endorsed another offer, Sainsbury's bid is not strictly 'hostile',
but the company is at least entering a contest.
The Columbia Business School-educated chairman also took competition between
the biggest food retailers into a new phase, as the struggles over new sites
in the early 1990s and recent price skirmishing gave way to a battle for
control of a smaller player.
He may have been motivated partly by pique that Wm Low had agreed Tesco's
offer without speaking to Sainsbury - especially since it approached the
Scottish company last year only to be told Low was determined to remain
independent. Sainsbury certainly did not want to see Tesco walk off with it
at a bargain price.
But Sainsbury's bid of 305p per ordinary share and 143p per convertible
preference share - valuing the company at Pounds 210m compared with Tesco's
Pounds 154m - is seen as evidence that Sainsbury genuinely wants Wm Low.
'The 305p price is higher than expected, and clearly designed to make Tesco
think long and hard about whether to respond,' said Mr Bill Myers, food
retailing analyst at Yamaichi.
The main attraction of Wm Low to Sainsbury, as to Tesco, is the chance to
buy market share quickly and relatively cheaply in Scotland - one of the
last areas of the UK not overrun by grocery superstores. Sainsbury says the
acquisition would increase its Scottish market share from 3 per cent to 10
per cent, and its UK share from 11.4 to 12 per cent.
Sainsbury has only four stores in Scotland. Its ambitions there have been
hampered by intense competition for sites and struggles with local
authorities over planning permission.
Although many Wm Low supermarkets are small, the acquisition would give
Sainsbury 57 stores for the cost of building and opening 12 superstores.
Sainsbury says it has no plans to sell any of the stores, but admits rivals
have expressed interest and 'recognises that some of Wm Low's smaller stores
may be of greater interest to other operators'.
It believes it can make Wm Low's assets work harder and is proposing Pounds
40m investment in the stores - Pounds 5m more than Tesco.
Overheads would be cut by closing Wm Low's head office, and economies of
scale exploited by bringing the stores into Sainsbury's supply and
distribution network.
It would refurbish the stores, reduce prices and widen the range by selling
its own-label products. Some superstores would be extended and petrol
stations added.
Sainsbury believes it can raise the Scottish stores' performance towards
that of the rest of its chain, and says it is best placed to unlock their
potential as its performance ratios lead the industry. Sainsbury's weekly
sales per square foot of Pounds 18.70 are twice those of Wm Low's Pounds
9.60, and well above Tesco's Pounds 15.20. Annual profits per square foot,
at Pounds 85.50, are three times Wm Low's Pounds 27.60, and 45 per cent
above Tesco's Pounds 59.
Analysts believe Sainsbury could achieve a 50 per cent increase in Wm Low's
operating profits to about Pounds 27m in the medium term.
The acquisition would also give Sainsbury a much-needed Scottish
distribution depot. Its Scottish stores are presently supplied by trucks
from north-east England and Lancashire.
Some analysts had suggested Sainsbury might not bid for Wm Low but save its
money for a bigger acquisition in the US. However, with a successful
takeover of Wm Low projected to increase year-end gearing from 20 per cent
to only 27 per cent, it is clear Sainsbury still has scope for acquisitions
elsewhere.
Mr Sainsbury repeated yesterday that the group would investigate any
opportunities to add to its Shaws chain in the US, but this was a 'statement
of strategy, not an indication we are about to pounce on something'.
However, whether Sainsbury or Tesco eventually triumphs in the battle for Wm
Low, some suggest it could open the door to other bids for UK food
retailers.
Mr Jeremy Alun-Jones, analyst at Lehman Brothers, believes the most
significant comment came from Tesco, which said the acquisition of Wm Low
would enable it to expand its market share 'without increasing total
industry floorspace'.
If the biggest players start to believe the market is saturated and
expansion should not add to industry capacity, smaller companies such as
Iceland, Gateway, the co-operative societies, or even Wm Morrison could
become targets.

FT  29 JUL 94 / GM confirms upturn in car market with doubled profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Motors of the US, the world's biggest vehicle maker, more than
doubled its net profits to a record Dollars 1.9bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in the
second quarter from Dollars 889m a year ago.
All of the big three US vehicle makers - GM, Ford and Chrysler - have
achieved record profits in the second quarter, as they continue to recover
from the heavy losses of the early 1990s.
The profits of the big three US carmakers are rising sharply helped by the
continuing strength of the North American market and the start of recovery
in western Europe, where GM is currently the most profitable volume
carmaker.
GM remains the highest cost producer in North America with profit margins
far below Ford and Chrysler, but it is starting to reap the benefits of a
drastic restructuring of its North American automotive operations, which
have suffered losses for the past four years.
In the second quarter GM's domestic automotive operations achieved a net
profit of Dollars 723m, compared with a loss of Dollars 33m.
GM's international automotive operations also increased net profits by 77
per cent in the second quarter to Dollars 543m from Dollars 306m reflecting
continuing high earnings in Latin America and 'significantly improved
profitability' in Europe.
GM Hughes Electronics, the defence and automotive electronics subsidiary,
increased its net profit in the second quarter to Dollars 267m (Dollars
232m). Its Electronic Data Systems subsidiary raised earnings to a record
Dollars 197m (Dollars 178m), but GMAC, its financial services operation,
suffered a fall in earnings to Dollars 216m from Dollars 285m.
Mr Jack Smith, chief executive, said that GM recognised that it could not
become 'complacent'. 'We still have a lot of work ahead to improve our
earnings power and achieve target earning margins.'
In the second quarter it achieved a net margin of 2.7 per cent on its North
American automotive operations (NAO) compared with a loss of 0.1 per cent a
year earlier. International automotive operations increased their net margin
to 7.5 from 4.6 per cent. 'The dramatic improvement in NAO's margins is an
encouraging sign that we're on track. We're still considerably short,
however, of our 5 per cent annual net margin target,' said Mr Smith.
In the first half GM virtually doubled its group net income to Dollars
2.78bn from Dollars 1.4bn a year ago on a turnover, which rose to Dollars
77.9bn (Dollars 70.8bn). Before changes in accounting principles net income
rose to Dollars 33.5bn.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Paris woos trade with system to speed big share deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Paris Bourse yesterday announced the creation of a system to allow big
blocks of shares to be sold quickly.
This is calculated to recoup some of the domestic business which has
migrated to the London Stock Exchange's Seaq International trading system.
The block-trade market system, to begin operating in October, will initially
cover 50 stocks, including all component stocks of the CAC 40 Index and
other stocks with similar market capitalisation.
However, in a climbdown, the Paris Bourse said that unlike current practice,
other investors would not be immediately aware of these deals.
In contrast to the competing Seaq system, trades will be reported to the
central market after a two-hour delay or, for the largest trades, the
morning of the following day and will thus still be more transparent to
users.
'The creation of a block-trade market enhances the competitive position of
the CAC central-market system. In particular, it ensures that investors are
better informed of transactions that were previously executed in London with
no transparency whatsoever,' the Paris Bourse said.
Separately, the UK Treasury yesterday announced the Paris Bourse had become
the first European stock exchange authorised to operate in London.
Securities firms with the Bourse's CAC trading screens will be able to
transact business without having to establish a Paris office.
From January 1996, EU legislation will allow exchanges in all member states
to operate in a similar fashion.
Seaq International 'has been quite an incentive for the modernisation of the
Paris market', said Mr Jean-Francois Theodore, chairman and chief executive
of the Paris Bourse. But he said the new block trading system was also
designed to improve services for institutional investors in Paris.
The new system would cover deals at least five times the 'normal market
size' in each stock. It would calculate a 'weighted average spread' of
outstanding offers to trade those shares, creating a wider than usual
'spread' between the best buy and sell offer. However the total cost to
investors would still fall.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Bonuses give sharp boost to directors' earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Top directors' earnings at many of Britain's biggest financial services
companies have risen sharply over the last year, mainly because of large
profit-linked bonuses.
The scale of the increases is shown in the latest study of board earnings
published today by Monks Partnership, the independent remuneration advisers,
and reflect a marked improvement in financial companies' performance as the
economy recovers.
According to the study, total median earnings for executive directors
employed by financial companies in the FT-SE 100 index rose by 23.1 per cent
to Pounds 240,000, of which Pounds 94,000 was made up of bonuses. Last year
their total earnings rose by 4.9 per cent.
The highest increases in the financial sector were at the Royal Bank of
Scotland, where the top director received a 201.8 per cent rise through
bonuses. The top director's rise at SG Warburg was 197.1 per cent, and 183.2
per cent at Barclays Bank.
In industrial and commercial companies, total earnings increases for the
highest paid directors were much lower - 10.8 per cent, compared with 8 per
cent in 1993.
But there was a 98.6 per cent improvement at Cadbury Schweppes, 67.4 per
cent at Thorn EMI and 65.2 per cent at British Aerospace.
A number of industrial companies reported falls in the total pay of the
highest paid director. These group's included Guinness, Cable and Wireless,
the Argyll Group, BAT Industries and ICI.
Where a bonus is paid, it is now worth a quarter of a director's basic
salary in the industrial and commercial sector and a third of salary for top
paid directors in financial services.
'Most incentive payments at board level are dependent on the achievement of
corporate financial targets,' said Mr David Atkins, the author of the
report.
'With nearly 80 per cent of FT-SE 100 companies recording an increase in
their profits before tax, it is logical for this performance to be reflected
in an increased number of directors with a bonus award,' he added.
With the exception of the upper quartile in financial sector organisations
and the largest industrial companies, all increases in fixed pay for
executives were below last year's study.
The median rise in basic salaries for the top paid directors was 5.5 per
cent in industrial and commercial companies and 3.6 per cent for financial
and property sector companies.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Smell of decay lingers in Kigali, city of the dead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KIGALI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
There is an emptiness about Kigali which is more sinister than the mere lack
of people.
It is the city where the genocide of Rwanda's minority Tutsi community began
in April, and a faint, cloying smell of decaying flesh alerts newcomers to
the fact that in Kigali, the living are outnumbered by the dead.
After the massacres, the majority Hutu population took flight as the rebel
Rwandan Patriotic Front, led by Tutsi exiles, captured the capital. It is a
city of abandoned cars and abandoned villas. The three-month-long battle for
Kigali, which ended earlier this month, also left its scars. The parliament
building, which stood on one of the city's seven hills, was bombed beyond
repair, so the ceremony which installed Rwanda's new RPF-led government had
to be held outdoors.
There was no officialdom present at the ceremony. Most civil servants were
recruited from the ruling Hutu party, now in self-imposed exile. The new
government has no bureaucracy to execute its orders and no people to govern.
The foyer of the Meridien hotel, where half the new cabinet has taken up
residence, is barricaded with sandbags. Few of its windows withstood the
constant shelling which marked the fight for that sector of the city. There
is no electricity to lighten the gloomy interior and, like the rest of the
capital, the hotel has no running water.
Therese, a Hutu employee left in charge of the Meridien after the evacuation
of its European management, has only ventured outside the hotel once since
the RPF took control of Kigali.
'I went to see if my house was still standing,' she says. 'A Tutsi family
has taken it over.'
She does not plan to register a complaint. She fears the new government and
the boy soldiers who guard the numerous RPF roadblocks in the city. Inside
the hotel, however, she feels protected by the presence of UN troops who are
billeted there.
The RPF victory has sounded the clarion call for the Tutsi diaspora to
return home. Driven into exile by a succession of Hutu governments, the
returnees are breathing new life into Kigali. They are easy to spot in
overloaded cars with Burundese or Ugandan number plates.
Mr Protais Nkeshimana, a taxi-driver born in neighbouring Burundi, set foot
in the land of his parents for the first time this week. He chose an empty
mansion in one of the capital's smartest districts to begin a new life. 'If
the owner comes back, we will vacate the house,' he says, without much
conviction. In the new Rwanda, there are as yet no courts or police to evict
him. Outside the offices of Transintra, an international shipping company,
Emile Twahirwa has come back to inspect the damage wrought by the widespread
looting which accompanied the massacres in Kigali.
Twahirwa, a Tutsi, was separated from his wife and daughter when the
killings began. He was saved by an officer of the former Hutu army, who gave
him a Hutu identity card and helped him escape from the capital. His family
was murdered.
'Every exile I know plans to return,' he says. 'We must rebuild the country,
but this time without the ethnic distinctions that divided us in the past.'
The less affluent return on foot. A constant trickle of peasants arrive in
the capital daily in search of food and shelter. They head for the markets
where there is a brisk trade in looted goods.
Orphanages have multiplied since April, as the Red Cross and other relief
agencies rescued children from houses in which all the adults had been
killed. The convent of the Sisters of Mercy, founded by Mother Teresa of
Calcutta, looks after more than 200 children.
Those who are old enough help the nuns carry jerry cans of water which are
filled each day from a Red Cross water truck.
The nuns will not speak about the children who were dragged away from the
convent by Hutu militia. When asked whether they believe Hutu and Tutsi can
live together again, they shrug and look away. What has happened in Rwanda
has been a test of their faith.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Office rents in Far East cities outstrip west's finance
centres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rents for city offices in China and Vietnam have risen sharply this year to
become some of the most expensive in the world as international companies
seek footholds in rapidly emerging markets.
Accommodation is in such short supply that some companies are working from
hotels and town houses.
Rents in Shanghai, Beijing, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City have outstripped
leading financial centres such as London, Paris, New York and Frankfurt,
according to a study by international property consultants Richard Ellis.
Only Tokyo and Hong Kong have higher rents.
Ellis is currently operating out of rooms in the Beijing Toronto hotel in
China's capital. It says the pace of new development has been insufficient
to satisfy growing demand from international companies.
Rents in Shanghai and Beijing have rocketed by 30 per cent in the past six
months alone. The shortage of space has left 'a number of foreign businesses
operating from hotel rooms', says the agent.
Hotel rooms also have been converted into office space in Guangzhou, where
rents have risen by 9 per cent in the past six months. In Hanoi and Ho Chi
Minh City, in Vietnam, companies have been forced to rent town houses,
villas and hotels.
A total of 1,500 foreign companies are housed in just 10 dedicated office
buildings in Shanghai, China's main financial centre, where some of the
country's biggest property developments are under way.
Cities in the South-East Asia account for eight out of the 11 most expensive
office locations according to the agent, which compared accommodation costs
in 45 business centres.
Most expensive was the inner central district of Tokyo where rents of Pounds
98.32 a sq ft increased to Pounds 111.67 after service charges and property
taxes. Total occupation costs in Hong Kong were Pounds 97.05 a sq ft.
London remains the third most expensive city with total occupation costs of
Pounds 68.71 a sq ft in the West End and Pounds 61.88 in the City - but this
does not include rent free periods and other inducements offered to tenants
in a market which until recently remained very depressed. Also, property
taxes are expected to fall sharply in London next year.
Paris was the eighth most expensive location and New York mid-town was the
13th, with total property costs of Pounds 47.72 and Pounds 38.85 a sq ft,
respectively.

FT  29 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: ICI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's half-year figures from ICI were better than the modest rise in
the shares suggests. The company has outperformed the stock market by 7 per
cent since the end of March, so it is quite a feat to live up to its star
billing. The 9 per cent growth in chemical volumes in the second quarter is
especially encouraging. With prices of most basic chemicals clearly on a
rising trend, there is plenty for shareholders to look forward to.
It could be hard for ICI to sustain the current momentum. While European
recovery should lend support, stock building ahead of price increases may
have helped to boost volumes. The rate of volume growth may therefore be
less impressive through the second half of the year. Even so, recent results
from US and continental European chemicals companies suggest volumes are
growing faster than seemed possible at the start of the year. With capacity
utilisation rising - and in ICI's case cost-cutting still flowing through to
the bottom line - the operational gearing could be impressive. A multiple of
around 25 times this year's forecast earnings begins to look realistic after
all.

FT  29 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Sterling
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling's periodic bouts of weakness in the past couple of days, which took
it down to DM2.4050 at one stage yesterday, suggest it is becoming caught up
in UK interest rate fever. On the surface this looks odd. A competitive
exchange rate and economic recovery in the UK's leading export markets
should not add up to balance of payments problems. The economy is growing
nicely and though there are some signs of future inflation, they are as yet
a matter of nuance. There is little tangible evidence that price rises are
already accelerating.
Yet the exchange market would have grounds for concern if the authorities
botch the turn in interest rates. Poor demand from domestic institutions for
this week's gilts auction is a stark reminder that the government needs
foreign capital to cover its deficit. That means maintaining sterling's
attraction, and by some yardsticks short-term rates are unnaturally low.
Three-month interest rates on D-Marks and sterling are roughly level, but on
average over the past 20 years sterling rates have been some 4 percentage
points higher. The UK's progress in curbing inflation may be commendable but
it is surely not enough to eliminate this premium altogether. The Bank of
England's inflation report next Tuesday will provide another insight into
inflationary expectations. If it paints a gloomy picture, the exchange
market may demand interest rate action sooner rather than later.

FT  29 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Sainsbury/Wm Low
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
J. Sainsbury's Pounds 210m bid for Wm Low is cleverly pitched. Having
crunched the numbers, Sainsbury clearly calculated that a price of 305p a
share would give it a serious chance of winning without threatening earnings
dilution. Had the offer been any lower, Tesco would have had no hesitation
in rushing in again. Had it been any higher, the market would have worried
that Sainsbury had dropped its trolley. It is curious that Sainsbury did not
seek Low's approval. Then again, unless Tesco responds, Low has no option
but to accept given that Sainsbury's bid is all cash and some 36 per cent
above the original offer.
The market assumes Tesco will raise the stakes again. Low's shares closed
19p above Sainsbury's offer price. But Tesco would have to work hard to
justify re-entering the fray at that level. Arguably Low is worth more to
Sainsbury because of the latter's smaller presence in Scotland and lack of
distribution facilities. Sainsbury may also be able to recoup more money
from selling on some of Low's smaller stores while Tesco appears committed
to trading from all of them.
What follows will be an test of the industry's claims to maturity. In recent
years, similar, if more private, auctions were conducted around the country
as grocery chains bid up superstore sites to ridiculous prices. The sums
involved for Low are small and the penalty for overpaying would not be
great. If bidding goes higher, the market may nevertheless attach more
credit to the company that walks away than the one that wins.

FT  29 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Byatt leaves the tap on
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ian Byatt, the water industry regulator, will take more flak from
environmental groups than from the City after yesterday's price review. Most
of the 10 privatised water and sewerage companies should be able to deliver
real dividend growth of perhaps 3-4 per cent through the second half of the
decade. That should satisfy even the institutions which had urged the
industry to stand its ground. Cash flows should support capital spending
without pushing gearing to uncomfortable levels or prompting rights issues.
Yesterday's rally in the sector is more than justified.
Yet not all the companies have benefitted equally. Mr Byatt's trick of
pleasing investors while keeping water bills relatively low has been
achieved by paring capital expenditure to the bone and setting demanding
efficiency targets. Companies that anticipated this by trying to keep
capital spending low (in the case of Welsh) or being rigorous in pursuit of
efficiency (especially North West) have been rewarded. South West, which
asked the regulator to sanction large increases in household bills to fund
an ambitious capital programme, has come off worst.
Even if it misjudged the regulatory game, though, South West has reason to
feel hard done by. Its appeal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission will
be on the basis that spending allowed by the regulator - barely 40 per cent
of what the company asked for - is insufficient to meet legal obligations.
But the real fight will be over Mr Byatt's methodology.
His approach in assessing the capital value of the companies at flotation -
market capitalisation less cash - is particularly cruel to South West, which
was endowed with cash to cover its particularly large environmental spending
needs. It gives an initial value of around Pounds 150m, which looks
unrealistically low and therefore exaggerates its actual return on capital.
The MMC must decide whether to overturn a methodology which produced roughly
the right answer in nine out of 10 cases.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Leading Article: UK telecoms
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It lacked the razzmatazz of the Clinton administration's 'superhighways'
rhetoric, but the vision for the future of interactive telecommunications
services set out this week by the House of Commons trade and industry
committee was just as arresting.
The committee raised the spectre of Britain being left behind by the US and
Japan if it fails to invest in taking fibre-optics into local telecoms
networks. It placed the onus for building such a network squarely, and
rightly, on the private sector, which is well able to finance telecoms
investments.
It would be a mistake to believe that the UK is in fact languishing. On the
contrary, it is up with the leaders. BT's long-distance network is entirely
fibre-optic, as is a high proportion of its local business connections.
Cable operators are building local fibre and coaxial networks with
interactive capacity across most of Britain. Within two years, as much as 85
per cent of the mainland population will be covered by cable franchises.
The competition which cable operators are bringing to UK telecoms is good
for customers, good for innovation and good for British Telecommunications,
which remains overwhelmingly dominant a decade after privatisation. It was
to encourage such competition that in 1991 the government gave an
undertaking not to allow BT to carry broadcast entertainment to domestic
subscribers until some time after 2001.
BT claims that the ban is delaying investment it would otherwise make in
local fibre-optic systems, and parades itself as the only operator able to
build an integrated UK superhighway. Seeking to balance BT's claims with the
needs of the cable industry for start-up protection, the trade and industry
committee has proposed a timetable for ending the BT entertainment ban which
would leave the company free to compete across the board by 2003.
BT's claims need to be taken with a pinch of salt. It is already investing
heavily in local fibre networks, and would be foolish not to do so given the
range of business and domestic interactive services not covered by the ban.
It would be a serious loss to the UK if steps were taken which undermined
the capacity of cable operators to fund their business plans.
It is nonetheless in the interests of all parties, and the country at large,
that a clear timetable be established for allowing open competition in
domestic entertainment. The detail of the committee's recommendation is
problematic, but its broad thrust in favour of ending the ban by 2003, and
earlier in places where cable companies are well-established, is eminently
reasonable. It would give the UK the benefit of state-of-the-art networks
and a competitive regime likely to make best use of them.
The onus is now on the government to adopt that course. It cannot hide
behind Oftel, the telecoms regulator. This is a matter of public policy
requiring a government statement.

Western govern-ments and institutions are finally getting their act together
over Ukraine. The Group of Seven industrial nations wisely announced at
their recent summit that Ukraine could expect more than Dollars 4bn once it
adopts meaningful economic reforms. When Ukraine's voters ditched do-nothing
President Leonid Kravchuk and elected Leonid Kuchma, the G7 announcement
suddenly opened the way to concrete actions.
While International Monetary Fund managing director, Michel Camdessus, has
rightly opted to press the western case by making an early call in Kiev on
the new president, one big problem remains: the IMF advice itself, in
particular its monetary policy.
The most urgent question facing the IMF - whether in Ukraine, Russia,
Kazakhstan or elsewhere - is how to help a bankrupt government trying to end
high inflation. The IMF's approach is straightforward - sharp cuts in the
budget deficit, a low target growth of the money supply, high real interest
rates, and a floating exchange rate. But while these policies will end high
inflation in the long run, they almost invariably lead to an unnecessarily
deep recession; indeed, often to a reversal of the policies themselves, as
recent history in Ukraine and other former Soviet Union countries confirms.
The IMF has always blamed the governments for not following through, not
recognising that its advice has played a significant role in these failures.
There is a better way. Stabilisations in Israel in 1985, Bolivia in 1986,
Mexico in 1987, Poland in 1990, Argentina in 1991 and Estonia in 1992 have
been based on a different principle. These governments recognised that low
money growth was not enough. It was also necessary to bolster expectations
of low inflation and to raise confidence in the money, in order to raise
money holdings and to reverse capital flight. This was accomplished by a
strong government commitment to a stable exchange rate, at least for several
months, together with other fiscal, monetary and privatisation measures
along normal IMF lines.
Exchange rate stabilisation serves several key functions in ending high
inflation. It directly limits price increases in tradeable goods, thereby
providing a 'nominal anchor' to the price level. It ties the government to a
highly visible target. It co-ordinates future price expectations around a
common standard. It raises confidence in the currency, especially when the
pegged rate is backed by international resources or gold, as in the case of
most of the highly successful programmes.
Countries making a clear commitment to a pegged exchange rate have done much
better than countries simply allowing their exchange rate to float. Most
recently, in the Baltics, the pegger, Estonia, outperformed the floaters,
Latvia and Lithuania, until the latter countries relented and adopted
Estonia's approach earlier this year.
The notable stabilisation programmes of the past decade - Israel, Bolivia,
Poland, Argentina - were usually carried out despite the IMF, not because of
it. Estonia's currency board system was launched over the heated initial
objections of the IMF staff, though finally with IMF support when Estonia
went ahead undeterred.
The IMF's poor monetary advice continues on seeming auto-pilot. Last week,
it approved a bizarre programme for Kyrgyzstan. The Kyrgyz budget deficit is
a respectable 4 per cent of gross domestic product but inflation is above
100 per cent, because of a lack of confidence in, and a continuing flight
from, the new national currency. Remarkably, the Kyrgyz money supply is 3
per cent of gross domestic product, so slight is the confidence in the
money] The situation cries out for a defence of the currency, backed by an
international stabilisation fund. Instead, the IMF plan calls for more
budget cuts, and a further decline in the ratio of money to GDP. Even the
IMF's own research department concluded last December that the 'exchange
rate anchor' can 'enhance the credibility of stabilisation initiatives'.
There are still chances, though. Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and
elsewhere are all led by presidents prepared to push strong reforms, and to
wrestle with parliamentary resistance. The G7 and Mr Camdessus have taken
important steps to make the western support more active and timely. Now the
goodwill must be backed up with good ideas - currency stabilisation
supported by IMF and international resources. Renewed confidence in the
national currencies in these countries would be a crucial step to a renewed
confidence in economic reforms and in a democratic future.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Too much of a good thing: The Czech Republic is experiencing
the problems of post-communist success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ambition of Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime minister, to transform the
former communist state into 'a normal, standard country' was taken a step
forward with the recent upgrading of the Czech Republic's credit rating by
the US agency Standard &amp; Poor's. But the move is, ironically, likely to
encourage foreign capital inflows to a central bank already suffering an
embarras de richesse.
Few would have predicted this 18 months ago when the Czech Republic, formed
after the divorce from Slovakia in January 1993, was facing an outflow of
funds and hastily raising Japanese yen and US dollar loans to bolster
reserves.
Since then the republic has found markets in the west to compensate for a
sharp decline in exports to Slovakia and has returned to economic growth
after four years of declining gross domestic product.
The republic is now perceived as politically and economically the most
stable of the post-communist states. As a result, Mr Jozef Tosovsky,
governor of the Czech National Bank, has faced an uphill struggle over the
past nine months to neutralise the inflationary potential of increasing
foreign inflows.
'Without our open market operations (issuing treasury bills) to mop up these
funds, money supply would have broken through the nominal 14 per cent annual
M2 growth target consistent with 2 per cent real GDP growth and 10 per cent
inflation,' says Mr Tosovsky. 'The central bank has taken in Dollars 1.8bn
since the start of the year and we expect this to rise to Dollars 3bn before
the year is out,' he says.
The central bank now believes its forecast of 2 per cent GDP growth this
year probably understates private sector growth. But independent foreign
forecasters, such as Deutsche Bank research, are sticking to a modest 1 per
cent growth, against 3.5 per cent for Poland.
The capital inflow, which has seen net official reserves rise from Dollars
3.87bn in late 1993 to Dollars 5.18bn in mid-July, has sparked off a sharp
policy debate over the role of foreign investment and the timetable for
making the Czech currency, the koruna, fully convertible for both investment
and trade purposes.
Faced with potentially destabilising inflows of foreign capital, the central
bank is arguing for a tighter fiscal policy which would result in a budget
surplus rather than the current balanced budget. It is also pressing for
full convertibility of the Czech koruna by 1995, although this would
increase the attraction of the republic for foreign investors.
Mr Klaus, who dominates government economic policymaking, is more cautious.
He likens full convertibility to jumping out of an aircraft without a
parachute. He wants controls over capital movements until the domestic
banking system is better able to compete with foreign banks, and newly
privatised enterprises have been revitalised by their owners and managers.
What worries Mr Klaus is that much of the current inflow of foreign capital
takes the form of foreign bank loans to Czech companies. He argues companies
should take on foreign loans only when fully privatised and in the hands of
managers experienced enough to take on such debt and make sophisticated
investment decisions.
The self-confident and outspoken Mr Klaus has taken an increasingly tough
line on foreign investment. He is a critic of foreign advisers as 'purveyors
of soft advice for hard currency' and castigates would-be foreign investors
who seek favourable treatment from the government which would put them at an
advantage over domestic competitors. Earlier this year he showed his anger
over Volkswagen's failure to consult his government, still majority
shareholder in the Skoda/Volkswagen joint venture, before downgrading its
investment plans and cancelling a large foreign loan.
Mr Klaus's outspoken views, coupled with delays and confusion over the
future role of foreign oil companies, has given an impression that the newly
confident Czechs are becoming more ambivalent, if not hostile, to foreign
investment.
It is an impression Mr Klaus sought to dispel at a meeting with senior
executives from Siemens, the German electrical engineering group, in Prague
this month. He assured them he was in favour of foreign investment, but drew
a distinction between foreign equity investment by western companies and
financial inflows into Czech companies that may have been privatised but not
yet restructured.
Policymakers at the central bank are keenly aware of the irony of their
situation. They are gratified that sound money policies, low foreign debt
and political stability are attracting equity investment and reducing
dependence on international financial institutions. Earlier this year the
central bank even repaid in advance a Dollars 430m International Monetary
Fund loan facility not due until 1995. But faced with rising foreign capital
inflows, they worry that the economy is not yet ready to absorb it.
It is clearly better to be at the receiving end of foreign capital inflows
than suffer an uncontrollable capital flight such as in Russia, Ukraine and
other former communist economies.
Like other former communist states, the Czech Republic has a huge backlog of
much-needed infrastructure development in transport and telecommunications,
housing and the like. Thousands of new or newly privatised companies also
need fresh capital which the domestic commercial banks remain reluctant to
loan until the companies establish a reliable track record. The debate is
about how to make the economy better able to absorb the newly available
foreign capital.
Until now the emphasis of Czech economic policy has been on monetary
stabilisation, fiscal reform and privatisation. The question is how far
policy priorities can shift towards faster growth without re-igniting
inflation. Price rises fell to 9.4 per cent on an annual basis in May
against 22 per cent in 1993, when inflation jumped following the
introduction of value-added tax at a rate of 23 per cent on most goods at
the start of the year.
One option under review is to speed up the rate of bankruptcies among
loss-making enterprises and live with higher unemployment. Until now
industrial wage rates have been kept artificially low, under 10 per cent of
German labour costs, by an ostensibly free-market government which imposes
penal taxation on companies raising wages above inflation.
This policy has helped ensure that a large-scale transfer of labour to the
booming private sector has occurred without the high and potentially
destabilising transitional unemployment accompanying market reforms in
Poland and Hungary, and looming in Russia.
But unemployment remains below 4 per cent for two reasons. First, low wages
have reduced the pressure to close loss-making enterprises, ensuring that
thousands of under-employed workers still remain officially employed.
Second, hundreds of thousands of jobs have been created in tourism, banking,
retailing and services of all kinds.
The sceptics argue that artificially low wages and the government's
reluctance to implement a tough bankruptcy law merely perpetuate hidden
unemployment inside loss-making factories which have also survived by piling
up unpaid inter-enterprise debts.
A tougher approach to bankruptcies would expose the full extent of the
problem. So would tighter surveillance of bank lending.
As foreign funds flow in and the private sector in an increasingly
service-orientated economy expands, the Czech authorities are under pressure
to enforce fully the plethora of banking, securities and other new laws.
Foreign fund managers such as Mr Nigel Williams of Creditanstalt, the
Austrian-based bank, in Prague, say that giving substance to laws and teeth
to the new regulatory bodies is essential, if the foreign capital inflow is
to be sustained and used to build the 'standard' economy sought by Mr Klaus.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Observer: Iri comes again
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
No one was more surprised than Michele Tedeschi himself when he was chosen
to chair Iri, Italy's giant state holding company. He hadn't been gone long.
It was only last year that the 54-year-old lawyer was pushed sideways from
the chief executive slot at Iri and sent to manage Stet, the telecoms
utility. At that time, the Ciampi government had hauled back Prof Romano
Prodi, the Bologna economist, to act as chairman of Iri and accelerate
privatisation.
There is a bit of a pattern here, because Prodi was also a repeat
performance, having been in charge of Iri between 1982 and 1989. First time
around he felt his political masters had obstructed plans for proper reform.
At his next shot, he only had 12 months before the Berlusconi government
took office, whereupon he left, expressing his fears that the new rightwing
coalition would allow him insufficient rein.
In being recalled, this time as overall boss, Tedeschi sees himself as a
technocrat who has spent more than 25 years working in-house at Iri.
But his is also a political appointment and his fate is likely to be tied to
that of the government.

The UK beer industry, struggling to stem the flow of duty-free continental
European imports, should raise a glass to John Major's choice of David
Heathcoat-Amory as paymaster general.
The former foreign office minister's uncle Derick was, after all, one of the
very few British chancellors - Sir Stafford Cripps being another - to have
cut tax on beer excises. In April 1959, he lifted a whole tuppence off per
pint.
Good to hear one minister has duty-cutting in the genes.

The six Kassbohrers who hold stakes in the century-old family bus maker have
little to celebrate over the company's impending sale to Mercedes.
They missed a fat chance in 1988 when Canada's Bombardier offered DM100m for
25 per cent of the enterprise and an option on the rest.
Since the business was having one of its better years, they refused the
bait, despite urgings from the chairman Heinz Ahrens.
Rich in tradition, Kassbohrer has long been racked by family feuds and
general interference. Now it has finally come to a sale, the family members
must await their turn behind 30 odd banks owed a tidy DM700m.
The company ran up against the crash barrier at the beginning of this year,
as executives returned to the lenders, yet another begging bowl in hand.
After years of trying to shift the family's implacable opposition to
takeover, Ahrens had been stung by seeing his own job advertised last
November and was already making for the emergency exit.
At the same time, a works assembly in Ulm treated the family to a public
roasting, and made clear they wanted the family out and a rescuer in. And
so, it emerged, did the banks.
Led by Bayerische Hypo, they agreed to new credits to help the company over
the hump, on condition the family ceded control. Trustees held their stakes
while the manoeuvring got under way.
Now Mercedes is meeting the banks, leaving the family hovering in the
station waiting room.

When fund managers Jupiter Tyndall Merlin put former chancellor Norman
Lamont on the board of two of their Far Eastern investment trusts, the spiel
was that he would lend prestige in a part of the world where any old
ex-chancellor prompts much bowing and scraping.
Now Eurosceptic Lamont, he of the ERM crisis, has popped up on the board of
the same outfit's European trust. Fund manager Richard Pease had to admit
the chancellor would not be accompanying him when he goes avisiting his
continental investments.
But his presence will lend a certain symmetry to the board. Of the six
directors, half are now old Rothschild contemporaries.
Not only is John Craig, ex banking head at Rothschild, the trust's chairman.
But James Roe, who worked in investments with Lamont before the latter came
to Westminster, is also a director.

With 50 companies in line for flotation, the seven members of Greece's
capital markets committee, watchdog for the Athens bourse, are not heading
to the beach. But their diligence goes unrewarded.
They started work last December, following the passage of a new law giving
them significantly sharper teeth, but the long-suffering regulators have yet
to see a drachma in remuneration. To add insult to injury, the committee is
still stuck in dingy, cramped offices in the economics ministry, even though
it was given full independence and, theoretically, its own premises.
Far from being a socialist ruse to block measures inspired by the previous
conservative regime, the delay seems to be down to good old-fashioned
bureaucracy. The decree defining the salary scale awaits the president's
signature. So the ex-bankers, lawyers and university professors will be
living off their savings for a while yet. Nothing gets signed in August.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Watered-down regulation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the run-up to yesterday's review of water pricing, the industry
regulator, Ofwat, raised expectations that it would be searching and
combative. But its conclusions are disappointing.
Ofwat's review, the first since the industry's 1989 privatisation, comes at
a crucial time for the water companies and their regulatory regime. Since
privatisation, water and sewerage bills have risen annually by more than 5
per cent, on top of inflation. The rises have been driven by the spending
needed to modernise miles of crumbling sewers and water mains, and by the
companies' legal obligations to comply with European environmental rules.
But they have provoked anger among customers, not least because of the large
hikes in water chairmen's salaries.
Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat's director-general, has done a good, tough job in
tackling one of the two main tasks of the review: setting the size of the
capital spending programme which can be passed on to customers over the next
decade. He has allowed only Pounds 24bn, several billion pounds less than
the industry had demanded. He has also performed a valuable service in
taking a closer look at the likely cost of European rules than any
politician cared to do before giving Britain's backing to the directives.
His conclusion - that the industry has overstated the potential costs by
billions of pounds - is surely right. He has concluded, too, that companies
can cut operating costs by some 14 per cent in real terms by 2005.
However, Mr Byatt has been unnecessarily generous in the review's second
task of setting the annual price rises. He rightly paid no heed to the
industry's plea that it needed a real rate of return on capital of 9.5 per
cent to finance new investment. But in settling on a figure of 5-6 per cent,
he has left the companies' ability to service their debt in a comfortable
state, as a relieved stock market indicated yesterday. Return on total
capital, now running at 13 per cent, is likely to fall to about 7 per cent
over 10 years. Moreover, analysts are still expecting dividends to rise by
some 4 per cent annually in real terms. Unsurprisingly, only one company,
South West Water, had indicated by last night that it would ask the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission to examine Ofwat's ruling.
Mr Byatt is vulnerable to the charge that shareholders have been treated too
generously, as they were in 1989. He rightly insisted that he is a public
servant, not a politician. The question, however, is whether the formulae
are as tough as they could have been. Yet the review does highlight
questions, beyond Ofwat's remit, which must be tackled if the burden is to
be distributed more fairly. One is the extent of regional disparities: areas
with long coastlines, such as the south-west, are forced to pay a
disproportionate amount. A second is whether polluting industries should not
foot more of the clean-up bill.
Those questions need to be addressed by ministers. Their squeamishness is
understandable, since water is political poison. The review has not changed
that: households still face a highly regressive, rising tax. The government
cannot, however, devolve to the regulator the entire question of who should
pay for clean water.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Indian reform
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
India's capacity to respond to economic crisis is remarkable. What is more
questionable is the country's willingness to persist with tough reforms once
a crisis has been overcome. There is an inclination towards complacency, if
not sloth, instead. As the International Monetary Fund warns in this year's
annual report, that is the risk India is running now.
Much has been achieved since the country found itself on the verge of a
default on its foreign debt in June 1991. The exchange rate has been
floated; trade and industrial policy regimes liberalised; financial sector
and tax systems reformed; inflow of foreign capital encouraged; and the
budget deficit reduced. By last financial year 1993-94, the current account
deficit had disappeared, as export performance improved (and the economy
entered a period of slow growth). Simultaneously, an unexpectedly large
inflow of private foreign capital led to a rapid increase in foreign
exchange reserves, to some seven months of imports by the end of last
financial year. The crisis had indeed been overcome.
For all that, further reform is vital. Among the biggest remaining problems
is the inefficiency of public enterprise. Of the central government's 237
active industrial enterprises, 104 lost a total of Rs39.5bn (Pounds 1.9bn)
in the year to March 1993. The profits of most of the rest were inadequate,
the total return on capital being a mere 2.4 per cent. Yet public
enterprises employ 46 per cent of the capital stock and dominate essential
industries, such as transport, telecommunications, banking, oil and electric
power.
Probably the main reason for the failure to privatise public enterprise  -
and, indeed, to deregulate the labour market itself - is fear of organised
labour. Yet the proportion of the labour force working in the public sector
is a mere 6 per cent. The privileges of this tiny minority are being
supported at the expense of the population as a whole.
Equally bad, there has been a deterioration on the macroeconomic front. Last
financial year the fiscal deficit was over 7 per cent of gross domestic
product, not 4.7 per cent, as had been planned. There is growing concern
that the deficit will not fall fast enough, while inflation has reared its
head once more.
It is not that Indian reform is to be written off, still less that another
crisis is round the corner. The danger, instead, is that enough may only
have been done to bring Indian economic growth over the rest of the decade
to some 5-6 per cent, at best. This is not good enough for the future of
India's impoverished multitudes. What is needed is more ambition and less
toleration of mediocrity.

<TEXT>
On the face of it, Mr Eugene Ludwig does not have too much to worry about.
As a leading US bank supervisor - he oversees the health of 3,700 banks with
60 per cent of total US banking assets as Comptroller of the Currency - Mr
Ludwig has to protect an industry in remarkably fine fettle.
After recovering from reckless lending and over-expansion in the 1980s, the
country's 13,000 banks have more capital than in decades. This gives them a
cushion in case they should repeat such mistakes. But it has not stopped Mr
Ludwig warning of the new array of dangers they face.
Mr Ludwig was among the first to talk of risks facing banks such as JP
Morgan and Bankers Trust that dominate trading in derivatives - complex
instruments whose value is based in part on that of an underlying financial
market. It has brought him an unusually high profile for a Comptroller of
the Currency, an influential but traditionally low-profile and
little-understood job.
He was appointed by the president in April last year partly because of his
experience as a lawyer dealing in bank regulatory issues, and partly for a
more obvious reason: having met Bill Clinton as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford
in the late 1960s, he took a law degree at Yale with both Bill and Hillary
Clinton.
Mr Ludwig's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has to fight for
recognition partly because there are three other bodies involved in US bank
supervision - the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of Thrift Supervision,
and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
The Treasury wants to replace this supervisory web with a single Federal
Banking Commission. It has run into opposition from Mr Alan Greenspan,
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, who wants to preserve separate powers
for the Fed.
The US debate is unfolding as the future of banking supervision is being
called into question. As banks switch towards securities trading and
underwriting rather than lending, some question whether supervisors can keep
up.
Mr Greenspan has talked of banks having to self-regulate trading activities
because of the growing complexity of financial markets. This issue has
particular force in the US. Teams of examiners from the Office of the
Comptroller work full-time in the largest banks, and their approach has been
criticised as bureaucratic and over-prescriptive.
Mr Ludwig disagrees. 'In the early 1980s, we saw the view that off-site and
minimalist supervision was the best way to ensure growth, and the pendulum
swung in that direction. I would not say it caused the problems of banking
in the late 1980s, but it certainly exacerbated them,' he says.
Nonetheless, his office has been trying to devise separate approaches for
small community banks, and the large banks that operate sophisticated
trading operations. The examiners will remain on-site at the latter, but
will examine management controls and technology, not individual loans.
He supports the idea mooted by the Basle Committee of banking supervisors
from the Group of Ten leading industrial nations, that banks should use
their computer models to allocate capital to cover the risks of trading
securities and foreign exchange. 'We are recognising the modern world, and
taking advantage of a private sector capability.'
But he is sensitive to the criticism that supervisors may be letting banks
off lightly: 'This can be misunderstood, as if banks are inventing their own
capital regime.' Instead, he says that banking supervisors worldwide will be
'serious' about the criteria for approving the computer models.
As for US banks, Mr Ludwig is not entirely sanguine despite their strong
capital and the likelihood that they will record large earnings this year.
One reason is the danger that banks will - as he puts it - 'take bigger and
bigger risks' to maintain their returns on ever-increasing levels of
capital.
A second concern is the long-term decline in the banking industry - in terms
of financial assets - as companies have turned to bond and equity markets
for capital rather than bank loans, while individuals have saved through
mutual funds. Between 1980 and 1990, banks' share of financial assets
dropped from 37 to 32 per cent.
Mr Ludwig says it is not his job to worry about the banks' falling share of
assets. 'We are not cheerleaders for the industry. We are responsible for
maintaining its soundness,' he says. But he argues that  - provided they do
not take excessive risks - banks should be allowed to diversify into selling
other financial products.
Further, Mr Ludwig says the fall in assets presents a false picture, because
banks have concentrated on activities such as trading securities, which do
not expand balance sheets. 'Banks have very successfully generated fees. The
jury is out on whether banking is really in decline,' he says.
A more pressing question is the supervision of derivatives, an activity
which has expanded to the point where it forms a substantial part of the
business of some large OCC-supervised banks. This growth in itself is a
warning signal, according to Mr Ludwig.
'Like any financial activity in its infancy, or childhood, or maybe young
adolescence, it must be subject to a large degree of serious supervision,'
he says. But in practice, he says he has been 'rather impressed by the risk
management systems' of the large dealers of derivatives.
Nor is he worried that his staff will be baffled by the complexity of
pricing derivatives portfolios. The OCC has recruited a number of
derivatives specialists from banks - Mr Douglas Harris, the senior deputy
comptroller for capital markets, is a former employee of JP Morgan.
'We have the supervisory talent to understand what banks are doing,' he
says. The talent could be stretched if the dozen banks and securities firms
which dominate derivatives lost market share to other banks. In the short
term, he believes the high costs of entry are likely to prevent this.
A second pressing question for the OCC - founded by Abraham Lincoln to
accompany the formation of nationally chartered banks - is whether it will
continue to exist. Mr Ludwig is a firm believer that the time for a single
banking supervisor - such as a Federal Banking Commission - is long
over-due.
'Britain gets along quite well with one bank supervisor, so what is the
reason to have four?' he asks.
Mr Ludwig argues that the system creates uncertainty and excessive costs for
the banks. 'Banks deal in real time, but it can take them years to get
answers from supervisors,' he says. In one case, a compromise deal between
supervisors led to the doubling of reporting requirements on banks.
If Mr Ludwig has his way in reforming the structure of US bank regulation,
the antiquated title of Comptroller of the Currency may soon be consigned to
history. It will happen in an era of immense change for banking supervision,
not only within the US, but across global financial markets.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Quality v quantity in investment
decisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRIS WAITES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your reports on the Confederation of British Industry survey into
companies' investment appraisal methods focus on the widespread use of
high-hurdle rates and/or rapid pay-back periods ('CBI survey fuels
'short-termism' debate', July 25). Bank of England governor Eddie George and
others have suggested that these methods are preventing worthwhile
investment opportunities from being pursued and constraining economic
recovery. As highlighted at a recent conference sponsored jointly by the
Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, the real issue may be more about the
quality of the investment decision-making process rather than the quantum of
the output.
Where hurdle rates are set at levels well above the cost of capital, the
rationale is generally to provide an arbitrary margin for risk. This
approach may or may not be limiting the quantity of investment that is
taking place. Some secure, but unspectacular, projects will be rejected in
favour of much more speculative ventures that offer the uncertain prospect
of a rapid pay-back.
It must be better to allow for risk in a calculated manner than to seek
crude protection through artificially high discount rates. There is little
doubt that the quality of investment decisions would be significantly
enhanced by the adoption of a more rigorous approach to the identification
and analysis of risk, which would enable lower hurdle rates to be employed.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: No place for philanthropy in
provision of share options for executives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GEOFF LINDEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The subject of executive compensation in general and share option
schemes in particular is characterised by an excess of emotion and a dearth
of logic. Sadly, some of the comments quoted in your article about Dorling
Kindersley's unusual share option scheme are very muddled ('Publisher shares
his wealth at the office', July 26). What Peter Kindersley has chosen to do
is to make a gift to a number of senior executives of the company of which
he is by far the largest shareholder.
There could be only two possible explanations for his behaviour: either
philanthropy or the belief that this action will enhance the loyalty and
motivation of these executives. Whichever reason applies, Mr Kindersley has
chosen to bear all the dilution himself and he is, of course, perfectly
entitled to make this decision. Mr Kindersley's suggestion that institutions
wrongly believe that share option schemes are 'some sort of dilution' is
odd. Share options very definitely involve a form of dilution and, before
permitting their holdings to be diluted, institutional investors have a
legal obligation, no less, to think very seriously about the issues
involved.
Trustees of pension schemes have a fiduciary duty to their beneficiaries and
their investment managers, as their agents, have the same duty. Thus
philanthropic gestures by institutional investors towards key executives
simply cannot be contemplated.
The only grounds upon which institutional investors can contemplate the
dilution of their shareholding is if they believe that this action will
produce behaviour which is likely at the very least to compensate for that
dilution.
That is precisely why the NAPF, in conjunction with the Association of
British Insurers, issued its share scheme guidance which requires
performance criteria in share option schemes which will engender a
coincidence of interest between investors and management.
Furthermore, by being non-prescriptive the guidance deliberately empowers
remuneration committees to identify the performance criteria which they
believe are appropriate and, I earnestly hope, to articulate to investors
why these criteria are appropriate.
There is one area where I personally feel useful dialogue between industry
and investors could be opened. If executives could be encouraged through
liberalisation of the amount, phasing and timing of options to retain their
shares rather than selling them immediately after the exercise of their
options they would be welcome converts to the spirit of long-termism which
most institutions practise. It seems to me that such liberalisation might
well be to the advantage of both shareholders and management.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Time to stop shooting the investment
regulator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Alison Smith ('Life with a frisky watchdog', July 23/24) provides a
useful summary of the current debate about the regulated product environment
and the new, and now official, Personal Investment Authority.
However, gripes about today's practice of regulation and doubts about the
future effectiveness of the PIA miss the fundamental point, that the primary
objective - stronger investor protection - is now being achieved in the UK
for two clear reasons.
First, the balance of risk (and the need for protection implies the presence
of risk) is moving away from the buying public. Once upon a time they were
overly exposed, being expected to comprehend complex financial products and
cope with the super salesforces trying to push them. Now, as the pendulum
swings towards the supply side, businesses have realised that core income
streams are at risk if laws are broken. Under the new equilibrium, corporate
finance will suffer, rather than personal finance.
Second, the subject of compliance risk management is now firmly on the
agenda in many boardrooms. That will lead to better governance and therefore
better 'balanced' performance of investment business in the future,
restoring confidence in a vital sector of the economy.
The PIA still has work to do to come to terms with the spectrum of risk
which it now oversees for private investors. But far from firing shots at
the new regulator as it takes to the air (even if it isn't the most
aerodynamic vessel and has only mere humans at the controls), surely the
time has come to wish all concerned a safe and pleasant flight.

Sir, Helen Chadwick is 'witty', says your correspondent, Antony Thorncroft
(Arts: 'In praise of a joyful return to the basics', July 23/24). A woman
who urinates in the snow and calls it art . . . is 'witty'?
Call me old-fashioned, call me blinkered, repressed, or unimaginative, but I
don't regard urinating in snow as witty, nor is it art. It is most probably
a public health risk, or the act of someone with limited bladder control. If
you disagree with me then please attempt your own witticism at the desk of
your local constabulary and let me know of the resulting critical acclaim.
Sorry, Mr Thorncroft, but to borrow from the Financial Times' cartoonist,

FT  29 JUL 94 / You pay the money and take your choice: John Willman argues
for more variety, not cuts, in UK public services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lenin wanted to abolish it. John Major says that he will shrink it. No US
president can get elected without promising to get it off people's backs.
'It' is the state. And on Wednesday, Mr Major told the European Policy Forum
in London that his ambition was to limit its role.
Despite his good intentions, the UK prime minister is unlikely to be any
more successful than other western leaders in cutting government down to
size. Using public expenditure as a measure, the state is bigger now in
almost every country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development than it was 10 years ago.
Even where bits of the UK state have been sold off, most remain umbilically
tied to the public sector. Privatised utilities such as electricity and
water are largely controlled by government-appointed regulators. British
Rail, which is in the process of being privatised, will depend on public
subsidy for the foreseeable future.
Far from shrinking, the state is becoming more dominant in the economy.
Businesses from pharmaceuticals to broadcasting operate in a world where the
regulator giveth and the regulator taketh away.
The defence industry has long wallowed in the warm bath of government
contracts. Now the financial services industry is being co-opted into
providing pensions, while the City finances public infrastructure and social
housing.
There are no signs that the state's appetite will diminish, or that voters'
demands for it to provide ever-better public services will abate. Rather
than promising downsizing, Mr Major would have been better advised to
concentrate on the sort of state he wanted to provide. There is a gulf
between the Conservatives and the Labour party on that issue, and some
achievements for the government to brag about.
The public services that the Conservatives inherited in 1979 offered a
standard product, on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. Like the model-T Ford, you
could choose any colour so long as it was black.
That was fine in the early days of the welfare state, when people were
grateful for free education, a National Health Service and modern council
homes to replace slums. But, like car-buyers, their aspirations have been
raised.
Now they want to be able to choose between different options in public
services, just as they can in their private consumption. The Conservatives
have recognised this in many of their public service reforms, breaking up
monolithic institutions like the health service and local education
authorities. Instead, competing hospitals, schools, colleges and housing
associations offer a variety of choices.
There is not a completely free choice, of course. There never is. If you
want to buy a washing machine, they are all pretty much the same apart from
colour and size. And while most families have a car with four wheels and an
engine, not everyone can choose a Rolls-Royce.
But people using public services have some element of choice where there was
none before. Public service managers have been given greater freedom to
respond to what the customer wants and incentives to encourage them to do
so.
Labour still seems ambivalent about this. It worries about some people
losing out by making the wrong choices, and that inequalities will result.
It opposes the internal market in the health service, saying that
competition there is inappropriate. It says that the GP-fundholding scheme,
which allows family doctors to shop around for the best treatment on behalf
of their patients, is creating a two-tier service. It promises to bring all
state schools back under local authority control. Local authorities would
again begin building homes for rent.
It is true that some people will make bad decisions, and the middle classes
will find ways of getting more than a fair share. The organisations
providing the services may be tempted to cream off the best customers,
leaving the most vulnerable in sink schools or with the worst doctors.
But these things happen already. High-quality, free state education is
available to those who can afford to move into the right school catchment
areas. Articulate folk have always known how to argue their way to the head
of any queue. They already benefit disproportionately from the welfare
state.
However, it is not beyond the wit of policymakers to devise systems that
stop some people hogging the resources. Giving extra payments to public
services which provide for those who need them most would counteract
cream-skimming. More information and advice may be needed if people are not
to make foolish choices.
And there are opportunities for a left-of-centre party to build on the
Conservative reforms in order to advance its egalitarian agenda. Parties
like Labour were created to give ordinary people access to opportunities
reserved for the privileged. Further extending choice in public services
would contribute to that end.
For example, why should the best services in health and education be
reserved for those who can pay for them? This, more than public service
reforms, creates a two-tier society. The existence of private markets in
health and education creates an 'opt-out' society in which a few can buy the
standard of service that many more desire.
Those private markets cannot be abolished in a free society. But they could
be integrated into the public sector if the state bought in their services
so that everyone had access to them. Giving people vouchers to buy their own
health and education would further enhance choice, and force schools and
health organisations to meet users' needs.
Some of Labour's policy advisers have been pressing the party's strategists
to develop the Conservative reforms, not reverse them. Having studied the
reforms in the health service and education, they have seen gains in
efficiency and responsiveness.
Luckily for Mr Major, Labour shows no signs of listening to such voices. So
this allows him to present the Conservatives at the next election as the
party that believes in real choice in public services, and Labour as a party
that appears not to.
If he wants to put clear water between the government and the opposition, Mr
Major should say less about the doomed objective of reducing the state, and
more about making it provide the sort of services that voters aspire to.

Welcome back Tights, Camera, Action, the series devoted to dance. (Channel 4
at 8pm). This is an art form not often well served by television but by
cramming in three short dances in half an hour you certainly get variety.
Choreographers and dancers come from Canada, France and the UK, and some of
the works have been commissioned by Channel 4.
Men's magazines have come down from the top shelf in recent years, and
although selling less than a tenth of the numbers of comparable womens'
magazines they bring in the advertising and often do well. For Men Only (BBC
2 at 7.50) betrays its origins - it was commissioned by BBC Wales - but
nicely examines the blossoming world of GQ, Arena, Esquire and FHM.
Friday night is gardening night - and why not? Garden Club (Channel 4 at
9pm) returns for a nine-week run and for once follows rather than clashes
with BBC 2's Gardener's World, which starts at 8.30.
For folkies, Loudon and Co at 11.30 on BBC 2 is a must. The man is a melodic
maverick and among his guests tonight is James Taylor.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Arts: The Lady from the Sea - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the Lyric Hammersmith we have one of the least manageable later Ibsen
plays, The Lady from the Sea. Brave and interesting, this co-production with
West Yorkshire Playhouse scores only a qualified success. If you saw the
Royal Exchange version with Vanessa Redgrave 15 years ago, in Manchester or
at the Roundhouse in London, you may stay home in good conscience; if not,
the Lyric staging has its rewards for Ibsen devotees (until August 27).
This 1888 play came between Rosmersholm and Hedda Gabler. Like them, it has
an anguished heroine at its centre - but where those other heroines are
anchored (or trapped) in concrete situations, the 'lady from the sea' floats
free of anything concrete; her obsessions are private and deeply fey.
Ibsen lays on the symbolism hard. Ellida grew up in a lighthouse on the open
sea (now she lives at the dull end of a fjord, wedded to an older widower);
her disordered thoughts return constantly to the wild waves, and to her
fateful encounter with a foreign sailor; she has almost withdrawn from real
life, and from her two stepdaughters who supply the echoing sub-plots. The
play works up slowly to its climactic event, the reappearance of the
romantic sailor to claim his mystical bride and Ellida's dramatic
re-assessment of her situation.
Lindsay Posner's production has apt, intimately impassioned music by Paddy
Cuneen, of the Cheek by Jowl company, and a bold set by Tim Hatley: a
looming assemblage of sea-smoothed rocks overhead, and beneath it nothing
but a steeply raked floor, upon which items of furniture turn up as needed
for the domestic scenes. At the final liberation, the stones lift away (as
far as the Lyric's flytower will permit). We lose, however, any visible
sense of the practical, provincial reality which is Ellida's lot.
Ibsen insisted that we must never glimpse the 'open sea', but Hatley's
designs look open as could be - we had not expected, after all, to see
painted waves on the backcloth. It is left to the actors to mime the
confinement of their frustrating lives amid this unconfined space, which
they do with varying degrees of conviction. The stepdaughters manage nicely.
Though Emily Watson plays the younger Hilde insufferably pert, she remembers
just in time to register deep feeling at Ellida's return.
Matilda Ziegler brings a curious whining drawl to Bolette, the elder, but
also exact representations of Bolette's moods - resigned, suddenly hopeful,
delighted, bereft. But the moods succeed one another with disconcerting
speed; and for that, I think, the director is to blame - for he has done the
same with Ellida herself, and with her patient husband Dr Wangel (Pip
Donaghy).
In Wangel's case, he blows hot, cold and judiciously concerned from moment
to moment, and Josette Simon's Ellida veers still less predictably. Miss
Simon is not only black but strikingly close-cropped, which makes her an
exotic figure in 19th-century Norway; and why not? Her special virtues,
however, are meaningful stillness and fraught grace - whereas Ibsen puts his
heroine through mood-switches which may seem quite crazy, as too often they
do here, if not underpinned by a palpably consistent character.
Still, Miss Simon has some noble moments. And among the secondary leads, the
swains of (respectively) Hilde and Bolette are engagingly natural: Paul
Higgins' would-be artist Lyngstrand dreams of a Southern career, enhanced by
Hilde's constant prayers from a safe distance, and Sean Baker's dry,
disappointed Arnholm - Bolette's ex-tutor - faces up to a late, uncertain
marriage.
Here the director's heavy hand intrudes. It is quite clear to him, though it
should not be to us, that her choice amounts to a sacrifice. Ibsen's claim
is that because it is chosen freely it is no sacrifice, just like Ellida's
final resolve. Much stress is laid upon Bolette's disheartened fate, when
Ibsen intended nothing so unambiguous. Contrariwise, Ellida's sailor - the
Stranger - is described as Finnish, and always referred to as 'the
American', but arrives in the unmistakeably Irish person of Liam de Staic.
From Peter Kelly there is a pleasant sketch of a typical Ibsen oddity, the
artist/horn-player/hairdresser Ballested. His theatrical troupe collapsed in
this little town, and he has lived there ever since. But we never really
learn where 'there' was: a pity, because Ibsen's most visionary flights
always start from tough, pragmatic bases.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Arts: Bernard Delfont - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The death, at the age of 84, of Lord (Bernard) Delfont, marks the passing of
one of the two Grand Old Men of the British entertainment industry - the
other is his brother Lord (Lew) Grade, still going strong at 87.
Between them these two Russian born sons of the formidable Olga, and Isaac,
Winogradsky, established, with brother Leslie, a 50 year dominance over
every aspect of the nation's leisure activities, from the music halls
through to television, where their influence lives on in Leslie's son,
Michael Grade, the controller of Channel 4.
Bernie Delfont, a tall, handsome man well into his eighties, with a mane of
silvery hair, never stopped working. He was well into his seventies when he
acquired First Leisure, with its interests in discos, bowling and much of
Blackpool, and he was an active president of the company at his death.
Like brother Lew, Lord Delfont began as a professional Charleston dancer but
soon found being an agent a more profitable business. From there it was a
short step into owning theatres and cinemas and his long reign as King of
British show business.
It was Bernard Delfont who produced the Royal Variety Show for 25 years. He
managed home grown stars, like Morecambe and Wise, and brought over big
foreign names like Maurice Chevalier and Lena Horne. He became a force in
the movie and record businesses when the Grade Organisation was sold to EMI
and then became its chief executive.
Every time Lord Delfont was ejected by young Turks he bounced back, and it
was his experience that guided First Leisure to success. Despite the
inevitable cigars, he was never a great showman. He was not a discoverer of
new talent or an inspired creator, or even a friend of the avant-garde: he
was the businessman, with his finger on the pulse of public taste, whose
main interest in the theatre was that night's take at the box office.
Sometimes his judgment wavered - he turned down the chance to manage the
Beatles - and he rejected an investment in Monty Python's Life of Brian
because he thought it blasphemous - but he was known as a considerate
employer, a generous supporter of good causes, and a throughly old fashioned
gentleman. Even his 'vice' was excusable - he was a keen racing man who once
owned a string of horses. His only hobby was watching the racing on
television spiced by a few bets.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Arts: A Ring with colour-coded leitmotifs - Alfred
Kirchner's new production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BAYREUTH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Half a cheer for the new Ring at Bayreuth. It is abstract, colourful and
apolitical - a bigger contrast with its predecessor, the 1988 Kupfer
production, is hard to imagine. The stage direction is minimal, the costumes
are a riot. James Levine has inspired the festival orchestra to play with a
tonal ripeness and clarity unsurpassed in a generation, but his tempi -
although marvellously consistent - have been rather stately. These are early
days. Das Rheingold and Die Walkure have just been unveiled in conditions of
sweltering heat, but with no apparent hiccups. Siegfried follows this
afternoon and Gotterdammerung on Sunday.
The producer, Alfred Kirchner, and his designer, known only as Rosalie, came
with a reputation for radical ideas, but their approach has been
surprisingly anodyne. Kirchner, an experienced theatre director in Berlin
and Vienna, made his breakthrough in opera more than a decade ago during the
Gielen years at Frankfurt. In interviews before the first night, he rejected
the idea of tying Wagner's tetralogy to a particular time or philosophy. His
aim, he said, was simply to find new mythical pictures for a many-sided
epic; to use the colours and materials of nature without implying
naturalism; and by unfolding the story without ideological baggage, to let
the audience draw its own conclusions. Admirable thoughts - and doubtless
the reason why Kirchner and Rosalie have been let off so lightly at their
curtain calls.
With decor reduced to a convex circular platform (the top of the globe),
augmented by a variety of geometrically arranged lights and panels, the
production focuses directly on words and music - providing you are not
distracted by the costumes. And there's the rub. A random collage of styles
and associations, they pretend to illustrate or comment on each character's
function in the drama, through colour-coding and other symbols. Freia
skitters about in a green-and-gold hooped outfit, apparently denoting youth
and fruitfulness. Fricka follows her straw dress in Rheingold with a bizarre
Cleopatra gown for Walkure - domesticity and regality. Sieglinde has an iron
collar, a symbol of bondage which she discards after doping Hunding.
Alberich sports shorts and a reptilian back-pack, like a friendly little
porcupine.
Others are harder to fathom. The Valkyries, for example, are lumbered with
outsize red-and-black pannier dresses. With rare exceptions - notably the
inhabitants of Nibelheim, a mass of wriggling worm-like robots - the
costumes are a phoney fashion-designer's caprice, reducing Wagner's
characters to figures of fun.
Take away the costumes, however, and you have no production. It must be a
long time since Bayreuth saw such poverty of theatrical imagination, such an
abdication of the stage director's role. Apart from a splendid whirl of
light-cylinders in the Ride of the Valkyries, Kirchner simply dumps his cast
centre-stage and, give or take a bit of posturing, leaves them to get on
with it. Even accounting for the difficulties of staging all four parts of
The Ring in one go, the dialogue is unbelievably limp, especially in the
crucial encounters of Die Walkure. The worst instance is the start of Act 2:
stranded on separate levels, Wotan and Brunnhilde barely begin to address
each other; the father-daughter relationship, with all its affectionate
playfulness, has to be taken as read. Of greed, lust and ambition, of sex
and violence, deceit and betrayal, this production offers barely a trace. We
are in a Wagnerian kindergarten, a world in which the Woodentops would feel
at home.
Just what Levine thinks of all this is the subject of much speculation.
Judging by the way he embraced Kirchner at their Walkure curtain call, he
would have us believe he endorses the approach. But given Levine's
conservative reputation, there must have been huge compromises. The stage
curtain, for example, remains closed throughout the prelude to each act -
unheard of in Germany today - and comes down again before the final
orchestral flourish, making for a strange anticlimax to the Walkure love
scene.
Levine's experience of conducting The Ring in New York pays notable
dividends. He brings out the natural character of the score, flawlessly
unfolding the structure and paragraphing, with the manifold cross-currents
and counterpoints coherently integrated. Das Rheingold was a revelation - so
much detail to enjoy, and the orchestra playing like angels. With Levine in
charge, the singers can do nothing but sing lyrically, enough to turn even
minor episodes like Froh's 'Wie liebliche Luft' into a hymn of joy. The
corollary, of course, is that the music lacks theatrical intensity -
particularly in Die Walkure. It is a symphonic reading, without the dramatic
extremes which made the Barenboim-Kupfer production so thrilling.
The biggest loser in the new Ring is John Tomlinson's Wotan. He is neutered
by a blue rubber skirt, and his Norman helmet shuts out facial expression.
There is little scope for him to show dignity or ruthlessness, and the
character fails to develop between Rheingold and Walkure. Even his handling
of the text has been smoothed over. With such a superficial dramatic
framework, the spotlight falls on his voice, which he hoists up heroically
but with some strain. He was unfairly booed.
Several others are inherited from previous casts - among them Siegfried
Jerusalem's harmless Loge, Manfred Jung's squawky Mime, Ekkehard Wlaschiha's
rich-toned Alberich and Hans Sotin's anonymous Hunding. Deborah Polaski
returns as Brunnhilde, her top as constricted as ever. Poul Elming's
Siegmund was in splendid voice, partnered now by his Danish compatriot Tina
Kiberg - who lends the production a welcome ray of femininity, even if she
lacks a Wagnerian voice. And there are two outstanding contributions: Hanna
Schwarz's majestic, mettlesome Fricka and Rene Pape's Fasolt, the only
singer to rise above his surroundings and provide the humanity sadly lacking
in this production so far.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Anita Roddick, one of the founders of The Body Shop, which has proved such a
success producing and marketing wittily-titled personal care products, has
decided it is time she changed her own title.
Yesterday the company said that in future she would hold the post of chief
executive and relinquish that of group managing director. Her husband,
Gordon, remains chairman.
A range of other bodies are also swapping seats at the company, including
three newly created executive directors, making a total of nine on the main
board.
Jane Reid, head of the legal department since October 1989, is made a
director, in charge of legal matters. Jeremy Kett, chief financial officer,
who joined in March 1990, becomes director responsible for finance. Terry
Hartin becomes director in charge of operations and distribution.
Stepping into the managing director's shoes is Stuart Rose, formerly
director responsible for corporate development.
Two other directors assume different responsibilities in the shuffle.
Michael Ross, once in charge of international retail, is now looking after
strategic retail projects, while Jilly Forster moves from looking after
communications to strategic marketing. The company says it is looking to
recruit a new person in charge of communications.
The change in Anita Roddick's title is 'a reflection of the business getting
bigger,' says a spokesman. 'She spends a lot of her time travelling and this
will relieve her of the day-to-day running of the business, in order to
concentrate more on its direction and style.'

FT  29 JUL 94 / People: Wilkinson is to be new managing director at Laird
Group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Geoffrey Wilkinson, 48, has been appointed managing director of the Laird
group, the vehicle components manufacturer, with effect from October, after
having joined the company in June 1993 as finance director.
His replacement as finance director will be Jonathan Silver, 36, currently
corporate development manager.
The moves follow on the announcement in April that the current chairman and
chief executive, John Gardiner, would become chairman solely, and that the
current managing director, Ian Arnott, 51, would be stepping into the role
of chief executive.
Gardiner will retire from the chief executive role on October 1, when the
other changes take effect.
Laird is by no means an unfamiliar company to Wilkinson - he first became
acquainted with the group when he worked for the Industrial Re-organisation
Corporation more than 20 years ago.
Wilkinson has been (successively) a former chief economist, financial
controller, and ultimately head of corporate mergers, investments and
divestments at British Steel.
He left British Steel in 1987 and spent several years with US investment
bank Dillon Read. In October 1991 he and David Prior established a
partnership, for a time working for Garry Klesch, who put up the equity for
a series of steel service sector buy-ins.
Silver, a chartered accountant, first worked for Thornton Baker before
joining Fisons, then moving on to Laird in 1986 as group management
accountant.
More than 80 per cent of Laird's profits derive from overseas markets. Its
last annual results showed pre-tax profits of Pounds 38.2m.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Technology: Brains on their minds - Drugs researchers are
seeking a stroke treatment that could transform current therapy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ask almost any doctor what drug treatments there are for strokes and they
will probably say 'none'. The reason lies in the nature of the condition. A
stroke occurs when the brain is damaged due to poor blood circulation. It
can happen quickly, even without warning. The brain is damaged within
minutes or hours, and all a doctor can do is try to help the patient
recover.
Stroke victims lose brain functions such as memory, speech or limb
co-ordination. As well as their distress and that of their families, the
cost to society is vast. About 500,000 people a year suffer from strokes in
the US. Only about a third of victims recover sufficient independence to
return to previous levels of activity. The rest require years of
rehabilitation and nursing. Some are permanently hospitalised.
The prospect of earning an enviable reputation and a great deal of money has
attracted many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to the area.
Success would transform stroke therapy. Today's preventative therapies would
be supplemented for the first time with patient treatment.
But the condition is complicated. About 85 per cent of strokes are caused by
blockages in blood vessels and are called ischaemic strokes. Without oxygen
carried by blood, cells die.
The remaining 15 per cent of strokes are caused by leakages of blood into
the brain - cerebral haemorrhages. The brain is squashed by the extra volume
of blood and cells die.
Doctors try to identify people who are at a high risk of either kind of
stroke and give appropriate preventative drugs. People with a history of
artery disease, for example, may be given mild blood-thinning agents such as
aspirin to ward off clots. People with high blood pressure have an increased
chance of a haemorrhage and can be treated with drugs for high blood
pressure.
After an ischaemic stroke, victims may be given stronger clot-busting drugs
such as streptokinase to try to clear the blockage quickly. In cerebral
haemorrhages, blood thinners and clot busters are precisely what must not be
administered as they would increase the blood flow to the brain. After the
stroke, only risky brain surgery can help.
Modern research on drugs that might effectively treat stroke victims begins
by analysing the biochemistry of the condition: what chemical events take
place between blood flow disruption and cell death?
Unfortunately, biochemists cannot yet provide a complete answer. What is
understood so far is that when blood is cut off from brain cells, chemicals
called excitatory amino acids are released.
These bind to receptors on brain cells and open channels into the cell.
Through the open channels flow large amounts of calcium and sodium which can
kill the cell simply by bursting it. The calcium and sodium are also
involved in reactions inside the cell which release poisons such as nitric
oxide, highly reactive substances called free radicals and even
protein-eating enzymes that can digest the cell from the inside.
As if that were not enough, the inflow of calcium is a trigger for the
release of more excitatory amino acids and the whole lethal sequence spreads
out from the original core of damage.
'There is almost an active progression of damage going on for minutes, even
hours, after the stroke,' says John Reid of Glasgow University's department
of medicine and therapeutics. Within a few hours, the dead core is
surrounded by a larger area of dying cells, he says.
So a candidate drug treatment is one that blocks either the release or the
action of the excitatory amino acids. The principle is to freeze the process
that leads to the death of the cells until normal blood circulation is
restored through the action of clot-busting drugs.
But the lack of complete biochemical understanding means the practice is
more difficult. There is more than one excitatory amino acid, several ways
of obstructing each and yet further ways of dealing with their effects. On
top of that, interfering with the functioning of brain cells can cause
unpleasant side effects such as hallucination.
The first drug likely to reach the market is expected to be launched in the
next few months. Called Freedox, it was developed by Upjohn of the US. It
tackles some of the last stages in the sequence of cell death - for example,
by inhibiting the free radicals.
Initially it will be licensed for use in haemorrhages only. Further clinical
trials are under way in patients with ischaemia and with victims of head and
spine injuries that can trigger a similar sequence leading to cell death.
At the other end of the biochemical sequence, Wellcome, the UK company, is
researching a drug called 619C89 which is designed to prevent the release of
the most important of the excitatory amino acids, glutamate. The drug is
about to enter further clinical trials and is unlikely to be on the market
before the end of the decade.
Ciba, the Swiss drugs company, is a little further advanced with its
Selfotel drug, which blocks the action of glutamate rather than its
production.
Selfotel is entering the last and biggest series of trials that must be
undertaken for any drug is approved. If all goes well, a product could be on
the market in three or four years, says Beatrix Maurice-Schubiger, head of
Ciba's central nervous system product management.
Unfortunately, Selfotel has side-effects including hallucination, paranoia
and confusion. In May, Ciba signed a collaborative deal with California
biotechnology company Cocensys to research a second stroke drug. Acea 1021
works by a quite different mechanism, blocking another of the receptors for
excitatory amino acids. Maurice-Schubiger says that Acea 1021 is 'about two
years behind Selfotel' in the development process.
Improving on Selfotel is also a target for Massachusetts biotechnology
company Cambridge Neuro-Science. It has a drug called Cerestat which blocks
a different receptor for excitatory amino acids. Elkan Gamzu, the company's
president, claims that Cerestat is as good as Selfotel but avoids the
side-effects.
But Cerestat has only just completed initial trials, so even if all goes
well a product is unlikely to reach the market until the next decade.
Other companies researching the area include the UK's Wellcome and Fisons,
Switzerland's Sandoz, France's Synthelabo and US biotechnology companies
Alkermes, Guilford, Gensia, Pharmos and Cephalon.
In spite of the large amount of research activity, some scientists fear that
no one solution will work well. There are at least 22 separate steps in the
biochemistry of cell death and it is not known which, if any, could stall
the whole process.
Drug developers have recently witnessed an unpleasant precedent in the
treatment of septic shock. Both stroke and septic shock involve complicated
cascades of biochemical events. In septic shock, each of the drugs developed
seemed to be effective in blocking part of the cascade, but each so far has
failed to prevent the disease progressing.
Behind the optimistic words, the industry is aware of this potential
problem. Merck of the US, the world's biggest drug company, abandoned work
on its candidate stroke drug MK 801. Executives at Upjohn concede that they
do not know exactly how Freedox works. Gamzu admits that Cerestat acts on
only one of several receptors involved in stroke.
Ralph White, central nervous system project manager at Wellcome, sums up the
view of many when he says: 'We won't know if a drug really works until we've
finished the last clinical trial.'

FT  29 JUL 94 / Property: Nervous investors
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Total returns from commercial property investments continued to slide in
June as investors remained nervous about the direction of interest rates and
the lack of any serious recovery in rents, according to Independent Property
Databank, a research group.
The IPD index of monthly total returns fell in June to 0.9 per cent, the
lowest level for 12 months and the third consecutive monthly fall.
Retail provided the only encouraging news with total returns rising to 1.4
per cent from 1.2 per cent in May. Total returns from offices fell from 1
per cent to 0.3 per cent and industrial property returns fell from 1.4 per
cent to 1 per cent.
The declines reflect the concerns of a jittery market with funds unlikely to
increase investment until rents start to catch up with previous sharp rises
in capital values of buildings.
The increase in total returns from retail investments was prompted by a 0.2
per cent rise in shop rents last month, the first increase recorded by IPD
since December 1991.
Rents for office and industrial properties continued to fall but at a much
slower rate, indicating that rental decline may be coming to an end. Overall
rents failed to move last month.
Capital values are continuing to stagnate; for offices they declined by 0.4
per cent in June, the first monthly fall since May last year.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Property: Double act - A bid to tap private funds for public
projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW RUSSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'By private finance, we don't mean paying an inflated price for blue-chip
guaranteed loans. We mean putting the private sector in the driving seat,
bearing and managing the large risks which capital projects entail. Too much
of government has traditionally been the patsy customer in public projects.'
Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor, speaking of the Private Finance Initiative, a
government scheme to attract private investment to public sector projects,
launched in 1992.
Mr Clarke's words were fine. But the Private Finance Initiative has failed
to enthuse the private sector. As a result, the Department of Environment
and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors have appointed Chesterton
Consulting, surveyors, to assess how PFI could be revived, especially to aid
small projects valued at Pounds 5m-Pounds 60m.
More than half the 78 projects listed in 1992 as examples of potential PFI
ventures remain on the drawing board. Many of the rest pre-dated the PFI
launch in any case. One flagship project, CrossRail - a Pounds 2bn line
linking east and west London - was struck a blow in May when MPs blocked a
private bill authorising construction. Although the government has revived
the venture through a complex parliamentary procedure, it says the project
will take at least 10 years to complete.
However, the critics' main contention - that PFI has failed to provoke
interest, such as on CrossRail - may be misplaced.
One reason is that, as in any big civil engineering venture, the lead-time
for projects can typically be two years or more. Many of the original
projects associated with PFI, such as CrossRail and Heathrow Express, are
large, with a long gestation period which critics have misinterpreted as
evidence of lack of activity.
In addition, in spite of the government's more enlightened vision about the
role of the private sector, public resources remain as tightly controlled as
previously (especially when placed alongside private-sector resources in a
joint venture).
The government can borrow money more cheaply than the private sector and
therefore in absolute terms it is rarely possible to prove that a
partnership with the private sector provides better value.
PFI modifies this strict 'value for money' test in subtle ways. The extra
cost of private money is now seen by government as being justified where its
use brings associated advantages, such as the transfer of risk away from the
public sector and access to better management.
It is possible, though, to conceive of other benefits from the use of
private finance, ranging from the fact that without it, a project could not
proceed, to intangible spin-offs such as an improved environment.
The most obvious area of application for PFI principles is in the provision
of transport infrastructure. However, few groups are capable of financing
such schemes, and many observers believe that the real challenge for public
and private sectors is to make PFI work with 'smaller' projects, valued at
between Pounds 5m (for a school) and Pounds 60m (a prison).
One reason for caution may be that the DoE - one of the UK's biggest
sponsors of construction - is uncertain whether PFI changes anything at all.
The ground-rules implicit in Mr Clarke's quotation is that government
contribution to any partnership must have a ceiling. Once that concept is
introduced, the public investment assumes the nature of a grant. Many a
recent public-sector grant could easily have been re-sprayed in PFI colours.
However, DoE-sponsored projects differ in one important respect from those
backed by other departments. A high proportion involve helping
private-sector investments get off the ground, creating jobs and other
benefits. In contrast, projects sponsored by other departments involve
facilities for which the government is the only customer, such as prisons,
higher education etc. It is in this area of public services that PFI is
likely to enjoy most success.
Where PFI is likely to meet with least success is in encouraging the private
sector to come up with its own ideas. In spite of the government's expressed
willingness to negotiate with a single private-sector promoter, PFI is
caught in public procurement rules and, in particular, by EC requirements
that contracts should be tendered. Private companies have better things to
do than invest their time and money in new ideas if they then have to
compete for the privilege of carrying them out.
The government seems to be heading once again for the role of patsy
customer. Although the private sector assumes risk, the perception remains
that as the government guarantees the income-stream, it is therefore
gilt-edged. On the other hand, the mechanism undoubtedly gives rise to a
greater range of investments than could ever be financed through taxation.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Technology: Matchmaking trap for woodworms - Worth Watching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Buying a house can be a risky business and many purchasers err on the side
of caution and spray for woodworm whether or not an infestation exists,
writes Daniel Green. But from next year, it should be easier to discover if
there is a true problem.
A UK company, Oxford Asymmetry, has developed a way to mass-produce woodworm
pheromones, the sex hormone that brings male and female woodworms together.
Scientists at Oxford University divided the structure of the hormone and
Oxford Asymmetry built a synthetic chemical 'scaffold' around which
identical molecules would form in its laboratories.
The company has now signed an agreement with Cardiff-based Agrisense which
will market a woodworm trap: the idea is that new homeowners first test for
the presence of woodworm before committing themselves to the dirt and
expense of pest control.

Detecting sources of heat is an important aspect of fire fighting and
prevention. Product Innovation has designed a hand-held device which emits
visual and audible signals to detect heat sources as a relatively low-cost
addition to the available equipment.
The Hotspotter sensor detects infra-red waves, which are converted into
sounds and lights by a microprocessor. The intensity of the heat is
indicated by the frequency of the sound and the colour of the light.
The uses of the Hotspotter include locating the source of a fire through
dense smoke and spotting a potential fire risk. The device costs Pounds 120.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Technology: Breast cancer under the needle - Worth Watching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Women with suspected breast cancer usually undergo surgical biopsies, which
can leave scarring. A technique based on technology developed for Nasa's
Hubble space telescope allows the biopsy to be performed with a needle
rather than a scapel, leaving a small puncture wound rather than a scar.
The technique allows the abnormality to be located by an X-ray imaging
device which takes digital images of the suspected mass from two different
angles. A computer calculates the co-ordinates of the abnormality, after
which the sample is extracted with a needle.
X-rays have been used before to locate suspected abnormalities. However, the
time needed to take the pictures, develop the film and locate the
co-ordinates of the abnormal tissue method takes about 15-20 minutes. The
digital imaging device is quicker, gives a higher-quality image and exposes
patients to half the radiation of the conventional X-ray method.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Technology: Putting the brakes on skidding - Worth Watching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A system to help prevent cars from skidding has been developed by Bosch, the
German electronic and vehicle parts manufacturer.
Its Vehicle Dynamics Control system depends on sensors which measure the
rate at which the car is turning its vertical axis, together with the car's
lateral acceleration, steering angle, wheel speeds and braking pressure.
These sensors feed information to an electronic control unit which is able
to compare the requested steering angle with the actual course of the
vehicle. The system then corrects any error in the car's course by braking
the appropriate wheel.
The system is designed to be used in conjunction with anti-lock braking
systems, which intervene when a wheel is about to lock during braking and
traction control, which prevents the wheels from slipping during
acceleration.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Management: Insider on the outside - Otto Lambsdorff
explains his zeal for reform of German boardrooms to Michael Lindemann and
David Waller
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN and DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Otto Lambsdorff has every reason to feel dejected. For 20 years he has
campaigned to shake up the boardrooms of leading German companies and to
disentangle the complicated web of cross-shareholdings that dominate and -
critics argue - deaden the German economy.
On the face of it, Lambsdorff, economics spokesman for the Free Democratic
Party and chairman of DSW, Germany's largest small shareholder association,
has had little success. Large-scale cross-shareholdings remain the norm in
German industry, preventing hostile takeovers and stunting the growth of the
stock market which is playing an increasingly important role in other
leading economies worldwide.
The 67-year-old, who was economics minister from 1974 to 1984, remains
undaunted. His campaigning has earned him a reputation as one of the most
eloquent speakers on the workings of the German economy and he is convinced
that he is making inroads. He points out, for instance, that a new law will
oblige banks and companies to declare any shareholdings above 5 per cent
that they hold in other companies.
But Lambsdorff wants to go further. Cross-ownership of the sort that exists
in Germany is forbidden in many countries and, while achieving a similar ban
may be impossible, more must be done to reduce the web.
'If you look at what the big German banks, taken together, control - the
shareholdings themselves, the supervisory board seats, the proxy voting
rights - then it amounts to a concentration of economic power and influence
which is largely beyond the reach of any outside control and which can lead
to dangerous developments and abuse of power,' Lambsdorff says.
His favourite bugbear is Westdeutsche Landesbank, the state-owned
Dusseldorf-based bank, which Lambsdorff says calls the tune in the state of
North Rhine-Westphalia.
He singles it out as a particularly offensive example of a state-owned
institution where there is an all too cosy relationship between the state's
Social Democratic government, the Federation of German Unions and local
industry. 'They buy shareholdings in industry the way other people collect
pictures or stamps,' he says.
The recent near collapse of Metallgesellschaft, the metals, mining and
industrial group, is a good example of how the banks, with their large
stakes in the company and their positions on the group's supervisory board,
were unable to prevent a debacle, he says.
The Frankfurt-based group lost DM1.9bn (Pounds 780m) to end-September 1993
and warned it will lose a similar amount for the 1994 financial year, its
losses triggered by speculative trading in the US oil futures markets. It is
in the throes of a drastic restructuring which involves cutting the
workforce to one-third of the 60,000 people employed 18 months ago. The
reorganised group will have turnover of DM14bn, little more than half last
year's levels.
Lambsdorff is dismissive of the big German banks' claims that they have
provided a heroic service to the German economy by rescuing
Metallgesellschaft (they were the biggest contributors to the DM3.4bn rescue
package agreed in January).
'The mistake was not in the way that the group was rescued - but rather that
one allowed the situation to arise. First you drive the car against the wall
and then you hope to rescue your reputation by going to a good garage.'
Other recent cases, including the Jurgen Schneider bankruptcy and alleged
fraud at Balsam, a German sports-floorings manufacturer, and Procedo, the
biggest factoring company in Germany and biggest creditor to Balsam, reflect
bad management at the banks, Lambsdorff says. 'A series of large
bankruptcies like this damages the reputation of the German banks on the
international capital markets,' he warns.
The second Finanz-marktforderungsgesetz, or financial markets promotion law,
which is set to come into force next week, may do something to redress the
imbalance by making the corporate landscape more transparent, Lambsdorff
argues. For example, companies will be forced to declare any shareholdings
in other companies once they exceed 5 per cent, an improvement on the
previous 25 per cent threshold.
Supervisory boards - the non-executive bodies made up of shareholders and
workers' representatives - also need reform if they are to play a useful
role, he says. In 1965 a law limited the number of supervisory boards an
individual could sit on. Now, Lambsdorff argues, it is necessary to limit
the size of the supervisory boards.
Some of Germany's largest company boards - such as Volkswagen, where
Lambsdorff is a supervisory board member - have 20 members, making them
unwieldy. Critics allege that membership is often based less on professional
competence than on political favouritism, while the annual fees paid to
supervisory board members (average DM8,000) are too low to provide incentive
for full involvement.
Supervisory board members need more direct contact with company accountants
and the accountants should have extensive powers to sit in at important
company meetings, he argues. Current arrangements mean that contact between
the two parties is channelled through the company management - the people
the supervisory board is there to oversee.
Some argue that Lambsdorff may not be an ideal campaigner for the reform of
supervisory boards. He sits on eight belonging to larger, listed companies
and on a host of other smaller ones. He replies: 'I'm an insider critic.
That makes me even more difficult for them.'

FT  29 JUL 94 / Management: Innovation along simple lines - Book Review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are two ways in which a company can create more value for its
shareholders, apart from the defeatist route of selling out. In the short
term, it can put itself on a slimming course by removing management layers,
'downsizing' its organisation and reconfiguring from scratch - or
're-engineering' - the main processes by which it operates.
But unless it wants to die of eventual corporate anorexia, it must also do
some bodybuilding. That means growing its existing businesses, acquiring new
ones or creating them from within.
After five years or more of painful slimming and 25 years of trouble with
growth-by-acquisition, it is not surprising that many companies are turning
their attention to internal business development. For the first time in a
decade, a renewed wave of interest in creativity and innovation is in the
making.
So a book which sets out to demonstrate 'how leadership and drive create
commercial innovations that sweep the world' is both timely and welcome,
especially when it does so through a collection of 14 case studies of a
warts-and-all nature. Creativity and innovation are untidy processes, yet
they are usually presented as sanitised hero stories from which all the
actual messiness has been removed.
Breakthroughs]*, written by P. Ranganath Nayak and John M. Ketteringham from
Arthur D. Little, the US technology-based consultancy, makes a virtue of
that untidiness. As the authors say, its stories reveal 'the creativity and
cursedness, the politics and persistence, the determination and the dumb
luck' involved in such radical innovations as JVC's video cassette recorder,
Sony's Walkman, Raytheon's microwave oven, Nike shoes, Nautilus fitness
machines, Club Med holiday centres, and Philips/Sony compact discs.
The last two examples have been added, along with some useful general
analysis, since the book was first published in 1986, when the ground was
less fertile for its message.
Unlike 3M's peel-off Post-it notes, Fred Smith's Federal Express courier
empire, and Toyota's 'supermarket for cars' (its famous just-in-time
production system), not all the stories in the book have happy endings.
EMI was unable, through a string of bad luck and strategic misjudgments, to
turn its body scanner into a thriving worldwide business; its larger rivals
did so instead.
Raytheon's pioneering 'black magic' microwave oven development in the 1950s
was overtaken by more innovative and marketing-aware Japanese companies
(although the US group had the sense to buy into one of them).
But, happy or otherwise, the 14 case studies share several common threads,
according to Arthur D. Little. Some are obvious, such as the importance of
teamwork. The initial spark for a new concept is usually created by a
technical or commercial inventor using what Arthur Koestler called
'bisociative thinking' (reassembling known elements in new patterns). But he
or she is only the first link in the organisational chain.
Some of Arthur D. Little's other conclusions are more controversial:
That many breakthrough innovations - as many as half - come from large
companies rather than small ones.
That successful breakthroughs are often technology-pushed, not market-led.
This is a deeply unfashionable view, albeit natural for a high-tech
consultancy.
That commercial breakthroughs do not require a special company climate -
though it helps. This conclusion is both inconsistent with some of the
book's data and perverse: Arthur D. Little may be right that breakthroughs
'can emerge from any environment', hostile or friendly. The question is
which type of organisation produces more of them.
The book is also at fault in its dogmatic and misleading distinction between
breakthroughs and innovation. Breakthroughs are indeed 'conceptual shifts
that make history', but innovation is not necessarily just 'the art of doing
the same thing, better'. In conventional terminology, that is 'incremental'
innovation, while Arthur D. Little's breakthroughs constitute 'radical'
innovation.
At a time when the stakes involved in different types of innovation are at
last beginning to be understood by governments and institutional investors,
the book takes an unhelpfully narrow view of it.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Recovery signalled by new companies: Incorporations at
highest level for four years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of companies created last year was the highest in four years,
indicating economic recovery, official figures showed yesterday.
Incorporations rose to 115,000 in the 12 months to April from 109,000 in the
previous year. It was last at this level in 1990-91.
The number of companies removed from the register in the past 12 months fell
to 129,000 from 153,000 in the previous year. The total number of companies
registered in England, Wales and Scotland was 959,000.
All limited-liability companies are required to make annual filings with
Companies House, so the details provide an indication of the health of the
business sector.
The statistics appear in the latest annual report from Companies House, the
depository of corporate information, which is an executive agency of the
Department of Trade and Industry.
The annual report shows that the agency failed to meet its target of making
all documents filed by companies available to the public within five working
days of their receipt.
The average processing time was 5.9 days, with 56.7 per cent of documents
processed within the five-day target.
The agency stressed, however, that it had met all its other targets for the
year. These included ensuring that 86 per cent of companies filed their
accounts and returns in the timescale permitted. The actual performance was
88.1 per cent.
The increased compliance came in spite of a sharp increase in the total of
fines levied on companies for late filing - Pounds 15.5m in the year to
March 31, compared with Pounds 8m to March 31 1993 from July 1 1992, when
the fining regime was first introduced.
The proportion of searches for all customers completed within two hours was
99.7 per cent. It also met its target of reducing real unit costs by an
average of 2 per cent a year.
The agency has set itself a new target for this year of responding to all
telephone calls within 20 seconds and ensuring a minimum of 90 per cent of
microfiches provided to customers are free of errors.
Companies House reported almost static income of Pounds 32m in the year to
the end of March after a Pounds 17m contribution to the DTI, which was
earmarked for running company regulation and developing company law.

FT  29 JUL 94 / AZT wins recommendation in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AZT, Wellcome's controversial HIV and Aids treatment, was yesterday
recommended for use against the transmission from mother to child of HIV by
an anti-viral drugs advisory committee of the US Food and Drug
Administration.
The committee voted unanimously to recommend the drug for use by
HIV-positive pregnant women and infants based on a study of 477 women, of
which 364 finished the trial. The trial concluded that the risk of
transmission was 8.3 per cent compared with 25.5 per cent for those not
taking the treatment.
The recommendation is not binding, but the advice of committees is usually
followed by the FDA. Analysts do not expect a substantial increase in AZT
sales if it is given a licence for this particular use.
In the US, about 100,000 women of child-bearing age are HIV-positive and
about 7,000 HIV-positive women give birth each year. Between 1,500 and 2,000
infants are infected with HIV by their mothers. The treatment was started as
early as 14 weeks into pregnancy, administered to the mothers intravenously
during delivery, and given to the child for six weeks after birth.
The recommendation will help to re-establish AZT's reputation, also known as
Retrovir. Sales collapsed last year after a study questioned its
effectiveness in the treatment of HIV-positive people who did not have Aids
symptoms.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Pensions guide delayed by SIB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Full guidance on how to review the personal pensions sold to people
transferring from, or opting out of, occupational schemes will not be
available until October, the Securities and Investments Board, the chief
City regulator, said yesterday.
SIB had intended to publish by the end of this month the guidelines for life
companies and financial advisers on how to review their cases and compensate
customers who had suffered from poor advice to take a transfer or opt out.
SIB's plan was announced last December after public concern about possible
mis-selling of personal pensions was fuelled by a pilot study showing a
widespread disregard of regulatory requirements.
Announcing the delay, SIB said that the work was well-advanced but that it
wanted to assess over the summer how workable the approach which had been
developed would be. It decided against publishing any interim guidance in
case this caused confusion.
While the regulator has made progress with devising compensation
arrangements, several sensitive issues that concern the relative
responsibilities of life companies and of independent financial advisers
have not yet been resolved.
Nor has it yet been decided whether to publish the results of the two
research projects that were commissioned by SIB on the extent and range of
pensions business.
SIB insisted yesterday that the delay did not undermine the urgency with
which remedying past mistakes was being tackled.
It published guidelines in May on how life companies and advisers should go
about identifying cases which should be reviewed as a priority, for example
where the pension-holder had already retired.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Tax-based healthcare 'less burden on economy'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's tax-based system of financing healthcare places less burden on the
economy and industry than alternative funding arrangements, a study of
health and the economy concludes today.
The report says that in contrast with the insurance-based schemes in
countries such as the US, Germany, France and the Netherlands, funding from
general taxation did not represent a tax on employment. This was a
particularly important consideration given the government's concern to
improve industrial competitiveness.
The study, by the Institute for Health Policy Studies at Southampton
University, was commissioned by the National Association of Health
Authorities and Trusts. It was designed to test a claim by Mrs Virginia
Bottomley, the health secretary, that the tax-based method of funding the
National Health Service imposed a lower burden on industry than other
systems.
The NHS consumes about 6 per cent of gross domestic product - a low
proportion compared with other countries.
Britain's health spending is joint 19th among the 24 OECD nations, with only
Spain, Portugal, Greece and Turkey devoting a lower proportion of GDP to
healthcare. The report says that indicators such as life expectancy and
infant mortality show that Britain's performance was 'not markedly worse'
than most higher spending countries.
In this sense, the report says, international data supports the view that
the NHS - 83 per cent of which is financed through general taxation and a
further 13 per cent from national insurance contributions - provides good
value for money. Britain's centrally financed, cash-limited NHS has been
more successful than any other system in containing growth in spending on
health, and is relatively cheap to administer.
The main disadvantage of a tax-based system is the limited choice it offers.
Users of the NHS often face hidden costs resulting from long waiting times
and treatment in poor-quality buildings that are not reflected in
expenditure figures.
The report says health affects the economy in many wider ways than the cost
of providing healthcare. Some of the report's main concerns about healthcare
in Britain relate to such wider links.
It says the total cost of work-related illnesses and accidents is estimated
to be between Pounds 11bn and Pounds 16bn a year - the equivalent of between
2 per cent and 3 per cent of GDP.
It is widely accepted that unemployment has an adverse effect on health,
while 'those on lower incomes are much more likely to report poorer health
than those on high incomes'.

FT  29 JUL 94 / June unit trust sales rise 50% to Pounds 1.1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unit trusts had their best June on record, with net sales of Pounds 1.1bn -
50 per cent up on Pounds 726m in May. The June figure was almost 80 per cent
higher than that for June last year, when net sales totalled Pounds 610m.
Less than half the net sales last month were to the retail sector - the
lowest proportion so far this year - with the rest bought by institutions,
the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds said.
The best-selling sectors among retail investors were UK growth, followed by
UK equity income and international growth. Institutional sales were
dominated by UK general, followed by UK equity income and UK smaller
companies. Both types of investors were net sellers of European funds.
Quarterly sales figures of unit-trust personal equity plans, which shield
investments from income and capital-gains tax, were released yesterday for
the first time by the association.
Net Pep sales were Pounds 1.11bn for the second quarter - a decline, but not
as much as might be expected - from Pounds 1.55bn for the first quarter,
which is the traditionally busy end-of-tax-year sales period.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Home loans up 11%, say banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New mortgage lending by banks rose last month, figures from the British
Bankers Association showed yesterday. However, the figures suggest that the
market is relatively flat compared with last summer.
Although the figures do not amount to overwhelming evidence of a strong
recovery in the housing market, the association was confident that they were
a sign that recent tax rises had not put people off buying homes.
The statistics show that new net lending totalled Pounds 888m in June
compared with Pounds 535m in May. But after seasonal adjustments, the
increase in lending is a more modest 11 per cent - from Pounds 596m to
Pounds 664m. Both the adjusted and unadjusted figures are lower than in June
last year.
Gross loans made last month were slightly higher - at Pounds 1.75bn - than
those made last June (Pounds 1.72bn) and than gross lending in May (Pounds
1.58bn).
There was also an increase in the number and amount of new mortgages
approved in June compared with May - an important forward indicator of loans
likely to be made in the coming weeks - but the June figures were broadly in
line with those for last year.
Last month 33,568 mortgage loans - with a value of Pounds 1.76bn - were
approved compared with 30,300 worth Pounds 1.58bn in May. The equivalent
figures for June last year were 36,409 loans approved, amounting to Pounds
1.73bn.
Mr John Ecklin, director of statistics, emphasised that the percentage
increases in new mortgage lending were slightly higher than those reported
by building societies last week.
He said that although there was a seasonal element to the upturn, 'it now
seems reasonably clear that customers and prospective customers have not
been deterred by the recent tax rises, as was possibly feared with the weak
April figures'.

FT  29 JUL 94 / 'Electrobus' hits the road in fight to cut pollution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A commercial bus operator yesterday started trials of electric 'hybrid'
buses which emit much less exhaust pollution than conventional buses - but
which cost two-and-a-half times as much to buy.
Exeter-based Transit Holdings has paid Pounds 100,000 for each of the two
Electrobus 18-seat vehicles which are taking to the streets of Torquay,
Devon, making Iveco Ford the first manufacturer to supply such buses for
regular operation in the UK.
Mr Harry Blundred, Transit's chairman, said the company, which operates 750
buses in the West Country and Oxfordshire, would assess the reliability and
operating costs of the buses before deciding whether to expand the hybrid
fleet. A decision would almost certainly be made within a year.
The buses are powered primarily by a one-litre Fiat Uno car petrol engine
which is pre-set to run quietly at a fuel-efficient speed.
This engine, which is fitted with a catalytic converter, drives an
electrical generator which in turn provides current to an electric motor
driving the wheels. The generator also charges storage batteries so that the
electric motor can be fed extra power, such as when it is climbing a hill.
The bus is capable of operating on its batteries, with the petrol engine
switched off, for 20 minutes in every hour. Because it recharges its
batteries on the move, it is not subject to the severe range restrictions of
wholly battery-powered vehicles.
Howver, its complexity means that the hybrid costs Pounds 100,000, compared
with less than Pounds 40,000 for the conventional diesel-powered Iveco Daily
buses on which the hybrids are based.
But Mr Blundred said he believed that the price could come down to Pounds
70,000 if the buses were produced in volume, and that over a lifespan of at
least 10 years their operating costs might prove to be only 10 per cent to
20 per cent more than the diesel versions. About 30 of the buses have gone
into service in Italy.
Because of the higher costs Transit envisaged the vehicles being used only
on town and city-centre routes, where the need to reduce exhaust pollution
was greatest.
Mr Blundred said that if operating costs were higher than hoped, support
might be be needed from the European Commission to establish viable fleets
of the buses.

Ford yesterday opened what it said was the world's first used-car factory,
employing more than 200 on a 15-acre facility at Tilbury, Essex.
The 'Ford Direct' plant, a joint venture between Ford, Silcock Express, the
logistics group, and the Royal Automobile Club, has the capacity to
recondition and prepare as many as 1,500 used cars a week for resale by
Ford's network of franchised dealers.
The venture is believed to be the first used-car retailing scheme in which
the manufacturer takes direct responsibility for preparing vehicles for sale
and providing warranties for them.
The decision to go ahead with the project was taken in response to research
by Ford over nearly two years which showed motorists to be 'deeply cynical'
about the integrity of the retail motor trade.
More than 13,000 Ford cars up to a year old and with a total showroom value
of Pounds 105m have been refurbished and sold since the Ford Direct scheme,
selling used cars with essentially new-car warranties and with a 30-day
exchange option, started earlier this year.
The cars have until now been prepared at four small regional centres.
Ford is starting a pilot project in Scotland under which cars up to three
years old will be brought within the scheme. In the Scottish scheme, the
cars will be refurbished by dealers and passed to RAC engineers for
independent assessment.
About Pounds 5m has been spent on the Tilbury plant, which is being operated
by Silcock Express on Ford's behalf, using Ford-trained personnel. Cars less
than a year old are collected from Ford and its main fleet customers and
taken to one of five Silcock regional distribution centres for shipment to
Tilbury.
At the plant cars are labelled with a bar code allowing them to be tracked
through all stages of preparation. They then transfer to an inspection bay,
where 20 RAC engineers assess the vehicles and list refurbishment
requirements.
Silcock Express, a subsidiary of the Tibbett and Britten logistics group, is
the UK's biggest new-car distribution contractor, handling about 1.5m cars
last year. Most of Ford's rivals run their own dealer-based
'manufacturer-approved' used-car retailing schemes, such as Vauxhall's
Network Q operation, and dismissed Ford's initiative as a 'hyped-up'
variation of their own schemes.
Ford insisted, however, that its scheme eliminates the three most serious
concerns voiced by consumers about other operations: that dealer-based
'independent' pre-sale checks and tests are neither properly independent nor
rigorous; that warranties offered are not comprehensive enough; and that too
often dealers try not to honour them.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Few companies likely to take deregulatory initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only a few tens of thousands of companies are likely to take advantage of
the government's deregulatory initiative allowing them to gain exemption
from an annual audit, the head of Companies House said yesterday, Andrew
Jack writes.
Mr David Durham, chief executive and registrar of companies for England and
Wales, estimated that there were about 300,000 companies with annual
turnover of less than Pounds 90,000, which would make them eligible.
He said that a further 200,000 companies had turnover of Pounds 90,000 to
Pounds 350,000, which would allow them to have a 'compilation report' - less
rigorous than a full audit.
He expected most companies not to take advantage of the exemption because
they would still want audited accounts to gain references from credit
agencies.
The Institute of Credit Management has persistently criticised the
government's deregulatory initiative on audit exemption.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, announced exemption from mandatory audits
in his November Budget speech.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Hartlepool launches historic quay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An '18th-century' seaport, built in just 10 months on formerly derelict land
in Hartlepool, Cleveland, has opened to the public this week.
Hartlepool Historic Quay, built around the dry dock of Gray's Shipyard, is
part of the town's drive to turn itself into a tourist attraction to help
replace the jobs lost in traditional heavy industry.
The quay, a Pounds 17m Teesside Development Corporation scheme, is part of
its Hartlepool marina project. It estimates total public-sector and
private-sector investment in the marina development will reach Pounds 170m.
Some of the new buildings - reconstructions based on historic architectural
styles along the north-east coast - are recreations of premises which were
occupied two centuries ago by chandlers, gunsmiths, naval architects and
instrument-makers and other traders and craftspeople.
HMS Trincomalee, the world's second oldest floating warship, being restored
nearby, will next year be moved into the dry dock. The development
corporation hopes that 1m visitors will eventually come to the town each
year.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Fujitsu plant set for extra Pounds 300m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The County Durham microchip plant owned by Fujitsu, the Japanese electronics
group, is on target for a further Pounds 300m-plus of investment, creating
hundreds of jobs, Mr Llew Aviss, personnel director, said yesterday.
He announced that the plant at Newton Aycliffe, Fujitsu's only European
semiconductor manufacturing operation, moved into profit last October,
earlier than expected. The plant has also won an award from its Japanese
parent as the best factory of the Fujitsu group's 400 operating units
worldwide.
Mr Aviss said that the company had agreed 'in theory' to doubling later this
decade its facilities at the Newton Aycliffe plant. The site's present
facilities will reach capacity in 1996. He added: 'We need sustained output
and profitability from here on to justify the next level of investment.'
The plant's performance in clearing the debt accumulated in its start-up
phase will be a crucial factor. Mr Aviss expects a final decision on further
investment in early 1998. If approved, work would begin almost immediately.
He predicted that total employment at the site would reach 1,200 by the
2001. Investment by then will have exceeded Pounds 650m.
This compares with an original forecast that the project would create 1,500
jobs in a Pounds 400m investment.
The factory at Newton Aycliffe, run by Fujitsu subsidiary Fujitsu
Microelectronics, opened in July 1991 and began commercial production in
December 1991.
It now employs 500 people, and is set to reach a maximum of 600 in its
present facilities. Investment, now nearing Pounds 315m, is expected to be
Pounds 350m in this first phase. The plant now produces almost 2m microchips
a month.
Operating profit in the second half of 1993-94 was Pounds 10m on a full-year
turnover of Pounds 100m. In the first half of 1994-95, operating profit is
expected to be Pounds 20m. Turnover in 1994-95 will be about Pounds 110m.

FT  29 JUL 94 / NHS managers face large job losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thousands of jobs including senior Civil Service posts will disappear under
proposals to streamline the central management of the National Health
Service announced yesterday.
Strict upper limits on the number of staff employed in regional
administration will lead to the abolition of more than half the posts in
regional health authorities.
The regions have already been through one recent job-reduction exercise,
which resulted in the number of people working in them being cut to 2,600
from 3,900 last year. Under yesterday's proposals a further 1,500 posts will
go.
In addition, 2,300 employees in the Department of Health's headquarters in
London and the 1,000 in the Leeds-based NHS executive were warned yesterday
that there would be 'substantial' cuts.
The reductions are likely to begin in the autumn. The government said it
hoped to avoid compulsory redundancies.
The proposed losses are the result of a review of the NHS's central
management requirements now that much decision-making has been devolved to
local level. Ministers have been under pressure to stem the growth in
mana-gerial and administrative posts.
Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, said yesterday that he was taking similar
steps to improve NHS efficiency in Wales. He plans to divert Pounds 12.5m
from administrative costs to patient care over three years.
The reductions in staff in the English regions will save about Pounds 90m.
Ministers plan to replace the English regional health authorities with eight
new area offices of the NHS executive, and a maximum staffing level of 135
has been set for each of these.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Construction sector chiefs expect pre-election boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government attempts to stimulate the economy in the approach to the next
general election are likely to lead to a much bigger rise in construction
output in 1996 than previously forecast, industry leaders said yesterday.
The latest an election could be held is spring 1997. Construction companies
believe ministers are determined that by then work will have started on the
Pounds 2bn Channel tunnel rail link.
Work is also likely to have started on the first generation of roads under
which contractors would receive a fee from the government to finance, build
and maintain a road for an agreed number of years. The fee would depend on
road use.
The National Council of Building Material Producers said yesterday that this
could lead to a modest increase in road construction in a potential election
year.
As a result the council, which represents companies with a combined annual
turnover of more than Pounds 30bn, has increased its forecast for
construction growth in 1996. It expects output to rise 4 per cent in the
year, compared with only 2.5 per cent when it last published forecasts four
months ago.
The biggest change is a much improved forecast for infrastructure work,
which is expected to rise 3 per cent in 1996. Previously the council
forecast a 3 per cent fall.
Cuts in public spending mean infrastructure output is expected to fall
sharply in the next two years - by 7 per cent this year and 5 per cent next
year - before increasing in 1996.
The council has not changed its forecast that total construction output will
rise 2 per cent this year and 2.5 per cent next year, although it expects
the recovery in private housing to be slightly slower than previously
forecast.
It had forecast that builders would start work on 160,000 private-sector
homes this year. It has reduced this forecast to 155,000 to take account of
a slower rate of recovery in the housing market since Easter.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Hurd warns against shift to right
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd insisted last night that the government would not cede the
political centre ground to Mr Tony Blair's Labour party as he set out a
'commonsense' strategy to rebuild Tory self-confidence.
In a speech which carried an implicit warning against a lurch to the right,
the foreign secretary said the Conservatives alone were able to strike an
intelligent balance between the demands of a vibrant free market and the
claims of the community.
His comments came as cabinet ministers agreed at their last meeting before
the summer break to launch a concerted autumn campaign to highlight the
clear divisions between the Tory and Labour approaches.
Speaking in Newbury, Berkshire - the scene of the disastrous by-election
defeat last year which plunged his party into turmoil - Mr Hurd sought to
dispel any notion that the new Labour leader could win the battle of ideas.
Instead Mr Blair's attempts to embrace the market had shown him to be
'wandering aimlessly' across past political battlefields.
Mr Hurd said the Conservatives still occupied the high ground in the battle
of ideas, demonstrating since 1979 the 'massive power for good' of the free
market. The economic recovery would allow the government to rebuild
self-confidence by 'expressing our commonsense policies in a framework of
Conservative philosophy'.
Mr Hurd stressed that his approach built on the ideas for a more limited
role for the state and greater freedom for the individual set out earlier
this week by Mr John Major.
But the foreign secretary's repeated emphasis on the market as a tool to
'strengthen and refresh our institutions, not to destroy them' was in marked
contrast to the call from many rightwing ministers for a more radical
agenda.
Citing the examples of the government's approach to the civil service, the
BBC and the Post Office, Mr Hurd said that Conservative reform was 'driven
by common sense rather than ideology'. Change should come in response to
need rather than dogma and should be designed to strengthen not weaken
institutions and communities.

FT  29 JUL 94 / DTI may widen export project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Trade and Industry may expand the 'export promoters'
initiative which recruits private-sector executives to the DTI to help
companies win business in world markets.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said yesterday that the
DTI had reached its initial target of 100 private-sector secondees and he
was looking at proposals to seek a second wave of recruits.
Mr Heseltine said the scheme, started 18 months ago and intended to raise UK
sales in 80 of the world's most important markets, was starting to 'run into
constraints'. He believed the only option was to increase the scale of the
operation. Recruits are seconded for two years and continue to be paid by
their employers.
The DTI initiative, regarded by Mr Heseltine as an important element in his
department's efforts to forge a working partnership with industry, has
involved more than 8,000 UK companies. He said the scheme had provided
tangible results in helping companies to find new markets and to finalise
contracts.
Mr Heseltine added: 'The promoters are forging closer ties between
government and the private sector, making business more aware of the help
available from government and enabling us to discover what it requires in
return.'
He said it was impossible to quantify the benefit to the balance of trade
but he believed it could help to reduce the deficit significantly. The
initiative offered 'open-ended benefits' to UK trade which the government
was determined to exploit.
The DTI said yesterday that, in addition to the export promoters scheme, it
planned to enlist a further 70 private-sector recruits to its nationwide
chain of Business Link centres.
They will provide access for local exporting businesses to the export
promotion resources of the DTI and the Foreign Office.

<TEXT>
Kimberly-Clark, the US consumer products group, is to locate its European
headquarters in the UK after investigating sites in the Netherlands, France
and Belgium, Andrew Taylor writes.
The company is to consolidate its existing European offices in Paris, the
Hague and in Tonbridge, Kent in one building. It has eight factories in the
UK, two in France, two in Germany and one in the Netherlands.
One of the attractions of the UK is thought to be labour costs, estimated to
be a third of those at continental locations.
Kimberly-Clark has appointed property consultants Grimley J R Eve to find
premises to accommodate more than 500 staff around the south and west of
London between the M23 and A3.
The company will consider building a headquarters on a greenfield site if a
suitable building cannot be found.
It said the UK was attractive because of international schools and access to
international airports at Gatwick and Heathrow.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Hundreds of Nestle staff jobs to be shed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hundreds of redundancies among administrative staff were announced yesterday
by Nestle UK, part of the world's largest foods and mineral-waters groups,
Lisa Wood writes.
The company declined to comment on the redundancies but the employees
affected said that up to 450 jobs were being cut, with the heaviest losses
at the company's headquarters at Croydon, south London. It is understood
that the losses will be over 18 months and many should be voluntary.
Nestle, which is reviewing all aspects of its business, said: 'Details of
the results of the first stage, which looked at ways of simplifying working
practices at Nestle UK's headquarters in Croydon and at parts of the York
and Hadfield sites, are currently being given to employees and we are unable
to comment further.'
The group has 17,000 employees in the UK.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Water review aims for a three-way balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Mr Ian Byatt, the water industry regulator, made clear yesterday, his
price review was not only about defusing the row over soaring household
water bills. He had to ensure that the water companies have enough money to
finance the huge clean-up required by EU directives and pay adequate
dividends to shareholders.
His new K-factors, limiting price increases to 1 percentage point a year
above inflation for 10 years, are supposed to strike a three-way balance
between these considerations. Judging by the mixed reaction yesterday they
were a partial success.
Consumers were disappointed that prices will still go up. Environmentalists
said there will not be enough money to clean up beaches and rivers. Some
water companies accepted the new price controls, but one will appeal. The
stock market heaved a sigh of relief and marked up shares, but that was only
because dealers had discounted them in anticipation of the worst.
The review's main outcome - a prediction that water prices will rise by just
under 1 per cent a year in real terms over the next 10 years - is certainly
a big improvement on recent increases, which have averaged 5 per cent and
caused storms of protest. But it falls short of Mr Byatt's statement last
year that consumers did not see why water bills should rise faster than
inflation.
The consumer viewpoint was summed up by the National Consumer Council, which
only a fortnight ago published a scathing attack on the returns reaped by
water company shareholders at consumers' expense. It said: 'The fact that
prices will go up less than otherwise is obviously good news. But they will
continue to rise faster than inflation.'
There is a limit, however, to how far Mr Byatt could go in limiting price
rises. Although he can shift more investment costs from consumers and to the
water companies themselves, his first statutory duty is to ensure that the
water industry can finance its environmental obligations.
But he did not satisfy the opposition parties, which accused him of being
soft on the companies - and on generous salaries for chairmen.
Mr Chris Smith, Labour's spokesman on environmental protection, said the
review had failed to stop water companies loading most of the costs of
long-term investment on current consumers. He said: 'Mr Byatt has said in
the past that the water companies could borrow much more - at preferential
rates - to finance essential long-term improvements. But here he has
completely ducked the issue.'
The reaction in the water industry ranged from cautious to grudging,
although this disguised a sense of relief that the new limits are not as
tough as many had feared.
The fact that only one company - South West Water, which faces especially
large investment demand - will challenge its new price limits is probably
the most palpable evidence that Mr Byatt has presented the industry with a
price regime it can live with - and certainly an easier one than he proposed
in his opening discussions.
Mr Mike Taylor, finance director of Northumbrian Water, said: 'I think he
struck a hard bargain with everybody, but got a little soft at the end.
Mr Mike Swallow, director of the Water Companies' Association, the trade
group, said some of his members 'have come to an initial view that (the
K-factors) are tough but succeed in striking a balance between the interests
of customers and shareholders'.
This was also the view in the City, where analysts believed that the new
K-factors would not seriously inhibit the industry's financial position, or
its ability to pay sizeable real increases in annual dividends.
Mr Lakis Athanasiou, a UBS analyst, said: 'There's a price for everything.
He could have been tighter and not given problems, but you probably would
have had a few more companies going to the MMC.'
Much of the pressure of tighter controls will have to be absorbed by greater
efficiency in the water industry. So the challenge now will be on management
to meet its investment obligations, and still have enough to keep
shareholders contented. Mr Byatt thinks the industry can manage this, and
analysts calculate that there is enough fat to keep interest and dividend
cover at healthy levels.
Even so, Mr Byatt expects that the rate of return on water-company assets
will more than halve from last year's 13 per cent to about 6 per cent over
the 10 years covered. Even though Mr Byatt expects investment and other
factors to add Pounds 47 to the typical household water bill by 2005, he
expects tighter returns and operating expenditure to cut that by Pounds 24,
bringing the increase down to Pounds 23.
But although Mr Byatt stressed that 'profits will be lower' he declined to
go into any detail. The level of profit companies earned and the dividends
they paid were a matter for company boards and management. Nor was he
willing to speculate whether his K-factors would help rein in chairmen's
salaries.
MAIN POINTS
Water prices to rise by annual average of 0.9 percentage points over
inflation from 1995-2005.
Average increase in household water bills to be Pounds 23 by 200, with wide
regional variations.
Household connection costs to be Pounds 200 next year.
10-year investment programme of Pounds 24bn
Companies' rates of return to halve in 10 years

FT  29 JUL 94 / Shielding consumers from costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the main aims of yesterday's review was to contain the upward
pressure on water bills caused by the huge investment in the water system.
This spending was made necessary partly by decades of neglect and partly by
the Brussels-led drive to deal with urban waste water and put an end to the
pumping of raw sewage into the sea.
Mr Byatt estimated total water company investment plans for the next 10
years at Pounds 24bn, of which Pounds 11bn is needed for quality
improvements, Pounds 12bn for maintaining the system and Pounds 1bn for
improving customer service. He hopes to cushion the impact on household
water bills in a number of ways.
First, a more rigorous review of the costs has shown that savings can be
achieved. The urban waste water treatment directive, originally costed at
Pounds 10bn, now carries a price tag of Pounds 6bn, partly because the
recession has driven down construction costs and partly because the
government has reclassified some 'sensitive waters'.
A relaxation of rules on sewage discharges into rivers - yet to be announced
 -is also thought to have contributed to a further Pounds 2bn in savings.
Against that, the government has added Pounds 522m in river clean-up costs,
although this is half what was projected.
Second, the investment is to be stretched over a longer period. Although
this will not mean any work is cancelled it will make the financing easier.
Third, more of the cost is to be borne by the water companies rather than
being passed to the consumer.
Mr Byatt made clear yesterday that he believed there was considerable scope
for savings in the industry. He said that it could bring down its operating
costs and live with lower rates of return on capital.
He estimated that operating expenditure on existing services could be
reduced by 2 per cent a year up to 2000, and by 1 per cent each year after
that.
The bulk of this investment - Pounds 14bn - will happen in the first five
years, and the aim is to stop nearly all sewage being pumped into the sea by
1998. After 2000 capital spending will fall sharply from an annual peak of
about Pounds 3bn.
The cost of these investments falls heaviest on water companies with large
stretches of coastline, which is why customers in coastal areas will see
water bills rising faster than those living inland. But inland companies,
particular Thames Water, will be investing about Pounds 500m to prevent
houses being flooded by sewage.
One effect of the tougher financial discipline will be to force companies to
finance more investment through borrowings. This will spread the cost to the
future, and to later generations which will benefit from the improvements.

FT  29 JUL 94 / South West stung and ready to fight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ian Byatt's findings for South West Water stood out among the 10 water
and sewerage companies like a 'sore thumb', Mr Ken Hill, the company's
finance director, said yesterday.
His sentiments were echoed in the industry and the City. 'They haven't got a
hope in hell of doing their coastline schemes,' said one water company
managing director.
South West has a long coastline that has to be cleaned up under European
legislation and has a relatively small population to help fund it. Its
unique situation prompted the regulator three years ago to increase its
K-factor, the allowed price increase above inflation, from 6 percentage
points to 11.5 points. This time he was tougher.
Mr Byatt said: 'They have already had their big price increase, and their
bills are very high. I believe they could do it within the price limits I
have given them.'
South West intends to take the issue to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
Mr Hill said that the effect of yesterday's announcement was to demand
efficiency savings of Pounds 400m over five years to pay for obligations
which had not changed since the regulator agreed the increased K-factor.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Companies and City satisfied with outcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was difficult for at least nine of the 10 water and sewerage companies to
hide their satisfaction yesterday at what were widely seen to be
better-than-expected average price increases in the regulator's 10-year
review.
Welsh Water had said it would accept nothing less than a K-factor of 2 to
fund capital expenditure obligations of Pounds 1bn - the K-factor is the
number of percentage points above inflation by which companies can raise
prices. But it said the outcome - a K-factor of 0.5 - was 'absolutely
wonderful'. This was in spite of a capital spending allowance only slightly
trimmed to Pounds 950m. Mr Paul Twamley, finance director, said: 'Everyone
knows this is a negotiation.'
It appears that Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat director-general, - who repeatedly
insisted the price review process was anything but a negotiation - had been
flexible towards the end of the review. In most cases, the draft K-factor
issued to companies for comments at the end of May had been revised upwards
for the final announcement.
One water industry executive said it had been 'touch and go up to the
eleventh hour' whether his company would go to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
Although the K-factors were substantially less than those companies sought a
year ago in their market plans, capital spending obligations had been reined
in more sharply than many had expected. This was because companies had been
allowed to defer spending and because estimates for costs such as population
growth had been squeezed.
Anglian Water, where prices will rise annually by 1.5 percentage points
above inflation, said Mr Byatt had 'fixed a fair balance between
shareholders and customers'. The second five years remained unacceptable,
however. 'That has got to be put right at the turn of the century,' said Mr
Alan Smith, managing director.
Although Southern and Yorkshire refused to make their views known before
considering the details, it seems South West will be the only company to
appeal Mr Byatt's decisions.
Southern, which is particularly vulnerable to the effects of the urban waste
water review, is widely seen to be one of the biggest winners from the price
review.
The biggest loser was obviously South West, where Mr Byatt's decision to
reduce the K-factor from 11.5 to 1.5 was greeted with some puzzlement in the
industry and by the City of London. 'It looks as though they have been
stitched up,' said one industry executive.
In the end, the companies and the City were more optimistic than for some
time on earnings and dividend prospects. Water shares rose strongly as a
result, largely because of what Mr Graeme Moyse of brokers Kleinwort Benson
decribed as 'gut relief' on dividend prospects.
Analysts, who had been expecting dividend growth for the sector over the
next five years of about 3 percentage points above inflation, said 4
percentage points now seemed achievable.
Shares in regional electricity companies also moved ahead as the City
considered the implications for the power sector of the water review.
The electricity regulator is due to announce later this month a review of
the regional companies' distribution businesses, which contribute the bulk
of their profits.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Judge attacks arms trial 'abuse'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Customs and Excise and the Foreign Office 'interfered with the course of
justice' by stopping potential defence witnesses giving evidence in an
arms-for-Iraq case, the Court of Appeal said yesterday.
Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice, said: 'The machinations in this case to
prevent witnesses for the defence being available, coupled with the
non-disclosure of what had been done, constituted such an interference with
the justice process as to amount to an abuse of it.'
He was giving the court's reasons for its decision earlier this month to
clear Atlantic Commercial, a defence consultancy, of being concerned in
exporting, and attempting to export, arms with intent to evade export
prohibitions.
Atlantic Commercial, based in Cuckney, Mansfield, Notts, was fined Pounds
7,500 at the Old Bailey in November 1985. Mr Alexander Schlesinger, a
director, and Mr Reginald Dunk, a consultant were fined Pounds 3,000 and
Pounds 12,500 respectively.
The appeal court ordered Customs to pay their costs.
The case concerned consignments of Sterling Mark 5 sub-machine guns
intercepted by Customs and Excise. The defendants had planned to contest the
case and call witnesses from the Iraqi and Jordanian embassies in London to
confirm the legality of the contracts. But they opted to plead guilty when
the witnesses failed to attend court.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bilsthorpe colliery tragedy of August last year occurred because British
Coal misunderstood or underestimated the effects of previous workings on the
rock strata, a public inquiry has found.
Three miners died at the Nottinghamshire mine after a fall of sandstone
underground.
The accident prompted a probe by the Health and Safety Executive, which then
set up a public inquiry.
The inquiry concentrated on the use of rock-bolting to hold up the roof. It
called the general use of rock-bolting 'well-established and proven' but
questioned the sole use of rock bolts at Bilsthorpe because the roadway
where the accident took place ran alongside an old tunnel. There had been
limited experience with bolting under those conditions.
It called for the unions to co-operate with mining companies and the Health
and Safety Executive in a National Committee on the Safety of Mines.

FT  29 JUL 94 / TGWU chief attacks 'intimidating' faction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU, Britain's largest industrial
union, has warned his union officers that the organisation faces serious
internal conflict from a group of members who he alleges are resorting to
intimidation in trying to achieve their ends with the threat of occupying
union property.
In a circular sent this month to all TGWU branch secretaries, officers and
staff, Mr Morris says the union is involved in a 'struggle for democracy and
decency'.
His unprecedented outburst follows the occupation of the union's national
computer centre in Newcastle on July 6 by Mr John Farrell, a former TGWU
trade group secretary on Merseyside, and at least 30 of his supporters.
The group was protesting over the dismissal in June of Mr Farrell on various
conduct-related grounds, which the TGWU said included abuse of dispute
benefit payments.
Mr Farrell took court action, which ultimately failed, to prevent his
dismissal - but he plans to appeal against his dismissal at the union's
biennial conference in June next year.
Last night Mr Farrell denied the charges of intimidation in the occupation
of the computer centre. 'If he (Mr Morris) believes this, why has he not
called in the police?' asked Mr Farrell.
In his circular Mr Morris says: 'A member of the union's staff was subjected
to intimidation in the course of an action which had the effect of halting
the provision of services to the union's membership. The attack disrupted
the administration of the union, resulting in delay to union benefits being
paid and payments to TGWU pensioners.'
Mr Farrell said last night that the official concerned, who had held the key
to the office, had not reported the matter to the police.
The TGWU leader has told the union's officers that the assault on the union
was 'every bit as serious as any external challenge which we have faced over
the past 15 years'.
The union's finance and general purposes committee has condemned Mr
Farrell's temporary seizure of the building.
Mr Morris has told officials that when Mr Farrell and his supporters left
the computer centre they were reported to have 'threatened that more
so-called direct occupations would follow'.
Their occupation followed a number of internal union disciplinary hearings
over Mr Farrell's case that started in February and ended on June 17 when
the union's general executive council decided to dismiss him.
In the early stages of the affair Mr Farrell sought a High Court injunction
against the TGWU, claiming the procedures for the disciplinary hearing
against him were unfair and against natural justice. The judge dismissed Mr
Farrell's case after four days. The union is now seeking to reclaim
substantial legal costs from him over the court proceedings.
Mr Morris says in his letter to TGWU officials: 'I know you will share my
determination that we cannot allow intimidation to deter us from following
our democratic rules and procedures which have served the union well for
seventy-two years.'

FT  29 JUL 94 / Receivers to Swans gloomy on rescue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The receivers to Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder facing closure, last
night voiced grave doubts about a proposal from the sole prospective bidder
for the company.
Joint receiver Mr Ed James of Price Waterhouse said outline proposals from
French-owned Soffia/CMN would need be 'significantly improved', both in
terms of the price offered and Swans' substantial continuing operating costs
pending a sale, for there to be any chance of agreement.
He said he had invited Mr Iskandar Safa, head of Soffia, parent company of
patrol boat builder Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie, to meet him
immediately, but warned the yard's future prospects were 'extremely
uncertain'.
Mr Safa has said he will not buy Swans, which runs out of work in November,
unless it has a guaranteed two-year, Pounds 50m workload. An attempt to
fulfil this by winning the refit of the landing ship Sir Bedivere failed
last week when Rosyth won the order.
A decision by the receivers to seek more work for Swans, in the hope that
Soffia would then buy it, would be a costly gamble; tendering for an MoD
ocean survey vessel, the most imminent order prospect, would cost between
Pounds 500,000 and Pounds 1m. The receivers have said there are no other
prospective buyers.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Probe on coal mine deaths reports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bilsthorpe colliery tragedy of August 1993 occurred because British Coal
misunderstood or underestimated the effects of previous workings on the rock
strata at the mine, a public inquiry has found.
Three miners died at the Nottinghamshire coal mine when they were engulfed
by a fall of sandstone half a mile underground.
The accident prompted an investigation into safety at the mine by the Health
and Safety Executive, which then set up a public inquiry conducted by Sir
Bernard Crossland of Queen's University, Belfast.
The inquiry concentrated on whether the use of rock-bolting to hold up the
roof was safe.
Under this system a bolt is driven into the rock and held fast with resin.
The bolts hold steel straps which make a caged roof for the mine roadway.
At the inquiry Mr Arthur Scargill, leader of the National Union of
Mineworkers, argued that rock-bolting made an accident like the one at
Bilsthorpe almost inevitable.
Sir Bernard called the general use of rock-bolting 'well-established and
proven'.
But in his inquiry report, he questioned the sole use of rock bolts at
Bilsthorpe because the roadway where the accident took place ran alongside
an old tunnel - so-called 'skin-to-skin working'.
There had been limited experience with rock-bolting under those conditions.
Sir Bernard drew attention to the fact that the roof was solidly supported
on one side only, and that rock fractures caused by the old Bilsthorpe
workings were underestimated.
There was 'a roof deformation mechanism which was beyond the control of the
rock bolts,' his report said.
The report also said that the use of more traditional roof support methods
would not have reduced the speed of sandstone fall.

FT  29 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Japan ready to open markets a little - But
not as much as Washington wants / The US deadline draws nearer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan is putting to the US new proposals aimed at opening its markets
further to foreign companies, but officials in Tokyo indicated yesterday
that these would fall short of the Clinton administration's demands that it
agree standards by which improvements could be measured.
The US has set Sunday night as the deadline for agreement on changes in
Japan's procurement regime governing telecommunications and medical
equipment.
If no agreement is reached, the US will then cite Japan as having a closed
market and start the clock running for 60 days of talks and consultations
during which Japan would have to make suitable concessions or face
sanctions.
That period would end on September 30, the same day the US must announce the
world's most unfair trading practices under the revised Super 301 law which
allows US action against countries discriminating against US exports.
Mr Sadayuki Hayashi, Japan's deputy foreign minister, was due to arrive in
Washington last night for talks with Ms Charlene Barshefsky, the deputy US
trade representative. These talks follow the failure of last weekend's
negotiating session on liberalising any of the three key sectors in which
the US says Japan must show progress: insurance, government procurement of
telecommunications and medical equipment, and vehicles.
Moves on the latter two fronts were being suggested in Tokyo yesterday. The
Japan Eximbank said it was considering overtures from the big three Detroit
car makers for concessional loans which they would use to boost production
of right-hand drive vehicles for the Japanese market.
Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry said a 'viable
compromise' could be reached on procurement policies for government
departments and other big state purchasing authorities which would benefit
foreign telecoms and medical equipment suppliers.
Under an existing agreement to come into force next April, each contract
worth more than SDR800,000 (Dollars 1.1m) will be put out to international
tender. Miti officials suggested that lowering this threshold progressively
was the 'only reasonable solution' to US complaints that its companies would
still be shut out of lucrative deals.
They said potential foreign bidders would be canvassed for their views on
technical specifications and price. But they made clear that the current
plan would increase tenfold the workload in ministerial procurement
departments where Japan's economic downturn had squeezed funding. Mr Hayashi
is said to be unlikely to countenance a reduction to anywhere below
SDR400,000, and will probably hold out for a higher trigger point and
another two years or more before that would take effect.
But Miti acknowledges that these are points of detail in meeting the wider
US demand for measurable criteria which would commit the Japanese government
to delivering progress in the private sector as well as on its own behalf.
The Liberal Democratic party, which under Mr Kiichi Miyazawa reached the
framework agreement with President Bill Clinton last July, may be back in
office after a year's absence during which Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, his
reformist successor, refused to submit to US strictures during trade talks
in February. No Japanese party appears prepared, however, to stomach an
accord echoing the 1991 semiconductor pact which committed Japan to allowing
foreign producers a 20 per cent share of its domestic market.
Even if they are not expressed in cold numerical terms, Japan sees such
targets as handing Washington a stick with which it could be given a beating
at any politically convenient moment. But as one US official in Tokyo put it
yesterday, 'How then do we declare success? Even if it's backward-looking,
how are we to know what's good or bad unless we can decide in advance' what
the goals should be?

FT  29 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Asians upset over textiles - Change in US
rules of import origin 'will disrupt trade'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Business Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Asian textiles and clothing exporters and US retailers and garment importers
are protesting at a proposed change in US rules of origin for textiles
imports which, they say, could seriously disrupt international trade and
investment.
The proposal, which has received backing in Congress, would rewrite US
customs rules by defining products' origin according to the country where
they were 'assembled', instead of where they were cut.
Hong Kong, one of the exporters which is most at risk, said yesterday that
the change conflicted with US commitments under the Uruguay Round trade
deal. It also challenged the recent agreement to phase out the Multi-Fibre
Arrangements, which restrict world textiles trade.
The Hong Kong government has joined the governments of Australia and of
members of the Association of South East Asian Nations in writing to senior
Clinton administration officials and congressional leaders to express their
concern.
They are lobbying in close co-op-eration with the US Association of
Importers of Textiles and Apparel, whose members include jeans manufacturer
Levi-Strauss, fashion house Liz Claiborne and The Limited, a leading retail
chain.
Ms Laura Jones, the association's executive director, condemned the proposal
yesterday as a protectionist measure which would raise the cost of US
textiles imports by several hundred million dollars a year.
The proposal, strongly supported by US textiles and clothing makers, has
been approved in principle by the House of Representatives' powerful ways
and means committee as part of its draft Uruguay Round implementing
legislation. The Senate finance committee is considering a similar
amendment.
Officially, the US administration has adopted a neutral stance towards these
moves. However, critics say some senior officials have appeared to indicate
support for the change.
Though the detailed effects of the proposal are hard to predict, it could
upset existing arrangements under which textiles produced in one country are
shipped to another to be made into clothing and then exported as a product
of the first country.
Opponents fear that would require exporters abruptly to switch output
between national quotas imposed under the MFA and could lead to higher
tariffs on some US imports.
Ms Jones of the US importers' association said the proposal would
particularly affect Hong Kong, which sends large amounts of textiles to be
processed in China, whose US textiles quota is already filled to capacity.
Hong Kong said that as well as threatening existing commercial arrangements,
the proposal called into question the basis of the agreement in the Uruguay
Round to phase out the MFA. It also challenged pledges by Gatt members to
refrain from new trade restrictions before the round took effect.
Comitextil, a leading organisation of European clothing and textiles
manufacturers, said the proposal could affect some of its members' exports
to the US.
However, the organisation was not protesting because the proposal would move
US rules of origin closer to those used by the EU.
Unlike the EU, the US at present uses different rules of origin for
different types of products.
The US Treasury is currently considering plans to standardise its rules,
though it is unclear how this move would fit in with the proposals in
Congress.
Gatt members also agreed as part of the Uruguay Round to discuss ways of
harmonising their definitions of rules of origin on a worldwide basis.

FT  29 JUL 94 / World Trade News: EU cautious on S Africa aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union is on the brink of approving a package of trade benefits
to South Africa which falls short of promises to offer generous support to
the new post-apartheid regime headed by President Nelson Mandela.
The niggardly offer stems from French-led efforts to protect the European
market against potentially competitive South African products, particularly
in the paper and agricultural sectors, according to British and German
officials. A second factor appears to be concern that South African
penetration of European markets may be at the cost of francophone Africa, as
well as former Portuguese colonies in Mozambique and Angola.
The EU-South Africa negotiations are seen as a test case because the new
regime in Pretoria sees itself as the prototype of a new developing country
eager to use trade rather than aid to reduce income disparities and compete
in the world economy.
Britain and Germany have successfully pressed France to be more forthcoming
during negotiations on the trade package, which was promised before the
first free elections in South Africa last May.
French hesitation aroused resentment in Brussels because President Francois
Mitterrand insisted on being the first European leader to visit Mr Mandela
after his inauguration.
Negotiations involve the EU giving South Africa access to its generalised
system of preferences which grants tariff advantages to developing countries
to help them export to the EU market. The first European Commission proposal
on GSP was estimated to be worth Ecu260m (Dollars 317m).
The GSP debate this week has been conducted at EU ambassadorial level in
Brussels, with the central questions turning on which manufactured products
should be included on a list eligible for GSP. Processed fruit, where South
Africa has a distinct competitive advantage, is not on the list because of
Mediterranean objections.
Under a compromise, the EU is considering removing some sensitive products
from the GSP list and subjecting them to a 'tariff free quota' as well as
surveillance mechanisms. Among these are wood and furniture (Italy), metal
furniture (Portugal), manganese oxide (Belgium) and paper (France). EU
diplomats hope for a deal in the next week which could go into effect under
a fast-track written procedure, without ministerial approval. But this
requires unanimity.
The present trade package is due to last until the new year, when member
states are due to approve a revised GSP system which will encourage
developing countries to improve labour and environmental standards.
The next step will be to conclude a deal between South Africa and the EU
which may include offering the Pretoria regime something like the Lome
Convention, the privileged status accorded to former European colonies in
Africa.

FT  29 JUL 94 / World Trade News: 'Unacceptable' terms for entering Gatt
anger China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS

<TEXT>
China said yesterday it was prepared to continue negotiations on terms of
entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade but made clear that
certain demands, especially by the US, were 'unacceptable'.
Speaking to an informal session of the Gatt working party on Chinese
membership, Mr Long Yongtu, Beijing's chief Gatt negotiator, said progress
since the last meeting a month ago had been 'disappointing'. Nevertheless,
China would continue to participate in negotiations on its accession
protocol 'with a flexible and constructive attitude'.
Perhaps significantly, Mr Long did not mention China's aspiration to become
a Gatt member this year so as to join its successor, the World Trade
Organisation, as a founding member. This timetable is looking increasingly
ambitious but not yet impossible.
Mr Long's remarks represent a considerable softening of tone from the angry
blasts out of Beijing in recent days. Chinese officials have accused the US
of blocking its membership bid and have threatened to call off the
eight-year talks if Washington does not back down from demanding China join
Gatt as a developed country.
China this week circulated a paper outlining what it considered should be in
the accession protocol, a move which western trade diplomats took as a clear
sign of Beijing's continued readiness to negotiate. However, they said there
was a very wide gap between China's 'minimalist' version and the
'maximalist' terms included in a paper compiled by Mr Pierre-Louis Girard,
the Swiss chairman of the working party.
In the most detailed statement of Beijing's position so far, Mr Long said
China was prepared to take on its full obligations as a member of Gatt and
the WTO. It was not seeking special privileges but insisted on its
entitlement to full membership rights, including those accorded to
developing country members.
Presenting a 10-point list of 'non-negotiable' demands in the Girard paper,
Mr Long said Gatt members were trying to prevent China having recourse to
Gatt's balance of payments provisions and dispute settlement procedures. And
he warned that denial of developing country status in agriculture could
trigger 'social unrest' among China's 800m farmers.

FT  29 JUL 94 / National party battles to redraw S African role: Speculation
mounts that it might withdraw from the cabinet as it attempts to find a
political identity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Having served nearly three months as junior partner in South Africa's
coalition government, deputy president F W de Klerk's National party is
struggling to find an independent political role for itself in the new
regime.
Amid widespread reports that several backbenchers and some senior members
are advocating that the party withdraw from the cabinet and take up a more
traditional opposition role, the NP is trying to develop a new policy
framework ahead of next week's opening of parliament.
Speculation about the NP's future has been so intense that it has affected
the stock market. On Wednesday the party was forced to publish an official
statement denying any plans to leave the cabinet, and defending its
'important and constructive' role in the government of national unity
mandated by the new South African constitution. Under that constitution all
parties which won more than 5 per cent of the vote in April's elections are
entitled to proportionate cabinet representation.
The National party has six cabinet members, but with the recent resignation
of Mr Derek Keys as finance minister and his impending replacement by Mr
Chris Liebenberg, who is not a member of any political party, its
representation will be reduced to five.
Mr Keys' resignation also leaves the NP without any cabinet members in
senior positions as it had earlier lost a struggle to retain one of the
security portfolios. With the party's scope for independent manoeuvre
limited by the need for cabinet consensus, local analysts have begun to
question whether it will be able to survive as an independent political
force.
The problem has been exacerbated by the low profile Mr de Klerk has kept
since the elections. Before the poll he and President Nelson Mandela were
seen as something of a double act. Mr de Klerk now lacks an effective
executive position in government and has been largely relegated to the
political background.
This has been, in part, a deliberate decision by the NP to give the new
government time to find its feet but, privately, NP ministers have
complained about insufficient ANC consultation in government policy-making
and younger party members are eager to break free of the artificial
political coalition and begin to criticise ANC policies more openly.
With a huge amount of controversial legislation due to be debated in the new
parliamentary session, the party has realised it must stake out an
independent political position for itself. To this end the NP is due to draw
up a new policy framework at a party conference today and Mr de Klerk is set
to make a statement on Monday in which he is expected to outline a plan of
action.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Allies accused by US of appeasing Iran
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US yesterday accused its allies of 'appeasing' Iran, in the wake of
recent terrorist bombings attributed to pro-Iranian Islamic groups.
Although not named, Germany and Japan, both of which have maintained
commercial relations with Tehran, were clearly among the targets of
criticism from Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, who called
Iran an 'outlaw nation'. The US has also complained in the recent past about
German intelligence contacts with Iran.
Yesterday, Mr Christopher told the House of Representatives foreign affairs
committee that the bombings in Latin America and London were 'a tragic
reminder that the enemies of peace remain formidable'.
He named Hizbollah, a Lebanese Shia group, as one of a number that 'wreak
havoc and bloodshed' and must be defeated, adding that 'Hizbollah's patron,
Iran, must be contained'.
Iran, he said, 'is an international outlaw, yet some nations still conduct
preferential commercial relations with Iran and some take steps to appease
that outlaw nation. They must understand that by doing so, they make it
easier for Iran to use its resources to sponsor terrorism thorughout the
world'.
He described himself as 'absolutely mystified why these countries are
unwilling to put their commercial interests aside and recognise that this
kind of terrorism must be dealt with and dealt with very harshly'.
In London, Mr John Major, the British premier, accused the Iranian
government of presenting 'a serious challenge to the international
community,' amid a growing conviction in Whitehall that an Iranian-sponsored
terrorist group was responsible for the London bombings.
Mr Major said that Britain would prefer a normal relationship with Iran, but
that many aspects of its behaviour were 'simply unacceptable.'
The prime minister also went out of his way to condemn the Iranian
government for behaviour that was 'threatening' to the international
community.
He said the British authorities could not yet be certain which country or
group lay behind the terrorist acts but they had been perpetrated by people
'who refuse to abide by the rule of law and by the principles of a civilised
society.'
His warning came amid indications British officials have gathered
intelligence which suggests the group which carried out the London bombimgs
was also responsible for the suicide car bomb attack on a Jewish centre in
Buenos Aires, in which 96 people were killed earlier this month.
British officials said there was not yet unequivocal proof of the
involvement of Tehran, but that all the circumstantial evidence pointed in
that direction. If that judgment was confirmed it could lead to a renewed
break in Britain's relations with Iran.
Mr Christopher declined to name the countries appeasing Iran. The US, would
share intelligence about Iran with them 'to see if we can't draw them back
from this conduct which I think unnecessarily encourages Iran and is very
destructive of the international co-ordination that we should have.'
The UN Security Council is today expected to issue a statement strongly
condemning terrorism and emphasising the need for strengthened international
co-operation in fighting it in the aftermath of the bomb attacks on Jewish
targets in London and Buenos Aires.

<TEXT>
Strikes and violent protests against the detention of Mr Moshood Abiola by
Nigeria's military regime spread across the country yesterday, while in
Abuja's high court Mr Abiola's trial for treason stalled over technicalities
and was adjourned until next Tuesday.
Mr Abiola, widely regarded as winner of last year's annulled presidential
election, was arrested by General Sani Abacha's regime last month for
declaring himself president.
Yesterday the prosecution at the high court hearing changed one of its
charges, the defence asked for them all to be struck out and both sides
argued over legal procedures until the adjournment.
Half the seats in the tiny court were taken up by the two teams of lawyers,
one of whom told the judge 'democracy is on trial'.
Outside the court, protesters set fire to a barricade of tyres and clashed
with hundreds of armed police who had cordoned-off the streets. Many came
from the Yoruba-speaking south-west, Mr Abiola's stronghold.
Mr Jesse Jackson, the US envoy despatched to convey President Bill Clinton's
concern over the military's refusal to hand power to a civilian government,
met Gen Abacha and Mr Abiola, diplomats said.
Details of his discussions were not known.
In the commercial capital, Lagos, protests were marred by violence and
looting. Lagos has been almost at a standstill since a three-week-long oil
workers' strike halted fuel distribution. The protest has been backed by
other unions, closing factories and offices.
Many banks are shut and the number remaining in the clearing system is
falling. Bankers predict cash shortages in the near future.
Shell Nigeria yesterday confirmed that its oil production, which accounts
for half of Nigeria's 2m barrels a day, had been cut by roughly 300,000 b/d
as a result of the oil workers' strike.
This has prompted a declaration of force majeure on loadings of crude oil by
Shell. The company stressed its adherence to 'business principles', a
reference to its unwillingness to maintain operations if a military guard
were needed.
Yesterday, air traffic controllers went on strike. All international flights
were cancelled as the military failed to replace civilians in the control
tower at Lagos airport.

Officials in South Korea yesterday expressed strong doubts about a claim by

bombs, John Burton reports from Seoul. They said there was no evidence to
support the claim by Mr Kang Myong-do, the son-in-law of the North Korean

to convert it into bombs. Similiar assessments were offered by officials in
Washington and Tokyo, although they did not totally dismiss Mr Kang's

Human Rights groups have accused Beijing of 'tightening the noose' on
dissidents following the US decision in May to renew China's most favoured
nation trading status and to de-link trade and human rights, Tony Walker
reports from Beijing. Human Rights Watch/Asia said in a 27-page report
issued today that the authorities had begun holding dissidents in 'prolonged
incommunicado detention' without informing their families of their
whereabouts or, in some cases, acknowledging their arrest. China also
promulgated new security laws in June just days after the MFN decision aimed
at 'further restricting the ability of activists to meet, speak and
organise.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The UN General Assembly voted yesterday to amend the Law of the Sea
convention to meet industrialised countries' objections to its seabed mining
rules, Michael Littlejohns reports from New York. The treaty will come into
force in November. As a result of the changes, the US, Britain, Germany,
Japan and other industrialised states are expected to sign it today.
They claimed the original seabed mining provisions were cumbersome,
restrictive and inimical to private enterprise. Changes in the treaty apply
clear free-market principles to seabed exploitation and protect mineral
producers and investors. But the special interests of poor developing
countries are still recognised. The treaty also allows states to create a
12-mile territorial sea limit and a 200-mile exclusive economic zone. The US
and Britain are still worried by the cost of new institutions to be set up,
including an International Seabed Authority.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Pergau dam loan to be renegotiated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The controversial subsidised loan provided by the UK government for the
Pergau dam project in Malaysia is being renegotiated, report Robert Peston
and James Blitz. Bankers said yesterday the Pounds 234m cash cost to the UK
government of providing the interest rate subsidy over 14 years may be
reduced. However, a banker stressed the initiative had come from Malaysia.
British officials regard it as a commercial request which does not
significantly alter the basis of the subsidy agreement struck in 1991.
Last year, a UK National Audit Office report criticised the method of
providing the subsidy chosen by the Overseas Development Administration,
saying the cost to the UK taxpayer would be Pounds 56m more than if a more
economical option had been chosen. The original Pergau loan of more than
Pounds 300m was provided by commercial banks headed by Schroders, the UK
merchant bank. It was made to Tenaga Nasional, the Malaysian electricity
authority, for the construction of a hydro-electric dam at Pergau, though
the loan was guaranteed by the Malaysian government. Tenaga pays a minimal
interest rate, but the commercial banks receive a market rate, thanks to the
UK government subsidy.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Zimbabwe's new budget aims to appeal to voters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HARARE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Zimbabwe was presented yesterday with a pro-investment, pro-growth and
pro-voter budget that cuts taxes, introduces incentives and narrows the
deficit but proposes no significant revenue measures.
The budget deficit in the fiscal year to the end of last month was cut to
7.9 per cent of gross domestic product from 11 per cent the previous year.
Mr Emmerson Mnangagwa, standing in for Dr Bernard Chidzero, finance
minister, who is ill, predicted a further reduction to 5 per cent in the
current year. This has been achieved largely by leaving some ZDollars 2.5bn
(Pounds 209m) of accumulated parastatal losses off the balance sheet,
including ZDollars 1bn needed to finance the country's strategic grain
reserve. If these losses are included, the 1993-94 budget deficit rises to
some ZDollars 5.5bn or 14 per cent of gross domestic product.
The government expects revenue to increase by 21 per cent in the current
year to June 1995 and spending by 13 per cent, or less than the likely
inflation rate.
Despite money supply growth of 40 per cent in the first five months of 1994,
the minister was confident that inflation will fall from 23.6 per cent last
month to 15 per cent by the end of the year and 10 per cent by mid-1995. He
predicted economic growth of 4.4 per cent this year, against 2.1 per cent
(revised) in 1993 and 5 per cent next year.
Tax changes include a reduction in company tax to 37.5 per cent from 40 per
cent (with effect from next April), abolition of import duties on all
capital goods imports, a cut in the import surcharge on all items from 15
per cent to 10 per cent, and the first significant attempt to adjust
personal tax rates for inflation.
The only tax increases are higher duties on opaque (traditional) beer and
soft drinks, although Mr Mnangagwa said he would widen the 10 per cent sales
tax to cover all services other than exempt activities to be announced
later.
Business will welcome creation of a cabinet committee on privatisation
charged with moving swiftly to privatise or commercialise parastatals, and
the announcement that the government expects to earn extra revenue this year
from the sale of unspecified assets.
Less encouraging is the failure to cut defence spending, despite promises by
President Robert Mugabe. It will rise by nearly 11 per cent this year, but
its share of the total budget falls slightly to 9.5 per cent from 9.7 per
cent.
Education takes the lion's share of the budget with more than 20 per cent,
while interest charges will absorb 18 per cent.
For the first time, too, a Zimbabwe finance minister acknowledged the
country's debt trap problem. Mr Mnangagwa said the country was now in the
'paradoxical' situation of having to borrow to meet interest payments.
While there is much in the budget that is positive, the fiscal situation
remains unhealthy with national debt rising 28 per cent in the last year
alone to Dollars 3.5bn.

South-east Asian governments will meet in Malaysia next week to co-ordinate
action against an Islamic sect whose growing influence has alarmed the
authorities in the Moslem countries of the region, Victor Mallet reports
from Bangkok.
The Al-Arqam movement, named after an early companion of the prophet
Mohammed in Mecca, is a mystical sect that believes in the imminent arrival
of an Islamic messiah. Called 'technological sufism' by some supporters,
Al-Arqam preaches basic Islamic values but also has extensive business
interests - including restaurants, software companies and advertising
agencies.
Malaysian police have detained 41 suspected Al-Arqam supporters in the past
week, accusing them of distributing pamphlets illegally. Indonesia is also
considering a ban, and the small Sultanate of Brunei has already outlawed
the group.

FT  29 JUL 94 / France rediscovers Indochina: Nostalgia is part of it, but
so is business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Perhaps that's what youth is, to believe that the world is made of
inseparable things: men and women, mountains and plains, humans and gods,
Indochina and France
So said Eliane Devries, the French plantation owner in Vietnam played by
Catherine Deneuve in the film Indochine.
Such films set in the colonial era - another is L'Amant, in which a French
schoolgirl has a passionate affair with a wealthy businessman from Saigon -
have encouraged thousands of sentimental tourists to visit France's former
colonies in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.
But the attachment to Indochina goes beyond mere nostalgia. Like the rest of
Europe, France has yielded to Japan the greater share of trade and
investment in Asia's other emerging economies; it hopes that in Indochina it
can recover lost ground and use its cultural, linguistic and historical ties
to build a solid base for French companies in the heart of Asia.
Little effort has been spared in this quest, especially in Vietnam, the most
important and populous of the three countries. France's President Francois
Mitterrand last year became the first western head of state to visit a
united Vietnam, and several French ministers have followed.
Mr Mitterrand openly criticised the US economic embargo of Vietnam (which
has since been lifted) and his government helped Hanoi with a bridging loan
to pay its arrears to the International Monetary Fund. Both gestures were
much appreciated by Vietnam's communist rulers, who began economic reforms
in the late 1980s and are now presiding over a fast developing but still
poor nation of 70m people.
The French embassy in Hanoi - which is being enlarged to cope with its
increased responsibilities - says France's aid to Vietnam doubled in each of
the last five years to reach nearly FFr500m (Pounds 60m) in 1993. France has
spent freely on promoting French language and culture.
Evidence of France's extensive commercial involvement in Vietnam is also
easy to find, from the oil exploration industry to the banking sector, from
the aircraft and crew leased to Vietnam Airlines by Air France to the
restored Sofitel-Metropole, the first luxury hotel in Hanoi.
France, with Dollars 436m worth of projects approved by Vietnam, is the
biggest European investor in the country - albeit behind Taiwan, Hong Kong,
Japan and other Asian investors - and its products account for a tenth of
Vietnam's imports. About 50 French companies have established offices in
Vietnam.
'All things being equal, if you put two companies side by side, the
Vietnamese would choose the French over the other, because they know the
French,' says Mr Joel Claude Grillot of Credit Lyonnais in Hanoi.
Few Vietnamese are nostalgic about the French colonial era which ended with
the communist victory at Dien Bien Phu in 1954, but the cultural ties
between the two countries are not merely a product of the French
imagination.
Apart from berets and baguettes, the Vietnamese inherited a love of
classical music from the French, and most residents of Hanoi are as
appreciative as the tourists of the city's broad boulevards and 19th century
French architecture. The Vietnamese language has absorbed numerous French
words; ga (gare) is the station, and xi mang (ciment) is cement.
'The French bathed us in blood and fire, they pillaged our country,' says Mr
Hoang Xuan Dien, a 70-year-old war veteran who speaks fluent French and has
relatives in France. 'But the true France brought us a very humanist culture
and we respect the true French - like Pasteur, for example.'
The Vietnamese government not only welcomes France's commercial involvement
and the dollars spent by French tourists, but also regards Paris as an
important international ally.
Facing an unfriendly China (an old enemy which invaded northern Vietnam
briefly in 1979) and a still-suspicious US (defeated in the mid-1970s),
Vietnam is anxious to make friends in Europe and around the world.
France, say Vietnamese diplomats, can provide the link not only to Europe
but also to the community of French-speaking nations - La Francophonie.
Vietnam is now bidding to host the 1997 francophone summit.
France's 'return to the Indochina stage' - the phrase used by Mr
Mitterrand's spokesman - has moved faster in Vietnam than in Laos or
Cambodia. In Laos, Australian and Thai investors are particularly active. In
Cambodia, France overreached itself by insisting that medical and other
students financed by French aid should be taught in the French language,
prompting demonstrations by students demanding to be taught in English, the
lingua franca of business in south-east Asia.
Cambodian officials, some of them brought up in France, also accused France
of making empty promises of substantial military aid for the fight against
Khmer Rouge guerrillas and then delivering only military advisers.
In both Cambodia and Vietnam, France has now softened its stand on the
language issue. French diplomats and aid officials in Hanoi and Phnom Penh
readily accept that English is the second language of choice after the local
language, while French can be a useful and enjoyable bonus.
Young Vietnamese will learn French if someone else is subsidising their
lessons and if they see a chance of a job in Europe or with a European
company, but the reality is that most French speakers in Vietnam learned the
language before 1954; about 700 students study French at the Alliance
Francaise in Hanoi, but most of its 6,000 members are elderly.
Even the supposed commercial benefits for France of its historical ties to
Indochina are a matter of debate. 'I don't think we're necessarily treated
favourably,' says Ms Fabienne Couty of the French embassy in Hanoi. 'The
Vietnamese are very pragmatic.'
That view is repeated at the Vietnamese foreign ministry by Mr Trinh Duc Du,
head of the western and northern Europe department. 'Business is business,'
he says.
In Indochine, Eliane's adopted Vietnamese daughter Camille, a communist
leader by the end of the film, puts it much more brutally: 'Your Indochina,'
she tells Eliane, 'no longer exists.'

FT  29 JUL 94 / Devaluation fears shake Egyptian pound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Egyptian pound yesterday rallied from a bout of panic selling sparked by
heightened fears of an imminent devaluation against the dollar, brokers and
bankers said.
The speculative rush jolted the currency to a low of EPounds 3.425 against
the dollar at one point on Wednesday, with the central bank entering the
market to buy pounds for dollars for the first time in several years.
Bankers said they estimated the central bank to have sold anywhere between
'tens of millions' and Dollars 200m dollars to support the pound. The
central bank declined to comment.
The bank, which has amassed foreign currency reserves of Dollars 16bn during
the past three years of economic reforms guided by the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank, has previously intervened only to buy
dollars and limit the rise in the pound, which has been bolstered by high
real interest rates.
However, brokers said the local market had been alarmed this week by a
report in al-Wafd, a liberal opposition newspaper, that the government and
the IMF had agreed in talks last week to devalue the pound to a rate of
EPounds 4 by the years' end. 'Basically the town ran dry of foreign
currency,' said one banker.
Dealers said the currency stabilised at EPounds 3.397 yesterday after a
series of senior Egyptian officials denied there were any plans to devalue
the currency. Dr Abdel Shakur Shalaan, Egypt's representative on the IMF
board, was quoted in local newspapers as saying reports of an imminent
devaluation were 'baseless'.
Egyptian officials claimed last month they were resisting strong pressure
from the Fund to devalue. Officials argued that whatever benefits such a
devaluation might have for Egypt's export competitiveness would be
outweighed by the damage to hard-won confidence in the currency.
The IMF is understood to have said that the pound was being held inflexibly
at a rate it calculated to be as much as 40 per cent overvalued relative to
Egypt's main trading partners. It is also believed to have sought
accelerated cuts in interest rates. The benchmark three-month treasury bill
rate is 12.2 per cent.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Japanese rise in output holds steady
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese industrial production rose in the three months to June for the
second consecutive quarter, the first time it has done this since the
downturn hit nearly three years ago.
Increased sales helped output in the second period to rise by 0.8 per cent
against the opening three months of the year, when production increased by
1.5 per cent, according to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
However, it warned that output might weaken in the third quarter, due to
price advantages given to imports by the yen's strength.
Output in June rose 2 per cent from the previous month, having fallen in
April and May. On an unadjusted basis it was stagnant in the year to June,
breaking a record 32 consecutive months of decline.
Manufacturing sales rose 4.1 per cent from May to June, contributing to a
decline in stocks of unsold goods. Miti's index of inventories to annual
sales fell by 4.1 per cent to 113.5 in June, not far above the 110 at which
the ministry believes stocks will be sufficiently reduced in line with
demand. Officials said stock reduction was in the final phase and posing
less of a drag on production.
Japanese business planned to reduce investment in plant and equipment by 3.2
per cent in the final quarter of the year, after a 2.8 per cent fall in the
third quarter and a 4.4 per cent decline in the second period.
This confirms that corporate investment has yet to bottom out, and that the
fragile signs of recovery are being supported mainly by personal spending.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Anti-personnel mine curb by UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government, faced with mounting evidence of the tragedy caused by
anti-personnel mines, has announced a ban on the export of all such weapons,
except high-technology models which are primed to self-destruct.
The 'self-destructing' variety of mine is supposed to avoid the risk of
civilians being accidentally killed after hostilities have ceased.
More than 100m mines have been scattered around the battlefields of the
world, and the United Nations estimates that at least 800 people die every
month as a result of stepping on them. Worst affected countries include
Afghanistan, Angola, Cambodia and Iraq.
Britain has not in practice sold any mines since 1985. However, this week's
announcement is apparently intended to bolster the UK's authority in
international negotiations over the trade. It amounts to an undertaking that
sales of the cruder variety of mine will not be resumed for an indefinite
period.
It does, however, leave open the possibility of developing and exporting the
self-destructing model. The Mines Advisory Group, a British charity which
helps clear minefields, described the decision as 'cynical and misleading'.
It said the failure rate of self-destructing mines was unacceptably high.
More than 1m supposedly self-destructing mines had remained live after the
Gulf war, and similar weapons dropped on Laos by US aircraft 25 years ago
were still claiming lives. The Foreign Office said it would be encouraging
other countries to follow its example and abide by an agreed code of conduct
on mine exports. Italy, the world's third largest exporter of anti-personnel
mines, recently promised a blanket ban on their production and export.
US and UK policy has focused more on a 'technical solution' to the question
of mines, arguing that it is possible to calibrate the weapons in such a way
as to make them harmless after their military purpose has been served.

FT  29 JUL 94 / One strike and they're out: ball players are set to walk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Baseball players in the top US professional league will down their bats,
balls and gloves on August 12 for an indefinite period if negotiations with
team owners over pay and other issues do not lead to the signing of a new
labour contract.
If the strike goes ahead, it will be the first baseball stoppage since 1988,
and the eighth in 22 years.
It also be especially ill-timed, because baseball's popularity this season
was beginning to recover from years of decline thanks to outstanding
performances by players who were threatening to rewrite the record books.
At least three young stars are currently on course to surpass the sport's
most hallowed record - the 61 home runs hit by Roger Maris of the New York
Yankees in 1961.
Yet this strike may make history of a different kind: it could be the
longest stoppage ever. Previous disputes have proved short-lived because the
owners quickly caved in to the players' demands. This time, baseball pundits
fear the stadiums could remain shut until the season ends in late September,
and perhaps even into next year, such is the lack of common ground between
the two sides.
The dispute involves the use of television and attendance revenues, and the
owners' insistence that a new labour contract includes a salary cap  - a
limit on how much each team is allowed to spend on player salaries.
The owners say rapidly increasing salaries have put clubs, especially those
in smaller cities, under a great financial strain, and argue that the sport
will only prosper over the long term if players agree to a cap and to split
revenues 50-50. Currently, there is no limit on how much each club can spend
on players, who receive about 58 per cent of total revenues.
The players' union, however, believes the cap would cost its members
millions of dollars in lost earnings and destroy free agency - the system
which allows them to move freely between clubs under certain conditions.
Since the union won the right to free agency in the mid-1970s, the average
player's salary has risen from just over Dollars 50,000 to Dollars 1.2m
(Pounds 770,000).
The union has also proposed that the minimum salary be raised from Dollars
109,000 to Dollars 175,000-Dollars 200,000, and that the rights to salary
arbitration be restored to players with two years of service in the major
leagues. The owners, however have rejected these proposals, claiming they
would cost clubs Dollars 1.57bn-Dollars 1.65bn over seven years.
Fans, meanwhile, view the developments with increasing disbelief. Many see
the dispute as a row over money between greedy millionaires (the players)
and greedy billionaires (the owners).
This week a group called 'Fans First' called for people to boycott a day of
baseball games next month in protest at the players' and owners' behaviour.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Former White House legal counsel Mr Bernard Nussbaum denied yesterday that
he had tried to persuade Mr Roger Altman, the deputy Treasury secretary, not
to disqualify himself from jurisdiction over the Arkansas savings and loan
institution at the heart of the Whitewater affair.
But Mr Nussbaum said he had reminded Mr Altman in February that the
Treasury's own lawyers had already determined that there was no 'legal or
ethical reason' why Mr Altman should step aside, his longstanding friendship
with President Bill Clinton notwithstanding. 'I left it to him to make his
own decision,' Mr Nussbaum added.
Mr Nussbaum explained that he was particularly concerned about the 'bad
precedent' of government officials prematurely excusing themselves from
their responsibilities at even the hint of conflict of interest.
At precisely the same time, he went on, Ms Ricki Tigert, nominated to run
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, was being pressed by Congress to
excuse herself from anything even remotely connected with Mr Clinton, whom
she had known for years. She has still not been confirmed.
The exact nature of the discussions between the White House and Treasury
between last September and this February emerged as the focus of Republican
questioning during the second day of the House banking committee's hearings
on the 'Washington end' of Whitewater, which involves the first family's
land and financial dealings in Arkansas.
This attention was hardly surprising given a front page article in the New
York Times predicting a shake-up in the Treasury high command as a result of
internal tensions generated by apparently conflicting recollections of who
said what, when and to whom.
Mr Altman appears the most vulnerable, though the White House this week
expressed confidence in him.
But Mr Bentsen, previously above the Whitewater fray, was reported to be
displeased with Mr Altman's conduct, while Ms Jean Hansen, the Treasury
legal counsel, was portrayed as being increasingly isolated as both Mr
Bentsen and Mr Altman disputed her version of contacts between the White
House and Treasury. All three are due to testify next week.
Mr Nussbaum gave nothing away and repeatedly denied even the suspicions of
impropriety.
While Democrats on the banking committee, chaired with an iron hand by
Congressman Henry Gonzalez, remained supportive, Republicans refined their
attacks by the process of having several members yield their allotted five
minutes of questioning to Congressman Bill McCollum of Florida, long a
leading Whitewater critic.
Mr Nussbaum testily denied assertions by Mr McCollum and Congressman Jim
Leach of Iowa that he had acted more as the president's personal lawyer than
as legal adviser to the office of the presidency.
But it would have been a dereliction of the latter duty, he argued, if the
White House were not kept abreast of issues which might involve the
president, putting it in a better position to respond to inquiries from the
media.
Thus, last September, it was his duty to know that the affairs of Madison
Guaranty, the Arkansas savings and loan, had been referred for possible
criminal prosecution to the Justice Department, with at least the chance
that Mr Clinton, though not the subject of the referral, could be called as
a witness.
'What this involved to me was some possible illegal or improper campaign
contributions,' he said. 'Politicians, presidents, congressmen get thousands
of contributions. Somebody may have made improper contributions. This is the
president and I recognise we may get press inquiries, but this was not. . .
a big deal.'

FT  29 JUL 94 / Compromise deal on US crime bill: Negotiators agree tough
measures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEREMY KAHN

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
House and Senate negotiators reached a compromise yesterday on tough
anti-crime legislation that will put thousands more police on US streets,
ban several types of assault guns and impose harsher sentences on criminals.
The huge crime bill, which will cost Dollars 30bn (Pounds 19.3bn) to
implement, is a top priority of the administration. It passed both
congressional chambers earlier this year in differing forms, but a
House-Senate conference committee, responsible for reconciling the two
versions, was deadlocked for weeks over several controversial provisions.
The negotiators worked unsuccessfully through Wednesday night, unable to
reach a compromise until mid-morning yesterday.
In the end, they kept the ban on 19 brands of assault weapon, passed by both
House and Senate, but adamantly opposed by Mr Jack Brooks, House chairman of
the conference committee. The negotiators dropped the so-called racial
justice provision that would have allowed minority defendants to challenge
the death penalty by using statistical evidence that capital punishment is
imposed more often on blacks and minorities.
The influential Congressional Black Caucus strongly supported the racial
justice measure, but Senate Republicans threated to use a filibuster to kill
a bill that included it. The Black Caucus now says it will oppose a
procedural vote needed to bring the crime bill to the House floor, but not
the bill itself.
The legislation also helps local communities hire 100,000 more police
officers, gives states grants to build more prisons, sets up special courts
to deal with first-time drug offenders, and increases from two to about 60
the number of federal crimes for which the death penalty can be imposed.
It also mandates life sentences for third-time offenders whose last
conviction was for a violent or drug-related crime, allows federal
prosecutors to treat offenders as young as 13 as adults in particularly
brutal cases, and makes gender-based violence against women a civil rights
violation. Gender-based crimes include spouse beating and stalking.
With the Clinton administration pushing hard for the bill, and members of
Congress - many of whom are up for re-election in November - eager to prove
to their constituents that they are tough on crime, the bill is expected to
sail through both chambers in the next week. A vote in the House could come
as early as today.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Guatemala rights agreement fails to take root
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GUATEMALA CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Only four months after the Guatemalan government and left-wing guerrillas
signed a human rights agreement, violations have increased. The United
Nations has also yet to install a monitoring mission as stipulated in the
accord.
Political killings, disappearances and kidnappings have doubled in the first
six months of this year compared to the equivalent period in 1993, according
to the Roman Catholic Church's human rights office.
Sightings of tortured bodies on the streets of Guatemala City are becoming
more frequent, and the army has continued to recruit youths forcibly in
rural areas, violating last March's agreement.
Bureaucratic delays at the UN have stalled the deployment of a mission to
verify the application of the agreement, say officials, despite a reported
commitment by the UN to set up a mission by the end of June.
The guerrillas of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity thought they
had won a small victory by insisting on immediate UN verification in the
face of long-standing opposition from the powerful Guatemalan army.
They have now threatened to suspend talks. 'If the minimum conditions
established in the Global Agreement on Human Rights are not met, it is not
possible to continue in a process of negotiation,' they said in a statement
in national newspapers last week.
The delay has led to complaints by local human rights groups that the
international community appears more concerned about keeping to a tight
agenda to end the conflict than in fostering the conditions for lasting
peace where basic rights are respected.
'They are only interested in a ceasefire, not in seeing a resolution of the
substantive issues which are considered to have originated and fuelled the
armed conflict,' says Monsignor Rodolfo Quesada, a former peace mediator.
The two sides who have been negotiating an end to the 33-year civil war for
three years agreed in January on a timetable to sign a final peace agreement
in December. Since then they have made strong advances, most recently in
Oslo last month when they agreed on the establishment of a 'truth
commission' to document human rights violations.
But the commission has been criticised as merely symbolic by human rights
activists, including the Nobel Peace Prize-winner Ms Rigoberta Menchu,
because it will fall short of naming individuals responsible for abuses, and
will not provide a moral sanction. Its role will merely be to document
events.
About 150,000 people have died in Guatemala's internal conflict, mostly
killed by the security forces, according to human rights groups.
Sources close to the talks say the guerrillas were extremely reluctant to
agree to a commission with such small teeth, but were overwhelmed by
pressure from the UN and the international community.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Cardenas fails to inspire, but is still a threat on poll
legitimacy: Trailing third, the left's man talks of civil protest if there
is electoral fraud - Mexican Elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
He campaigns tirelessly around Mexico's countryside and cities, going to as
many as 10 rallies in a 14-hour day. He almost never smiles, his face deadly
earnest as he relentlessly criticises the governing party and what he sees
as the country's deteriorating economic and social conditions.
Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, presidential candidate of Mexico's leftist
Democratic Revolutionary party, was for a long time considered the most
serious threat to Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) in the
election next month. He came close to winning the presidency in 1988, is the
son of Mexico's most revered president, and offers the clearest alternative
to the PRI.
But with less than a month to go before the election on August 21, Mr
Cardenas is now trailing a distant third in the opinion polls, and victory
looks beyond his reach. Unlike in 1988, his campaign has generated little
excitement, and his calls for social justice and democratic transition have
largely fallen on deaf ears.
His solemnity and lifeless style contrast sharply with the fiery Diego
Fernandez de Cevallos, the presidential candidate of the centre-right
opposition and at present the main, if distant, threat to Mr Ernesto Zedillo
of the ruling party. Even some aides to Mr Cardenas admit their
disappointment with his campaign, and despite the recent moderation of his
economic polices, his inability to appeal to younger, middle-class voters.
'The government has convinced the upper and middle classes that Cardenas
would be disastrous for them.' says Mr Adolfo Aguilar, Mr Cardenas's
spokesman. 'We have failed to come up with a strategy to counter this.'
Mr Cardenas's popularity, which had steadily fallen since the 1988 election,
plunged after the first ever television debate held between the country's
main presidential candidates more than two months ago. He failed to respond
to harsh attacks on his record as governor of the state of Michoacan, and
was widely perceived as weak and inarticulate.
But even in third place, Mr Cardenas represents a threat to the ruling
party's hopes of taking power in a peaceful environment. While the other
opposition leaders appear ready to accept a PRI victory, Mr Cardenas has
been adamant in his refusal to legitimise an electoral system he believes is
biased in favour of the governing party.
Last week Mr Cardenas refused to sign a pre-electoral pact of civility with
the PRI, saying he would await the outcome before agreeing to sign any
accord. Recently he has attacked Mr Jorge Carpizo, the interior minister,
for being too partisan to the PRI, and was alone in rejecting the
government's appointment of a new special prosecutor for electoral affairs.
He says that if there is fraud in the election, he will mount a campaign of
civil protests - as he did in 1988. Although he denies that a threat is
intended, he has agreed to send observers to attend a convention on
democracy next month hosted by rebel Zapatistas in the state of Chiapas,
raising fears of possible co-operation between his party and the Mayan
insurgents.
'He could get up to 7m votes,' says one official from the PRI. 'If he can
mobilise 5 per cent of that after the election then there could be trouble.'
Since the debate Mr Cardenas has focused his campaign on poorer agricultural
parts of the country. His hope is that the steady fall of incomes and
impoverishment of most agricultural workers over recent years will loosen
the ruling party's hold on the rural vote.
On the stump, Mr Cardenas attacks the government's policies of reducing
agricultural subsidies and allowing communal farmers to sell their plots to
private landowners. He said in a recent interview that subsidies and land
reform enabled agriculture to prosper for so long and could do so again.
Mr Cardenas's electoral strategy is risky because the PRI traditionally has
dominated the rural areas, winning more than 65 per cent of the vote in more
than 80 of the 110 rural districts in the country in 1988. Mr Cardenas,
perhaps because fraud was more prevalent in the countryside, won the
overwhelming majority of his votes in the cities in 1988.
But with Mr Zedillo and Mr Fernandez clearly ahead in the cities, Mr
Cardenas has decided to gamble on a change in traditional voting patterns.
'We are hoping for a high proportion of the votes of farmers who have been
hurt by the current administration,' he said. 'I expect that we will have a
better chance of defending the vote this time in the countryside.'
If Mr Cardenas has his eyes on circumstances after the election, he may be
calculating that disgruntled peasant sympathisers will be ready to
demonstrate in his favour. Some Cardenas aides reckon the peasant revolt in
Chiapas at the beginning of the year may inspire poor farmers to join Mr
Cardenas in protests against electoral fraud.
Mr Cardenas is adamant that he will not endorse violence. But there seems
little doubt that if he believes fraud has robbed him of votes, he will
protest the result and challenge the legitimacy of the victor. What is
uncertain is how much support he will have.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Political motives help keep Greek carrier airborne
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Greek government has strong political motives for ensuring the survival
of Olympic Airways, the indebted state carrier. For a start, more than 4m
Greeks, living mostly in the US, Canada and Australia, travel home
frequently. They are courted as an important source of investment in Greece
and influence abroad.
Olympic lost Dr8.7bn (Pounds 23.6m) last year on long-haul routes to the US
and Australia, equivalent to 66 per cent of overall operating losses. But,
in arguing for approval of its subsidies to Olympic, the Greek government
persuaded the European Commission that New York and Sydney flights should be
retained under the airline's restructuring plan, approved earlier this week,
because they help maintain cultural links and boost trade.
Greek migrants' remittances and shipping income, the Greek negotiators
pointed out, together bring in more than Dollars 4bn a year, equal to almost
two-thirds of Greek export earnings.
US carriers are willing to operate direct flights to Greece only in the
summer tourist season. Seasonality is one of Olympic's problems. Traffic is
concentrated between June and September, when passenger loads are close to
maximum. In the winter, domestic flights to the Greek islands may be
two-thirds empty.
Nevertheless, Olympic is obliged to serve island routes year-round, unlike
foreign charter operators which fly between April and October and switch
destinations from year to year according to tourist demand.
The government argues that a regular air service is important to keep Greek
island communities alive. Population of the Aegean islands has stabilised
over the past decade, after 20 years of decline. More than 20 island
airports are now able to handle medium-sized passenger jets.
In addition, Greece's dispute with Turkey over control of Aegean airspace
means that maintaining flights to the eastern Aegean islands, close to the
Turkish coast, is seen as vital to the national interest.
Aside from politics, Greek passengers on international flights show a
surprising degree of loyalty to their national carrier, considering its
record on punctuality and customer service is considered the poorest among
European Union airlines.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Tug-of-war over Italian PM's brother
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Lawyers were yesterday involved in a tug-of-war with Milan magistrates to
prevent the imprisonment on corruption charges of Mr Paolo Berlusconi,
younger brother of the Italian prime minister, Mr Silvio Berlusconi.
Milan magistrates issued an arrest warrant for Mr Paolo Berlusconi on
Tuesday, alleging his involvement in paying bribes totalling L330m (Pounds
136,500) to members of the Guardia di Finanza, the financial police, over
tax inspections of his brother's Fininvest group.
The arrest warrant continued yesterday to cause nervousness in the financial
markets about the stability of the right-wing coalition government. The lira
was fluctuating below the psychological floor of L1,000 against the D-Mark,
but recovered slightly to L1,003 in late trading.
Anti-corruption magistrates in Milan have insisted on detention of the
42-year-old Paolo Berlusconi on the grounds that he might tamper with
evidence.
Two weeks ago the coalition introduced a decree which limited the
judiciary's powers to use preventive detention. However, the Milan
magistrates, who were then investigating the Fininvest media empire,
threatened to resign - a threat which was largely responsible for forcing
the government to withdraw the decree five days later.
Mr Paolo Berlusconi is one of four people linked with Fininvest whose arrest
has been ordered since Friday. Only one of these, Mr Salvatore Sciascia,
head of the group's tax and accounting department, has surrendered himself.
It was largely on the basis of Mr Sciascia's confessions that Mr Paolo
Berlusconi was implicated for approving the payment of money to members of
the Guardia di Finanza between 1989 and 1992.
Milan magistrates were yesterday also seeking to establish the precise
managerial role played by Mr Silvio Berlusconi while he was head of
Fininvest and before he entered politics in last January.
They are believed to be investigating ownership of the Telepiu cable
television channel. They are checking whether Mr Berlusconi had a larger
than declared stake through nominees. If this were proved, the prime
minister could risk losing his commercial television licences.
At the political level Mr Berlusconi has begun preparing to defend his role
in the growing confrontation with the judiciary which has so weakened his
government. He is scheduled to lead a parliamentary debate next Tuesday.
In the meantime, he has rejected a suggestion by Mr Gianfranco Fini, leader
of the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance, to remove from government all
those linked to Fininvest. The advice from Mr Fini, until now his most loyal
partner in the coalition, underlines how isolated Mr Berlusconi has become
over the Fininvest affair.
Reuter adds: Mr Silvio Berlusconi will present a plan today to have a
special committee oversee his businesses, according to political sources who
declined to be named.
They said the plan called for President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and the heads
of the two houses of parliament to name the oversight committee. Managers of
Mr Berlusconi's companies would still have powers of decision, but would
need to have their actions approved by the committee.
'It's a real separation of powers. It will cut all links between Berlusconi
and his company,' one said.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Berlusconi's troubles rebound on Bank of Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Berlusconi government has failed to resolve the delicate issue of
nominating a new director-general for the Bank of Italy, letting the matter
slip until September.
The bank's higher council, responsible for making the formal nomination, had
been expected to agree yesterday on a replacement for Mr Lamberto Dini, who
became treasury minister after last spring's general election. But Mr
Antonio Fazio, the bank's governor, failed to signal that the council would
be called in extraordinary session; only such a meeting can determine who
will hold the number two job at the bank.
The postponement is a further sign of the difficulties faced by Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, prime minister. It was only this week, after two months'
wrangling among the right-wing coalition partners, that the compromise
choice of Mr Michele Tedeschi was agreed to head Iri, the main state holding
company.
Attempts to find an acceptable successor to Mr Dini have come up against
competing interests in the Bank of Italy and the government. Although the
13-man higher council chooses the replacement, their choice must be
confirmed by the head of state in conjunction with the prime minister and
treasury minister. In the wake of the council's previous abortive meeting at
the start of the month, the government issued a strongly worded statement
asserting its right to make nominations to senior posts at the bank. This
right was not to be confused with the bank's autonomy, the statement
insisted.
However, the Bank of Italy continues to press for someone from within the
institution, preserving both tradition and a sense of autonomy. The logical
successor, in hierarchical terms, would be Mr Tommaso Padoa Schioppa, the
senior of the two deputy director-generals. But the government regards him
as too close to Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, who resigned as bank governor to
become prime minister in 1993 and who promoted Mr Fazio above Mr Dini.
The government wants to introduce new blood to the bank. Its favoured
candidate has been Mr Rainer Masera, a former head of its research
department, liberal economist and currently in charge of Imi, the
state-controlled financial group.
A compromise which would give the vacant job to Mr Vincenzo Desario, the
junior deputy governor who is close to Mr Fazio, has yet to find support.
But the weaker the government becomes, the more Mr Fazio is likely to get
his way.
The debate over the choice of a replacement reflects not on the quality of
the respective candidates but rather on whom each person is seen to
represent. Whatever the outcome, relations between the government and the
bank risk being damaged.
Good links between the two have become all the more important as the economy
begins to recover from recession and as the government crisis produces
speculative pressure on the lira that could force up interest rates.

FT  29 JUL 94 / MMM case makes Russia revise share rules: Imminent collapse
of pyramid scheme exposes failure of government regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian government yesterday said it would devise rules to regulate
share trading, as the country's best known company, the MMM finance house,
tottered on the verge of a collapse which would ruin the dreams of large
numbers of its shareholders.
They are unlikely to be compensated, certainly not in full, if the pyramid
investment organisation collapses - though Mr Sergei Dubinin, the acting
finance minister, has been put in charge of a committee which will see what
can be done.
The cabinet meeting called to consider the crisis at MMM - which now has an
estimated 20,000 people waiting around its Moscow headquarters to trade in
their shares - heard an astonishing litany of government insouciance in the
face of MMM's activities.
By their own account, ministers and senior officials had allowed a company
to continue trading which broke a number of existing laws every day of its
operation.
It had not paid Rbs49.9bn of tax and had not maintained or shown to the
authorities proper records, according to Mr Vladimir Gusev, head of the
taxation service. It continued to sell shares through a company named Russia
House Selengha, despite a ban on such trading by the supreme arbitration
court.
It has also, according to Mr Gusev, not registered itself with the finance
ministry, in spite of a law which obliges all companies which issue more
than Rbs1bn of shares to do so, and in spite of government estimates that it
sold Rbs4bn of shares each day, according to Mr Andrei Vavilov, the first
deputy finance minister.
Nor has it responded to requests from the anti-trust committee for
interviews, according to Mr Leonid Bochin, head of the anti-trust committee
Mr Oleg Soskovets, first deputy prime minister, criticised officials for
splitting up control of the securities market and thus confusing the issue.
The huge crowd of people round its headquarters swelled overnight - though
the crowd appeared relatively peaceful in the warm Moscow sun. Touts were
passing through the crowd offering around Rbs80,000-Rbs90,000 for MMM shares
as the black market price rose from around Rbs40,000-Rbs50,000 after company
spokesmen promised that the buying and selling points would re-open today
with Rbs125,000 to be offered for the shares - up from Rbs115,000 which was
the last price quoted by MMM last week.
However, the possibility that the crowd might turn violent or that the
government might be blamed for the collapse was clearly present in
ministers' minds - the more so since a representative of the Consumers'
Federation, invited to the cabinet meeting, advised ministers to prop up MMM
since its collapse would mean that 'total responsibility for it would fall
on the government'.
Mr Sergei Mivrodi, the elusive MMM chairman, has threatened to use his
claimed 10m shareholders to force a referendum on the future of the
government (for which only 1m signatures are required).  MMM Consultancy
Group Ltd of Basingstoke, a resource management and logistics consultancy,
would like it to be known that they have no connection whatsoever with the
MMM company in Moscow.

A large majority of voters throughout the European Union support the
European parliament's new powers to vet members of the European Commission,
according to an EU-wide opinion poll published yesterday. According to the
survey, carried out by the European Commission as part of its regular
Eurobarometer series, 73 per cent of EU voters say the president and members
of the Commission should hold office only if they are supported by a
majority in the Strasbourg parliament. Only 9 per cent oppose this view, the
survey indicates. Following its narrow vote in favour of Mr Jacques Santer,
designated to take the Commission presidency in January, the parliament is
due to hold nomination hearings with proposed commissioners in the autumn.

<TEXT>
A report on alleged irregularities in the Irish beef trade is due to be
presented to the Irish government today, with potentially embarrassing
repercussions for Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, who was
agriculture minister during some of the period under investigation. The
report is expected to answer questions raised during the inquiry regarding
Mr Reynolds' prudence in providing unprecedented levels of export credit
insurance for beef exports to Iraq. Mr Dick Spring, foreign minister, who
leads the Labour half of a coalition government with Mr Reynolds' Fianna
Fail party, is understood to have made allegations about Mr Reynolds in
evidence given to the inquiry, which sat between June 1991 and July 1993.
The Irish government will discuss the findings of the inquiry, which is
understood to have cost IPounds 25m (Pounds 24.7m), at a special meeting
next week.

FT  29 JUL 94 / France trims key interest rate

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of France yesterday trimmed its key short-term interest rate by
one-tenth of a percentage point, to 5 per cent, in a further easing of
monetary policy. The cut in the intervention rate, the floor for money
market rates, was consistent with the central bank's strategy of tracking
the German repo rate lower while maintaining a gap of 15-25 basis points.
Yesterday's move leaves France's intervention rate 15 basis points above the
repo rate. Economists in Paris said another cut appeared unlikely in the
next month as the Bundesbank had frozen the repo rate until at least the
last week of August.

<TEXT>
Ambassadors to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
removed the question of who should become the new head of the institution
from the agenda of a council meeting yesterday, delaying a decision until
September. The OECD's 25 members have been divided for months over which of
four candidates should become secretary-general when the second five-year
mandate of Mr Jean-Claude Paye expires in September. Mr Donald Johnston -
former head of Canada's Liberal party who has the backing of the US, Japan
and, according to his supporters, at least 10 other countries - is believed
to be the leading candidate. Mr Paye, who is seeking a third term, is said
to be the second favourite, with Lord Lawson, former British chancellor of
the exchequer, behind him. Diplomats said the fourth candidate, Germany's
top trade negotiator Mr Lorenz Schomerus, appears to be out of the running.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Credit Lyonnais yesterday seized most of Mr Bernard Tapie's valuable 18th
century furniture and pictures from his Paris mansion in order to sell them
as part repayment of the FFr1.2bn (Pounds 144m) which the
businessman-politician owes the bank. Mr Tapie denounced the seizure as
'illegal and politically motivated'. In March Credit Lyonnais agreed to
spread repayment of Mr Tapie's debts over four years, but it claims Mr Tapie
has since failed to honour provisions relating to his mortgaged furniture.
Mr Tapie claims the bank breached the March debt accord, an argument which
his lawyers will put to a court hearing in late October, at which Credit
Lyonnais is separately seeking to recover FFr237m of its loans. Mr Tapie
claimed yesterday that he had enough assets to cover his debts.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Brussels clears BT-MCI link
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission has cleared an alliance between British Telecom and
MCI, the US operator, to provide global telecom services to multinational
companies. The ruling, which remains in effect until the year 2000, removes
the last serious regulatory hurdle to the deal which US authorities approved
earlier this month. The ruling yesterday is the first in-depth examination
by Brussels of global alliances in the fast growing telecom market.
The ruling covers the plan by BT to take a 20 per cent stake valued at
Dollars 4.3bn (Pounds 2.77bn) in MCI and the proposed joint venture known as
Concert to provide services such as data transmission, video-conferencing
and global calling cards. The Commission said the BT stake in MCI was not a
threat to competition as BT had no possibility of controlling or influencing
MCI. On the other hand, it would restrict competition as the two companies
were at least 'potential competitors' in the market for value added services
and general telecommunications. It also found that the appointment of BT as
exclusive distributor of Concert within the European Economic Area (EEA) -
which covers the EU as well as Austria, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden
 -was anti-competitive. It has obtained an assurance that any user in the
EEA will be able to obtain Concert's services through MCI. In addition, a
provision intended to dissuade MCI from entering the EEA market will last
for five years.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Economic Watch: Dutch GDP outstrips forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Dutch gross domestic product rose 1.9 per cent in the first quarter of 1994
against the year-earlier period, outstripping a preliminary estimate of 1.3
per cent made in early June. The central statistical office said the upward
revision was largely due to the availability of more accurate foreign trade
figures, which showed a 7.1 per cent jump in the volume of goods and
services sold abroad in the first three months of the year. The 1.9 per cent
increase - the highest quarterly gain since a 3.3 per cent rise in the
opening period of 1992 - was also helped by a 2.5 per cent increase in
consumer spending. Purchases of new cars were particularly buoyant, rising
by about 25 per cent against the weak first quarter of 1993.
Spain's jobless total fell by nearly 30,000 in April-June, the first
seasonally adjusted quarterly growth in employment since the opening period
of 1991. The jobless total now stands at 3.7m, or 24.2 per cent of the
working population. Denmark's unemployment rate in June dropped to 12.3 per
cent of the workforce, from 12.4 per cent in May, according to figures
released yesterday. Poland's industrial output rose 9.9 per cent in the
first six months of this year compared with last year's period. Average
inflation over the six months fell to 31.3 per cent from 35.3 per cent in
the opening half of 1993.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Bosnian Serbs resist pressure as Russia and US at odds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By OUR FOREIGN and POLITICAL STAFF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bosnian Serbs reaffirmed objections to the latest peace plan for Bosnia
yesterday, as the plan's five sponsor nations remained at odds over ways to
enforce compliance.
The Bosnian Serbs' renewed display of ambiguity in the face of international
pressure came on the eve of a meeting in Geneva tomorrow of the five-nation
'contact group' pressing the peace plan - the US, Russia, Britain, France
and Germany.
Earlier General Pavel Grachev, Russian defence minister, said he was certain
the Bosnian Serbs would come round to accepting the plan.
The Russian minister's optimism was not shared by officials from other
contact group nations. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state,
characterised the initial qualified Serbian response last week as
'tantamount to a rejection'.
With the Americans and Russians divided over how to put pressure on the
Bosnian Serbs, and European governments nervous about their troops in
Bosnia, diplomats fear splits in the 'contact group' could ultimately lead
to an escalation of fighting.
In Britain, officials fear the US may take a harder line than others in the
contact group, urging extension of Nato's role in Bosnia and subsequent
lifting of the arms embargo.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, warned ministerial colleagues in
London yesterday that if Washington did not accept a more graduated approach
to increasing pressure on the Serbs, Britain could be forced into a rapid
withdrawal of its troops.
That warning was echoed publicly last night by Mr John Major, the prime
minister, who said that an escalation of the conflict resulting from removal
of the arms embargo would make the position of UN troops 'untenable'.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Flying the flag crowds the air: The problem at the heart of
airline competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To understand why air transport is one of the last industries to face the
rigours of competition in Europe, a good starting point is Terminal 2, at
London's Heathrow airport.
From the spectators' gallery overlooking the European hub, the picture is
clear. Spain's Iberia sits alongside Air France. Germany's Lufthansa follows
the Dutch KLM carrier on to the runway. The blue insignia on the tail of
Belgium's Sabena pokes out from behind Italy's Alitalia.
'The biggest barrier to air transport liberalisation in Europe is this crazy
idea that every member state has to have its own airline,' said a European
Commission official. The result is that a relatively small land-mass is
supporting too many airlines.
Europe's state-owned airlines occupy the same place as flags, languages and
national anthems in the hearts of Europe's citizens. 'People still assume
there is something glamorous about flying,' said the official. 'But. . .
airlines are just glorified bus companies.'
National pride more than anything explains why, six months after a Brussels
committee urged Europe to speed up liberalisation of its airways, the
Commission was yesterday unable to veto the last of three cases of state-aid
to airlines to come before it this year - Air France, Greece's Olympic and
TAT of Portugal.
'It wasn't really a question of what Brussels believed, it was a question of
what it could get away with,' said an industry official yesterday.
To the horror of private airlines without state subsidies, such as British
Airways, and state-owned airlines that have restructured before
privatisation, such as Lufthansa, the Commission allowed the French
government to pump FFr20bn (Pounds 2.4bn) into the bankrupt Air France and
the Greek government to inject Dr54bn (Pounds 147m) into Olympic. Earlier
this month, the Portuguese Airline TAP was allowed to benefit from Es180bn
(Pounds 723m) of government money.
According to industry analysts, the decision to allow the French government
and others to have their way is merely prolonging the agony for airlines
that before long will have to face full-blown competition.
'FFr20bn is enough money to create a new airline from scratch,' said Mr
Kevin Murphy, airline analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York. 'That kind of
subsidy will only perpetuate the inefficiencies that already exist at Air
France.'
Yesterday the US administration made clear its dismay at the Brussels
decision.
'In the late 1980s and early 1990s, when PanAm and Eastern Airlines went
under,' said a US diplomat in Brussels, 'the US government resisted enormous
pressure to intervene. In the long run, US carriers and consumers are better
for it. The European Commission should have stood up to these subsidies in
the same way.'
The diplomat also noted that the Commission's conditions on state aid to Air
France left the door open for further aid and were not tough enough to
offset the 'negative and distortive effects' on competition.
The decision, and the other state-aid approvals, formed part of Brussels'
careful approach to liberalising this most sensitive of industries. Its
conclusions - in what looked like an attempt to steer a course between the
EU's liberalisers and more interventionist members  - argued that although
privatisation was the implicit answer to the industry's woes, a
restructuring period was necessary first.
The most recent hand-outs were thus the so-called 'one time-last time'
payments, which would allow carriers to get back on to a normal commercial
footing before privatisation.
The question now is how long the airlines can delay privatisation. The one
condition that Air France's rivals would have liked to have seen imposed by
the Commission would have been a definite date for privatisation. But none
was set. Mr Bernard Bosson, the French transport minister gave a vague
reassurance that privatisation would follow the three-year restructuring.
'What is happening now, is that everybody knows that the contraction of the
airline industry is inevitable in Europe,' said the Commission official.
'Governments are trying to make sure that when the fight finally comes,
their national carriers will be the ones that survive.'
Until then - so far British Airways and British Midland remain the only EU
'flag-carriers' to operate entirely privately - consumers will remain the
overall losers.
According to the report on which the Commission's decision was based,
European airlines' operating costs are about 48 per cent higher than those
of their US counterparts and total labour costs nearly 37 per cent higher.
In addition, global competition is hotting up. 'In the US, cost structures
are coming down even further, and that will affect European carriers'
competitive capability,' said Mr Murphy.
'It is obvious that not all the national carriers will survive,' Mr Peter
Hobel of Lufthansa said yesterday. 'Some will just end up servicing regional
traffic.'

FT  29 JUL 94 / US rejects over-counter sales for Tagamet drug
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tagamet, SmithKline Beecham's top-selling ulcer drug, should not yet be
cleared for non-prescription sales in the US, two advisory committees of the
Food and Drug Administration unanimously recommended yesterday.
The decision is a blow for the Anglo-American healthcare group, which had
been hoping to use over-the-counter sales to offset the expected rapid
decline in Tagamet revenues in the US after the expiry of its patents in
May.
Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, had been predicting worldwide
non-prescription sales for Tagamet of Pounds 100m by 1997. Tagamet is
already available without a prescription in the UK. SmithKline's shares
yesterday fell 11 1/2 p to 408p.
Another FDA advisory committee refused to recommend Rogaine, Upjohn's
baldness treatment, for sale without a prescription. The two rejections
reinforce industry concerns that the chances of extending drugs' revenues
after patent expiries through non-prescription sales are being jeopardised
by the FDA's increasing conservatism.
'This is a substantial setback for SmithKline Beecham. It's really important
to be first to the (over-the-counter) market with these new generation
drugs. The first (company) could generate annual US sales of Dollars 500m
(Pounds 322m) by 1995, the second Dollars 200m and the third Dollars 100m,'
said Mr Viren Mehtha of drugs analysts Mehtha &amp; Isalay.
This is the second time FDA advisory committees have refused to recommend
Tagamet.
The committees will today consider whether to recommend Pepcid for sale
without a prescription. The drug, marketed by Merck and Johnson &amp; Johnson of
the US, is one of Tagamet's main rivals. Another rival, Zantac, Glaxo
Holdings' top-selling product, is also being developed for non-prescription
use.
The committees were concerned about possible interactions of Tagamet with
two widely prescribed medicines - Upjohn's sleeping pill Halcion and
theopylline, an asthma treatment.
However, they said their concerns about the effectiveness of Tagamet for
heartburn, raised the last time they rejected the drug in September, had
been met.
Analysts said neither Zantac nor Pepcid had similar interactions with other
drugs.
SmithKline Beecham said it would conduct additional clinical trials to meet
the committees' concerns. The committees voted that the drug could be
licensed by the FDA without further intervention by them if their concerns
were met.
Mr Duncan Moore, pharmaceuticals analyst at brokers Morgan Stanley, said
Tagamet could eventually be licensed.

FT  29 JUL 94 / DTI will take no action against Archer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Trade and Industry announced last night that it would not
be taking any action against Lord Archer, former deputy chairman of the
Conservative party, after allegations that he had been involved in insider
dealing.
In a statement the DTI announced that Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, had considered a report into possible contraventions of
insider dealing legislation by Lord Archer at the time of the bid by MAI,
the entertainment and financial group, for Anglia television group in
January 1994.
The DTI said that 'on the basis of the report and departmental and other
independent legal advice' Mr Heseltine had concluded that his department
should take 'no further action against any of the parties concerned in the
investigation'.
Lord Archer - formerly Mr Jeffrey Archer - later told reporters: 'I am
grateful to have been exonerated and would like to thank so many friends,
colleagues and well-wishers for their vigorous support following disclosure
of the investigation.'
The best-selling popular fiction writer insisted throughout the DTI
investigation that he was innocent of the allegations. His wife, Mary, is a
non-executive director of Anglia TV.
Many Tory MPs believe that disclosure of the DTI inquiry into Lord Archer,
which was leaked to a newspaper, ensured he would not be given a job in last
week's government re-shuffle, although some believe a ministerial post is
still a possibility.
The DTI's subsequent decision to confirm that Lord Archer was under
investigation was unprecedented, and met strong criticism from Tory
backbenchers.
The DTI said last night that it would not be publishing the inspectors'
report into the allegations, which Mr Heseltine received on July 19. It also
said that information on the case would, as a formality, be passed to the
Stock Exchange and to the Securities and Futures Authority.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Watchdog curbs water charges: Ofwat chief unveils plan to
protect householders against sharp price rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, PEGGY HOLLINGER and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new price regime designed to curb recent sharp rises in household water
bills was unveiled yesterday by Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of Ofwat, the
water industry regulator.
The controls, known as K-factors, will limit future price increases to 1
percentage point a year above inflation for the next 10 years for the
average householder.
The 31 water companies in England and Wales, each of which enjoys a local
monopoly, will also be expected to finance more of their investments
themselves through greater efficiency.
Although the new K-factors were at the tougher end of industry expectations,
they were generally welcomed as fair in the industry and the City.
Most water company shares gained on the day. Only South West Water, said it
would exercise its right to appeal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The new K-factors are weighted to give companies more rapid price increases
in the first five years, when investments are heaviest. Average prices can
rise by 1.4 percentage points over inflation up to 2000. After that, the
average increment over inflation falls to 0.4 per cent.
But there are wide variations. Southern Water, which has heavy clean-up
costs on south coast beaches, is allowed 4 percentage points falling to 3
percentage points while four companies will not be allowed any real
increases at all in the last five years. These include South West Water,
which had one of the highest Ks last time and is now to be reined in.
Consumer groups gave the review a cautious welcome because it provided the
prospect of lower price increases, although it still meant water prices
would rise ahead of inflation. But it was attacked by environmental groups
which said it would inhibit much-needed clean-ups of rivers and beaches.
Yesterday's review marks the first reshaping of price controls for the water
industry since it was privatised in 1989.
Over that period, it has provoked controversy by raising charges by more
than inflation, while paying large increases in dividends to its
shareholders and rewarding its senior executives and directors with generous
remuneration packages.
The new controls are the outcome of a three-year review of prices and costs
which was intended to correct the failures of the price controls set at
privatisation.
In determining the K-factors, Mr Byatt said he had to allow companies enough
leeway to finance the improvements required to the water infrastructure and
the clean-up of rivers and beaches. These investments, largely imposed by
European Union directives, would total Pounds 24bn over the next 10 years.
He stressed, however, that his review was not concerned with the level of
profits and salaries, which remained a matter for company managements.
Companies were generally positive. 'It is a tough K determination,' said Mr
Brian Staples, the new chief executive of North West Water, which also got a
zero K for the last five years. 'Yet it strikes about the best possible deal
for customers given the amount of capital expenditure and provides companies
with the classical management challenge.'
Labour and the Liberal Democrats attacked the review, arguing it did little
to protect the long-term interests of the consumer or to crack down on
profits made by the water companies.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Sainsbury takes on Tesco in bid for Wm Low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The price war between the UK's biggest food retailers yesterday became a
bidding war as J. Sainsbury launched a counter-bid to Tesco's agreed offer
for the Scottish supermarket chain William Low.
Sainsbury's bid of 305p per share - the first time Britain's largest food
retailer has made a hostile bid - values Wm Low at Pounds 210m, a 36 per
cent premium to Tesco's offer of Pounds 154m, or 225p a share.
Tesco said yesterday it was considering its response and urged Wm Low
shareholders to take no action. Retailing analysts believe Tesco is likely
to raise its offer to 325p per share, possibly as early as today.
Expectations of a bidding war sent Wm Low's share price up 44p to 324p -
almost double the 169p price of the shares on the day before Tesco's bid,
two weeks ago. Sainsbury's shares rose 1p to 411p, but Tesco closed down 7p
at 233p.
Wm Low's directors said they would consider the Sainsbury offer in detail
and were in talks with both bidders.
A successful bid would raise Sainsbury's market share in Scotland from 3 per
cent to 10 per cent, and give it 45 stores in Scotland, 12 in northern
England, and a Scottish distribution depot.
Mr David Sainsbury, chairman, said his company was 'in the strongest
position to unlock the potential of Wm Low's stores'. He added: 'Our offer
provides a fair price to Wm Low's investors and if accepted will provide a
good return on investment to our shareholders.'
Mr Sainsbury insisted the bid was effectively not 'hostile'. The Scottish
supermarket chain, he added, had 'already endorsed an offer for its
purchase. The only question now is who the purchaser will be and what the
price will be'.
Sainsbury is proposing a Pounds 40m investment to bring Wm Low's stores up
to its own standards, and would assume Pounds 50m of debt. It said it would
operate a regional office in Scotland, but this would be much smaller than
Wm Low's head office, and 'significant job losses' among head office staff
were likely.
Sainsbury, advised by SG Warburg, is offering 305p in cash for each Wm Low
ordinary share, and 143p for each convertible preference share. A share
alternative is available.
Analysts believe Tesco may respond with an offer as high as 350p per share
to try to secure victory, but the consensus forecast is between 320p and
330p. They did not rule out a response by Sainsbury of 350p or above, but
feared a bid at that level might be earnings-dilutive.
'The egos involved are quite substantial,' remarked one analyst. 'That could
still push things a lot further.'

FT  28 JUL 94 / (CORRECTED) Opposition cries foul over Bombay scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 3rd August 1994) appended to this article.
Opposition leaders yesterday accused the Indian government of letting off
several cabinet ministers and bureaucrats criticised in a report on the
Bombay stock market scandal of 1992.
MPs stalled proceedings in both houses of parliament, rejecting what the
government called its 'Action Taken' report, which it said 'overturned' the
findings of a joint parliamentary committee into the scandal which reported
in December last year.
Its clause-by-clause response to the committee's report was tabled in
parliament on Tuesday.
The government rejected the committee's findings that it was, through
inaction by the finance ministry and the Reserve Bank, India's central bank,
responsible for 'a systems failure' that allowed the scandal to erupt.
Staunchly defending Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, the government
conceded that the scandal occurred because of a 'failure to check
irregularities', but insisted that 'this failure was not due to inaction' on
its part. The scandal, it said, highlighted 'weaknesses in the system' which
it was 'in the process of correcting'.
MPs who wrote the parliamentary committee report into the Rs40bn (Pounds
830m) scandal criticised failings throughout the financial system and held
Mr Singh responsible for the shortcomings of officials entrusted with
financial supervision.
The committee spent more than a year investigating the affair, which erupted
in April 1992 when evidence emerged that money was being illegally siphoned
out of banks and into the stock market.
Opposition members have demanded a withdrawal of the government's report,
terming it an 'eyewash' and an 'assault on parliamentary dignity'.
Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee, leader of the opposition from the Bharatiya Janata
party, said the entire nation expected that the government would accept the
parliamentary committee's report and take action against ministers, arrest
guilty officials and initiate proceedings against others.
'But no such action has been initiated.'
Mr Lal Krishen Advani, the Hindu party's president, yesterday accused Mr P V
Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, of 'shielding corruption'.
On Monday the Reserve (central) Bank of India announced that it would impose
penalties on several foreign and domestic banks indicted by the committee's
report and its own investigations.
The Reserve Bank has penalised 35 Indian and foreign banks by withdrawing
the exemption granted to 78 commercial banks in April 1992 from maintaining
a cash reserve ratio of 10 per cent. The Reserve Bank, which already holds
deposits worth Rs300bn from these banks, will by its decision, impound a
further Rs30bn, 10 per cent of the incremental growth of these deposits, by
virtue of the waiver.
Further, 20 of the 35 banks involved in the scandal have been served notices
by the central bank for allegedly violating regulations. They have four
weeks to contest the Reserve Bank's claims, failing which they will have to
pay penalties totalling Rs1.47bn.
Worst hit among the domestic banks is India's largest nationalised bank, the
State Bank of India, which will have to pay a penalty of Rs112m. Among the
foreign banks, Citibank may have to pay Rs500m in fines.
Other foreign banks affected include ANZ Grindlays, Standard Chartered,
American Express Bank, Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, Deutsche Bank, Credit
Lyonnais, Barclays Bank of Nova Scotia, and the Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank.
Representatives of foreign banks, who say it is too early to tell whether
they will contest the Reserve Bank's claims, are more concerned about what
one Bombay-based banker termed 'continuing harassment'.
'The government has clearly said in its report on Tuesday that the Reserve
Bank is finalising further action against the foreign banks involved in the
scandal,' he said. 'We have done everything in our power to stop the
irregularities, if any, and the government would be giving us the wrong
signal if they continue to slap on penalties.'
A senior Reserve Bank official said yesterday that 'the bank as an
organisation would end the matter here provided the banks don't contest our
claims and pay the penalties due'.
The official said the central bank would grant the 20 banks involved private
hearings if any mistakes were detected in calculations or the banks felt the
penalties were too harsh.
CORRECTION
The Financial Times of July 28 reported on international banks implicated in
the Bombay financial scandal. Barclays Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia, Credit
Lyonnais and the Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank were listed in error.

Willi Betz, the German transport company, is buying 55 per cent of Somat,
Bulgaria's long-distance trucking company in the biggest foreign investment
in the country's privatisation programme.
The German group is paying Dollars 55m for its majority stake and will
invest a further Dollars 48m over the next seven years. The state will
retain 25 per cent and the remaining 20 per cent will be offered to
employees.
Alpha Transport of France, the competitor for the deal, complained it was
not treated on equal terms with its rivals. Both foreign companies have been
working with Somat since the 1970s.
Somat used to have a commanding position on the route from the Gulf to
Western Europe but war and sanctions in the Gulf and former Yugoslavia
disrupted the routes.
However, the company still controls half the European road haulage market to
the Middle East, according to estimates. Somat is recovering its markets in
Russia and the CIS.

<TEXT>
Bank Austria, the country's largest bank, has reported a 20 per cent slide
in pre-tax profit in the first half to Sch2.1bn (Dollars 189m) due to a
slump in trading income.
But the bank expects an unchanged pre-tax result in the full year, as higher
lending margins in the second half offset lower profits from trading. It
also said provisions for bad loans would be about 10 per cent lower than
last year's Sch3.8bn.
Net interest income in the first half was flat at Sch6.06bn as loan demand
remained slack. Partial operating profit (pre-tax profit excluding own
account trading) was up 5.5 per cent to Sch1.8bn, mainly due to lower
transaction taxes. But trading income fell 66.6 per cent to Sch291m, causing
the sharp decline in pre-tax profit.
Comparative figures were adjusted to remove the extraordinary charges last
year for reforming the employee pension fund.

<TEXT>
Mercedes-Benz has indirectly stepped up its presence in the moribund Polish
truck and bus industry following the signing of an initial agreement for the
sale of Jelcz, the state-owned truck manufacturer to Sobieslaw Zasada
Centrum (SZC) the local Mercedes-Benz dealer.
The SZC offer to purchase 51 per cent of Poland's former biggest truck
producer, which assembled only 820 vehicles at a loss of 135bn zlotys
(Dollars 6m) last year, was accepted by the government after two years of
desultory talks with Volvo's truck division.
SZC agreed to invest 1,000bn zlotys in modernising the plant over the next
six years, with funding from bank loans guaranteed by Daimler-Benz.
SZC said: 'We want to put together a holding company controlling plants
which are able to produce parts and possibly assemble a Mercedes vehicle in
Poland when the German company is ready for such a decision.'
The SZC move follows a Polish government decision last week to ban imports
of used trucks aged over three years. This will make local producers such as
SZC more competitive.
Last year, SZC reported a 204bn zlotys net profit. It is planning a Warsaw
stock market flotation combined with a new share issue to fund further
investments in Poland's engineering sector.
The new issue will give Mercedes, which kept a low profile during the Jelcz
talks, a chance to take an equity stake in SZC.
SZC already assemble medical vehicles and delivery vans at Glowno, a former
vehicle refitting works near Lodz.

<TEXT>
Bechtel of the US and China International Trust and Investment Company
yesterday set up a joint venture to expedite the multi-billion dollar
development of port facilities and services at Daxie island south of
Shanghai.
Citic, China's largest investment conglomerate, last year secured the right
to develop the 31 sq km island as a gateway to China's central provinces. It
plans to spend about Dollars 500m on Daxie's basic infrastructure, with
expected investment from the private sector of Dollars 3bn-Dollars 6bn over
the next 15 years.
Daxie will offer 40 berths for container and petroleum cargo vessels in
excess of 200,000 tonnes. Annual capacity will be 5m containers and an
overall 100m tonnes of cargo.
Investment opportunities will include petroleum and chemical processing;
storage and trans-shipment facilities; industrial and high-technology
manufacturing; commercial and residential site development; and privatised
infrastructure.
The Bechtel-Citic joint venture - Xinde Joint Development Company - will
serve as a marketing, operating and services organisation for Daxie, which
is situated 140km south of Shanghai and lies 600 metres offshore.
A railway and highway will connect the island with the mainland and the
provinces of Jiangxi, Hunan, Guizhou and Yunnan, which have been
disadvantaged by poor transport links with the outside world.
International companies are reported to have shown a keen interest and are
expected to conclude agreements for 'first phase' projects by early next
year.
Mr Riley Bechtel, president of the Bechtel Group, said Bechtel was involved
in other large projects, including Jubail in Saudi Arabia. It was also a
consultant for the new Hong Kong airport at Chek Lap Kok.
Bechtel and Citic established a joint engineering consultancy in the early
1980s.

formal investigation.
The plaintiffs allege that five Chinese companies in the capital's
Zhongguancun computer district illegally copied, displayed and sold their

They plan to take the suit to the Court of International Trade and the

Hochtief, one of Germany's biggest construction companies, has won a DM640m
(Dollars 408m) contract to rebuild and extend the badly damaged Beirut
airport, writes Michael Lindemann in Bonn.
The Essen-based company said work was due to start in the autumn and would
probably continue until 1998. It will work with Consolidated Contractors
SAL, a Lebanese company, and will use a variety of sub-contractors mainly to
supply the workforce.
Years of fighting around the Lebanese capital have left the airport in
ruins, without proper runways and facilities. The Lebanese government had
earmarked the project as a priority in an attempt to attract foreign
investors.
The 3.4km runway is to be extended 1.9km into the sea and the contract also
includes the construction of a passenger terminal, a transit centre, a
control tower and a hotel. Hochtief has been involved in a variety of
construction projects in the Middle East including the airport in Jeddah,
which handles visitors on pilgrimage to Mecca.

Mr Hikmet Cetin, Turkish foreign minister, resigned yesterday after he had
learned from newspapers of plans to dismiss him. Mr Cetin submitted his
resignation to Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and Deputy Prime Minister Murat
Karayalcin, who is also the leader of the Social Democrat Populist party
(SHP), the junior partner in Turkey's coalition government. Mr Karayalcin
was expected to name Mr Mumtaz Soysal as foreign minister in a reshuffle of
all 11 SHP-held ministries. Mr Soysal believes Turkey should adopt a more
independent foreign policy from Nato on issues such as Cyprus and Iraq, and
opposes extending the mandate allowing western forces to patrol Kurdish-held
northern Iraq from Turkish bases. He has said Ankara should not complete a
planned customs union with the EU next year unless the union extends
substantial financial aid to Turkey, currently blocked by Greece, and
opposes Mrs Ciller's privatisation plans.

BCE, Canada's biggest telecommunications group, is showing signs of a
turnround, with improved performances from equipment subsidiary Northern
Telecom and Bell Canada, the fully-owned domestic telephone utility.
Second-quarter net profit was CDollars 223m (USDollars 161.7m), or 65 cents
a share, against a loss of CDollars 520m, or CDollars 1.77, a year earlier.
Total revenues were CDollars 5.3bn against CDollars 4.66bn, up 14 per cent.
The 1993 period included BCE's share of Northern Telecom's special
restructuring charges of CDollars 624m.
BCE's first-half net profit was CDollars 474m, or CDollars 1.38 a share,
against a loss of CDollars 299m or CDollars 1.13 a share. Revenues were
CDollars 10.3bn, up 10 per cent.
Bell Canada, the biggest contributor, recored second-quarter operating
revenues up slightly at CDollars 2bn. For the second half, the figure was
CDollars 4bn, also up slightly. Net profit was CDollars 186m against
CDollars 179m. Half-year net profit was CDollars 378m compared with CDollars
327m.
Bell Canada continues to face strong long-distance competition. The higher
earnings were due mainly to reduced amortisation and restructuring charges.

debut

<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Northrop Grumman, the product of a Dollars 2.2bn merger in April between two
of the best-known defence contractors in the US, yesterday reported net
income of Dollars 65m, or Dollars 1.33 a share, for the second quarter.
It is the Los Angeles-based group's first set of results since Northrop
defeated Martin Marrietta in a hotly-contested bid battle for Grumman. In
the same quarter a year ago, before the merger, Northrop earned Dollars 53m,
or Dollars 1.12 a share.
Although the group said that sales, which rose 28 per cent to Dollars
1.31bn, would have declined by 13 per cent without Grumman's contribution,
Northrop is sticking to its original estimate that the deal will be earnings
neutral until early next year. This is when they expect the merger's
positive benefits to start feeding through.
The cost of the deal has left Northrop with Dollars 2bn in debt, compared
with Dollars 425m a year ago and Dollars 160m before the merger.
The group expects to eliminate the debt by the end of the decade.
The group said its backlog of business was valued at Dollars 12bn at the end
of the quarter, compared with Dollars 7bn a year ago.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
3M, the diversified Minnesota manufacturer of adhesives, magnetic tapes and
medical products, reported record second-quarter sales and earnings, boosted
by sales growth in Europe and Asia.
The company's net income rose to Dollars 343m, or 81 cents a share, in the
quarter, up from Dollars 331m, or 76 cents, in the same year-ago period.
Operating income jumped to Dollars 570m, from Dollars 516m last year. Sales
for the quarter rose to Dollars 3.8bn, from 3.5bn a year ago.
Mr Giulio Agostini, 3M's chief financial officer, told analysts that US
sales volume rose about 7 per cent in the quarter, and that European
turnover had jumped 6 per cent, compared with a 2 per cent increase for all
of 1993.
Europe comprises more than half of 3M's international sales volume. Given
the improving sales, 'we believe this is a sign that Europe is on the path
to recovery', Mr Agostini said.
3M sales in the Asia-Pacific region were up 11 per cent over last year's
second quarter, while Asian sales, excluding Japan, rose 30 per cent.
Although cost-cutting has trimmed 3M's global workforce of 85,000 by about
5,000 over the last four years, Mr Agostini said the company had added
nearly 800 employees in Asia over the last 12 months, to sustain the rapid
sales growth there.
Mr Agostini said cost-reductions, stronger economies in Europe, Asia, and
the US, and accelerated sales growth in new products would allow faster
profits growth in the second half.

The US Food and Drug Administration advisory committee for over-the-counter
medicines yesterday failed to decide whether to recommend Tagamet -
SmithKline Beecham's top-selling product last year - for approval.
The Anglo-American healthcare group wants to be able to sell the anti-ulcer
drug, whose US patents expired in May, without a prescription in pharmacies.
The medicine would be used for heartburn
The committee is scheduled to meet again this morning to see if it can make
a recommendation. The main concerns expressed by committee members were the
drug's possible interactions with other medicines, in particular asthma
treatments and products for thinning the blood.
SmithKline Beecham presented altered labelling and revised data on Tagamet's
safety and efficacy. In September last year, the committee had asked for
additional data.

FT  28 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Reuters slides
</HEADLINE>

   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reuters Holdings fell sharply in afternoon trading as US investors took a
dim view of the news and electronic information group's half-year results.
The Pounds 245m profit was in line with analysts' forecasts but there was
some concern over the operating margin. The company said investment in new
acquisitions and new business investment programmes accounted for the slight
margin decline and added that sales growth had slowed in May and June.
It appeared that Mr Peter Job, the traditionally downbeat chief executive,
disappointed US analysts and after the company conference the shares traded
in the form of American Depositary Receipts fell sharply. They were down
more than 5 per cent by the close of London trading and prompted the UK
shares to fall 21 to 459p with very heavy turnover of 14m shares.
Pharmaceuticals stocks were affected by comment in one US newspaper
questioning their ability to maintain high dividend payments. The article
cited Marrion Merrell Dow and Glaxo, which fell 13 to 559p. Wellcome dropped
6 to 634p, although there was some support from a study which showed that
its anti-AIDS treatment AZT or Retrovr could cut transmission of HIV from
mothers to babies significantly.
SmithKline Beecham held steady with a gain of 1 1/2 to 419 1/2 p in
anticipation that the US Food and Drug administration would give approval
for over-the-counter selling of Tagamet, the company's anti-ulcer treatment.
Oil major BP, the leading Alaskan oil producer, held slipped a half penny to
411 1/2p despite reports that the Clinton administration was making
significant progress in drafting legislation to lift a 21-year-old ban on
exports of Alaskan North Slope crude oil.
Shell Transport was affected by reports that production at a Nigerian gas
lifting plant had been cut by a third following an explosion. The company,
which produces half of Nigeria's oil, denied an explosion had taken place
but the shares ended the day 6 lower at 726p.
Burmah Castrol slid 23 to 865p after agency broker James Capel moved its
recommendation to hold from buy because of higher oil prices and the shares'
recent strong performance. Capel has increased its forecast for the average
1994 oil price to Dollars 16.50 a barrel from Dollars 15.
Tobacco and insurance conglomerate BAT fell 8 to 435p as good news on the
tobacco side was countered by disappointing figures from the Eagle Star
insurance arm.
Motor dealer Lex Service tumbled 30 to 447p after reporting interim figures
below market expectations.
Engineering group IMI hardened a penny to 328p after NatWest Securities
upgraded 1995 profit expectations. Leaving its current year forecast at
Pounds 84m, it raised the following year's estimate by Pounds 6m to Pounds
107.5m.
Airports operator BAA, a strong performer in recent sessions, ran into
profit-taking leaving the shares trailing 14 to 980p. British Airways eased
3 to 426p after it said it may challenge yesterday's decision by the EC to
allow its rival Air France to receive FFr20bn in state aid.
Food and drink manufacturer Cadbury Schweppes climbed 9 to 435p as
marketmakers covered positions in what was described as a classic bear
squeeze.
A surge in auction sales helped Sotheby's rise 13 to 828p.
Reports of takeover activity in the hotels sector ruffled some feathers but
failed to make much impact on share prices. Forte, which is said to be
attempting to persuade shareholders in the Savoy Group to support its
ambitions for a combined luxury hotel group, moved ahead in early trading
before sliding back to close a halfpenny ahead at 231 1/2p. Savoy 'A' shares
finished 2 adrift at 968p.
600 Group rose 5 to 64p after an upbeat AGM message from the chairman. The
company said sales and orders were ahead of last year's comparable figure
and the company's new products were being well received in the market.

FT  28 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Waters wanted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Water stocks were a strong feature as investor confidence grew ahead of
today's important regulatory review by Ofwat. Sector specialists said that
the value to be placed on the 'K' factor - the amount the water companies
can increase their prices above inflation after 1995 - was expected to be
around 1.3. The variance above or below this will determine how the market
reacts - and whether the companies accept or reject the Ofwat
recommendation. Rejection would mean an MMC inquiry. Ofwat will also
recommend the capital expenditure for the next five years, with the market
forecasting a figure of Pounds 16bn.
All the leading shares made strong ground as rumours abounded over the
report, which landed on the companies' desks two days ago. Marketmakers were
watching closely the tactics of those houses with water company brokerages
amid reports of selected heavy buying. Northumbrian was in particular
demand, the shares surging 21 to 597p. Yorkshire was also wanted, adding 16
to 541p, Southern gained 20 to 555p and Anglian 11 to 525p.

FT  28 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Move on Wm Low awaited
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bid fever was mounting in the food retail sector yesterday with strong hints
that J Sainsbury, Britain's biggest supermarket group, would launch its
much-vaunted bid for Scottish retailer William Low shortly, perhaps this
morning. Low, which is already subject to a Pounds 154m agreed offer from
Tesco, saw its shares surge as the speculation grew, ending the session 12
ahead at 280p on turnover of 3.1m.
The market was divided over Sainsbury's potential tactics, some specialists
predicting a blockbusting 300p-a-share offer to knock Tesco out of the
frame. Others were suggesting a 'no-lose' scenario for Sainsbury, whereby
the group would make a spoiling bid above Tesco's 225p-a-share which would
either force Tesco into a counter bid at a higher price, or deliver Low's at
a reasonable one.
Sources close to Tesco said that the company would respond robustly to any
Sainsbury offer and that a bidding war appeared inevitable. 'Tesco do not
like losing,' said one well-placed source. The prize of William Low would
give the winner critical mass in Scotland, where both are under-represented.
Sainsbury shares traded erratically on the rumours, ending the day a penny
down at 410p. Tesco added 3 1/2 to 240p.

FT  28 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Interest rate nerves return to jolt
share prices - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Interest rate confidence was jolted in the London stock market yesterday as
City analysts took a closer look at the survey of industrial trends by the
Confederation of British Industry and then at the sharp rise in US durable
goods orders reported for last month. The FT-SE 3,100 mark was abandoned in
late afternoon, in both the stock market and derivatives sector.
Slight disappointment over demand at the Pounds 2bn government bond auction
checked attempts by shares to edge forward in early trading. The market
turned off heavily when the dollar, Wall Street and the US bond market fell
sharply towards the London close.
The FT-SE Index closed at the low of the day, with a loss of 34.9 points
bringing it to 3,082.3. Volume, helped by trading statements from a number
of leading UK companies, rallied from the subdued levels seen this week but
was still modest by comparison with trading sessions of the past few months.
At yesterday morning's meetings at the leading securities houses,
strategists focused on disclosure in the CBI report that business optimism
had fallen in July, while capacity utilisation rates - already above
long-term averages - had risen further. 'Inflation pressures in the
manufacturing sector have picked up over the quarter,' commented UBS.
Nervousness that interest rate pressures could be increasing led to concern
that the feared rise in domestic base rates might come sooner than markets
have bargained for. The pessimists pointed out that the Governor of the Bank
of England and the chancellor of the exchequer will meet today for policy
discussions.
However, shares held up steadily for a while as satisfactory trading results
from BAT Industries and BT bore out views that further rises in corporate
earnings and dividends will protect the stock market from interest rate
concerns, for some time at least.
Confidence was challenged, however, by early weakness in sterling against
the D-Mark, in the sterling trade-weighted index which fell to its lowest
level for 18 months, and later by weakness in the gilt-edged market and the
short sterling rate. But the Footsie 3,100 mark was held until developments
in the US sent British government bonds down sharply and upset investors
across the range of UK securities.
Selling hit the stock index sector, where the September contract on the
FT-SE Index saw its premium against cash wiped out. A rally from the initial
fall in the Dow Average, which cut its loss to 18 points in UK trading
hours, was no help to the London market.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, less closely linked to futures trading, lost only
8.2 to 3,632.9, but appeared to be vulnerable should further selling develop
in the market today.
Seaq volume of 599m shares compared with 551.7m on Tuesday, when retail
business was worth only Pounds 979.7m, one of the few times this year that
daily retail, or genuine customer, business has fallen below the Pounds 1bn
mark.
The London market was caught between two fires. Retail and consumer stocks,
closely tied to prospects for domestic interest rates, fell back, with Marks
and Spencer, Great Universal Stores and Sears all weaker; similar factors
upset bank stocks. But at the same time, US and dollar concerns hit the blue
chip internationals, bringing setbacks for Glaxo, Shell, RTZ and many
others.
Some investors fell back on the utility sectors as defensive areas in a
nervous stock market. While the bearish school of analysts, headed by Mr
Nick Knight of Nomura, returned to the market limelight, some others
suggested that the weakness in equities might have been overdone in view of
the generally favourable outlook for company profits.

FT  28 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Renewed worries on inflation and disappointment at the outcome of the UK
gilts auction sent stock index futures falling through 3,100, a recent
support level, writes Joel Kibazo.
The first trade in the September FT-SE 100 futures contract was struck at
3,121. It
moved ahead as a leading UK house executed a 'roll over' trade from
September into the December contract.
However, the contract's advance was cut short mid-morning by the market's
disappointment at the out come of the UK gilts auction. September drifted
lower there after for the next few hours, only steadying around the lunch
time period.
The release of US durable goods figures brought another bout of active
selling as dealers reflected on the possibility of an increase in interest
rates. With the retreat on Wall Street increasing the downward pressure,
September fell to the day's low of 3,082.
Having briefly dipped to a discount during the afternoon slide, the contract
finished at 3,087, at a 3 point premium to cash, with volume improving to
15,723 lots.
The expiry of the July stock options was the main feature in the traded
options sector. Total volume at the close was 30,948, with 11,863 dealt in
the FT-SE 100 option British Steel was the busiest stock option at 1,349
lots.

FT  28 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Interest rate fears depress
US stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks suffered a setback as strong economic data pushed bond prices down
and raised the likelihood of an early increase in interest rates, writes
Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 15.21 lower at 3,720.47, while the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 0.79 at 452.57. Volume on
the NYSE was a moderate 251m shares. In the secondary markets, the American
SE composite dipped 0.48 to 434.02, and the Nasdaq composite closed 3.53
lower at 712.13.
The Commerce Department triggered an early decline in share prices with its
announcement that orders of durable goods had jumped 1.3 per cent last
month. The reading was much stronger than analysts had expected and
reinforced the prevailing wisdom that the Federal Reserve was prepared to
tighten monetary policy for the fifth time since February.
Further evidence of a robust economy, in spite of the four previous rate
increases, sent a shiver through the bond market, where the price of the
inflation-sensitive 30-year government issue retreated by about 1/2 of a
point.
Stocks mostly followed the lead of the Treasury market, but the session was
complicated by the release of a fresh batch of corporate results. With a
tentative mood still prevailing, some good performances went unrewarded
while the share prices of under-achievers were often marked down sharply.
Among the Dow industrial components, Disney fell into the first category.
Its stock added Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 42 1/8 , a modest gain in view of
second-quarter earnings of 49 cents a share, about 3 cents above
expectations.
3M added Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 51 3/8 as investors shrugged off the
company's strong second-quarter performance.
Ford, which handily beat Wall Street's projections, fared even worse, as its
stock lost Dollars 1 to Dollars 30 1/4 amid fears that the car industry's
recovery had passed its peak.
Bethlehem Steel came under the heading of under-achiever. Its share price
dropped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 20 3/4 after the company posted a profit of
14 cents a share, about half of what analysts had forecast.
The uncertainty over interest rates took its toll on several other stocks
sensitive to broad economic trends. Alcoa lost Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 77
7/8 and International Paper was down Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 71.
In a development unrelated to earnings news, Signet Banking climbed Dollars
2, or 7 per cent,to Dollars 39 1/4 after revealing plans to spin off its
credit card operations.
The brightest star of the session was Biogen, the biotechnology concern
whose shares are traded on the Nasdaq. The stock was swept 52 per cent
higher to Dollars 44 3/4 , a gain of Dollars 15 1/4 on the day, with some
14m shares traded. The surge followed the company's announcement that
clinical tests of a drug to treat multiple sclerosis had produced promising
results.
Meanwhile, Chiron, a rival biotech concern, had a bad day, with its share
price slumping Dollars 5 1/8 to Dollars 52 5/8 . Wertheim Schroder
downgraded the issue, citing the potential for new competition for Chiron's
multiple sclerosis treatment.
Canada
Toronto stocks fell for the third consecutive day, in moderate trading. The
TSE-300 composite index lost 15.89 points, or 0.38 per cent, to 4,134.01,
with declines outpacing advances 428 to 272.
Volume of 57.30m shares was above Tuesday's 56.13m. Trading value was
CDollars 655.0m compared with CDollars 651.0m.
Lac Minerals rose CDollars  1/8 to CDollars 14 3/8 after reporting
second-quarter net profit against a year-earlier loss. Lac also disclosed in
filings with US securities regulators that it has held third-party talks
regarding various transactions to maximize shareholder value.
Imasco said its second-quarter net rose to CDollars 128m from CDollars 95m a
year earlier, despite about CDollars 24m in pre-tax charges this year.
Imasco's shares gained CDollars  3/4 to CDollars 34 3/4 .
Mexico
Equities rose 1.66 per cent in active trading driven up by investor buying
following a decline in key interest rates and several solid first-half
company results.
The bolsa had its fifth consecutive advance on the back of a 66-basis-point
fall in the rates for 28-day Cetes, or Treasury bills, to 17.00 per cent in
yesterday's auction.
The key IPC index closed up 39.82 points at 2,433.22. At the end of 1993,
the IPC stood at 2,602.63. Volume totaled a heavy 2.05bn new pesos, on
137.5m shares traded.

the generally improved sentiment.
The overall index added 51 to 5,659, the industrial index 10 to 6,457 and
the gold 62 or 3 per cent to 2,146.
Among the most actives Gencor ended 35 cents higher at R12.25 in heavy

assets from Royal Dutch/Shell.
Platinum strength boosted Rusplats by R7 to R107 and Impala added R4 to
R102.
Engen gained 15 cents to R35.25 following news that it would buy Gencor's

FT  28 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Weakness in the dollar takes
its toll
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Profit-taking was evident throughout much of the continent yesterday. The
announcement of a sharp increase in June durable goods orders in the US,
which added to pressure on the Fed to tighten policy, was a further
disincentive late in the day.
MILAN suffered another sharp downturn as news of the arrest warrant issued
for the brother of Mr Silvio Berlusconi further damaged the prime minister's
bruised image and added to the market's uncertainties.
The Comit index, which fell 2.3 per cent on Tuesday, gave up another 14.44
or 2 per cent to 695.03.
The falls were again broadly based. Among the telecommunications issues,
Stet fell L160 or 3 per cent to L5,136 and Sip lost L74 to L4,324.
Olivetti lost L113, or 4.6 per cent, to L2,337, Montedison gave up L30 to
L1,443 and Generali was L1,015, or 2.4 per cent, lower at L41,019.
Pirelli eased L35 to L2,715 after announcing that a recently completed
convertible bond issue was almost fully subscribed, bringing in fresh funds
of about L993bn.
Fiat fell L135 to L6,678 after the company reduced the number of workers it
planned to lay off this year, as a result of better-than-expected sales of
its Delta, Uno and Tipo models throughout the European market.
Imi fell L298, or 2.8 per cent, to L10,113 as the state controlled finance
group said that net profits at its main operating unit rose 2.3 per cent to
L207.1bn in the first half of 1994.
FRANKFURT was weaker in official hours as investors turned to sellers again
after the market's recent improvement. The Dax index slipped 11.52 at
2,140.44.
Turnover was DM7.3bn.
In the Ibis the index fell further to 2,135.93.
Corporate news came to the fore. Allianz dipped DM14 to DM2,467 on technical
trading in spite of reporting a rise in 1993 earnings.
Meanwhile, BMW was another stock to suffer at the hands of technical
traders, the shares losing DM4 to DM870 as it reported a 14 per cent gain in
first half group profit, which was at the top end of expectations.
There were some good points, however: Hochtief, for instance, rose DM10 to
DM955 after announcing a contract worth some Dollars 400m for building work
in the Lebanon.
ZURICH saw profit-taking by London based investors for much of the day, but
the pressure intensified as Wall Street opened lower and US bonds were
marked down. The SMI index gave up 59.5 or 2.3 per cent to 2,544.9, with the
weaker dollar hitting blue chips.
In the chemical and pharmaceutical sector, Roche certificates gave up SFr190
to SFr5,300 and Ciba was SFr25 lower at SFr733 in response to the currency
considerations.
Banks, awaiting next months first half figures, saw UBS lose SFr24 to
SFr1,180 and CS Holding was SFr14 lower at SFr559.
Nestle dropped SFr26 to SFr1,149 and Brown Boveri fell SFr17 to SFr1,210
francs.
Georg Fisher fell SFr65 to SFr1,470 after a local newspaper report said the
company's bearer share no longer looked attractive from a technical point of
view.
Ascom bucked the market's downward trend, climbing SFr20 to SFr1,700 on
speculative buying.
PARIS suffered a bout of profit-taking in the absence of major corporate
news. The CAC-40 index lost 21.15 or 1 per cent to 2,055.69 in low turnover
of some FFr3.3bn.
Euro Disney again featured, this time with an announcement that it had cut
its operating loss in the third quarter. Thge shares ended unchanged at
FFr10.
MADRID slipped lower after Wall Street's weak opening. The general index
gave up 0.97 to 311.18 in heavy volume of Pta44.7bn with a number of block
trades seen as reinforcing the market's stability.
Telefonica dropped Pta30 or 1.6 per cent to Pta1,870 with 12.7m shares
traded, most in one block trade.
OSLO was little changed overall, the All Share index adding 0.24 to 641.13,
although Christiana A free shares rose NKr0.65 or 5.1 per cent to NKr13.40
in reply to the bank's better than expected first half results.

In its recent change of asset allocation among the Asian markets, Nomura
Research has increased its weighting in Korea to 2 per cent. This is no
surprise. Other brokers have also gone for the country, notably Barings,
which also rates north-east Asia in preference to south-east Asia, based
mainly on liquidity grounds. However, Barings favours Latin America above
all, pointing to its strength in natural resources. Foreign &amp; Colonial is
another favourite of Korea, emphasising that over the past month or so
earnings estimates for Korean companies for 1994 have been significantly
increased. Companies haver benefited from rising exports and stronger
domestic sales, they add, while interest rates have fallen.

FT  28 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia): Nikkei dips 1% as Hong Kong

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Arbitrage unwinding and profit-taking by overseas investors depressed share
prices, and the Nikkei closed down 1 per cent after posting a small gain in
the morning session, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 index fell 208.14 to 20,137.23 after a high of 20,333.27 and
a low of 20,103.92.
Traders were discouraged that the index broke a June low of 20,168, a
support level.
The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 6.96 to 1,615.82 while the
Nikkei 300 lost declined 1.15 to 292.81.
Losers led gainers by 748 to 261, with 158 issues remaining unchanged.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index lost 0.47 to 1,302.57.
Volume totalled 280m shares against 251m. Foreign investors continued to
take profits but traders said the selling was in small lots, and the low
volume exaggerated the index's decline. Buying by public funds supported
share prices at lower levels.
High-technology blue chips continued to be sold as investors reduced their
exposure to high-export oriented sectors which are seeing their profit
margins squeezed by the yen's strength. Hitachi, the most active issue of
the day, fell Y16 to Y959 while Toshiba lost Y13 to Y722. Nissan Motor,
which declined earlier in the week on selling by overseas investors,
rebounded Y8 to Y753, but Honda Motor lost Y10 to Y1,680.
Brokers, which are expected to be hit by the recent slump in share prices
and stock market volumes, lost ground. Nomura Securities declined Y10 to
Y2,220 and Nikko Securities fell Y40 to Y1,210.
Tuesday's merger announcement between Toyo Sanso and Taiyo Sanso, two
industrial gas and oxygen makers, depressed Toyo, which ended with an
offered price of Y580, down Y80 from its previous close.
Chiyoda Shigyo, an industrial paper maker which will be absorbed by San-Mic
Trading, an unlisted paper company, also failed to trade, and ended at an
offered price of Y406, down by a maximum daily fall of Y100.
Speculative buying supported Misawa Resort, which gained Y150 to Y638.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 151.46 to 22,495.40 in volume of 27.5m
shares. Aoyama Trading, the men's suit retailer, fell Y250 to Y4,090 on
profit-taking.
Roundup
The Pacific Rim had an active day with markets moving in opposite
directions.
HONG KONG rose strongly on buying related to index futures and options and
the Hang Seng index jumped 207.82 or 2.3 per cent to 9,402.18 in turnover
that improved to HKDollars 4.36bn from HKDollars 2.46bn on Tuesday.
The positive government land sale results, which failed to inspire investors
on Tuesday, boosted the market as both institutional and local investors
became active buyers.
Brokers attributed a strong performance in the banking sector to the 38.3
per cent jump on interim income reported by HSBC Holdings' Marine Midland
subsidiary. HSBC put on HKDollars 2.00 to HKDollars 91.75 and Hang Seng Bank
rose HKDollars 1.00 to HKDollars 54.75.
The properties sector was the biggest gainer with the sub index rising about
3.4 per cent.
SHANGHAI's A share index plunged 5 per cent as investors cashed in shares
when it became clear that the rally of the previous two days was not
sustainable.
The index lost 19.30 to 370.13 in heavy turnover of Yn849m.
In Shenzhen, A shares were hit even harder with the index plummeting 6.3 or
5.8 per cent, to 100.87.
The Shanghai A index had gained about 7 per cent since Monday, recovering
much of the ground lost last week. But selling set in as soon as the market
opened yesterday.
TAIPEI was dragged back from Tuesday's four year high by waves of
profit-taking, and brokers forecast that the consolidation was likely to
continue in the near term. The weighted index lost 65.88 or 1 per cent to
6,66.34 in turnover that fell to TDollars 90.54bn.
Some buying was in selected industrials, with the most active issue, China
Petrochemical, up 50 cents to TDollars 37.4, but sentiment was cautious as
the market had been overbought in previous days, brokers said.
MANILA rose 2 per cent on the back of heavy foreign buying of blue chips and
selected second-liners which are expected to post good second quarter
profits.
The composite index soared 56.07 to 2,784.60 in volume that picked up to
989.93m shares.
KUALA LUMPUR was pulled 1.2 per cent higher for the fourth consecutive day
by institutional demand for blue chips, although late profit-taking
flattened out earlier gains for the broader market.
The composite index ended up 11.88 at 1,020.19.
Telekom Malaysia firmed 40 cents to MDollars 19.30 in response to its 24 per
cent jump in half-year net earning.
BANGKOK was higher in active trade fuelled by institutional buying of the
communications, finance and banking sectors. The SET index rallied 21.14 or
1.6 per cent, to 1,367.64, slightly off the day's high of 1,368.20. Turnover
was a heavy Bt10.76bn.
Krung Thai Bank gained Bt2 to Bt66 and Prime Finance put on Bt6 to Bt173.
SEOUL edged lower in quiet conditions with the news that the central bank
would require investment trust companies to repay their 850bn won of
outstanding loans by August 12 dampening sentiment towards the close,
brokers said.
The composite index closed 0.98 lower at 934.22.
SYDNEY took the release of low inflation data in its stride, closing
slightly firmer after lingering in a tight six-point trading range. The All
Ordinaries index finished 0.4 ahead at 2,041.7.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Lira touches new low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The political woes of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister,
yesterday drove the lira to a new low for the year, writes Philip Gawith.
News that an arrest warrant had been issued for Mr Berlusconi's brother
intensified speculation about whether the government would survive.
Political uncertainty prompted selling of Italian assets by foreigners, and
this drove the lira to a low of L1,007 against the D-Mark. It closed in
London off the low at L1,006 from L996.7 on Tuesday.
UK dealers reported that the Bank of Italy had intervened to support the
lira around L1,005.
Trading conditions in the foreign exchange markets remained thin. Analysts
said the market continued to be dominated by interbank day traders, with
medium and long term investors mostly absent.
Eurosterling contracts fell sharply as the mixed reception given yesterday's
gilts auction, the weak US Treasury market and fears about UK interest rates
rising, all preyed on sentiment.
The sterling index remained unchanged at 78.6, the lowest level since March
1993.
Analysts were pessimistic about the outlook for the lira, with most
predicting that it will retest the low of L1,010 against the D-Mark, reached
last December.
The catalyst for lira weakness was the story about Mr Berlusconi's brother.
This follows the recent controversy about a government decree which sought
to curb magistrates' powers of detention, and renewed criticism about the
unresolved conflict of interest between Mr Berlusconi's business interests
and the office of prime minister.
Although the origin of lira weakness may be politics, it has also focused
the market's attention on Italy's economic problems. Mr James Cornish,
European strategist at NatWest Markets, commented: 'The market is worried
that we are either plunged into early elections or, if Mr Berlusconi stays
on, that he won't be able to get decisions on the 1995 budget.'
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London said 'International
investors are taking the view that the shelf-life of Mr Berlusconi's
government is limited.'
In the past when the lira has fallen below L1,000, it has tended to attract
buying interest and recover. According to Mr MacKinnon, buying interest has
this time been absent. 'It now increasingly looks as if the lira is
comfortable above the L1,000 level.'
The Citibank analyst predicted that the risk premium that attached to
Italian assets meant there was a risk of a considerable further downside for
the lira. This view was endorsed by Mr Stephen Yorke, chief European analyst
at Chase Manhattan in London. He said that the market's fear was not so much
that the Berlusconi government would fall, but that it would stay in office
and 'drift', without getting public spending under control.
The poor sentiment in the gilt market contributed to some of the sharpest
price movements seen in short sterling for a number of weeks. The December
contract traded over 30,000 lots to settle 18 basis points lower at 93.67.
Mr Richard Phillips, analyst at brokers GNI, commented: 'The problem is that
everybody is long. There is no room left to buy the stock.' Selling pressure
was not aggressive, but buyers were absent.
A number of factors weighed on the market. These included: press reports
suggesting that UK interest rates would rise further this year, the low
coverage in the morning gilt auction, and the weakness in the US bond
market.
The dollar moved down to test the technical trend line of DM1.5740 - in
place since July 12 when the US currency started to recover from a low of
DM1.52 - but bounced off it to finish at DM1.576 from DM1.5865 on Tuesday.
Currency weakness was a spillover from the fall in US bond prices after the
release of the June durable goods figures. Orders rose by 1.3 per cent,
compared to market expectations of a 0.6 per cent increase, raising fears
that a monetary policy tightening might become necessary.
The June increase in durable goods orders, without transport, was the
thirteenth consecutive rise, the longest sequence on record.
Mr MacKinnon said he remained sceptical about the durability of the dollar's
recovery and expected the bear trend to resume. The US currency finished at
Y98.01 against the yen from Y98.
Any recovery is being impeded by fears that the Sunday deadline for progress
in US/Japan trade talks may be broken, raising the prospect of US sanctions.
The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 650m liquidity
after forecasting a similar shortage. Overnight money traded between 4 1/4
and 5 3/8 per cent.
In Germany, call money firmed to 5/5.10 per cent from 4.95/5.05 per cent
with money in short supply after a fairly tight liquidity injection at the
fixed rate repo tender. Traders said rates would probably rise towards the
Lombard rate of 6 per cent today as pension payments are made.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: India prepares for bumper tea
crop
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
India, the world's biggest producer of tea, which harvested a record tea
crop of 758.1m kg in 1993, is set for another bumper crop this year.
In the five months to May the country's production was up 12.8m kg to
194.6m. However, the gain in production was entirely on account of the
gardens in south India, where output of 83.6m kg was up 16.8m on the
corresponding period of last year. North Indian production fell by 4m kg to
111m.
'The quality of Indian tea has remained steady, except for what was produced
in north India in the month of April. The quality suffered in April as the
production rose to an all-time high of 60m kg,' said Mr HM Parekh, chairman
of J. Thomas, the world's biggest tea broking firm.
In spite of the early lead in production, industry officials think that the
Indian tea output in the current year will be around last year's level. They
say that the tea estates are 'not going to repeat the mistake' of producing
large quantities in November and December, as they did in 1993.
The extra production of 16m kg - much of it of inferior grades - in the last
two months of 1993 was largely responsible for the sharp fall in tea prices.
In the six months to June, the north Indian CTC (cut, tear and curl) leaf
tea fetched an average auction price of Rs44.04 a kilogram, compared with
Rs51.76 in the corresponding period of last year.
'This is a crisis year for the south Indian gardens, which in the first half
could realise for orthodox leaf only Rs33 a kg, against Rs48, and for CTC
leaf Rs29.13, against Rs44.55,' said Mr Parekh. 'At these prices the gardens
are not able to provide adequate funds for fertiliser and pesticide.'
In spite of Kenyan output falling 21m kg to 75.4m kg in the first five
months the world crop, aided by a strong Indonesian recovery and higher
output in India and Sri Lanka, was nearly 9m kg up on the same period last
year.
Tea has been fetching lower prices at all auction centres. 'However, south
Indian teas suffered the sharpest erosion in value,' said Mr Parekh.
Industry officials point out that, defying the general trend in prices at
the auctions, Darjeeling tea (orthodox leaf) fetched a higher average price
of Rs127.49 a kg in the first half of the current year, compared with
Rs116.63 in the same period of 1993.
Similarly, 'the really good liquoring CTC teas with coloury, full cups have
been able to hold their ground. These, however, constitute less than 20 per
cent of production in Assam,' said Mr Parekh.
The setback in prices of orthodox tea has much to do with the lower
enquiries from the former Soviet Union and Iran. As for CTC tea, for which
the principal market is within the country, consumers 'are ready to pay a
premium for quality. The medium and plainer CTCs are, however, meeting with
weak domestic enquiries,' said Mr Parekh.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: CIS copper heads for West
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
About 60,000 tonnes of copper has built up in stocks in the Commonwealth of
Independent States and is now available for export to the west, analysts
suggest.
However, they say the market should absorb the extra copper relatively
easily. Also, as western merchants have been competitively bidding for the
metal for some weeks, the present price is probably taking account of the
CIS stock overhang.
'Remember the western copper market was in deficit by 200,000 to 250,000
tonnes in the first half of this year. So we should not get too carried away
with the bearishness of this issue,' says Mr Peter Hollands of the
London-based Bloomsbury Minerals Economics consultancy organisation.
A late spring, transport difficulties, and bureaucratic delays in export
licensing all contributed to the CIS stock build-up. Mr Hollands suggests
that 10,000 to 25,000 tonnes from CIS stock will arrive in the west in
August and the monthly total will then settle at about 25,000 to 30,000
tonnes for the rest of 1994. This compares with 15,000 tonnes a month in the
first half.
Mr Hollands says that the impact on the copper price will depend on how
sales of the CIS metal are handled. 'I think that it will be done carefully
and will simply slow the rate at which prices rise, or cause them to
stabilise for some months. But if too much copper comes too quickly, it
could have a severe impact for a month or two.'
Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, points out that falls in London Metal
Exchange copper stocks have slowed markedly and 'if they start to rise again
(because of the CIS shipments) the hot money backing copper will start to
look for another home.'
He suggests: 'People are begining to recognise that copper's charmed days
are nearing their end.' The market will have to cope with a steady and
substantial rise in supply until the year 2,000. Demand would have to grow
by 5 per cent a year to balance the market whereas a 2.5 per cent growth was
more realistic. Mr Moore is forecasting that copper's price will average 95
cents a pound (Dollars 2,094 a tonne) this year and 92 cents (Dollars 2,028)
in 1995. That price would not not be low enough to deter planned increases
in capacity.
Selling by US funds drove copper for delivery in three months on the LME
down another Dollars 86 a tonne yesterday to Dollars 2,408.50 (Dollars 1.09
a pound) by the close.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ecuador on course for banana
sales record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND COLLIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   QUITO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
As Latin American banana producers are making renewed efforts to forge a
united front in the face of European Union import quotas, Ecuador, the
world's leading exporter, is heading for record sales this year.
The latest figures come only a week after the region's banana producers met
in San Jose, Costa Rica, to consider a possible cut in production to revive
depressed prices.
First half exports reached 1.6m tonnes, up 20 per cent from the same period
last year, and state officials expect this year's total to surpass the 1991
record of 2.6m tonnes.
Despite a drop in banana prices on the world markets because of oversupply,
total revenues are also running ahead of last year's, reaching USDollars
380m in the first half.
Ecuador's higher foreign sales, which supply 26 per cent of the world
market, are not due to increased production. The government has been
pursuing a policy aimed at cutting output. Since the beginning of the year
11,000 hectares of inefficient plantations have been destroyed, most of them
infected with the costly Black Sigatoka disease.
Leading banana exporters say that a further 20,000 to 25,000 hectares of
inefficient plantations need to be eliminated to boost the country's low
productivity level. Ecuador produces only half as many bananas a hectare as
its Central American competitors, but can compete because of lower overall
costs.
Industry analysts say that Ecuador's export bonanza results largely from
aggressive marketing. While other Latin American exporters have lost ground,
it has opened new markets in the Far East, eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union and has maintained its sales to the EC.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: High prices bring no joy in
Mexico - Ted Bardacke on problems faced by the fourth largest producer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TED BARDACKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico, the world's fourth largest coffee producer, is unlikely to benefit
from the recent price surge because of falling production and the
government's decision not to join the Latin America-wide export retention
programme instituted last year.
Instead, the small farmers who make up the bulk of the country's producers
are lamenting the price rise, saying the survival strategy they patched
together after the government abandoned the sector five years ago has
suddenly been undermined.
Meanwhile, coffee processors, now forced by declining production to consider
importing raw beans, have also seen balance sheets thrown into disarray by
the price mayhem. 'No one here is interested in these prices,' says Mr Luis
Hernandez, a consultant to the National Co-ordinating Committee of Coffee
Producers Organisations (CNOC). 'There will be no bonanza. For the moment,
it is going to make our lives more difficult.'
Growers will be unable to take immediate advantage of the high prices
because they sold their entire crop by the end of March, two months before
prices started their latest climb. Stored reserves have been completely
depleted during five straight years of declining production. Since 1989
Mexican coffee output has fallen by 35 per cent to 5.3m bags (60kg each)
this year. The price collapse that began after the International Coffee
Organisation abandoned price support efforts in 1989 means that growers
incomes have fallen by 65 per cent over the same period, according to the
CNOC.
The decline in production cannot be completely explained by the dramatic
fall in earnings. Compounding the problem was the government's 1989 decision
 -as part of its sweeping reduction in participation in the economy - to
abolish Imecafe, which served the triple role of credit provider, buyer and
wholesale marketer.
The same free market logic led agriculture officials to refuse to join the
retention programme set up last year, which is reaping big dividends for
those countries which did participate and so have extra coffee to sell at
today's dramatically improved prices.
The armed uprising in the southern state of Chiapas, the country's largest
coffee producing state, forced the government to offer a one-off handout of
USDollars 210 a hectare to coffee growers throughout the country. But that
is unlikely to stimulate much new production. 'I'm going to use this money
to buy corn for my family, not fertiliser for my orchard. I've got no other
choice, life is hard,' confessed Mr Neojito Morales, a grower in the central
state of San Luis Potosi, upon learning that a government check was coming
his way.
The abrupt disappearance of Imecafe also forced growers to explore new
marketing avenues for their harvests. A variety of new associations sprang
up that eliminated some of the middle-men who preyed on the industry. But
according to Mr Hernandez, these associations will have a tough job
surviving the price rise because more credit will be needed next year to
collect harvested coffee in volumes sufficiently large enough to be
commercially viable.
'Credit is scarce and expensive, so we are going to see a resurgence of the
middle-man, who of course will not offer the full market price, but will be
able to give growers more cash up front,' Mr Hernandez says.
In addition, some Mexican growers have been successful in selling their
crops in the organic and gourmet niche markets; but the price differential
between those niches and the standard coffee is rapidly being wiped out by
the general price increase.
Lack of reserves and the disappearance of traditional sourcing options is
forcing processors to consider importing raw coffee for the first time in
living memory, according to the National Association of Coffee Industry.
Association members are under tremendous pressure to compete with instant
coffee imports, volumes of which have increased dramatically since the North
American Free Trade Agreement came into effect.
Yet what seemed like a viable option a couple of months ago has suddenly
become very expensive. Passing the price increase on to consumers is a
possibility, but a dangerous one, given Mexico's weak level of coffee
consumption, less than 1kg a year per head, the lowest among the world's
major producing nations.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee frost damage put at 40%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coffee futures continued Tuesday's rally in London and New York yesterday
after Brazil issued a frost damage estimate that was higher than most
analysts were expecting.
The London Commodity Exchange September delivery position jumped Dollars 177
to open trading at Dollars 3,650 a tonne in response to the overnight
release of the Brazilian industry and commerce ministry's estimate of 15.7m
bags (60kg each) for the country's 1995-96 coffee crop. That was about 11m
bags down on the 26.5m bags tentatively forecast before frosts struck on
June 27 and July 11, driving the September position to an 8 1/2 -year high
of Dollars 4,085 a tonne.
Yesterday's opening surge was quickly trimmed back, but the price still
ended the day with a net Dollars 67 addition to Monday's Dollars 90 rise. At
New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, meanwhile, the December
future's price reached a peak of 220.5 cents a pound before easing to close
at 214 cents, up 2.85.
Tuesday night's announcement in Brasilia by trade policy secretary Mr
Frederico Robalinho had been anxiously awaited by traders who were beginning
to have second thoughts about the wisdom of the 81 per cent post-frost price
surge. Early ideas that the 1995-96 crop, which was in the flowering stage
when the frosts struck and therefore vulnerable to damage, might now turn
out below 15m bags had generally been abandoned. And as most analysts damage
forecasts settled into a 6m- to 9m-bag range the September price at the LCE
sagged to Dollars 3,662 a tonne at one stage on Monday. The market was
particularly vulnerable to selling as the record-breaking, Dollars 800-plus
opening jump on July 11 had left a yawning gap in the price charts within
which little technically-motivated support could be expected.
Mr Robalinho's statement, while not inspiring any great volume of buying,
relieved brokers fears that they might have to repeat the hectic scramble of
two weeks ago, but this time as sellers instead of buyers.
'We are looking at optimistically 16m bags,' the Reuters news agency quoted
the minister as saying, 'but I would say that based on technician reports it
would be 15m bags. . . The situation is really dramatic. We had a loss of
approximately 11m bags.'
Mr Robalinho made his estimate following a meeting of representatives from
the agriculture ministry, the economy ministry, agricultural experts from
nine states, climatologists and government coffee experts to weigh the
effects of the two frosts. 'These numbers are preliminary,' he said, 'but. .
. they will only change a little.'

FT  28 JUL 94 / Government Bonds: Gilts sharply lower after auction fails to
meet expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European government bonds ended a volatile session lower, with the UK and
Italian markets posting the sharpest losses. Weak US Treasuries following
stronger-than-expected durable-goods orders data put a further dampener on
European markets.
UK government bonds ended the day sharply lower following a disappointing
gilts auction and late selling in the futures pits.
The initial reaction to the auction results was muted, with dealers
disappointed that the Pounds 2bn of 6.25 per cent gilts due 2010 had a
bid-to-cover ratio of just 1.29 times.
'The gilt auction result was worse than expected,' said Mr Edmond Warner,
head of strategy at Kleinwort Benson. 'We needed a cover of around 2 times -
so many expectations had been built into this,' he added.
Yesterday's auction - the first for a conventional, long-dated gilt since
January - had been regarded as a key test of market sentiment, and the low
investor demand indicated that it remains fragile, traders said.
Some dealers reported investors switching into the new stock out of other
gilts but said there was little outright investor buying of the new bonds.
Seeing other European and US bonds falling, traders decided to hedge their
long positions by selling futures against them, causing a sharp fall in the
gilt futures price in late trading, he explains. The September long gilt
contract on Liffe fell by 1 27/32 to 101 3/32 on the day.
Prices were further pressured by rumours that Bank of England governor Eddie
George and Chancellor Kenneth Clarke may raise UK interest rates when they
meet today.
Italian markets took another tumble as rising political tensions weighed on
bonds and the currency.
Reports that an arrest warrant for Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's
brother had been issued in connection with the probe of his media company
Fininvest, and late rumours - denied by a government spokesman  - that Mr
Berlusconi would himself resign, sent bond yields soaring towards their
year's highs.
The Italian 10-year yield spread over bunds rose to 411 basis points, from
390 on Tuesday. The September BTP future on the Italian futures exchange
fell by 1.52 point to 101.31.
German bonds also weakened on the day, hit by weakness in the US market but
remaining largely range-bound.
The Treuhandanstalt's five-year note was absorbed without difficulty but saw
little retail demand, dealers said. This was reflected in the modest size of
the issue: the Bundesbank sold DM2.49bn of the 6.25 per cent paper to the
market and retained DM1.51bn for market-tending purposes.
US Treasury bonds retreat-ed yesterday amid fresh evidence of an
accelerating economy.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  1/2 lower at
84 5/16 , with the yield climbing to 7.589 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was down  3/32 at 99 13/16 , to yield 6.21 per cent.
The catalyst for the downturn was the Commerce Department's announcement of
a 1.3 per cent rise in orders for durable goods last month. The data was
much stronger than the consensus forecast of a 0.6 per cent gain.
Economists said the big jump demonstrated the continued strength of the
manufacturing sector despite this year's cycle of interest rate increases.
The news reinforced the expectation that the Federal Reserve was poised to
lift rates in the coming weeks. The robust data also raised the likelihood
of a move to put up the pivotal Federal Funds rate by 50 basis points to
4.75 per cent, rather than a more modest 25-point increase.
Looking ahead, the development escalated fears over Friday's preliminary
estimate of second-quarter economic growth. A strong reading could send
bonds into a tailspin.
The bearish fundamentals also had an impact on the market's technical
position, with the uncertainty over rates depressing demand for an afternoon
auction of Dollars 11bn in new five-year notes.
Before the sale, dealers had sought to push prices lower in an effort to
extract concessions when the Treasury awarded the issue. The yield came in
at 6.98 per cent, just a little under market expectations, even though bids
were thin.
Afterwards, the market showed little reaction, with the long end drifting
higher and shorter-dated securities holding steady with moderate losses on
the day.

alleged frauds

The Chicago Mercantile Exchange has disciplined a former employee of a
member firm for alleged fraudulent trading on its Globex after-hours trading
system. The case is believed to be the first involving US computerised
futures fraud.
A CME judicial committee found Mr Steven Tropper, a New York-based foreign
exchange trader, had defrauded LIT America, a CME member firm, of about
Dollars 11,000 between March and June of 1993.
The exchange barred Mr Tropper from Globex, and banned him from working for
any CME member or member firm for three years. He has paid Dollars 11,000 in
restitution to LIT America, and was fined an additional Dollars 14,000.
Mr Tropper agreed to the sanctions without admitting or denying the charges.

FT  28 JUL 94 / International Bonds: EIB eurobond offering takes centre
stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Investment Bank's expected Y50bn offering of three-year
eurobonds was the main focus of attention in the eurobond market yesterday.
Lead manager Mitsubishi Finance reported firm demand for the offering. The
issue passed mainly to Japanese institutions although there was also some
interest from European investors. The EIB said the proceeds of the offering
would refinance a yen-denominated bond it called recently.
However, other syndicate managers expressed disappointment at the pricing,
which they said was expensive. The bonds were issued with a coupon of 3.2
per cent to yield 3.134 per cent. Syndicate managers had been looking for a
yield which was 10 to 15 basis points higher.
They said given such aggressive pricing, much of the issue was likely to be
sold back to the lead manager over the the next few days. According to one
trader, once the bonds were freed to trade the spread widened from six basis
points below the yield on the Japanese government's No 102 three-year bond
to one basis point above the JGB. However, the lead manager said that the
spread was unchanged at the close.
The other deal of interest yesterday was a Dollars 265m offering of
seven-year amortising notes from MC Cuernavaca Trust, the Mexican
state-owned toll road which links Mexico City with Cuernavaca. The
securitised offering will be backed by receipts from the toll road.
The bonds, which will have an average life of 3.38 years, are due to priced
today at about 350 basis points over US Treasuries to produce a semi-annual
yield of 10 1/8 per cent.
Lead manager Lehman Brothers said the single-A rating on the offering, the
first of its kind from a Mexican toll road, resulted in a broad spread of
demand from both sides of the Atlantic.
Elsewhere, news that Standard &amp; Poor's had lowered Venezuela's eurobond
ratings to single-B plus from double-B minus had little impact on spreads on
Venezuelan bonds since they had already widened out substantially last week
in response to the deteriorating situation in the country. Indeed, some
bankers are not ruling out an early military coup, in view of the
government's recent limitations on civil liberties.
The outlook on the ratings is negative.
S&amp;P has raised its senior long-term debt rating of Aegon, the Dutch insurer,
to double-A from double-A minus and subordinated debt rating to double-A
minus from A plus. S&amp;P said the ratings reflect Aegon's strong market
position, favourable operating performance and conservative capitalisation.
The outlook on the rating is stable.

FT  28 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: Group plans clearing house

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A consortium of eight large North American banks and the world's largest
derivatives clearing house have applied for regulatory approval to launch a
clearing house for foreign exchange transactions.
If they succeed, the resulting Multinet International Bank would be the
world's first multilateral clearing organisation for over-the-counter
currency transactions.
Despite the sheer size of the foreign exchange markets, foreign currency
trades traditionally are cleared on a bank-to-bank basis.
Multinet, which has been operating since 1992 as a bilateral clearing
mechanism, will be owned by First National Bank of Chicago, Chase Manhattan
Bank and six leading Canadian banks, including the Bank of Montreal, the
Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank.
It will be operated by International Clearing Systems, a subsidiary of the
Options Clearing Corporation.
The system will initially clear spot and forward transactions in Canadian
and US dollars, but eventually will clear other leading currencies.
Its supporters claim the clearing house will reduce the counterparty credit
risks and costs of banks' foreign exchange dealings.
'We're building a safety net under today's Dollars 1,000bn daily currency
market,' said Mr Garrett Glass, senior vice-president at First National Bank
of Chicago.
Multinet's operation must be approved by the Federal Reserve Board and the
State of New York Banking Department.

FT  28 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: IFC approves investment in
Peruvian fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the
World Bank, has approved an equity investment in a new fund which will
enable international banks to exchange their holdings of Peruvian government
debt for shares in state-owned companies.
The IFC's investment will be for the cash equivalent of up to 12 per cent of
the total debt and cash commitments to the fund, which has a target size of
Dollars 250m of face value of Peruvian debt (around Dollars 110m at current
market value).
Debt is expected to make up around 70 per cent of the fund.
Over the past two years 20 Peruvian companies have been privatised, raising
around Dollars 2.5bn. By the end of its term in 1995, the government hopes
to have sold off 60 state-owned companies.

FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: Turnround staged by Solvay in
first half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Solvay, Belgium's largest chemicals group, yesterday reported first-half
consolidated profits of BFr2.91bn (Dollars 86.6m), compared with losses of
BFr5.7bn.
The results were flattered by exceptional sales of non-strategic businesses
worth BFr1bn. These included the wood protection and special tile adhesives
businesses. The loss last year included a BFr3bn or restructuring charge.
The group predicted profits would continue to improve as long as the
European economy continued to pick up.
Turnover rose 4.5 per cent to BFr127.5bn from BFr122bn in spite of plant
closures. Sales in Europe rose 2 per cent, while those in the US improved 8
per cent and sales in the Asia Pacific gained 74 per cent. But sales in
Brazil fell 20 per cent.
The company said all businesses, with the exception of peroxygens, increased
operating profits. The plastics business had returned from severe losses
last year to profit. It had benefited from higher volumes, as well as
prices.

FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: Exchange-traded currency
products 'face slowdown' - Derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'There is little potential for success of new exchange-traded currency
futures, options on futures, or direct options on currencies, particularly
on exchanges other than the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world's
dominant currency futures exchange.'
This is the conclusion of a recent study by Professor S. Craig Pirrong of
the University of Michigan School of Business Administration. The study,
'Prerequisites for success of currency derivatives', was commissioned and
distributed by the Catalyst Institute, a midwestern think-tank that is
backed by contributions from, among others, the CME.
Despite its Chicago-centric bias, Prof Pirrong's study usefully points out
that two decades of explosive growth of exchange-traded currency derivatives
has now slowed appreciably, and that the introduction of new currency
contracts on the world's futures and options exchanges frequently fail.
Meanwhile, volume in underlying cash markets (worldwide foreign exchange
turnover is estimated at Dollars 1,000bn daily) continues to grow, and the
use of off-exchange derivatives, like swaps and over-the-counter options by
Forex traders is flourishing.
A successful new exchange-listed contract, the study concludes, must have
acceptable liquidity levels and low transaction costs.
The best contracts, he says, are 'natural monopolies' that focus trading and
liquidity in one market.
The study is interesting because two exchanges are engaged in a
cross-Atlantic struggle for market share in the same currency options
products. Matif, France's futures exchange, launched US dollar/French franc
and US dollar/D-Mark options in May, and after two months of dealing, have
kept the contracts viable.
Its primary competition is the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, which prior to
the Matif's challenge, was the only exchange in the world that did a
flourishing business in options on foreign currencies. Much of the PHLX's
business comes from France and other parts of Europe, making the exchange
much better known abroad than it is at home.
The CME trades options on currency futures rather the currencies themselves,
and unlike the PHLX, its currency options and futures volumes have been
eroding this year.
To remain competitive the PHLX keeps its markets open late into the night
and early in the morning to serve customers in the European time zone. The
PHLX established its currency options business long before the Matif became
a strong financial centre, and managed to defend its market share against a
challenge from London's Liffe in the 1980s. Liffe has since delisted its
currency options contracts.
In launching their own challenge, Matif officials reasoned it was time to
bring some of the currency dealings done by French banks in Philadelphia
back to Paris. So far, they have attracted a respectable amount of trading,
while doing little damage to the much larger PHLX market.
During June, the first full month of trading, Matif currency options traded
more than 70,000 contracts, with open interest, which reflects positions
held longer than one day, rising steadily to more than 23,000 contracts.
Activity in D-Mark options outpaced French franc turnover by about five to
one.
Volume continued to grow during July, with D-Mark options turnover at 78,000
contracts by the 14th trading day of the month, and franc options turnover
at 6,564. PHLX, in contrast, traded more than 1.6m options contracts in 10
different currencies and crosses during June. That included a 1m French
franc options that were mostly traded in the last week of the month. The
PHLX regularly trades more than 300,000 D-Mark options per month.
And if Matif business grew in July, the PHLX's flourished. On July 12, when
global foreign exchange markets hiccuped, the Philadelphia exchange had a
record single-day turnover of 278,764.
Mr Randy Kelsey, an assistant vice-president at Cargill Investors Services,
a brokerage house that is a member of both the Matif and PHLX says that the
new Matif options have done remarkably well given the stiff competition from
PHLX and the scepticism that greeted the Paris contracts.
'To date I don't see a loser in this. Its a big plus if the Matif can
sustain the business,' says Mr Kelsey.

Telekom Malaysia increased net profits 23.7 per cent to MDollars 605.8m
(USDollars 233.6m) for the six months to June 30 compared with the previous
six months. Earnings per share were 30.5 cents.
The market greeted the results, which were within expectations, with
enthusiasm. Mr James Hay, of Arab-Malaysian Securities, said: 'It's such a
relief that they have come in well.' Most forecasts for the full year range
from 71 cents to 75 cents.
Turnover rose 15.3 per cent to MDollars 2.13bn, while pre-tax profits were
up 12.1 per cent to MDollars 788.8m. Net profits were helped by a fall in
tax rates from 30.3 per cent in the first half of 1993 to 23.3 per cent in
the first half of 1994.
Over the past year, Telekom's installed line capacity has grown from 12
customers per 100 population to 14 per 100. Analysts expect penetration to
reach 15 per hundred by the year-end.
Analysts see Telekom as a stronger utility in the market than Tenaga, the
national power company.

<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Noranda, the Canadian resources group, has reported sharply higher
second-quarter earnings, thanks to rising commodity prices, favourable
currency movements and a reduced stake in Falconbridge, the nickel producer.
Net earnings jumped to CDollars 81m (USDollars 59m), or 35 cents a share,
from CDollars 1m, equal to a loss of 7 cents per common share, a year
earlier. Revenues climbed to CDollars 1.57bn from CDollars 1.3bn.
The latest figures include CDollars 21m in net gains from asset sales,
notably as a result of a reduction in Noranda's stake in Falconbridge from
50 per cent to 47.5 per cent.
Falconbridge recently completed a public share offering, and Noranda began
fully consolidating the nickel producer's results from June 30.
Mr David Kerr, chief executive, predicted a further improvement in the
second half based on continued buoyancy in demand and prices for most of
Noranda's products.
Mining and metals contributed second-quarter earnings of CDollars 51m, up
from CDollars 22m a year earlier. The increase was due to higher nickel,
copper and gold output, and rising precious metal, potash and aluminium
prices.
Noranda Forest's earnings climbed to CDollars 23m from CDollars 8m,
reflecting buoyant lumber, panelboard and pulp markets. Oil and gas earnings
rose to CDollars 18m from CDollars 4m. More than half the increase came from
the sale of assets. Higher natural gas prices and oil production were partly
offset by lower oil prices.

<TEXT>
Mr William Donaldson is to step down as chairman of the New York Stock
Exchange when his first term ends next May. His decision, which was
expected, revived speculation over the identity of his successor.
The most likely candidate to take over is its current president and chief
operating officer, Mr Richard Grasso.
During his 27 years at the NYSE, the 48-year-old Mr Grasso has built up a
wealth of knowledge of the exchange's inner workings. He is also popular
with the exchange's floor traders and specialists, and industry sources say
it is unlikely the NYSE's board will choose an outsider.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GM Hughes Electronics and Allied-Signal, two US high-technology groups,
posted higher second-quarter earnings yesterday as growing automotive and
commercial aerospace revenues offset a decline in sales of defence-related
products.
GMHE, a subsidiary of General Motors, reported a 15 per cent gain in
second-quarter profits to Dollars 267.3m, or Dollars 67 cents a share, on
revenues of Dollars 3.5bn, up from Dollars 3.3bn a year earlier. First-half
profits totalled Dollars 579.8m, against Dollars 421.3m in 1993.
It said productivity improvements and continued growth in its non-defence
businesses were behind the gains.
Revenues from GMHE's automotive electronics division rose 24.3 per cent to
Dollars 1.43bn thanks to increased production of GM vehicles, which GMHE
supplies with electronic products, and stronger international and non-GM
sales.
The company's telecommunications and space operations saw revenues climb
24.6 per cent to Dollars 548.9m, mainly due to work on government-related
satellite manufacturing programmes and a contract to supply communications
equipment to BellSouth Cellular.
GMHE's defence electronics division reported a 10.5 per cent decline in
revenues to Dollars 1.38bn, while its commercial technologies unit also saw
revenues fall, from Dollars 168m a year ago to Dollars 163.1m.
Allied-Signal reported second-quarter profits of Dollars 196m, or 69 cents a
share, up from Dollars 167m, or 59 cents, a year ago and a record for the
New Jersey-based company. The strong second quarter took first-half earnings
to a record Dollars 365m, up from Dollars 313m in 1993.
During the quarter, its sales rose 4 per cent to Dollars 3.2bn. The
company's engineered materials division led the way, reporting sales of
Dollars 88m, up from Dollars 73m a year ago. The performance of its
automotive division was also impressive. It reported a 32 per cent increase
in net income to Dollars 62m on record sales of Dollars 1.25bn.
Allied-Signal's aerospace division posted higher net income, with profits
from the unit rising 17 per cent to Dollars 61m as productivity gains helped
offset lower military spending, which kept sales flat.

Imasco, the diversified Canadian group controlled by the UK's BAT
Industries, boosted second-quarter earnings by 35 per cent to CDollars 128m
(USDollars 93.4m), or CDollars 1.05 a share, from CDollars 95m, or 74 cents,
a year earlier. Net revenues rose by 4 per cent to CDollars 2.1bn.
Strong results from its tobacco and financial services businesses accounted
for the gains. Imperial Tobacco lifted operating profit to CDollars 148m, up
49 per cent, while Canada Trust, the country's biggest trust company,
contributed CDollars 88m, a jump of 83 per cent.
Hardee's, the US fast food unit, improved 13 per cent to CDollars 47m while
drugstore retailing was unchanged at CDollars 22m. The property unit
improved significantly but general retailing losses were heavier.
First-half net profit was CDollars 203m, or CDollars 1.65 a share, up 26 per
cent from CDollars 161m, or CDollars 1.24. Net revenues rose 1 per cent to
CDollars 3.9bn.
Imperial Tobacco's share of the domestic cigarette market reached 64.5 per
cent at June 30. But profit growth will be slower in the second half.
Rio Algom's first-half net profit was CDollars 24m, or 48 cents a share, up
from CDollars 11.1m, or 23 cents, a year earlier on revenues of CDollars
536m, against CDollars 474m. Second-quarter profit equalled 33 cents a
share, compared with 8 cents. The Cerro Colarado copper mine in Chile began
to contribute.

MacMillan Bloedel, the Canadian forest products group, lifted profits in the
second quarter. The group said a strengthening market for paper and wood
products would enable it to absorb higher stumpage and royalty costs in the
second half.
Second-quarter profit was CDollars 48.3m (USDollars 35m), or 37 cents a

CDollars 1bn, against CDollars 899m.
First-half net profit was CDollars 62.2m, or 47 cents, compared with
CDollars 68.8m, or 57 cents, on sales of CDollars 1.9bn, against CDollars
1.7bn.
Canada's two biggest publishing groups continue to recover from the
recession. Southam's second-quarter net profit was CDollars 11m, or 14
cents, up from CDollars 3.2m, or 4 cents, on revenues of CDollars 292m,
against CDollars 288m. Half-year profit was CDollars 13.2m, or 17 cents,
against a loss of CDollars 4m, or 6 cents, on revenues which edged ahead to
CDollars 565m from CDollars 561m.
Torstar's first-half profit was CDollars 21.9m, or 55 cents a share, against
CDollars 8.1m, or 20 cents, on sales of CDollars 489m against CDollars 459m.
Stelco, one of Canada's two biggest steelmakers, posted second-quarter
profits of CDollars 26m, or 21 cents, against a loss of CDollars 13m, or 21
cents, on sales of CDollars 730m, up 15 per cent. First-half profit was
CDollars 13m, or 6 cents, against a loss of CDollars 51m, or 72 cents, on
sales of CDollars 1.4bn, up 16 per cent.

FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: Marion Merrell Dow hit by
falling sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marion Merrell Dow, the US drugs group majority-owned by Dow Chemical,
suffered a 23 per cent decline in earnings per share during the second
quarter. It blamed falling sales of a number of its biggest products.
Lost sales from prescription drugs were replaced by sales of lower-margin
products at Rugby Group, a generics drug manufacturer acquired during the
last year, which contributed sales of Dollars 83m in the latest period.
After-tax profits for the quarter were Dollars 116m, or 43 cents a share,
down 23 per cent from a year ago (before a one-off charge taken in the 1993
period). For the half year, net income was Dollars 204m, 12 per cent lower
than the year before.
The company's performance stands in marked contrast to other US drugs
groups, most of which beat market expectations during the second three
months of the year, on solid sales growth in their home market.
Their figures suggest pessimism over the effect of managed care on drug
pricing may have been overdone, at least in the short term.
Leaving aside the effect of acquisitions, sales at Marion Merrell Dow in the
three months were 15 per cent lower than the Dollars 750m of a year ago.
Including acquisitions, though, sales rose to Dollars 764m.

FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: Animated films edge Disney ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The continued runaway success of Walt Disney's new and classic animated
films helped the US entertainment group shrug off lower theme park
attendances to post a slight improvement in third-quarter profits, to
Dollars 267.5m, or 49 cents a share.
In the same period a year ago, the group earned Dollars 259.1m, or 48 cents.
The results, which came in above Wall Street analysts' forecasts, were
welcome news for the company, whose fortunes have suffered recently from the
death in April of Mr Frank Wells, president, and the sudden incapacitation
of Mr Michael Eisner, the chairman, who underwent quadruple heart bypass
surgery 10 days ago.
These events raised a question over the depth of management at Disney, and
revealed differences within the group over who should succeed Mr Eisner when
he retires.
Yesterday's announcement of third-quarter results, however, helped reassure
shareholders that in spite of Disney's travails, its earnings continue to
grow.
Revenues in the period climbed 22 per cent to Dollars 2.35bn, thanks to
record revenues from the film and consumer products divisions, both of which
were buoyed by the success of Disney's animated films.
Film revenues jumped 53 per cent to Dollars 1bn, powered by the box-office
hit The Lion King, an animation feature which was released in June and sold
Dollars 186m in tickets during its first six weeks. Heavy demand in the US
home video market for The Return of Jafar, a sequel to the top-selling
Aladdin animated film, also contributed greatly to revenue growth.
The popularity of Disney's new animated films, and classics such as Jungle
Book and Bambi, helped boost earnings at the group's consumer products
division, where revenues rose 38 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 407.6m.
Sales of The Lion King merchandise and records were especially strong.
The one disappointment in the quarter was the performance of Disney's theme
parks and resorts division, which reported a 4 per cent decline in revenues
to Dollars 942.2m.
The group blamed the decline in park attendance on a fall in the number of
foreign tourists, and on the continued impact on its California attractions
of January's Los Angeles earthquake.
The other negative influence on Disney's quarterly earnings was
EuroDisneyLand, the struggling French theme park 49 per cent-owned by the US
group. Disney said it took a charge of Dollars 52.8m in the third quarter to
cover the cost of its contribution to an emergency financial restructuring
of the Euro Disney group.
Disney's shares closed down Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 42 1/8 on the New York
Stock Exchange yesterday.

Shares in Bethlehem Steel, one of the best-performing big company stocks in
the US earlier this year, fell about 8 per cent to close at Dollars 20 3/4
yesterday, as the company's second-quarter results failed to match
expectations.
After-tax income of Dollars 26m, or 14 cents a share, marked the fourth
consecutive quarter in which the big steelmaker has been in profit, and
compared with a loss of Dollars 14m, or 27 cents a share, a year ago.
The year-on-year improvement stemmed from 'higher realised steel prices and
increased shipments,' the company said. Sales were 10 per cent higher than a
year before, at Dollars 1.23bn.
For the first six months of the year, net income was Dollars 39m, compared
with a loss of Dollars 54m a year before.

at Du Pont

<TEXT>
Volume growth drove a 53 per cent jump in earnings at Du Pont, the US
chemicals group, in the second quarter, comfortably ahead of market
forecasts.
The advance was achieved despite lower prices than a year ago. Mr Edgar
Woolard, chairman, said the company expected earnings to continue to
outperform 1993 for the rest of the year.
The quarterly sales of Dollars 10.2bn were 6 per cent up on a year before,
even though prices in most areas of business were 3 per cent or more lower.
All of Du Pont's business segments recorded improvements over a year before:
The chemicals segment saw net income of Dollars 101m, up 11 per cent on the
year, despite a 5 per cent fall in selling prices.
A 61 per cent improvement in earnings from the fibres business, to Dollars
177m, was due largely to the acquisition of ICI's nylon business, which
pushed up sales by 13 per cent. Without this, sales were up 3 per cent.
The polymers business reported a 71 per cent earnings advance, to Dollars
183m, due to the divestment of some businesses over the year. Excluding the
effect of these, sales were up 13 per cent year-on-year.
After a further Dollars 47m charge to settle claims relating to the
fungicide Benlate, earnings in the diversified businesses segment rose 72
per cent to Dollars 208m.
Underlying earnings in the petroleum operations rose only marginally, to
Dollars 210m. This still marked a better experience than most other big oil
groups during the period.
Net income for the quarter of Dollars 792m, or Dollars 1.16 a share,
compared with Dollars 516m, or 76 cents the year before. First-half net
income of Dollars 1.4bn was up from Dollars 1bn.

FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: Sales fall hits US drugs group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marion Merrell Dow, the US drugs group majority-owned by Dow Chemical,
suffered a 23 per cent decline in earnings per share during the second
quarter. It blamed falling sales for a number of its biggest products.
Lost sales from prescription drugs were replaced by sales of lower-margin
products at Rugby Group, a generics drug manufacturer acquired during the
last year, which contributed sales of Dollars 83m in the latest period.
After-tax profits for the quarter were Dollars 116m, or 43 cents a share,
down 23 per cent from a year ago (before a one-off charge taken in the 1993
period.) For the half year, net income was Dollars 204m, 12 per cent lower
than the year before.
The company's performance stands in marked contrast to other US drugs
groups, most of which beat market expectations during the second three
months of the year, on solid sales growth in their home market.
Their figures suggest the pessimism over the effect of managed care on drug
pricing may have been overdone, at least in the short term.
Leaving aside the effect of acquisitions, sales at Marion Merrell Dow in the
three months were 15 per cent lower than the Dollars 750m of a year ago.
Including acquisitions, though, sales rose to Dollars 764m.
The fall-off in prescription drug sales included a 24 per cent drop in sales
of Seldane, an anti-allergy product, to Dollars 201m; a 10 per cent drop in
the Cardizem family of cardiovascular pharmaceuticals, to Dollars 188m; and
a 16 per cent decline in revenues from Carafate, an ulcer drug, to Dollars
38m.
Seldane's patent expired in April, while Cardizem has been off patent for
some time.

Valeo, the French automobile components company, and Siemens, the German
electrical engineering group, yesterday announced they were studying a
merger of their automotive air-conditioning operations and small motors
activities.
Total annual sales of the combined activities would be about FFr6.6bn
(Dollars 1.2m). The venture would be one of the most significant moves in
the restructuring of the European automotive components sector, creating an
alliance between two of the industry's leaders.
They plan to create two separate companies - one in automotive heating and
air-conditioning systems which would have annual sales of about FFr4bn, the
other in electric motors, with annual sales of an estimated FFr2.6bn.
According to Valeo, the plan would allow the companies to take advantage of
their respective strengths in the two market segments.
Valeo, which would contribute about FFr3bn of the sales in the automotive
heating and air-conditioning business, would hold a majority share in this
company.
Siemens, by contrast, would hold a majority stake in the small motors
business and contribute about FFr2.4bn of the combined annual sales.
The motors would be used in automotive applications, such as
air-conditioning and windscreen wipers and in domestic appliances.
A spokesman for Valeo said the merged activities would complement each other
in geographical and technological terms. He added that the European market
for climate control and air-condition-ing had strong growth prospects.
About 15 per cent of European cars have air-conditioning systems, he said,
compared with about 90 per cent in North America.
The companies hope to conclude the merger study by the end of the year.
Legal details would then be negotiated.

Martin Marietta and Loral, two US defence companies, reported markedly
different results for the three months to June, a period in which both were
buoyed by con-tributions from recent acquisitions.
Martin Marietta failed to meet market expectations with a 31 per cent
advance in net income, to Dollars 162m.
Earnings per share of Dollars 1.29, fully diluted, were ahead of last year's
99 cents but well short of some market expectations.
Meanwhile, Loral's earnings of 65 cents a share were ahead of last year's 48
cents and above what the market had been looking for.
Martin Marietta's figures in the second quarter were the first to include
contributions from the space systems division of General Dynamics, acquired
in May. Despite this, sales fell 5 per cent to Dollars 2.5bn.
Loral, meanwhile, reported net income of Dollars 55m on sales of Dollars
1.3bn, compared with Dollars 40m on sales of Dollars 850m a year ago.

Higher metals and phosphate fertiliser prices helped Freeport-McMoRan, the
New Orleans-based natural resources group, report second-quarter net income
of Dollars 4.63m, or 3 cents a share, compared with a net loss of Dollars
77.4m, or 54 cents, a year ago.
For the six months to June 30, the company recorded net income of Dollars
17m, or 12 cents, against a net loss of Dollars 132.7m, or 93 cents.
Second-quarter revenues benefited from increased sales volumes. Freeport's
metals affiliate, Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold, sold 168.6m lbs of copper
and 185,400 troy ounces of gold, up from 140m lbs and 127,200 ounces in the
same quarter of 1993.
A price-protection hedging programme also lifted the average realised price
of copper to Dollars 1.02 a lb, against 90 cents, while gold sale prices
averaged Dollars 353.82 an ounce, compared with Dollars 338.60.
However, copper production costs were abnormally high in the quarter.

Shares in Bethlehem Steel, one of the best-performing big company stocks in
the US earlier this year, fell about 8 per cent to Dollars 20 3/4 by midday
yesterday, as the company's second-quarter results failed to match
expectations.
After-tax income of Dollars 26m, or 14 cents a share, marked the fourth
consecutive quarter in which the big steelmaker has been in profit, and
compared with a loss of Dollars 14m, or 27 cents a share, a year ago.
However, most analysts had predicted that stronger demand for steel from
automotive manufacturers and the construction industry, together with a
series of price increases in the past year, would push earnings per share in
the quarter up to around 30 cents.
The year-on-year improvement stemmed from 'higher realised steel prices and
increased shipments,' the company said. Sales were 10 per cent higher than a
year before, at Dollars 1.23bn.
However, profit growth was held back by higher operating costs. The company
blamed this in part on the need to buy in supplies of steel to feed its
mills, and of coke to keep its furnaces running. The latter was needed
because the coke oven in its Burns Harbour plant is being rebuilt.
The company has also faced higher capital spending, which rose by more than
three-quarters to Dollars 223m in the first half of the year and is
projected to reach Dollars 450m for the year as a whole, up from Dollars
327m in 1993.
Mr Curtis Barnette, chairman and chief executive, forecast continuing strong
demand for steel 'through 1995'.
For the first six months of the year, net income was Dollars 39m, compared
with a loss of Dollars 54m a year before.

Surging beer sales helped Anheuser-Busch, the largest US brewer, achieve
record sales and earnings in the second quarter and first half of the year.
The St Louis-based group yesterday said beer sales to wholesalers jumped 3.3
per cent, to 23.4m barrels, in second three months of 1994. By the end of
June, the Budweiser family of beers commanded 43.7 per cent of the brewing
industry's total US sales, up 1.2 percentage points from last year's level.
The volume gains translated into a 6 per cent increase in second-quarter
revenues, to Dollars 3.6bn, against Dollars 3.42bn in the corresponding
period of 1993.
Operating income jumped 7.5 per cent to Dollars 576.6m, primarily as a
result of the performance of the US brewing business. Profits at Campbell
Taggart, the company's baking division, declined as higher commodity prices
put pressure on margins.
Net income reached an all-time high of Dollars 322.5m, 4.5 per cent higher
than the year-earlier figure of Dollars 308.6m. Earnings per share, on a
fully-diluted basis, were Dollars 1.20, against Dollars 1.11 last time .
For the first six months of the year, Anheuser Busch posted net income of
Dollars 527m, or Dollars 1.96 a share, on revenues of Dollars 6.62bn. The
results compare with earnings of Dollars 502.7m, or Dollars 1.80, on Dollars
6.3bn in sales in the 1993 half.

<TEXT>
Credit Lyonnais, the troubled state-owned bank, yesterday announced the sale
of a 16 per cent stake in its subsidiary Union des Assurances Federales.
This brings total assets sold off since March by the bank's new management
to FFr5.6bn (Dollars 1bn).
Credit Lyonnais said its private placement of the stake with French and
foreign investors would bring in FFr1.16bn. This would realise a FFr650m
capital gain for the bank which is striving to rebuild its funds in the face
of record losses and bad debts. The bank's recent sale of its stake in FNAC,
the record and book chain, to the Pinault group gave it FFr4.5bn.
Credit Lyonnais now holds 51 per cent of UAF having sold a 33 per cent stake
in January for FFr2bn. It said yesterday it intended to keep UAF as its main
life insurance operation and future vehicle for managing private pension
funds, if and when these were introduced in France.
By contrast, Credit Lyonnais said it was still looking for a partner in
non-life insurance whose products could be marketed in its banking network.
Allianz of Germany confirmed yesterday it was discussing just such a
partnership with the French bank.
Credit Lyonnais had earlier approached Assurances Generales de France (AGF)
on such a deal, but the latter decided to turn instead to Societe Generale
as it banking partner. Societe Generale has said it wanted to increase its
stake in AGF to 6 per cent from 2 per cent, on the latter's privatisation.
Credit Lyonnais this week refused to comment on reports that it wanted to
sell its 3 per cent stake in Total, the oil company. The French Treasury is
reported to want AGF to buy these shares, under an agreement that
state-owned shareholders in Total would give each other first option on any
of their share sales. But AGF said it had received no request to buy the
Credit Lyonnais stake in Total.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, saw net profits rise to NKr2.7bn
(Dollars 380m) from NKr1.9bn in the first half, driven by higher net
financial revenues and a modest rise in operating profits.
Oil prices were lower than a year ago, averaging NKr110 per barrel, compared
with NKr126, and refinery margins were down sharply. But the group's North
Sea oil production reached a record 441,000 barrels a day  - up from 412,000
 -and gas volumes and prices were both higher.
Statoil said it needed to continue cutting costs to improve results further.
'Although oil prices have risen recently, uncertainty persists about future
price developments and the exchange rate for the US dollar,' it stated. It
expects to maintain high oil production levels during the second half.
Operating revenues climbed to NKr41.4bn from NKr40.2bn, with operating
profits NKr300m higher at NKr7bn. Operating profits within exploration and
production fell NKr1.1bn to NKr3.9bn, partially offset by a NKr670m increase
to NKr2.3bn in natural gas. Oil trading and shipping profits rose to NKr649m
from NKr308m.
Net financial revenues rose to NKr1.5bn from NKr26m, due mainly to
unrealised currency gains.

FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: Fall in underwriting losses
helps recovery at Allianz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Allianz, Europe's biggest insurance group, staged a stronger-than-expected
recovery last year, when pre-tax profits rose 25 per cent to DM2bn (Dollars
1.25bn).
Underwriting losses shrank to DM1.2bn from DM1.7bn, while a one-off tax
credit related to corporate taxation changes helped hoist net earnings to
DM1.46bn from DM860m in 1992, the group reported yesterday.
According to Mr Henning Schulte-Noelle, chairman, Allianz hoped to lower the
underwriting deficit below DM1bn this year, while premium income growth
would be less than 10 per cent after a 20 per cent rise to DM66bn in 1993.
The group's premium income was bolstered last year by the first-time
consolidation of Deutschen Krankenversicherung, health insurer.
The chairman appeared concerned at the continuing weakness of the dollar.
Every one pfenning fall in the value of the US currency from its fixing of
DM1.7263 on December 31, 1993 would reduce group sales by about DM100m, he
said.
While the group remained open to further acquisitions, Mr Schulte-Noelle
said it would consider only strategically sensible purchases. Negotiations
with France's Credit Lyonnais were related only to possible co-operation, he
added. There were no plans to take it over or acquire a stake.
Allianz wanted to strengthen its distribution in France, Italy, UK and
Austria through collaboration with banks.
The group had already informed the Austrian government that it wanted to
link up with the state-owned Creditanstalt Bankverein, although negotiations
were still at an early stage, Mr Schulte-Noelle said.
It might be interested in a minority stake, possibly with other partners, if
the government would surrender some of its holding.
Allianz last month extended its reach in Switzerland when it took a 30 per
cent stake in Berner Holding.
International business last year accounted for 47.5 per cent of sales
compared with 46.8 per cent in 1992, with the American markets contributing
almost half of all non-German business, the bank said.
Foreign premium income increased to DM31bn from DM26bn, while domestic sales
rose to DM34bn from DM29bn.

Worldwide deliveries of Volkswagen group cars and vans rose 7.8 per cent in
the first half of this year, writes Christopher Parkes.
The Seat and VW marques were most successful, recording increases of 23 per
cent and 9 per cent respectively, the company said yesterday.
However, in western Europe, where overall car sales rose about 7 per cent,
demand for the group's brands, which include Skoda and Audi, increased 2 per
cent.
German deliveries fell 3.9 per cent to 508,400 units, while sales elsewhere
in the region gained 7.5 per cent to 600,600 vehicles.
US sales more than doubled to 57,000, while the Japanese business gained
almost 50 per cent. VW group turnover and earnings figures are expected in
an interim report next month.

FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: Christiania Bank recovery grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp reduction in loan losses underpinned the continuing recovery of
Christiania Bank, Norway's second biggest bank, in the first half, enabling
it to notch up net profits of NKr780m (Dollars 110m) in spite of bond market
turbulence.
The result is more than double last year's NKr324m profit and reflects a
healthier Norwegian economy and the bank's loan loss recovery drive.
For the first time in many years, amounts written back on previous loan
losses exceeded new loan losses during the second quarter. This brought
first-half loan loss provisions down to NKr61m compared with NKr913m in the
same period in 1993.
The bank benefited from higher lending volumes and maintained net interest
income. But it has not escaped the international interest rate upheaval,
taking NKr220m in losses on its bond portfolio in the first half compared
with NKr265m in profits a year ago. A drive to reduce interest rate exposure
is bearing fruit.
Christiania was a casualty of Norway's banking sector crisis, suffering four
years of losses between 1989 and 1992 and a collapse into state ownership.
Following a NKr2bn international share issue last autumn, the state holds 69
per cent of the bank.
Christiania has been able to write back amounts on previous loan losses due
to gains from repossessed property sales, higher collateral values, and the
rise in shares acquired through debt-to-equity conversions. It still has
some loan book problems.

FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: BMW car orders outstrip
production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Orders for BMW cars outstripped production capacity in the first half of
this year, when net profits jumped 14 per cent to DM290m (Dollars 181m), the
automotive group said yesterday.
Output of BMW models, hampered by retooling for new models, rose 3 per cent
to 285,000 units, while deliveries to customers increased 5 per cent to
291,500. Turnover climbed 7.4 per cent to DM15.8bn.
The newly-acquired Rover group also worked at the limits of its capacity to
deliver 234,600 vehicles - a 16 per cent improvement on the first half of
1993, BMW said. No financial details for Rover were included in the report.
Although the company provided no clear forecasts for the full year, apart
from predicting higher deliveries and production, it suggested the early
pace would slow.
In the US, where first-half sales of BMWs rose 13 per cent to 41,700, it
expected overall demand for passenger cars to continue increasing but at a
lower rate than the 8 per cent recorded in the period to the end of June.
The company was concerned at the strength of the D-Mark, which 'could bring
into question the expected economic recovery', it said.
Lower growth rates were likely in western Europe, where price cuts, cheap
special models and government-funded measures to encourage people to buy new
cars, had lifted overall registrations 7 per cent to 6.5m units in the first
half.
BMW sales in the region rose 2 per cent to 201,200 cars. Registrations in
Germany increased only slightly to 116,000.
In Japan, the marque's sales rose 15 per cent to 14,700 units, in spite of a
clear fall in overall demand for quality cars. Although the Japanese market
had stopped declining, an increase in overall registrations was not to be
expected before 1995, BMW said.
In an enthusiastic review of the Rover purchase, the report said sales in
mainland European countries had 'almost without exception', grown by more
than 10 per cent. The introduction of the Land Rover Discovery to the US in
April had helped double sales of Land Rover vehicles there to 4,500.
The company's motor cycle business reported a 35 per cent rise in deliveries
during the review period to 29,300.
Production of two-wheelers, including assembly in Italy of the new F650
single-cylinder model, increased 11.5 per cent to 24,240.
The BMW marque's share of the world market rose to 5 per cent, compared with
3.5 per cent in the first half of 1993.

FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: Ford returns to the black in
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford's European automotive operations (excluding Jaguar) achieved a Dollars
310m turnround in the second quarter with a net profit of Dollars 244m
compared with a net loss of Dollars 66m in the same period a year ago.
The financial improvement in Europe, following three successive years of
losses, reflects the gradual recovery in the west European new car market as
well as far-reaching restructuring.
Jaguar, Ford's UK luxury car subsidiary, remained in the red in the second
quarter with an unchanged operating loss of Dollars 62m. However, Ford said
Jaguar was expected to return to profit in 1995, ending six successive years
of losses.
Ford's European automotive operations suffered total losses in 1991-93 of
Dollars 3.3bn, including Jaguar, and Dollars 1.5bn excluding Jaguar.
The return to profit in Europe follows two years of retrenchment in which
the Ford of Europe workforce (excluding Jaguar) has been cut by 15.4 per
cent to 83,000 people by the end of last year from 98,100 in November 1992.
Ford said the financial recovery reflected higher sales volumes with demand
picking up in most European markets from the depth of last year's recession,
as well as cost-cutting primarily in manufacturing and purchasing.
In the first half of the year Ford of Europe (excluding Jaguar) achieved a
net profit of Dollars 353m compared with a loss of Dollars 47m in the
corresponding period a year ago.
Jaguar's operating loss in the first six months was reduced to Dollars 102m,
compared with Dollars 118m.
Ford's European automotive operations including Jaguar (operating losses and
acquisition costs) improved to a net profit of Dollars 160m in the first six
months from a deficit of Dollars 257m in the same period last year.
In the second quarter, Ford of Europe has increased its market share and has
raised production in order to build up dealer stocks in the expectation of
strong demand in the third quarter.
Ford said there had been an underlying improvement in Jaguar's operating
results following progress in lowering costs and raising product quality.
Jaguar increased its worldwide retail sales by 14 per cent in the first half
of the year to 14,800, against 13,000 with increases of 25 per cent in the
US and 16 per cent in the UK partially offset by a 37 per cent decline in
Germany.
Ford has increased its share of the western European new car market in the
first six months to 11.7 per cent from 11.5 per cent a year ago helped by
strongly rising sales of the Mondeo, which have offset a loss of market
share by the Escort and Fiesta ranges. It has gained market share in the UK,
Germany and Spain but has lost ground in France and Italy.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Specialeyes, the USM-traded optical retailer, reported a reduced first half
deficit as sales were maintained despite a highly competitive market.
Pre-tax losses emerged at Pounds 187,000 in the 24 weeks to May 14, down
from Pounds 333,000 last time. Sales totalled Pounds 9.5m.
Mr Jim Power, chairman, attributed the improved gross margin to 'better
buying' while pressure on costs was maintained. Trading in the early weeks
of the second half, however, remained 'difficult and uncertain'.
Sales of contact lens solutions had come under pressure following the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission's decision to widen the availability of
such products. Mr Power said the group was attempting to counter the problem
by promoting a new scheme to build customer loyalty and repeat business.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Harmony Property cut pre-tax losses from Pounds 2.13m to Pounds 455,000 in
the 52 weeks to March 27.
Turnover rose 66 per cent from Pounds 5.69m to Pounds 9.47m, of which Pounds
5.18m was from acquisitions.
During the year, the USM-quoted property and hotel group bought a portfolio
of properties from British Land for Pounds 5.35m.
This was financed by the issue of 66m shares.
This, added to purchases made the previous year, gives the company a Pounds
7.5m asset base generating rental income of Pounds 750,000 a year.
In January, Harmony sold six public houses for Pounds 300,000 to Leisuretime
Inns, satisfied by the issue of 3m shares and resulting in an 15 per cent
stake in the unquoted pubs group.
Harmony plans to sell the remaining six freehold and one leasehold pubs.
'I think we can look back with satisfaction on the progress made during the
year,' said Mr John Main, chairman.
Since the year-end, Harmony, which has applied to join the main market, has
bought a portfolio of properties for about Pounds 7m from Mr Bruce Owen, who
became an executive director in May.
It has also a conditional agreement to buy a further portfolio from Mr Owen
for Pounds 2.45m, which will be financed though a mixture of cash and
shares.
Losses per share were 0.46p (5.87p).

Rubicon Group, which in a series of acquisitions and sales has been
transformed from a shop equipment business into a precision engineering
group, yesterday reported an 84 per cent advance in pre-tax profits for the
year to May 31.
The increase, from Pounds 1.22m to Pounds 2.25m, was achieved on turnover
almost trebled from Pounds 18.1m to Pounds 50m. Earnings per share came out
at 9.1p (7.5p) and a recommended final dividend of 2.8p makes a total for
the year of 4.6p (4p).
The improvement was principally the result of a strong contribution from
High Speed Production, a manufacturer of precision components and assemblies
for the electronics industry, acquired for Pounds 9m in July last year.
At the year end the shop equipment businesses were sold. These operations
had been suffering from weak demand, directors said, and had incurred an
operating loss of Pounds 160,000 (Pounds 1.17m profit) on turnover of Pounds
20.4m (Pounds 18.1m).
At the same time the company had acquired Beeley Wood, a manufacturer of
precision metal components and assemblies, for Pounds 4.8m.

FT  28 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Risk management problems increase Shield
losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Problems with its risk management business and a short-lived diversification
into computer hardware left Shield Group with increased pre-tax losses of
Pounds 1.24m for the year to end-March, against Pounds 425,000.
Mr Norman Mazure, chairman, said that conflicting market signals had
adversely affected the risk management business of Stickley Kent, its
auctioneer and property insolvency offshoot.
In addition, the personal computer market, which it entered in December last
year through the purchase of Kamco Computers, experienced considerable
commercial pressures. As a result 'margins were heavily reduced and sales
fell,' he said.
The hardware activity is to sold and full provisions have been made in the
accounts for the year.
A software operation, set up at the time of the Kamco purchase, also
incurred losses. Spending on this has been curbed and the future of the
business was under review.
On prospects, Mr Mazure said that the company had returned to property
dealing and development and these had realised small profits since the end
of the year.
Group turnover rose from Pounds 2.07m to Pounds 3.44m; operating losses
widened from Pounds 425,000 to Pounds 988,000.
There were Pounds 250,000 of provisions this time. Losses per share came out
much higher at 18.8p against 3.7p.

FT  28 JUL 94 / UK Company News: All-round growth lifts Menvier-Swain 23%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Growing recovery in the UK helped Menvier-Swain Group, the emergency
lighting and alarms manufacturer, increase pre-tax profits by 23 per cent
from Pounds 7.62m to Pounds 9.36m during the year to April 30. Sales rose 24
per cent to Pounds 70.3m.
The Oxfordshire-based group, which came to the USM in 1986, said it would
move to a full listing as soon as possible. The shares closed 13p higher at
237p.
Mr Roy McDowell, chairman, said: 'This has been a year of steady progress in
all areas in which the group operates. The improvement in the UK market has
continued with sales levels moving ahead strongly.'
Having made five acquisitions in the previous year, the group had
deliberately concentrated on the integration of previous purchases and
internal investment. The board and senior management had also been
strengthened.
Mr Roger Fletcher, chief executive, said capital expenditure of Pounds 6m
was unusually high, which would be reflected in future profits and sales.
The group spent more than Pounds 2m on a new lighting factory in France, to
be occupied next month, and Pounds 500,000 on production equipment for a new
emergency lighting product, Britelite, which would be sold throughout
Europe.
More than half of sales are overseas, and the strong performance in the UK
was partly offset by problems in continental Europe. A recent German
acquisition received faulty products from a third party and the French
lighting market continued to suffer from margin pressure. However,
businesses in the Netherlands and Denmark continued to improve.
Mr Fletcher said: 'Acquisitions are now on the cards again - particularly in
security and fire alarms.'
Mr McDowell will step down as non-executive chairman in September. He will
be replaced by Mr Tony McCann, chief executive of Bricom, the airport
servicing and parcel delivery company, who joined the board in January as a
non-executive director along with Mr Peter Pollock, former chief executive
of ML Holdings.
Mr McDowell said: 'The financial year has started well with sales and
profits in the first two months significantly ahead of last year. Improving
market conditions, management changes and investment in new products and
plant are all expected to contribute to another year of solid growth.'
Earnings per share increased by 14 per cent to 12.94p (11.37p). A
recommended final dividend of 2.9p makes a total of 4.2p (3.67p).

FT  28 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Verson plans US float to reduce borrowings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Verson International, the capital equipment manufacturer, plans to float its
US operations on Nasdaq in order to reduce its gearing of 440 per cent.
The company made the announcement as it disclosed its fourth successive
annual pre-tax loss and promised markedly higher sales in the year to
end-January 1996.
The deficit for the year to January 31 1994 was Pounds 8.19m, down from
Pounds 10.1m last time, on turnover ahead to Pounds 99.3m (Pounds 82.4m).
There was a Pounds 3.26m operating loss against a profit of Pounds 1.19m.
Losses per share were 5.5p (7.12p).
Borrowing, in spite of a formal debt reduction programme started in 1992,
has been constant for the last two years at about Pounds 54m. Shareholders'
funds at the end of the last financial year were Pounds 12.2m.
'We were enjoying the support of our bankers before we started talking to
them about this approach (the flotation),' said Mr Tim Kelleher, chairman.
'They didn't pressure us but they were pleased when we came forward with the
plan,' he added.
Verson expects to place 50 per cent of the enlarged equity of its US holding
company sometime in the next 12 to 24 months, depending on the state of the
market and its own order book.
Mr Philip Shepheard, an analyst at James Capel, Verson's broker, calculated
the value of the US operations at Dollars 90m (Pounds 58.8m). Looking at
likely future movements in shareholders' funds, he estimated that gearing
could come down to about 70 per cent after the flotation.
Financial difficulties hit Verson when demand dropped sharply after the Gulf
war in 1990. However, it said that, at Pounds 58.8m, the size of its order
book now is 95 per cent larger than this time last year, all group
subsidiaries would improve profitability this year and there should be a
marked increase in shipments during the 1995-96 year.
The shares responded with a rise of 2 1/2p to 20p.

FT  28 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Mitie ahead 40% despite 'fierce
environment'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REG VAUGHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mitie Group, the Greenock-based building maintenance company, lifted pre-tax
profits by 40 per cent from Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 3.36m in the year ended
March 31 on the back of a 39 per cent jump in turnover to Pounds 101.7m.
The shares closed 10p higher at 338p.
Mr David Telling, chairman, said that the outcome was achieved against a
background of a 'fiercely competitive environment'.
However, Mr Telling saw an improvement in the market place and so far,
results for the current year were ahead of last time.
Shareholders receive a 29 per cent expansion in dividends, via a recommended
final of 2.5p which raises the total from 3.5p to 4.5p, matching an increase
in earnings per share from 13.3p to 17.1p.
The dividend is covered 3.6 times by earnings.
A 2-for-1 subdivision of shares is also proposed.
Mr Telling said yesterday that indigenous sales growth represented some
Pounds 24m, or 30 per cent of the total.
He said he looked forward to an increase in margins fuelled by the bottom
pressure of a shortage of skilled labour which would lead to increased
prices.
Margins were 40 to 50 per cent below what they were 5 years ago, but despite
a substantial increase in turnover and acquisitions the company remained
ungeared.
The company also announced the acquisition, by its Mitie Engineering
Services subsidiary, of the shares not already owned in Mitie Engineering
Services (South East) for Pounds 1.69m.
Pre-tax profits of the offshoot were Pounds 599,151 during the 1993-94 year.
On completion of the deal Mitie will be able to consolidate an additional 45
per cent of the profits.

FT  28 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Standard Platforms turns in reduced loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Standard Platforms Holdings, the USM-quoted supplier of hardware and
software to the document image processing and archival storage market,
reported a reduced pre-tax loss of Pounds 35,640 for the six months to
end-March, against Pounds 382,695.
The outcome was struck on turnover down from Pounds 865,617 to Pounds
749,995, although last year's figure included Pounds 76,475 from
discontinued operations. Losses per share emerged at 0.9p (9.6p).
Standard suffered from the effects of its ill-starred expansion in the US
and was able to continue trading only with the support of its bankers.
It had hoped to sell to US hospitals and clinics an off-the-shelf version of
its optical document retrieval system. However, the expected sales never
materialised, losses mounted, and the subsidiary was sold.
Its shares were suspended last March at 36p pending publication of its
accounts. They resumed trading at 18p in May when the company announced a
Pounds 450,000 rights issue, loan stock conversion, a capital reduction, a
share option scheme and board changes.
The shares closed unchanged yesterday at 12p.

Intercare Group, the USM-quoted healthcare company, warned yesterday that
pre-tax profits for the second half of the year to October 31 were likely to
be marginally less than the Pounds 1.34m reported in first six months, in
turn down 20 per cent on the comparable period.
The company said that trading conditions in the Netherlands continued to be
difficult.
It added that start up ventures in the medical products division continued
to trade behind budget and were expected to incur development costs of about
Pounds 200,000 this year.
The shares fell 2p to 53p.

FT  28 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Castle Communications accepts Pounds 24.5m
offer from US group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Castle Communications, the USM-quoted record and video publisher, yesterday
announced an agreed Pounds 24.5m bid from Alliance Entertainment of the US
hours after the details appeared in a newspaper.
The 360p a share cash offer has been accepted by directors and other
investors accounting for 52.8 per cent of Castle's share capital.
To the embarrassment of both companies, an interview with Mr Joseph Bianco,
Alliance's chairman, giving the price of the offer appeared in the European
Wall Street Journal.
'We didn't know the Wall Street Journal was going to put it in the European
edition, which came out before we could make the formal announcement,' said
Mr Bianco.
Castle and its advisers discussed the problem with the Stock Exchange before
the market opened and requested that trading in the shares be suspended
until the full announcement was posted.
After consulting the Takeover Panel, the Stock Exchange decided against a
suspension and asked Alliance to put out a brief holding statement which did
not include the price. This appeared on the screens at 9.40am, at which
point the shares were still unchanged at 340p. They had risen to 355p by the
time the full announcement was made at 2.28pm.
Alliance, which is the largest independent distributor of recorded music in
the US, has been looking to buy music copyrights and was attracted by
Castle's catalogue of rights to 1960s and 1970s groups such as the Kinks.
'Castle also has a bunch of the best people in the business of exploiting
those copyrights,' said Mr Bianco.
Mr Terry Shand, Castle chairman, said: 'This is a unique opportunity for
Castle to further develop its international business, to continue to expand
its catalogue of rights and to take advantage of Alliance's considerable
distribution network.'
Castle shares jumped 58p to 335p two weeks ago when it announced it was in
talks that might lead to an offer. The company was floated at 200p in 1987.

FT  28 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Lex Service blames exceptionals for drop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lex Service, Britain's largest car distribution and leasing group, yesterday
announced a 64 per cent decline in interim pre-tax profits. The result was
distorted, however, by large exceptional gains items a year earlier and
failed to reflect higher vehicle sales.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 81.6m to Pounds 29.7m under FRS 3, although
trading profits in the six months to June 26 rose from Pounds 25.1m to
Pounds 28.2m on increased group turnover of Pounds 696.8m (Pounds 484m).
The company said the fall in pre-tax profits reflected a lower gain in the
latest half-year from the sale of shares in Arrow Electronics, which it
received in September 1991 as part payment for its North American electronic
components distribution businesses. Shares sold in January generated profits
of Pounds 7.7m, compared with Pounds 60.1m from sales a year earlier.
Operating profits, which exclude contributions from associated undertakings,
increased to Pounds 10.8m (Pounds 6.4m).
Although Sir Trevor Chinn, chairman and chief executive, said the underlying
performance was encouraging, the shares fell 30p to 447p after he warned
that retail demand had weakened in the second quarter and the group had lost
Pounds 800,000 on its Hyundai Car imports business.
'We should have done a bit better in the retail group and not lost money on
Hyundai,' he said. 'Our margins were hit by slowing demand and the drive by
manufacturers for increased volume.'
He blamed the second-quarter downturn on reticence among fleet purchasers
and private customers ahead of the August new car registration, which last
year accounted for 24.8 per cent of annual sales.
The deficit at Hyundai was caused by high marketing and promotion costs.
Nevertheless, trading profits in the group's core car and truck retailing
division rose from Pounds 8.3m to Pounds 12.1m; while profits on its
associated vehicle contract hire business increased 70 per cent to Pounds
12.1m (Pounds 7.1m).
Sir Trevor said the downward trend in trading margins on cars had been
partly offset by improved truck sales, while the fork lift truck and
servicing businesses were making 'good progress'.
Pre-exceptional earnings per share came out at 15.5p (12.5p), although they
fell from 74.8p to 20.8p under FRS 3.
An interim dividend of 5.6p (4.7p) is declared, but the group warned there
was unlikely to be a similar increase at the year end.
COMMENT
At the pre-tax level, Lex appears to have been involved in a serious
pile-up. But the distorting effect of exceptionals disguises generally
favourable market conditions. Demand may have slowed but the trend remains
firmly upward, and the group should benefit significantly from the August
car rush. However, Sir Trevor's caution persuaded analysts to leave
full-year pre-tax profit forecasts unchanged at about Pounds 55m. With
plenty of room for Lex to increase its sales volumes, the shares - on a
forward multiple of 11.7 - remain under-valued.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMC Industries, the soft drinks and video tapes group, is transforming
itself into a food manufacturer with the Pounds 11.5m acquisition of Red
Mill Snack Foods. Following the deal, which will involve a trebling of IMC's
share capital, it is proposing to change its name to Continental Foods.
With operations in Wednesbury, near Birmingham and Waspik in the
Netherlands, Red Mill makes a range of maize and potato-based snacks. In the
year to March 1994 it made an operating profit before non-recurring items of
Pounds 1.5m on turnover of Pounds 21m.
Portfolio Foods, Red Mill's parent, will receive Pounds 2.25m in cash and
462.5m new IMC shares, of which 372m have been placed with institutions and
other investors subject to a 10-for-7 open offer at 2p. Trading in the
shares has been suspended at 2 1/2 p.
IMC also announced its figures for the year to April which showed slightly
lower pre-tax profits of Pounds 364,000 (Pounds 377,000) on turnover of
Pounds 6.2m (Pounds 6.1m).

FT  28 JUL 94 / UK Company News: TI to get more from Snecma joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TI Group, the specialist engineer, yesterday said it would retain a greater
share of profits than previously anticipated from Messier-Dowty, its
newly-formed landing gear joint venture with Snecma, the French state-owned
aero-engine manufacturer.
Negotiators extracted improved terms from Snecma after revised profit
forecasts for the joint venture company suggested there would be a lower
than expected contribution from Messier's spare parts business.
Under the original deal the two companies agreed TI would receive an
additional Pounds 11m of any profits generated by Messier-Dowty in its first
three years.
The agreement was drawn up to reflect a Pounds 30m differential between the
value of Dowty Landing Gear, which TI acquired two years ago, and
Messier-Bugatti Landing Gear.
However, the lower contribution expected from Messier meant the differential
has widened since the deal was first announced last summer.
A completion agreement signed yesterday by the two sides showed that the
Pounds 11m limit on TI's additional share of the profits had been lifted,
and the group would instead receive 90 per cent of the joint venture's
profits in 1995, 80 per cent in 1996 and 62.5 per cent in 1997.
Thereafter, profits will be shared on a 50-50 basis.
'TI should receive a somewhat higher return from the joint venture during
the first three years than it would have received from Dowty Landing Gear as
a stand alone business,' said Mr Tony Edwards, chief executive of Dowty
Aerospace.

FT  28 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Signet pressed for EGM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A group of disaffected shareholders at Signet, the jewellery group known
formerly as Ratners, yesterday said they would press ahead with plans to
force the company into a capital reconstruction.
The Delta Dividend Group, based in San Francisco, said it was intending to
requisi-tion an extraordinary meeting to consider a wide-ranging overhaul of
the share capital.
Mr David Gale, president of the group, said the US investors - holding
variable term preference shares worth an estimated Dollars 29m (Pounds
18.7m) - would stop their action only if the company issued a statement
setting out proposals for restructuring and repaying dividend arrears.
Preference dividends have not been paid since early 1992, and arrears in the
12 months to January 29 this year stood at Pounds 58m (Pounds 30.3m).
Signet said it was preparing an imminent response to the issues raised by
the US shareholders.

FT  28 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Fairline boarded by South Africans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Newington family has relinquished majority control of Fairline Boats,
the Peterborough-based luxury powerboat maker which has enjoyed a resurgence
in demand and profits over the last 12 months.
It has sold a 29.9 per cent stake to Renwick Group, a Devon-based maker of
yachts and motor cruisers owned by Kangra Holdings, a South African group.
Renwick paid 350p a share for 1m shares against an unchanged closing price
of 400p.
The Newington family will retain a 24.74 per cent stake.
Mr Sam Newington, chairman, said the intention of the sale was to 'free up
the family holding.' Fairline would 'continue to operate independently under
its existing management' and Renwick had not sought representation on the
board, he said.
The agreement states that no Newington family member can sell shares for 6
months.
Mr Newington said there were no rationalisation plans and the dividend
policy remains unchanged.

FT  28 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Improved volumes for BAT's tobacco side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAT Industries strongly defended prospects for its tobacco business
yesterday, and reported improved volumes and profits in the US in spite of
the political backlash against smoking.
BAT said Brown &amp; Williamson, the third largest cigarette company in the US,
increased market share in the first half of 1994 from 10.3 per cent to 11.3
per cent, largely recovering the share it lost last year when Philip Morris
cut the price of Marlboro cigarettes.
B&amp;W increased domestic volumes by 20 per cent following a shake-up of its
sales force, and export volumes by more than 10 per cent. Operating profits
increased 76 per cent to Pounds 217m, benefiting from price increases in
value-for-money brands which account for 60 per cent of its US business.
BAT's performance outside the US was also strong. British-American Tobacco
lifted trading profits 9 per cent, in spite of difficult conditions in some
markets. Sales and profits in all operating divisions were up, with
particularly strong performances in Chile, Argentina, Singapore, Indonesia
and Australia.
However, trading profits were down at BAT Cigarettenfabriken, the German
business, because of a provision for relocation of a research facility.
German sales improved, although total exports fell in spite of a big
increase in exports to eastern Europe.
A problem area was the Souza Cruz business in Brazil, where Pounds 80m
profits last year were wiped out by weak economic conditions which led to
downtrading and increased cross-border imports. BAT said action by the
Brazilian government to stabilise the economy was likely to lead to
improvement next year.
Imperial Tobacco in Canada increased volumes and profits, benefiting from
the elimination of border trade after domestic tax reductions.

FT  28 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Waiting for life to take a turn for the
better - Alison Smith considers the prospects for a depressed sector of the
insurance market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The good and the bad news for the life assurance industry was encapsulated
yesterday at the announcement of the first half results for Lloyds Abbey
Life, the life assurance group.
The good news was set out by Mr Stephen Maran, chief executive, who said
that in the longer term, demographics and consumer perception of the limited
extent of state provision in the future meant that there would be a revival
in the pensions market. A low-inflation environment would also contribute to
an active investment market.
The more immediate bad news was underlined by Sir Simon Hornby, chairman,
who said that sales were unlikely to grow in the short term because
consumers were reluctant to make a commitment to long-term life assurance
and recent publicity had undermined public confidence in the industry.
The question for the whole life industry is how to get from where they are
now to the brighter prospects some way away.
Current difficulties were seen yesterday by the restructuring and reduction
of the direct life and pensions sales force of Norwich Union.
At the same time, the 40 per cent drop in new business at Black Horse
Financial Services, the Lloyds Abbey Life 'bancassurer' which sells only to
Lloyds Bank customers, offered a vivid illustration of how life has not
improved since the poor figures for the industry as a whole in the first
quarter were published by the Association of British Insurers in May.
The ABI figures showed a sharp fall in the sale of single premium personal
pensions and a 9 per cent drop in new annual premium income from life
assurance and annuities to Pounds 378m, against Pounds 417m in the 1993
first quarter.
Last week, Prudential Corporation, the UK's largest life insurer, reported
that UK sales of single and annual premium life and pensions policies fell
by almost one fifth in the first six months of this year compared with the
same period in 1993.
Refuge has reported a 30 per cent fall in sales of life products and
pensions; Legal &amp; General has reported a fall of just over 16 per cent in UK
sales of life and pensions new premium business to the end of June;
Britannic Assurance has recorded a smaller drop.
Insurers such as Sun Life, which yesterday reported a 13 per cent increase
in new business, are rare.
The relationship between the life industry and its regulators has depressed
business in two ways.
First, there is the impact on the company itself. Programmes for
re-assessing and re-training the sales force - whether voluntarily or
compulsorily - means time not spent selling, even if the better-trained
sales agents are eventually more productive.
Similarly, the decision by some companies not to return yet to the sale of
personal pensions to people transferring out of occupational schemes
restricts the range of products they offer.
There is also the more general question of the cost of meeting regulators'
requirements. Mr Maran said yesterday that compliance costs were now seven
or eight times the costs of compliance four or five years ago.
Second, there is the impact on public confidence of the apparently endless
run of publicity for life insurers which have failed to comply with
regulators' requirements.
The widespread concern about the possible mis-selling of pension transfers
which erupted last December will cast a shadow over the industry for many
months to come.
There is some scope for blunting the effect of this by increasing sales of
other products, but there are limits to this.
For example, sales of single premium investment products this year have been
affected by the volatility of the markets, and mortgage-related products
have been hit by the fragility of the housing market recovery.
More fundamentally, pension sales is an essential area of business. Mr Tom
King, marketing general manager of Standard Life, says that pension business
now accounts for 40 per cent of Standard Life's total business. 'It's a core
business these days,' he says.
Beyond pensions, more generalised damage has been inflicted by the publicity
attracted for high street financial institutions such as Norwich Union,
Nationwide and Barclays Life, which have taken remedial action after a visit
from the regulators.
Mr Peter Nowell, group chief actuary at Prudential, is not expecting a
significant improvement in business until next year. Some in the industry
would be more cautious than that, since no-one knows how the new regime for
disclosing information about the product, including charges and costs, to
the customer, will affect business.
Mr Roman Cizdyn, insurance analyst at Smith New Court, believes it will be a
long time - probably 1996 - before new business figures show an upturn, but
that does not stop him being reasonably confident about the quoted
companies.
'In a horrid market, they are relatively well-placed. There are life offices
a lot worse than they are,' he said.

FT  28 JUL 94 / People: Wyatt gets bullish on sales
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At weekends, Carol Wyatt helps her husband rebuild their house near Slough.
But for the next two years or so, Groupe Bull's newly appointed director of
sales will spend her weekdays in Paris, building the group's international
open systems and software sales team.
No technologist - 'I'm personal computer literate - just,' she says - Wyatt
has deployed her management and organisational skills to good effect since
joining Bull, then Honeywell Bull, in 1983.
Her sales triumphs include leading teams responsible for winning major
central government orders for computer systems for the prison service and
the Inland Revenue.
What does it take for success in these bids? Wyatt says: 'The secret is to
pick the right people with the right skills for the sales team - especially
when there is little difference between manufacturers' hardware'.
Most recently Wyatt has been director of customer care and communications at
Bull UK.
In her new job she will be responsible for managing the resources to drive
sales of open - or industry standard - systems in all the 100 or so
countries where Bull is represented.
She will ensure the appropriate skills from whatever part of Bull's
worldwide operations will be available to support sales bids - especially
those aimed at medium sized projects.
It is a critically important task at Bull, still losing money heavily and
seeking a new role in the world data processing business. 'Tense' is how she
describes the mood inside the company.
Her Paris location, however, will enable her to dust off and exploit an
earlier skill. After leaving college, she worked as a bilingual secretary,
with special fluency in French.

FT  28 JUL 94 / People: European representation expands on board of media
group Aegis
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Aegis group, the pan-European media planning and buying specialist, has
appointed Kai Hiemstra, 55, right, as an executive director on the group's
main board.
The move has a special flavour to it: 'We could count on the fingers of one
hand the numbers of German nationals who are non-executives on the board of
British companies. To appoint a full executive director like this is quite
unusual,' says the German-British chamber of commerce in London.
An experienced advertising figure, Hiemstra is founder and chairman of HMS
Media Service, based in Wiesbaden, Germany. HMS has grown into Germany's
largest media buying and planning specialist, with a 12 per cent market
share.
While there is a sprinkling of Germans on various boards in the City, the
ranks thin somewhat outside the financial world.
Among the better-known are Gertrud Hohler, founder of an eponymous firm of
management consultants in Germany, who has been a Grand Metropolitan
non-executive director since 1992.
The year before, Ellen Schneider-Lenne, of Deutsche bank, joined ICI, in the
same role. John von Spreckelsen, chief executive of Budgens since May 1991,
is German-born. Martin Kohlhaussen was a non-executive at Tiphook until
March this year, and the former Volkswagen boss, Carl Hahn, is a
non-executive with BP. Most famous perhaps is Dieter Bock, joint chief
executive at Lonrho.
Hiemstra's elevation bolsters the group's European outlook; the board now
has representatives from the US, France, Switzerland, the UK and now
Germany. 'It's a genuinely European board,' says Aegis, 'where all group
business is conducted in English.'
Aegis acquired 50 per cent of HMS in 1988, the remaining half in 1993, when
the billings of HMS represented 30 per cent of the total for the Aegis
group.

joined PhilDrew Ventures in 1988, three years after the venture capital
house was established by a team that left Prudential Ventures.
Robert Jenkins, one of the six remaining partners at PhilDrew Ventures, said
Gonszor left at the start of the month after a series of differences of
opinion about the way the partnership should be run.
Jenkins said none of the differences were about significant matters and
there had been no differences of opinion with either Phillips and Drew Fund

PhilDrew Ventures has been one of the more successful venture capital

FT  28 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Institutions call for change at Enterprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Norwich Union and the Prudential Corporation want Mr Graham Hearne, chairman
and chief executive of Enterprise Oil, to surrender his role as chairman.
The two institutions, which jointly own 10 per cent of Enterprise's shares,
have together had a meeting with Mr Hearne and are waiting to hear how he
plans to respond to their concerns. They are the biggest holders of
Enterprise shares among investment institutions.
There had been widespread speculation that Mr Hearne would be forced by
investors, unhappy with his management of Enterprise's failed Pounds 1.6bn
bid for Lasmo, to give up his role as chief executive.
However, Prudential and Norwich believe it is in shareholders' interest for
Mr Hearne to remain as chief executive, a position he has held since 1984,
and for a new chairman to be found.
The two institutions appear to be on a collision course with Enterprise and
its board. It is the board's policy that over the coming two years the
company should find a new chief executive to succeed Mr Hearne, who is 56.
A friend of Mr Hearne said: 'It could all get very nasty. Graham is in no
mood to stand down as chairman'.
Mr William Bell, Enterprise's senior non-executive director who until 1991
was chairman of the oil company, is in the process of offering to meet
Norwich and the Prudential to discuss their concerns.
He will tell them that the company already had a strategy to establish a
counterweight to Mr Hearne by the recent appointment of Mr Michael Pink as
chief operating officer.
The anxieties of the two institutions would not be allayed if Mr Bell were
to offer a compromise solution of speeding up the search for a new chief
executive, which could be Mr Pink, though he is only a year younger than Mr
Hearne.

FT  28 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Lloyds Abbey Life shows 13% advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyds Abbey Life, the life assurance group, yesterday reported a rise in
pre-tax profits for the first half of 1993 to Pounds 171.8m - 13 per cent
higher than the same period last year - despite sharp falls in sales by its
two core life insurance subsidiaries, writes Alison Smith.
Sir Simon Hornby, group chairman, said that the life assurance companies
were trading in a market where sales were unlikely to grow in the
short-term, but that both were responding to market conditions by
intensifying training and making substantial changes to the sales process.
He highlighted the impact of recent unfavourable publicity about the life
industry as a whole, which has focused on the possible mis-selling of
personal pensions to people transferring out of occupational schemes and on
general levels of training and of compliance with regulators' requirements.
The steepest fall in performance was in Black Horse Financial Services, a
'bancassurance' company selling products only to customers of Lloyds Bank.
It recorded a drop in sales of 40 per cent.
Abbey Life, the group's other UK life assurance division, suffered a drop in
sales of 8 per cent. Mr Stephen Maran, group chief executive, said Abbey
Life's performance was broadly in line with the market.
He attributed about half the drop in BHFS's sales to the extensive amount of
time devoted to training rather than selling during the six-month period.
A further factor in the fall in business is that the group has not yet
re-entered the pensions transfer market.
Within the Pounds 171.8m total pre-tax profits, BHFS fell 27 per cent to
Pounds 44.1m (Pounds 60m), while Abbey Life slipped back to Pounds 66.9m
(Pounds 69m).
The increase in group profits was largely due to the recovery in Lloyds
Bowmaker, the finance company, both in terms of income and a sharp fall in
the charge for bad debts.
Its pre-tax profits almost trebled, rising to Pounds 33.5m from Pounds
11.5m.
Earnings per share for the group rose 14 per cent to 16.3p (14.3p), and the
interim dividend is increased 8 per cent to 6.8p (6.3p).
The impact of regulation on the life industry was also reflected in comments
from Sun Life, despite its 13 per cent increase in new busi-ness for the
first half of the year at Pounds 182.6m (Pounds 161.1m) reported yes-terday.
Mr John Reeve, managing director, said although the group had improved on
earlier results against the industry trend, he expected regulatory
pressures, keener competition and a contracting market 'will make it
unlikely that the current rate of year-on-year increase will be sustained
for the full year'.

FT  28 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Water board nomination raises
accountability debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A leading pension fund consultancy is considering backing the nomination of
a former water industry regulator to the board of Yorkshire Water. The
nomination of Mrs Diana Scott, former chairman of the Yorkshire Water
Services Committee, has been opposed by Yorkshire's directors.
Pensions and Investment Research Consultants, which advises 16 local
authority pension funds with Pounds 18bn in assets, said the nomination
raised several important issues about privatised utilities.
'Our clients have become increasingly concerned about their lack of
accountability in areas such as disconnections, directors' pay and
environmental performance,' said Mr Stuart Bell, research director.
Mrs Scott was nominated by a shareholders' resolution which requires the
backing of more than 100 investors holding more than Pounds 10,000 in share
capital. Mr Bell said such proposals were highly unusual, although
increasing. There have been two other such resolutions this year, at Norweb
and British Aerospace.

FT  28 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Mobile side supports BT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 781m in the
three months to June 30, a 3.2 per cent increase on last time's Pounds 757m.
Before redundancy charges profits advanced 2.1 per cent.
Turnover increased 1.4 per cent to Pounds 3.38bn (Pounds 3.34bn). However,
the company had to rely largely on a sharp increase in income from mobile
services and Cellnet, its cellular joint venture with Securicor, to offset a
2.6 per cent fall in turnover in its core national and international
traffic.
Allowing for discontinued activities turnover was up by 2.5 per cent.
Although BT faced increased competition in the opening quarter from Mercury
and cable operators building local networks, it blamed the fall in traffic
income on large price reductions made under an agreement with Oftel, the
telecoms regulator, which obliges it to reduce call charges by 7.5 per cent
a year after allowing for inflation.
BT estimated that net price reductions cost it Pounds 120m in the quarter.
It will have to make further price cuts in the autumn. Sir Iain Vallance,
chairman, warned that the next round of price cuts and additional redundancy
costs 'will be moderating influences on our full-year results'.
Part of the impact of the price cuts was offset by a 7 per cent increase in
inland traffic since last year and a 5 per cent rise in international
traffic. It pointed to the sharp increase in inland traffic, which compared
with a 2 per cent increase between the same quarters in 1992 and 1993, as
evidence of the success of its current campaign to encourage greater phone
usage.
Exchange line rental income grew by 4.2 per cent to Pounds 620m, reflecting
continuing line growth and an increase in line rental prices.
A 12 per cent increase in revenue from other sales and services to Pounds
791m was mainly due to increased activity at Cellnet and BT's mobile
division. The number of Cellnet cellular connections rose by 128,000 to
1.15m.
BT's redundancy programme reduced the number employed by 1,700 to 154,300.
Redundancy costs were Pounds 54m. Total redundancy costs for the current
year are projected at Pounds 750m.
Eliminating redundancy charges, staff costs were 3.5 per cent lower.
Mr Laurence Heyworth, telecoms analyst at Robert Fleming, said BT's
underlying position was robust, with line growth of 100,000 a month,
aggregating the cellular and fixed-line sectors.
Earnings per share rose by 2.5 per cent to 8.1p (7.9p).

FT  28 JUL 94 / Ford more than doubles to record Dollars 1.7bn for quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford of the US, the world's second largest vehicle maker, exceeded market
forecasts and more than doubled its net profit in the second quarter to a
record Dollars 1.71bn (Pounds 1.1bn) from Dollars 775m a year ago.
The profits of the big three US carmakers are rising sharply, helped by the
continuing strength of the US market and the start of recovery in Europe.
Chrysler recently announced record quarterly earnings of Dollars 956m for
the second quarter, and General Motors is expected to report a big jump in
profits today.
Ford's group net profit in the first six months virtually doubled to Dollars
2.62bn from Dollars 1.35bn, while turnover rose 14.2 per cent to Dollars
64.2bn. The net profits of its worldwide automotive operations quadrupled in
the first six months to Dollars 2.14bn (Dollars 571m).
In the second quarter Ford's automotive operations tripled net profits to
Dollars 1.18bn from Dollars 395m. The after-tax return on automotive sales
jumped to 4.2 per cent from 1.7 per cent.
Net income from Ford's US automotive operations rose in the second quarter
to Dollars 907m from Dollars 367m. Automotive earnings outside the US
increased to Dollars 276m from only Dollars 28m, helped by a return to
profit in Europe.
Ford's financial services group, one of the most profitable financial
services companies in the world, earned a record Dollars 528m (Dollars 380m)
in the second quarter.
Group turnover worldwide in the second quarter rose 15 per cent to Dollars
33.8bn (Dollars 29.4bn), while Ford vehicle sales increased by 8.1 per cent
to 1.8m.
Mr Alex Trotman, chairman and chief executive, said: 'We feel good about
these improvements, but we are by no means satisfied.' The group, which has
launched a far-reaching reorganisation aimed at merging its North American
and European automotive operations into one unit by the end of the year, had
to remain focused on improving its return on automotive sales, he said.
The sharp rise in profits at Ford, following big losses in 1991 and 1992, is
being supported by increasing demand for new vehicles in the US, where
overall sales of cars and light trucks jumped 11 per cent in the first half
of the year to 7.76m.
Ford forecast that total US car and truck sales in 1994 would rise by about
9 per cent to 15.5m. Its share of the US market declined slightly in the
first half to 24.9 per cent from 25.4 per cent a year ago.
The profitability of Ford's US automotive operations has been helped by
falling marketing costs with its retail incentives reduced to Dollars 550
per vehicle in the second quarter from Dollars 755 a year ago.
Ford has reduced the share of vehicles it sells to fleets to 25 per cent of
its total sales in the second quarter from 28 per cent a year ago, and the
mix of its sales is improving with a rising share of sales of more
profitable light trucks.

FT  28 JUL 94 / BAT defies US tobacco propaganda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAT Industries, the UK-based tobacco and financial services group, announced
a 5 per cent increase in half-year profits to Pounds 948m before tax in the
face of what it called 'unprecedented propaganda' against the tobacco
industry in the US.
The figures - towards the top end of expectations - were helped by a strong
performance from BAT's US tobacco company Brown &amp; Williamson. It recovered
market share lost in last year's price war sparked by rival Philip Morris
and lifted trading profits 76 per cent to Pounds 217m.
Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman, said the US figures 'largely speak for
themselves' and showed BAT was weathering the political backlash against
cigarette-smoking.
'We have been subjected to a period of unprecedented propaganda in the US,'
he said. 'The board, however, remains confident of the tobacco industry's
ability to continue to defend itself successfully, not only in court but
wherever a more balanced view is taken.'
He said BAT was pressing ahead with its proposed Dollars 1bn (Pounds 655m)
acquisition of American Tobacco, the fifth largest US cigarette company,
although completion was unlikely before the end of the year.
The strong performance from Brown &amp; Williamson resulted from a more stable
US market, increased domestic sales and exports, and improved margins on its
GPC brand.
Operating profits last year of Pounds 80m in BAT's Brazilian business were
wiped out this time by difficult economic conditions. But a strong
performance from the international British-American Tobacco business helped
the tobacco division lift operating profits to Pounds 576m - an increase of
8 per cent, stripping out an exceptional gain of Pounds 135m last year on a
brands swap with US company American Brands.
On the financial services side, operating profits increased 10 per cent to
Pounds 439m, with a Pounds 193m contribution from life and investment
business, and Pounds 246m from general business.
Total profit from continuing operations at Eagle Star in the UK rose from
Pounds 45m to Pounds 69m, with UK personal lines business performing well,
and no further provisions made for its discontinued financial insurance
operations.
Allied Dunbar lifted its contribution 14 per cent to Pounds 84m. The single
premium investment side was strong, but new life and pensions business were
both lower.
In the US, Farmers recorded flat profits of Pounds 252m, reflecting a lower
contribution from the life business.
Total group turnover from continuing operations for the six months to June
30 increased from Pounds 11.9bn to Pounds 12bn, but BAT's shares fell 9p to
434p in spite of the profits increase, as investors took profits after a
strong recent performance by the shares.
The interim dividend increased 8 per cent to 8.5p, although earnings per
share increased only 1 per cent from 19.3p to 19.4p.

FT  28 JUL 94 / K-factors and their knock-on effects: Water prices over the
next five years will be determined by today's announcement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The water industry regulator will today unveil the rate at which he will
allow the 31 water and sewerage companies of England and Wales to increase
prices over the next 10 years.
Most analysts are expecting Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of the Office of
Water Services (Ofwat), to aim for an average annual weighted increase,
between 1995 and 2000, of more than 1 per cent above inflation - the formula
known as the K-factor.
Such an outcome, says Mr Graeme Moyse, of stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson,
would allow the 10 water and sewerage companies to maintain dividend growth
at an attractive 3 per cent per annum above inflation for the next five
years. It is almost certain Ofwat will re-examine price increases in 1999,
rendering comments on the last five years of the period under review
virtually irrelevant.
While the K-factor has been the focus of publicity, Mr Byatt's decisions on
the amount of capital spending to sanction for each company will be equally
important. Just over a year ago, water companies submitted market plans to
the regulator showing obligations believed to total between Pounds 20bn and
Pounds 25bn for the sector as a whole. Talks between the Department of the
Environment and Ofwat are thought to have reduced the number by at least a
quarter. It will become clear today which companies are set to benefit most
from those discussions.
For individual companies, a high capital expenditure allowance would imply a
high K-factor. However, Mr Byatt has said he intends to place more of the
funding burden on the companies. So, a tough approach would be to sanction a
large amount of capital spending, but be stingy with the price increase.
Companies, already expecting flat earnings over the next five years, would
be forced to eat further into their own resources to fund the spending. Such
an approach from Ofwat would rely on harsh efficiency targets, also to be
announced today.
Those trying to determine a list of winners and losers in today's
announcement are unlikely to get much guidance from the companies or from
Ofwat.
Individual companies were informed of their own K-factors yesterday, but
they will be keenly interested to see how they have fared compared with
others in the sector before they comment. If some feel hard done by, they
have two months to appeal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Thus,
the uncertainty which has plagued the sector for the last year is unlikely
to evaporate overnight.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Euro Disney cuts its operating loss despite revenue fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Euro Disney, the troubled leisure group, announced a net loss of FFr546m
(Pounds 66m) for the third quarter to the end of June, but said that
operating losses had been reduced sharply from FFr381m to FFr194m.
The increase in losses at the net level was the result of a one-off charge
of FFr352m relating to a financial restructuring at the company, which is
implementing a rescue package after suffering losses of FFr5.3bn last year.
The reduction in operating losses was achieved despite a fall in revenues at
the theme park and its hotels from FFr1.47bn in the third quarter of 1993 to
FFr1.16bn this year. Euro Disney blamed a more aggressive pricing strategy
and lower attendances after uncertainty last year over the future of the
theme park.
'Some people outside of the company were talking of the possibility that we
might have to close,' it said. 'This was never justified, but had an
unsettling effect on clients and potential customers.'
The reduction in operating losses was attributed to efforts to improve
operating margins, a cut in general and administrative expenses and, most
importantly, to the initial effects of the company's financial restructuring
package which was concluded earlier this year.
Property lease expenses, for example, fell by about 50 per cent due to
interest waivers, while no royalties were paid in the quarter to Walt
Disney, the US entertainment group which holds 49 per cent of the shares.
Euro Disney said that its FFr5.95bn rights issue would be completed by
mid-August. The proceeds will reduce debts, which stand at about FFr16bn,
excluding convertible bonds.
The seven-for-two rights issue was priced at FFr10 a share. Yesterday, Euro
Disney's shares remained stable at FFr10.
Walt Disney has pledged to take up its full entitlement to the rights issue,
which is also being underwritten by Euro Disney's banking syndicate. Prince
al-Waleed bin Talal, the Saudi investor, is also set to take a stake of up
to 24 per cent.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Transatlantic Reuters advances 14%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Reuters Holdings, the financial information and news group, underlined its
international credentials yesterday by crossing the Atlantic to report a 14
per cent increase in interim profits.
The UK-based group presented its results for the six months to June 30 in
New York, where about a third of its equity is listed as American Depositary
Receipts. Analysts and journalists in London participated by satellite in
the presentation.
Mr Peter Job, chief executive, said this use of technology provided a 'truly
level playing field' - information was released in London and New York at
the same time, and questioners were able to judge the demeanour of
executives.
Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 245m on revenue which increased 22 per cent
to Pounds 1.09bn. The revenue figure contained Pounds 55m from acquisitions,
including Quotron, the US-based equity trading service, and Teknekron, which
supplies digital trading systems to banks. Excluding acquisitions, revenue
rose 16 per cent.
Reuters said it paid net cash of Pounds 102m for the acquisitions, but
confirmed it could receive up to Dollars 100m to cover Quotron's continuing
losses, until 1996, from its vendor, the US bank Citicorp. Mr Job said
Quotron would retain about 37,000 screens and was on target to be profitable
by 1996.
Instinet, the US-based equity brokerage service, and Thamesway, the
institutional broker which Reuters bought in November, more than doubled
profits to Pounds 26m.
Mr Job said: 'We experienced record levels of new orders in the first half,
reflecting generally favourable business conditions. Following the
corrections in the bonds and equities markets, we saw lower levels of new
orders in May and June but they were comfortably ahead of last year.'
Europe and the Americas generated strong growth with Asia held back by a
lacklustre Japan. Emerging markets continued to flourish.
Mr Job played down Globex, the group's loss-making venture into electronic
futures trading, which has recently been rejected by London and one of the
Chicago exchanges. He accepted the group could have spent about Dollars 100m
to date on the project, but emphasised the financial impact would be much
less - even if it were closed.
The group's operating margin declined slightly, from 20.6 per cent to 20 per
cent, mainly because of acquisitions and new investment programmes. Mr Job
acknowledged 'a depressant effect (on margins) from going into other
markets, which we intend to do. We have no particular ambition to improve
the margin, because it's pretty high at the moment.'
Net cash fell from Pounds 450m to Pounds 428m. Earnings per share grew 21
per cent to 10.4p (8.6p), boosted by last year's Pounds 351m buy-back of
shares. The interim dividend rose 23 per cent to 1.9p (1.55p).

Jaguar, Ford's UK luxury car subsidiary, remained in the red in the second
quarter with an unchanged operating loss of Dollars 62m. Ford said Jaguar
was expected to return to profit in 1995. The business had shown an
underlying improvement following cost cutting and improved product quality.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Cardiff wins Pounds 200m TV component plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Japanese-German joint venture to make television components, involving a
planned investment of nearly Pounds 200m, is to be set up at Cardiff Bay. Up
to 750 jobs are expected to be created in what is potentially one of the
biggest inward investments yet in Wales.
The venture, between Nippon Electric Glass and Schott Glaswerke, will make
glass for cathode ray tubes. The first customer will be the Sony television
plant at Bridgend in south Wales, which at present imports these components.
The factory is the most important manufacturing investment yet won by the
Cardiff Bay Development Corporation, which is responsible for regenerating
2,700 acres of old docklands. Site preparation for the factory will begin
next month and production is due to start next year.
Initially, Pounds 30m will be invested and 70 people employed in grinding
and polishing panels. But the joint venture intends to develop a fully
integrated manufacturing facility for cathode ray glass over five years.
Depending on the market, the companies forecast an investment of Pounds 193m
and a workforce of up to 750 people over that period.
Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, described it as 'an immense vote of
confidence in Wales by two world leaders in their field. For them to choose
south Wales over competing sites throughout Europe is further proof of our
attraction to international companies'.
NEG and Schott will receive an undisclosed amount of regional selective
assistance from the Welsh Office. The development corporation will provide
financial help, which is still being negotiated, in the construction costs
of the factory.
Sir Geoffrey Inkin, chairman of the corporation, said the announcement was
'a major industrial milestone in the regeneration of Cardiff Bay'.
Mr Michael Boyce, chief executive, said: 'I can't think of a more important
inward investment for us to attract - we have shared everyone's concern
about the weakening of Cardiff's manufacturing base.'
It is the first large deal struck by the development corporation since work
started in May, after protracted opposition, to construct a barrage across
Cardiff Bay to create a freshwater lake.

FT  28 JUL 94 / MPs urge early lifting ofban on BT video service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications should be allowed to offer video-on-demand and
home shopping on a UK 'electronic superhighway' before the end of the
decade, a House of Commons committee said yesterday.
That is one of the radical changes in the regulatory regime for broadcasting
and telecommunications called for by the trade and industry select committee
to ensure the rapid construction of such a network.
The key recommendation of its report on optical-fibre networks is for a
progressive lifting of the ban on BT using its network to carry
entertainment services.
Existing government policy, designed to encourage investment in local cable
systems by cable operators competing with BT, is for the ban to stay in
place until at least 2001, with a review at some stage after 1998.
Yesterday's report advocates a gradual lifting of the ban over an 8-year
period. BT would be allowed to compete on an equal footing with cable
companies over most of Britain by the late 1990s, with a complete lifting of
the ban in 2002.
Mr Richard Caborn, chairman of the Commons committee, claimed that without a
clear date for ending the ban Britain could lag behind the US and Japan in
the development of interactive 'superhighway' services.
'The potential now exists for an enormous range of new services,' he said,
highlighting home-based services such as video-on-demand and home shopping
and community-based services such as interactive teaching and medical
facilities in schools and hospitals.
It appeared yesterday that Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, would refuse any immediate change in government policy. The
Department of Trade and Industry said that it would formally respond to the
report in the autumn.
However, the cable industry gave a guarded welcome to the report. Mr Richard
Woollam, director-general of the Cable Television Association, which
represents the - mostly US-owned - cable companies building local networks,
said: 'I don't think anyone in the cable industry really expected the ban to
go on beyond 2001.'
This raised the prospect of a broad industry consensus on a raising of the
BT ban which could make it easier for Mr Heseltine to set a firm date for
its abolition. The report's recommendations are broadly in line with Labour
party policy.
BT, which campaigned hard for an early lifting of the ban, welcomed the
report, noting that the proposal to restrict the period of protection from
BT competition in entertainment services for individual cable franchises
would free BT to compete over most of the country by 1998. It said it had
the Pounds 15bn necessary to extend fibre-optics into local networks if the
ban was lifted.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Pounds 100m levy proposed on packaging tofund waste
recycling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Proposals for a Pounds 100m levy on packaging were put forward yesterday to
pay for a nationwide scheme to recycle packaging waste.
The levy would be paid by manufacturers and users of packaging material, but
would be passed on to the consumer, who would pay about 1p more for every
Pounds 10 of purchases.
The plan comes in a long-awaited report by Sir Sydney Lipworth in response
to a request by Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, that industry
find ways of recovering between 50 per cent and 75 per cent of waste by the
year 2000.
Sir Sydney, a former chairman of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, is
an adviser to the Producer Responsibility Group, an alliance of packaging
and manufacturing companies and retailers which is putting together a waste
recycling plan.
His report recommends that all big users of packaging as well as wholesalers
and retailers should be registered. The registered users, known as packers
and fillers, would be liable for the levy.
Manufacturers and importers of packaging who sold to unregistered users
would be liable themselves. Retailers and wholesalers would not be liable
for the levy where it was already included in the price of the packaging.
Sir Sydney says that there should be provisions to prevent value added tax
being charged on the levy.
The plan envisages that waste would be collected by organisations
representing the various types of packaging materials. They would seek the
best way of recovering value from the waste, whether by recycling or by
using it as a fuel.
The recycling would be financed by the proceeds of the levy, which would
also be used to help prime markets for recovered packaging. The plan is
designed to recycle about 58 per cent of UK packaging waste.
There will be a six-week consultation before the proposals are presented to
the Department of the Environment. If they are acceptable to Mr Gummer,
legislation will be brought forward.
Last night the British Retail Consortium, representing 90 per cent of the
retail industry, said it welcomed the report.

The directors of Yorkshire Water are perfectly entitled to voice their
objections should patently unsuitable candidates put themselves forward for
election to the board. But their heavy-handed efforts to prevent the
election of Mrs Diana Scott look misplaced. While Mrs Scott is short on
industrial experience, she has worked within the regulatory regime and is
familiar with its consumerist concerns. That alone makes her, at least,
worthy of unbiased consideration by shareholders. Even monopolies cannot
afford to ignore their customers.

<TEXT>
As the political tensions in Italy mount, the contrarian investor might be
tempted to buy. The battered lira appears substantially undervalued against
the D-Mark, sharpening Italy's international competitiveness. Corporate
earnings are likely to rebound even more strongly as a result. Italian bond
yields reflect far more than any realistic expectations about inflation,
which stands at a 25-year low.
The real fear for investors, though, concerns Italy's budget deficit. On
some calculations, the government needs to run a primary surplus of 3 per
cent of GDP a year to cope with the strain. Belgium has shown that is
possible. But it will take real political muscle to tackle health and
pension spending in Italy. That seems uncertain when the political situation
remains so volatile. The contrarian investor will dave to be bolder than
ever.

FT  28 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: UK gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If yesterday's Pounds 2bn auction of conventional gilts was supposed to set
the seal on the market's recovery, it has been a signal failure. Those of a
technical bent may draw comfort from the thought that a low cover ratio does
not necessarily matter when all the bids are clustered together. It may
simply mean that the market found the auction easy to price. But the fact
remains that total bids of only Pounds 2.58bn were received for a relatively
rare sale of longer-dated paper. Though liquid, domestic institutions are
clearly still cautious about committing cash to the market. Many apparently
used the auction to switch out of existing holdings rather than increase
their investment.
Part of the concern lies in the international environment. There is not much
retail demand in other European bond markets as the lacklustre response to
yesterday's German auction shows. Strong durable goods orders left the
markets feeling nervous about tomorrow's US growth figures. International
markets remain vulnerable to threats of higher US interest rates.
This week's CBI survey is a further reminder that the interest rate turn
looms in the UK, too. It is impossible to tell whether there is anything
behind yesterday afternoon's rumours that the chancellor and the governor of
the Bank of England will use their meeting today to agree a pre-emptive rise
in base rates. There is no pressing need as yet, but the violent reaction of
equities as well as gilts suggests worries about interest rates are becoming
a regular feature, whether the authorities act or not.

FT  28 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: BAT Industries
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Another generous dividend increase from BAT Industries makes the current
valuation of the shares difficult to fathom. Even after the recovery of the
last few weeks, BAT stands close to its highest yield relative to the stock
market since the early 1980s. The shares also command a substantial yield
premium to the composite insurance sector, as they have done since early in
1993. That only makes sense if BAT's insurance operations are expected to
fare much worse than the competition, or if the tobacco side of the business
will be a brake on dividend growth.
Yesterday's half-year figures suggest that neither is the case. Eagle Star
is still suffering from the legacy of mortgage indemnity, but is performing
in line with its peers in other respects. Allied Dunbar seems to be coping
well enough with the regulatory squeeze in life insurance. In tobacco,
cigarette volumes rose by 4 per cent after a period of stagnation. The US
market appears to have returned to equilibrium following Philip Morris's
decision last year to chase market share.
Of course there could be shocks in tobacco to come. While the proposed US
excise tax now looks likely to be far less onerous than the Dollars 1 per
pack suggested last year, the hawkish Food &amp; Drug Administration is
hovering. On balance, though, a slow tightening of the regulatory grip looks
more likely than a sudden blow. In the meantime cash flow from tobacco makes
BAT's promise of real dividend growth look more credible than most.

FT  28 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Flash news from Reuters
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Reuters has not done badly in the 10 years since flotation. Its earnings per
share have increased 8.32 times over that period, its share price more than
nine times. No-one pretends Reuters can match that record in the next
decade. Nevertheless, the company is one of the few FT-SE 100 stocks that
promises organic revenue growth of more than 10 per cent a year for the
foreseeable future. Reuters may achieve even more if it can successfully
leverage its financial markets expertise into new fields, such as medical
information. Add a splash of multimedia appeal as Reuters diversifies into
television and radio and it adds up to a compelling investment story.
Still, the market was not in such stargazing mood yesterday. Instead it
knocked 5 per cent off Reuters' shares, chiefly on worries about the slight
shrinkage of operating margins. That, though, owes more to recent
acquisitions, such as Quotron, which have inflated the revenue line but have
 -as yet - contributed no extra income. The continuing doubts about Globex
also cast a shadow out of proportion to its financial significance.
Moreover, the success of Instinet and Dealing 2000/2 should more than
compensate.
The real issue therefore is not whether to buy Reuters but what premium to
pay for it. The market may have pushed the rating far enough for the time
being especially as Reuters' new orders have softened this summer. But as
the charms of cyclical recovery stocks fade when the UK interest rate cycle
turns, Reuters should come back into its own.

No such thing as ageism at the top of Swiss companies. Fritz Gerber,
chairman of both pharma group Roche and Zurich Insurance, and who is 65, has
just told Weltwoche magazine that he has no intention of retiring. 'I will
go on working as long as I feel I am able to fulfil my task,' he announced.
The heads of Switzerland's other big pharmaceutical groups are almost
equally good, if not better, advertisements for their drugs. Alex Krauer,
boss of Ciba, is a mere 63, but Marc Moret continues to dominate Sandoz at
70.
And financiers and industrialists are clearly pretty good customers of the
above. Nestle boss Helmut Maucher is nudging 67, Credit Suisse's Rainer Gut
is nearly 62 and Peter Spalti, Winterthur Insurance boss, is a sprightly 63.
'I hope I will be able to recognise when it is time to step down,' Gerber
said gracefully in his interview. Providing he does, who would complain?

Still, outings for his oeuvre on Radio 1 and Kiss FM have not gone to his

The title of the single, 'Give me life', is impressively ambiguous however.
Does it betray a secret wish to escape from his current position or should

French culture minister Jacques Toubon's wild attempts to purify his
nation's language must be alarming all serious etymologists, if a glossary
of franglais business applications provided by L'Expansion magazine is
anything to go by. Far from being a linguistic abomination, it appears
instead to be an entirely new language in the making - and certainly one in
need of translation, most of all to the Brits.
Elliptically, if your opposite number in France lets on that he is expecting
a visit from 'des gens d'Arthur' (people from Arthur), it means that
accountants Arthur Andersen are on their way. Yet more cryptically, if your
Parisian subsidiary suggests going into 'le food', far from betraying
culinary ambitions, it is telling you it intends to adopt mass-marketing
techniques. Last but not least is the 'earing', as in the sort of thing the
US congress is currently holding over Whitewater. And no, the cover date of
the magazine is not April 1.

Let's for a moment accept that his recent visit to South Africa 'ended in

it is possible that Britain's trade minister returned 'a richer human being
for the privilege of sharing this dawn of a new historic era', as the same
document enthuses. But he really cannot get away with yesterday's press
release which talks of a trade support and assistance package for South
Africa worth Pounds 1.25 bn, 'the largest offered by any country since the
South African elections'. All fine and dandy except that an Export Credits
Guarantee Department facility just happened to have been available before he
set off; so deduct at least Pounds 1bn. As that old maxim goes, there are
lies, damn lies and aid statistics.

Hiding among the pile were a few paragraphs to the effect that the
Commission had struck a deal with Arbed, the Luxembourg steel-maker that is
buying into Germany's Klockner Werke, whereby Arbed would close a steel mill
as part of a debt write-off already agreed with Klockner. Only problem was,
the decision had not yet been taken and officials said the statement should

An exciting February stock market debut for Clinical Computing's shares will
have been scant comfort to its investors this week. On Tuesday, the medical
software company had a minor emergency of its own - a Pounds 227,000 loss
for the first half of the year.
At least one shareholder was, however, considerably placated yesterday when
he received a letter from Jeremy Woan, the chief executive. Acknowledging
that private investors might 'feel isolated' at results reporting time when
senior management is rolled out to talk to the institutional investors, the
letter proposes a rather simple home-spun alternative. Woan and his
colleagues are making themselves available by phone at certain hours today
and Monday.
Let's hope the company will soon be of a size where it becomes impractical
for the boss to bend his ear to shareholder concerns in such a direct
fashion. Then he has to come up with an equally refreshing way to deal with
the concerns of larger pools of investors.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Leading Article: The task for Mr Berlusconi
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If it is true that revolutions devour their children, then Italy could be
preparing for a rather indigestible feast. In elections four months ago, Mr
Silvio Berlusconi gained the prime ministership at the helm of his Forza
Italia movement with a mandate that included cleaning up corruption.
Following signs this week that Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest company may have
been involved in malpractice, doubts are increasing whether he has the
ability or will to achieve this mandate.
With some justification, Mr Berlusconi has been seeking to accelerate the
wearisome judicial process affecting politicians, functionaries and business
executives implicated in corruption inquiries. Some people detained on
suspicion of bribery during the last two years have undoubtedly suffered
from miscarriages of justice. Earlier this month, Mr Berlusconi introduced a
decree limiting magistrates' powers of arrest in corruption cases, but
quickly withdrew it after a public outcry.
Accelerating the judicial process - and limiting abuses of judicial power -
may well be desirable. The problem is that Mr Berlusconi cannot be regarded
as impartial. In his two months in office, for example, he has shown
insufficient readiness to resolve the basic conflict of interest caused by
Fininvest's dominant media position. The admission this week by lawyers
acting for a Fininvest executive that the company paid bribes to the
country's financial police has further damaged Mr Berlusconi's credibility.
More urgently than ever, Mr Berlusconi must now separate his interests as a
businessman from his duties and responsibilities as Italy's prime minister.
Ideally, he would make a clear-cut public statement detailing any past
Fininvest impropriety, combined with a firm commitment to divest his
holding.
Without such action, any government attempts to influence the bribery
investigations, for instance by bringing in milder treatment for less severe
misdemeanours, would increase suspicion that the prime minister is simply
protecting his business interests. Further, the fall-out of the corruption
dispute risks undermining the broader programme for Italian renewal. Sharp
divisions in Mr Berlusconi's coalition are lowering the chances of
implementing the rigorous budget the country needs. Additionally, political
uncertainty has damped prospects for further privatisation, a pivotal part
of economic reform.
If Forza Italia's popularity starts seriously to wane, the Northern League,
Mr Berlusconi's main coalition partner, could grow bolder in underlining its
own anti-corruption credentials, perhaps to the extent of bringing down the
government. Early elections would do little to increase the chances of
stability, and might bring fresh political fragmentation. Mr Berlusconi was
elected in part to remove the conditions under which corruption and
malpractice flourished in the past. Unless he puts himself above suspicion,
his chance to perform that task will soon slip away.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Survival at the margins: Gerard Baker and Emiko Terazono ask
if Japanese banks can shake off their bad debt problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER and EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This morning, in one of the stark concrete blocks that scar Tokyo's
financial district, the denizens of Japan's banking community gather for
their annual convention. They will be addressed by a glittering array of
speakers, including Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, central bank governor
Mr Yasushi Mieno, and most members of the financial aristocracy.
The message they will hear is that the long night of Japan's banking crisis
is over. Fortified by the drink and the canapes, some of them may believe
it.
Since they published their annual results in May, the country's 21 main
banks have been anxious to claim that the worst of the bad debt nightmare
that has haunted them for the past four years is over.
The reality is different. It is doubtful whether the bad debt problem itself
has reached the end of the beginning. But more troublesome for the banks is
that their ability to deal with the problem is increasingly constrained
because profits - out of which banks make provisions for bad debts - are
stagnating.
The banks' reversal of fortune has been rapid. Enriched by the country's
vast current account and savings surpluses of the 1980s, they were respected
and feared in boardrooms across the world. Now, though still the largest -
occupying 11 of the top 20 slots in the world league, measured by assets -
the past four years have revealed that size is no substitute for strategy.
The opacity of Japanese accounting practices means it is not easy to gauge
the true scale of the banks' problems. But even the most creative of
accountants could not disguise for long the consequences of the collapse of
the 'bubble economy', the period of spiralling asset prices in the late
1980s. Banks, heavily exposed to an overgrown property sector, watched
helplessly as the collapse came. In the past three years the value of
non-performing loans has nearly doubled.
This year the banks have seen the first signs of hope. Total disclosed
non-performing loans fell by 1.3 per cent from last September to Y13,600bn
(Pounds 90bn) at the end of March - the first fall over a six-month period
since the crisis began.
There has also been a greater sense of realism by the banks. Initially,
their response to the rising level of bad debt was to wait for a return to
economic growth to ease their difficulties. In part, this was because they
were labouring under a regulatory regime run by the Ministry of Finance
which, with an eye on tax revenues, frowned upon bad debt provisions, since
they are offset against tax.
But last year, as the ministry loosened the reins, banks began to make
sensible provisions. This year, write-offs and provisions at the 21 leading
banks totalled Y3,855bn. Provisions as a proportion of disclosed problem
loans rose from 28.9 per cent in March 1993 to 33.5 per cent a year later.
Sumitomo Bank is one bank that has become much more bullish about its
prospects. 'Our aim is to complete the strategy of dealing with problem
loans in the current financial year. Current levels of provisioning mean we
are on course to achieve that,' says Mr Kensuke Uchida, a senior manager.
But this view is almost certainly too optimistic, because the level of
problem loans disclosed by the banks under-represents the real total. The
banks' figures do not include restructured loans, on which interest rates
have been cut to keep borrowers solvent. They also exclude loans made to the
banks' housing affiliates, whose own prodigality in property-related lending
makes the banks look prudent. Industry estimates suggest that some of these
companies have problem loans equal to more than 60 per cent of their loan
book.
These factors lead observers to estimate that banks' real problem loans are
closer to Y30,000bn than the Y13,600bn officially disclosed. Some banks are
much better placed than others: problem loans at Mitsubishi Bank are
estimated at 3.6 per cent of total loans, while the figure for Hokkaido
Takushoku Bank is 7.4 per cent. But for the sector as a whole, estimated bad
loans represent nearly 6 per cent of the loan book, a figure that suggests
that, even without further shocks such as another sharp fall in the property
market, the backlog may take five years to clear.
The problem of poor lending would be less severe if the profitability of
Japanese banks were not among the lowest in the world. Moody's, the US
credit rating agency, estimates that banks' profits before provisions for
bad debts are less than 0.4 per cent of total assets, compared with 2.4 per
cent for US banks and 1.7 per cent for banks in the UK.
Worse still, contrary to the prevailing wisdom, the banks' low margins are
not the product of big overheads or overmanning. Operating expenses as a
percentage of risk assets are much lower for Japanese banks than for their
American counterparts.
The fundamental difficulty is weak revenue. Japanese loan spreads, the
difference between lending and borrowing rates, are razor-thin. Core
earnings (before taxes, credit expenses and securities gains), as a
proportion of average assets, range from zero to 0.8 per cent for Japanese
banks, against 2.5 per cent for US banks. As Moody's says: 'If Japanese
banks had the same level of core earnings as US banks, the asset quality
problem would be quite manageable, there would be no crisis, and Japanese
banks as a whole would be much more creditworthy.'
What is more alarming is that the slim margins are getting thinner. Interest
rates are now at or near the bottom of the business cycle, depriving banks
of the benefit of a time lag between cuts in lending rates and cuts in
deposit rates that has kept their margins from narrowing even further.
In any case, the fragile economy is cutting demand for bank lending and
banks are being forced to pare loan rates.
Financial deregulation is beginning to hit banks' profits, too. As limits on
interest rates are gradually removed, banks are having to compete harder for
funds in the retail market. And deregulation of the bond market is helping
companies that are borrowing to dispense with banks altogether in their
search for finance.
Yet banks seem unable to break out of the stranglehold of low profitability.
Despite the squeeze on margins, lending remains the core activity for banks,
which have little knowhow in developing new fee-earning business. Seventy
per cent of Japanese banks' profits derive from lending - far higher than in
US or European banks.
For now, banks will attempt to offset their falling profitability with gains
on sales of their large equity portfolios. But this is not a long-term
solution. Shareholding by banks counts as a part of their capital base and
selling equities diminishes their capital ratios which, under rules laid
down by the Bank for International Settlements, have to be kept above agreed
levels. Japanese banks are already close to the minimum.
More importantly, such emergency measures will not confront the heart of the
problem. With 21 main banks and more than 5,000 regional and other banks,
Japan has chronic financial overcapacity. As deregulation gathers pace, the
competition for depositors and loans will heat up, and banks and regulators
will face a choice between two unpalatable solutions.
Some banks could be allowed to fail, but this is unlikely given the
authorities' adherence to the stability of the banking system, and the
fragile state of confidence in it. Or there will have to be mergers, a
development said to be favoured by the regulators but fraught with
difficulties, as the relatively profitable banks will find the charms of the
weaker banks distinctly resistible.
But as long as regulators oppose failures and banks say no to mergers, the
much-needed rationalisation of the financial system will be shelved
indefinitely. The status quo can only mean further decline for all Japan's
banks. As a senior executive at one of the larger institutions puts it: 'The
problem with Japanese banks is that not many of them realise that they
weren't really competitive from the start. Now they have to face it: banking
here is a dwindling business.'

FT  28 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Major's soliloquy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The prime minister stood like Hamlet last night and proclaimed, in effect,
'T B or not T B: that is the question'. Tony Blair or not Tony Blair is the
topic of today's British political discourse. The new Labour leader has
pilfered some of the Conservatives' best thoughts, such as respect for the
family, toughness on crime, and a willingness to embrace a dynamic market
economy. He has added others, notably the notion that individuals benefit
from strengthening the community. Although not stated to be such, last
night's lecture to the European Policy Forum constituted Mr Major's
considered response to Mr Blair.
It was pedestrian. Mr Major recounted his government's record and listed its
policies. The theme was that Conservatives favour limited government. He did
not mention Mr Blair, who seeks to persuade us that more government would be
beneficial. Conservatives, Mr Major intimated, regarded economic growth as
an opportunity to reduce taxation. 'Others' (aka Blair) talked of using
growth to pay for their pledges. This meant 'expropriating the benefits of
growth from those who created it'. Mr Major will expand the 20 per cent
income tax band one day. A better way of helping low earners would be to
raise tax thresholds.
Hamlet differs in another important respect from the Prince of Denmark. Mr
Major rejects constitutional reform. Mr Blair promises an assembly for
Scotland, and the ejection of hereditary peers from the Lords. The Labour
leader would abolish the quango state, returning powers to elected
authorities; Mr Major would expand the network of appointed boards that has
sprung up since 1979. There is a genuine difference between those who regard
the proliferation of health service trusts, grant-maintained schools and the
like as decentralisation and those who regard the making of all these
appointments by the central government as an enhancement of undemocratic
central control. Since the finance is centralised, the Blair argument has
strength.
Somewhat petulantly, Mr Major reminded us that in the 1992 election campaign
he repeatedly spoke of a welfare state that gave a 'hand up' rather than a
'hand out'. That is precisely Mr Blair's policy today; maddeningly for the
prime minister, the leader of the opposition is the more famous for it. The
same might be said of the aspiration to expand nursery education, when
resources permit. This is a bipartisan slice of pie in the sky.
Mr Major recalled Conservative successes, such as privatisation, sales of
council houses, the Citizen's Charter, deregulation, and the drive to bring
private finance into public projects. All were originally opposed by Labour;
it is questionable whether any will be when the party is modernised by Mr
Blair. In truth there are distinct differences between the two principal
actors on the UK's political stage, but the audience may be forgiven for
mixing them up.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Bin those reports: Which institutions and practices could
quietly be disposed of? Andrew Jack suggests one
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They take years to complete, cost millions of pounds to research and rarely
lead to any significant action. Critics are increasingly questioning whether
the UK Department of Trade and Industry inspectors' examinations of
corporate failures are worth the trouble.
The latest example came last week when the DTI released its report into the
collapse of Atlantic Computers, the leasing company taken over by the
conglomerate British &amp; Commonwealth in 1988. Further DTI reports - including
on Guinness's 1986 takeover of Distillers - are in the pipeline. Though they
may make interesting reading, the minimal response to their suggestions is
unlikely to justify the efforts involved in their production.
Mr Hugh Willmott, of the University of Manchester Institute of Science and
Technology, who has studied DTI reports over the past 20 years, says they
have done little more than highlight the limitations of company regulation
in the UK. 'They offer apparent reassurance but delay closer scrutiny,' he
says.
What little comfort the reports offer the public comes at a high price. The
380-page Atlantic report cost Pounds 6.5m to produce in fees and expenses
paid to a barrister, an accountant and their assistants, making it the most
expensive ever commissioned.
Such expense might be worthwhile if the findings were definitive. But they
are not. The accountancy profession's own regulatory committees stress that
they need to carry out independent investigations for the sake of 'natural
justice' before taking any disciplinary action against accountants
criticised in DTI reports.
Nor are the reports of much use in commercial litigation. British &amp;
Commonwealth's administrators have launched legal action against auditors
and advisers to Atlantic. But their action is based on a separate
examination of the facts. In fact, the administrators began their legal
moves before the report was published.
The DTI itself may act on the recommendations of its inspectors and seek the
disqualification of directors censored in its reports - as seems likely in
the case of Atlantic and British &amp; Commonwealth. But the level of detail in
the reports is greater than usually required by the DTI when it seeks in the
courts the disqualification of directors.
The only other sanction the reports offer is the public embarrassment of
those mentioned. This is not always effective. For example, the late Mr
Robert Maxwell was subject to scathing criticism in reports on his companies
in the early 1970s, but it did not stop him from rebuilding his empire.
Another problem with most inspectors' reports is that they take too long to
produce. By the time the conclusions are reached, recommendations for reform
may be overdue or irrelevant. For instance, the two Atlantic inspectors took
more than four years to publish - a not untypical gap. So long after the
events in question, individuals and companies concerned may not be active or
even alive.
There is also inconsistency in the launching of investigations. Under
company and insolvency laws, the DTI can appoint inspectors to examine the
circumstances surrounding a collapse or instance of fraud and then compile a
report - some of which are made public. Such decisions appear arbitrary. No
inspectors have been appointed to examine three recent high-profile
collapses: Polly Peck International, the conglomerate built up by fugitive
businessman Mr Asil Nadir; the Bank of Credit and Commerce International; or
the Maxwell companies.
A large number of other inspectors' reports have been commissioned but never
made public. The DTI says it typically receives 1,000 requests for
investigations each year and pursues a quarter of these. Most remain
confidential - officially on grounds of public interest but adding to the
impression that reports are commissioned and released according to
ministers' whims. A handful is published each year.
Moreover, the impartiality of the reports can be questioned. Accountants and
lawyers are those who normally carry out the inquiries, yet they represent
two professions often criticised in the reports, and are even sometimes
drawn from firms that have themselves been criticised previously.
All this suggests that inspectors' reports are an expensive indulgence.
Though they are useful for academics and researchers, their price makes them
inaccessible to many students: the Atlantic report costs Pounds 35. It may
be time that the DTI reconsidered what purpose its reports serve and how it
could meet these needs more effectively.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Social Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The white paper on European social policy marks an important watershed in
the complex, and often rancorous, debate about the European social
dimension. Five years after the launch of the social charter and 18 months
after the arrival of the single market, the European Commission is at last
signalling a highly desirable period of consolidation.
The white paper will not convince the Euro-sceptics in the UK government of
the case for Europe-wide minimum standards. And some rather complacent
rhetoric about the superiority of the European model will, no doubt, cause
them great irritation. But that is not the point.
The European social dimension will not - and should not - disappear. But it
badly needs more restraint and more rigour. It is hard for a document
written by committee to provide such rigour, and this document has its fair
share of confusion.
Nonetheless, the underlying agenda of the white paper is a welcome departure
from the bombast of the past few years. It places a welcome emphasis on
subsidiarity. It openly acknowledges the dispute over labour market
regulation, and stresses taking stock rather than plunging on with more
legislation.
When it does call for action it is generally in sensible areas. It wants far
more work done to ensure that the directives which have been passed are
actually implemented. The UK can be proud of its record here. It also, like
the UK government, wants to make sure that the rules governing labour
mobility work better and, indeed, wants to extend them to cover things such
as occupational pensions.
This more cautious agenda is partly a reflection of the fact that there is
now a substantial body of legislation in place, mainly in the relatively
uncontroversial areas of mobility, health and safety, and equality between
men and women. It also reflects the fact that several member states, notably
Germany, do not want to allow a big regulatory gap to open up between the UK
 -with its Maastricht treaty 'opt-out' from some legislation - and the other
11 states. This must be regarded, at least by the UK government, as a
success for the opt-out policy.
It is true that the white paper does talk about possible future fields for
legislation. The mention of individual dismissals may well cause particular
anxiety to employers. But overall there is scarcely a single hard commitment
to new legislation in this document. The new image for Directorate-General
Five, the social affairs directorate, appears to be that of a think-tank
rather than of Europe's labour ministry. Indeed, the white paper explicitly
talks about the Commission acting as a clearing house for good ideas from
different countries or as a broker, able to 'pick and mix' best practice
from around the EU. Among other things, it might ask itself whether all
aspects of past regulation are sacrosanct.

   THE RESURGENCE OF CENTRAL ASIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Islam or Nationalism?
By Ahmed Rashid
Zed Books, London, New Jersey, and Oxford University Press, Karachi. Pounds

pages
On a bleak border post in Tajikistan, a clutch of Russian 'peacekeep-ers',
caught up in a civil war, was recently shot dead. The deaths went almost
unnoticed in the west, where most governments still look on Central Asia
much as Marco Polo did centuries earlier: exotic, dusty, far away and prone
to blood-letting.
But as the five ex-Soviet Central Asian states grapple with their new
independence, violent events are starting to alarm outsiders. Russia has
stepped up its demands for western approval for its role as 'peacekeeper' in
the area.
So where is this turbulent region heading? The answer to that question has
consequences not only for Russia and for Central Asia's neighbours, such as
Iran, but also for the west.
The diagnosis in Ahmed Rashid's book, which provides the general reader with
the first readable, thorough account of the region, is not entirely
encouraging.
The collapse of the Soviet Union has tipped Central Asia into economic
decline. But in contrast to other regions, the Central Asians have only a
minimal sense of national identity. None of the five states of Turkmenistan,
Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan or Uzbekistan demanded independence, but
they were tipped into it by the Soviet collapse. With powerful neighbours
vying for influence in the region, the states' new-found freedom has left
some of their governments looking distinctly dazed.
Faced with this uncertainty, the focus of the west has been on two bogeymen.
One is Islamic fundamentalism, which alarmists mutter could radicalise these
Moslem republics as they shrug off their communist past. The second is
nationalism, which, it is feared, could lead to inter-ethnic conflicts in an
area of rising populations and scarce land and water.
The strength of Rashid's book is that it challenges both of these familiar
bogeymen. Nationalism, he points out, is not a good way to understand a
region that has historically been dominated by a shifting patchwork of
tribes and kingdoms. Central Asia's leaders are trying to create states
based on boundaries arbitrarily carved out by Stalin, so national identities
remain unstable.
This point is worth stressing. As nationalism replaces communism as the
west's favourite demon, it is often forgotten that nationalism does not
operate the same way in all the east European and ex-Soviet 'nations'. Many
Central Asians still see their first loyalty as being towards a clan or
particular region - and only second towards a nation. Consequently, there is
as much conflict and rivalry within these nations as between them.
The advantage of this is that none of the simmering rivalries in the region
has yet created a full-blown conflict between republics. Its drawback,
however, is that it leaves Central Asians facing a post-colonial identity
crisis. And in an area where most of the population adheres to Islam, the
question is: could fundamentalism emerge to fill the void?
Rashid's approach towards this second bogeyman is insightful, partly as a
result of his background as a Pakistani journalist who has worked for
western newspapers. He combines the political perspective of an outsider
with sensitivity towards Moslem culture.
Islam, Rashid acknowledges, has enjoyed a renaissance in Central Asia since
independence. But this does not mean that the region is uniting around a
single revolutionary flag. 'Radical' Islamic movements have emerged in some
of the rural valleys of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. But the more mystical -
and tolerant - strand of 'sufi' Islam is also playing a key role in the
revival. Meanwhile, Central Asia's governments remain secular in their
outlook.
Fundamentalism could, Rashid acknowledges, gain more supporters if the
economy deteriorates. Republics have come to independence with little
industry and few transport links. Most of the regimes remain authoritarian.
And though Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan have made some steps towards the market
economy, reform has barely begun in Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Meanwhile, outside aid has been minimal. Though foreign companies vie for
Kazakhstan's oil reserves, Turkmenistan's gas and Uzbekistan's tobacco and
cotton, most western investors remain nervous.
But if Central Asian governments begin to embrace political and economic
change, decline might be reversed, particularly in the resource-rich
republics of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, Rashid concludes. The region is
blessed with a literate population, a culture which is not averse to the
market, and reserves of oil, gas, gold and cotton.
But if Central Asian governments cannot - or will not - act, then a cocktail
of social pressures and worsening economic conditions could create grinding
instability, particularly in the poorer rural areas of Uzbekistan and
Tajikistan.
This second scenario would, as Rashid points out, be a tragedy for Central
Asia. What perhaps he fails to stress sufficiently is that it would also be
of concern to its neighbours. Large Russian populations live in Central
Asia, and Russia retains tens of thousands of troops in the region,
ostensibly to promote 'stability'.
So far the soldiers have succeeded in bringing a lull in Tajikistan's civil
war, by effectively propping up the authoritarian government. But Russia has
little inclination to become involved in a second Afghan-style conflict,
irrespective of whether the west would tolerate such an engagement. And
though the 'Afghanistan' scenario is remote, the possibility that an
unstable Russia could be faced with further turmoil on its southern flank is
reason for the west to keep watching Central Asia - and to welcome Rashid's
well-written account.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Analysis sets back understanding of
growth in unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Professor E S PHELPS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I have carefully argued that the steep rise in the 'tax wedge' between
the employer's labour cost per worker and the employee's after-tax wage is a
major source of the climb in the natural rate of unemployment in western
economies over the 1970s and 1980s, especially in continental Europe where
this rise was generally steepest. Alas, the acute analysis by Samuel Brittan
(' 'Wedge' versus 'social wage' ', July 21) will be seen by many readers as
refuting that contention, and thus setting back markedly our understanding
of the secular elevation of unemployment.
He is right that popular expositions fail to clarify why the hated payroll
tax is damaging for the natural rate, and likewise personal income tax,
while the admired VAT is not. Right, too, about the necessity to leave room
for other factors. But wrong to reason that, since the popular treatments
are inadequate, there can be nothing in the idea.
The whole difficulty stems from the unfortunate premise in popular
treatments - a crude version of real wage rigidity: nothing will induce
workers to accept a reduced real wage at a given unemployment rate. (Only an
increase of unemployment can wring a cut in the real wage.)
'If workers have the market power to make employers recoup in higher pay the
burden of payroll taxes, they also have the power to recoup other taxes
levied directly on their incomes or expenditures', says Samuel Brittan. On
this premise, it is true that a shift from payroll taxes to VAT would not
lower the natural rate. The workers would require the same net wage from
companies, and the government the same tax, so the unemployment rate would
not be affected.
The contrasting premise of my Structural Slumps (Harvard, February 1994) is
that the real wage required at a given unemployment rate to mollify the
workers - to keep at cost-effective levels their propensities to quit, shirk
and strike - is a function of the non-wage resources the workers can fall
back on: the real income from their private wealth and from their so-called
social capital consisting of welfare entitlements and ties to family and
friends.
On this improved premise, the theory implies that value-added taxation,
unaccompanied by exemptions, is theoretically neutral for the natural rate.
It lowers the real value of workers' non-wage incomes as much as it lowers
the real value of the wage their employer can afford to pay them. As a
result, the real wage required for cost-effective worker performance falls,
and by enough to accommodate the reduced real wage that employers can
afford.
The trouble with the payroll tax is that, since it does not reduce workers'
real non-wage resources, it does nothing to reduce the real wage required
for cost-effective worker performance. Thus the reduction caused in the wage
that companies can afford to pay is not accommodated by a real-wage cut. An
increase in the natural unemployment rate is the result.
All of this is supported by the econometric findings.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The inflationary rises in construction pay you reported on July 22
('Shortages push construction pay 'above 1980s level' ') are an alarming but
predictable result of the short-termism that has bedevilled the industry for
many years.
The RICS quarterly construction survey to be released this week will show
that more than 50 per cent of respondents expect to encounter skills
shortages in the next three months.
We do not advocate a return to the total planning that suffocates
initiative. But it must be clear that only long-term commitment by
government and the institutions will allow contractors and professional
firms to build teams and nurture essential skills. To have to shed staff
just as they are about to realise their potential is soul-destroying at a
human level and a tragic waste of investment in any industry.
In a sector as important as construction, it threatens the price stability
which has been so hard won.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report into the supply of new
cars was indeed slow ('Monopoly panel rapped as toothless', July 26), but it
was very thorough. It cost the UK motor industry millions of pounds to
supply the MMC with the information it sought. The evidence enabled the MMC
to conclude, with authority, that the motor industry was not abusing its
market power or operating against the public interest.
Surely a large, highly complex industry employing three-quarters of a
million people requires thorough consideration by an independent panel of
experts if massive damage to Britain's industrial structure is to be
avoided. This must be better than precipitate action by other bodies, like
the Consumers' Association, which appear to have already made up their minds
before they start an investigation.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Professor K ALEC CHRYSTAL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Peter Norman (Economics Notebook, July 25 ) stated that '. . . a
general SDR increase would benefit wealthy industrialised countries more
than the disadvantaged'. If this were true, the wealthy countries would
surely have been more positively inclined towards issues of special drawing
rights. In reality, it is false, notwithstanding the fact that allocations
in proportion to quota allocate more SDRs to the wealthier nations.
The mistake lies in a misunderstanding of what SDRs are. A newly allocated
SDR is not a gift of money, rather it is the gift of a right to borrow
money. The rate charged on such borrowings is a weighted average of money
market rates in the five currencies that compose the SDR. The largest OECD
governments can already borrow on the finest terms, so giving them extra
rights to do so gives them nothing.
Poorer countries cannot borrow on the finest terms, so it is the margin
between what they would be charged and the SDR interest rate (times their
SDR allocation) which is the size of their gain. In effect, the extra risk
is spread throughout the international community, though there may be a net
welfare gain from risk pooling.
The error has been committed, since the invention of SDRs, to include SDR
allocations in official reserves. We do not count unused credit lines in the
money stock. Reserves should include only holdings of the SDR in excess of
allocation. In short, the issue of SDR allocations should be seen as the
allocation of a borrowing line at prime rates, rather than as a gift of new
money.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Economic Viewpoint: No going back to Bretton Woods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bretton Woods system, which was established 50 years ago this summer,
and which broke down after President Nixon floated the dollar in the early
1970s, has often been described as a fixed exchange rate system.
The description is a caricature of the intentions of the founding fathers.
The latter were, above all, determined to avert the disruptive forces which
destroyed an open world economy between the wars. On the monetary side they
saw these as being competitive devaluations and countries being forced to
adopt excessively deflationary domestic policies by the need to defend fixed
exchange rates.
For this reason they devised a system of 'par values' which were meant to be
fixed but adjustable. The following devices were meant to guard against both
competitive devaluations and deflationary pressures:
An ample supply of credit for countries in balance of payments difficulties.
The ability, and indeed the requirement, to adjust parities in the face of a
fundamental disequilibrium.
Equal obligation on surplus countries to adjust. A 'scarce currency' clause
allowed members to discriminate against a surplus country which refused to
conform.
(Often forgotten) Capital controls were accepted as an integral part of the
system.
Member countries had to keep their currencies within a narrow range against
the dollar. But the US itself was obliged to convert dollars into gold at
the unrealistic prewar price of Dollars 35 per ounce to legitimate monetary
authorities.
All these elements broke down. IMF credit was not as large as Keynes
intended, and his hoped-for international unit, 'bancor', was never
established. But for most of the postwar decades the problem proved to be
inflation rather than deflation; and the much-discussed shortage of
international liquidity (which meant roughly official reserves plus
borrowing ability) proved a myth. Capital controls leaked well before free
market fashions led to their abolition.
'Fixed but adjustable' exchange rates proved a chimera, because, if any
government professed other than an undying attachment to its parity, its
currency was overwhelmed by speculative flows. With the freeing of capital
movements, the current account was no longer the only influence on a
currency's international value.
In its last few years, Bretton Woods became frozen into a system of
'reluctant adjustment'. Countries held their parities against the US dollar
as long as possible, a leading example being Harold Wilson's stubborn
defence of the sterling parity between 1964 and 1967. The end of Bretton
Woods was triggered by the inflationary financing of the Vietnam war, which
made countries increasingly reluctant to hold their reserves in dollars.
Since then the main international currencies have been floating against each
other. How well has floating worked? Enthusiasts on both sides have been
discomfited. We forget how many establishment figures solemnly told us that
floating rates could not work. On the other hand all those economic
theorists who expected easy and gradual adjustments have proved equally
mistaken. Nor have countries gained freedom to run domestic monetary
policies exactly as they liked. Governments have indeed had the option of
running inflationary monetary policies and sinking exchange rates; but
holders of their currencies have eventually demanded an interest rate
premium for doing so. Countries have been able to have lower real interest
rates than their trading partners only in temporary and exceptional
circumstances.
The material assembled by the independent Bretton Woods commission, chaired
by Paul Volcker, has shown floating to have been anything but a smooth ride.
The volatility of the D-Mark-dollar exchange rate, judged by the monthly
percentage change, has quite often been near 10 per cent and has rarely been
very low.
Business can probably learn to live with short-term volatility. More
worrying have been the medium-term swings shown in the chart on this page.
In the mid-1980s there was a sharp boom in the dollar which took its value
to 50 per cent above anything that could be justified by inflation
differentials. The yen has since not only drifted upwards but shown large
medium-term swings and is now even more ridiculously overvalued than the
dollar was in 1985.
Have these fluctuations held back real activity? The Bretton Woods
Commission has yet another chart showing how average growth rates in the
Group of Seven main industrial countries declined from nearly 5 per cent a
year before 1973 to 2 1/2 per cent in the following decades. It also shows a
jump in fiscal deficits and a decline in total savings and investment. But
it would be a brave soul who could confidently attribute these changes to
floating exchange rates.
The first decade and a half of floating was also associated with near
double-digit inflation in the main industrial countries. In the past few
years, however, inflation has subsided to the levels of the early 1960s.
What has become clear, however, is that convergence on low inflation rates
is insufficient to produce stable exchange rates.
The biggest intellectual change since the old battles between fixed and
floating rates has been a loss of belief in the ability of inflationary
policies to stimulate an economy. Depreciation, if long continued, is only a
way of accommodating higher inflation than partner countries and is
ultimately self-defeating. There has also been a loosening of the perceived
link between exchange rates and current balance of payments surpluses or
deficits. If they are a problem - which they may not be - these imbalances
reflect gaps between domestic savings and investment which can be tackled,
if at all, only through fiscal policy.
Why not then abandon the attempt to seize fleeting advantages from temporary
depreciation or appreciation for the benefit of predictable locked-in
exchange rates or even a world currency? This, after all, happens inside the
US, where in exchange for the benefits of a common dollar, states such as
Texas or California have to accept a Federal Reserve monetary policy
relating to average US conditions.
Central bankers blame fiscal deficits both for exchange rate volatility
under floating rates and for the difficulty of making an early start on a
new fixed system such as European economic and monetary union (Emu).
Mainstream economists also say that there are no tax and transfer mechanisms
among the G7 or even the European Union on a scale corresponding to the US
tax and social security system. But there was no such transfer mechanism
even under the pre-1914 gold standard.
Recent attempts to establish target exchange rate zones in the 1980s or
narrow bands in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) have basically failed
because of the absence of a linked monetary policy. Can there be such a
policy in the absence of a single government? The experience of the gold
standard suggests that there can be.
The proposed European central bank, if and when it gets off the ground,
should be an instructive pilot project. Meanwhile, the accident of the earth
having turned round the sun 50 times since Bretton Woods will not bring a
systemic change any nearer. For the time being the comment of Ernest Stern,
managing director of the World Bank, about what is likely to follow the 50th
anniversary of Bretton Woods is the wisest available guide. He simply said:
'Well, the 51st anniversary.'

FT  28 JUL 94 / Arts: Where opera goes from strength to strength - Andrew
Clark reviews 'Francesca da Rimini' at the increasingly popular Bregenz
festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A glance across Europe's burgeoning festival landscape suggests that few
have a more consistent record of success in recent years than Bregenz. While
other festivals struggle to create or maintain their market niche, Bregenz
has quietly gone from strength to strength.
It has made an asset of its geographical setting, drawing audiences from
three countries around the Austrian corner of Lake Constance, and using the
lake as a natural backdrop for performances on the floating stage. More than
200,000 people have bought tickets this summer, and for many it will be
their first experience of opera.
Bregenz also proves that an open-air spectacle does not exclude artistic
seriousness: it is guaranteed by the David Pountney - Stefanos Lazaridis
production of Nabucco, which has returned for a second year with casts
including Sergei Leiferkus and Rosalind Plowright.
To balance the popular fare outside, Bregenz chooses a rarity for
performance indoors in the comfortable 1700-seat Festspielhaus. Catalani's
La Wally and Tchaikovsky's Mazeppa have been staged in recent years (and
praised on this page). This year's choice was Zandonai's Francesca da
Rimini. Next year Harry Kupfer will direct a Russian cast in
Rimsky-Korsakov's Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh, while Pountney and
Lazaridis return for Fidelio on the floating stage.
Bregenz owes its international reputation to a shrewd balancing of
commercial and artistic priorities - largely the achievement of the current
director, Alfred Wopmann. When he took over ten years ago, the festival
attracted less than a third of the patrons it has today. Founded in 1946, it
had survived on a diet of operetta fed to a predominantly local audience.
Wopmann put the festival on a more independent financial footing, improved
technical and rehearsal facilities, and upgraded the quality of performance.
As a former violinist in the Vienna Philharmonic, who later built a
successful career as a stage director, he knew exactly what he was doing.
Jerome Savary's production of Die Zauberflote in 1985 was the turning point.
Box office jumped 25 per cent, and has continued to rise. State subsidy has
also grown, but its proportion of the budget has dropped from 68 per cent to
33 per cent. Thanks to the festival, money is pouring into the region and
the local authorities are investing Sch220m (Pounds 14m) in a new
multi-purpose hall on the festival site, a useful insurance against
inclement weather during rehearsals and an additional year-round performing
space.
Wopmann, 57, has never courted controversy as a way of generating publicity.
He avoids prima donnas. With 6,000 seats to fill each night on the floating
stage, he says he cannot afford to be highbrow. 'I'm not interested in a
production with footnotes - the kind where the director needs to explain his
intentions in the programme book. I'm a believer in Kunst fur alle - art for
all. That does not mean we only deal in superficial entertainment. You have
all the naturalism you need in the background setting here. On stage we want
artists and public to draw the link with their inner nature.'
He says he tries to choose directors for their ability to define the nucleus
of a work, and to bring out its relevance for today. 'Opera needs a lot of
head, but ultimately it makes its impact through the emotions. When all the
different components come together in the right way, when the artists give
their all, the work shines alone and the audience identifies with the
characters on stage. These are the moments when you can say art changes the
world.'
The Bregenz production of Francesca da Rimini may not have changed the world
this summer, but it has certainly altered perceptions about a work which has
traditionally been viewed with a degree of condescension. Based on
D'Annunzio's cruel fin-de-siecle love story and premiered in Turin in 1914,
Francesca is verismo distilled through a spectrum of late Romantic
influences. That it emerged as a seamless whole in Bregenz is a tribute to
the unified approach of the production team. The young Italian conductor
Fabio Luisi drew all the rich Mediterranean atmosphere from Zandonai's
instrumental palette, making it sound refined and clear-cut rather than
mushy. Climaxes never descended into crude orchestral rhetoric, and there
was a strong sense of forward momentum.
The sultry warmth of the instrumental colouring was reflected in Antony
McDonald's decor and costumes - a seductively beautiful match of sight and
sound, preserving the medieval setting in clean lines, haunting shades of
pink and turquoise, and a sense of evening sun. Despite Wolfgang Gobbel's
superb lighting, the Act 2 battle was a disappointment: the chorus hung
around like supernumeries, and the scene ended with a risible attempt at
'contemporary relevance' - a modern high-rise block going up in flames.
Robert Fortune's stage direction was otherwise a model of discretion.
Francesca was sung by the Bulgarian soprano Elena Filipova. Her voice is not
big, but the timbre is rich and clear, and she never forces. Young and
beautiful, she looked the part. She was partnered by Frederic Kalt, an
American whose physical stature and lustrous tenor made him an ideal Paolo.
Philippe Rouillon captured both the ugliness and the humanity of Francesca's
lame husband Giancotto, while Kenneth Riegel was in excellent form as the
one-eyed ogre Malatestino. All Francesca's ladies-in-waiting deserved their
solo bows, especially Lorena Espina, the sensuous slave girl.
A footnote for visitors: Bregenz itself is not very prepossessing. Instead
of staying in an expensive lakeside hotel, try one of the charming villages
in the surrounding region (I stayed at Horbranz), where the inns are quiet
and welcoming, and Bregenz is still only a few minutes away by car.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Arts: Eyes on the teen market - Cinema

<TEXT>
NORTH (PG) Rob Reiner
THE SANDLOT KIDS (PG) David Mickey Evans
PARIS, FRANCE (18) Gerard Ciccoritti
BOILING POINT (18) Takeshi Kitano
NECRONOMICON (18) Brian Yuzna, Christophe Gans, Shu Kaneko
WOODSTOCK (18) Michael Wadleigh
The concept behind North is one of the more promising to inform a screen
comedy this year. In it, a 13-year-old boy with the unlikely first name of
North decides that his parents do not love him enough, especially since he
regularly cleans his room and always gets perfect grades at school. So he
does what any red-blooded American would do - he hires a lawyer, who starts
divorce proceedings against the folks. North wins the case and is given
three months to find a new family who will love him for his true worth. If
he fails, he must go back home or, worse, to an orphanage.
It is not hard to imagine what Frank Capra would have done with this
material, a notion enhanced by the presence of a Frank Capra III as the
first assistant director. But the direction of the usually reliable Rob
Reiner fails to take advantage of the film's satirical possibilities,
playing instead for the broadest possible laughs and most sugary emotions.
North's parental suitors are little more than daft caricatures of mega-rich
Texans, tourism-crazed Hawaiians and creepily holistic Eskimos. As North,
Elijah Wood is resolutely bland, while usually hilarious performers like
Jason Alexander and Jon Lovitz labour beneath a script that never takes its
eyes off the teen market. Bruce Willis's lugubrious presence as North's
mentor only shows that the film's makers had more money than sense.
The Sandlot Kids is another willowy hymn to American boyhood. In it, Tom
Guiry plays a 12-year-old who passes the summer of 1962 playing baseball
with his friends. Their idyll is menaced only by the existence of the
world's baddest dog beyond the sandlot's fence. When a prized ball falls
into the hound's clutches, Guiry and company are forced to try to get it
back, making for one of the more bizarre rites-of-passage movies to come
along in quite a while.
David Mickey Evans's film is a largely amiable affair, coming unglued only
at the end with a prolonged chase sequence. There is a genuinely funny
moment where the boys try chewing tobacco for the first time, though the
movie loses its claim to be an accurate slice of Americana when it has an
ageing black baseballer (James Earl Jones) reminiscing about his days
playing with Babe Ruth. The viciously racist colour line that kept blacks
out of the big leagues was not broken until several years after Ruth's
death.
Paris, France bills itself as erotically charged, though nowhere is there
any mention of the fact that its abundant energy is all negative. Its
central character, Lucy (Leslie Hope), is a Canadian fiction writer who
suffers a serious block as she tries to write about an affair she had in
Paris with a now-dead poet. Her creative occlusion is finally purged when
her publisher husband introduces her to Sloan (Peter Outerbridge), a hunky
boxer-turned-writer. They immediately embark on a torrid affair that
includes sodomy, straight razors, leather chaps and, worst of all, lots of
bad prose. The film ends with Lucy, her husband and Sloan together in bed,
all three being chastised over the phone by Sloan's gay lover.
If this strenuous bedsmanship were cast as a black comedy it might have
worked, but wit and laughter is rare in a film which takes itself as
seriously as a heart attack. Director Gerard Ciccoritti seems to have
intended a sort of 'Last Tango in Toronto' in which tortured sex mirrors
tortured souls. Unfortunately, the film is unable to transform the lustful
into the lyrical, making for a nasty and jarringly pretentious affair.
Despite the lurid couplings and ribald language, there is a strange
puritanism lurking at the film's heart, a sense that sex can be either nasty
or liberating - but never a joy in itself.
Despite being the most popular filmmaker in Japan, 'Beat' Takeshi Kitano has
yet to make a big impact in the English-speaking market. With his latest
effort, Boiling Point, it is easy to see why. To put it mildly, his
sensibility takes considerable getting used to. This story of a
wimp-turned-avenging angel is a curious blend of surrealism, black comedy
and sudden violence. The best thing about it is Takeshi's ability to keep
the audience off balance, though many viewers will find his uneven pacing
and unresolved misogyny as hard to swallow as week-old sushi.
Another film that has cult written all over it is Necronomicon. Based on
three short stories by the horror writer HP Lovecraft, it bypasses the
normal conventions of plot and character to go comprehensively over the top
at every possible occasion. Slime-spewing orifices, flesh-chomping zombies
and globules of dripping flesh litter the film, punctuated by dialogue of
the 'I have a strong feeling we won't be seeing him anymore' variety. Fans
of Re-Animator and The Evil Dead might find something of value here, though
the squeamish would be advised to steer well clear.
Hippy-bashing has long been a popular sport, though watching the expanded
cut of Michael Wadleigh's seminal Woodstock makes you wonder if the flower
children might not have been on to something, after all. Sure, the Aquarian
speeches of the likes of John Sebastian and Joan Baez sound like self-parody
to modern ears. The public address announcements, meanwhile, are
inadvertently hilarious, particularly the continuous updates on the quality
of the LSD circulating through the audience.
But there is no denying the spirit of peaceful adventure at the heart of the
whole mad undertaking; a lack of malevolence, angst and irony that seems
positively Edenic a quarter century on. The music, remixed and cleaned up,
sounds great, particularly the rousing festival opener by Richie Havens, the
crooning melodies of Crosby, Stills and Nash, and the lyrical acid rock of
Jimi Hendrix. Viewers should be warned that the expanded director's cut is
now nearly four hours long, but those ready to take the plunge should
thoroughly enjoy this grandaddy of rock documentaries.

Here's a plot for a blockbuster novel: under the sea off the Norwegian coast
lies a graveyard for Russian nuclear submarines. The official view is that
they are safe, but the fear is that they are leaking radioactive
contamination that could destroy the world. According to True Stories
(Channel 4 at 9.30) this is exactly what is happening. Only now are the
stories of the disasters which have befallen the Soviet fleet of nuclear
submarines coming to light. They are believed to have claimed the lives of
more than 200 men, hence the title, The Widow Makers.
A bogeywoman who ended her career a much loved superstar features in Martina
 -Farewell to a Champion (BBC 1 at 10). The life of the tennis ace Martina
Navratilova is traced from childhood in Prague to emotional exit from
Wimbledon this summer as beaten finalist.
The Proms get a TV screening tonight (BBC 2 at 7.30), thanks to the
appearance of the dynamic Simon Rattle and his City of Birmingham Symphony
Orchestra. The programme ranges from Sibelius to Debussy and includes a new
work by Mark-Anthony Turnage.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Arts: Back to new music - BBC Proms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC has a proud tradition of encouraging new music in Britain. However
noble, this is work for which it is difficult to get recognition and the
opportunity afforded by the 100th season of the Promenade Concerts is
predictably one that the BBC has seized with alacrity.
Under the general theme of looking back, this year's programme incorporates
a selection of past BBC Proms' commissions. There is no point in being
sentimental about this. Many - possibly most - are heard once and never
again. Even a Maecenas as bountiful and well-informed as the BBC only
strikes lucky occasionally in the difficult world of contemporary classical
music.
Ostensibly, the Proms' director has selected the half dozen or so works
being revived this year, but in reality the sifting process has already
taken place over the years. On Monday and Tuesday we heard again two of
those which have found life for themselves beyond their first performances -
each surviving through some popular appeal, though of different kinds.
Monday's choice was Nicholas Maw's Scenes and Arias. Written in 1962,
revised four years later, it now has five Proms' outings to its credit. Its
attraction is a sultry, sun-soaked romanticism, which involves orchestral
textures so dense as almost to engulf the three female singers (here the
splendid trio of Elizabeth Woollett, Susan Bickley and Jean Rigby). Although
one can trace a descendency from Mahler to Tippett, Maw established a voice
of his own in this score. All it lacks is variety: one gets sated by so much
generalised richness before the half-hour is up.
On Tuesday, James MacMillan's The Confession of Isobel Gowdie (first
performed in 1990) lasted the same length of time, but felt much shorter.
The canny Scottish composer dramatises his material strongly and provides
unmissable markers so that the audience knows where it is within the piece.
Stravinsky is the main influence here, especially The Rite of Spring, but
there is a drive in the music which cannot come just from emulation. As a
single, near 30-minute movement, it is an impressive achievement and the BBC
Scottish Symphony Orchestra under Jerzy Maksymiuk made an exciting job of
it.
Each of the concerts also included a piano concerto. Monday's Prom had Mark
Elder and the BBC Symphony Orchestra providing a spruce accompaniment for
Mitsuko Uchida in Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto, but their tidiness
remained prosaic, where hers became elfin-light precision. The next night
Kathryn Stott was the soloist in a demure performance of Rakhmaninov's Third
Piano Concerto, which made up in detail and musicianship what it lacked in
animal red-bloodedness. One point to her credit: she played the big cadenza
in the first movement with more right notes than I have heard before.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Technology: Salesforce put on the record - Computers changed
the way Sun Alliance International staff use information / Software at Work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Salespeople are hard-working, self-motivated, gregarious and creative rather
than disciplined, according to the stereotype. It follows that the typical
salesperson dislikes the idea of a computerised Big Brother sales and
marketing system, and would hate to record in detail every call and action.
Nor would he enjoy the discipline of working from home.
Not so, according to Sun Alliance International, which now has two years'
experience of its sales and marketing system, known as Adam - Agency
Development and Management. In the past weeks, Adam has been rolled out to
the entire 170-strong salesforce, having started with 26 home workers, known
as OTRs - On The Road sales staff.
Although the idea of a PC-based sales system had germinated in SAI in the
late 1980s, the prompt to develop Adam was an economy drive that closed 20
regional offices, and left 26 salespeople 'rootless'.
According to Peter Burrows, manager of the marketing and sales department at
SAI, there was a strong drive to cut expenses in 1991. 'We had a working
party to examine the way we did business. What we found was a cumbersome
organisational structure that had to be adjusted.'
Sun Alliance International is a commercial insurance company, responsible
for professional indemnity, shipping, or any insurance required by a
company. Its parent Sun Alliance was founded in London in 1710, and now
comprises four operating companies focused on overseas, life, UK, and
international business.
Much of SAI's business comes to the UK from international customers. More
than 80 per cent of its business comes from a network of agents, supported
by a salesforce of 140 across the UK. Their job is a long-term one of
building relationships with the brokers and other intermediaries (agencies).
An analysis of the business written in various small offices, such as
Carlisle and Lincoln, showed that SAI could not justify the overheads. SAI
kept its 10 regional centres in cities such as Glasgow, Leeds and Manchester
but closed the smaller offices, and pulled out of premises shared with other
Sun Alliance operations.
The office closures gave SAI a timely opportunity to introduce computerised
support for its sales staff. Paper-based systems were sketchy. 'The sales
executive's natural instinct is not to complete records. Too often the
paperwork would be incomplete, or didn't tell the whole story,' says
Burrows.
The mainframe will always be needed at SAI to store policy records but a
PC-based system was more appropriate to people whose job means they are
often on the road. For the 26 staff who suddenly had no office, the system
had to make it easy to communicate and share information, and also had to be
easy to monitor.
Other requirements included managing large volumes of data, connecting
easily with the mainframe and allowing easy updates.
John Gimson, a marketing and sales manager responsible for the Adam
development and implementation, looked at dozens of demonstrations. He found
that few met the technical specification, and made a daring choice.
Adam is an in-house adaptation of a sales system called Oxygen, developed by
Integrated Sales Systems of London. At the time, ISS was new and had no
comparable customers. SAI turned this to its advantage, working closely with
ISS to evolve Oxygen into Adam within the seven-month deadline. Three years
later, the contract has been worth Pounds 450,000 to ISS for software and
consultancy.
Oxygen differed from other sales packages in that it was developed from the
view of field-based sales staff who need to share data with office-based
colleagues. Although based on the Sybase database, widely used as a core
system for building applications, ISS had built its own distributed database
facilities which enable it to be adapted to large organisations with complex
data distribution. Customer information is accessible by anyone: all view
the same record, synchronised in an overnight update.
According to Burrows: 'The beauty of a distributed database is that you can
share the information across a wide range of people. Gone are the days of
relying on a dusty set of papers in someone's car 100 miles away. Adam
forces a discipline on people using the system: plan, action, monitor.'
A series of workshops, training and planning meetings meant that the project
evolved as needs became apparent. 'It was a constant learning process,' says
Gimson. 'The sad thing is that, because they are nomadic, the sales person
is the one most remote from changes in office technology such as the fax or
the photocopier.'
A large database of 4,000 agencies and 140 salespeople brought some
technical problems. New methods, such as doing mass updates by modem, had to
be tried out. 'We worked it through,' says Gimson. 'We believed in the
system enough to resolve them en route. It was a three-way partnership - us,
ISS, the IT department. If you don't get IT and users working together you
will never get a working system.'
Steve Ginn, the sales development manager based in East Anglia, is one of
the users whose working pattern has changed. He has been using his Toshiba
T1900 laptop since December: 'It has been a process of trial and error,
exploring the 'safe play area' of replicated data. The system is
functionally very rich.'
His menu shows a task organiser, in-tray, electronic mail and standard user
reports and inquiries. 'I had no idea about computers, none at home. Any
approach to 'the computer' was made through others. We could all see the
quality this offered straight away.'
When Ginn trained, the emphasis was on sales techniques, not management. 'In
17 years with SAI, I have had various paper systems such as the Agency
Record Book, but it was difficult to analyse the information. This has given
me a far more structured approach, with full analysis and summaries - you
couldn't do that with a card index.'
He can analyse work on current campaigns and see instantly how long it is
since he contacted clients. Currently seconded elsewhere for three months,
Ginn has used Adam to append notes to the agency records for his account
'care-takers'.
SAI's three-year budget for the project of Pounds 200,000 a year has been
financed from the savings made by closing offices. Every user now has a PC
containing the Adam database. Some were implemented on existing PCs, but SAI
had to spend around Pounds 250,000 on 100 laptops, 80 modems and the central
server.
There have already been two hardware upgrades: one to an IBM RS/6000,
another to 486-based laptops with faster communications. The initial
software cost Pounds 270,000, but has been upgraded twice with Pounds 50,000
worth of extensions to store further marketing information, including
industry coding for market sectors.
'One of the fundamentals of selling is an understanding of the customers'
needs,' says Ginn. 'Once we know the customer sectors, we can start working
more closely in partnership with brokers: the customer sees a far more
professional approach.'
Because of the office closures, SAI was not in a position to pick and choose
the subjects of its first pilot scheme in April 1992. Now, two years later,
and a few weeks after rolling out its system to the rest of its 170 staff,
Gimson and Burrows see it as an advantage that it could not hand pick its
guinea pigs.
The challenge of winning round disaffected staff was invaluable in preparing
them for the wider challenge to come. They trained total novices on the
keyboard, and worked to put at rest the fears of those who felt they were
'expelled' from the cosy support of their office. The system has had its
success stories: one user whose performance once gave cause for concern has
become a home-worker and an enthusiastic and effective Adam user.
'You've got to open people's eyes to what the technology can do for them,
and you can't do that overnight,' says Burrows. 'The vast majority, now they
have seen it in action, see myriad advantages. Adam converts task response
into customer care, and that is what the technology can help us do.'

FT  28 JUL 94 / Technology: Cowpeas playing part in Aids fight - Deborah
Hargreaves on a novel approach to genetic engineering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bathed in artificial light in a sealed room at the headquarters of Axis
Genetics near Cambridge in the UK, several humble cowpea plants are making
their contribution to the search for an Aids vaccine.
The plants are infected with a common cowpea virus, but to that virus
scientists have attached proteins containing parts of HIV, the virus
believed to cause Aids.
This virus-protein combination will later be injected into mice to see if
they produce antibodies to the virus. If this is successful, clinical trials
of the resulting vaccine could begin on humans as early as next year.
Axis Genetics is the hi-tech arm of Agricultural Genetics, a biotechnology
company which hopes to come to the UK stock market next year. 'In some ways,
this is really whacky science - there are so many different applications,'
says Iain Cubitt, Axis's managing director, of the plant viruses.
Other vaccines Axis is 'growing' in this way include a medicine for foot and
mouth disease and one for mastitis in cattle. The foot and mouth disease
treatment is currently being tested on guinea pigs with cat-
tle trials due to start next
year.
'We've chosen applications where a huge amount is known about the viruses
already and where we can grow different proteins on the plant,' Cubitt says.
The benefit of producing vaccines in this way is that the resulting
treatments are very stable and do not need to be refrigerated.
This gives them a long shelf-life making it easier to transport them to
remote places. Since one leaf can produce hundreds of doses, large amounts
of vaccines can be grown in quite a small, enclosed area.
One of the biggest problems facing the company is the lack of public
sympathy for genetic engineering. Cubitt stresses that public fears about a
'rogue' virus escaping from field trials are misplaced.
'This whole room could produce 1bn doses of HIV vaccine,' he says of the
small laboratory where the cowpea plants are growing. 'There will never be
any need to grow them in the field.'
In addition, the production process is simple: the leaves are ground up in a
solution which is then placed in a centrifuge at a very high speed to
separate the particles.
Axis, the pioneering part of the company's business, is also working with
another arm of the company, Cambridge Plant Breeders, to manipulate the
genes in crops so that they become resistant to certain pests. This
eliminates the need to use expensive pesticides.
Farmers are under increasing pressure to restrict their use of chemicals and
improve their environmental practices. This is likely to lead to increasing
demand for bio-pesticides which the company also produces.
The agrochemicals industry currently totals around Dollars 26bn a year
worldwide while organic pesticides account for less than 1 per cent of that.
Analysts suggest that the bio-pesticides market could grow into sales of at
least Dollars 2bn in the next 10 years.
That would be a huge leap for many of the small biotechnology companies
involved in developing these products. But they will probably move into
alliances with the big chemicals groups such as Ciba, Bayer and Norsk Hydro
to distribute the products.
MicroBio, another arm of the company, has developed a way of rearing tiny
worms called nematodes, which prey on slugs - a product which has huge
applications in the gardening and agricultural markets. The product sold out
when it was released to the home and garden market earlier this year.
One reason for the planned stock market launch is to raise funds for
expansion. Agricultural Genetics' production of organic pesticides, along
with its programme of manipulating genes in crops to make the plant
resistant to certain insects, are projects which have created a lot of
interest as farmers try to cut back on their use of agrochemicals.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Accountancy: Creative catch from Atlantic's muddy waters -
Andrew Jack on a report that highlights one of the most extraordinary
corporate episodes of the 1980s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The story of Atlantic Computers began with all the continent-bridging energy
that the name of the company implies, and ended up unceremoniously drowning
directors, investors and advisers alike.
Last week's highly critical report from Department of Trade and Industry
inspectors (an investigation itself costing a gargantuan Pounds 6.5m spread
over four years) highlights one of the most extraordinary corporate episodes
of the 1980s.
Atlantic was founded in 1975 to provide leasing, lease-financing, broking,
and the sale of computers. It would order computers, arrange lease terms and
sell them to customers with benefit of leases. It was floated in 1983, and
by 1988 was gobbled up by British &amp; Commonwealth, the listed financial
services group, for Pounds 408m. Two years later, both Atlantic and its new
parent had collapsed.
Including additional money injected since 1988, B &amp; C had made an investment
of Pounds 485m - or nearly half of its assets - by April 1990, when it was
rewarded by the suspension of its shares and the appointment of
administrators.
Between 1983 and 1988, Atlantic had reported aggregate pre-tax profits of
Pounds 127.6m. According to the DTI's two inspectors, had it been accounting
prudently, it would have reported no significant profits at all.
The inspectors conclude: 'Throughout its life Atlantic employed a number of
commercial and accounting devices to increase its reported profits and
postpone impact of its contingent liabilities'.
The root cause of Atlantic's problems, they argue, was a simple business
one: the lack of commercial viability of its core product, known as
Flexlease. The company was able to keep these troubles concealed by the way
in which it accounted for profits and failed to make provision for the
contingent liabilities it incurred.
From the late 1970s till the mid 1980s, accounting rules and capital
allowances in the UK 'were favourable for leasing as opposed to other forms
of financing', as the inspectors euphemistically put it.
Flexlease offered a six-year lease, with the scope for two options: 'flex'
(allowing renegotiating for a new agreement after three years) and 'walk'
(to terminate the lease after five years). The options gave rise to large
potential liabilities.
The inspectors say that Atlantic's directors counted on the gross
liabilities of the leases being reduced by earnings on replacement leases.
Future profits were anticipated to cover current losses which were not
provided for in the accounts.
This was, they say, 'an unsound basis for a long-term business'. It was only
viable if there was a sound basis for believing that the future residual
value of returned computer equipment would at least equal the cost of
meeting the outstanding lease obligations at the flex and walk points in the
lease. The past pattern of depreciation suggested otherwise.
The inspectors say there was also 'an element of commercial deception'
inherent in the arrangement. The walk option was a clear obligation, but the
flex option was worded in a way to apparently suggest there were contractual
rights to exchange equipment when these were probably legally unenforceable.
So Atlantic reported the gross margin in full as profit in the year each
lease was sold. It made no advance provision for potential liabilities
attached to the flex or walk obligations. It also offered no disclosure of
the walk obligations in the accounts, while the flex obligations were noted
but their magnitude not included.
These two elements rendered Atlantic's accounting policies 'imprudent', and
meant that the accounts were not 'true and fair' at least since 1983 and
possibly since the commencement of the company. It was, in short, able to
report substantial, fast-growing profits while large potential liabilities
were built up but not disclosed. By early 1989 the gross potential (and
unrecorded) liabilities of the walk options were Pounds 160m.
The report suggests that the Atlantic directors also indulged in a catalogue
of other creative accounting devices. They reported as profit the estimated
value of residual interests in leased computer equipment. They used
'artificial' routes to justify the accounting for the acquisition of two
businesses, ICA and Comcap, and created a company with inadequate records
for monitoring.
Atlantic postponed its contingent liability problem through a wide range of
techniques. It adjusted the treatment of its own-book leases financed by
hire purchase. It used two ways to generate incorrect accounting for
transactions close to the year-end.
First, it mismatched revenue and costs by failing to record all costs
connected with a transaction in the year in which they were reported and by
backdating transactions. Second, it employed duplicate acceptance notes on
leases, with the date left blank or typed in after customer signatures.
Between 1981 and 1988 it made five prior year adjustments, 'the common theme
being a resulting benefit to reported profits', as the inspectors say:
through stock adjustment, changes to 'unsound' or 'illegitimate' accounting
policies.
When the size of Atlantic's liabilities emerged in 1989, the directors
decided not to tell the auditors. The 1988 accounts required a provision for
walk obligations of Pounds 175.9m. The inspectors say that much effort went
into seeking an 'accounting solution' to deal with liabilities without
damaging current profitability.
Wherever there is questionable accounting, the spotlight needs also to turn
to the auditors, of course. The report provides intriguing insights into the
way in which Atlantic and B &amp; C handled a number of large firms of
accountants.
In fact, many of the problems with Atlantic's accounting were picked up: in
a draft report at the time of Atlantic's flotation by Price Waterhouse, for
example - and in work conducted by KPMG Peat Marwick after it took over as
auditor to Atlantic. What is worrying is how such danger signals were able
to be concealed for so long.
In 1982, Atlantic indulged in some 'opinion shopping' with three firms to
support accounting policy on leases. Two - Arthur Young and Deloittes -
supported its existing stance, and their views were used to bolster its
position.
The company clearly put considerable pressure on Spicer and Pegler, its
auditor from 1983 till 1989, and now part of Touche Ross. At one point in
1982, a draft report from Spicer, which included the comment 'there exists a
contingent liability', was amended in the final version to read 'there
exists a possible contingent liability' with additional wording that no such
actual liability existed.
Atlantic's directors showed evidence of bullying their auditors. Internal
memos also suggested that they were worried that a switch to another firm of
auditors might reduce the 'flexibility' adopted by Spicer.
The inspectors say that Spicer, in turn, failed to develop a sufficiently
deep relationship with the company.
The firm had unrestricted access to the company's records, and should have
been aware of scale of the walk clauses. Instead, it seemed prepared to
accept the directors' assurances that no more than 5 per cent of the lease
contracts had such clauses. The true figure was nearer to 90 per cent in
some years.
The inspectors suggest that Spicer provided weak auditing which allowed
Atlantic's accounting to go unchecked. There were numerous deficiencies in
planning for successive audits, and shortcomings in carrying out the work.
It will be intriguing to see if any disciplinary actions follow from the
Atlantic debacle. It will be still more interesting to see whether the
profession and business heeds its lessons.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): When it pays to
complain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A dissatisfied customer who complains is just as likely to remain loyal as a
completely satisfied customer. This surprising state of affairs has been
observed by British Airways, which has turned the handling of complaints
into something of a science.
Charles Weiser, BA's head of customer relations, calculates that about 13
per cent of customers who are completely satisfied with BA's service may not
fly with the airline again. 'Perhaps they changed jobs, found a frequent
flyer programme which better suited their needs, or maybe they felt it was
time for a change of airline,' he says, writing in the July issue of
Consumer Policy Review, the journal published by the UK's Consumers'
Association.
Half of all customers who experience problems but do not complain, do not
intend to use the airline again. This contrasts with the customers who are
dissatisfied but do complain - just 13 per cent of this group will defect,
the identical rate of defection as the 'satisfied' group, says Weiser.
Clearly, it pays to encourage customers to complain, and to encourage
complaints departments to turn themselves from 'blame' to 'customer
retention' departments, he says. Weiser's guide to satisfying complaints
includes the following points:
Apologise and 'own' the problem. Customers do not care whose fault it was -
they want someone to say sorry and champion their cause.
Do it quickly - customer satisfaction with the handling of a complaint dips
after five days.
Assure customers the problem is being fixed. Complaints departments need to
know their company inside out and work with front-line departments.
Do it by phone. Many departments are frightened of the emotion customers
often show when things go wrong, but customers appreciate a personal apology
and assurance the problem will be solved.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Spending revival
under way - Diane Summers on three European advertising markets' strong
growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK, Sweden and Greece are likely to see particularly strong growth in
advertising expenditure in 1995, according to the latest forecasts from the
UK's Advertising Association and the European Advertising Tripartite*.
After three consecutive years of falling expenditure in the UK, growth is
forecast to accelerate to 6.2 per cent this year and 5.5 per cent in 1995.
Says the forecast: 'The UK has not seen this rate of advertising expenditure
growth since the boom years of 1986-88.'
Strongest real growth rates for 1994 are forecast for newspapers (8.3 per
cent); radio (11.2 per cent); and cinema (7 per cent). Even struggling trade
magazines are reported to be picking up, and the overall picture is likely
to be similar in 1995.
In Sweden, recovery is expected this year as the economy improves: the
forecast is for real growth of 5 per cent in 1994 and 6.5 per cent in 1995.
The television sector is experiencing strong growth, mostly at the expense
of newspapers and magazines, while the recently-deregulated radio sector
will also increase its share of advertising.
In spite of the Greek economy being stagnant last year, total advertising
expenditure grew by more than 8 per cent in real terms. The growth forecast
for this year is 7.5 per cent and 6 per cent in 1995. The fastest growing
sectors this year are likely to be television, newspapers and outdoor, while
magazines should see some real growth in 1995.
In a separate Advertising Association publication**, an analysis of UK
advertising spending in the first quarter of 1994 shows growth in all main
media sectors.
Radio did particularly well, with revenue rising in real terms by more than
24 per cent, compared with the first quarter of last year. Outdoor
advertising also did well, with an increase of almost 17 per cent.
The quarterly survey shows that national newspapers, 'fattened by the now
sharply rising tide of classified job recruitment advertising, experienced a
12 per cent real increase over the same period'.
Six product sectors showed double-digit growth in advertising expenditure
during the 12 months to the end of the first quarter: pharmaceutical (36.5
per cent); office equipment (26.6 per cent); financial (24.3 per cent);
retail and mail order (18.8 per cent); household equipment (15.7 per cent);
and motors (14.2 per cent).

FT  28 JUL 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Climbing the
slippery slope - Victor Mallet looks at how Castrol made a name for itself
in Vietnam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Castrol is hoping that its name will soon mean 'lubricant' in the Vietnamese
language, just as 'Honda' is the popular Vietnamese word for motorcycle.
The UK-based lubricants multinational has already gone a long way towards
that target in the past three years, and Castrol is a byword for successful
brand name promotion among foreign investors in Vietnam's undeveloped but
fast-growing market.
The green and red Castrol logo is prominently displayed not only in the
streets of Ho Chi Minh City - the southern commercial centre that includes
Saigon - but throughout the provinces of Vietnam, on advertisement
hoardings, car stickers and, above all, on some 4,000 signboards at
Vietnam's ubiquitous roadside garages and motorcycle cleaning shops.
Castrol says its own researchers have found that the company's rhythmic
local slogan 'Dau nhot tot nhat' ('Best quality lubricants') is recognised
by a remarkable 99 per cent of people in Ho Chi Minh City. Airport check-in
attendants even recite the slogan when they see a customer in a Castrol
shirt, according to George Webster, the South African-born general director
of Castrol Vietnam.
He says Castrol owes its marketing success in Vietnam to its early entry
into the market, its choice of a good local partner and a bit of
old-fashioned determination.
Castrol had been selling marine lubricants to Vietnam since 1981, and was
one of the first wave of foreign companies to invest in production
facilities when the communist government launched the policy of 'doi moi'
('renovation', the Vietnamese version of perestroika) in the late 1980s.
The Dollars 3.9m (Pounds 2.5m) joint venture company licensed in 1991 is
owned 60 per cent by Castrol and 40 per cent by Saigon Petro, a fuel import
and distribution company control-led by the Ho Chi Minh City people's
committee, the communist local government. The joint venture opened its
25,000-tonnes-a-year blending plant near Ho Chi Minh City two years ago and
employs 125 people.
At first Castrol Vietnam intended to concentrate on the market in and around
Saigon, but it soon found its products travelling north and south through
informal networks.
So the company established its own network of distribution agents in all but
five of the country's 52 provinces, and operated its own delivery fleet. The
peculiarities of the Vietnamese market mean that most provincial agents are
state companies, while most urban ones are private; and in some provinces
Castrol has two distributors, one for state and one for private customers.
The distribution drive was backed by television advertising and by the
painted signboards. Each of Castrol's three sales teams is supported by a
marketing services group. Working with the distributors, the salesmen
identify a suitable shop; the marketing team finds a contractor to paint a
sign for the owner and ensures the quality of the logo.
The first foreign investors in Vietnam were pioneers. Activities normally
farmed out to specialised service companies, such as buying television
airtime for advertisements, were handled by Castrol itself because such
companies did not exist. 'There's not a lot of external infrastructure,'
says Webster.
Despite its success in becoming Vietnam's brand leader in lubricants and in
setting up a national distribution network, Castrol has found it hard to
persuade the Vietnamese to switch from cheap, low-quality lubricants in
drums to its more expensive packaged products.
The packaged product, at 15,000 to 17,000 dong (about Dollars 1.50) a litre,
is three times the price of the cheaper oil in drums, which used to come
from the Soviet Union but is now imported from such countries as Taiwan and
Thailand. 'We are appealing to people who want to take care of their new
motorcycles,' says Webster. 'It's a slow process. Our main thrust is to
establish the Castrol brand in the consumer market and, with the high
awareness, we get quite a good run-off in the industrial market.'
The rival British company BP - in partnership with Petrolimex, the state
fuel importer and distributor - is investing in a blending plant with a
capacity of 50,000 tonnes a year and is marketing packaged and bulk products
to consumers.
The two companies see eye to eye, however, when they need to protect their
Vietnamese investments from cheap imports. One of the biggest headaches for
the two - which between them have invested in enough capacity to serve the
entire Vietnamese annual lubricant market of an estimated 75,000 tonnes -
has been to ensure that government taxes and customs tariffs favour local
producers over importers.
While Castrol was building its plant, tariffs on lubricants were
unexpectedly lowered from 10 per cent to 1 per cent - which meant that
Castrol would have been better off importing packaged lubricants from
Singapore - although they have now been raised again to between 18 and 20
per cent.
But cheating remains common. No sooner had the watchful Castrol executives
and their allies stemmed the flow of imported motor oil masquerading as
'hydraulic brake fluid' (which enjoys a 1 per cent tariff) than they noticed
a surge in imports of 'rubber process oil'.
Other foreign investors envy Castrol's marketing prowess in Vietnam, but
they question whether it is possible to make profits in such difficult
conditions. Webster says the profits may be small for the time being, but he
insists Castrol Vietnam has made money from its first month and was quicker
to get off the ground than Castrol subsidiaries started elsewhere in Asia in
the last five years.
An early investment and effective marketing of products to Vietnam's 70m
consumers were vital to Castrol's success, as Ian Pringle, Castrol
International's director for Asia, made clear during a recent visit to the
region. 'We were fortunate enough to be faster than our competitors,' he
said. 'We actually introduced consumer advertising to Vietnam.'

FT  28 JUL 94 / Norwich Union switches agents to salaries

Norwich Union, one of the UK's largest insurers, yesterday switched its life
and pensions sales agents from commission to salaries. The move is part of a
re-structuring of its direct sales operation, which will see a sharp cut in
its sales force.
Mr Philip Scott, Norwich Union life and pensions general manager, said there
would be a new sales force - Norwich Union Financial Services - which was
intended to expand to be 300 to 400-strong in three years' time, in contrast
to the existing life and pensions sales force of 500.
In March the insurer announced that it was suspending its entire sales force
for a month for re-training, after the life industry's regulator identified
breakdowns in management control.
Instead of being paid by commission on the policies they sell sales agents
in the new operation will receive a basic annual salary of Pounds 12,000 as
well as commission. The number of Norwich Union branch offices is to be
almost halved, from 25 to 13.
The reduction in the sales force and the restructuring of payments are signs
of the pressures affecting the life industry.
A new regime of giving the customer more information about products,
including the commission paid to sales agents, is to be introduced from the
beginning of next year.
Traditional life companies are also facing increasing competition from
entrants to the market, such as building societies, while the volumes of new
business are flat and likely to remain so for a while.
As well as the new sales force, Norwich Union will have a separate team of
about 20 sales agents, paid entirely by salary and devoted solely to dealing
with the insurer's past sales of personal pensions to those transferring out
of occupational schemes. The insurer has 5,000 such cases.
The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, is due to
publish a report soon giving guidance to companies on how to identify and
compensate those who have suffered as a result of following poor advice on
pensions.
Mr Scott said work on the change of strategy began last October. It
reflected a need to move from a culture in which insurers regarded service
as an optional addition to sales, to one where service to customers was
paramount.
He said he would be surprised if there was still a large industry sales
force paid entirely by commission in a couple of years. Among other large
insurers, Legal &amp; General and Allied Dunbar currently pay sales agents only
on the basis of commission.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Lenders repossess fewer homes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of homes repossessed by mortgage lenders in the first six months
of the year fell to 25,020 - 6.5 per cent less than in the second half of
last year - figures published yesterday show.
Statistics from the Council of Mortgage Lenders also showed fewer mortgages
in arrears.
The council, which represents building societies and other lenders, such as
banks, said that the improvements would be threatened by any reduction in
social security payments that help the unemployed with mortgage payments.
The figures showed that repossessions were at their lowest for a six-month
period since the first half of 1990 - although they were still significantly
higher than numbers of repossessions before that.
Mortgages in arrears continued to decrease, although not as sharply as last
year. There were 153,310 mortgages in arrears of six to 12 months at the end
of June, compared with 164,620 at the end of December and 191,560 at the end
of June last year.
Mortgages in longer-term arrears also decreased - to 142,230 at the end of
last month, compared with 151,810 at the end of December and 158,000 at the
end of June last year.
Mr Adrian Coles, the council's director-general, said that in a significant
number of cases the level of arrears was being prevented from worsening
because income support was paying the mortgage interest.
He said: 'If the rumours of government plans to cut back income support are
proved correct, the lifejacket which is currently keeping many households'
heads above water will be taken away.'

FT  28 JUL 94 / Sales of bricks increase to five-year high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brick sales by manufacturers were the highest for five years in the second
quarter of this year, according to figures published yesterday by the
Department of the Environment.
Viscount Ullswater, who was appointed construction minister in last week's
reshuffle, said the surge in sales provided a further encouraging sign of
economic recovery.
'Construction new orders and output, including housing starts, show similar
recent upward trends,' he said.
Suppliers said that after an increase in new-house sales in the early part
of this year, housing-brick shortages had started to develop.
Butterley, one of the country's biggest house-brick manufacturers, was
recently quoting 20 weeks' delivery time to builders contacting its Kirton
works in Nottinghamshire. The company said that at this time last year
builders could expect deliveries the following day,
The Department of the Environment said the number of bricks delivered by
manufacturers to customers during the second quarter rose to 997m. This is
the highest number since the second quarter of 1989.
As a result, manufacturers were able to reduce unsold stocks to 806m, the
lowest level for five years and almost half the peak of 1.55bn in the fourth
quarter of 1992.
Most of the remaining stock is higher-specification bricks used for offices,
shops and public buildings such as hospitals and schools. Construction
activity in this area has failed to recover to the same extent as in the
housing market.
The rise in sales has led to an increase of about a fifth in the average
ex-factory price of housing bricks from a low of about Pounds 100 a thousand
in autumn 1992 to about Pounds 120 a thousand now.
Mr Richard Manning, managing director of the brick division of Hanson, the
conglomerate which owns Butterley and London Brick, the country's biggest
brick manufacturer, said yesterday: 'Prices will have to rise further before
manufacturers start to reopen closed capacity. Margins are still too low and
it is still not worth their while to do so.'
Between 1987 and 1989, brick manufacturers spent Pounds 200m increasing
their capacity from 4.5bn to 5bn bricks a year. Permanent and temporary
closures subsequently have reduced this to 3.45bn, compared with sales of
3.13bn last year.
The number of workers employed by the industry has fallen from 14,000 in
December 1987 to 8,500 at the end of last year.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Troubled health authority 'concealed information'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Debt forecasts for South Birmingham District Health Authority last year
jumped from Pounds 12m to Pounds 16m in a month because 'information had
been concealed to feed out bad news in increments', the Commons public
accounts committee said in a critical report yesterday.
It says financial controls in the troubled authority were so poor that it
failed to recover Pounds 3m owed by other health authorities. South
Birmingham, West Midlands Regional Health Authority and the government's
National Health Service Executive all shared some responsibility for failure
to address the problems, it adds.
The committee says it was not clear why a former chief executive and finance
director of the South Birmingham authority, who were 'in effect dismissed
from their posts', had subsequently been working as NHS consultants.
Mr Tom Sackville, junior health minister, acknowledged that the report
addressed 'serious matters' - but said a range of remedial actions had
already been taken.
This new criticism of poor financial controls in the NHS comes as the
government is about to announce the results of a review aimed at
streamlining central administration and reducing bureaucracy. Mrs Virginia
Bottomley, health secretary, set up the review last year to determine the
future shape of the Department of Health now that much decision-making has
been devolved to local level.
Senior staff at the department's headquarters in Whitehall and the
Leeds-based NHS Executive, which has day-to-day managerial responsibility
for the service, have been told to stand by for an announcement on the
outcome of the review today.
It is certain to lead to job losses at both locations, in addition to cuts
which are arising from amalgamations of regional health authorities.
The British Medical Association yesterday told its members not to negotiate
local pay schemes with trust hospital managements as part of its resistance
to government proposals to introduce performance-related pay for doctors. A
special national conference to protest against the plans has been called by
the BMA for August 31.

FT  28 JUL 94 / SIB acts over group pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employers who set up group personal pension schemes would be best advised to
refer their employees to an independent financial adviser rather than try to
advise them on the scheme's merits themselves, regulators said yesterday.
The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog,
was responding to a request from the Association of Pension Lawyers for
guidance for employers.
Although employers who offer traditional final-salary and money-purchase
schemes have been given clearance to inform employees about scheme benefits,
the picture is more vague for those who set up schemes for groups to have
personal pensions with a specific life company.
SIB concluded that employers who set up a group personal pension scheme need
not seek authorisation to carry out investment business because they have no
commercial motive in mind.
If the employer receives some commission from a life insurer for doing so,
however, or receives a reduction of the premium on a general insurance
contract, the company may need to be authorised by the relevant
self-regulating authority.
While SIB would not consider literature explaining that a group personal
pension scheme had been set up to be advertising, any other literature
likely to encourage individuals to take up the offer could well be.
Such literature should be prepared only by an independent financial adviser
or the product provider.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Milk Marque to levy price rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Milk Marque, the successor to the Milk Marketing Board, is proposing a 5 per
cent increase in the price charged to dairy companies after they made bids
for nearly 30 per cent more milk than it has to offer.
Mr Andrew Dare, Milk Marque chief executive, speaking yesterday at the last
annual meeting of the Milk Marketing Board before its demise on October 31,
said the initial round of Milk Marque's new selling system had brought bids
from dairy customers for 9bn litres.
Milk Marque, a voluntary producers' co-operative, has so far signed up dairy
farmers representing 7bn litres, or 65 per cent of the milk output in
England and Wales.
Mr Dare said the co-operative would raise its average price to dairy
companies to 25.25p a litre from 24p in an attempt to reduce demand. This is
good news for its farmer members, who would see their prices rise from 22.5p
now to 24p if demand balances supply.
Dairy companies are unlikely to appreciate the price rise, having already
expressed concern about a smaller increase in the first round of the selling
process a month ago.
Mr Bob Steven, chairman of the Milk Marketing Board, acknowledged these
concerns. 'It would be madness for Milk Marque to try to push prices to
levels that would put its customers out of business,' he said yesterday.
At the same time, he said, Milk Marque's purpose was to give dairy farmers -
whom he described as 'minnows' compared with the dairy groups - an
opportunity to negotiate on equal terms with their customers.

FT  28 JUL 94 / CBI urges tax changes to aid investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Confederation of British Industry yesterday called for tax changes to
improve the investment performance of industry.
Responding to the Treasury's review of savings and investment, the CBI
rejected the idea that the tax credit on dividends should be further
reduced.
Until last week the review was being conducted by Mr Stephen Dorrell as
financial secretary to the Treasury. Mr Dorrell, who was appointed national
heritage secretary in the cabinet reshuffle, had expressed concern that the
high level of dividend payouts was restricting corporate investment. But the
CBI argued that, in the long term, the best way of increasing investment
would be to reduce the rate of corporation tax, thereby increasing the
retained earnings of businesses.
In the short term, however, the CBI called for a reform of capital gains
tax. The current top rate of 40 per cent should only apply if an investment
was held for under a year; gains on shares held for more than a year should
only be taxed at 20 per cent, with a further potential reduction to 10 per
cent for long-term holdings.
By changing the capital gains tax system, investors would be more inclined
to take returns in the form of capital gains and there would accordingly be
less pressure on companies to pay high dividends.
The CBI also called for a more generous system of capital allowances,
particularly to help small businesses.
The recommendations were discussed at the CBI's monthly council meeting
yesterday, which also expressed concern about the government's proposals for
minimum solvency standards for pension schemes. The CBI called for the
standards to be made more flexible, particularly for companies to be given
longer to take corrective action.
The organisation also responded to the white paper on European social policy
issued in Brussels yesterday. Sir Bryan Nicholson, president, said: 'In two
crucial respects, this white paper reflects CBI thinking. First, it
emphasises that employment creation must be the top priority in Europe. And
second, the white paper explicitly rejects the idea of a lengthy new
legislative agenda in Europe.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Outdated resorts are damaging the reputation of more attractive English
tourist attractions, making it difficult to persuade UK residents to take
their holidays at home, the English Tourist Board said yesterday.
The board said that over the past decade the UK's tourism balance of
payments had fallen from breakeven to a deficit of Pounds 3.1bn. The deficit
had grown in spite of the increase in foreign visitors to the UK.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Inheritance tax imposes a higher real burden today than when it was
introduced by Labour 20 years ago, says the Country Landowners Association.
In a Budget brief to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, the association said
it was a scandal that a government committed to low taxation and cascading
wealth through generations should have increased the burden of inheritance
tax on middle-range estates.
The association, whose members include owners of large farms and country
estates, said that the 40 per cent rate was one of the highest in the world.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Delors to speak to TUC gathering
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Delors, outgoing European Commission president, has agreed to
address the Trades Union Congress in Blackpool this autumn, in a move that
will be seen as a provocative act by the government and Conservative
Euro-sceptics.
He is expected to give a vigorous defence of the welfare state and full
employment and spell out his enthusiasm for a social dimension in the
European Union and the development of workers' rights.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Tyne and Wear Development Corporation attracted Pounds 116m of
private-sector investment in the 1993-94 financial year, the corporation's
annual report says.
The report, published yesterday, says private-sector investment in the area
has totalled Pounds 603m since the corporation started operating in 1987.
Since then, the corporation has ploughed Pounds 265m of public-sector funds
 -including Pounds 53.8m in 1993-94 - into the 27 miles of land beside the
Tyne and the Wear for which it is responsible.

FT  28 JUL 94 / MoD to order survey vessel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ministry of Defence plans to invite tenders for an ocean survey vessel
next month and to place the order by the end of the year, Mr Roger Freeman,
the defence procurement minister, said yesterday, Chris Tighe writes.
The news is a small boost to attempts by Constructions Mecaniques de
Normandie, the only prospective bidder for shipbuilder Swan Hunter, to
generate a two-year Pounds 50m workload for the Tyneside yard. The
government had previously said it hoped to order the ocean survey vessel,
likely to be worth about Pounds 45m, in January next year.
Mr Freeman said that if a proposal from CMN to provide performance and
financial guarantees for the refit of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary tanker Olwen
were acceptable to the ministry, there could be a little flexibility in its
August 1 deadline for the yard to achieve the 'firm financial footing'
needed before it could take on Olwen.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Blair stands against Post Office sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, yesterday launched a campaign to keep the
Post Office in the public sector.
He said he believed it would be 'foolish and dogmatic' to privatise a
profitable and successful Post Office and urged the government to give it
more commercial freedom in the public sector.
Labour's campaign was launched amid signs that ministers doubt whether they
will succeed in getting their favoured option of a partial sell-off through
the Commons.
Seven Tory MPs have signed an early-day motion calling for the corporation
to remain nationalised but with more commercial freedom.
A senior Whitehall official said: 'Ministers are not taking anything for
granted. No one is over-confident. The government does understand the
concerns of the so-called Post Office sceptics.'
The government has published a green paper setting out three options: full
privatisation of the Royal Mail and Parcelforce, the sale of 51 per cent of
the shares in the two companies, or more commercial freedom in the public
sector.
Mr Blair said Labour's campaign was not based on ideological opposition to
privatisation. He recently called for a 'dynamic market' and his advisers do
not want to give the impression that the party is opposed to all
privatisation.
Mr Blair fears that private owners of Royal Mail would try to cut costs by
reducing its payments to Post Office branches. 'That would put at risk many
community post offices that need cross subsidies to stay open,' he said.
Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said he would be
travelling to many Tory marginal seats in rural areas to warn of the threat
to village post offices that rely on cross subsidies.
Mr Bill Cockburn, Post Office chief executive, emphasised that the
government's decision to keep Post Office Counters in the public sector, but
with freedom to conduct a wider range of businesses, assured the future of
the countrywide network of 20,000 post offices.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Eggar to quiz industry on competitiveness measures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tim Eggar, the new minister for industry and energy, is to launch an
initiative to find out what crucial industrial sectors want from the
government to help them improve their competitiveness.
In his first briefing since last week's reshuffle - in which he took on the
industry portfolio at the Department of Trade and Industry in addition to
his energy responsibilities - Mr Eggar said the biggest issue for industry
was competitiveness. One of his roles would be to look at how to take the
issue forward following the publication in May by Mr Michael Heseltine,
trade and industry secretary, of the white paper on competitiveness.
Mr Eggar said he had asked officials to find out from industrial sectors and
sub-sectors the top three or four issues where government action could help
them.
The announcement does not amount to a change of policy by the DTI, and Mr
Eggar said he wanted industry to identify the priorities.
Mr Eggar's broader role follows the retirement of Mr Tim Sainsbury as
industry minister, and he also takes on responsibility for the Post Office.
Mr Charles Wardle, under-secretary of state for industry and energy,
supports him on all industry, energy and regional issues.

The Radio Authority was yesterday accused in the High Court of acting beyond
its powers in approving a scheme allowing the Emap media group to hold more
local radio licences than the Broadcasting Act permits.
Emap plans to take over Trans World Communications and so extend the number
of licences it holds from three to eight - two more than the Broadcasting
Act 1990 allows. The authority has sanctioned a structure whereby Emap would
hive off two licences to a new company jointly owned by Emap and Schroders,
its merchant bankers.
The legal challenge has been brought by Guardian Media Group, a 20 per cent
shareholder in TWC. The case continues today.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Minister predicts education revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pupils leaving school at 16 without plans for further education and training
will soon be a thing of the past, Mr Eric Forth, the new education minister,
said yesterday, Lisa Wood writes.
Mr Forth, commenting on education participation figures which take into
account those entering post-16 education in September last year, said: 'The
last 10 years have seen a revolution in the participation of 16 to
18-year-olds in education.'
The figures show that:
80 per cent of those aged 16 are staying on in full and part-time education
 -up by more than 15 percentage points since 1984.
Nearly 73 per cent of 16-year-olds are in full-time education - up 25
percentage points since 1984.
More than 55 per cent of pupils aged 16 to 18 are in full-time education - a
rise of more than 3 percentage points since last year.
The number of full-time pupils and students aged 16 to 18 is at an all-time
high of 924,000 in spite of a decrease in the size of the age group.

FT  28 JUL 94 / High collection rate reported for council tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most local councils have achieved high collection rates for council tax, the
Audit Commission says in a report on the first year of the tax, published
today.
The local authority watchdog says that almost 93 per cent of the Pounds
7.3bn to be paid by taxpayers in 1993-94 was collected by the end of March.
Under the poll tax, councils managed to collect less than 90 per cent of the
tax in the year it was due.
Some councils have experienced problems in council-tax collection, however,
in part because of the legacy of difficulties in collecting the poll tax.
Nine had collected less than 80 per cent of the tax due, with the London
borough of Lambeth having brought in less than half.
The report says that almost Pounds 1.8bn of poll tax remained uncollected at
the end of March, a year after the tax was abolished.
There is expected to be Pounds 1.5bn outstanding by the end of next year,
much of which will have to be written off as too expensive to col-lect, the
commission believes.
According to the commission the cost of collecting poll tax arrears averages
Pounds 100 per case. But targeting recovery on the largest arrears can still
be cost-effective, the report says. People who owe Pounds 250 or more
account for more than 60 per cent of the money outstanding.
The commission says that the success of local authorities in collecting
council tax has restored the credibility of local taxation.
One in seven councils, however, had collected less than 90 per cent of the
tax due by the end of March, and no money had been collected from a fifth of
households in some authorities, largely because of poor record-keeping or
slow administration.
The 12 inner-London boroughs, which suffered some of the best organised poll
tax strikes, are among the worst performing councils. But some rural areas
such as Kerrier in Cornwall and Charnwood in Leicestershire are also among
the laggards, the commission says.
It says: 'There is only a very weak link between collection rates and the
extent of an area's deprivation.'
Collecting council tax and the uniform business rate cost local authorities
about Pounds 700m last year, the commission says. This is more than is spent
on refuse collection.
The commission says costs vary between Pounds 7 and Pounds 30 per household.
There was no correlation between cost and collection rates - one of the
highest collection rates was achieved by one of the lowest-cost authorities.
It says more needs to be done to use computer systems to improve collection
levels. Sixty per cent of councils cannot easily identify those who have
paid nothing and many fail to target persistent late payers who need firmer
action to get them to pay.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Cash curbs on housing attacked: Use of derivatives
recommended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Housing associations could soon be allowed to use financial derivatives such
as futures and swaps to reduce interest rate risks in borrowing to build
low-cost homes for rent or sale.
The Housing Corporation, the quango that regulates registered housing
associations, is to consult housing associations and interested bodies over
proposals to lift restrictions on using derivatives which are recommended in
a report on improving associations' treasury management.
The report, drawn up by the management consultancy arm of Touche Ross, the
accountants, says that derivatives could help associations to manage the
treasury risks, including their exposure to movements in interest rates.
Housing Associations are raising an increasing proportion of the cost of
building new homes on the capital markets, much of it at floating rates.
Where funding is at fixed rates it is often through loans that will have to
be refinanced in the future.
The report says that using derivatives could help associations to improve
the interest rate maturity profile of their borrowing portfolio.
Housing Corporation rules for registered housing associations restrict the
use of derivatives to the point when loans are taken out and for changing an
existing derivative. Most associations have not changed their rules to take
advantage ofthese restricted applications.
The report warns that many finance managers in associations have only
limited experience of interest rate management products.
Financial institutions are wary of dealing in derivatives with associations
after a legal ruling that the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, an
active sterling interest rate swaps trader, did not have the power to enter
into derivative con-tracts.
Touche Ross recommends that the restrictions be lifted for associations that
have the expertise, structure and processes to use them safely. But it says
that they should not be allowed to write options except to close out an
existing option position.
The report also proposes a prohibition on speculation. The Housing
Corporation said yesterday that it would want the treasury function to be
seen as a cost centre in associations, not a profit centre.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Joint ventures may face tighter rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Joint ventures and associate companies will be subject to tighter reporting
requirements under proposals published yesterday by the Accounting Standards
Board.
They should be defined as 'strategic alliances' and treated by the equity
accounting method, the proposals recommend.
The details are contained in a discussion document which could be turned
into a more detailed draft standard by the middle of next year.
They go beyond the existing requirements of companies legislation and SSAP1,
the accounting standards of associated companies.
Joint ventures are currently subject to varying forms of accounting. They
can be 'proportionately consolidated', which means their financial details
are included in a company's consolidated accounts line by line.
Under the equity method, profits and assets are included in accounts on the
basis of the proportion of total shares held in the venture.
Associates - defined as investments in which a company has a participating
interest and 'significant influence' - are already treated by the equity
method, but the ASB is trying to clarify the position.
The ASB also yesterday issued the final draft chapter of its 'statement of
principles' on entities for which accounts must be prepared.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Bus group forced into price pledge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stagecoach Holdings, the bus company, has been required to give two sets of
undertakings about its conduct, it emerged yesterday.
Sussex Coastline Buses, part of the Stagecoach group, has given undertakings
to limit fare rises and maintain the frequency of service on two bus routes
in Bognor Regis after a Monopolies and Mergers Commission report found it
had acted anti-competitively.
Stagecoach Holdings has already clashed with the competition authorities
this year.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said yesterday he had
accepted the undertakings from Sussex Coastline, formerly Southdown Motor
Services, to remedy the adverse affect on competition of its actions.
An MMC report published in June 1993 found that Southdown had charged
uneconomic fares on two routes in Bognor Regis to undermine services
operated by Easy Rider Minicoaches. Easy Rider subsequently withdrew from
Bognor Regis.
The undertakings will apply until March 17 next year.
In a second development, Stagecoach Holdings has given undertakings about
its behaviour when tendering for bus routes following its acquisition in
1989 of Formia, holding company of the Hastings and District bus company.
Mr Brian Cox, managing director of Stagecoach South, said: 'We are growing
and this sort of thing happens. These undertakings are not at all onerous
but we have no intention of doing any of the things they were anxious
about.'
Earlier this year, Fife Scottish Omnibuses, a Stagecoach Holdings
subsidiary, gave undertakings about its good conduct after an OFT
investigation found it had tried to remove a competitor from the market.
Stagecoach Holdings is still discussing with the OFT the undertakings it
should give after its acquisition of Lancaster City Transport was judged to
be against the public interest.
Stagecoach Holdings, which has made five acquisitions in the past 15 months,
yesterday announced a 46 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 18.9m in
the year ending in April.

Delicate behind-the-scenes talks were going on yesterday with the
conciliation service Acas in an attempt to establish an agreed framework for
a return to the negotiating table in the signalling staff dispute.
Both Railtrack and the RMT transport union were holding bilateral
discussions with Acas officials, but it was unclear last night how quickly
the two sides could restart formal bargaining on a settlement of the
seven-week conflict.
A Railtrack official said: 'We do not want to resume negotiations formally
if we find this simply leads once more to a dead end.' Last time the two
sides met there were 13 exhausting hours of talks, ending in breakdown at
3am on July 12.
Neither Railtrack nor the RMT negotiators want to endure a repetition of
those negotiations. Yesterday Acas officers were trying to discover whether
enough movement had taken place on both sides to justify a resumption of
formal talks.
A Railtrack official said: 'We have to clear up the ambiguities.' The
company is prepared to negotiate flexibly on its current pay offer, with
early improvements in wages for signalling workers before completion of the
whole restructuring package.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT general secretary, said his union was ready to
negotiate on restructuring as a whole, although until now it has insisted on
an interim pay rise for past efficiencies.
Railtrack yesterday said that one in seven signalmen was working normally in
defiance of the 48-hour strike that ends at noon today. It said that 162
signallers out of a possible 1,200 covering a normal shift were working
alongside supervisors at noon yesterday, enabling Railtrack to open 236
signal boxes, 21.3 per cent of the total.
The company added that 34 per cent of the network was opened as a result,
with services operating for the first time on several important commuter
routes in south-east England.
Mr John Ellis, Railtrack's production director, said: 'The situation is
looking good for a smooth return to normal operations from midday today.'
The next strike will be for 24 hours from noon on Wednesday to noon the
following day. The RMT is due to announce the result of its strike ballot of
its 550 supervisors on August 4. If they back the dispute, it could lead to
a sharp escalation of the conflict after August 11, the first day the
supervisors could be lawfully involved.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Porter fails in move to make auditor quit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dame Shirley Porter, former leader of Westminster City Council, has failed
in an attempt to have Mr John Magill, the district auditor, replaced before
public hearings this October.
Her move was supported by at least one of the other nine former Westminster
councillors and officials who, with Lady Porter, Mr Magill has recommended
should be surcharged a total of Pounds 21.5m.
Lady Porter applied to the Audit Commission, the local authority watchdog,
in April to have Mr Magill replaced by a new auditor. Mr Bill Phillips,
former chief executive of the council, made a similar application in the
month before but both have been rejected.
The row follows Mr Magill's preliminary findings in January that 'designated
sales' of council houses in the late 1980s were unlawful.
He ruled that the policy of removing 500 council properties a year from
public ownership was designed to increase owner-occupancy in eight marginal
wards and boost the Conservative party vote.
It was also at the price of failing to fulfil obligations to the homeless
and other priority housing groups.
In her letter of complaint to the Audit Commission Lady Porter, through her
solicitors Brecher &amp; Co, criticised Mr Magill over the press conference he
held in January.
The letter says: 'The behaviour of Mr Magill is in our view ill-judged. In
these circumstances the removal of Mr Magill is a necessary step in the
interests of justice.'
She also complained that 'the report and summary prepared by Mr Magill and
provided by him to the media go far beyond merely provisional findings'.
Mr Magill, in his submission to the Audit Commission, said: 'My note of
provisional findings and views makes abundantly clear that my findings and
views are provisional only. I retain an open mind.'
Mr Roger Rosewell, a spokesman for Lady Porter, said yesterday that it was
likely that she would personally ask Mr Magill to stand down before public
hearings start in London on October 17 or at the beginning of the hearings.
Mr Rosewell said yesterday: 'We have no confidence in his impartiality. We
have to persuade him that what he said at the press conference in January
was disgraceful.'
Mr Magill said earlier this month that he hoped that any approach to him to
disqualify himself would come before the beginning of the public hearings to
avoid inconvenience.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Redwood rapped on policy stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, was yesterday accused of pursuing his
personal rightwing agenda against the grain of government policy by
announcing that housing associations in Wales would no longer be allowed to
buy private-sector property.
Mr Redwood, who has contradicted government policy in the past, said that
the policy of allowing housing associations to buy property was against the
Tories' 'right-to-buy' principle.
In a statement, he said that Welsh housing associations would be encouraged
to expand their low-cost ownership schemes, saying that they should be
'building new homes not buying existing properties'.
He added: 'The idea that social housing can only be rented was one of the
oddest of British social policy.'
However one government official described Mr Redwood's ideas as
'ideologically-driven drivel'.
Mr David Rendel, the Liberal Democrats' housing spokesman, said that Mr
Redwood was 'set on undermining government policy with his own rightwing
agenda'.
Mr Redwood's statement contradicted the government's decision nearly two
years ago to allow housing associations to buy private property in order to
stimulate the property market.
Housing for Wales, the agency which funds and supervises housing
associations in the principality, was given a grant of Pounds 35m to buy
unsold private houses.
Under the initiative, 27 housing associations in Wales bought a total of
1,198 homes from the private sector.
However, government officials have said that such purchases in England and
Wales are only a fraction of total housing association expenditure, most of
which is on new building projects.

FT  28 JUL 94 / CIA looks for a role as the cold war becomes history: Ken
Warn sees the intelligence organisation under fire from all sides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEN WARN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Central Intelligence Agency is not alone these days in downsizing to
meet changed international circumstances. But for the CIA, adapting to
tighter budgets and rapidly changing intelligence needs is proving
particularly painful.
The organisation finds itself under fire from all sides, facing a hostile
press, an expansionist Federal Bureau of Investigation, and even a
threatened media onslaught from Mr Aldrich Ames, the CIA operative who
admitted spying for Moscow for nearly 10 years and was sentenced to life
imprisonment in April.
In Congress there are those such as Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan who
believe the demise of the Soviet Union, the focus of CIA activity for most
of its 50 years, means the agency has outlived its usefulness altogether.
More than any other single problem, the agency is operating under the shadow
of the Ames debacle. In an outspoken attack last week, Mr James Woolsey, CIA
director, called Ames 'a malignant betrayer of his country  - who killed a
number of people who helped the US and and the west win the cold war. He
killed them just as surely as if he pulled the trigger of a revolver put to
their heads in the basement of the Lubyanka prison.'
Mr Ames is believed to be negotiating from his prison cell with the US media
to launch an attack on his old employers. At his sentencing Mr Ames referred
to US espionage as undertaken by the CIA and other agencies as 'a
self-serving sham carried out by careerist bureaucrats'.
Under the barrage of criticism, Mr Woolsey last week unveiled 'a
comprehensive overhaul' of the way the CIA does business. That will include
tightening personnel security in an effort to avoid another Ames case, along
with a review of operations, analysis, science and technology, and
administration.
Mr Woolsey said he also wanted to change the CIA's culture, making managers
more accountable for their mistakes and making the agency less of a closed,
white male fraternity. Congress is preparing to investigate claims of
discrimination by over 100 female agents and belated moves are under way to
place women in more senior positions.
The CIA is also making sharp cuts in staffing, both at its Langley,
Virginia, headquarters and abroad, as funding dwindles. The closure of 15
stations in Africa was announced last month.
The House of Representatives voted last week to keep the CIA budget secret
for at least another year, but it is is estimated at about Dollars 3bn out
of the Dollars 28bn (Pounds 18bn) devoted to the US intelligence community.
Much of the other Dollars 25bn goes to fund costly satellite and electronic
espionage. Spending has been declining steeply in real terms since 1990.
In his 18 months as CIA director, Mr Woolsey has already sought to shift the
emphasis of CIA operations in the wake of the collapse of its principal foe.
In a world of multiple threats of nuclear proliferation, terrorism, drug
cartels, and doubts over the stability of Russia and China, he argues, the
CIA is far from being a relic of the cold war.
However, this new focus inevitably brings turf battles with other bodies
such as the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration.
In addition, Mr Woolsey has sought to make the CIA more responsive to US
economic needs, attuning it to the Clinton administration's agenda. While
denying absolutely that the agency conducts industrial espionage on behalf
of US business, Mr Woolsey said the CIA would follow macro-economic
developments more closely, particularly in Russia and China, and continue to
monitor sales of dual-use technology.
Tracking and objecting to foreign companies' efforts to 'bribe their way to
contracts' in US export markets - which US companies are forbidden to do
under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act - saved US business 'several billion
dollars a year' at a 'conservative' estimate, he said.
Under its director Mr Louis Freeh, the FBI appears to have been one of the
main beneficiaries of the CIA's difficulties. This month Mr Freeh opened an
FBI office in Moscow while on an energetic swing through eastern Europe. The
growing internationalisation of the FBI's crime-fighting efforts, looking at
issues such as preventing the theft of former Soviet nuclear materials and
weapons, strays directly into CIA territory.
Following a review of counter-intelligence co-ordination ordered by
President Bill Clinton after the Ames case, a senior FBI member was
appointed to head a new counter-intelligence centre based at the CIA, in a
blow to the agency's pride.
Mr Woolsey's speech was his toughest response yet to his proliferating
troubles. But it is not clear if any internal review, however thorough, will
head off demands for an external root and branch investigation of US
intelligence.
In a defiant message to 'those who wish America ill', Mr Woolsey said: 'Let
me be quite clear: we are changing but we are not going away. Do not equate
a decline in resources and size with a decrease in vigilance. Do not confuse
a re-assessment of our mission with a retreat from our responsibilities.'

FT  28 JUL 94 / Brazil presidential candidate drops his running mate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the leading left-wing candidate for Brazil's
presidency, has replaced his running mate just over two months ahead of the
poll, following corruption allegations.
Mr da Silva's campaign has been virtually paralysed for the last three weeks
because of media allegations against Senator Jose Paulo Bisol of the
Brazilian Socialist party.
Ironically, Mr Bisol was one of the leading inquisitors during a
congressional corruption investigation held earlier this year.
Mr Bisol will be replaced as vice presidential candidate by Mr Aloizio
Mercadante, a leading congressman from Mr da Silva's Workers' party and a
possible finance minister in a da Silva government. Mr Mercadante represents
the centre ground of the Workers' party and is considered a skilful media
debater.
A meeting of Mr da Silva's coalition partners on Tuesday evening agreed to
the change, which they hope will refire his campaign for the October 3
election.
Mr da Silva's main opponent, former finance minister Mr Fernando Henrique
Cardoso, has virtually drawn level in the polls this month after being 20
points behind. This recovery has largely been due to a sharp fall in
inflation following the introduction of a new currency on July 1, which Mr
Cardoso negotiated through Congress.
Mr Bisol's position was undermined by allegations that he submitted
amendments to the federal budget for overpriced public works projects
benefiting property he owned. Mr Bisol denied the allegations but said he
had acted naively and would withdraw the amendments.
The allegations, although dismissed by the da Silva campaign as a media
smear, were regarded as particularly damaging to Mr da Silva, who is
supported by many Brazilians because of his commitment to clean government.
Both Mr da Silva and Mr Cardoso have the support of about 30 per cent of
voters, with other candidates on less than 10 per cent, according to a
recent Gallup poll. After October's election the two are expected to meet in
a run-off ballot on November 15.

FT  28 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Delay ordered for Thai rail project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Thai government yesterday postponed the construction of a Dollars 1.5bn
elevated railway which would have been the first system to enter service in
the capital, reviving doubts about plans to build mass transit networks to
alleviate Bangkok's traffic congestion.
The delay is also likely to increase the reluctance of foreign investors to
take part in politically controversial infrastructure projects in Thailand.
It follows difficulties experienced with other projects including 'Skytrain'
in 1992 and the Kumagai Gumi elevated motorway in Bangkok which was
effectively nationalised earlier this year.
Bangkok Transit System Corp (BTSC), a subsidiary of the Tanayong property
group, had been due to begin preliminary work on the 24km of elevated
railway lines yesterday but the cabinet ordered a halt pending a resolution
of disputes over planning permission.
Earlier this month, BTSC awarded a turnkey construction contract for the
system worth Dollars 1.1bn to a joint venture between Siemens of Germany and
Italian-Thai Development, the leading Thai construction company. Financing
for the deal, which would have raised the total cost by some Dollars 400m,
has yet to be finalised.
Yesterday, the government said it had ordered the Juridical Council, an
arbitration body, to consider whether a 4km extension to the original 1991
concession could go ahead legally; the extension was agreed after laws on
the environment and privatisation came into force in 1992.
The cabinet also complained that plans to manage road traffic during
construction had not been sent to the authorities in time.
But some political commentators believe the real reason for the delay is
government nervousness over no-confidence motions in parliament this week.
Opposition MPs say they have evidence of illegal actions committed by the
government in connection with the project.
Successive governments have failed to plan for the rapid expansion of
Bangkok or to agree on how to improve transport for the city's
long-suffering commuters. Even if the BTSC project proceeds it is not clear
how it will be connected to other proposed systems.
Thailand is seeking to farm out some big infrastructure project to the
private sector in 'build-operate-transfer' concessions such as the one
granted to BTSC, but a series of hitches have affected investor confidence
in large Thai projects.
The most notorious case of a failed project was the Skytrain; Thailand
finally cancelled the Dollars 2.6bn project, which was to have been built by
SNC-Lavalin of Canada, in 1992 after 17 years of negotiations.

FT  28 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Seoul and Beijing in air accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An aviation agreement signed yesterday between South Korea and China removes
an air transport bottleneck in the fast-growing north-east Asian region.
The provisional pact, reached after almost two years of talks, opens direct
scheduled flights between Seoul and the northern Chinese cities of Beijing,
Shenyang, Qingdao, Tianjin and Dalian.
The accord will end cumbersome routes between the two countries and almost
halve flight times between Seoul and Beijing.
The agreement could also eventually allow South Korean carriers to acquire
overflight rights through Chinese airspace, reducing flight times to Europe
by two hours and helping to transform Seoul into a regional aviation hub.
The establishment of beyond-point rights will be subject to future talks.
Scheduled flight services, which will replace charter flights between the
two countries, are likely to begin in three months after technical
arrangements have been completed and a treaty is signed.
But disputes remain over flights between Seoul and cities in southern China,
including Shanghai.
The main stumbling block to a Sino-South Korean aviation pact has been
disagreement over the location of the flight control transfer point, which
is linked to territorial rights over sea boundaries and airspace.
China has agreed to establish the flight control point in the northern
region at 124 degrees longitude, in accordance with South Korea's demands
and a 1963 ruling by the International Civil Aviation Organisation.
But Beijing is still insisting the control point in the southern region
should be established at 125 degrees longitude, which Seoul regards as an
invasion of its boundaries. Until the issue is resolved, flights to Shanghai
will rely on charter services using the air corridor between Japan and
China.
It is forecast that the opening of regular services will boost air passenger
traffic on the Sino-Korean routes to 300,000-400,000 persons a year, from
150,000 last year, 75 per cent of whom were South Koreans.
Airlines from both countries will share services equally. These will include
18 weekly flights between Seoul and Beijing.
South Korea is expected to open talks soon with Taiwan on the resumption of
direct scheduled flights, which were suspended following the severing of
diplomatic ties in August 1992 after Seoul recognised Beijing.

liberalisation
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China yesterday threatened to back away from commitments to further
liberalise its trading regime in an angry response to what it perceives as
US attempts to impose tough conditions on its re-entry to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Chinese officials have made no secret of their displeasure at the US role in
complex negotiations over the resumption of China's Gatt status.
Mr Miao Fuchun, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Co-operation, said Beijing's patience was wearing thin and it was unclear
whether compromise was possible under present circumstances.
'The negotiations have reached a critical moment. Our application is
supported by a majority of the contracting parties, including Japan and the
European Union. But the US has made excessive demands we cannot accept,' he
said.
'It is not treating us as a developing country, which we obviously are. We
will not rejoin Gatt just for the sake of it. If China is unable to resume
its Gatt status, it will not be bound by Gatt and all the commitments made
over the past eight years will be nullified.'
Mr Miao repeated similar threats issued by other senior trade officials,
including Mrs Wu Yi, the foreign trade minister. But his remarks were
sharper and underline growing Chinese frustration over what Beijing sees as
the slow progress of negotiations.
Talks on China's application to rejoin Gatt, which it left in 1949, are due
to resume in Geneva this week. But though Beijing is keen to conclude them
in time to become a founding member of the World Trade Organisation early
next year, observers say that will require rapid progress in the next few
months.
Though Gatt members hope to agree soon on the basis for a draft protocol for
China's accession, the US and the EU insist that much will depend on whether
Beijing presents a package of acceptable concessions in September.
The EU is prepared to grant Beijing's request for a transition period to
adjust to Gatt obligations after it joins. The US argues that China should
enter on terms similar to those required for a developed country.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A farm trade battle between the US and Canada came closer yesterday as trade
ministers from both countries again failed to settle their dispute over
Canadian wheat sales in the US.
Mr Roy MacLaren, the Canadian trade minister, spoke only briefly after
meeting his US counterpart, Mr Mickey Kantor. The two sides had discussed
many other issues, he said. They now understood each other on grain and
'will be in touch' in the immediate future, he said.
However, the Clinton administration is under strong pressure from a few
influential senators to act quickly under a US law which allows the
president to limit imported commodities found to interfere with the US price
support programme. That statute is likely to be abolished with the launch of
the World Trade Organisation, which could happen in January.
The Canadians have threatened to retaliate against any US sanctions. Their
scope for action is wide. Canada is a key market for many US grain products.
All six members of the US International Trade Commission this month found
that Canada's wheat sales had interfered with the price support scheme.
However, in recommendations sent to the White House last Friday, three
concluded that there were several reasons for 'the small adverse impact' on
wheat prices, including last year's US floods and unfavourable weather in
both countries.
The three also said Canadian grain had been given competitive advantages
through its rail subsidies and the Canadian wheat board.
The three commissioners recommended 10 per cent tariffs on quantities of
non-durum wheat which exceed 1m tonnes and 10 per cent tariffs on imports of
durum when that exceed 500,000 tonnes. The other three commissioners
recommended stiffer penalties.

FT  28 JUL 94 / US durable goods orders rise 1.3%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
New orders for US durable goods increased 1.3 per cent last month and 13.3
in the year to June, indicating that prospects for US manufacturers remain
bright, the Commerce Department reported yesterday.
The figures surprised Wall Street analysts who had projected a less robust
monthly increase of about 0.5 per cent.
Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, said the gain was 'entirely accounted for
by increases in non-defence, non-aviation capital goods, which rose 6.4 per
cent to a new all-time high'. The high level of business investment was
likely to support 'balanced and sustainable growth', he said.
The June figures showed gains in most industrial sectors. Orders for
transport equipment, industrial machinery and electronic equipment were up
2.3, 2.2 and 1.1 per cent respectively from May. Orders for primary metals
fell 3.1 per cent but this followed a strong gain in May.
The figures follow a series of reports - including a deceleration in growth
of retail sales and industrial production - that appeared to indicate
economic growth was easing somewhat, lessening the immediate pressure on the
Federal Reserve to curb the expansion by raising short-term interest rates
again.
In congressional testimony last week Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman,
said he saw the economy 'settling into more moderate rates of growth over
the next six quarters and inflation remaining relatively subdued'. But he
said there were conflicting signals and warned that he might need to raise
short-term rates further to keep inflation under control.
Analysts are now keenly awaiting figures on gross domestic product for the
second quarter, due on Friday. The consensus view is that the economy
expanded at an annual rate of about 3.5 per cent, roughly in line with
growth of 3.4 per cent in the first three months, and sharply lower than the
annualised 7 per cent registered in the fourth quarter of last year.
But some forecasters are projecting annualised growth of as much as 5 per
cent.

FT  28 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Political static on HK-Taiwan route - The
1997 factor is getting in the way of inter-company negotiations over air
rights
</HEADLINE>

Negotiations over air rights between Hong Kong and Taiwan - one of the most
profitable air routes in east Asia - is becoming another field of battle
between Beijing and Taipei.
At stake is the renewal of an inter-company air service agreement that
allows Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong based airline, and China Airlines (CAL)
of Taiwan to fly between the British colony and Taipei more than 200 times a
week.
'We hope we can negotiate another five-year deal,' said one Cathay official.
'But there are a number of complications which won't make this a simple
agreement.'
Both companies have been put in the unusual position of having to negotiate
an agreement - which would normally fall to governments - because there are
no direct political relations between Britain and Taiwan. Given the current
state of relations across the Taiwan Straits, however, Taipei and Beijing
appear to be using the negotiations over the agreement - which expires next
April - to further other aims.
Beijing wants direct air links between the mainland's principal regional
capitals and Taipei and Kaohsiung, the island republic's second city,
located on the south-western tip of the island. It remains unclear how hard
Beijing will push to secure these concessions, but it does have power to
frustrate the talks given the change in Hong Kong's sovereignty in mid-1997.
China's interference appears to be behind the delay in other air services
talks, including those between Taiwan and Japan. The two sides last met in
February and no subsequent meeting has been scheduled. Links to Macao, the
Portuguese colony which reverts to Chinese control in 1999, have also been
held up because Macao plans to establish its own airline in which mainland
Chinese interests are to hold a 40 per cent stake.
For its part, Taipei would like to see flights between Taiwan and China
limited to the existing arrangement under which the semi-official CAL flies
to Hong Kong. At the same time, however, Eva Airways, Taiwan's second
airline, founded by the Evergreen Group in 1991, is seeking access to the
route.
Taiwanese aviation officials said that talks between Cathay and CAL held in
Taipei in late May broke down over whether the lucrative route should be
opened to other carriers. No date for a future meeting has been set.
According to the officials Cathay, citing Chinese government opposition,
opposed changing the route's designation from single to multiple carrier.
Cathay admits to keeping Beijing informed - in particular the Civil Aviation
Authority of China and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office - but denies
it is arguing Beijing's brief at negotiations with CAL.
'We do not want to force through an agreement only to have it torn up after
the change in sovereignty in 1997,' a Cathay official said.
Cathay also denies that it is trying to exclude Eva or other carriers from
gaining access to the route. It points out, however, that Eva has no
standing in the talks between Cathay and CAL, which are renegotiating an
agreement between themselves. A Cathay official said that if Taipei wants
Eva to have access to the Hong Kong-Taipei route, CAL should give up a
portion of its right on the route to Eva.
The case is, in any event, a harbinger of the increasing difficulty Taipei
will face in maintaining its official pretence of no direct political or
economic contacts with Beijing, especially once Hong Kong reverts to Chinese
sovereignty.
Air links with Hong Kong are critical to Taipei, whose fast growing trade
and investment ties with China are mostly routed through the colony because
of Taiwan's long-standing ban on direct cross-strait links. Moreover, the
one-hour Hong Kong-Taipei flight is a cash-cow for Cathay and CAL and is
believed to be one of CAL's few profitable routes. Granting access to other
airlines could dilute profits, depending on scheduling and service.
Another sticking point is that China will undoubtedly refuse to permit CAL's
jets to fly to Hong Kong bearing the national flag of the Republic of China
on Taiwan after Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty. It is likely CAL
will be forced to fly to the colony via its affiliate, Mandarin Airlines,
which it is reluctant to do.
Because of the political sensitivities surrounding these negotiations, their
progress has been shrouded in secrecy. Both governments deny direct
involvement in the talks. That may be true for the time being but, when it
happens, the renewal of the Cathay-CAL air agreement will be political.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Pounds 1.25bn UK package for Pretoria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAULA HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's trade and industry secretary, Mr Michael Heseltine, yesterday
ann-ounced a Pounds 1.25bn 'trade support and assistance package' to South
Africa, which he described as the largest such facility offered by any
country since the South African elections.
The bulk of the package had been available before Mr Heseltine's visit to
South Africa earlier this month, in the form of Export Credit Guarantee
Department cover, ECGD officials said.
The package also included Dollars 60m of bilateral aid and Pounds 30m
channelled through the European Union. A further Pounds 10m will be made
available through the Commonwealth Development Corporation.
Mr Heseltine also announced the launch of a training scheme for
entrepreneurs from Johannesburg's Soweto township. Under the scheme, to be
known as the Soweto Initiative, the entrepreneurs will join British
companies for periods of several months and be trained in management and
other skills.
Participating companies include Rolls-Royce, Samuel Montagu and Wimpey.
The scheme will be funded partly by the Commonwealth Development Corporation
and partly by private organisation.
Mr Heseltine, who returned recently from a six-day visit to South Africa,
said: 'Having witnessed at first hand the ideas bubbling up within the
Sowetan business community, the drive, selling capabilities and sheer
enthusiasm of Sowetan entrepreneurs, we on the mission decided that we could
and should do something to help.'
'These are the business leaders of tomorrow - now is the time to forge
friendships and partnerships with them.'
Mr Heseltine was accompanied by 57 British businessmen on his trip. Up to
Dollars 500m of business could come to British companies from South Africa
as a result of the trade mission, said DTI officials.
