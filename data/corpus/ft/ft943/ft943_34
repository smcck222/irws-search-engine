FT  28 JUL 94 / N Korea 'has made five nuclear bombs': Son-in-law of premier
speaks out after defecting to Seoul, but US casts doubt on claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON

<TEXT>
North Korea has already developed five nuclear bombs and plans to build
more, a senior North Korean defector claimed yesterday.
But the US later disputed this, suggesting the figure was too high.
The defector, Mr Kang Myong-do, a son-in-law of the North Korean prime
minister, said the North's nuclear policy was to make about 10 nuclear bombs
before revealing their existence.
He said the nuclear weapons programme was meant to protect the North against
the US and South Korea.
'By possessing nuclear weapons, North Korea thinks it can be relieved from
security worries and will be able to divert resources from the arms industry
to agriculture and light industry,' he said. This could help rescue the
North's shrinking economy.
Mr Kang arrived in Seoul from China in May but his defection was not
disclosed until yesterday. He appeared at a news conference with Mr Cho
Myong-chol, the son of a former construction minister, who defected last
week.
They are the two most senior North Korean officials to have fled to South
Korea.
Their press conference appears to be part of a renewed propaganda war
between Seoul and Pyongyang following the death of North Korea's President
Kim's Il-sung. It was evidently meant to embarrass the North as it
celebrated Victory Day, marking the end of the Korean war in 1953.
North Korea, which routinely claims defectors have been kidnapped by Seoul,
is likely to react strongly. Increased tension between the two Koreas are
reducing chances of a summit between their leaders after it was postponed on
Mr Kim's death.
Some analysts - and US officials - are sceptical of Mr Kang's claims,
doubting the North's technical capability to assemble nuclear devices as
well as the number of bombs claimed by Kang.
Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, said he stood behind a US
intelligence estimate that North Korea probably had reprocessed enough
plutonium to build one or two nuclear bombs.
US State Department spokesman Mike McCurry conceded there was debate within
intelligence ranks about the 'exact parameters' of the North Korean nuclear
programme. 'But the information provided by this defector falls well beyond
and well outside of those parameters,' he said.
Mr Kang's claim that the North has developed five nuclear bombs was based on
a discussion he had with a senior security official at the Yongbyon nuclear
complex.
The two defectors voiced opposition to Mr Kim Jong-il's assumption of power
after the death of his father, President Kim Il-sung. They said Mr Kim was
in firm control, having exercised extensive administrative powers since
1985. But food shortages and other economic problems threatened his rule,
while the military was divided in its loyalty to him.
Mr Kang said Mr Kim was 'trying his utmost' to postpone international
nuclear inspections until the North made as many nuclear warheads as it
needed. The North saw them as a card in negotiations with the US about
diplomatic recognition and economic aid.
Analysts are interested in the effect of Mr Kang's defection on the future
of Prime Minister Kang Song-san, third-ranking official in the North.

<TEXT>
The International Monetary Fund has recommended an accelerated pace of
reform in India and 'a more vigorous approach to removing structural
weaknesses'.
The IMF annual report presented by its executive board in Washington
yesterday expressed concern about a 'worrisome' rise in prices and
'considerable fiscal slippage in 1993-94, despite a good monsoon.
There was a 'considerable widening of the budget deficit in 1993-94, a
persistence of high domestic interest rates, and a sluggish industrial
recovery, as well as the related surge in capital inflows that had
complicated monetary management and added to inflationary pressures.' The
Fund said 'external viability was not yet assured'.
The Indian government had made progress in 'articulating a broad framework
for structural reform' in core areas like trade, financial sector
liberalisation and tax reform, but 'progress had been slower in
restructuring public enterprises and in increasing the flexibility of
markets for labour and land.'
Commending India for further reductions in import tariffs, the Fund
advocated early action to replace quantitative restrictions on consumer
goods imports with appropriate tariffs. The directors urged the government
to return 'quickly and decisively to the path of fiscal reforms,' with a
'less distortionary and more revenue-elastic tax system' and lower interest
rates to encourage private investment.
More than 54,000 people have fled their villages in the north-east Indian
state of Assam since tribal militants killed some 50 Moslems at the weekend,
senior officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Barpeta, India. The
Indian government sent the army into Barpeta and adjoining districts
following the raid by Bodo militants fighting for their own state within
India.
There have been several outbreaks of such violence in recent years, usually
with the militants attacking Moslems recently arrived from Bangladesh.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Asean to train Cambodia military

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South-east Asian countries and their main trading partners from the
industrialised world yesterday said they wanted to provide military training
to help the fragile Cambodian government in the fight against Khmer Rouge
guerrillas and would eventually consider sending weapons.
At the end of the week-long series of meetings among foreign ministers
hosted by the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean), delegates
said they were concerned by the weakness of the Cambodian coalition. It was
elected last year at the culmination of the Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) UN
peace plan for the country.
Khmer Rouge guerrillas based on the Thai border recently routed government
troops who attempted to seize their strongholds in northern and western
Cambodia.
'France and other countries have provided aid for the army and the police
and this could eventually include deliveries of arms,' Mr Alain Lamassoure,
the French European affairs minister, told a news conference. France has
some 40 military advisers in Cambodia.
Paris and other governments are putting the emphasis on training rather than
material at present because the Cambodian army is undisciplined and soldiers
sell weapons to the guerrillas.
Indonesia and Malaysia yesterday said they were willing to help train the
army. The US says it is considering Cambodia's request for military aid.
Last week Australian military advisers visited Cambodia to assess the
situation.
Thailand was implicitly criticised by several foreign ministers and
officials at the Bangkok meetings for failing to prevent supplies reaching
the Khmer Rouge. Thai leaders say they support the government in Phnom Penh,
but Khmer Rouge guerrillas sell gems and timber to Thai traders on the
frontier and use the money to buy arms.
A senior US official said the US wanted a reaffirmation of support not only
for Phnom Penh but 'for the objective of sealing off the border in terms of
anything that could be construed as assistance to the Khmer Rouge'.
Asean and western governments said they had moved closer together on policy
towards Burma's military junta. Asean members - Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia,
the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand - welcomed Mr Ohn Gyaw, the Burmese
foreign minister, to Bangkok as a guest but they also raised the issue of
human rights.
The European Union, Australia and others remained critical of the junta's
human rights abuses but accepted that their attempts to isolate the regime
had not produced results and that Asean's policy of 'constructive
engagement' could have some merit.

<TEXT>
Attempts to maintain political openness in Indonesia have suffered a further
blow following a Department of Information threat to close leading
newspapers and magazines.
Officials at the Kompas and Sinar Pagi daily newspapers, Sinar magazine, the
English-language daily The Jakarta Post, and Indonesia Business Weekly, an
English-language business magazine, said they had received oral warnings
from the department over the past week. Sinar magazine is owned by Mr
Sudwikatmono, a relative of President Suharto.
The newspapers and magazines said they were taking the warnings seriously.
In June the government forced the closure of two weekly magazines and one
tabloid newspaper following their critical reporting of the government's
acquisition of a fleet of former East German warships.
This time the publications are being tackled over their reporting on recent
demonstrations in East Timor, which turned bloody after military
interference. They were also warned about their reporting of last month's
press ban.
The media bans last month appeared to mark the end of a short-lived era of
fledgling political openness.
'For the time being we have to lie low,' said an editor of one of the
threatened publications. 'I suspect the government is giving a blanket
warning to everyone with these latest warnings, regardless of the nature of
the stories.'

FT  28 JUL 94 / Strike by Nigerian oil workers forces Shell to default on
supplies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The Anglo-Dutch Shell company, Nigeria's largest oil producer, yesterday
declared force majeure on deliveries of crude oil, enabling it to default on
supplies of about 1m barrels of oil per day, half of Nigeria's crude oil
output.
The decision, which means the company does not expect to meet original
loading dates, led to a rise in oil prices. London September futures for the
world benchmark Brent Blend rose to Dollars 17.94 per barrel, up almost 30
cents from Tuesday.
There was also an unconfirmed report of a gas blast in the Nigerian Forcados
field.
Shell took the decision after reviewing the effects on the industry of the
three-week oil workers' strike against military rule. The company was
already three days behind schedule on loadings but says the main effect will
be on August deliveries.
Until yesterday Shell and the other oil companies operating in Nigeria had
managed to keep output at normal levels by deploying non-union staff, mainly
senior managers or expatriates, on essential tasks.
Recent threats of reprisals by the unions against strike-breakers persuaded
Shell to withdraw staff, according to oil experts in Nigeria, halting the
flow of oil to its terminals Bonny and Forcados in the Niger delta.
Chevron and Mobil have not yet declared any lapse in loadings but most
companies say that this is a matter of time.
Oil accounts for more than 90 per cent of Nigeria's exports and the cut in
production deepens the country's financial crisis. Arrears on the Dollars
28bn (Pounds 18bn) of external debt have reached Dollars 8bn. The budget
deficit for the first half of the year was about Dollars 1.5bn, according to
the finance ministry, and non-oil revenue flows have almost dried up since
foreign exchange regulations were imposed in January.
The oil strike is the most serious threat so far to the regime of General
Sani Abacha. Nigeria is expecting a delegation from US President Bill
Clinton, to be led by the Rev Jesse Jackson, to mediate in the political
crisis.
Nigeria is also host to a summit of West African heads of state, postponed
this week until August 5.
The government is under pressure from the oil workers and other unions in
south-west Nigeria to release from jail Mr Moshood Abiola, the banned winner
of last year's annulled presidential election, who is due to face trial
today in Abuja for treason after declaring himself president.
The union demands include the replacement of military rule by a government
formed by Mr Abiola and the repayment of an estimated Dollars 800m owed by
the government to the oil companies.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Australian inflation puts rates rise on hold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Prospects for an immediate increase in Australian interest rates faded
yesterday after publication of the latest consumer price index figures
showed that inflation was running at 0.7 per cent in the June quarter, or an
annualised rate of 1.7 per cent.
The rise in the CPI in the latest quarter was at the lower end of analysts'
forecasts, and the Treasury calculated that the increase in the 'underlying
rate' was smaller still, at about 0.4 per cent in the quarter. During the
April-June period the CPI was held back by deflation in the food sector, and
only modest rises in clothing and household equipment prices.
The data came as a relief to the Australian government which has been
anxious to delay raising interest rates until there are clearer signs that
business investment is picking up. Although the economy is growing at an
annualised rate of 4.5-5 per cent, this has been largely due to a surge in
domestic consumer demand.
There had been fears that, if the CPI data showed that strong domestic
demand was pushing up prices, the government would have been forced to raise
rates - thus choking off the slow improvement in investment levels.
Yesterday, Mr Ralph Willis, Australian treasurer, said that 'excluding fuel,
tobacco and alcohol and mortgage interest charges, inflation for the quarter
was around 0.3 per cent - further evidence of the absence of inflationary
pressures in the economy'.
Mr Willis, who talked to Reserve Bank of Australia officials after returning
from a trip to Washington and New York yesterday, added: 'I don't see a rise
in interest rates as a result of these figures'. He expected 'a good
inflation outcome' in the September quarter. Bond yields and the Australian
dollar both fell on the news.
Nevertheless, most analysts still predict there will be some tightening of
monetary policy before the end of the year.

One of the two rail tunnels Switzerland has proposed drilling through the

competition. Swiss parliamentarians, worried that the SFr27bn (Pounds 13bn)
project would strain government spending later in the decade, have ordered
the federal Transport Ministry to make a fresh study of its viability. The
project, known as Neat (New Alpine Transversal Tunnel), was approved by
Swiss voters in a referendum two years ago and calls for two high-speed rail
tunnels to be built under the Alps to boost north-south goods transport
capacity.

The European Commission yesterday decided not to block aid from the
city-state of Bremen to Klockner Werke's steel mill. It argued that Bremen's
investment in the rescue plan was 'identical' to that of a private investor.
The Commission also ruled that capacity cuts to have been made at Klockner
could be abandoned in exchange for the closure of a subsidiary of Arbed, the
Luxembourg steel maker. Arbed is one of a group of companies which, together
with Bremen, formed a consortium to rescue the bankrupt Klockner steel mill.
The two decisions are likely to be viewed suspiciously by non-subsidised
producers which have argued that the Bremen plan amounted to state aid.

FT  28 JUL 94 / 'PVC cartel' fines reimposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday reimposed fines on 12 chemical companies
for an alleged plastics price-fixing cartel during the early 1980s. This
follows a decision by the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg last June
to overturn fines previously imposed to punish a cartel in polyvinyl
chloride (PVC). The court threw out the fines because of translation
differences between the German, English and French texts of the Commission's
decision on the cartel. The textual differences invalidated the entire legal
process, the court said.
The Commission has reimposed fines totalling Ecu23.5m (Pounds 18.5m) against
BASF, Hoechst, Wacker Chemie, and Huls of Germany; ICI and Shell
International Chemical of the UK; DSM of the Netherlands; Limburgse Vinyl
Maatschappij of Belgium; Enichem and Montedison of Italy; and Elf Atochem
and Societe Artesienne de Vinyl of France.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Standstill on EU labour laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission drew back from recommending any new EU-wide labour
laws in a white paper on social policy published yesterday. The paper,
introduced by social affairs commissioner Padraig Flynn, contained no
specific legislative proposals but will shape the EU social and employment
policy debate until the year 2000. In trying to negotiate a path between
enthusiasts for European-level social policy and sceptics, led by the UK
government, the white paper will disappoint many on both left and right.
The UK said the white paper did not put enough emphasis on labour market
flexibility. Mr Michael Portillo, the new employment secretary, also
stressed the UK would block any attempt to remove its 'opt-out' from some
aspects of social legislation, as enshrined in the Maastricht treaty. The
white paper noted the strong desire of all member states to proceed as 12
where possible and it hopes EU social policy action will 'be founded on a
single legal framework'. Mr Flynn added yesterday that the EU
inter-governmental conference in 1996 should consider ending the UK
'opt-out'.

Bosnian Serbs killed a British UN soldier yesterday in an attack on a UN
convoy using a commercial route into Sarajevo which the Serbs had closed to
put pressure on the United Nations and the Bosnian government in peace
negotiations. The attack came as Mr William Perry, US defence secretary,
warned of 'consequences' for the Serbs if they did not drop their opposition
to the peace plan by Saturday.
Bosnian Serbs opened fire on the convoy, wounding two British soldiers and
one civilian and blowing up a fuel tanker. One of the soldiers was shot in
the chest and died later of his wounds. UN sources said Nato warplanes were
called in but did not fire because they could not identify a target. Lt-Gen
Sir Michael Rose, UN commander in Bosnia, said Serbs had mistook the white
trucks and jeeps, bearing UN markings, for civilian vehicles but a British
officer on the convoy said the UN had been directly targeted. Last night
French forces, who went to recover British vehicles stranded in the attack,
were fired on.

<TEXT>
Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund,
yesterday announced plans for unprecedented co-operation between the new
Ukrainian administration and the IMF in drawing up an economic reform
programme for Ukraine. After meeting the recently elected President Leonid
Kuchma in Kiev, Mr Camdessus said the IMF and the Ukrainian administration
would 'put all of our energies' into the joint writing of the programme in
the next two months. Close co-operation with the IMF could secure swift
issue of the first tranche of a Dollars 700m (Pounds 451.6m) IMF loan,
opening the door to the Dollars 4bn package promised to Ukraine at the
Naples summit of the Group of Seven industrialised nations earlier this
month.
Although an agreement is not guaranteed, IMF and Ukrainian officials are
expected to develop a programme to keep monthly inflation below 10 per cent,
reduce the budget deficit (estimated to run at 30 per cent of GDP this
year), end excessive printing of money and liberalise prices. 'We're talking
of a far-reaching programme,' Mr Camdessus said. But he cautioned that this
kind of programme would require 'ambition' - an attempt to encourage Mr
Kuchma in what is expected to be a bitter struggle with Ukraine's
conservative parliament.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Berlusconi besieged on all fronts: Robert Graham watches the
Italian prime minister lurch from crisis to crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Silvio Berlusconi even a day is beginning to look like a long time in
Italian politics.
The media magnate turned prime minister is stumbling from crisis to crisis
at bewildering speed. A week ago his credibility as a political leader was
in question. Now the fate of his 10-week-old government is at stake.
Besieged on all fronts, Mr Berlusconi is hanging on to power only because
the opposition is weak and no one inside or outside his right-wing coalition
government has come up with an alternative.
The judiciary may yet force his hand as it digs deeper into his Fininvest
media empire. The arrest warrant issued yesterday for his younger brother,
Paolo, on charges of paying bribes to the Guardia di Finanza, the financial
police, to settle tax inspections in key companies belonging to the
Fininvest group, has brought the law perilously close to the prime minister.
Mr Paolo Berlusconi is alleged to have approved payments of L330m (Pounds
137,000) to be handed over to members of the Guardia di Finanza between 1989
and 1992 to ensure friendly inspections.
Mr Berlusconi's 42-year-old brother has faced corruption charges before. In
February he was arrested and admitted to paying some L1bn in bribes on
property sold to the pension fund of Cariplo, the Milan savings bank. He has
already been sent for trial on another charge related to bribes paid on
waste treatment contracts.
The previous charges related to construction business operations which Mr
Paolo Berlusconi has handled since the early 1980s and which were formally
hived off to him two years ago. The new charges concern core Fininvest
companies in publishing, television programme-making and life assurance.
Although Mr Silvio Berlusconi began to withdraw from daily management of
Fininvest last autumn, he did not step down as chairman until January, when
he announced his entry into politics.
In the public eye Mr Paolo Berlusconi has always been seen as the faithful
servant of his high-profile elder brother. Even after Mr Silvio Berlusconi
transferred his newspaper publishing interests to him for anti-trust
reasons, he still called the shots. In the present circumstances, the
problems of his brother will inevitably reflect upon him.
Mr Berlusconi has sought to portray the investigation into Fininvest as a
vendetta conducted by Milan magistrates who have exceeded the bounds of
their authority. The anti-corruption magistrates have undoubtedly behaved
politically - most notably when they threatened to resign on July 14 over
the government's introduction of a controversial decree restricting their
powers of preventive detention. They have also abused these powers of
preventive detention to extract confessions.
But their inquiry into the activities of the Guardia di Finanza in Lombardy
cannot be seen as aimed solely at Fininvest. It is a huge investigation
designed to demonstrate that in a system where companies paid out (willingly
or unwillingly) large sums to secure contracts and to keep the politicians
happy, these moneys had to be accounted for in company balance sheets.
So far more than 50 prominent businessmen, accountants and tax experts have
been arrested as well as more than 20 members of the Guardia di Finanza.
Three members of the corps have committed suicide in the past month.
Mr Berlusconi has found cross-party support in his worries about a
confrontation between the executive and the legislature on the one hand and
the judiciary on the other. The opposition ex-communist Party of the
Democratic Left (PDS) was even critical of the Milan magistrates' threat to
resign over the preventive detention decree.
But his position has been seriously undermined by the patent conflict of
interest. The prime minister cannot attack the Milan magistrates and appear
disinterested. Matters have been made worse by the ill conceived meeting he
held at his Arcore villa near Milan on Sunday.
Present as 'friends' were Mr Gianni Letta, former deputy chairman of
Fininvest and currently his chief of staff; Mr Ceseare Previtti, his former
Fininvest lawyer and now defence minister; Mr Fidele Confalonieri, the
chairman of Fininvest; his brother Paolo and, at least for part of the time,
the latter's lawyers along with the lawyer of the head of Fininvest's tax
department against whose client an arrest warrant was outstanding.
Conflict of interest lies at the heart of the present crisis as it limits
the credibility of almost every action by Mr Berlusconi. Is he seeking to
help Italy or protect himself when he seeks to reform the RAI, the state
broadcasting corporation? Is he trying to guarantee individual rights or
insulate his friends and family when he introduces a decree on preventive
detention? Was the meeting at Arcore a harmless Sunday gathering of old
cronies or a council of war involving key ministers directed against the
Milan magistrates?
It is argueably too late to undo the damage and achieve a satisfactory
separation of his ownership of Fininvest from his role as prime minister.
His TV interests are too interwoven with those of RAI to permit any sale
without a concurrent reform of the entire system of Italian TV.
In the short term he can survive as early elections suit nobody. The
opposition is weak and undecided. The PDS has just acquired a new leader, Mr
Massimo D'Alema, who has yet to establish himself within his own party. The
PDS is divided between those who want to see Mr Berlusconi even more
thoroughly discredited (and so politically finished) and those who want to
cut a deal with the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi.
A PDS-League alliance backed by former Christian Democrat deputies in the
centre could form a government. But the PDS is wary of the League as an
ally. The League meanwhile is pretending to be loyal to Mr Berlusconi,
anxious to avoid being seen as catalyst for bringing down the government.
This suggests the government will try to limp through until the summer break
and then hope for a change of a fortune in the autumn: a bleak scenario at
best and profoundly unsettling for the financial markets.

</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has told his ministers and diplomats that
France should try to delay decisions on any European Union legislation until
its national parliament has pronounced on it.
Mr Balladur's initiative has come in the form of a recent circular to all
French civil servants.
It is a further sign of his determination to step up the defence of French
interests in the EU - following gains by anti-Maastricht parties in last
month's European parliament elections.
According to French parliamentary officials, French ministers and diplomats
in future will behave more like their UK counterparts in Brussels, rather
than the Danes.
UK representatives frequently 'reserve' their position in debates in the
Council of Ministers pending 'scrutiny' of issues by the House of Commons.
Danish ministers, however, are formally bound by their parliament in
decisions on EU legislation.
Nevertheless, Mr Balladur's circular of July 18 could delay decisions by the
Council of Ministers. This would reverse the traditional French priority for
speed and efficiency over democracy in EU law-making.
The circular says ministers and officials must check whether the French
parliament intends to pass a resolution on a draft EU law due for debate at
EU Council meetings, and if so, France will try to get the item bounced off
the Council agenda.
Last month the French employment minster was criticised by French MPs for
approving the EU directive on works councils before parliament had time to
have its say.
The French National Assembly is handicapped, as it is a part-time
legislature, sitting only half the year, while the only month EU Council
meetings are not held is August. But the Assembly has a 36-member EU affairs
committee that sits more regularly.
Mr Balladur has also decided to become the first French prime minister to
chair the government's inter-ministerial committee on European issues.
In addition, Mr Alain Lamassoure, his EU affairs minister, has instituted
regular monthly meetings with France's 87 MEPs.
They are now scattered among seven different groups at Strasbourg. Oblivious
to the fact that these groups are created precisely to reflect MEPs'
differing ideologies rather than nationalities, the government worries that
fragmention of the country's Euro-representatives means 'France's voice'
will not be properly heard at Strasbourg.
In line, too, with his reversion to the old Gaullist dictum that European
Commissioners are essentially technocrats to be kept under ministers'
political control, Mr Balladur is contemplating nominating a senior
official, Mr Yves-Thibault de Silguy, to the Brussels executive.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Economic Watch: W German inflation declines
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
West German inflation resumed its slow decline during July, dropping to 2.9
per cent from 3 per cent in June, according to preliminary figures issued
yesterday. The fall, which came later than expected because of unusually
sharp fluctuations in summer food prices, is now forecast to continue in
September after a standstill in August. Economists predict a 2.5 per cent
rate by the end of the year. Fresh data from the engineering sector
yesterday showed a real 26 per cent increase in demand for German machinery
and plant during June. Foreign orders surged 44 per cent above year-earlier
levels, while bookings from domestic customers rose 11 per cent, the VDMA
industry association said. While the month's figures indicate continuing
economic recovery in the industry's main export markets in the European
Union - where demand was up 34 per cent - they may have been distorted by
bookings of unusually large contracts. However, orders in the first six
months of this year were 10 per cent higher than in the same period of 1993,
the association said. Export demand was up 19 per cent while German orders
rose only 1 per cent. Christopher Parkes, Frankfurt
French household spending on manufactured goods rose 0.3 per cent in June
after falling a revised 1.1 per cent in May, the national statistics
institute, Insee, said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday agreed on further steps to speed up
integration of central and eastern Europe into the European Union, including
changes in the Common Agricultural Policy and a possible softening of
anti-dumping measures against cheap imports.
The proposals are meant to signal that the EU is serious about building a
'wider Europe'. The goal is to submit a substantial package of measures to
the European summit in Essen in December. Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade
negotiator, said the Commission paper offered faster liberalisation of
east-west trade, more financial aid, and practical steps to allow central
and east Europeans to adopt progressively the EU's economic and legal
system.
The paper is the result of a review of trade, aid and competition policy and
the operation of the CAP toward the six 'associate' EU member states:
Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania.
Among the proposals are:
A timetable for harmonising legislation and technical rules to achieve
common European standards covering each EU aspirant.
A single authority in each associate country to monitor and control state
aid, and to prepare an inventory of state aid with the Commission. A pledge
to inform any associate member before launching anti-dumping or safeguard
clauses against cheap imports. The Commission favours 'a clear preference
for price undertakings rather than anti-dumping duties'. Though carefully
worded, a pledge to review the EU's farm exports to eastern Europe 'to
address any serious imbalance in east-west trade'. The paper notes eastern
farm exports, particularly livestock, slumped from a surplus in 1990 to a
deficit of Ecu433m (Pounds 340m) in the first 11 months of 1993.
An overhaul of the Phare aid programme which has pumped more than Ecu1bn of
technical aid into eastern Europe in the past four years. Officials want
multi-annual programmes, and an end to the condition that no more than 15
per cent of the Phare budget can fund trans-European networks, the huge
east-west road and rail programmes.
The Commission also believes funding for the EU's programme to aid eastern
Europe should be guaranteed over the next five years. Speeding up trade
concessions to Bulgaria and Romania to bring them into line with other east
European countries. Sofia and Bucharest would be granted free trade in
industrial goods by 1995, in steel by 1996 and in textiles by 1997.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Brussels approves aid for airlines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday formally cleared the way for the French
and Greek governments to rescue their beleaguered state airlines from
collapse through big capital injections, prompting dismay among Europe's
private airlines.
British Airways, the private UK carrier, said it was considering challenging
a decision to allow a FFr20bn (Pounds 2.4bn) payment to Air France in the
European Court of Justice while Mr Brian Mawhinney, the UK transport
minster, said the decision would 'distort competition in European aviation
and work against the interests of all European consumers'.
The Commission also approved a rescue plan for Greece's Olympic Airways,
involving a capital injection of Dr54bn (Pounds 147m) of state funds. The
decision, seen as a test case in Europe's efforts to liberalise air
transport, comes in spite of a commitment by EU governments to create a fair
and open single market.
The French government expressed satisfaction with the decision to grant the
aid. It follows a humiliating climbdown by Paris in October last year after
a strike at the state-owned airline. Approval of the capital increase was a
central element in winning staff support for the restructuring package drawn
up by Mr Christian Blanc, the chairman.
Mr Bernard Bosson, the French transport minister, said Commission conditions
attached to the decision were balanced. 'They do not impose any unjustified
constraints on the national carrier,' he said.
However, Sir Michael Bishop, chairman of British Midland, said he found it
'quite extraordinary that the Commission can allow Air France to receive a
sum almost equal to the total losses made by all of the world's airlines in
1993'.
Sir Colin Marshall, the chairman of British Airways, said there was 'no
justification for a subsidy of this size and the conditions imposed are
wholly inadequate. Air France is once again being protected from the forces
of competition.'
Mr Marcelino Oreja, transport commissioner in Brussels, said the aid,
together with conditions, would ensure that the company was viable and fit
for privatisation by the end of the three-year restructuring.
But Air France said the capital injection approved by Brussels was a
necessary but not sufficient condition for recovery. 'We have to push ahead
with our restructuring plan quickly,' said a spokesman. The plan aims to
raise productivity by 30 per cent by 1997, cut 5,000 jobs from the airline's
workforce of 40,000 and freeze salaries and promotions.
Air France was also ordered to repay an earlier government loan of FFr1.5bn,
considered incompatible with EU competition rules. The government said it
would appeal.
Under the conditions, Air France must formally separate itself from its
domestic carrier Air Inter to ensure the aid goes only to Air France. The
aid must not be used to acquire new stakes in other airlines, nor to
increase the size of its fleet above 146 during restructuring. Nor can the
company increase the seats it has on offer within the European Economic Area
beyond the level reached last year.
The Commission is also demanding that Air France limit its traffic growth to
2.7 per cent per year and that it sell assets including its Meridien luxury
hotels chain. In addition, Orly airport must be opened to competing
airlines.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michele Tedeschi, former chief executive of Iri, the state holding, was
brought back yesterday in a surprise move to head the huge group that has
debts of over L70,000bn (Pounds 28.97bn), writes Robert Graham in Rome.
The appointment came after intense political wrangling among the main
partners in the right-wing coalition government that has delayed a choice
for almost two months. It represents a technocratic compromise which will
give an important signal of the Berlusconi government's commitment to
privatise as much of Iri's diversified activities as possible.
The 44-year-old Mr Tedeschi returns to Iri after only 14 months absence to
replace Prof Romano Prodi, who resigned in May when the Berlusconi
government took office. Mr Tedeschi was appointed to act as chief executive
in 1992 when Iri was converted into a public company with the Treasury as
single shareholder.
Mr Tedeschi returns as chairman, heading a six-man board that includes Mr
Mario Draghi, director-general of the Treasury, who has played a key role
over the past 18 months while the holding has begun to sell off bank
interests.
He comes from being managing director of Stet, the national telecoms
utility. His choice should help rationalise the management of the
fast-changing Italian telecommunications business. Only yesterday the
complex merger was signed bringing together five elements in Iri's telecom
interests to form Telecom Italia.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Russians riot as share pyramid begins to totter: John Lloyd
assesses the impact of the MMM crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The threatened collapse of a pyramid selling share company in Moscow is
pitting the newly awakened forces of consumerism against the widely
distrusted Russian authorities, calling into question the self-image of
post-Soviet man and causing riots in Moscow and St Petersburg.
MMM, a company which, since the beginning of this year has promised, and to
many delivered, wealth through the simple purchase of shares - whose face
value has risen from Rbs500 to over this past weekend Rbs115,000 - as far as
is known owns nothing and invests in nothing. The 'shares' are quoted on no
exchange, and rise by fiat of MMM and its director, Mr Sergei Mavrodi. It is
a financial pyramid and it appears to have reached its apex.
The shares were promoted in television campaigns. Created by Mr Bakhyt
Kilibayev, a Kazakh film director, they feature the working class Golubkov
family which enriches itself through MMM. From modest beginnings, the
Golubkovs rise to the possibility of a Parisian holiday  - 'after all, why
not?' says Lenya (Leonid) G to his wife Marina Sergeyevna, in a phrase which
has become a slogan of the times.
The 'high ups' began to rumble disapproval. Mr Yeltsin said recently 'Lenya
is getting on my nerves' - a reaction which the daily Izvestiya said
insulted the millions of Lenyas who wanted a little of the good life that
the president had secured for himself.
Last Friday - a black one for MMM - a triple salvo was fired from the
finance ministry, the anti-monopoly ministry and the tax inspectorate,
alleging widespread abuses by MMM both centrally and in two Russian cities,
and non-payment of nearly Rbs50bn in taxes.
MMM's reaction was instant and incandescent. Mr Sergei Brish, an MMM
spokesman, said the company was not liable for taxes - and that documents
called for by the government had been prepared and despatched in a van to
the tax department but were unfortunately stolen en route.
In outraged letters published in the press, Mr Mavrodi took up the loftiest
of ground. The 'high-ups', he said, did not like popular enrichment. If the
'high-ups' were against them, then they would rise against the authorities
to start a revolution of shareholders.
The shareholders are beginning to revolt, but not yet against the
government. They want their money. Immediately after the flurry of
government warnings, the black market price for MMM shares - selling at the
end of last week for Rbs105,000 - dipped to Rbs40,000.
MMM closed most of its 60 Moscow and 76 regional buying and selling points -
but took advertising space to claim the difficulties were temporary and the
share price would be hiked up to Rbs115,000 - and on Monday opened up again
and appeared to calm the gathering panic, as the black market price soared
once more.
But on Thursday, it dipped again and the selling points closed. Crowds began
gathering at No. 26 Varshavskoe Chaussee in southern Moscow - the only point
where shares could be sold - and round the MMM branch office in St
Petersburg. By yesterday evening, some 10,000-15,000 people were gathered
round the Varshavskoe office, and MMM had called for riot police.
The crowd was indeed aroused: at the front, there was pushing against the
police lines and evident anger. Said one shareholder, Mr Vassily Karpov - a
pensioner - 'I bought 20 shares three months ago when they cost Rbs28,000
and I was going to take a holiday in Sochi (on the Black Sea). It's all I
have.' However, another, Ms Elena Truvin, said: 'I think most of us still
support MMM because they haven't let us down. The government did all this by
their stupidity.'
Of Mr Mavrodi nothing is known. MMM released a statement yesterday saying
that its points would re-open as soon as the police could guarantee the
safety of the money delivered to them.
In the weekly Soversheno Sekretno an anonymous psychologist opined that
Lenya Golubkov had changed the image of the average Russian from that of an
obedient worker to an Oblomov - the hero of Goncharov's 19th century novel,
who spends all day on a couch dreaming of wealth but incapable of earning
it.

FT  28 JUL 94 / 'PVC cartel' fines reimposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday reimposed fines on 12 chemicals companies
for an alleged plastics price-fixing cartel during the early 1980s. The move
followed a decision last June by the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg
to overturn fines previously imposed to punish a cartel in polyvinyl
chloride (PVC). The court threw out the fines because of translation
differences between the German, English and French texts of the Commission's
decision on the cartel. The textual differences invalidated the entire legal
process, the court said. The Commission has reimposed fines worth a total of
Ecu23.5m (Pounds 18.5m) against BASF, Hoechst, Wacker Chemie, and Huls of
Germany; Imperial Chemical Industries and Shell International Chemical of
the UK; DSM of the Netherlands; Limburgse Vinyl Maatschappij of Belgium;

affected by the court's decision. ICI said yesterday it would be appealing.
The Commission alleges a cartel was started at the end of 1980. Delegates
from the companies met on a monthly basis, normally in Zurich, when they
discussed quotas, monthly sales in each country, and pan-European prices.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Brussels treads water on labour policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission drew back from recommending any new EU-wide labour
laws in a white paper on social policy it published yesterday.
The paper, introduced by social affairs commissioner Mr Padraig Flynn,
contained no specific legislative proposals, but it will shape the EU social
and employment policy debate until the year 2000.
In attempting to negotiate a path between the enthusiasts for European-level
social policy and the sceptics, led by the UK government, the white paper
will disappoint many on both left and right.
Ms Pauline Green, leader of the dominant Socialist group in the European
parliament, said she welcomed the 'firm commitment to ongoing social policy
at European level but we are disappointed that there will be no new
initiatives to safeguard and support working people'.
The UK government said the white paper did not place sufficient emphasis
upon labour market flexibility. Mr Michael Portillo, the UK's new employment
secretary, also stressed that the UK would block any attempt to remove its
'opt-out' from some aspects of social legislation, as enshrined in the
Maastricht treaty.
The white paper noted the strong desire of all member states to proceed as
12 wherever possible and it hopes that Union social policy action will once
again 'be founded on a single legal framework'. Mr Flynn added yesterday
that the European Union's inter-governmental conference planned for 1996
should consider ending the UK 'opt-out'.
There is, however, much that will appeal to the UK and other governments
with reservations about social regulations. There is a stress on leaving
more decisions in this field to national governments, on switching from
passive to active labour market assistance, and about balancing decent
working conditions with sufficient labour market flexibility to create jobs.
The paper says that greater emphasis must be placed on improving job
mobility within the EU and on implementing social directives. Italy has
implemented only 57 per cent of the relevant legislation, compared with 92
per cent in Britain and Portugal (see table).
Above all, the paper stresses that 'given the solid base of European social
legislation that has already been achieved, the Commission considers that
there is not a need for a wide ranging programme of new legislative
proposals in the coming period'.
But the paper is not without hope for the many strong supporters of
expanding social legislation within the EU. 'The pursuit of high social
standards should not be seen only as a cost but also as a key element in the
competitive formula', says the paper.
It emphasises the importance of passing directives that are currently under
discussion on workers posted to other EU countries and on rights for
part-timers. The paper also proposes a high level committee on the future of
the social charter and on job mobility; a new action programme on equality
between men and women and on health and safety; a new EU law against racism;
and the establishment of social rights in the constitution of the EU.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Italian arrest warrant hits lira and stocks: PM's brother
accused of bribery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   ROME

<TEXT>
The issuing of an arrest warrant on corruption charges against Mr Paolo
Berlusconi, the younger brother of Italy's prime minister, provoked extreme
nervousness on financial markets yesterday about the future of the
Berlusconi government.
The country was swept by rumours that Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime
minister, was ready to resign. Although the prime minister's spokesman
denied the rumours, the lira fell below its psychological floor of L1,000
against the D-Mark to L1,005 in late trading.
The Milan bourse fell 2 per cent, almost the same amount as the previous
day, and dealers marked down prices of government bonds as foreign investors
continued to reduce their exposure.
In parliament, opposition and some government members called for an
emergency debate on the growing confrontation between the rightwing
coalition and the judiciary, headed by the anti-corruption magistrates in
Milan. The prime minister's Fininvest media empire is at the centre of their
investigations.
Mr Massimo D'Alema, the newly elected leader of the former communist Party
of the Democratic Left, the main opposition grouping, claimed the government
was at a turning point. He warned there would be a crisis unless Mr
Berlusconi was able to separate clearly his role as prime minister from that
as owner of Fininvest.
After a day of uncertainty over his whereabouts, lawyers for Mr Paolo
Berlusconi last night said he would hand himself over to answer charges of
paying L330m (Pounds 136,000) in bribes to officials of the Guardia di
Finanza, the financial police, who have been inspecting the Fininvest
company books.
Mr Salvatore Sciascia, the head of Fininvest's tax department, admitted on
Monday to handling such payments but claimed the money and authority to pay
the bribes had come from Mr Paolo Berlusconi.
Milan magistrates in signing the arrest warrant said he should be held in
detention because there was a risk of tampering with evidence. They cited as
significant the meeting held on Sunday by Mr Silvio Berlusconi at his villa
near Milan attended by his close government aides, all formerly linked to
Fininvest.
It also emerged yesterday that Mr Paolo Berlusconi was at this meeting,
which has provoked a row over the conflicting roles of Mr Silvio Berlusconi
as prime minister and his continued ownership of Fininvest.
Mr Berlusconi sought to put a brave face on his difficulties. At one stage
he told correspondents who asked him about his brother: 'I don't want to
concern myself with these things . . . But I can tell you that if all the
companies were run like Fininvest, there wouldn't be any problems of public
morality in Italy.'
A poll published yesterday, commissioned by the state broadcasting
organisation's main radio station, revealed that 70 per cent of those who
voted in March for Mr Berlusconi and his Forza Italia movement would still
vote the same way today. The one third who had lost confidence in him spread
their preferences fairly evenly, with most favouring rightwing coalition
partners.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Police put guard on 100 Jewish sites after bombings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain introduced an around-the-clock armed police guard on more than 100
prominent Jewish sites yesterday after two bomb attacks in London heightened
concerns about a global terrorist campaign. Extra security precautions were
also being taken in several cities including Paris and New York.
The UK measure, which included rigidly enforced parking restrictions, was
aimed at preventing a repetition of an attack on Tuesday against the Israeli
embassy and another early yesterday at the headquarters of a Jewish charity.
Israel yesterday urged governments around the world to step up security. In
London, Mr Yehuda Milo, deputy director-general of the Israeli foreign
ministry, accused the UK of having ignored requests for additional security
after the July 18 bomb attack on the Jewish community building in Buenos
Aires which killed at least 96 people.
Mr Azriel Nevo, the Israeli military attache in London, described the second
London bomb as a 'true blunder by local security forces'. The bombed
building, headquarters of the Joint Israel Appeal, was temporarily without
police protection.
The London bombs, which caused injuries and property damage but no deaths,
followed the signing in Washington of a co-operation agreement between
Israel and Jordan. Israeli officials say extremist groups are attempting to
disrupt the Middle East peace process.
In Beirut yesterday, Lebanon's pro-Iranian Hizbollah denied any involvement
in the Buenos Aires and London attacks. Similar denials were issued by
Hamas, the Islamic resistance movement, in Damascus.
The Foreign Office last night said investigations into the attacks were 'at
an early stage'. 'We do not have clear evidence as to who is responsible',
an official said. Sir Paul Condon, commissioner of the Metropolitan Police,
warned of an unprecedented threat from radical Islamic terrorism. He said:
'The new dimension for us is the power and ferocity of the devices being put
down and the total disregard of the terrorists involved for their own or
anybody else's lives.'
Israel's UN envoy Mr Gad Yaacobi last night said he expected the security
council to 'declare all-out war' against terrorism after talks due tomorrow.
Mr Fernando Petrella, Argentina deputy foreign minister, said his country
was 'seriously reconsidering our diplomatic relations' with Iran following
the Buenos Aires bomb.
Intelligence officials in Buenos Aires said an Argentine investigative
magistrate had taken evidence in Caracas from a dissident Iranian diplomat
which suggested that Tehran and possibly Syria offered logistical support to
the terrorist attack.
Mr Uzi Baram, Israel's tourism minister, attributed the bombings to Islamic
fundamentalist groups bent on wrecking Middle East peace moves.

FT  28 JUL 94 / AZT cuts risk of HIV being passed to babies, say studies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Transmission from mother to child of HIV, the virus which causes Aids, can
be significantly reduced by giving both AZT, Wellcome's controversial drug,
according to the results of two independent trials to be presented today to
US regulators.
The studies, showing that AZT can cut transmission rates by up to 67.5 per
cent, will be put before the anti-viral drugs advisory committee of the US
Food and Drug Administration, which must decide whether to recommend the
drug for use on infants.
The trials' results are a boost for the reputation of AZT. This was
tarnished following last year's Anglo-French Concorde trial which questioned
the effectiveness of the drug in HIV-positive people who did not have Aids
symptoms.
The larger trial, conducted in the US and France, involved 477 HIV-positive
women, of whom 364 finished the study. About half were given AZT at between
14 and 38 weeks of pregnancy. The drug was also administered intravenously
to the mothers during delivery and to the infants for six weeks after birth.
Of the 180 women given AZT, only 13 of their children were HIV-positive,
compared with 40 children from the 184 mothers who were not given the drug.
Although AZT has a reputation for being toxic, the trial indicated there
were no statistically significant foetal malformations and non-reversible
side-effects. Similar results were shown in a study of 63 women in Los
Angeles.
The trials' conclusions will raise significant public health issues. The
Center for Disease Control, the Atlanta-based US government organisation, is
expected to use next month's Yokohama International Aids conference to
recommend universal, although not mandatory, screening for HIV among
pregnant women.
Conference organisers expect the trials to be the most important and
controversial studies presented there. Health authorities will have to
decide what should be done when HIV-positive women refuse to take AZT,
possibly endangering their unborn children.
Dr Catherine Peckham, professor of paediatric epidemiology at the Institute
of Child Health in London, said: 'This will add pressure for mandatory
screening in the US. These trials are hugely exciting and an important
breakthrough, but it would be wrong to rush through unconsidered policy
changes. Further trials are required to look at the long-term effects of the
drug.'
In the US, about 100,000 women of child-bearing age are HIV-positive and
7,000 HIV-positive infants are born every year. In inner London, one in 390
pregnant mothers is HIV-positive. About 15 per cent of those with the virus
will infect their children.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Major vows to limit role of state: Prime minister seeks to
counter threat from new Labour leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major last night promised fresh limits on the role of the state and
an expansion of individual ownership as he moved to counter the threat to
the Conservatives posed by Mr Tony Blair's election as Labour leader.
In a lecture marking out the political 'clear water' between the
Conservative and Labour parties, Mr Major said the government would use the
second half of the present parliament to break down barriers between public
and private sectors.
Among a range of initiatives, he pledged a significant expansion of the
government's private finance initiative and a drive to reduce the number of
bureaucrats in the National Health Service. Whitehall departments would be
required to demonstrate in the annual public spending round they had
explored the option of private sector participation in particular projects.
The government would press ahead with privatisation, although Mr Major was
careful not to commit himself in advance of the present consultations to the
disposal of the Royal Mail.
Responding to the mounting criticism of management structures in the health
service, he said legislation in the next parliamentary session would strip
some layers of bureaucracy by abolishing regional authorities.
In a wide-ranging speech, Mr Major signalled that the government intended to
make its commitment to constitutional stability a key part of the political
battleground in the approach to the next general election.
Without mentioning explicitly Labour's plans for devolved government, Mr
Major said he opposed changes in the constitutional settlement holding
together England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
His comments, in an address to the European Policy Forum in London, were the
first detailed response to Mr Blair's promise to take Labour further into
the political middle ground. The Labour leader was not mentioned by name but
his policies were rejected at several points in the speech.
Mr Blair has shaped a political approach based on giving an active role to
the state and local communities in promoting individual opportunity.
But Mr Major said: 'I want people to have ownership of more of their lives,
not just have things allocated as the state sees fit. Ownership and choice
are essential to put power in the hands of people rather than the state.'
That extension of individual decision-making would be put alongside a
revolution in the way public services were delivered: 'As our reforms
advance, the boundary between public and private is open country which an
enabling government can scour for the best ways of using limited taxpayers'
money'.
Mr Major reaffirmed the Conservatives' commitment to a reduction in income
taxes, pledging an extension of the 20p band as soon as the government's
finances allowed. Hinting that the first priority was to help improve
incentives at the lower end of the income scale, he said: 'Our ambitions to
limit taxes on the least well off are far from satisfied.'
The speech was seen at Westminster as a clear attempt by Mr Major to
capitalise on the recent upturn in his political fortunes by offering a
clear prospectus around which his party can unite at its autumn annual
conference.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Adia, the Swiss temporary employment agency group controlled by Mr Klaus
Jacobs, returned to profit in the first half following two years of losses.
It raised the forecast net income for the full year to SFr20m (Dollars
14.3m).
Mr John Bowmer, chief executive, said net income in the first half reached
SFr8.3m compared with a loss of SFr31.6m in the same period last year. Total
revenues rose 10 per cent to SFr1.65bn, reflecting a similar rise in hours
sold.
Improving demand for temporary help in continental Europe was a sign of the
beginning of an economic recovery. Revenues and profits continued to grow in
the US, Australia and the UK, he said.
Mr Bowmer forecast in April that 1994 net income would reach SFr5m after
losses of SFr127m in 1993 and SFr219m in 1992.
Meanwhile, Adia said it had suspended negotiations on acquiring the 19 per
cent of Adia Services, its quoted US subsidiary, which it does not already
own.
It had been unable to reach agreement with a special committee of the US
subsidiary's board on terms.

FT  27 JUL 94 / World Bank attacked for backing Nyerere
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DAR ES SALAAM, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
World Bank loans exceeding Dollars 1bn to Tanzania in the 1960s and 1970s
helped sustain a 'poorly thought out socialist experiment', according to a
confidential internal report drawn up by the agency.
The two-volume analysis of relations between the World Bank and Tanzania
between 1961 and 1987 is highly critical of the support for former President
Julius Nyerere's socialist programme launched in 1967.
The report, obtained by the Financial Times, is still confidential,
according to World Bank officials yesterday, though they said this may be
reviewed in the light of the bank's new disclosure of information policy.
Mr Nyerere nationalised the country's industries, and some 14m peasants and
their families were compulsorily regrouped in 'ujamaa', or collective,
villages in an effort to make water, health and education more accessible.
But the badly planned exercise disrupted agricultural production.
Since independence in 1961, the bank and other donors have provided nearly
Dollars 16bn in aid. The largest single contributor has been the bank, while
Sweden, Denmark and Norway have together provided Dollars 3bn. Scandinavian
countries have been among the largest bilateral donors.
The hitherto unpublished report, although compiled in 1990, five years after
Mr Nyerere retired, throws new light on about the donors' share of
responsibility for Tanzania's economic decline.
Many of the issues raised, including problems of aid co-ordination,
effective utilisation of assistance, and donor reluctance to disclose policy
failures, continue to characterise current efforts to tackle Africa's
development crisis. The document suggests that what it sees as Mr Nyerere's
well meaning but impractical socialist vision was indulged by senior bank
officials. Mr Robert McNamara, the former US secretary of state, was bank
president from 1968 to 1981, most of the period covered by the report.
The report criticises what it calls a 'stance of uncritical support for
government policies' adding: 'Even where risks were noted, the board
consistently reiterated that it was the bank's role to be at the forefront
of social innovation and change, supporting new approaches to development
even at the risk of failure.
'The bank's practice of choosing to accept and not to influence the
development path led to considerable difficulty when the bank then sought to
restablish some influence in the eighties.'
The report adds:
'The bank accepted Tanzania's road to socialism enunciated in 1967 as a fait
accompli.' Since 1967 and at least until 1980 the bank had viewed Tanzania
'as coming close to being a model developing country.'

FT  27 JUL 94 / Ford joins 'hybrid' electric car project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford is joining seven US-based advanced technology companies in a five-year,
Dollars 122m programme to develop prototype 'hybrid' electric vehicles.
Such vehicles are seen as possibly the best available compromise between the
need to reduce exhaust emissions, best achieved by electrically powered
vehicles, and the severely restricted range offered by battery cars using
current technology .
Half the funds for the project are to be provided by the US energy
department.
'Hybrids' contain two power units; one, typically a small petrol engine,
runs at a constant speed to generate electrical energy which is either
stored in battery packs for electric-only operation in cities or converted
by the second motor directly into mechanical energy for use on highways.
Ford said last night the project aimed to investigate methods of using
alternative fuels as well as increasing fuel economy and reducing emissions.
Ford's partners in the project include GE's research and development centre,
which will explore energy storage in the vehicles; and Minneapolis-based
Onan Corporation, one of the world's largest producers of mobile power
generation systems.
The project comes against a background of increasing hostility by the North
American motor industry towards stringent anti-pollution standards being
introduced in California.
These require carmakers to have at least 2 per cent of their sales made up
of 'zero-emission' (battery-powered) cars from 1998.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Washington fights to save crime bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEREMY KAHN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The White House and Congress are working feverishly to salvage the crime
bill, which is stalled amid bitter disputes over race, the death penalty and
a proposed ban on assault weapons.
The proposed, multi-faceted law passed the Senate and House in varying forms
last spring but has been held up for weeks in a joint House-Senate
conference committee. After a week's postponement, the committee was due to
meet yesterday for what could be final negotiations.
If the committee does not this week release a bill which both chambers of
Congress can pass, it is unlikely to be enacted this year, dealing a big
blow to the Clinton administration.
President Bill Clinton met leaders of the influential congressional Black
Caucus yesterday to try to work out a compromise on a provision in the House
version that would allow defendants to use statistics to challenge the death
penalty as racially biased.
Backers of the provision say the death penalty is applied disproportionately
to black people.
The Senate version of the bill does not contain this provision, and Senate
Republicans have threatened a filibuster to kill any crime bill that
includes 'racial justice' provisions.
The White House initially favoured the so-called Racial Justice Act but has
since retreated in the face of fierce Senate opposition, outraging the Black
Caucus, whose votes may be essential to passing the crime bill in the House.
The administration last week offered a compromise: Mr Clinton would sign an
executive order mandating federal prosecutors to consider race in death
penalty cases and appointing a commission to study the problem.
But the Black Caucus baulked at the deal, vowing to fight on. It was not
clear whether the meeting yesterday with Mr Clinton had changed their minds.
Also causing trouble for the bill is a proposed ban on 19 kinds of assault
weapons. The ban passed both the House and Senate, but is adamantly opposed
by the Mr Jack Brooks, House chairman of the conference committee, who has
attempted to weaken the ban.
Many gun control advocates in both Congressional houses think the ban has
the votes to pass in the final version of the bill. They feel the conference
committee should not attempt to compromise with Mr Brooks, but the latter
could further stall the crime bill in the committee, increasing the chances
time will run out for it this year.
The White House is eager to get a bill onto the floor of Congress this week
to clear the decks for health care reform.

<TEXT>
More than 300 Spanish trawlers yesterday sealed off entry to the main
domestic northern ports and also to the harbour of the French border town of
Hendaye in protest against EU regulations over the use of drift nets. The
blockade, which affected both the important industrial port of Bilbao and
the port of Santander, a main entry point for tourist-laden ferries from
Britain and France, marked an escalation in a running 'tuna war' between
Spanish and French fishermen. Last week the Spanish trawler fleet boarded a
French vessel at sea and towed it back to its home port where the local
authorities established that it had been using 5km-long drift nets, twice
the length permitted by EU regulations. In retaliation, the French navy
impounded a Spanish trawler which was subsequently fined for taking
undersize fish. Spain's trawler fleet said it would continue its protest
until the EU took firm action against the use of oversize nets.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Russia agrees troops pullout from Estonia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The presidents of Russia and Estonia yesterday signed an agreement under
which the remaining 2,000 Russian troops in Estonia will leave by August 31
 -marking the last and hardest won of such agreements between Russia and the
three former Soviet republics in the Baltics.
If adhered to, it will mean that by the end of the summer all Russian
divisions will have been pulled back from the three countries which they
have occupied, in Soviet or Russian form, for 50 years. They have already
left Lithuania and are leaving Latvia - though the Baltfax news agency
reported yesterday that Mr Sergey Zotov, the Russian negotiator, had
expressed 'serious concern' that the Latvian parliament had not ratified the
pullout agreement.
The negotiation process - especially in the case of Estonia, the smallest of
the three republics - has been protracted, bad-tempered and mutually
recriminatory, with the main western states all putting pressure on Russia
to observe the August 31 date. Moscow had put this in doubt because of fears
that the rights of the Russian speakers in the Baltic states were being
violated.
A brief statement to the official news agency Tass said that 'the presidents
of Russia and Estonia signed an agreement today that the rights of the
Russian military pensioners would be respected equally to the rights of
Estonian citizens. They also signed an agreement in accordance with which
Russian troops are withdrawn from Estonia before August 31'. Russia's
president Boris Yeltsin, emerging after six hours of talks with his
counterpart, President Lennart Meri - with whom he has never found any
rapport - commented that the negotiations were 'pretty hard'.
The formula appears to mean that the Estonian side will pay pensions and
offer the rights of citizenship to those among 10,000 Russian officers who
have reached retirement age - but not to those among them in their thirties
and forties whom the Estonians believe are present or former secret
policemen who have been actively engaged in espionage and other anti-state
activities.
The agreement puts to one side two other Estonian demands - for a return of
two slices of Russian territory which had been part of the pre-war Estonian
Republic, and for a statement of regret on the Russian side for the Soviet
occupation of Estonia and the repression of the population after the war.
Neither of these - especially, as Estonian officials admit privately, the
first - are likely to be conceded and may be shelved quietly if relations
settle down.
Some 500,000 Russian speakers still live in Estonia; 40,000 have applied to
leave, 60,000 have applied for Estonian citizenship and the majority are
undecided. Estonia's economy is in by far the healthiest shape of any of the
15 former Soviet states and this is likely to persuade many of the Russian
speakers to learn enough Estonian to pass the language test necessary to
apply to transfer their allegiance from Russia to Estonia.

<TEXT>
Martin Marietta and Loral, two US defence companies, reported markedly
different results for the three months to June, a period in which both were
buoyed by contributions from recent acquisitions.
Martin Marietta failed to meet market expectations with a 31 per cent
advance in net income, to Dollars 162m. Earnings per share of Dollars 1.29,
fully diluted, were ahead of last year's 99 cents but well short of some
market expectations.
Meanwhile, Loral's earnings of 65 cents a share were ahead of last year's 48
cents and above what the market had been looking for.
Martin Marietta's figures in the second quarter were the first to include
contributions from the space systems division of General Dynamics it
acquired in May. Despite this, sales fell 5 per cent from a year before, to
Dollars 2.5bn.
The figures were helped by a Dollars 50m fee paid by Grumman after Northrop,
another defence company, stepped in to upset their planned merger earlier
this year. This was offset in part by a Dollars 37m pre-tax charge for cost
overruns on a jet engine programme.
Loral, meanwhile, reported net income of Dollars 55m on sales of Dollars
1.3bn, compared with Dollars 40m on sales of Dollars 850m a year ago.
Mr Bernard Schwarz, chairman and chief executive, said the company expected
earnings growth for the year as a whole to exceed 20 per cent. The latest
figures showed 'solid programme performance and strong margins,' he said.

Chevron, the San Francisco-based energy group, turned in worse than expected
results for the second quarter as profit margins at its refining and
marketing operations slipped further than those of other big US energy
companies.
Overall, after-tax profits in the period were Dollars 257m (after a Dollars
5m charge,) against Dollars 50m (after special charges of Dollars 515m) the
year before.
Earnings per share were 39 cents, up from 8 cents a year ago (or 87 cents
before charges). For the first six months, net income was Dollars 645m
(after charges of Dollars 41m), compared with Dollars 551m (after charges of
Dollars 517m).

Cyprus Amax Minerals, the US mining group, reported second-quarter earnings
of Dollars 32m, or 30 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 697m, up from
Dollars 23m, or 49 cents, on sales of Dollars 453m in the corresponding 1993
quarter, disregarding large one-time gains recorded in last year's second
quarter.
In the first half, on a comparable basis, Cyprus Amax earned Dollars 60m, or
55 cents, on sales of Dollars 1.3bn, up from Dollars 19m, or 39 cents, on
sales of Dollars 828m in the first half of 1993.
The income gains reflect operating improvements, particularly in the coal
sector, that followed the merger of Cyprus Minerals and Amax late last year.
Coal operations had record production of 20m tons in the quarter, with
earnings at Dollars 34m.
The company's copper operations earned Dollars 35m in the quarter on sales
of 173m pounds of copper, up from Dollars 10m in the same 1993 quarter,
benefiting from cost reductions and higher copper prices.
Asarco, another large US copper producer, reported second-quarter earnings
of Dollars 5.4m, or 13 cents a share, up from a loss of Dollars 24.1m, or 58
cents, in the same 1993 quarter. Sales in the quarter were Dollars 487.8m,
compared with Dollars 416.6m.

network
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines plans to create a worldwide high-speed voice
and data network to offer advanced communications services to multinational
business users.
The initiative reflects IBM's determination to claim leadership in
network-centric computing, commonly known as information superhighway
services.
Mr Lou Gerstner, chairman, has identified network-centric computing as one
of six strategic imperatives for IBM's recovery and growth.
The company has formed a business unit, IBM Global Network, with a staff of
5,000 people, to develop and operate the network. It will be headed by Mr
John Whiteside, formerly of MCI Communications, the US long-distance
telephone service company.
'The IBM Global Network will be the business persons Internet,' said Mr
Whiteside, referring to the global web of computer networks that link tens
of thousands of computers. Like Internet, IBM's Global Network will enable
companies to share multimedia data and services among their computers
worldwide.
'The computing environment of the future is one where networks do much more
than just provide for the transport of information,' said Mr James
Cannavino, IBM senior-vice president for strategy and development.
'Applications and services will be embedded in high-speed voice and data
networks, and people who use these services - whether to fill out an order
entry form or to watch a movie - do so by accessing the network, rather than
a software application sitting on their desktop,' he predicted. 'The IBM
Global Network will accelerate the evolution to this new computing model.'
To create its global network IBM will draw together existing national and
regional networks including Advantis, a US joint venture between IBM and
Sears Roebuck and IBM information networks throughout the world.
The network will cover more than 700 cities around the globe, providing
networking-based services to 23,000 companies in 94 countries.
IBM Global Network will work in partnership with IBM's outsourcing
businesses to offer a broad range of information processing services.

FT  27 JUL 94 / International Company News: Freeport impresses with a net
income of Dollars 4.63m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Higher metals and phosphate fertiliser prices helped Freeport-McMoRan, the
New Orleans-based natural resources group, report second-quarter net income
of Dollars 4.63m, or 3 cents a share, compared with a net loss of Dollars
77.4m, or 54 cents, a year ago.
For the six months to June 30, Freeport recorded net income of Dollars 17m,
or 12 cents, against a net loss of Dollars 132.7m, or 93 cents.
Second-quarter revenues benefited from increased sales volumes too:
Freeport's metals affiliate, Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold, sold 168.6m lbs
of copper and 185,400 troy ounces of gold, up from 140m lbs and 127,200
ounces in the same quarter of 1993.
A price protection hedging programme also lifted the average realised price
of copper to Dollars 1.02 a lb against 90 cents while gold sale prices
averaged Dollars 353.82 an ounce compared with Dollars 338.60.
However, copper production costs were abnormally high in the quarter - at
61.4 cents a lb against 59.4 cents in the first quarter - because of low ore
grades and recoveries. Freeport said costs would be significantly lower in
the second half of 1994.

Equifax, the Atlanta-based information services group, and UAPT-Infolink,
the United Kingdom credit referencing business, last night announced a
recommended all-cash offer for UAPT-Infolink.
The offer, at Pounds 5 per share, values UAPT-Infolink at approximately

It represents a premium of 49.3 per cent over the UAPT-Infolink share price
of Pounds 3.35 on July 25, 1994.
The board of UAPT-Infolink is unanimously recommending the offer.
Equifax has received undertakings to accept or indications of support in
relation to the offer in respect of 32.1 per cent of UAPT-Infolink's issued
ordinary share capital.
Mr Travis Halford, chief executive of Equifax Europe, commenting on the
offer, said last night: 'We are delighted to have agreed terms with
UAPT-Infolink's board. This attractive offer for UAPT-Infolink is made
possible by virtue of the efficiencies our combined UK businesses can
achieve.'

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Mexican government yesterday ordered an inquiry into a road accident
that left the left-wing opposition candidate for governor in the southern
state of Chiapas seriously injured, and three of his colleagues dead.
Mr Amando Avendano, of the Party of Democratic Revolution (PRD), was in a
serious condition after his car had collided with a lorry on Monday morning.
He was flown to Mexico City for treatment after suffering a punctured lung,
broken ribs and facial and neck injuries.
Mr Javier Lopez Moreno, the Chiapas governor, said all the information
indicated 'it was a true accident'.
However, Mr Avendano's wife said that she believed the crash had been
planned and was part of a campaign against the movement for peace in
Chiapas.
PRD leaders demanded a meticulous investigation of the crash.
Mr Avendano, an editor of a local newspaper in the town of San Cristobal de
las Casas, has been attacked by local ranchers and other landlords for his
good relations with the Zapatista rebels who began an insurrection in
Chiapas on January 1.
The PRD candidate was on his way to the state capital for a breakfast with
candidates from other parties. The lorry that hit his car was driven on the
wrong side of the road and had no number plate. Its driver fled soon
afterwards, apparently unharmed. Police were reported to be close to
capturing the driver.
The crash has raised fears of further instability in the state of Chiapas,
before the Mexican presidential election and the state election on August
21. Zapatista rebels control a small part of the state and are planning to
hold a 'convention for democracy' early next month.
The PRD has agreed to send observers.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Israel said yesterday it did not seek 'one square inch' of Lebanese
territory or 'one cubic metre' of Lebanese water and would sign a peace
treaty and withdraw Israeli forces from southern Lebanon as soon as the
Beirut government demonstrated it controlled its sovereign soil.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, said Israel would respect the
accepted international border in any peace deal but complained Syrian troops
and Iranian revolutionary guards were still in Lebanon and that an 'all out
war' existed between Israeli and Israeli-backed Arab forces and the
guerrillas of the Hizbollah or Party of God were being supplied by Iran
through Syria.
Mr Rabin accused Syria of failing to use its 'preventive capability' to rein
in Hizbollah attacks. Once the Lebanese goverment proved it was in full
control of its territory and could guarantee the security of its border
Israel would agree to peace.
'I believe they are capable if somebody from the outside will not
interfere,' he said.

Lawyers for Fiat have won an important battle to clear the group's senior
executives of involvement in a corruption scandal concerning payment of some
L100bn (Pounds 41m) in bribes to politicians to secure contracts for the
Rome metro. A Rome judge late on Monday dismissed the case against Mr Cesare
Romiti, Fiat's chief executive officer, and Mr Francesco Mattioli, the motor
group's chief financial officer. The case against Mr Carlo De Benedetti,
head of Olivetti, was dismissed earlier. However, the same judge sent for
trial a group of prominent ex-politicians and businessmen including: Mr
Bettino Craxi, former Socialist leader; Mr Vittorio Sbardella, the Rome
Christian Democrat close to former premier Giulio Andreotti; and Mr Franco
Nobili, former head of the Iri state holding company. So far L6bn of bribes
has been recovered from Swiss bank accounts. This money has been returned to
the municipality of Rome, which had launched a civil suit in the
proceedings.

Ukraine's prime minister and the chairman of parliament have said they
favour keeping the Chernobyl nuclear power station open unless the
international community provides more money to help close it and supply new
sources of electricity. Offers of Dollars 600m from the European Union and
Dollars 200m from the Group of Seven earlier this month were not enough,
they said, to shut Chernobyl down and replace it with a safer nuclear plant.
The EU has estimated the cost at Dollars 1.6bn. Ukrainian nuclear officials
have claimed that undue pressure is being put on Ukraine with respect to
safety, compared to other east European countries. 'If there is not enough
money,' said Mr Serhiy Parashin, director of the Chernobyl station, 'we
freeze the process of improving safety.'

FT  27 JUL 94 / Second London blast after Israel embassy hit: Rabin gives
warning of new wave of Islamic terrorism - Eighteen injured in explosions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An explosion damaged buildings near the headquarters of a large Jewish
charity in north London early this morning, just hours after a powerful car
bomb blasted Israel's embassy in west London.
Four people were slightly injured in the second blast at about 12.45am,
which ripped out shopfront windows in the High Road, North Finchley.
Witnesses reported a car burning immediately after the explosion.
After the first bomb injured 14 at the west London embassy, Israel's prime
minister Mr Yitzhak Rabin warned the world was facing a new wave of radical
Islamic terrorism, a day after Israel signed a historic co-operation
agreement with Jordan.
The two London explosions followed a car bomb attack on a Jewish centre in
Buenos Aires on July 18 which killed at least 96 people, and prompted Mr
Rabin to suggest that European and American countries were at risk from 'a
wave' of attacks by extremists.
'They continue a struggle of terror to kill Israelis, to fight against
moderate Arab regimes and to do everything to undermine any possibility . .
. to bring about a comprehensive peace between Israel and its neighbouring
Arab countries and the Palestinians,' he said.
President Clinton said at a news conference with Mr Rabin and King Hussein
of Jordan that the enemies of peace had not been silent. 'We will not - we
must not - allow them to disrupt this peace process,' he said.
The early morning explosion, in the heart of Jewish north London, was near
the offices of the Joint Israel Appeal, a prominent Jewish charity which
raises about Pounds 30m a year for humanitarian needs.
Mr Abdul Carim, a local resident, said: 'I was sitting reading when I heard
a tremendous explosion. I looked out and saw a car burning in the road. The
house next to me had all of its windows shattered and there is glass all
along the street.'
Police immediately taped off surrounding streets and began checking parked
cars in the North Finchley shopping distrct, although residents were not
evacuated.
Mr Chris Webb, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Police, said three of the
injured had been in a passing car. The fourth was a resident. All were
understood not to have been seriously injured.
The earlier attack extensively damaged the Israeli embassy in west London
and rocked nearby buildings in the capital's 'embassy row', including
Kensington Palace, where four members of the British royal family were
unharmed.
The blast at around 12.10pm occurred without warning, although one embassy
official said a vehicle driven by a woman had been diverted by security
staff from the main entrance minutes before the explosion outside the
embassy.
Commander David Tucker, head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad in
London, said last night police were seeking a woman of 55 to 60 years,
believed to have been driving the car, which was thought to contain about
20-30lb of commercial explosives.
Ms Rachel Gordan, a member of the embassy press office, said: 'It was a
huge, huge explosion. Parts of the building just collapsed.' Builder Mr
Michael Hassit, who was working nearby, said he saw a 'big plume of smoke
and debris going up to 200 feet up in the air'.
The London embassy, together with other Jewish buildings around the world,
has been on heightened security alert since the Buenos Aires attack.
However, the attackers clearly managed to exploit vulnerable security points
around the embassy building in an operation which some security experts
believe would have taken several weeks to plan.
Mr Douglas Hogg, Foreign Office minister, described the attack as a
'shocking offence' and said security in the UK would be stepped up. He
added, however, that there could not be full security guarantees in an 'open
city like London'.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of Tunisia (12): New avenues of finance - Banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bankers seeking emerging markets have reason to show some enthusiasm for
Tunisia. The banking sector, which has seen the growth of bond, equity and
forex markets and a loosening of the regulatory framework, indicates a
dynamic market in embryo. One note of caution, however: a small market with
limited investment opportunity will require a long period of gestation.
The expansion of Tunisia's financial sector in both quantitative and
qualitative terms is, nevertheless, under way. The most notable recent
addition to banks' activities has been the establishment of an interbank
foreign exchange market in March this year.
Until then, the central bank was estimated to be making between Dollars 50m
and Dollars 60m annually, according to one senior private banker. Although
the central bank remains the main trader by setting the reference rate and
requiring banks to deal only within 1 per cent of that rate, access to forex
trade should add approximately Dollars 30m to the Tunisian banks' income in
1994.
Convertibility will, in the long term, also blur the lines between onshore
and offshore banks, although the fiscal advantages of banking offshore will
remain. The possibility of carrying through foreign trade or investment
finance into the Tunisian dinar enables offshore banks to service their
foreign customers' daily operations in Tunisia and should encourage the
offshores to set up onshore subsidiaries or partnerships with Tunisian
banks. Access to foreign currency markets for the first time will allow
domestic banks to offer Tunisian customers continued financial services for
transactions abroad.
Relaxation of credit authorisation and interest rate interference has been
another boost to the banks. Private companies can now borrow up to Dollars
3m and banks up to Dollars 10m without prior authorisation from the central
bank. The ceiling on rates, which originally stood at 3 per cent above the
central bank rate and was then moved to a system of an average 3 per cent
differential, has also been eradicated.
The introduction of relatively stringent prudential regulation has
complemented this liberalisation with new assurances of the banks' security.
The World Bank points out that problem portfolios in a number of Tunisia's
domestic banks are likely to be exposed, but the adoption of prudential
rules is an encouraging indicator to foreign investors of Tunisia's
international outlook. It will also comfort one London banker who says that
at the moment the banks' 'asset quality is under a bit of pressure'.
The banks now abide by the Bank of International Settlement's Basle accord,
although they have set their capital ratio, computed as the capital funds
over a weighted sum of assets and off-balance sheet items, at a 5 per cent
minimum as opposed to the standard 8 per cent. Senior bankers claim this
provision is necessary to encourage greater liquidity in the credit market.
The scarcity of credit and investment opportunity is the greatest check on
bankers' enthusiasm.
Bankers look to the bourse, with a market capitalisation today of Dollars
1.6bn and growing, to open up new avenues for finance and investment.
Privatisation is their chief hope; government sell-offs will increase the
scope of equity investment, encourage private owners to float, and offer
private sector banks the chance to provide trade finance services for
Tunisian companies which now, as state enterprises, are financed through the
central bank.
One clear benefit of a slow and steady approach to developing the financial
sector has been a good grounding for Tunisia's banking community - when the
market emerges, Tunisia's eager dealers will be ready for it. Mr Angus Blair
of Barings Securities, the merchant bank, speaks of 'dynamic brokers in the
market gearing themselves up . . . we see people of high calibre, a very
positive sign.'

FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of Tunisia (11): Europeans are targeted - James
Harding looks at the country's tourism strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Tourism in Tunisia is a sun, sea and sand product,' according to Mr
Mohammed Jegham, minister for tourism. 'There is sometimes another 's', but
we do not encourage that, we leave it to our tourists.'
So saucy a comment may seem out of place from a minister of a state where
Islam is the dominant religion, but from the representative of a tourism
industry making a pitch for the Mediterranean market it is quite
appropriate. Rather than aiming for tourists to Morocco or Egypt, Mr Jegham
has his sights on people who might go to the Balearics, Canaries or Greece.
Along the coast and on the islands just offshore, purpose-built resorts at
Tabarka and Jerba, along with established destinations such as Hammamet,
Sousse and Monastir, offer holiday-makers guaranteed sun, a decent stretch
of sand, soft rock by the poolside, a cuisine blessed by both French and
Arab influences, and local wine, all for less than they would get it on the
northern side of the Med.
Tourists appear to be appreciating this. Mr Jegham predicts a record year
for hard-currency receipts from tourism of Dollars 1.3bn, rising by a
further 15 per cent to Dollars 1.5bn in 1995. The official figures support
his optimism, showing that for the first four months of 1994 tourists spent
4.54m nights in Tunisia, up 24 per cent on the previous year. Results are
particularly encouraging for the new luxury resorts offering golf, sailing,
hunting and diving in addition to the standard indulgences of a beach
holiday, with tourism nights up by 48 per cent at Tabarka and 38 per cent at
Jerba.
What is significant in a sector which represents only 5-6 per cent of GDP
but 20-25 per cent of hard currency receipts, is that Tunisia is attracting
more European tourists. In 1993, west European visitors rose by 17 per cent
to 2.16m, including 712,000 Germans, 448,000 Frenchmen, 246,000 Britons and
242,000 Italians.
The east European market is also being developed successfully, with numbers
doubling to 70,000 last year, estimated to increase to 100,000 this year,
and predicted to grow to 150,000 in 1995.
It is numbers that drive Tunisia's tourism strategy. The pace of
construction suggests that the country will have 200,000 hotel beds by the
end of the century.
Investment in quantity, which offers regular, bankable receipts, rather than
quality, which is notoriously vulnerable to trends in elite tourism, may
seem over-cautious. But Tunisian hoteliers point out that even if five-star
tourists spend a lot, they can also be infuriatingly unpredictable.
Considering the numbers of workers who rely on tourism - Tunisian hotels
employ 60,000 people and other linked sectors a further 200,000 according to
the tourism ministry, not to mention its impact on such sectors as
construction, agriculture and services - prudent investment in the more
dependable beach holiday market promises steady results.
Nevertheless, sun, sea and sand is not all that is on offer - for travellers
who interpret Mr Jegham's fourth 's' to mean sites, there are several points
of interest. In addition to the Islamic sites at Kairouan, the mosaics at
the Bardo museum, and the desert in the south, there are several outstanding
Roman sites.
At El Jem stands the largest amphitheatre in Africa visible from five miles
away across the open scrub of the Sahel plain. The 30,000-seater was built
in the second century AD and despite recurrent attacks and bombardment
against rebels who holed up in there over the first 1,000 years of its
existence, it is well-preserved. The delicate touches in the form of
mosaics, inscriptions and sculpture which are noticeably missing from the
theatre itself can be found in the accompanying museum.
In the north-west corner of Tunisia, not far from the Algerian border, two
further Roman sites are available for what is, in effect, a private viewing.
Dougga, a large provincial Roman town built in AD 168 sprawls across a
hillside commanding a view across a broad valley of olive groves,
wheatfields and fallow ground. For an 1,800-year-old site, it feels
strangely lived-in - the interconnecting dwellings, shops, latrines and
temples recreate a sense of the intimacy of the original Dougga community.
The wealthy inhabitants of Bulla Regia, which lies above the Mejerda Valley
and 60km north of Dougga, chose to build underground rather than on a
hillside exposed to the heat. They made little allowance in architectural or
aesthetic terms for the inconvenience of building beneath the ground - the
villas exhibit classical courtyards, the remains of central fountains and a
few pristine mosaics in situ, all in a cool, comfortable environment.
These exceptional sites are largely untroubled by tourists. Development of
the beach holiday package has been at the expense of investment in the
infrastructure for sightseeing. As a result, the benefits of privacy in
'discovering' Tunisia are paid for in the costs of transport  - car hire is
extortionate.
With receipts growing at 10 per cent on the back of Mediterranean business,
there is little reason for the enthusiastic and successful Mr Jegham to
redirect Tunisia's tourism strategy to invest in roads and buses to the
sites and super-luxury hotels for an elite clientele. Until that kind of
investment is made, however, you will have to wake the gatekeeper at Dougga.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of Tunisia (9): Chance for local talent -
Construction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Modern Tunisia is not a land of grand architectural statements. North
Africa's smallest country lacks a grandiose mosque, such as the one just
completed in Casablanca, or a massive monument, like that to the martyrs of
the revolution which dominates Algiers. Indeed, the capital has no striking
modern buildings, a state of affairs certain Tunisians regret as they know
their country boasts some fine architects such as the Ben Miled brothers.
Yet any visitor to Tunis and the major cities cannot help but be struck by
the number of construction sites and the quality of buildings as diverse as
hotels, hospitals, schools and private housing. Nor are these modern
buildings confined to big cities and the heavily populated coastline. Small
provincial towns are developing fast; for example Gafsa, whose buildings are
very much in keeping with its traditional and distinct style of
architecture.
Three in four Tunisian households live in homes they already own or are in
the process of buying. The choice of housing to suit every purse is
considerable and over the years the state has pursued an active policy of
helping poorer families get a roof over their heads, with running water and
decent sanitation.
Achieving this aim would not have been possible had not the construction and
civil engineering sectors been so efficient. One of the reasons for this is
the relatively low cost of building which, in turn, results from the fact
that most of the work is carried out by Tunisian firms whose workers and
engineers are indigenous.
An estimated 1,500 com- panies employ about 250,000 people, thus putting the
construction and civil engine- ering sector ahead of all others, except
farming, in the number of people it employs. Many companies are very small
but others, such as the Eltaief group, employ up to 4,000 people. The
diversity and competition which characterise this sector have in recent
years allowed Tunisian civil engineering companies to win contracts in many
African countries, often in partnership with French and British
counterparts.
This success story can be traced to the days before independence. First of
all, more Tunisians gained access to the French 'grandes ecoles' such as
Polytechnique Centrale and Ponts et Chaussees than any other foreign group,
a state of affairs which continues to this very day.
Secondly, and in sharp contrast to neighbouring Algeria, a number of small
Tunisian-owned and run building companies were operating as early as after
the second world war. Some building companies, such as the Eltaief and
M'Henni companies, which were started by small builders in the Sahel region
of the country, today rank among the biggest in Tunisia.
The new state encouraged very early on competition among these emerging
companies. Public tenders became the norm and even those enterprises which
were state- owned or joint ventures between the state and private
entrepreneurs were run as private companies.
The liberation of the economy after the socialist experiment of the 1960s
gave a big boost to building as did the policies aimed at developing the
tourist sector, public health and education. Hospitals are to be found in
every region of Tunisia and the rate of literacy is one of the highest in
the Arab and African world.
Gambling on growing local talent has paid off handsomely. Today Tunisian
entrepreneurs and civil engineers account for 90 per cent of all building
and public works undertaken in the country.
Housing is entirely carried out by Tunisian companies, as are new roads and
the new motorway from Tunis to Hammamet which has recently been extended to
M'Saken and will soon reach the country's industrial powerhouse, the city of
Sfax. The same goes for ports, once a preserve of French companies such as
Dumez and Grands Travaux de l'Est. Foreign companies do get involved
sometimes as Dragados y Constructiones did with the new port in Zarzis
because the project was entirely financed by a Spanish state-subsidised
credit.
Another area where Tunisian companies are making great strides is in the
building of dams and airports. All small dams are built by local companies
but bigger projects such as the dam on Ouled R'Mel are being constructed by
Bredero, a joint venture between the Dutch Bredero and a Tunisian bank,
Societe Tunisienne de Banque. Many of these major public works projects have
been partly financed by loans from the World Bank, other regional
development banks or Arab funds. The proceeds of these loans have thus
benefited indigenous companies far more than has been the case in
neighbouring countries where the tight control maintained by the state over
the economy has not allowed the development of an indigenous class of
sophisticated civil engineers and construction companies.
Another notable development in recent years has been the growing number of
building contractors such as Studi and SET which have gained valuable work
in Africa. This has reinforced the emerging service sector, one where
Tunisia's position on the map, growing quality of communications with the
outside world and more educated population are proving to be key factors.
Tunisia will soon get its own Polytechnique school modelled on its Paris
counterpart, thanks to a FFr200m gift from France. There will no shortage of
skilled teachers but ironically a French company will be associated in the
building of the school, even though Tunisian companies could do it all
themselves. But French participation is a condition laid down by Paris.
It is an exception which confirms the rule that, by and large today, most of
the building requirements for the country's growing economy can be met by
local talent and companies.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of Tunisia (10): Fields no longer marginal - Oil and
gas exploration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hydrocarbon exploration in Tunisia will reach a new high in 1994, with 38
exploration agreements in force and 20 exploration wells expected to be
drilled. Uncharitable observers say the surge in exploration is a desperate
bid to resurrect the industry after a 10.5 per cent fall in 1993 followed a
decade of gradual decline in oil production.
Increased domestic energy consumption, combined with falling output from
Tunisia's largest oilfields, pushed exports down by 22 per cent to Dollars
23m below oil imports in 1993, forcing Tunisia into a deficit on its oil
account for the first time in 20 years. A predicted rise in oil consumption
from 3.516m metric tonnes in 1993 to 3.684m tonnes this year indicates that
Tunisia will maintain a deficit in 1994. The decline in production is
expected to slow, with an official estimate showing a 2.2 per cent drop to
4.545m tonnes in 1994.
Gloom, however, is largely unwarranted. A shrewd government policy of
enabling the production of marginal or previously unmarketable reserves and
fiscal encouragement to explore for further fields will compensate for the
decline of Tunisia's original large oil producers. High levels of
exploration activity demonstrate international confidence that there are
discoveries waiting to be made in Tunisia. And, starting from 1995, a
hydrocarbons surplus seems assured with the coming on stream of gas from
Miskar in the Gulf of Gabes.
The Miskar field was discovered over 20 years ago but despite proven
reserves of 33bn cu metres has remained untapped. It was only with the
development of a guaranteed domestic market for gas, under- pinned by the
transfer to gas-based electricity production and confirmed by a purchase
agreement with the Tunisian government covering the lifetime of the field,
that it became viable for development.
British Gas is now investing Dollars 650m to set up four production
platforms offshore, a 120km pipeline and the Hannibal processing plant,
outside Sfax, which will remove nitrogen, carbon dioxide and hydrogen
sulphide and then pass the clean gas to power stations at Tunis, Sousse and
Gabes.
It is thought British Gas could start production as early as April 1995,
with four wells open by the end of May, compared with a contractual date of
September 1995. Peak production of 160m-180m cu ft a day (or 1.5m tonnes of
oil equivalent a year) should be reached in a year and maintained for five
to six years, while compression apparatus may be used at the offshore
platforms from 1998 to keep output at capacity. The field's estimated life
is 18 to 20 years.
Tunisia has a lot to gain from Miskar. Gas production, primarily for the
domestic energy market, will release a greater volume of oil for export. It
will allow Tunisia to transfer more Algerian gas which it has used for
domestic electricity generation, increasing its tariff income on the gas
pumped through the Transmed pipeline from Algeria to Italy. A scheduled
doubling in gas volume through Transmed in 1995 will further increase tariff
revenues.
The fixed tariff on the Algerian gas and the agreed price for gas from
Miskar enable Tunisia to profit from spot trades in the fluctuating
international gas market. And, of course, it is hoped that the British Gas
project will increase employment in Sfax and develop the domestic skills
base in gas production.
British Gas, too, is expected to profit from a deal with a lifetime purchase
guarantee, albeit at a price linked to oil.
However, considering the size of investment for a comparatively small
production volume, margins appear precariously narrow. However, the building
of a processing plant designed to outlive the Miskar field by as much as 15
years indicates confidence at British Gas that its future in Tunisia will
run to more than Miskar.
That confidence is shared by a number of British Gas competitors. Despite a
squeeze on funds in the last few years following the drop in oil prices,
investment in exploration in Tunisia has almost doubled from Dollars 61m in
1988 to a predicted Dollars 120m in 1994.
The reason for the high level of exploratory interest, according to Mr
Kesraoui, chief executive of Etap, the state manager of the oil and gas
sector, is the favourable environment for developing marginal fields.
As well as the advantages of moderate labour costs and low transport
requirements in a small country like Tunisia, Mr Kesraoui points to the
fiscal and legislative regime which enables companies to produce profitably
from small finds. The profits-related tax regime, the lowering of royalty
and corporation tax rates and the establishment of capital uplifts on
certain exploration expenditures have significantly improved the tax burden
for international explorers.
Not that the oil and gas industries in Tunisia are without any complaints.
Government pressure to provide jobs and the demands of the employment codes
require foreign companies to show tact and diplomacy in navigating the
labour market. Industry observers calculate that Tunisian expectations for
labour requirements on the British Gas Hannibal processing plant, for
example, may be as much as five times the actual need.
The tax regime, as well, is subject to criticism. Companies are taxed by
field for their activities in Tunisia, as opposed to on a global basis.
Thus, exploration and seismic analysis costs cannot be offset against
production profits on fields discovered before 1990.
Despite these gripes, the industry shows a healthier complexion than a
decade ago. For the 12-year period following the discovery at Ashtart in
1974, there were no significant finds of new oil reserves. However, a
discovery at the Ezzaouia field near Zarzis in 1986 was followed by Maamoura
in 1988, and Sidi el Kilani in 1989, encouraging an adventurous mood among
explorers.
Dr Cameron Davies, of Oil Management Services, a hydrocarbon consultant,
points out that finds in Tunisia's limestone reservoir 'helped to redirect
the thinking of exploration geologists towards unusual reservoirs in chalks,
karstified carbonates and hightly fractured limestones.'
That new thinking and the fiscal regime have led to the opening and
development of a number of small fields. The Belli field discovered in 1991
produces 16,000 barrels of oil a day, Sidi el Kilani averages 10,000 b/d and
the Cercena field discovered in 1992 started production in June with 4,000
b/d. These sites are small in comparison with the volume of gas coming on
line from Miskar. But encouraging marginal fields in the oil sector is the
pragmatic way of regenerating the industry as the old mammoths wither.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of Tunisia (8): Palms and prosperity - The date
export market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since time immemorial, the date palm has been the source of wealth and the
symbol of prosperity in certain Mediterranean and Middle Eastern countries.
As is true with the olive oil it produces, Tunisia belongs to a small group
of countries which accounts for virtually all the dates produced in the
world.
Though it ranks second to Iraq as a producer and recently as an exporter,
Tunisia can claim that its deglet nour date (the fingers of light) is the
finest palm date in the world. The value of exports has more than doubled to
USDollars 55m over the past 10 years. North Africa's smallest country
possesses an undeniable comparative advantage where dates are concerned but
the challenge presented by higher quality control, better packaging and
modern marketing techniques is one which confronts many sectors in the food
processing industries. Unlike other produce, however, European Union quotas
do not pose a problem.
Production of dates in Tunisia has always rested in private hands - 20,000
hectares, spread among thousands of small holders in the oasis around the
towns of Tozeur and Kebili which lie on the northern and southern slopes of
the Shott El Jerid salt flatlands of southern Tunisia. Three million date
palm trees also produce wood and palm leaves widely used for building,
fencing and fuel. As old palms stop producing dates, new ones have been
planted and annual production figures today stand at 100,000 tonnes of dates
every year.
Date palms have to be individually pollinated and the fruit hand-picked,
skills which risk becoming sparse as young Tunisians from the oasis are
increasingly tempted by easier jobs offered in local hotels or in towns
along the coast. Many oases are half abandoned today, yet their well-being
is essential not only to keep the population on the land but to attract
foreign tourists, who are discovering the pleasures of travelling in the
desert in winter time in ever greater numbers.
In the mid-1980s, the rising price of dates on world markets resulted in
fast-growing incomes in the oasis. But higher incomes were not matched by
greater efforts to ensure quality (which in particular means avoiding
worms), by improving irrigation and fertilising methods. As world prices
fell in the late 1980s because of greater competition, Tunisian producers
learnt the hard way that there is no such thing as a free ride. According to
exporters in Tunis, they now have a greater appreciation of the absolute
need to improve quality.
Until Mr Habib Bourguiba, the former president, halted his experiment in
collectivised farming in 1969, the Societe Tunisienne des Industries
Laitieres held a monopoly in respect of the conditioning and exporting of
dates. The conditioning monopoly was abolished in 1971 and the export
monopoly ended soon afterwards. Many of those involved in conditioning are
actively promoting sales in the European Union where virtually all Tunisian
dates are sold.
Packaging has been much improved in recent years to meet European countries'
requirements and break the stranglehold of a few middlemen in Marseilles who
were, as one Tunisian exporter put it, 'a necessary evil.'
Transport costs, however, remain high. Some dates are shipped in lorries.
There is a container service between Tunis and Antwerp, even between Tunis
and Los Angeles, but not between Tunis and Marseilles. Dates delivered to
Los Angeles are thus only one-third more expensive than those delivered to
France. Bringing down transport costs is no easy matter but Tunisian
exporters are trying to meet the challenge.
Worldwide production of dates amounts to about 1.5m tonnes annually,
one-third of which is traded internationally. Tunisia is the second largest
exporter, with 20,000 tonnes a year. Until the beginning of this decade, the
most important exporter was Iraq, whose 200,000 tonnes of exports of
lesser-quality dates were traditionally shipped in bulk, mostly to Asian
markets, especially India. In recent years both production and exports of
Iraqi dates have plummeted, their place being taken by dates from Iran and
Pakistan which between them export roughly 150,000 tonnes every year to
Asian markets.
Tunisia has increased its exports since 1984 by nearly 50 per cent. Unlike
Iraq, its dates are sold in small, attractive package boxes and they all go
to European markets - 8,000 tonnes to France, 4,000 to Italy, 2,000 to Spain
and Belgium respectively, 1,500 to the UK and 1,000 to Germany. The dates
are increasingly sent directly to different European markets and distributed
through big importers of dried fruit and foodstuffs, such as Geest of the UK
and Torres of Spain.
Tunisia faces competition from two sources today: Algeria and, increasingly,
Israel. Algeria exports 8,000 tonnes of dates a year and has over the past
two or three years undercut Tunisian prices as its producers are desperate
to earn foreign exchange. Such competition is viewed by some Tunisians as
disloyal. Others point out that by forcing them to cut transport costs and
improve packaging and presentation, their neighbours are in the long run
doing them a service.
Israel exports 2,000 tonnes of deglet nour every year and has the advantage
over Tunisia that its dates ripen three weeks earlier and are sold in Europe
at the beginning of October in the run-up to the Christmas period. The onus
is therefore on the Tunisian producers to find ways in which they can
improve their methods of stocking and production or get dates to mature
earlier. However, Israeli dates have a disadvantage in that their skins are
thicker than those of Tunisian dates. But to convince European buyers of the
quality difference, Tunisian marketing and promotion efforts will have to be
stepped up.
The other important exporter is California, which sells 5,000 tonnes of
dates abroad a year. Californian dates are of poorer quality than those from
Tunisia but, needless to say, marketing techniques are far more
sophisticated.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of Tunisia (7): Hard life on the land - Francis
Ghiles looks at a quiet revolution in farming
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The past 12 months have been difficult for Tunisian farmers. After four good
years of rainfall, which produced an average cereal crop of 1.6m tonnes
annually, output of wheat and barley in 1994 is expected to fall to half
that figure. This, in turn, will shave 1 to 1.5 per cent off the rate of
growth of gross domestic product and will more than double the cost of
imports to around Dollars 250m to Dollars 300m.
In the past, a year of drought often led to disaster, but this is no longer
the case today. The country's economy is far more diversified and 1994 shows
signs of being an excellent year for tourism. In farming, the growing spread
of irrigation and wider use of fertilisers are leading to more diversified
and better quality crops.
Despite the progress of recent years, the sector still contributes on
average 15 per cent of GDP while employing 45 per cent of the labour force.
To enact reforms in a country characterised by semi-arid climate and a very
fragmented pattern of ownership, where 80 per cent of farms comprise 20
hectares or less, is no easy task.
But, as a younger generation of well-trained technicians take up new posts
and as more of the 500,000 hectares of state-owned land is leased for 25
years to private companies - which include smallholders and foreign
companies such as Shell - a quiet revolution is afoot, whose chances of
success depend on a sustained effort over the next decade.
These changes are also encouraged by a policy aimed at developing and
conserving water resources and ensuring that even remote areas get access to
drinking water and electricity. The latter fits in with the policy of doing
more for the poorer south and western hinterlands. That has been a
characteristic of regional development since the late 1980s.
If anything, the troubles in neighbouring Algeria will reinforce the
determination of Tunisia's leaders to ensure that those who live in the
poorer parts of the country do not feel left out of the slowly rising
prosperity which characterises its coastal and richer farming provinces.
The quiet revolution in the countryside can be attributed to four broad
factors:
The state has divested itself of a good half of the land it has held since
French farms were 'nationalised' 30 years ago. The land contains some of
Tunisia's most fertile soil and is let on leases of up to 25 years, either
to Tunisians who are often agricultural engineers, or to large Tunisian and
foreign firms. The best example of the latter is the domain of M'Raissa,
which is being developed by Shell together with Tunisian banking and
insurance groups.
The result is a switch from a 'socialist' form of farming, which normally
simply ensured that a given piece of land could feed those who worked it but
little more, to a form of farming which seeks to increase production, pays
serious attention to quality and requires a more educated workforce. The
ultimate goal of such developments is the production and export of
high-quality produce, anything from blood oranges to wine, from flowers to
seedless grapes.
The second factor is the freeing of input prices and the raising of producer
prices. Since 1986, when reforms aimed at liberalising the running of the
country's economy were introduced, the price of inputs, notably fertilisers,
has increased by nearly three-quarters and that of water by roughly 10 per
cent a year. The need to utilise resources more rationally is now widely
understood.
Complaints abound, however, about the bureaucratic ways of many of the 4,000
civil servants who sit in the sprawling Ministry of Agriculture in Tunis.
Many Tunisians interested in farming consider that a re-organisation of the
ministry is long overdue.
A third factor is related to the efforts under way to distribute Tunisian
products more widely in the European Union. Valiant efforts are being made
by the private sector to package olive oil, dates and other fruit more
attractively and to ensure steady high quality, both vital necessities when
faced with international competition. Ways are being sought to lower
transport costs, which are often high, to think of how best to create a
'Tunisia' label for certain products, to diversify from traditional markets,
such as France. All these moves are forcing painful changes further up the
prod- uction line.
The production of wine provides a good example of change. In 1963, Tunisia
produced 1.4m hectolitres of wine, 90 per cent of which was exported to
reinforce French wines. By 1978 production had fallen to 300,000 hectolitres
and the vines had grown old. More than one-third of the vines had been
pulled up and no wine was exported. There was no incentive to improve
quality as local drinkers or foreigners on package tours had no palate for
fine wines.
By the early 1980s, replanting started; a few years later new varieties were
introduced, such as Cabernet Franc and Merlot. Production started to
increase and now stands at around 450,000 hectolitres a year. New markets in
Europe, most notably in Germany which accounts for 60 per cent of the value
of wine exports, were being developed.
The Office du Vin is also making efforts to modernise the methods of making
wine and a new generation of bottles and labels is soon to hit the market.
The value of exports remains a modest Dollars 9m annually but the industry
accounts for 1.5m days of work every year.
A fourth factor is of a more social nature: to try to make life on the land
less harsh. This is vital to avoid a greater drift of population into
already large cities, virtually all of which are situated on the coast.
Also, there is the wider issue of preserving the environment, which the
Tunisian authorities have taken to heart in recent years. The social
stability of Tunisia commands that the income of the poorer north-west and
central southern regions be improved and that those living in poorer areas
do not feel left out of the coastal prosperity.
Many jobs, notably in the bloated civil service and tourist industry pay
relatively high incomes for work which is infinitely easier than tilling the
land. The minimal daily farm wage is only TD6, though many skilled
farmworkers earn far more, especially in the richer areas. Only 18 per cent
of those who work on the land - and this includes an ever-growing number of
women - are covered by the social security net, in sharp contrast to those
who work in industry and the civil service.
The challenge that the auth- orities face is one of improving the lot of
those who live on the land and tying higher wages, wherever possible, to
increases in productivity. To attract younger people (the average age of
those who till the land is 55), they must offer induce- ments even before
the results would justify them on strictly economic grounds.
The fight to improve production, to enhance the quality of what is grown and
gain export markets will, however, remain hampered by the ever-growing
fragment- ation of property and the considerable confusion that surrounds
title deeds. Such problems, however, are not susceptible of easy solution.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of The Bank of England (9): Systematic adjustment -
Global transformation has increased competition for gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Given the turmoil in international bond markets this year, most discussion
of the role of the Bank of England in the gilt-edged market has centred on
its ability to fund the government's deficit smoothly.
Look at the longer-term context, though, and a different picture emerges.
The Bank's role is about managing change in such a way that the gilts market
can hold its own in an era of global transformation.
Change came abruptly to the gilts market with the Big Bang revolution of
1986. That put an end to the old jobbing system, and introduced the concept
of marketmakers which was familiar to international investors even if it was
new to the UK domestic market.
But adapting to the new system has not always been easy; and with the
increasing internationalisation of financial flows, one could argue that the
process of change has become continuous. If the gilts market is to attract
funds, it simply has to be competitive with other leading bond markets.
The early stages of market reform after Big Bang brought disappointing
returns for the new marketmakers. A period of surplus in the government's
accounts meant that the market began to shrink. The number of marketmakers
seeking to make their fortune there dwindled noticeably  - though it has now
begun to pick up again. With the return of Hoare Govett (announced in June)
there will be 21 marketmakers, and capital committed to the market now
exceeds that at the time of Big Bang.
Thus the Bank can now claim that the system has been reasonably successful,
although returns for marketmakers remain quite modest. Last year the
combined after-tax profits of the marketmakers was just Pounds 59m, and
their net return on average capital was 9 per cent. Both these figures were
down on 1992 - the year which brought the bonanza of the Tory election
victory and the UK's exit from the exchange rate mechanism.
Still, there is no doubt that the marketmaking structure has brought the
market a high level of liquidity, narrower dealing spreads and a large
increase in overseas participation. More than half the marketmakers are of
foreign parentage. The structure is more robust: before Big Bang there were
only two jobbers (wholesale dealers).
The market is also now pretty large. The value of all stock outstanding rose
in 1993-94 to Pounds 218.5bn from Pounds 168.1bn the previous year. Daily
average turnover in 1993-94 rose to Pounds 6.7bn from Pounds 5.2bn. This
represented a little under 4 per cent of the total stock outstanding.
Index-linked stock accounts for about 15 per cent of the total. This year
the Bank has also added to the range of instruments by issuing two floating
rate stocks, as well as reviving the convertible instrument.
Since Big Bang the Bank has also had to adapt its operating techniques to
provide the government with the funds it needs. Nowadays, this involves a
mixture of regular auctions and tap issues designed to take advantage of
particular pockets of market demand. The auctions take place at roughly
monthly intervals and involve the sale of between Pounds 2bn and Pounds 4bn
worth of paper.
The Bank has been criticised this year for missing an opportunity to sell
very long-dated paper with a maturity of about 25 years at the time when
rates were at their lowest. Officials reply that it did manage to sell a
17-year issue at a yield of just 6.4 per cent in January, which still
represents a good deal for the taxpayer. More important, perhaps, is that
the mixture of auctions and tap issues allows it both to lock in good deals
in an opportunistic way, while giving the market some ability to predict
supply.
Such a pragmatic approach is typical of the Bank's general attitude.
Officials say it has tried to allow the market to evolve in the way that
people wanted. The marketmakers have thus been allowed to deal in swaps,
derivatives and Ecu instruments. This has enabled them to become integrated
with their parent groups in providing hedging services to their clients.
The evolutionary process continues, though some argue that it should go
faster. The big question confronting the Bank now is whether it should allow
general freedom to market participants to undertake repurchase arrangements
which effectively allow them to borrow and lend stock. Many believe that
this would help the gilts market compete at an international level, not
least by adding to liquidity.
The Bank is currently undertaking consultations with the market on the
question of repurchase deals, but its approach remains cautious. Among the
questions it is asking is whether a re-purchase system would work and
whether it would add to international demand for gilts. Arrangements are
already in place for market-makers to borrow stock. That is a privilege they
enjoy in return for the obligation to quote two way prices.
The Bank is also concerned about the impact of a repurchase system on other
parts of the financial markets. It might lessen the attraction of
certificates of deposit, bills and other financial instruments.
Another reform which the market has been seeking - the right to settle
transactions through the Euroclear and Cedel international settlement
facilities - seems less controversial. Certain technical issues have still
to be ironed out, but there is no obstacle in principle to the change.
In contrast to gilts, there has been less focus recently on the Bank's role
in managing the money markets. Though some might regard its system of
operating through specialised discount houses as antiquated, it seems to
work satisfactorily and the Bank is satisfied that it can exercise influence
over money market rates.
There was a problem, until recently, which was connected with the gilt
market where the Bank was selling more paper than strictly necessary in
order to comply with the rule that sales to banks and building societies did
not count as funding of the government deficit for monetary policy terms.
That meant the Bank was constantly having to relieve shortages of liquidity
in the money market.
The hope is that this problem will disappear now the funding rules have been
changed. The daily money market shortages have become less pronounced and
very short term rates are more stable.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of The Bank of England (8): Trials and tribulations
of the Old Lady - Richard Lambert traces the varied fortunes of an
institution founded in 1694 to fund a war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAMBERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
1694. Bank established by opportunistic merchants to fund the war against
France. The books are opened on June 21 at the Mercers' Hall, Cheapside, for
receiving subscriptions and within 11 days Pounds 1.2m is subscribed by
1,268 people. On July 27, the Bank is incorporated by Royal Charter as 'The
Governor and Company of the Bank of England'.
1696. Critical year for the Bank. Government, having failed in its attempts
to start a rival Land Bank, puts heavy demands on the Bank, which in turn
has to make calls on its stockholders.
1706. Closer relations with the government established as the Bank agrees to
act as its direct agent in circulating Exchequer Bills.
1707. Threatened invasion of the Pretender causes a run on the Bank, met by
further calls on the proprietors and - this time - a little friendly help
from government.
1708. An act of parliament gives it a monopoly over the most profitable part
of its business: issuing notes.
1717. Management of government securities transferred from the Exchequer to
the Bank.
1720. Bank escapes disaster when its offer to take over the whole of the
government debt is rejected in favour of the South Sea Company. When the
South Sea bubble is popped, the Bank also hits trouble, and at one stage in
the panic resorts to paying demands for cash in shillings and sixpences.
1745. Panic ensues as the army of the Young Pretender marches south. The
Bank again plays for time by paying notes in small change. Disaster is
averted as a powerful group of merchants meets at Garraway's and asserts its
confidence in the safety of the Bank.
1763. Bank for the first time acts as lender of last resort.
1780. Mob attacks Bank during the Gordon riots. Government provides a guard
of 534 soldiers, including 50 from the Brigade of Guards stationed inside
the Bank. This guard attends the Bank every night until 1973, although by
the end its forces have been depleted to one officer, three NCOs and eight
guardsmen. The officer, unlike his men, receives no payment for this
service, but may have one guest to dinner.
1781. Lord North refers to the Bank as 'from long habit and usage of many
years . . . a part of the constitution'.
1793-97. Further runs on the Bank, caused by political uncertainty from the
French revolution, and the failure of many country banks in England. With
its cash almost gone, the Bank announces that 'the general concerns of the
Bank were in the most affluent and prosperous situation'. Next day,
merchants and bankers assert their confidence in the institution.
1825. A financial bubble, caused in part by the Bank's erratic management of
credit. When it bursts, the Bank is seriously threatened: Rothschild
intervenes at a crucial moment by transferring large sums of gold coin into
the Bank from the continent.
1826. In response to this crisis, the Country Bankers Act is passed,
allowing the establishment of joint stock banks with power to issue their
own notes, not less than 65 miles from London. The idea is to make the
banking system more orderly.
1844. Bank Charter Act passed. This separates the Bank's note issue from its
banking operations, controls its issue of notes, and places severe limits on
its ability to develop commercial business. The Bank, showing what is to
become a well established lack of political sophistication, fails to realise
until the last moment that it is being imposed upon. Prime minister Sir
Robert Peel fails to respond to the bankers' moving appeals for more leeway.
1845. Bank employees allowed for the first time to take regular leave other
than on holy days.
1847. Awkward moment: following the collapse of grain prices, the Governor
goes bust.
1848. Chartist procession: Bank takes in extra garrison, and surrounds
itself with sand bags.
1857. Widespread financial crisis crosses the Atlantic from the US. Bank
rate at 10 per cent. Bank issues notes in excess of its statutory limit.
1866. Spectacular crash as the Bank allows Overend Gurney, one of the most
important City houses, to fail. In the subsequent trial, prosecuting counsel
observes: 'Whether stimulated by zeal or enthusiasm, or whether actuated by
that insane cupidity which was too largely a characteristic of the present
day, instead of adhering to the plain, honest and rational system which had
been adopted by the old members of the firm, they plunged into the most
extravagant speculation.'
1888. Bank plays crucial role in the conversion of Pounds 500m of British
government 3 per cent stock into 2 1/2 per cent.
1890. The Barings crisis. FT observes helpfully: 'Day by day, thick clouds
gather over the Stock Markets, and where they come from, and who is
responsible for them, no one has a definite opinion.' Governor faces down
the prime minister, and secures government help in bearing the losses.
1906. Quiet times. According to the official history: 'While the Court or
the Governor operated without explanation or self-justification - it was so
long since a Governor had said anything of public interest in General Court
that financial journals were ceasing to insert reports of its meetings -
leading bankers made occasional pronouncements on policy.'
1914. Government guarantees Bank against any loss on discounting bills of
exchange accepted prior to the declaration of war.
1940. Bank survives a direct hit by a high explosive bomb.
1946. Bank survives nationalisation by Labour government.
1971. Bank pushes Competition and Credit Control policy, which scraps
lending ceilings and gives market forces freer reign. The boom times are
coming.
1973. Rescue of Cedar Holdings marks the start of the secondary banking
crisis: Bank launches combined support operation known as the lifeboat.
1979. Bank loses one important function with the abolition of exchange
controls. Gains another through the Banking Act which gives it statutory
licensing and supervisory powers over UK deposit-taking institutions.
1984. Collapse of Johnson Matthey Bankers brings the Bank much embarrassment
 -and further statutory powers.
1991. Another ticklish moment, as BCCI goes down.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of Tunisia (6): No room for religious parties -
President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali provides answers on the key issues facing
the country in an interview with Roger Matthews
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the threat posed to Tunisia if Islamic fundamentalists come to power in
Algeria.
Of course, it could pose some difficulties for us. But it would not be a
real threat. In some ways, it is like a sickness. If you are healthy and
strong, then you will not be infected. We have a healthy body, so we have no
reason to fear anything.
On the causes of fundamentalism.
First, it is important to make clear that to some extent fundamentalism was
of our own making, and was at one time encouraged in order to combat the
threat of communism. Such groups were fostered in the universities and
elsewhere at that time in order to offset the communists and to strike a
balance. This is not really going back to the roots of the issue, but is one
aspect of it.
This phenomenon has also spread in some regions, not primarily because of
religious reasons, but because of social and economic causes, especially
where there have been pockets of poverty. Basically it is a socio-economic
problem.
How Tunisia has approached the problem.
Our approach has been multi-dimensional and we have avoided making only a
security response, although of course we have applied the law. We have
adopted policies which tackle the economic and social problems, by taking
care of the poorer regions and helping the poorest section of society. We
have tried to go to the roots of the problem.
My background in the military and security has provided me with a rich
experience in understanding the problem. For example, when in the past there
were demonstrations on the streets it was noticeable that the protesters
attacked the outward symbols of wealth. They threw stones at Mercedes
limousines and at luxury villas and houses. They showed their resentment at
the rich.
This was evidence that the real origin of the protests was social. It would
take hours to explain the full reasons for the phenomenon. I have been aware
of it since the 1970s and I was the first to write a paper on the subject of
fundamentalists and the danger they posed to the government here.
The role of democracy
In Algeria, the government sought to introduce a ready-made model of
democracy. But what is really important is what the people understand by
democracy. For example, in November 1987, two days after I had become
president, the minister of the interior told me that people who said they
were homeless had tried to invade some newly-constructed buildings.
They said that they had the right to invade them because under a democracy
everyone had a right to a house. That was their understanding of democracy.
It shows that the development of democracy is very much a matter of
education and of progressing step by step.
This approach does not mean there is no freedom or justice. Doing it by
stages means first introducing it at the level of the schools and to avoid
making wrong steps. In this we are being successful. Democracy is a matter
of mentality and a way of life. People have to be taught.
Democracy is an overall concept. It is not just politics but also health
care, housing and the right to a job. There cannot be democracy without
development, and there cannot be development without democracy. But freedom
of expression alone does not necessarily bring jobs and drinking water for
the people.
If people are not mentally prepared for democracy it could be a catastrophe.
The examples elsewhere in the world are obvious. The fundamentalists are
basically the enemies of democracy. They struggle to take people back to the
Middle Ages and the days of the Islamic caliphate. Where is the democracy in
that?
According to the laws and constitution of Tunisia, there is no room for
religious parties. They will never happen here. We shall never embark on
this course. It would be a catastrophe for this country and its people if we
were ever to give permission for the formation of a religious party.
As long as I am here, as president or not, I will continue to combat the
creation of a religious party. That is my conviction.
Tunisia's links with Europe, the Arab world and north Africa
Tunisia's natural environment is constituted first by the Maghreb, then by
the Arab world. To deny this would be to deny our very identity. But it is
also true that Tunisia has always been linked economically with Europe,
which is our major supplier of equipment and technology and our favoured
partner in the commercial domain.
What is more, Tunisia is one of the favourite destinations of European
tourists. But these days there is also less room for co-operation among
single countries alone. Instead they are very much coming to be seen as part
of larger groupings. So we are trying to co-operate with the Maghreb Union,
which adds extra weight to our co-operation with the EU.
On establishing full diplomatic relations with Israel
Tunisia has unfailingly provided our Palestinian brothers and sisters with
active support for the re-establishment of their legitimate national rights.
Our relief and optimism at the signing of agreements between the PLO and
Israel were felt all the more strongly because of the considerable
contribution we made. It appears that the Palestinian problem is on the path
to a lasting political solution. But we cannot say the problem has been
truly solved until the Palestinians have recovered all their legitimate
rights. We will avoid making any hasty decisions that might compromise their
interests, and at the same time we will continue to provide our full support
for the peace process.
On the future of Tunisia
Previously an underdeveloped country, we have been successful in getting to
the intermediate stage and it is my ambition that we should be a member of
the family of democratic nations. That is a political decision. I have been
urging Tunisians to work harder. Now I am urging them to work better in
order to catch up with the developed countries, to be competitive with them,
especially in the event of there being a free trade zone with the European
Union. We have to enhance the quality of our goods. Whoever consumes what he
does not produce is not truly independent.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of Tunisia (5): The 'little by little' approach -
James Harding looks at the risks and rewards of privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Privatisation reveals the paradox at the heart of Tunisian economic policy.
In a country where the unemployed are feared as potential supporters of
Islamic extremism, the risk is that privatisation could swell those numbers
through the spread of private sector practices to former state-owned
industries. But on the other hand, privatisation offers a dynamic stimulus
to Tunisian prosperity and is seen officially as the most effective way to
dampen the appeal of religious fanaticism.
Commitment to economic liberalisation has been so tempered by a fear of
social dislocation that the privatisation programme in Tunisia has been, as
one western diplomat put it, 'excessively moderate in pace'. The banks, the
bourse and foreign investors, which wait for the government to give a boost
to this nascent market, privately wonder if vested interests in the
administration also slow the pace.
Forty-three companies have been privatised so far for TD176m. Sales of
hotels account for half this figure, followed by mechanical industries, food
processing and textiles. Most of the companies so far privatised are said to
be no longer losing money and have shed little labour.
Ministers insist that receipts from privatisation are not earmarked to cover
the budget deficit; hence they see no need for what they consider as 'grand
gestures' such as the public announcement of long lists of companies up for
sale.
Nevertheless, at least partial sell-offs are rumoured for state companies in
the chemicals, cement, phosphates, shipping and refinery industries.
Speculation about the sale of a stake in Tunis Air, the state carrier, has
been rife since the government delayed a decision following what it felt was
an unfavourable auditor's evaluation. Opinion is divided as to whether the
state will choose the now apparently profitable and domestically well-known
airline to spearhead the next round of sell-offs, or whether it will
continue piecemeal privatisation which does not threaten adverse publicity.
The financial infrastructure for more substantial divestment by the state is
being put in place. Legislation to establish an independent stock exchange
and securities watchdog is currently before the chamber of deputies and is
expected to take effect from September.
Traders on the bourse, on which 20 stocks are listed today in comparison
with 11 in 1990, believe privatisation will encourage private sector
companies to seek a quotation. A significant expansion in the volume of
stocks would confirm claims, based on the growth of market capitalisation
from Dollars 0.8bn in 1993 to Dollars 1.6bn in 1994, that Tunisia is an
emerging market.
Mr Ahmed Hadouej, president of the bourse, estimates that there are 200
companies in a position to consider coming to the market, even if many would
be on a preferential share basis. Corporate tax rates of 35 per cent,
tax-free dividends and avoidable capital gains tax mean that there is no
substantial disincentive for private owners to meet the transparency
requirements for the stock exchange. However, until privatisation boosts
market liquidity, stockholder capital injection does not outweigh the
advantages of individual control.
Investment fund managers, a growing breed in Tunisia, also wait for the
privatisation fillip. According to Mr Hadouej, there is now Dollars 300m in
15 open-ended funds and Dollars 300m in 65 closed-ended funds investing
primarily in bonds, government bonds and treasury bills. For international
investors, however, critical mass requires a weightier body of equities.
On September 1, Tunisie Leasing, a local fund manager, and Kidder Peabody,
the US investment bank, will launch Tuninvest, the first fund for foreign
investors aimed solely at Tunisia. Representatives of the fund predict an
annual return of as much as 20 per cent based on bourse trading and equity
stake purchases. Their only concern is an over-supply of capital which
neither the small Tunisian exchange nor large companies reluctant to float
would be able to absorb.
Those eager to invest but anxious about the slowness of privatisation are
encouraged by Mr Mustapha Nabli, minister for planning and regional
development, to consider investment opportunities in infrastructure.
The management of the 150km highway from Tunis to Sousse as a toll road
requires Dollars 30m investment from a private company. Government plans to
extend the network with a further 300km of motorway construction offer an
investment opportunity of Dollars 600m over the next five to six years.
Following the success of land reclamation from the northern inland lake in
Tunis, the government will be seeking investors for reclamation of land
around the southern lake and in Taparora in Sfax. Both projects will be open
to private, foreign investors and, according to Mr Nabli, 'any formula is
being considered'.
This warm welcome for infrastructural investment contrasts with the cautious
tone on privatisation. Mr Nabli, along with Mr Nouri Zorgati, finance
minister, and Mr Mohamed Ghannouchi, minister for international co-operation
and foreign investment, are thought to be keen supporters of economic
liberalisation.
Nevertheless, 'petit a petit' (little by little), which is anyway the
favoured phrase of Tunisian officialdom, is nowhere repeated more frequently
than in conversations about privatisation.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of The Bank of England (6): Emu may not be dead after
all - Martin Wolf discusses the feasibility of stage three of the Maastricht
Treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has become a commonplace in the UK that economic and monetary union is so
distant a possibility as to be irrelevant. Some continental politicians,
notably in Germany, seem to agree that the Maastricht timetable is no longer
realistic. The main reason people argue that Emu is off the agenda is that
member states will not be able to meet the criteria on inflation, interest
rates, exchange rates and fiscal policy laid down in the treaty.
This judgment is likely to prove quite wrong with a profound effect on the
future of the Bank of England.
The average of the Commission's forecast 1994 inflation for the three best
performers (France, Denmark and the Netherlands) is 2 per cent. Germany, the
UK, Belgium, Ireland and Luxembourg all meet the criterion that their
inflation be within 1.5 per cent of this level. In early July, the average
bond yield of the three lowest inflation countries (which are not the three
countries with the lowest bond yields) was around 7.75 per cent. The
interest rate criterion - that bond rates be within 2 percentage points of
the average for the three lowest inflation countries - was met by Germany,
the UK, Belgium, Ireland and Luxembourg (the latter automatically, by virtue
of its monetary union with Belgium). In short, eight countries already meet
these criteria.
The requirement on exchange rates was that 'a member state has respected the
normal fluctuation margins provided for by the exchange rate mechanism of
the European Monetary System without severe tensions for at least the two
years before the examination'. It may have been serendipity, but the wider
bands can now be used to define what is normal. Those with an excellent
chance of meeting this criterion are Germany, France, the Benelux countries,
Denmark and Ireland.
At first glance, fiscal policy is the obstacle. The treaty offers two
reference values, '3 per cent for the ratio of the planned or actual
government deficit to gross domestic product at market prices' and '60 per
cent for the ratio of government debt to gross domestic product at market
prices'.
The Commission forecasts that Luxembourg and Ireland should meet the first
criterion this year, though Germany and the Netherlands will be close (at
3.1 and 3.6 per cent, respectively). The public debt criterion should be met
this year by Germany, France, Luxembourg, the UK, though Spain (at 64.2 per
cent), Denmark (at 68.5 per cent) and Portugal (at 70.6 per cent) come
close.
If unchanged, the fiscal position would appear to preclude Emu by early
1997, when a majority of the members need to meet the criteria if there is
to be a union. Furthermore, if Emu is to start in January 1999, regardless
of the number who meet the criteria, as intended in the treaty, there might
be few participants. A monetary union between Germany and Luxembourg would
seem a definition of futility.
This analysis is misleading because the 'excessive deficit' procedure, of
which the fiscal reference values are essential components, is highly
judgmental. Furthermore, responsibility for monitoring the member states
falls on the Commission, a far from disinterested party. It will be quite
easy for the Commission to argue that without the recent recession Belgium,
France, the UK and Denmark would meet the deficit criterion. All could, in
any case, cut their deficits to meet it; most already have plans to do so.
These countries can then be added to Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg and the
Netherlands, which already either meet or almost meet the deficit criterion.
Furthermore, as recovery proceeds, deficits should shrink.
Deficits can be adjusted quite swiftly, if need be. Barring default, ratios
of public debt to GDP cannot be adjusted so swiftly. Furthermore, three
member states have ratios of above 100 per cent - Greece (110 per cent),
Italy (120 per cent) and Belgium (146 per cent). The Netherlands has a ratio
of 81 per cent and Ireland one of 88 per cent, both well above the 60 per
cent reference point.
The question is whether the debt ratio will be judged to be 'sufficiently
diminishing'. If a country has a large enough primary budget surplus - a
surplus, excluding interest payments - the ratio will at least diminish. Of
the relatively high debt countries, Ireland and Belgium both had substantial
primary budget surpluses (of close to 4 per cent of GDP) last year, the
Netherlands one of 2.3 per cent of GDP and Italy one of 2 per cent. In 1996,
the Commission is likely to argue that the eight countries that already meet
the inflation and interest rate criteria also meet the fiscal criteria.
Admittedly, the point will be stretched for Belgium. But it is already clear
that the others are likely to be cleared, since the Commission has proposed
that Ireland not be deemed to fail the fiscal tests, despite the country's
high indebtedness, because of its low fiscal deficit.
The Maastricht treaty offers two dates on the move to the third stage of
Emu. The first is not later than December 31, 1996, by when the Council,
acting by qualified majority, shall decide 'whether a majority of the member
states fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of a single
currency'. It seems likely that seven members - Belgium, Denmark, France,
Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands - will be judged to meet
the criteria. The UK may fail the ERM criterion (by virtue of not being a
member), but might meet the others. Denmark and the UK also have opt-outs.
Opt-out or no opt-out, the Bank of England may be enjoying no more than an
Indian summer of semi-independence. It could well find itself locked in the
iron embrace of Emu before the end of the decade.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of The Bank of England (7): The driving force behind
shake-up / Profile of Rupert Pennant-Rea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rupert Pennant-Rea's recruitment as deputy-governor in 1993, from the
editorship of the Economist, caused considerable surprise. True, he had
worked at the Bank in the mid-1970s, but before that he had worked as an
official at the General and Municipal Workers' Union.
The Bank has traditionally liked to have an outsider in one of its two top
posts, and with Eddie George being promoted from within, the deputy-governor
needed to be an external candidate. But rather than the conventional choice
of a clearing banker, Norman Lamont opted for Pennant-Rea, a journalist.
Former deputy-governor Sir Kit McMahon described the choice as 'a
breathtaking insult to the Bank'.
However, there was a certain logic to the move. The Economist, where
Pennant-Rea became editor from 1986, regards itself as a cut above most
newspapers, rather as the Bank looks down loftily on the clearers.
Pennant-Rea personified the 'journalist as detached thinker' approach in
which the Economist specialises; he was expected therefore to add some
vigour to the policy debates at the Bank.
In fact, much of his first year has been taken up with the old fashioned
deputy-governor's task of managing the Bank. He was the driving force behind
the Bank's reorganisation, which involved him in hard decisions, both at the
macro level (the demise of the old international division) and at the micro
level (the departure of a number of senior staff).
His journalistic skills have shown up in a change of tone. Central bankers'
public utterances are renowned for conveying as little information as
possible in a generally turgid style. Pennant-Rea's speeches (which he
writes himself) even essay the odd joke - for example, 'monetary restraint
is not a hair-shirt but it has to be a habit' - and a daring note of
candour: 'At the Bank of England, we are merely part of the supply lines. As
such, we have the ability to mess things up - and our record shows we have
often used it.'
Former colleagues say his style is little changed by his move to the Bank -
his pullovers still flout the normal conventions of City attire. 'He is one
of life's immutable people,' according to one, while those who know him now
say 'he still has a slightly undergraduate air'. His informality means that
Bank staff address him as 'Rupert' rather than the traditional 'Mr Deputy'.
But some of his opinions have changed. The Economist took the line that the
Bank should not be involved in banking supervision, but Pennant-Rea
confessed to the Treasury and Civil Service select committee that he had
been converted to the Bank view.
Friends say he is enjoying the job tremendously and is getting on well with
Eddie George. He himself has hinted that he expects to be in the job for
only five years or so, and in one interview, indicated that his previous
career was not ideal training for the present job. 'My temperament is
conditioned by the last 16 years as a journalist, which is a world of quick
decisions and strong words,' he said. 'A central banker needs to be more
silent and unrevealing. I am not very good at that.'

FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of The Bank of England (5): Affability with a hint of
steel / Profile of Eddie George
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once upon a time, governors of the Bank of England were haughty,
aristocratic figures. The pink-tailed footmen who roam the halls of the Bank
seemed appropriate guardians of one of the crown's most mighty subjects.
Nowadays, central banking is more a matter of understanding the difference
between the implied GDP deflator and the producer prices index, than knowing
the right direction in which to pass the port.
Eddie George is one of the new breed. A technician, who has worked at the
Bank (with occasional outside secondments) for 32 years, he is fully
equipped to debate the minutiae of monetary policy with his expert
underlings.
As to aristocratic hauteur, he is sufficiently aware of the demands of a
democratic age to submit to the indignity of a television interview with
Brian Walden.
Indeed, if the Bank wishes to gain public acceptance for an independent
role, Eddie George is an ideal front man. As his nickname 'steady Eddie'
attests, he exudes an air of reliability, the old-fashioned bank branch
manager writ large. A more intellectually, or socially, arrogant man might
provoke a backlash against the loss of democratic sovereignty inherent in
granting the Bank independence.
Behind the public air of affability, however, there is more than a hint of
steel. His management style has been described as autocratic and his
economic opinions are firmly held.
He genuinely believes that 'inflation is theft' and he took the unusual
action of agreeing to a five-year pay freeze when he was appointed in 1993.
Before he became deputy-governor in 1990, George was executive director of
home finance, heading a small team in charge of policy-making and the
day-to-day management of financial markets.
Ironically, it is in this area of handling financial markets where he has
received some criticism as governor. The timing of the interest rate cut in
February, responsibility for which was in the Bank's hands, was perceived by
the markets as political, coinciding as it did with a difficult period for
the Conservative party.
It then gradually emerged that Eddie George had opposed the cut and, indeed,
speculation on the issue was one of the reasons the Chancellor agreed to
publication of the minutes of the monthly monetary meeting. Those minutes
showed that the Bank was consistently more optimistic about growth, and more
pessimistic about inflation, than the Treasury.
George has been criticised in the press, and by some brokers' analysts, for
his caution about inflation which, some feel, has prevented interest rates
from falling fast enough to give the UK a buoyant recovery.
Certainly, the Bank of England's short-term forecasts, contained in its
quarterly inflation reports, have proved consistently over-pessimistic.
When the next upturn in inflation arrives, George can expect more jibes on
the grounds that he was too dilatory in raising rates. The price of greater
Bank freedom is eternal criticism.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of The Bank of England (4): Accountability is core
issue - Philip Coggan examines the debate about possible independence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British economic policy debates are rarely short of what Americans call the
'high concept' solution - an idea that can be explained in a sentence.
In the past, the panaceas have varied from incomes policies through monetary
targets to membership of the exchange rate mechanism. The current 'high
concept' is Bank of England independence.
Only with an independent Bank, enthusiasts argue, can monetary policy be
freed from the interfering and inflationary hands of politicians. Only with
an independent Bank can monetary policy have the credibility to convince
sceptical international financial markets.
Enthusiasts point to the long-running, anti-inflationary success of the
Bundesbank and, more recently, to the record of New Zealand, where the
central bank has been given a precise 0-2 per cent inflation target.
In part, however, the tide of enthusiasm for Bank independence stems from
the shock created when the pound was forced out of the exchange rate
mechanism in September 1992. ERM membership had been the cornerstone of the
government's economic policy. A replacement strategy was needed - and
quickly.
Norman Lamont's decision was to give a greater role in policy to the Bank.
The publication of a quarterly inflation report by the Bank, accompanied by
an official inflation target of 1-4 per cent, was the centrepiece of the new
strategy. Kenneth Clarke, Lamont's successor, has steadily increased the
Bank's autonomy. The Bank now has the power to set the timing, if not the
direction or size, of interest rate changes. The minutes of the monthly
monetary meetings between the governor and the chancellor are now published,
six weeks after the event. This should, so the theory goes, make it clear
when the chancellor is ignoring the governor's advice and pursuing for his
own political motives a monetary policy which was too lax.
But while the government has allowed this steady trend towards de facto
independence, it has shown only modest enthusiasm for making that
independence de jure.
The issue of accountability is at the core of the debate. Bank independence
involves the ceding of control over important areas of economic policy to
unelected bankers, whose sympathies are more likely to be in tune with bond
investors than, say, the long-term unemployed.
After Norman Lamont's resignation speech, in which the former chancellor
called for Bank independence, John Major said that 'were a way to be found
to get the benefits of an independent central Bank without the loss of
parliamentary accountability, my views would be very close to that of my Rt
Hon Friend'.
The Treasury view has been that considerable steps have already been taken
to give the Bank autonomy and these need to be 'bedded down' and assessed,
before any further moves towards independence are contemplated.
Nevertheless, there is a fair head of steam behind the independence idea. As
well as Norman Lamont, another former chancellor, Lord Lawson, has come out
in support thereof. City support was shown by a Centre for Economic Policy
Research paper in 1993, which proposed that the Bank should have full
control of short-term interest rates, subject to emergency powers which the
government (with parliamentary approval) could invoke.
Both Eddie George, the governor, and the deputy-governor, Rupert
Pennant-Rea, have backed the idea, albeit with the proviso that independence
would be useless without a general anti-inflationary consensus. Quoted in
the spring issue of Central Banking, Mr Pennant-Rea said: 'What we are
really after is a greater appreciation of the benefits of a stable
macroeconomic background and anything that contributes to that better
understanding is a good thing. Frankly, until we have that understanding
spread across quite a wide range of informed opinion and parliamentary
opinion, you shouldn't be talking about independence as an imminent
possibility.'
The tercentenary has created the opportunity for some subtle lobbying in
favour of independence. One of the papers in the Bank's tercentenary
symposium, from Stanley Fischer, the soon-to-be deputy-managing director of
the International Monetary Fund, made a strong pro-independence case.
'The evidence leaves little doubt that, on average, economic performance is
better in countries with more independent central banks,' argued Mr Fischer,
concluding that 'on her 300th birthday, it is time for the Old Lady to be
allowed to take on the responsibilities of independence.'
Mr Fischer's paper sets out the intellectual case for Bank independence.
First, he argues there has been an inflationary bias in the economic policy
of most countries. One reason is seignorage, the revenue which flows to
governments from the creation of money.
A second cause may be dynamic inconsistency, the tendency for governments to
promise one thing (such as low inflation) and deliver another. Years of
experience have persuaded the public not to believe government
pronouncements on fighting inflation, and to act accordingly. Inflationary
expectations are thus built into wages and prices, making it all the more
difficult for inflation to be reduced.
Whatever the academic merits of the issue, independence for the Bank is
clearly a political matter. The chances must be that it will take another
failure of economic policy - for example, a long period in which inflation
exceeds the present 1-4 per cent target - before there is a real chance of
the Bank getting its wish.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of Tunisia (4): Milestones on the road to free trade
 -James Harding on the pace of progress in negotiations with the European
Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tunisia is negotiating a partnership agreement with the European Union aimed
at establishing a free trade area. Although Tunisians relish the prestige of
being acknowledged as an equal competitor and look forward to an increase in
foreign investment, they qualify their enthusiasm with concern that
reciprocal free access will present a stiff challenge to domestic producers
while boosting European importers.
Closer ties are the natural expression of EU-Tunisia trade - 79.8 per cent
of Tunisian exports in 1993 went to Europe, up from 77.4 per cent in 1992,
while European goods represented 71.6 per cent of Tunisian imports in 1993,
slightly up from 71.1 per cent in 1992.
However, both sides recognise the need to tread gently. One EU diplomat
estimated that 'if we were to open the Tunisian market tomorrow, between 60
and 70 per cent of industry would close.' The 1976 co-operation agreement
gave Tunisia free access to the European market, but allowed it to maintain
high tariffs and quantitative restrictions protecting domestic industry.
Despite protective measures, which have been scaled down in recent years, a
European Commission report estimates that the Tunisian trade deficit with
the EU grew from TD727.5m in 1989 to TD1,414.8m in 1993. European imports
have grown in value from TD2,776.7m in 1989 to TD4,462.3m in 1993,
outstripping Tunisian exports to Europe which were up from TD2,049.2m to
TD3,047.5m in the same period.
The Tunisian government makes two requests of its European partners to help
it achieve the structural adjustment necessary to meet the conditions of
full liberalisation.
The first is time. Earlier this month, the two parties entered the third
round of negotiations since March, but EU officials say they have yet to
reach 'a level of detailed discussion'. Nevertheless, they intend to agree a
text by the end of 1994 with a view to seeing its implementation in 1996.
The establishment of a full free trade area with total dismantling of
customs tariffs is not expected for 15 years. Yet observers expect even this
timetable may slip.
The second requirement is an increase in aid for a further structural
adjustment programme. Since 1989, Tunisia has received Ecu743m, of which
Ecu324m was in grants from the European Commission and Ecu419m in loans from
the European Investment Bank.
Because of fund constraints, EU officials recommend that spending shift from
agriculture to investment in job creation and programmes to help industry
meet European quality, environmental and technological requirements.
More sensitive than the question of further EU grants is the future of the
olive oil quota. Although the EU has renewed the quota for 1995-96, Tunisia
is understood to be seeking an increase in the quantity guaranteed for
purchase from 46,000 to 60,000 tonnes. As yet, EU officials say that no
solution acceptable to both parties has been found.
Despite these disagreements, Tunisia stands to make considerable gains from
the partnership. The World Bank predicts significant medium-term benefits in
the form of greater foreign direct investment and financial flows.
In the long term, the elimination of outstanding customs barriers will lift
the competitiveness of the Tunisian economy. The EU partnership agreement
should encourage the removal of restrictions and liberalisation of tariffs.
By the end of 1993, only 42 per cent of agricultural and manufacturing
production was protected by quantitative restrictions compared with 72 per
cent in 1991. Tunisian officials predict these will be eradicated by 1995,
although the World Bank makes the more moderate estimate of a reduction to
25 per cent. Tariffs, too, are set to be dismantled, albeit using a
mechanism which subsidises liberalisation by implementing an additional
tariff at a 43 per cent rate for a limited period of three years.
The Gatt council, in a report last month, congratulated Tunisia on its
policy of unilateral liberalisation since the mid-1980s. However, it points
out: 'Tunisia's trade policies still seem far from neutral.' Moreover, the
country's comparative advantage in labour costs and proximity to Europe is
being challenged by east European and Asian producers. The report notes:
'The lack of diversity in trade patterns adds to the vulnerability of the
Tunisian economy to external factors, such as the current slowdown in
European markets.'
If Tunisian commerce is to succeed, it must go beyond Europe; 'the future of
an outward-looking Tunisia extends beyond the frontiers of the Mediterranean
into a wider multilateral world'. Ironically, nothing is more likely to
enable Tunisia to compete in the global marketplace and release it from its
dependence on Europe than the trade liberalisation that comes with an EU
partnership agreement.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of Tunisia (2): The gods are still smiling - Francis
Ghiles looks at the country's economic performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite a severe drought during the past 12 months, which will shave an
estimated 1-1.5 per cent off the growth rate of Tunisia's gross domestic
product this year, the gods are still smiling on its economic performance.
Eight years into the structural adjustment backed by the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank, Tunisia's economy is expected to chalk up a
growth rate of 5 per cent, more than twice the rate of increase of its
population (1.85 per cent). This should allow the creation of virtually all
the 62,000 jobs needed annually to avoid a rise in unemployment, which
affects just under 16 per cent of the workforce.
The budget deficit as a percentage of GDP has been cut from 5.2 per cent on
average in the mid-1980s to 3.3 per cent in 1993 and is expected to fall to
1.9 per cent this year. Government expenditure will decline from 37.1 to
35.6 per cent of GDP in 1994. Meanwhile, the tax take continues to rise.
Direct taxes account for TD700m, a quarter of the total, and income from
this source grows by 25 per cent every year. Overall, the introduction of
VAT and the lowering of tax thresholds are yielding handsome dividends.
Exports rose by 26.5 per cent in the first half of this year to TD2bn,
fuelled by a better performance of the manufacturing sector where many firms
in the textile and electronics sectors have become more competitive, and
benefiting from a better economic climate in the European Union, which
accounts for 77 per cent of all Tunisian exports. The state monopoly on
olive oil sales was abolished last year. Private entrepreneurs have actively
marketed existing stocks which were exceptionally large because of last
year's bumper crop. Receipts from tourism are expected to rise by a fifth
this year to TD1.34bn while remittances from Tunisians working abroad should
increase to TD680m.
While such figures may lack the glamour offered by the performance of
south-east Asian economies, steady growth provides a key to Tunisia's
economic and social stability. A recent IMF study on Tunisia's experience of
reform, 'The path to convertibility and growth', suggests other key factors
are at play. Three, in particular, are worth noting.
The thorough preparation of reforms has made for relatively smooth
implementation. This, in turn, requires a strong civil service. Tunisia's
investment in education after independence has paid off. Furthermore,
although real salaries in the civil service were eroded after 1986, the
government-brokered wage pacts prevented a major brain drain from the public
to the private sector which would have reduced the government's
implementation capacity. Finally, adequate social security systems and
safety nets have played a key role in avoiding an erosion in public support
for the process of economic adjustment. Foreign investment has grown, though
much of it is accounted for by projects in the energy sector. Last year's
slowdown is, in the view of senior ministers, a reflection of the
restructuring and recapitalisation currently under way in Tunisian private
firms. They believe it is now starting to pick up.
Prudent external debt policies have improved Tunisia's debt service ratio
and reduced debt service payments, as a percentage of exports of goods and
services, from 28 per cent in 1986 to below 20 per cent today. Two years
ago, Tunisia re-entered the international financial markets by securing a
Dollars 100m syndicated loan; earlier this year, it raised its first Samurai
bond, for Y30bn, and now it is preparing the ground for a credit rating with
Standard and Poor's and Moody's which will allow it to raise a US domestic
bond or a eurobond.
Privatisation is proceeding, albeit in the eyes of some observers, at a slow
pace. Forty-three companies have been privatised so far for TD176m. Sales of
hotels account for half this figure, followed by mechanical industries, food
processing and textiles.
Ministers insist that receipts from privatisation are not earmarked to cover
the budget deficit; hence they see no need for what they consider as 'grand
gestures' such as the public announcement of long lists of companies up for
sale. Most of the companies so far privatised are said to be no longer
losing money and have shed little labour.
Selling stakes in companies such as Tunis Air and the cement plants is
expected to be the next step. Tunisian caution on this front is also
dictated by the fact that most of the leading businessmen in Tunis know what
their peers are up to, because of extensive family links. This makes the
government wary about the risk of turning a public monopoly into an
unofficial private cartel. The president is, according to senior economic
advisers, determined to stay the course of economic reform, albeit at a pace
he feels he can politically afford.
It is not only the economic and trade figures that are changing. A new
generation of younger, better educated entrepreneurs is taking over, many of
whom speak English. They are exploring markets beyond the traditional EU
ones, most notably in south-east Asia and northern Europe. A large
delegation of businessmen has just come back from South Africa.
Some Tunisians wish that Utica, the employers' federation, was less beholden
to companies which grew up behind tariff barriers and more supportive of
those which are battling to sell Tunisian products abroad. Nonetheless, a
quiet revolution is afoot, which has not only witnessed the rise of younger,
better-educated men to senior cabinet posts, but also the drawing of talent
for government service from all the regions of the country.
The Sahel region, from which former President Habib Bourguiba came, is no
longer over-represented, and the south and west of Tunisia have powerful
voices in the senior echelons. These changes also reflect the head of
state's concern to see that the poorer regions do not feel left out of the
general slow rise in prosperity. Helping these regions may not be strictly
'economical' but, in the eyes of senior Tunisians, redressing the balance
which has so longer favoured the coastal regions is essential to the
country's longer-term prosperity.
Senior ministers feel they have laid the groundwork to steady growth. Tariff
barriers have come down, and the bulk of imports has been freed, as shops in
the major cities bear witness. Such displays may excite the envy of some,
but they provide a vital element which is prodding domestic producers into
improving the quality of what they sell and learning the commercial ways of
the modern world.
Nothing better illustrates the new climate than the decision by the private
Loukil Group to offer 10 per cent of its shares through a public offering on
the stock exchange earlier this month. Private companies have traditionally
been based on family networks. Increasing the capital of such groups and
opening them up to a broader range of shareholders are essential if
Tunisia's private sector is to meet the challenge of world markets.
Some seasoned observers of the Tunisian scene believe the next step the
country's leader should take is to encourage the larger private Tunisian
groups to play a more visible and active role in economic relations with
foreign partners.
They complain that fear of what is going on in neighbouring Algeria, as much
as any other consideration, is making the government too cautious. That
caution may frustrate the rising breed of bolder, modern Tunisian
entrepreneurs but, when the economic achievements of the past eight years
are taken into account, it could well turn out not to have been a bad thing.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of The Bank of England (3): Wings spread for
stability - Peter Norman analyses the recent management restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the beginning of this month the Bank of England underwent its biggest
management restructuring since 1980.
Most of its activities, which previously were scattered through numerous
separate divisions, have been concentrated in two 'wings', one responsible
for achieving monetary stability, the other charged with securing financial
stability.
The changes, which took effect 12 months after Mr Eddie George became
governor, with Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea as his deputy, reflect the
preoccupations of both men. They want to secure lasting low inflation, a
solid financial system and efficient and competitive financial markets in
Britain.
The restructuring is intended to create a leaner, more focused bank. One
important aspect has been to bring the Bank's operational and analytical
work closer together to make it better able to respond to rapid changes and
incipient dangers in the world economy and financial markets.
Mr Pennant-Rea, brought into the Bank from the Economist newspaper in 1993,
was responsible for planning the changes. The exercise began last December
during a weekend brainstorming session of top Bank managers at Ashridge
management college in Hertfordshire. In the following months, details were
thrashed out in three working groups which reported to the deputy governor.
The immediate challenge for Mr George and Mr Pennant-Rea is to secure
support for the changes inside the Bank. As the July deadline approached it
became increasingly clear that the reorganisation had created unhappiness,
even among senior officials who recognised that the Old Lady was ready for a
shake-up.
Bank staff were prey to considerable uncertainty during the planning of the
reorganisation. Although there have been no compulsory redundancies, the
restructuring has resulted in the departure of nine of the Bank's 45 most
senior officials. It is expected to prompt the departure of another 10 to 15
of the 150 high level managers just below head of division level. Further
down the institution, the reorganisation will cost about 80 jobs among the
Bank's clerical staff.
The changes are causing one departure at the level just below deputy
governor: Mr Hugh Harris, an associate director, is to take early
retirement. However, the Bank's four executive directors have prospered
under the changes and continue in office. Two have been assigned to each of
the wings.
The monetary stability wing is headed by Mr Mervyn King, the Bank's chief
economist, and Mr Ian Plenderleith, its markets guru. Its responsibilities
extend from economic and monetary analysis of the UK and other countries,
through preparation of the bank's monetary policy advice to the government
and its quarterly inflation report, to the implementation of monetary policy
in the financial markets.
The financial stability wing comes under Mr Brian Quinn, the Bank's long
serving head of supervisory activities, and Mr Pen Kent, the man responsible
for the UK's financial infrastructure. This wing brings together all the
Bank's supervision work, including the surveillance of markets and foreign
financial systems, its work on payment, settlement and clearing systems and
liaison with other regulators in the UK and overseas.
The financial stability wing also reflects the Bank's interest in the
efficiency and competitiveness of the UK financial system, including Crest,
the Bank's project for stock exchange settlements.
There is a central services area in addition to the wings. This covers the
Bank's own finances, personnel, the information division and the centre for
banking studies, the Bank's university for teaching central banking.
The changes have resulted in the creation of a new rank of deputy director,
below executive director. The five deputy directors - Mr Graham Kentfield,
Mr John Townend, Mr Bill Allen, Mr Michael Foot and Mr Alastair Clark - look
as if they will be the next generation of top managers at the Bank.
The most striking institutional change has been the disbandment of the
Bank's international division and the integration of its work into the two
main wings. A look at the Bank's new organogram also reveals that there is
no longer an economics division, although several departments deal with
economic issues.
For those responsible for the restructuring, these changes symbolise the
point of the whole exercise.
On the economic side, for example, the Bank has given up large scale
macro-economic modelling in favour of closer study of specific issues. The
changes are intended to involve the economists more closely with the Bank's
operations in the financial markets.
The disbanding of the international division reflects a belief that it had
become a hindrance rather than a help to the Bank's main goal of achieving
monetary and financial stability. Critics argued that the division had
developed into an 'in-house foreign office' which had become detached from
the bank's main work.
Now, rather than send specialists to international meetings, Bank staff from
the governor down will be involved in international representation.
However, it is perhaps significant that no other large central bank has so
far felt the urge to follow the Bank of England's lead and scrap its
international division.
There are also concerns in Threadneedle Street that the Bank may be
sacrificing some unique skills. While the maintenance of London-based
country experts for far flung locations may seem a luxury, it has paid
dividends in the past. In 1980, for example, the US turned to the Bank to
act as an intermediary with Iran in discussions over the return of frozen
Iranian assets in the US. The Bank's action helped pave the way for the end
of the Teheran hostage crisis and generated goodwill in the US.
It will be some time before the effects of the Ashridge restructuring become
clear. But it would be unwise to assume it marks the end of change at the
Bank.
The Bank's role and structure would be affected if ever there were moves
within the UK to give it more formal independence.
Then there is the Maastricht Treaty and its goal of a single European
currency and central bank. At present European economic and monetary union
seems a distant prospect and UK involvement unlikely. But will that always
be the case?
In the meantime, however, Mr George and Mr Pennant-Rea have stamped their
ideals and aspirations very firmly on an ancient institution. They now have
to ensure that their controversial restructuring produces the hoped-for
results.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of The Bank of England (2): More alert and
questioning - John Gapper on the supervisory role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two important anniversaries for the Bank fall this summer, in addition to
the tercentenary.
One is the 20th anniversary of the formation of a banking supervision
department. The other is the third anniversary of the traumatic closure of
the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI).
Banking supervision was born out of crisis - the secondary banking crisis of
1973-74 - and remains an activity prone to scandal and upset. But the three
years since the BCCI debacle have been especially testing for the 250
supervisors who oversee the operations of 488 domestic and foreign-owned
banks in the UK.
This is partly because they have been absorbing a series of reforms intended
to meet criticisms of the Bank of England's supervisory style, made by Sir
Thomas Bingham in his inquiry into BCCI. But they have also had to operate
amid a public debate over whether they should do the job at all.
Although the Bingham criticisms were not followed by any visible change in
the senior ranks of banking supervisors, there has been a sea change in the
past year. The appointment last August of Michael Foot to succeed Roger
Barnes as head of banking supervision is the most visible sign.
Mr Foot, a 47-year-old career Bank of England man who had not worked in
supervision before, emphasises the change that has occurred. He talks of a
'more alert and questioning style' among officials who have traditionally
been less adversarial in their relations with banks than in other countries.
'There was an awful lot of good in what we did before, but there was a
feeling that we were too willing to take on trust everything that was said,'
he says. He argues that Bingham's call for the Bank to be able to switch to
a more aggressive style when demanded has been 'tremendously helpful'.
The Bank has resisted changing to US-style supervision, under which auditing
teams constantly examine banks' books. 'We are still nothing like the armies
of OCC (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) investigators who pretty
well live in some of the big US banks,' says Mr Foot.
But it has placed more emphasis on review teams, which can spend two or
three days reviewing systems and controls at an institution. About 120 such
visits are made each year, and staff have received fresh training in fraud
awareness to be able to pick up signs that something is amiss.
This effort has been reinforced by a special investigations unit,
established after the Bingham inquiry, composed of 11 accountants with
'forensic' skills in analysing accounts to detect signs of fraud. The unit,
headed by Mr Ian Watt, is not based within banking supervision, but supports
it.
Mr Watt argues that supervisors have been 'glad to have someone to turn to
if they suspect fraud'. Some 170 cases have been referred to the unit since
it was set up, about half of which have required some action. Mr Watt says
that it gets many tip-offs from suspicious bank employees.
Yet although the unit has referred a few cases to police, there have been no
prosecutions so far. Mr Watt argues that the unit's deterrent effect is
valuable in itself. But he admits it is 'important that people are brought
to account, and the public sees they are properly punished'.
Mr Watt says that senior managements of banks co-operate with the unit's
inquiries willingly because they usually suffer from the effects of fraud by
employees or customers. 'Most banks are very much with us in our work
because they are usually the victims of these things,' he says.
At the same time, the Bank faces growing complexity in its core task of
supervising honest institutions. This is because of technological
innovation, and the growing emphasis in banks on securities, treasury and
derivatives trading. These areas require greater sophistication among
supervisors.
The Bank has a traded markets team which examines models used by banks. Mr
Foot says the Bank 'clearly cannot compete on a financial basis' to recruit
specialists in derivatives who could earn more outside, but some are keen to
have a stint at the Bank on their employment record.
These developments in supervision are one of the reasons he advances for
retaining the function within the Bank. He says that the Bank's role at the
heart of London money markets and the gilts market gives its officials
practical experience of financial markets rather than relying on theory.
The Bank's critics have two arguments for stripping it of supervision. One
is that financial boundaries are blurring, and banks should be regulated by
the same supervisor as securities firms and others. The other is that the
Bank's monetary role can conflict with its supervisory one.
Mr Foot admits that the structure of self-regulation for other bodies under
the 1986 Financial Services Act is still new - and 'not as intellectually
attractive' as having a single unified regulator. But he argues that the
main task is to ensure that regulatory efforts are well co-ordinated.
He cites relations with the Building Societies Commission, which he says
cause no difficulties of 'things disappearing down the cracks between us'.
He argues that other links must be developed similarly. 'We need to ensure
that our relations with all regulators are on the same basis,' he says.
On the second argument - that a central bank might hold back from deflating
an over-heated economy if banks would be bankrupted by asset price deflation
 -Mr Foot says the institutional arrangements are irrelevant. Such pressures
would 'emerge somewhere' in a monetary crisis.
The Bank's supervisors are able to celebrate the various anniversaries that
fall this summer without a sense of doom.
Despite the difficulties of BCCI, they have adapted their style and methods
enough to satisfy most critics without transforming the institution
completely.
Mr Foot emphasises the Bank's determination not to switch to 'ghastly
over-regulation' because of pressures to prevent scandals and collapse. Its
role remains primarily to protect depositors. 'A level playing field does
not mean that we have to smooth out every bump on the surface,' he says.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of Tunisia (1): First steps taken to a place in the
developed world - Tunisia, an oasis of calm and economic growth in spite of
the political troubles that have affected neighbouring Algeria, hopes to
retain its political stability under President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's
leadership
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Tunisian government appears confident that it is getting many things
right, not least its vocabulary.
To western ears, the language sounds reassuringly familiar. Words such as
democracy, pluralism, privatisation, deregulation, modernisation and
structural adjustment trip off the official tongue with a persistence which
highlights the European-oriented ambitions of a nation increasingly less
enthusiastic about being identified primarily as Arab and north African.
But family and neighbours are hard to ignore, and Tunisia can do little
about either. On one border looms the large, unstable bulk of Algeria; on
the other the perverse, mercurial Libya of Col Muammar Gaddafi. Few of the
words which Tunisia employs to identify itself can fairly be used with
reference to either of its neighbours. As a result, and much to its
irritation, Tunisia finds its external image blighted by geographical
association.
Domino theorists, fashionable in south-east Asia before the collapse of
communism, are seeking to stoke similar fears about the surge of Islamic
fundamentalism in the Middle East. The strong electoral showing of the
fundamentalist parties in Algeria, and the country's subsequent descent into
political anarchy after the government refused to accept the verdict of the
electorate, must inevitably have implications for its neighbours.
But, 15 years after the revolution in Iran, there is little evidence to
support the view that Islamic fundamentalism is an exportable commodity,
despite the best efforts of the government in Tehran. Rather, the phenomenon
is being increasingly recognised as a response to the failure of individual
governments to alleviate poverty and diminish huge disparities in the
distribution of wealth.
The lesson appears to have been well understood in Tunisia. President Zine
El Abidine Ben Ali, nearing seven years at the head of the Tunisian
government, likes to describe his approach to ensuring continued political
stability as 'multi-dimensional'.
On the one hand, he is adamant that no political party based on religion
will be permitted. Reports by international human rights organisations
indicate that activists pursuing such aims are sometimes dealt with in ways
that are scarcely compatible with the liberal image that Tunisia is seeking
to foster. Police checkpoints on major roads at night underline the message
that the government will not compromise on security.
On the other hand, there is now a very modest representation of
non-government parties in the national assembly following the March
elections, and an apparent acceptance at the most senior level that this
process will be extended as standards of education and economic development
improve. However, the pace of democratic change will, at best, be
exceedingly slow. President Ben Ali was himself re-elected with an
improbable 99.9 per cent of the vote, and one of the two candidates who
failed to secure sufficient nominations to run against him was later
imprisoned for three months following an interview he gave to a Spanish
newspaper.
The Tunisian government's sensitivity to opposition and criticism may be
understandable in the regional political context, but it sits less
comfortably alongside the ambitions of a country which over the past decade
has taken considerable strides in stabilising, restructuring and
liberalising its economy. Tunisia now bears favourable comparison with much
of Africa and the Middle East over the way it has managed the transition
from a rigid state-controlled economy to one that is more and more
export-oriented and in which the private sector plays a steadily increasing
role.
Ministers are concerned that Tunisia's achievements have been too little
appreciated internationally and that too few countries, especially in
western Europe, have yet identified it as a focus for investment and as a
regional service centre. Their sales pitch can be persuasive. Tunisia is
close to Europe, with some 75 per cent of its trade carried out with EU
members. Barriers to trade have been progressively lowered and current EU
negotiations have as their eventual target the conclusion of a free trade
agreement. The population of 8.74m provides a modest domestic market, but
Tunisia is also well placed to supply the larger African and eastern
Mediterranean region.
The implementation of the structural adjustment programme has since 1987 won
plaudits from both the IMF and the World Bank, and contributed significantly
to the resilience of the economy in overcoming the impact of drought and the
Gulf war. Despite those negative factors, real growth has averaged 5 per
cent a year since 1989, while the current account and budget deficits have
been reduced last year to 4 per cent and 2.4 per cent of GDP respectively.
Inflation is estimated to be running at a little over 3 per cent, and there
has been continued success in reducing the percentage of export earnings
needed to finance external debt.
Meanwhile, reforms to the financial sector have produced greater banking
flexibility, a simplified system for both direct and indirect taxation, a
more coherent investment code, and the first steps towards the creation of
diversified capital market. The challenge now for both the government and
Tunisia's entrepreneurs is how best to exploit the improved institutional
framework in order to give the country the export-led growth it needs to
reduce an unemployment level of at least 15 per cent of the workforce, and
satisfy new entrants to the labour market.
The regional political environment urges caution, but the intensity of
international competition for investment funds demands speed. Nowhere is
this better illustrated than in the debate over privatisation. Given
Tunisia's experience since independence, it is not surprising that there is
no ready-made majority in favour of divestment. In some quarters free
enterprise and capitalism are still too readily associated with colonialism.
Additionally, the trade unions, which enjoy a political legitimacy
unparalleled elsewhere in the Arab world, are wary of possible job losses,
as indeed is the government.
But without an official lead, the nation's biggest companies seem unlikely
to accept the degree of transparency and dilution of ownership inherent in a
stock exchange flotation. If the government is truly committed to creating a
dynamic equities market that will serve to channel capital resources into
more productive investment, it will sooner or later have to set a more
emphatic example and bite the political bullet.
However this, as with so many other issues, may be delayed until the
government is convinced that the risk element has been reduced to a minimum
and no threat is posed to what is broadly defined as 'national consensus'.
Part of that process also involves wider social aims such as better health
care and education, regional aid and the provision of a strengthened safety
net to catch the most deprived members of society, including the 500,000 who
have been identified as requiring official help. Labour laws are also in the
process of being reformed, so as to provide for clearer definitions on terms
of employment, dismissal and wage bargaining, in which the government will
continue to play a key arbitration role.
President Ben Ali, looking out from his office in Carthage over the
magnificent sweep of the Mediterranean below, gives every impression of
being satisfied with more than his immediate environment. He and his
ministers believe they are well on the way to putting into place the
structures which will enable Tunisia to claim, eventually, a place among
developed nations. Their confidence will be more reassuring should Tunisia's
neighbours ever come to think along similar lines.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of The Bank of England (1): The Old Lady has stepped
into the limelight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Old Lady has come out of the shadows for her 300th birthday.
Over the past two years, the Bank of England has achieved a position of rare
prominence in the affairs of the United Kingdom.
Although still subordinate to the government when determining monetary
policy, the Bank has acquired a position which makes it virtually impossible
for a Chancellor of the Exchequer to change interest rates for political
rather than economic reasons.
Its present governor, Mr Eddie George, a lifelong Bank man who moved up to
the top slot a year ago from the position of deputy, has become a public
figure in a way that few of his predecessors have done.
Nor is the Bank likely to drop out of the headlines. Bubbling in the
background is the debate over whether it should be given greater
independence.
It has become almost de rigueur for resigning chancellors to reveal that
they favoured freeing the Bank to run monetary policy independent of the
Treasury, although there is no sign that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the present
occupier of Number 11 Downing Street, has been persuaded to support the
idea.
In the past 12 months, a plethora of reports - from leading City figures,
the influential House of Commons Treasury and Civil Service Committee and Mr
Stanley Fischer, the distinguished US economist who is soon to become a
deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, among others -
have urged that the Bank should have greater autonomy over monetary policy
while being made more accountable to parliament.
In the middle distance, there is the possibility of European economic and
monetary union (Emu). This will require that the European Union's central
banks be independent before handing over responsibility for monetary policy
and a future single European currency to an independent European Central
Bank.
Although Britain can opt out of Emu, continuing pressure from Britain's EU
partners to move ahead with the project by the end of the century will help
keep the independence debate alive.
European developments have always had a profound impact on the Bank. It was,
after all, set up in 1694 to finance a war against France that was being
prosecuted by the Dutch-born King William III. Its first governor, John
Houblon, was a second generation Huguenot protestant, and therefore an exile
from France.
The Bank's recent emergence as a more significant participant in UK monetary
policy was the direct result of a European policy failure: the collapse of
British membership of the European exchange rate mechanism.
When sterling was forced out of the ERM in September 1992, the then
chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, moved swiftly to establish a new policy
framework for monetary policy.
His aim was to restore credibility in what was then the government's
overriding economic policy goal of bringing down inflation. The policy's
planks were greater openness and an enhanced role for the Bank.
The Lamont changes set a specific inflation target of 1 to 4 per cent for
retail price inflation excluding mortgage interest payments, with the aim of
having inflation in the lower half of the band by the end of this
parliament.
The dates of the chancellor's monthly meetings with the governor to discuss
monetary policy were made public and marked by the publication by the
Treasury of a monthly monetary report setting out the information on which
policy judgments were based.
The Bank was given responsibility for publishing a quarterly inflation
report to monitor progress towards achieving the inflation target, giving it
the opportunity to warn the government when it believes policies are wrongly
set to deliver price stability.
This opportunity was turned into a specific mandate when Mr George was named
as successor to Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton (now Lord Kingsdown) as governor in
January 1993.
Mr Lamont 'made clear to the new governor that his central responsibility
should be to support the government in its determination to bring about a
lasting reduction in the rate of inflation'.
The Bank's powers and responsibilities have increased further since Mr
Clarke became chancellor in May last year. Treasury vetting of the inflation
report was stopped in November 1993. About that time, Mr Clarke gave the
Bank the right to determine the precise timing of interest rate changes,
while retaining the decision over their direction and scale. In April this
year, the chancellor decided to publish the minutes of his monthly monetary
meetings with Mr George after a six-week delay, bringing an unprecedented
degree of openness to UK monetary policy.
In a short period, therefore, the bank has moved from being an instinctively
secretive institution to one that must expect to account for its actions and
advice to government.
The first batch of minutes to be released showed that chancellor and
governor could disagree over interest rates, although so far not to the
point of having a serious rift in a good working relationship.
Mr George has described publication of the minutes as 'a terrific step'. It
is hard to imagine any chancellor, present or future, being able to change
monetary policy for political reasons, at least as long as the incumbent
governor holds office. The Treasury has already had to get used to the Bank
governor staking out policy positions in public in an unusually forthright
manner. At last month's Mansion House speech to the merchants and bankers of
the City of London, Mr George almost upstaged the chancellor when he warned
that the next move in UK interest rates would be upwards.
Although the Bank's role of combating inflation through monetary policy has
hogged the headlines over the past two years, it is only part of its
activities. A controversial management restructuring that took effect at the
beginning of this month has emphasised that the Bank is as responsible for
securing financial stability and efficient and competitive financial markets
as it is for price stability.
The Bank's supervisory activities have been bolstered as part of its
internal reorganisation into two broad wings - one responsible for financial
stability and the other for monetary stability.
In particular, the shutting down of the international division - a measure
that has caused considerable anguish inside the Bank - has allowed the
redeployment of staff with foreign expertise in the financial stability
wing.
The retention and strengthening of the Bank's supervisory functions over the
banking sector are signs that the Old Lady has been able to absorb and
survive the criticism it incurred after the closure of Bank of Credit and
Commerce International (BCCI) in 1991.
As evidence of the trust placed in the Bank's expertise in financial
markets, the Treasury earlier this year gave the Bank greater freedom to
operate in the government bond market.
The Treasury now sets the guidelines on debt management and funding policy
but leaves the Bank free to choose the timing and nature of issues of
gilt-edged stock.
Although the enhanced focus on monetary and financial stability makes the
Bank look less like a conglomerate than it did, it is intimately bound up in
the future of its surrounding financial centre in a way that other central
banks are not.
One of its four executive directors, Mr Pen Kent, has been given
responsibility for the UK's financial infrastructure, including the
development of Crest, the Bank's successor to the ill-fated Taurus project
for a paperless settlement system that was developed and abandoned by the
stock exchange.
This broad base of activities gives the Bank some cause to think of an
institutional future stretching beyond its first 300 years.
Other European central banks, such as the Bundesbank with its more narrowly
defined objective of pursuing price stability, can be less confident of
having a significant role to play if Emu ever comes.

FT  27 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Food retailers firm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Food retail stocks were a generally bright picture as a combination of
broker upgrades and continuing takeover talk underpinned the sector. But
William Low was one weak spot as investors swayed over whether there would
be a counter bid to the Pounds 154m agreed offer from Tesco. Low shares slid
10 to 268p, with turnover reaching 3.5m. Tesco was 1 1/2 lighter at 236 1/2
p. J Sainsbury, which is currently considering whether to enter the fray for
Low's, added 5 to 411p. At the same time, the market's attention turned
towards another northern-based supermarket chain, Morrison Supermarkets, as
a potential alternative. The shares ended 3 ahead at 131p.
Elsewhere in the sector, both Hoare Govett and SG Warburg were making
positive noises on selected food stocks. The latter shifted to a buy on
Argyll Group, the shares responding with a rise of 3 1/2 to 272 1/2 p.
Profits forecast for the current year were raised by Pounds 16m to Pounds
400m, while the 1995-6 estimate was lifted the same amount to Pounds 440m.
The 13-year battle for control of the Savoy Group appeared to heat up as the
luxury hotel group announced that it had 'become aware of talks between
hotels group Forte and certain trusts, which have a significant shareholding
in The Savoy.' The statement added that the discussions could affect the
eventual management of the group. The news boosted Forte shares which closed
4 1/2 ahead at 231p on a hefty 7.7m traded. Savoy 'A' shares slipped 3 to
970p.
Analysts interpreted the terse statement as the management's response to
Forte's quiet but gathering campaign to wrest control of the Savoy, a
situation which has simmered since Forte's failed bid in 1981. The two camps
have a stand-off arrangement whereby Forte will give 12 months notice of a
hostile bid. Forte holds just over 42 per cent of voting rights in Savoy,
while Mr Rocco Forte, Forte's chief executive, sits on the Savoy board.
However, Forte's grand plan of creating a luxury hotel chain centred on the
Savoy group has been an open secret in leisure circles and lobbying of Savoy
shareholders has been taking place - a move confirmed by yesterday's
statement.
ICI, the UK's leading chemicals company edged a penny higher to 840p,
notching up a gain of 8.5 per cent over the past fortnight ahead of second
quarter figures tomorrow .
The shares have outperformed a rising FT-A All Share Index by five
percentage points over the same period and many dealers were beginning to
suggest that the company would have to pull something extra out of the hat
if it was to hold on to recent gains.
'The range is Pounds 110m to Pounds 140m with most of the City around Pounds
130m but the company historically disappoints and there could well be some
profit taking with the figures,' commented one seasoned chemicals analyst.
Support for BAT Industries, the tobacco and insurance conglomerate, moved
ahead in front of interims today. The shares improved 11 to 443p.
Elsewhere among internationally traded stocks, Reuters Holdings, which is
also expected to announce interim figures today, bounced 15 to 480p as a
heavy selling order carried out by one leading US house was said to have
been completed. Also, NatWest Securities reiterated its buy recommendation.
Forecasts for the half year profits range from Pounds 235m to Pounds 254m.
Barclays recovered from previous weakness as the shares took some heart from
a piece of research published by Smith New Court ahead of the sector's
results season which begins with Lloyds on Friday.
Smiths argue that: 'In a mature market with commoditised products banks are
showing signs of going ex-growth'. However, it believes Barclays will head
the cost cutting required and provide a seed bed for growing operating
profits. Barclays bounced 9 to 551p while Lloyds came off the top to close 7
better at 567p after 5762p earlier.
Automotive and aerospace group Lucas Industries shrugged off Monday's
weakness to close 3 1/2 ahead at 196 1/2 p, with Williams de Broe
recommending the shares. A slide early in the week was halted after the
company dismissed a press report that it was under investigation in the US
for falsifying inspection of parts for commercial aircraft.
Williams de Broe urged investors to buy the stock and cited the 'recovery
potential in the automotive business' for the recommendation.
Rolls-Royce fell 6 to 183p, in trade of 2.3m with SG Warburg said to have
had the day's main seller of the stock.
Engineering group Whessoe tumbled 26 to 108p, after the company warned it
would make a loss for the year and would pass the final dividend.
A squeeze was reported in both Hall Engineering and McKechnie. The former
jumped 20 to 195p, while the latter put on 12 to 482p.
News that services group Inchcape has teamed up with Coca-Cola to invest in
six bottling franchises in Russia cheered the market. The shares appreciated
4 to 461p.
Firm platinum prices boosted Lonrho and the shares gained 3 to 132 1/2 p.
Strong demand for airports group BAA ahead of Friday's first quarter figures
saw the shares advance 10 to 994p.
A stock overhang was said to have undermined Taunton Cider, off 7 at 173p.
The strong Confederation of British Industry export figures helped selected
spirits companies. Matthew Clark advanced 9 to 558p and Highland
Distilleries was ahead 8 at 432p.

FT  27 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Billiton sale news hits Shell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News that Shell Transport was poised to conclude the sale of its Billiton
metals business provided a motive to mark down the share price when it was
announced late yesterday.
The announcement that Gencor of South Africa had agreed to buy the most of
Shell's Billiton upstream assets for Dollars 1.14bn after charges contained
no surprises.
However, the shares had driven up by almost 10 per cent since the start of
the month and one oil specialist pointed out that while they normally traded
at a significant yield premium to the market the rising share price had
pushed the yield towards par.
Also, the US oil majors began their reporting season this week and the
figures have tended to match the gloomy forecasts. Yesterday Chevron
reported disappointing figures.
Shell Transport shares ended the day 10 lower at 732p, although the day's
final turnover of 2.5m shares suggested that the bears were merely shadow
boxing.

<TEXT>
The near month Footsie futures contract broke through two resistance levels
after a squeeze sent it sharply ahead in thin trading, writes Joel Kibazo.
The September contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 3,125 and the first hour
was marked by inactivity.
However, a buying order from a US dealer that was given to three UK houses
for execution enlivened an otherwise dull market and brought a mid-morning
squeeze That sharp upward movement saw the contract break through the 3,033
and 3,046 resistance levels to reach the day's high of 3,055.
September relinquished some of the earlier gains in the afternoon as dealers
turned their attention to the weakness in gilts and the poor opening on Wall
Street. The contract held on to a strong premium to cash for most of the
session which encouraged arbitrage trading
It closed at 3,145, at a 26 point premium to cash. Volume at 10,155 lots
remained low.
In traded options, an equipment breakdown left many dealers unable to update
prices for several hours in the first part of the session. Turnover was
19,226 contract, only slightly above the previous total, with 6,502 lots
dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 2,089 in the Euro FT-SE option. Today sees
the expiry of the July series stock options.

FT  27 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: CBI report well received in more
active trade - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The confident trend among manufacturers in the latest Confederation of
British Industry report sent the UK stock market ahead yesterday, although
shares came off the top as British government bonds shied away from the
report's warning about upward pressures on prices. Trading volume was better
than on Monday but still below the level generally considered satisfactory
by the London-based securities houses.
Early trading saw the FT-SE 100 Index gain nearly 27 points to 3,132.8,
encouraged by a strong opening in stock index futures. But this proved to be
the best of the day and shares retreated as the bond market began to react
negatively to the CBI report of potential price inflation.
At the close, the FT-SE gain had been trimmed to 11.1 for a reading of
3,117.2. The market was also restrained by a dull start on Wall Street,
where the Dow Industrial Average shed 10 points in UK hours as the US dollar
gave ground.
Some dollar stocks ended the session lower, among them Shell Transport, a
prominent Footsie stock, as investors took profits following confirmation of
the sale of the Billiton interests to Gencor of South Africa. Traders
maintained that the fall in Shell shares would prove to be short-lived and
that there was nothing in the Billiton deal to unsettle investors.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index held a gain of 17.1 points to 3,641.1 and the
overall tone of the market remained very firm. Traders said that the CBI
report had been very well received, with its disclosure that manufacturing
orders were growing at the highest rate for nearly six years serving to
confirm the stock market perception that economic recovery is showing
through strongly in terms of higher earnings and prospective dividend
payments at British companies.
Seaq volume of 551.7m shares compared with 431.4m on Monday when retail
business returned a total worth of Pounds 1.02bn. World markets are still
relatively quiet, while awaiting the week's sole highlight in the form of
the latest US gross domestic product numbers, due on Friday.
Confidence ahead of the flow of results from the UK financial and banking
sector, which opens today with figures from Lloyds Abbey Life, was
encouraged by the favourable reception from the German stock market for
first half figures from Deutsche Bank.
There were gains in a number of other blue chip shares which are on the
point of disclosing trading results. Reuters and ICI, both with interim
results due this week, closed firmly, and the confident tone of the banking
sector overflowed into the insurance stocks.
Pharmaceuticals also brushed off dollar weakness as several of the sector
leaders continued to stabilise after somne recent uncertainty. Wellcome
remained firm, under the influence of last week's trading statement.
Hopes that the recovery in manufacturing industry will soon spill over into
consumer spending brought some buyers in for the store and retail issues,
which have been marking time as market attention has focused on the
engineering and industrial sectors.
But trading volume in these traditionally active retail issues was fairly
modest and analysts doubted whether investment views towards the sectors had
changed significantly.
Futures markets provided most of the lead for equities and at one time a
premium of more than 20 points against cash was reached on the September
FT-SE futures contract. This premium began to weaken a little in later
trading.
This morning will feature the auction of Pounds 2bn in British government
securities and this could restrain share prices at the opening of today's
session in London.

FT  27 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks affected by poor
results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Blue chip stocks gave ground yesterday after Chevron and Eastman Kodak
released disappointing second-quarter results, writes Frank McGurty in New
York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 6.16 lower at 3,735.68, while the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 0.89 at 453.36.
Activity remained light, with only 231m shares traded on the Big Board.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite inched 0.44 ahead to
434.50, but the Nasdaq composite was 0.66 easier at 715.45.
Stocks failed to break out of their aimless drift amid continued uncertainty
over monetary policy. For the most part, share prices meandered as investors
waited for the Federal Reserve to make good on its chairman's veiled threat
to lift interest rates again in the near future.
Some of the day's economic news was supportive of the view that the Fed
could delay its next credit tightening. The Conference Board, an industry
trade group, said its July index of consumer confidence dipped from the
previous month's reading, suggesting the potential for slower retail sales.
But the data, in line with expectations, had no impact on sentiment, with
economists looking ahead to Friday's preliminary estimate of second-quarter
growth, a report which could prove crucial in the Fed's decision-making.
Bond prices held steady as uncertainty over short-term rates complicated an
afternoon supply auction.
Meanwhile, news from the corporate sector was generally lacklustre. Among
the Dow industrial components, Eastman Kodak revealed a 27 per cent decline
in net earnings from continuing operations and its share price was marked
down Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 48.
Chevron held up a little better, even though its second- quarter profits of
40 cents a share compared poorly with a year-earlier result of 87 cents. The
stock closed down Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 43.
Earnings news in aerospace and defence sectors was mixed. Boeing slipped
Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 45 1/2 . Its results were not as bad as analysts had
forecast, but investors were hardly impressed by its performance. Martin
Marietta dropped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 43 3/8 , while Loral jumped
Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 34 7/8 . A sharp downturn in profits and revenues
at Lincoln National, an Indiana-based insurance company, sent its share
price reeling. The issue dropped nearly 11 per cent, or Dollars 4 5/8 , to
Dollars 38 1/4 in unusually heavy volume of 1.6m shares.
Shares in Jones Apparel lost 21 per cent of their value, with the stock
dropping Dollars 6 3/4 to Dollars 24 3/8 following a downgrading by UBS
Securities.
UAL, parent of United Airlines, tumbled Dollars 4 1/8 to Dollars 99 7/8 in
the wake of the surprise resignation of a union official who was one of the
architects of the recent employee buy-out of the carrier.
On the Nasdaq, Powersoft, a software concern, was hammered amid concern over
its gross margins. The issue tumbled Dollars 7 1/2 to Dollars 43 even though
it matched expectations.
Canada
Toronto share prices fell in light trading, with market attention again
focused on the release of second-quarter financial results. The TSE-300
composite index ended 18.49 points, or 0.44 per cent, lower at 4,149.90.
Declines led advances 423 to 298, volume of 56.13m shares was up from
yesterday's 41.60m. Trading value was CDollars 651.0m compared with CDollars
465.0m.
Two large companies, Northern Telecom and Stelco, both reported
second-quarter net profit compared with a year-earlier loss. Northern
Telecom, whose year-earlier loss included a hefty restructuring charge, rose
CDollars 1 1/8 to CDollars 43 1/4 . Stelco A, however, lost CDollars  3/8 to
CDollars 8 3/8 .
Mexico
Equities rallied to a sharply higher close after investors, relieved by
stronger than expected earnings results, drove the bolsa's IPC index through
two key resistance levels, traders and analysts said.
The IPC finished up 79.46 points at 2,393.40 for a gain of 3.43 per cent.
'Investors were partly responding to earnings reports,' a trader said. Grupo
Carso's results were better than anticipated as were several others.
The buying helped the IPC pierce two resistance levels, at 2,350 points and
at 2,380 points.

FT  27 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Taipei rallies to close
at four-year high
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Demand from corporations and arbitrageurs absorbed small-lot profit-taking
by overseas investors, and prices closed marginally higher in light volume,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 index rose 47.71 to 20,345.37, reversing a 2.3 per cent
decline over the previous three sessions. The index rose to a high of
20,390.88 in the early afternoon, but slipped to a low of 20,241.75 in the
last half hour of trading.
The market focused on worries over profit-taking by foreign investors,
looking to take advantage of the yen's strength. Volume totalled 253m shares
against 223m. Dealers were sidelined on the last day of trading for their
July books.
Some analysts, however, do not expect a mass exodus from Japanese stocks by
overseas investors. 'Some fund managers have decided that Japan will be
quiet for a few months while European and south-east Asian markets have
fallen low enough. But many people are still substantially underweight in
Japan,' said Mr Jason James, strategist at James Capel.
The Topix index of all first section stocks edged up 0.99 to 1,622.78, while
the Nikkei 300 rose 0.20 to 293.96. Advances led declines by 514 to 472,
with 192 issues remaining unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was
down 1.26 at 1,308.41.
High-technology stocks were lower. Toshiba, the most active issue of the
day, lost Y19 to Y735 and Hitachi declined Y17 to Y975. But Fujitsu gained
Y10 to Y1,040 and Oki Electric Industry rose Y4 to Y740.
Automobile makers continued to face selling by overseas investors. Nissan
Motor fell Y5 to Y745 and Toyota Motor declined Y50 to Y2,100.
Arbitrage buying lifted bank stocks. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank gained Y30 to
Y1,780 and Mitsubishi Bank rose Y10 to Y2,590. But brokers declined, with
Nomura Securities down Y10 to Y2,230 and Nikko Securities losing Y10 to
Y1,250.
Nippon Housing Loan, the housing loan company facing mounting bad debts,
declined Y11 to Y230 on reports that it was pulling out of the mortgage
securities business.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 39.88 in volume of 56.2m shares. The index
declined for the fourth consecutive day on position squaring. Nintendo, the
video game maker, fell Y60 to Y6,700.
Roundup
Local stories predominated yesterday.
Nomura has reduced its weighting in Japan from 36 per cent to 28 per cent,
and, within the region, has moved 2 per cent to Korea, and 1 per cent each
to Hong Kong, Malaysia, Australia and Taiwan.
TAIPEI finished at a four-year high led by a rally in financials, chemicals
and foods, while the plastics sector rebounded after lagging behind last
week.
The weighted index added 39.22 or 0.6 per cent to 6,727.22, its highest
level since June 6, 1990. Turnover was firm at TDollars 107.24bn.
Among financials Cathay Life Insurance surged TDollars 14.00 to TDollars
218.00 to gain the daily seven per cent limit before going ex-dividend.
HONG KONG recovered from morning losses to close firmer on late buy orders
triggered by better-than-expected government land auction results.
The Hang Seng index rose 19.74 to finish at 9,194.36 after falling to a low
of 9,117.02 in early trade.
Property issues jumped sharply after the afternoon auction but came off
their highs by the close as investors concluded that the sale of the
relatively small sites was not enough to determine whether the government's
recent campaign to cool the real estate market was effective.
Cheung Kong ended 30 cents higher at HKDollars 35.90, Henderson Land gained
40 cents to HKDollars 38.90 and Sun Hung Kai Properties added 40 cents
HKDollars 47.90.
MANILA fell 1.5 per cent on profit-taking after gaining about 120 points in
two days, and brokers said that prices were likely to consolidate further.
The composite index fell 42.98 to 2,728.53 in volume of 708.9m shares worth
1.21bn pesos.
Davao Union Cement, which was making its debut on the exchange, was actively
traded well above its offer price of 5.60 pesos. Its B shares ended at 6.90
pesos while the A shares closed at 6.00 pesos.
SYDNEY weakened as sentiment was undermined by prospects of tighter monetary
policy, with a central bank board meeting in progress yesterday.
The All Ordinaries index fell 7.0 to 2,041.3, just off its low of 2,039.2.
Turnover was only modest at ADollars 233m.
Banks and insurers were weaker, with only isolated gains.
Elsewhere BHP rose 6 cents to ADollars 18.58, and in the mining sector, CRA
fell 24 cents to ADollars 18.56, with WMC down 15 cents at ADollars 7.30 and
MIM adding 1 cent to ADollars 2.99. Retailers were soft, with Coles Myer
down 3 cents at ADollars 4.22.
SEOUL was lower after broad-based selling but some lightly weighted shares
continued to attract investor interest. The composite stock index gave up
3.92 to 935.20, with the August 12 deadline for investment trust companies
to repay an as yet undecided amount of borrowings to the central bank
continuing to overshadow the market.
Reports that gunfire had been heard on the northern side of the inter-Korean
border on Monday also depressed sentiment, although the defence ministry
said there had been no unusual military activity that would indicate
provocation by North Korea.
KUALA LUMPUR was led higher by speculative buying of second-line stocks
although a lack of foreign buying continued to keep a lid on the market. The
composite index rose 3.93 to 1,008.31.
Golden Plus was among big gainers, rising 55 cents to MDollars 8.40 on
rumour of a business venture in China.
SINGAPORE was mixed after a quiet trading day. The Straits Times Industrials
index ended 6.22 lower at 2,206.04, with the decline largely attributed to
losses in Sembawang and Fraser &amp; Neave .
Sembawang dropped 30 cents to SDollars 10.20 amid speculation that the
performance of its engineering division was likely to drag down the results
of the group.
BANGKOK ended slightly lower in quiet trading as investors awaited today's
no-confidence debate in parliament.
The SET index closed 1.56 lower at 1,346.50 after fluctuating between
1,339.71 and 1,353.39. Turnover was a moderate Bt5.96bn.
Newly listed Rockworth was most active issue, closing at Bt119 on turnover
of Bt422.5m. It opened at Bt102 against a subscriber price of Bt85, before
peaking at Bt124.
BOMBAY edged ahead in a trading session curtailed to one-hour because of a
disruption in the suburban railways. The 30-share BSE index rose 16.13 to
4,122.78.
Some buying was reported in A group shares by the local investors in an
otherwise dull trading session.

FT  27 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Deutsche Bank helps to lift
sentiment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The bourses were livelier yesterday.
FRANKFURT was encouraged by the slightly better than expected results from
Deutsche Bank, which was enough to lift the Dax index by 15.74 to 2,151.96,
but off an intraday high of 2,158.41.
There were further gains in the Ibis, the index rising to 2,163.32
Turnover was DM7.2bn.
Deutsche Bank put on DM7 to DM735.50 ahead of the results which came after
the official session had ended. The bank reported that during the first half
operating profit had risen by 1 per cent: most analysts had been forecasting
a loss.
The bank also said that it expected full year results to be satisfactory. In
Ibis trade the shares rose to DM743.
Among other banking stocks, Commerzbank closed the official session at
DM343, then rose to DM345.50, up DM7.50.
The vehicle sector was strong, Volkswagen for instance up DM3.80 at
DM502.30.
MILAN succumbed to a fresh wave of uncertainty as the latest chapter in the
long running corruption scandal unfolded, and investors worried about
whether the prime minister, Mr Silvio Berlusconi would become embroiled in
the investigations into his Fininvest media empire.
The Comit index registered a 16.62 or 2.3 per cent fall to 709.47 as
investors, lulled by last week's firm performance into expecting a
traditional August rally, sought to lighten their portfolios.
The falls were broadly based although insurers were among the hardest hit
stocks. Generali fell L1,263 or 2.9 per cent to 42,034, Aleanza lost L638 or
3.7 per cent to L16,736 and Ras was L1,147 or 4.2 per cent lower at L26,000.
Telecommunications issues also tumbled. Sip lost L119 to L4,398 and Stet was
L210 lower at L5,296.
Among other blue chips, Fiat gave up L196 or 2.8 per cent to L6,813 and
Olivetti was L89 or 3.5 per cent lower at L2,451.
One of the most resistant stocks was the Fininvest retailer Standa. The
shares were unchanged at L37,000, although volumes were extremely thin.
PARIS retreated from earlier highs to close the CAC-40 index at 2,076.84, a
day's gain of 17.00.
Turnover was FFr4.5bn.
Dealers reported that activity was mainly driven by technical factors.
Eurotunnel moved up more than 5 per cent, the shares putting on FFr1.3 to
FFr26.45 on speculation that it might be brought into the CAC-40 index.
AMSTERDAM rose on interest in cyclicals and the Aex index finished up 1.44
at 404.96.
Among the most impressive performers, Heineken, helped by seasonal factors,
put on Fl 4.20 to Fl 229.60, Akzo Fl 2.30 to Fl 213.50 and KLM Fl 1.10 to Fl
53.60.
Royal Dutch went the other way, off Fl 2.00 at Fl 196.40, as it announced
that it had sold its Billiton metal assets to Gencor of South Africa.
ZURICH failed to find direction and the SMI index gave up early gains to
finish 3.2 higher at 2,604.4.
Banks were firm, UBS adding SFr7 to SFr1,204, amid indications that
investors were switching from chemicals and pharmaceuticals.
Roche certificates lost SFr55 to SFr5,490. Adia, the temporary employment
group, picked up SFr9 to SFr225 following better than expected half year
figures.
BRUSSELS continued to reap the benefits of the budget agreement and the
Bel-20 index added 6.12 to 1,451.92 in turnover of BFr1.2bn.
Solvay gained BFr325 or 2.2 per cent to BFr14,800 helped by a broker's buy
recommendation and speculation over first half results due out today.
Financial stocks were firm.
STOCKHOLM was supported by gains in Astra and Volvo. The Affarsvarlden
general index rose 5.5 to 1,470.5.
Brokers commented that Astra, up SKr2 to SKr169 in the B's, benefited from
reports that a EU advisory panel had decided not to support a German request
to ban the injectable version of the group's anti-ulcer drug Losec.
Turnover was SKr1.7bn.
Volvo, the most active share, added SKr11 to SKr756. Dealers said that the
vehicle group was in heavy demand by international investors.

FT  27 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: Small is beautiful in Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent turbulence in European markets has brought some benefit to at
least one investment sector - Spanish smaller stocks. They have achieved
markedly better performances than shares of larger capitalised companies and
enjoyed a boost in investor interest in a trend that some analysts forecast
will continue.
The James Capel Smaller Spanish index has tended to outperform the Madrid
stock exchange index by 20 per cent, while some stocks have shown
performances of over 30 per cent above the index over the past few months.
As the economy begins to stir there has also been a significant movement
into second line construction and building materials stocks. The shine has
gone off the larger sectors for reasons apart from general market
uncertainty with utilities, one of the major sectors in Madrid, having
fallen off despite many analysts remaining positive on its fundamentals.
Similarly the popularity of banks has slipped, largely in the wake of the
Banesto affair.
Ms Alexandra Perricone, a Spanish analyst with James Capel in London, said
that the fortunes of smaller capitalised stocks were likely to continue,
fuelled by general factors as well as their own potential.
The lack of liquidity generally associated with small stocks has also been
an important influence in squeezing up prices in Spain. Ms Nicola Mann at
Smith New Court points to quite a strong degree of anticipation surrounding
the performance of second line stocks.
'There was a great expectancy that the smaller stocks would outperform the
larger ones and I think that will continue on the grounds of earnings growth
as the reporting season in September moves closer,' she says.
Along with low liquidity, Ms Mann also cites a lack of visibility as a
factor in the swift movement of Spanish smaller stocks.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Pound slips against yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The breach of a key technical level of sterling against yen saw the UK
currency slip on the foreign exchanges yesterday, writes Philip Gawith.
Sterling ignored some good news in the CBI quarterly industrial trends
survey and fell below Y150, a level that had held on previous occasions. It
closed in London at Y149.533 from Monday's Y151.728.
In thin trading conditions, the dollar slipped to close at Y98 from Y98.685,
but was firmer against the D-Mark and finished at DM1.5865 from DM1.576. The
market paid little attention to the Conference board's July consumer
confidence index which slipped to 91.6, from 92.5 in June.
Traders were keeping a close eye on the start of the Whitewater hearings
before the House banking committee.
In Europe, the D-Mark lost ground against most currencies. The Portuguese
escudo responded positively to a rate cut which was seen as a sign of
economic strength. The central bank cut 0.5 of a percentage point off its
rates for draining funds and injecting emergency overnight funds, to 10.5
per cent and 13 per cent respectively. The escudo closed unchanged at
Es102.3 against the D-Mark, its highest level since late April.
In Israel, the central bank said it was raising short term interest rates by
0.5 of a percentage point to a minimum of 11.8 per cent. The move is aimed
at combatting inflation which is expected to rise above the official 8 per
cent target for the year.
A feature of sterling's weakness has been the breakdown of its close
relationship with the dollar. Until recently, statistical studies suggested
that as much as 95 per cent of Dollars /Pounds moves over the past six
months could be attributed to moves in the Dollars /D-Mark rate.
When the dollar made a sharp recovery last week, however, sterling failed to
follow. Mr Robert Thomas, currency strategist at Natwest Markets, commented:
'There was a presumption that the glue that had held sterling to the dollar
as the US currency fell would work the other way too, but it seems to have
weakened.'
Analysts were at a loss to come up with any fundamental factors which might
account for the pound's weakness. The sterling index fell to 78.6, from
79.1, despite the positive news in the CBI survey of manufacturing orders
reaching a six year high.
One possibility suggested was the resurgence of talk recently that Tory
backbenchers, concerned about the government's popularity, might push for
tax cuts this year. This would put pressure on sterling as the UK's fiscal
position currently is not judged to be strong enough to accommodate tax
cuts.
Another possible factor contributing to sterling weakness was a newspaper
report that the European Union might seek to force the UK to comply with the
social chapter of the Maastricht treaty. If Mr Major distances himself from
Europe, this could lead to selling of sterling in the short term.
Part of the explanation for the fairly listless performance of the dollar is
that there is little new information to chew on. 'From the market's point of
view the problem is that we are not likely to see a policy change from the
US or Germany for a number of weeks,' said Mr Tony Norfield, treasury
economist at ABN-AMRO.
The Bundesbank has frozen its repo rate at 4.85 per cent for the next four
weeks, while the Federal Reserve is not expected to shift rates before the
mid-August FOMC meeting.
This did not stop Mr Wayne Angell, economist at Bear Stearns and former Fed
governor, criticising the 4.25 per cent Fed funds rate as too accommodative.
He suggested that as many as seven Fed banks might ask for a discount rate
hike prior to the August FOMC meeting.
There was also good news for the dollar in the form of supportive interest
rate comments emerging from Germany. Mr Hilmar Kopper, chief executive of
Deutsche Bank, told the bank's interim press conference that he expected the
decline in short term interest rates to continue.
His comments followed overnight observations from Mr Otmar Issing, a
Bundesbank board member, who stressed that the 'summer break does not mean
that we have rolled down the blinds and closed down policy. Rather, we have
made clear that what we want is stability in the money markets and to calm
down interest rate expectations,' he said.
German call money firmed to 4.95/5.05 per cent ahead of today's repo where
the rate has been fixed at 4.85 per cent. Ms Alison Cottrell, international
economist at Midland Global Markets, predicts that only a low portion of
bids are likely to be filled.
'With call money at 5 per cent and rising, and the repo rate a fixed 4.85
per cent, banks will bid for more funds than normal,' said Ms Cottrell.
There is no downside risk of paying more, and in the expectation that others
will do likewise, banks are likely to inflate their bids to ensure they get
their share of funds.
The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 450m assistance
after forecasting a Pounds 550m shortage.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesia to cut timber
production by 28%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MANUELA SARAGOSA
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Indonesian government has announced plans to reduce its timber output by
over 28 per cent over the next five years because excessive felling is
believed to have caused floods followed by severe droughts on the country's
most densely populated island of Java.
Mr Djamaloedin Soeryohadikoesoemo, the minister of forestry, said that the
country's timber production would be cut to 22.5m cubic metres by the turn
of the century from its present level of just over 30m cu m.
This month a severe drought in central Java damaged about 16,000 hectares of
rice fields and is expected to lead to 3 per cent fall in Indonesia's rice
output. Excessive logging is destroying the forest's crucial function of
watershed protection.
Plans to reduce timber output are linked to increasing concern about the
extent of illegal logging in the country. The government estimates between
4m and 6m cu m a year are cut down illegally each year but environmental
lobbyists say the figure is much higher.
In recent months, the Ministry of Forestry has attempted to crack down on
illegal logging. Mr Soeryohadikoesoemo said that 248 forest concessionaires
had violated logging regulations and were being fined a total of Dollars
21m. Some concessionaires had already had their logging licences revoked.
Plans are also under way to implement an eco-labelling scheme, which would
provide consumers with information about the origin of wood products
manufactured in Indonesia.
Wood and paper products accounted for nearly a third of the total value of
Indonesia's non-oil exports last year.

FT  27 JUL 94 / World Commodities Prices: Plunge in copper prices undermines
other metals - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sharp falls in COPPER prices weighed on the other base metals contracts at
the London Metal Exchange yesterday afternoon.
Copper's three months delivery price plunged through several important chart
support points, notably at Dollars 2,510 and Dollars 2,495 a tonne, as fund
selling, stop-loss sales and liquidation brushed aside any buying, dealers
said.
The ALUMINIUM market suffered from heavy liquidation, which emerged when the
three months price backed through the Dollars 1,495-Dollars 1,500-a-tonne
area, ignoring news of a further fall in LME warehouse stocks.
At the London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures recovered some of Monday's
big falls as traders waited for Brazil to give a revised official estimate
for the 1995-96 crop following the recent frosts. They said rumours that
Brazil might cancel the auction of an extra 5m bags of stocks gave further
encouragement to speculative buyers.
COCOA prices moved higher with coffee and were also aided by concern about
dry weather in the Ivory Coast.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK bread-wheat faces
continental challenge - Imports have soared as the domestic crop has
stagnated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK wheat farmers risk losing market share to French and German rivals if
they fail to grow enough quality bread-grain to meet millers' needs,
according to leading flour milling and baking group Rank Hovis MacDougall.
With the advent of the single market and ever closer European Union
intra-trade, the UK flour industry will almost certainly be challenged by
continental competitors seeing outlets for their excess mill capacity in the
years ahead. At a time when the EU is under notice to cut wheat exports
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade flour is an assured outlet
that farmers can ill afford to lose.
RHM's plea to farmers is a perennial one, but this year it has taken on a
sharper edge. In the past 12 months, UK bread-wheat imports soared 50 per
cent to an estimated 1.5m tonnes - double the level of 1991-92 - after the
domestic crop failed to supply the normal 80 per cent of millers' needs.
Millers' costs rose as quality wheat also ran short in Canada and the US,
whose hard wheats are used to raise flour quality. It was a big
disappointment for consumers who had been led to believe that wheat prices
would drop 29 per cent with reform of the EU's common agricultural policy.
The millers acknowledge UK farmers face a dilemma. Bread-wheat needs plenty
of sunshine when crops are ripening to create protein and other qualities
essential to make bread rise when baked. So the crop carries a risk of
failure from fickle weather.
Sufficient price premiums are needed to encourage planning of bread-wheat
instead of lower-priced but much higher-yielding (and easier to grow)
feed-wheat.
Plant breeders have been working for years to come up with an optimum mix of
quality and yield to maximise farmers' profits; but such compromises do not
suit millers' needs. Bread-flour requires a consistent and finely-balanced
quality of wheat.
'We need to know exactly what we're getting - varietal integrity, for
example, is all important,' points out Mr Peter Baker, managing director of
Rank Hovis's milling division.
Farmers aiming to grow for the 3.2m-3.4m- tonne UK bread-wheat market have
to rely on guidance from their seed suppliers and on the signal from the
previous season's breadwheat premiums. Some guesswork is inevitable.
Yet getting the right balance between supply and demand is vital - too big a
bread-wheat crop can depress the price premium and put farmers off in the
following year. One suggestion is for more farmers to grow bread-wheat under
fixed contracts with buyers - a system expected to produce several hundred
thousand tonnes next year. But contracts can have drawbacks. A miller could
find himself locked into fixed costs while his competitors benefitted from a
fall in the market value of bread-wheat. Contracts would not prevent farmers
growing too much bread-wheat, happened four years ago, causing the premium
to collapse. Neither would contracts ensure production as the crop could
fail on weather factors. 'None the less, contracts may be a partial answer,'
concedes Rank Hovis Wheat director, Mr Peter Jones.
RHM, like other UK millers, sources its bread-wheats from many origins to
build up quality of the 200 grades of flour it produces. In recent years,
thanks to quantum leaps in crop quality and flour milling technology,
British flour has been made from up to 88 per cent home-grown grain. In the
past year that dropped to only 71 per cent, partly because farmers sowed
insufficient quantities of the right (Class I) varieties, partly because the
weather affected quality and partly because of missed opportunities.
Hundreds of tonnes were drawn in from the Continent where supplies were
often more readily available at competitive prices.
This year's UK wheat plantings are estimated to have risen by about 1.5 per
cent, suggesting, with average yields, a crop close to last year's 12.9m
tonnes. A fortnight ago Mr Jones was hoping that the fine weather would
yield enough bread-wheat to reduce imports to as little as 1m tones. But
weeks of scorching, dry conditions have threatened crop stress and concern
for quality is already reflected in slow farmer selling and premiums of up
to Pounds 24 a tonne for bread-wheat over feed-wheat. A clear national
quality picture will not emerge, however, before the second week of August,
when harvesting will be in full swing.
The bread-wheat premiums must also be added to higher-than-expected base
prices - confounding forecasts that consumers' grain costs would be cut by
CAP reform. Although EU support prices have been reduced in European
currency unit terms sterling prices have been boosted by two 'green' pound
devaluations this month alone. Not that the open market need take much
notice of support - it is already trading well above that level, and above
that of this time last year, thanks to empty intervention stores, a year of
heavier-than-expected exports, and strong demand from the animal feed
sector. Having started the new season with a much smaller carry-over, the UK
has already sold forward a significant chunk of the coming crop for export.
With EU intervention stocks also sharply down and concern being expressed
over French and German wheat quality many consumers are bracing themselves
for high grain costs over the coming year.
'What we need above all is orderly marketing,' says Mr Jones. 'We want to
use more British wheat and we could have used more last year if prices had
been competitive when quality fears first emerged. There is always a
tendency in this market to respond to short-term price signals;
opportunities to sell at a reasonable price can be lost. However, it is
vital for farmers in the long term to keep as much of this processing
business as they can in the UK.'

FT  27 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Platinum price at a 3 1/2 -year
high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Platinum prices were given a boost yesterday when speculators seized on
bullish comments by Mr Michael Steel, market research director of Johnson
Matthey, the world's biggest platinum market group.
He suggested in an interview with a Reuter correspondent in Tokyo that Japan
might import record quantities of platinum and palladium this year and that
the world's platinum supply surplus might disappear in 1995. Both metals are
used in car anti-pollution catalysts.
Some US funds took this as a 'buy' signal and in London platinum's price
raced up to its highest level in three and a half years before closing at
USDollars 421.75 a troy ounce, up Dollars 5 an ounce. Palladium's price was
'fixed' in London at Dollars 151 an ounce, its highest since July, 1989.
Mr Steel said that platinum should be helped by a pick-up in world economic
activity and a steady increase in demand for platinum jewellery. Demand in
Japan, the world's largest consumer of both platinum and palladium, was high
because of jewellery and investment demand even though use by Japan's motor
industry would fall this year, he added.
Some analysts suggested that platinum prices would continue to be supported
by worries about labour unrest in South Africa, the biggest producer, and
also growing doubts about production at Norilsk in Russia, the
second-largest.
However, Mr George Milling-Stanley, analyst at Lehman Brothers, said it was
not a good sign that jewellery and investment demand - rather than the
industrial sector - was helping prices up in Japan. He said: 'This may well
be a flash in the pan for the platinum group metals'.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Jamaica calls time on
international bauxite pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Jamaica is leaving the bauxite producers' organisation, which it helped to
create 20 years ago, suggesting that it is no longer relevant to its
members.
It will tell the other members of the International Bauxite Association that
the body should be dissolved. If the others disagree then Jamaica will
secede, says Mr Robert Pickersgill, the island's mining minister.
The government's decision has come after several months of uncertainty over
the future of the IBA, which has its headquarters in Kingston, following
reports that many members were delinquent in meeting their financial
obligations.
The association, which bauxite (aluminium ore) and alumina (aluminium oxide)
consumers had feared would become a cartel, has been acting as a data bank
for its members, allowing them to exchange information and ideas on the
state of the industry. It received a setback two years ago when Australia,
its most important member, pulled out, questioning the IBA's relevance.
This deprived the IBA of about 40 per cent of its budget, and the situation
was worsened by a high level of delinquency among the remaining members. The
association lists its members as Ghana, Guinea, Guyana, India, Indonesia,
Jamaica, Sierra Leone and Surinam. Before Australia pulled out the IBA lost
two of its founding members - the Dominican Republic and Haiti - because
their industries were shut down. It also lost another founding member with
the break-up of Yugoslavia.
'When the IBA was established in 1974 its members accounted for about 75 per
cent of the world's bauxite production, but this has fallen to about 25 per
cent today,' Mr Pickersgill says. 'We have said to the other members that we
do not think that we are progressing, and that we want an end to the IBA.'
The IBA was unsuccessful in expanding its membership, and failed to attract
producers such as Brazil despite repeated attempts. It also failed to broker
a commodity pact between bauxite producers and consumers under the aegis of
the UN Committee on Trade and Development, because of a lack of support from
either side, and because bauxite trade could not be organised in pacts
similar to those for other commodities.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Government Bonds: Short-dated Treasuries steady despite
auction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Short-dated US Treasury bonds held steady yesterday even though an afternoon
supply auction generated better demand than expected. The long end gave back
some of the previous session's gains.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  5/32 lower
at 85 25/32 , with the yield rising to 7.537 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was  1/32 firmer at 99 13/16 , to yield 6.084 per cent.
In the early hours, uncertainty surrounding the Treasury's sale of Dollars
17.25bn in new two-year securities kept activity across the board to a
minimum. Prospects for a smooth sale were complicated by the threat of an
imminent move by the Federal Reserve to lift interest rates. Traders said
the issue would not prove attractive unless it was awarded with a 6.25 per
cent yield, well above current levels.
In the event, the notes were awarded at 6.17 per cent as the auction drew
reasonable interest from retail buyers. But the sale's success failed to
give the market much of a lift.
The day's economic news had no discernible impact, although it provided
further support for a scenario which sees the Fed delaying its next move to
tighter credit. The Conference Board, an industry group, said its July index
of consumer confidence came in at 91.6, a slight decline from June's level
of 92.5, but analysts were already counting on a dip in the reading.
With the two-year notes out of the way, the market's next hurdle is the sale
of Dollars 11bn in five-year notes this afternoon. The Treasury's quarterly
refunding operation is scheduled for early August.
European government bonds ended yesterday's session slightly weaker, weighed
down by the prospect of new supply in several markets and by the softer tone
in the US.
Once again, most of the activity took place in the futures pits. With many
players away on their summer holiday, futures volume has shrunk
significantly, which means that even fairly small transactions can sometimes
move prices substantially.
Italian bonds posted the sharpest losses of the day, plagued by worries that
the judicial investigation into Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's holding
company Fininvest could trigger another political crisis.
Political jitters triggered a sharp slide in the futures market towards the
close. In after-hours trading on Liffe, the September BTP future was down
about 1.38 points at 102.60.
Further weighing on the market's mood is the prospect of L7,000bn of new
supply late this week and next Monday.
'The total amount sounds relatively small, but there are no bonds maturing,'
so the authorities need to raise new money, said Mr Jouni Kokko,
international economist at SG Warburg Securities.
UK gilts shed nearly half a point, weighed down by the latest CBI report
(showing manufacturing output growing rapidly), selling ahead of today's
gilt auction and weaker continental European markets.
The Bank of England today is due to issue Pounds 2bn of 6.25 per cent gilts
due 2010 - the first time since January that it is issuing a long-dated
conventional stock.
While there was not much evidence of strong retail interest, some traders
said they expected demand from UK funds with long-dated liabilities and some
overseas investors seeking exposure to sterling assets as the currency has
stabilised at a lower level.
German bunds ended slightly weaker on thin volume as traders awaited today's
auction of 6.25 per cent five-year notes for the Treuhandanstalt, Germany's
privatisation agency.
Traders reported scant retail demand for the deal, which is expected to
total around DM4bn - 5bn. The September bund future on Liffe slipped by 0.25
points to 93.69.
French bonds again slightly outperformed Germany as foreign buying
continued, especially in the futures pits. The September notional government
contract on Matif rose by 0.16 points to 117.78.

The subscription period for the new shares, likely to be priced at a small
premium to the Dollars 10.50 issue price of the old shares, will close in
early October. The fund plans to pay its maiden dividend next year.
Existing shareholders will not have pre-emptive rights in respect of the
placing, but they will be rewarded with one free warrant for every five

FT  27 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: Regulators given guidance on
risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Basle committee guidelines on managing risk in derivatives - issued
yesterday to banking supervisors - emphasise that dealers should be guided
by written policy documents laying out how much risk banks' directors will
tolerate.
They say that bank boards should be informed regularly of the risk exposure
of their institution, and re-evaluate their risk management policies
consistently. They say boards must also ensure clear lines of management
responsibility.
Those dealing foreign exchange, derivatives and other traded instruments
should be able to mark their positions to market prices at least daily,
while some bigger institutions should be able to do so in real-time.
The Basle guidelines say banks should emphasise strongly assessments of
credit risk to companies to which they are selling complex and
over-the-counter derivative products such as swaps, which may carry
exposures for several years.
They say the heavy use of computerised systems in the trading of derivatives
means banks must make contingency plans for interruptions to normal
processing. Regular reviews of technical equipment may help reduce risks.
The Basle guidelines say that banks should review the legal structure of the
countries in which they are operating before entering derivatives
transactions, to make sure their customers' obligations can be legally
enforced.
Guidelines issued simultaneously by the technical committee of the
International Organisation of Securities Commissions say evolving technology
permits 'the engineering of increasingly complex financial instruments'.
Iosco says this also allows market participants to unbundle different forms
of risk. The products 'have risk profiles that are more difficult to analyse
than simpler, one-dimensional financial products'.
Iosco's guidelines say there are some differences in perspective with the
Basle guidelines because of traditional differences of supervisory style,
but both banks and securities regulators believe in strong management
controls.
The Iosco guidelines say:
The framework of risk management policies overseen by boards of directors
should specifically cover derivatives activity, establish responsibility for
its implementation and provide for accurate and timely management reporting.
The speed of evolution and complexity of derivatives products means firms
should devote 'adequate resources' to all aspects of risk management
controls, including back office systems, accounting and supervision.
Firms should use risk reduction techniques, such as master agreements,
netting exposures, collateralising transactions and third party credit
enhancement, including letters of credit and guarantees.
Firms should - both on an entity and group basis - be able to make accurate
risk valuations daily and to identify concentrations of risks. Exposures may
be netted providing netting arrangements are enforceable.
Management controls should provide for independent credit risk management at
the firm. This would set measurement standards and credit limits, and review
leverage, concentration and risk reduction measures.

FT  27 JUL 94 / International Bonds: European Community limits issue to
Ecu220m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Community had the eurobond market to itself yesterday for the
launch of its widely-expected Ecu-denominated offering of seven-year bonds,
although the amount raised, Ecu220m, was below expectations of Ecu300m.
Proceeds are expected to be on-lent to countries in eastern Europe and
northern Africa. It is believed that the issue's smaller than expected size
resulted from the failure of one of the loan beneficiaries to complete the
paperwork in time. However, syndicate managers expect the issue to be
increased to Ecu300m later.
An EC official said competition to arrange the deal had been fierce, with 10
houses bidding for the mandate. However, since the EC wanted to take
advantage of strong retail demand, which has been fanned by high redemptions
of Ecu bonds this year and the Ecu's good performance recently, it decided
not to pick the most aggressive bid.
The official said other factors had been taken into consideration, such as
the lead managers' large retail networks in continental Europe and their
commitment to the secondary market in Ecu bonds. 'It was not the time to
experiment with new people,' he said.
As expected, the bonds were priced to yield well below the the French
government's Ecu bonds, at 11 basis points through the interpolated yield
curve. The pricing dulled the bonds' appeal to institutions but the current
coupon of 7 1/4 per cent and the short payment date were clearly designed to
attract retail investors.
According to joint lead manager SBC, Ecu9.5bn worth of bonds have been
redeemed so far this year but there has only been Ecu4bn of new issuance. A
further Ecu5bn is expected to be redeemed by the end of the year.
In addition, the Ecu has been performing well against other European
currencies, reflecting a resurgence in belief among investors that the core
European states will not give up on monetary union and the single currency.
In the past week alone, the yield spread between five-year French government
Ecu notes and five-year Treuhand D-Mark notes has narrowed from 118 basis
points to 102 basis points.
Elsewhere, favourable swap opportunities prompted a flurry of Swiss franc
issues, with BNG raising SFr250m through an offering of four-year bonds and
Sweden launching a SFr150m five-year issue.
Portugal has signed a Dollars 2bn global multi-currency medium-term note
programme. Lehman Brothers acted as global arranger.

Daewoo, South Korea's fourth-largest conglomerate, reported a 28 per cent
increase in sales to Won16,400bn (Dollars 20.4m) for the first half of 1994,
according to preliminary results. The group expressed confidence that it
could achieve its sales target of Won35,500bn for 1994.
Net profits were Won293.5bn - the first time that Daewoo has revealed
first-half earnings for the entire group. Net profits for all of 1993 were
Won464bn.
Daewoo Corporation, the group's trading and construction unit, reported a 25
per cent rise in net profits to Won30bn as sales grew by 19 per cent to
Won5,100bn. Daewoo Heavy Industries, a machinery producer, had a sharp rise
in profits to Won20bn from Won3bn in the first half of 1993 as sales rose by
35 per cent to Won500bn, reflecting growing exports of excavators and
machine tools.
Daewoo Motor reported a 56 per cent increase in sales to Won1,450bn, the
biggest rise in turnover among the group's main companies. The car company
broke even after suffering a Won85bn loss in 1993.
The improved performance of the car division was due to the introduction of
two models and lower production costs.
Daewoo Shipbuilding, which will merge with Daewoo Heavy Industries in
October, had the largest group profits at Won130bn, an increase of 40 per
cent. Sales grew by 45 per cent to Won1,100bn. The rise in profits reflected
the increased production of high value-added ships and absence of labour
disputes.
Daewoo Telecom profits doubled to Won4bn, although sales fell 6 per cent to
Won220bn.

Coles Myer, one of Australia's largest retailers, and Rank Commercial, the
New Zealand-based company owned by Mr Graeme Hart, yesterday withdrew from
their ADollars 501m (USDollars 372m) takeover assault on Foodland
Associated, the Western Australian grocery business.
Had the offer, to be made by a subsidiary of Rank and funded by borrowed
money, gone ahead, Rank planned to sell on Foodland's Australian assets to
Coles for around ADollars 250m. Foodland's New Zealand interests would have
been sold on to Whitcoulls, a stationery and book retailer.
The decision to ditch the bid came after the Australian Federal Court
yesterday dismissed the two companies' appeal against a temporary injunction
which prevented Coles/Rank from pursuing the offer until at least
mid-September.
This had been successfully obtained by the Trade Practices Commission,
Australia's competition watchdog.

FT  27 JUL 94 / International Company News: JCI posts unexpected rise in
gold revenues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Johannesburg Consolidated Investments, the South African mining house due to
be spun off to black investors, has reported an unexpectedly good increase
of 4.9 per cent in its gold revenue for the June quarter to R539.1m (Dollars
146m) from R513.9m in the previous three months.
Although overall production declined 3.8 per cent to 2.55m tonnes from 2.67m
tonnes, due to extra election-related public holidays, a higher gold price
received and an improved average yield to 4.89 grammes per tonne from 4.76
grammes per tonne helped boost results.
At the group's Western Areas mine, the steel drum shaft failure that
affected the previous quarter's production was repaired at a cost of R11.5m
and net profit after tax improved to R43.16m from R23.48m. H. J. Joel also
showed a significant improvement, converting an operating loss of R0.8m in
the March quarter to a R1m operating profit due to higher gold production at
849kg, up from 828kg.
Improved cost containment at Randfontein estates, however, was unable to
offset lower throughput on the mine as gold production dropped 9.9 per cent
to 7,562kg from 8,392kg. Operating profit decreased 3.6 per cent to R114.7m
from R119m.
Development at JCI's South Deep project also progressed, and exploration
expenditure for the first six months of the year amounted to R29.5m, up from
R12.2m last year.
JCI said plans were well advanced to combine the mining interests at Western
Areas with its South Deep mine, creating a giant new mine with large gold
reserves.
Under the plan, South Deep would provide funding to allow Western Areas to
mine the ore and return to profit. This would allow South Deep to make use
of Western Areas' skills and equipment while capital expenditure at the
former could be used to write off some of the other's profit, improving its
tax position.

FT  27 JUL 94 / International Company News: Gencor steps boldly into world
arena - The Shell package puts the S African group in the top league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With one big, Dollars 1.1bn step, Gencor is to make up for the many years
when its development as an international mining group was held back by South
Africa's political isolation. While its rivals expanded - particularly via
the mining booms in Australia and the Pacific Rim countries - Gencor had to
confine its traditional mining skills to its native country.
Now, after its deal to buy most of the Royal Dutch/Shell mining and minerals
assets operating under the Billiton banner, Gencor will, if all goes well,
by the end of this century control the western world's biggest ferro-nickel
business; the second-largest platinum and mineral sands companies; and be
among the top three gold producers and the top five aluminium groups. It
will also rank among the top 10 in stainless steel and coal and nickel
production.
However, getting to this position has involved a transaction of immense
complexity, and one that has taken well over a year to put together.
The struggle was worthwhile, according to Mr Brian Gilbertson, Gencor
chairman, who said yesterday: 'If we are to rejoin the first league of
mining we simply have to operate globally.'
Once the deal with Shell is completed, Gencor will be one of the most
diversified international resource groups, with income derived mainly from
seven world-class commodity businesses: gold (Gengold); platinum (Impala);
coal (Transnatal); ferro-alloys (Samancor); titanium mineral sands (Richards
Bay Minerals); alumina and aluminium and nickel.
The Billiton operations, located in 15 countries, fit well with those of
Gencor, particularly since the South African group has been 'unbundling' its
assets to concentrate on mining businesses.
Billiton's bauxite and alumina operations in Australia and Brazil can
provide essential raw materials for Alusaf, the South African aluminium
producer in which Gencor has a 41 per cent interest, and which is completing
a Dollars 2bn expansion to increase annual capacity to 646,000 tonnes. South
Africa has no bauxite reserves, and Alusaf has already agreed to take
400,000 tonnes of Billiton's annual alumina output - and maybe more later.
Billiton's Cerro Matoso mine in Columbia produces ferro-nickel well-suited
to the Columbus stainless steel plant in South Africa, in which Gencor has a
33 per cent interest. This will enable the group to export the higher-value
nickel it mines in South Africa, which is really of too high a quality to go
into stainless production.
These - bauxite and alumina in Australia and Brazil and Cerro Matoso - were
the 'core' assets Gencor simply had to have for the deal to be worthwhile.
The other core asset was Billiton's international marketing and trading
organisation, which can provide outlets for the wide range of metals and
minerals Gencor produces.
Fashioning a deal to acquire them was complex and time-consuming, partly
because Billiton did not exist as a separate corporate entity with its own
consolidated financial history. The assets had to be disentangled from Shell
operations around the world - to be placed in a new holding company,
Billiton International - in a way that would give tax advantages to both
Shell and Gencor.
This absence of a Billiton corporation also affected the financing, because
there was no 'clean' package to offer the banks. Neither could Gencor move
cash out of South Africa because of exchange controls. Nevertheless, Gencor
has permission to include its 50 per cent share of Richards Bay Minerals as
part of its contribution to the deal. The Dollars 335m in cash Gencor is
contributing will come from the sale of its North Sea oil assets and its
shareholding in TransAtlantic Holdings.
Consequently, although Gencor has been able to get non-recourse finance, it
is paying well above the usual rate for Billiton's borrowings. It aims to
refinance this part of its debt on more conventional terms as soon as
possible. Billiton's effective funding cost is a modest average 5.2 per
cent, thanks to Shell's contribution to the financing. Shell is taking
Dollars 300m of bonds exchangeable into Billiton equity. The bonds, which
are interest-free for the first free years, can be converted into 29.5 per
cent of Billiton's equity in the first year, and a reduced percentage
thereafter.
Some 61 per cent of Billiton's revenues come from the bauxite and alumina
interests. Indeed, when the aluminium market fully recovers from the worst
recession in its history, aluminium could conceivably contribute most of
Gencor's earnings. If that time comes, Gencor might attempt to balance
earnings by floating Billiton or part of the aluminium assets. Mr Gilbertson
pointed out that a combination of Alusaf and the Billiton up-stream
operations would produce the fifth-largest integrated aluminium business in
the world.
He added: 'At low (aluminium) prices, the deal has little appeal. At high
prices, the returns are huge. If our estimate of the medium-term price
trends are anywhere near correct, then this parcel of assets will prove to
be very valuable, and the price we have paid (Dollars 420m in assets plus
Dollars 335m cash for at least 70.5 per cent of a group with assets worth
Dollars 1.2bn) to have been cheap.'

FT  27 JUL 94 / International Company News: Earnings at Bear Stearns tumble
74%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bear Stearns followed other big Wall Street firms yesterday with a large
drop in quarterly earnings, blamed on sharply lower trading and investment
banking revenues.
The securities firm said net income in its fiscal fourth quarter, which
ended on June 30, fell to Dollars 32.4m from Dollars 124.8m a year ago, a
drop of 74 per cent. Revenues, net of interest expense, fell 37 per cent
over the 12 months, to Dollars 429.9m.
The weak final quarter, however, was not enough to stop the firm posting
record profits of Dollars 387m, against Dollars 362.4m, for its fiscal year,
and a record pre-tax return on equity of 38.7 per cent.
The record results were achieved because earnings were so strong in the
first two quarters.
The problems encountered by Bear Stearns in the latest quarter have
afflicted the entire US securities industry. Demand from companies for
underwriting services, and from investors for broking services, fell
precipitously this year in the wake of sharply higher US interest rates.
The rise in rates has also created a turbulent environment for trading in
financial markets, and many firms' trading profits have fallen as a result.
Bear Stearns, like many others, has been especially hard-hit by turmoil in
the mortgage-backed securities markets.

FT  27 JUL 94 / International Company News: Northern Telecom shows
improvement

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Northern Telecom's share price jumped yesterday after the Canadian
telecommunications equipment maker's second-quarter earnings raised hopes
that its problems of the past few years might be receding.
Net earnings were USDollars 37m, or 15 cents a share, compared with a
Dollars 1.03bn loss, equal to Dollars 4.13 a share, a year earlier.
Last year's results included one-time restructuring and other charges of
Dollars 940m. Revenues rose by 14 per cent to Dollars 2.12bn.
Northern's shares gained Dollars  3/4 to close at Dollars 31 1/4 on the New
York stock exchange yesterday.
Mr Lap Lee, an analyst at Gordon Capital in New York, described Northern as
staging a turnround. 'Slowly but surely, they're coming back,' he said.
The Toronto-based company has been bedevilled in recent years by a variety
of setbacks, including fierce competition, delays in new product development
and management upheavals.
Mr Jean Monty, chief executive, expressed satisfaction with the results in
'this year of transition'. He said Northern's financial condition had been
improved by cost-cutting and the sale of several businesses.
The trend towards improved year-on-year earnings will continue in the second
half, Mr Monty predicted.
The recent improvement is due largely to stronger demand for central office
switches, especially in the US, partially offset by a sharp fall in orders
from Canadian phone companies.
Revenues also picked up in the Far East and Latin America, while multimedia
communications systems enjoyed a double-digit sales increase.
Northern has put a high proportion of recent investments into international
marketing and new products. The latter include a portfolio of wireless phone
equipment, in which Northern had lagged behind its rivals.

Eastman Kodak, the US photographic products group, continued to suffer from
strongly rising costs and weak revenue growth in the second quarter,
resulting in profits below those expected by most analysts.
The company, in the middle of a shake-up aimed at focusing resources on its
imaging business, was also held back by the weak dollar and one-off costs,
including a write-down of some inventory.
'We have said before that 1994 would be a challenging year,' said Mr George
Fisher, the company's recently appointed chairman and chief executive.
The latest quarter's figures had also been harmed by 'a continued softness
in demand in our office imaging business,' he added.
Since Mr Fisher took charge Kodak has announced plans to sell its
non-imaging businesses, including Sterling Winthrop, the drugs company.
Selling the health businesses is not expected to lead the company to report
a book loss, Mr Fisher said.
Costs during the latest three months rose by 6 per cent, to Dollars 3bn,
while revenues edged up only 2 per cent, to Dollars 3.5bn. Kodak also
announced after-tax charges of Dollars 30m for write-downs of some inventory
and servicing agreements. It refused to give further details of the charges.
After-tax earnings for the period, at Dollars 264m, or 79 cents a share,
were down from Dollars 371m, or Dollars 1.13, a year ago.
The decline also reflects the falling US dollar. Currency differences
accounted for a Dollars 57m decrease in net earnings compared with the year
before, and Dollars 107m in the first half as a whole.
The company said this was partly the result of the ending of beneficial
currency hedges which had boosted profits last year. It declined to give
details of its hedging strategy, or the other factors that contributed to
the negative currency effect.
For the first half of the year, net income fell to Dollars 346m, from
Dollars 520m (before accounting changes) in the first six months of 1993.

FT  27 JUL 94 / International Company News: Chevron disappoints as margins
slip in quarter

<TEXT>
Chevron, the San Francisco-based energy group, turned in worse-than-expected
results for the second quarter as profit margins at its refining and
marketing operations slipped further than those of other big US energy
companies.
Like others, Chevron's downstream earnings were hit by the rising oil price,
which pushed up the cost of supplies.
Mr Ken Derr, chairman and chief executive, said US profit margins in
particular had suffered, with a rise in the oil price of around Dollars 3 a
barrel from a year before and an increase in prices of re-fined products of
only Dollars 1 a barrel.
US downstream operations recorded a loss of Dollars 42m, against a profit of
Dollars 97m (before restructuring charges), while the non-US refining and
marketing business saw profits fall to Dollars 27m from Dollars 107m.
Upstream earnings of Dollars 152m were higher than the first three months of
the year but failed to match the year-ago quarter's Dollars 207m.
Overall, after-tax profits in the period were Dollars 257m (after a Dollars
5m charge,) against Dollars 50m (after special charges of Dollars 515m) the
year before.
Earnings per share were 39 cents, up from 8 cents a year ago (or 87 cents
before charges). For the first six months, net income was Dollars 645m
(after charges of Dollars 41m), compared with Dollars 551m (after charges of
Dollars 517m).

deal

<TEXT>
Pilots at USAir, the sixth-largest carrier in the US, have offered to make
Dollars 750m in payroll concessions over five years in exchange for an
equity position in the airline.
The proposal, submitted by the Air Lines Pilots Association, was a response
to USAir's call for Dollars 1bn in overall cost reductions by 1997.
The initial reaction by USAir, in which British Airways has a 22 per cent
stake, was positive. The airline said it was 'pleased' the pilots
'recognised the need to move forward and was looking forward to discussions'
over the union's ideas.
Further talks between the two sides had not been scheduled, however.
The development comes just two weeks after shareholders of UAL, parent of
United Airlines, approved a plan giving its employees a 55 per cent stake in
the carrier in exchange for pay cuts and changes in work rules.
The offer by USAir's pilots envisages a 'restructuring' of the carrier's
financial obligations, and a 'substantial' influx of fresh capital.
In return for average annual pay reductions of Dollars 150m, the pilots are
seeking 'substantial investment returns through equity, preferred stock and
profit sharing'. The union said it would complete the details of its
proposal this week, and present them 'shortly'.

FT  27 JUL 94 / International Company News: Placer Pacific figures improve
before tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Placer Pacific, the Sydney-based mining group which is controlled by
Canada's Placer Dome but quoted separately on the Australian stock exchange,
yesterday reported after-tax profits of ADollars 41.3m (USDollars 30.8m) in
the six months to end-June, down from ADollars 50.4m a year ago.
The company said, however, that the 1993 figures had been boosted by tax
adjustments, totalling ADollars 33.7m.
At pre-tax level, and before outside equity interests in earnings, Placer
Pacific's operating profits rose to ADollars 72.9m, compared with ADollars
37.4m in the previous year.
The company said higher gold production and sales, and lower operating costs
and depreciation charges explained the improvement.
The average price received per ounce of gold was ADollars 544 in the
six-month period, ADollars 38 higher than in the first six months of
1993-94.
Placer, operator of the large Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea, also
revealed that estimated reserves there have been increased to 9.4m ounces of
gold, from 8.5m previously.
It said the upgrading of the reserves was due 'mainly to the increase in the
resource reported in the May 1993 update and additional underground reserves
in the West Zone stopes'.
Placer Pacific holds a 25 per cent stake in the mine, with Highlands Gold
(which is controlled by Queensland's MIM), Renison Goldfields and the PNG
government having similar one-quarter interests.

Stearns

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bear Stearns followed other big Wall Street firms yesterday with a large
drop in quarterly earnings, blamed on sharply lower trading and investment
banking revenues.
The securities firm said net income in its fiscal fourth quarter, which
ended on June 30, fell to Dollars 32.4m from Dollars 124.8m a year ago, a
drop of 74 per cent. Revenues, net of interest expense, fell 37 per cent
over the 12 months, to Dollars 429.9m.
The weak final quarter, however, was not enough to stop the firm posting
record profits of Dollars 387m, against Dollars 362.4m, for its fiscal year,
and a record pre-tax return on equity of 38.7 per cent.
The record results were achieved because earnings were so strong in the
first two quarters.
The problems encountered by Bear Stearns in the latest quarter have
afflicted the entire US securities industry. Demand from companies for
underwriting services, and from investors for broking services, fell
precipitously this year in the wake of sharply higher US interest rates.
The rise in rates has also created a turbulent environment for trading in
financial markets, and many firms' trading profits have fallen as a result.
Bear Stearns, like many others, has been especially hard-hit by turmoil in
the mortgage-backed securities markets.
Its biggest decline in the latest quarter was in its principal transactions
business - where the firm trades its own money - which recorded a 66 per
cent drop in revenues to Dollars 127.7m.
Investment banking revenues fell 31 per cent to Dollars 94m, but revenues
from commissions, boosted by increased clearance, futures and institutional
activity, climbed slightly to Dollars 124.3m.

FT  27 JUL 94 / International Company News: Disposals and mergers boost AECI
at halfway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
AECI, the South African chemicals producer, shrugged off politically-related
labour disruption to record a rise in attributable profit, to R107m (Dollars
28.9m), for the six months to June. This compares with R75m for the same
period last year.
Although turnover dropped to R2.48bn from R2.78bn, net profit before
abnormal items rose to R82m from R61m. However, the year-on-year figures are
not directly comparable because of transactions during the reporting period
which changed the structure of the company.
These included the disposal of 51 per cent of the group's explosives
business to ICI, and the purchase of 50 per cent of Afex Holdings. In
addition, AECI merged its chlor-alkali, plastics and other downstream
operations with the ethylene, propylene and polypropylene operations of
fellow South African chemical producer Sasol. AECI retains a 40 per cent
stake in the new venture, called Polifin.
The transactions reduced turnover. However, investment income surged to R32m
from a loss of R7m last time, largely because the Afex acquisition was
equity-accounted. A R324m surplus on the ICI deal was included as an
abnormal item. Tax paid dropped to R27m from R39m, but a R4m charge for the
5 per cent one-off transitional levy imposed on all South African companies
in the June budget was also included as an abnormal item.

Coles Myer, one of Australia's largest retailers, and Rank Commercial, the
New Zealand-based company owned by Mr Graeme Hart, yesterday withdrew from
their ADollars 501m (USDollars 372m) takeover assault on Foodland
Associated, the Western Australian grocery business.
Had the offer, to be made by a subsidiary of Rank and funded by borrowed
money, gone ahead, Rank planned to sell on Foodland's Australian assets to
Coles for around ADollars 250m. Foodland's New Zealand interests would have
been sold on to Whitcoulls, a stationery and book retailer.
The decision to ditch the bid came after the Australian Federal Court
yesterday dismissed the two companies' appeal against a temporary injunction
which prevented Coles/Rank from pursuing the offer until mid-September at
the very earliest.
This had been successfully obtained by the Trade Practices Commission,
Australia's competition watchdog, after it expressed concerns at the
potential hold which Coles could obtain over the Western Australian grocery
market, and at the lessening of competition generally in the food and liquor
retailing sectors.
The Federal Court decision was warmly welcomed by Professor Allan Fels,
chairman of the TPC. He declared it to be 'a win for consumers and
competition policy in the grocery industry'.
'The Australian grocery industry is extremely volatile at the moment,' he
added. 'The Commission expects it will continue to be involved to ensure
that competition is maintained and the consumer protected.'
The Rank/Coles withdrawal leaves Rank holding a 14.9 per cent in Foodland.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Northern Telecom's share price jumped yesterday after the Canadian
telecommunications equipment maker's second-quarter earnings raised hopes
that its problems of the past few years might be receding.
Net earnings were USDollars 37m, or 15 cents a share, compared with a
Dollars 1.03bn loss, equal to Dollars 4.13 a share, a year earlier.
Last year's results included one-time restructuring and other charges of
Dollars 940m. Revenues rose by 14 per cent to Dollars 2.12bn.
Northern's shares gained 88 cents to Dollars 31.38 on the New York stock
exchange in early trading yesterday.
Mr Lap Lee, an analyst at Gordon Capital in New York, described Northern as
staging a turnround. 'Slowly but surely, they're coming back,' he said.
The Toronto-based company has been bedevilled in recent years by a variety
of setbacks, including fierce competition, delays in new product development
and management upheavals.
Mr Jean Monty, chief executive, expressed satisfaction with the results in
'this year of transition'. He said Northern's financial condition had been
improved by cost-cutting and the sale of several businesses.
The trend towards improved year-on-year earnings will continue in the second
half, Mr Monty predicted.
The recent improvement is due largely to stronger demand for central office
switches, especially in the US, partially offset by a sharp fall in orders
from Canadian phone companies.
Revenues also picked up in the Far East and Latin America, while multimedia
communications systems enjoyed a double-digit sales increase.
Northern has put a high proportion of recent investments into international
marketing and new products. The latter include a portfolio of wireless phone
equipment, in which Northern had lagged behind its rivals.

Net profits at American Express fell 14 per cent in the second quarter of
1994. It blamed lower profits at Lehman Brothers, the investment bank spun
off during the period. Excluding Lehman, the financial services group's
earnings would have risen 19 per cent to Dollars 359m, on the back of higher
spending on charge cards and other products.
Lehman, which last week revealed its second-quarter results had suffered
from poor trading conditions in financial markets, was accounted for as a
discontinued item.
American Express reported net income of Dollars 357m, or 69 cents a share,
on revenues of Dollars 3.5bn, compared with Dollars 416m, or 83 cents, on
revenues of Dollars 3.3bn a year before.
The growth in earnings from continuing operations was driven by a 12 per
cent rise in spending billed to the company's cards to Dollars 34.6bn. The
total number of cards was 5 per cent higher than a year before.
Card fees fell slightly to Dollars 431m, reflecting competition between
issuers, but revenues from fees charged to merchants, which have been under
pressure in recent periods, rose 9 per cent to Dollars 983m.
American Express also reported continued profit growth at its IDS Financial
Services subsidiary, up 21 per cent to Dollars 109m.
For the first six months, net income was Dollars 710m against Dollars 659m
the year before.

FT  27 JUL 94 / International Company News: Jump at Case helps Tenneco climb
67%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tenneco, the diversified US industrial group, recorded a 67 per cent rise in
net income in the second quarter. The improvement follows stronger operating
earnings from most of its businesses, especially the Case farm machinery
business.
Mr Dana Mead, chairman and chief executive, predicted 'stronger operating
results overall' in the second half of the year. The strength of the US
economy and a recovery in Europe, as well as Tenneco's own
quality-improvement programme supported this outlook, he said.
Case, 29 per cent of whose shares were floated recently, recorded a jump in
operating income to Dollars 111m, from Dollars 54m the year before, on
revenues up 4 per cent to Dollars 1.1bn.
The company attributed this advance largely to demand from dealers
replenishing their inventories, especially in North America, where
production was up 20 per cent.
Among other divisions, the biggest profit increases came in packaging, up 47
per cent to Dollars 44m; natural gas, which recorded a rise of 17 per cent
to Dollars 89m; and automotive parts, up 11 per cent to Dollars 82m (before
a one-off charge of Dollars 5m).
The company's packaging operations were helped by the industry-wide
increases in containerboard pricing. In addition, Tenneco said it was
operating at full capacity in plastic-container products, and was installing
new equipment to expand its production by 10 per cent by the end of the year
in this area.
The natural gas business benefited from a new rate structure, which the
company said would even out highs and lows throughout the year. The
automotive business, meanwhile, advanced on high new car production in North
America.

in US sales

<TEXT>
RJR Nabisco, the US tobacco and foods group, shrugged off an 11 per cent
decline in domestic cigarette sales to post a 35 per cent increase in
second-quarter profits to Dollars 192m, before extraordinary items.
After accounting for a Dollars 146m one-off charge related to the repurchase
and retirement of debt, RJR's net income in the quarter totalled Dollars
46m. In the same quarter a year ago, after a Dollars 65m charge for debt
repurchase and retirement, the group earned net income of Dollars 77m.
Excluding extraordinary items, RJR's first-half profits rose to Dollars
386m, up from a comparable Dollars 352m a year earlier.
The company said improved domestic tobacco margins, rising international
cigarette sales, and a strong performance from its worldwide food businesses
were behind the advance during the quarter.
It was the first reporting period not affected by last year's so-called
Marlboro Friday, when Philip Morris prompted a price war among cigarette
makers by cutting the price of its premium brands.
Operating income during the three months was Dollars 675m on sales of
Dollars 3.78bn, up from Dollars 582m a year earlier on sales of Dollars
3.72bn. Amid continued aggressive expansion overseas, most notably in former
Soviet bloc countries, RJR's international tobacco business again performed
strongly. However, foreign exchange losses - said by analysts to total
Dollars 28m - took their toll.
The group's Nabisco foods business reported a 20 per cent increase in
operating earnings, with domestic biscuit sales again posting impressive
growth.
RJR's results were in line with analysts' forecasts, but their failure to
match the better-than-expected second-quarter earnings of rivals Philip
Morris and American Brands disappointed some investors, who bid the group's
stock down Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 6 1/8 in New York.

term

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Boeing, the Seattle-based aerospace group, suffered a near 50 per cent fall
in second-quarter net earnings, as aircraft deliveries fell sharply.
Mr Frank Shrontz, chairman and chief executive, affirmed earlier forecasts
of 260 deliveries for the full year, with production showing a 20 per cent
decline in the second half, compared with the first. Revenues for the year
are estimated at Dollars 21bn, about the same as the previous year.
In the three months to the end of June, the world's largest aircraft
manufacturer turned in a net profit of Dollars 222m, or 65 cents a share, on
revenues of Dollars 5.4bn.
The results compare with earnings of Dollars 426m, or Dollars 1.25, and
sales of Dollars 8bn in the second quarter of last year.
Although the decline was severe, Boeing's performance was better than Wall
Street had expected. Profits were well ahead of a consensus forecast which
projected net earnings at 56 cents a share.
Analysts said Boeing limited the damage to the bottom line by lowering its
effective federal tax rate to 26 per cent, from 31.7 per cent in 1993. Its
burden was eased by a tax credit for research and development costs and
tax-exempt income benefits associated with export sales.
In spite of the surprise, Boeing's stock slipped Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 45
1/8 on Wall Street. 'It was a non-operational gain, and the market usually
doesn't give you much credit for them,' said Mr Jack Modzelewski, an analyst
at PaineWebber, the New York securities house.
Mr Wolfgang Demisch, of BT Securities in New York, said he expected analysts
to add about 10 cents to their full-year forecast in view of the reduced tax
rate. Currently, Wall Street projects 1994 profits at Dollars 2 a share,
down from Dollars 3.66 last year.
At an operating level, the results were in line with expectations. A
two-year slump in commercial aircraft production showed no sign of abating,
with 67 deliveries reported in the second quarter, compared with 109 in the
year-earlier period.
Lower corporate investment income and higher interest expense had a negative
impact on profits.
Research and develop-ment costs are expected to exceed 1993 expenditures of
Dollars 1.7bn. The increase partly reflects extensive testing and systems
integration of the new 777 commercial airliner, which is scheduled to begin
passenger service next May.
For the first half, the company posted net earnings of Dollars 514m, or
Dollars 1.51 a share, against profits of Dollars 751m, or Dollars 2.21, in
the 1993 period.
Sales declined to Dollars 11.7bn from Dollars 14.6bn.

FT  27 JUL 94 / International Company News: Digital shares advance in spite
of mounting losses

Digital Equipment yesterday reported heavy fourth-quarter and year-end
losses as the computer manufacturer continued to struggle to achieve a
turnround after four years of losses.
Net losses for the quarter were Dollars 1.75bn, or Dollars 12.64 a share,
after restructuring charges of Dollars 1.2bn and write-offs of intangible
assets valued at Dollars 380m. Losses from operations were Dollars 160m, or
Dollars 1.22 per common share, which were above Wall Street projections.
Revenues for the quarter were Dollars 3.92bn.
In the fourth quarter last year Digital recorded net earnings of Dollars
113.2m, or 85 cents, on revenues of Dollars 3.91bn
In spite of the heavy losses, its shares rallied to close at Dollars 19 3/4
, up from Monday's close of Dollars 18 3/4 . Analysts were encouraged by
higher-than-expected revenues. Orders booked during the quarter increased.
'The fundamentals of our business are showing some positive and encouraging
signs,' said Mr Robert Palmer, president and chief execu-tive.
However, product gross margin fell sharply to 25 per cent of sales, from
38.7 per cent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1993.
The drop reflected a shift toward lower-margin personal computers. PC sales
almost doubled in the quarter and represented 39 per cent of Digital's
computer revenues, the company said.
Other factors reducing product profit margins included price reductions, a
shift toward increased use of indirect sales channels via independent
resellers and plant closure costs.
Sales of Digital's Alpha systems, based on the company's new high
performance microprocessor technology, were up 54 per cent from the third
quarter and 164 per cent year-over-year.
Alpha systems represent 31 per cent of computer revenues.
During the fourth quarter Digital cut 9,200 jobs, said Mr Vincent Mullarkey,
chief financial officer. Digital was confident it could fund restructuring
activities from operations and asset sales, he said.
For the fiscal year, Digital suffered a net loss of Dollars 2.2bn, or
Dollars 15.80 a share. In addition to the fourth-quarter charges, the
year-end figure included a charge for accounting changes of Dollars 51m.
Net loss on operations for the year was Dollars 519m, or Dollars 3.86.
Revenues declined by 6 per cent to Dollars 13.45bn from Dollars 14.37bn in
fiscal 1993 when the company reported net losses of Dollars 251m, or Dollars
1.93.

FT  27 JUL 94 / International Company News: BCP launches largest Portuguese
bid
</HEADLINE>

   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banco Comercial Portugues yesterday announced a Es132bn (Dollars 781m)
public offer for a controlling stake of 40 per cent of Banco Portugues do
Atlantico. The purchase would push BCP to first position, from fourth, in
the ranking of Portugal's commercial banks.
BCP's offer, the biggest take-over bid in Portugal, is the first of what is
expected to be a number of important acquisition and merger attempts as the
five biggest banks, several of them recently privatised, jostle for market
share.
BCP's bid, at Es3,000 a share, values BPA, Portugal's largest commercial
bank, at Es300bn. The offer is almost 50 per cent higher than BPA's market
price and about 16 times forecast 1995 earnings.
BPA shares closed at Es2,010 yesterday, down from Es2,022 on Monday. Dealers
said the offer was announced too late to make a large impact on prices. BCP
shares closed at Es2,231, down from Es2,235 the previous day.
Lisbon stock market analysts considered the offer high. BCP officials
acknowledged the bank was prepared to pay a premium for winning control of
BPA and to improve the group's market position.
Mr Jorge Jardim Goncalves, BCP chairman, said the offer was made to expand
BCP's market share and increase its potential for cross-selling financial
products, because growth based on the bank's existing resources was proving
too slow.
He said control of BPA would increase BCP's market share to 22 per cent,
from about 10 per cent, after the disposal of some companies within the BPA
group that would be superfluous to the new group. He said BPA's brand name
and marketing strategy would not be altered.
BCP, based on results for 1993, is Portugal's fourth largest commercial bank
by net assets but it ranks first in terms of own capital. An earlier attempt
to expand was frustrated last year when the government turned down BCP's
offer to purchase state-owned Banco Pinto &amp; Sotto Mayor, Portugal's sixth
ranked commercial bank.
BCP's offer has to be approved by the stock exchange commission, the finance
ministry and the central bank.
If approved, the operation is not expected to be completed before November.

FT  27 JUL 94 / International Company News: Strong first half at Banco
Santander
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banco Santander, the Spanish banking group which last April paid just over
Dollars 2bn to acquire Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), posted strong
first-half results yesterday to secure it as Spain's leading bank.
Santander raised its consolidated net profits by 8.2 per cent to Pta51bn
(Dollars 389m) in spite of what Mr Emilio Botn, the chairman, termed 'a
difficult economic environment characterised by limited credit demand, a
high level of competition and the negative impact of the sharp drop in the
stock and bond markets'.
The first-half results, which are likely to form the highwater mark for the
Spanish banks at the half-year stage, compared with a 14 per cent
consolidated net profit fall by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, BBV, which rivals
Santander in size, and a net income increase of just 1.2 per cent by the
smaller Banco Popular group which has the reputation of being the most
profitable domestic banking group.
In common with the rest of the banking sector, Santander was hit by
decreased revenue from Treasury and capital markets activities where profits
fell 80.2 per cent to Pta7.2bn. This was offset by a 74.7 per cent reduction
in net provisions to Pta9.5bn.
Santander took the lower provisioning in its stride because it believes the
growth of its non-performing loans has been curbed and its coverage of
doubtful and bad debts, thanks to the traditional conservatism of its loan
policy, remains at a high 100.5 per cent and at 137 per cent if real estate
collaterals held against certain loans are taken in to account.
The group showed the strength of its core banking business with an 8 per
cent rise to Pta125.5bn in net interest income and a 31 per cent increase in
income from fees and commission that raised the operating margin by 13 per
cent to Pta176bn.
The group's operating profit (the operating margin less processing costs)
grew 13.4 per cent to Pta81.6bn.
Mr Botn said a one-for-three Pta89bn rights issue to help finance the
Banesto acquisition had been successfully concluded.
He forecast an improvement in the domestic business environment that would
further strengthen Santander's balance sheet.

FT  27 JUL 94 / International Company News: Group restructure helps Amdahl
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amdahl, the mainframe computer company, yesterday reported strong
second-quarter results following a reconstruction of the group last year.
Net income for the second quarter was Dollars 12.5m, or 11 cents a share,
compared with a net loss of Dollars 23.7m, or 21 cents, in the same period
last year. Revenues declined 15 per cent to Dollars 397m from Dollars 463m.
For the half year, Amdahl earned Dollars 19.6m, or 17 cents a share, on
revenues of Dollars 775.7m.
This contrasts with a net loss of Dollars 263.4m, or Dollars 2.32, and
revenues of Dollars 843.9m in the first half of 1993 when the company took
restructuring charges of Dollars 177.4m after tax.
'The restructuring efforts last year have brought our expenses into line
with current market conditions, enabling us to generate profits on lower
volumes of business,' said Mr Joseph Zemke, president and chief executive.
In the latest quarter, operating expenses declined about 24 per cent from
the same period last year, and gross margins rose to 35 per cent from 30 per
cent a year ago.
'Our objective continues to be the strengthening of established businesses
and the expansion of newer open systems, software and consulting
endeavours,' Mr Zemke said.
In May, Amdahl introduced a new line of massively parallel database servers
developed by its alliance partners Oracle, nCube and Information Builders.
During the quarter, the company began shipping data storage products
purchased from Data General.

This improvement, Sir Philip added, was considered satisfactory by the

Seven new stores had opened in the current year, all of which were trading

FT  27 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Dalepak declines to Pounds 514,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dalepak Foods, the maker of frozen and chilled products, recorded a drop in
pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.21m to Pounds 514,000 in the year to April 30.
Turnover declined from Pounds 42.2m to Pounds 36.9m.
The dividend is cut from 6p to 1.5p, with a final of 1p.
The result, which was foreshadowed in profits warnings, stemmed from a fall
in the main frozen foods division. However, directors said that measures
implemented following a review of that business had ensured that the
division returned to profit in the second half.
Earnings per share dropped to 3.71p (13p).

The split capital Rights and Issues Investment Trust saw net asset value per

Directors stressed, however, that the trust had outperformed its benchmark -
the FT-SE-A All-Share Index - which dropped 13 per cent during the same
period.
They added that the main unquoted investment - Phosyn - had performed well
with record pre-tax profits in 1993 and an intended revaluation of the
trust's 25 per cent stake 'may lead to a material increase in asset values'.
Net revenue for the six months to end-June edged ahead to Pounds 139,476

(2.4p); directors expect to pay a final of not less than 6.5p.

FT  27 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Property disposals help Allied Textile rise
28%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Allied Textile Companies, one of Britain's leading fabric and fibre
manufacturers, yesterday highlighted improving sales and profits on property
disposals as the main factors behind a 28 per cent increase in half-year
profits.
The Yorkshire-based group defied tough trading conditions in the six months
to March 31 by increasing pre-tax profits from Pounds 5.3m to Pounds 6.8m on
turnover of Pounds 69.1m (Pounds 64.5m).
The improvement was underpinned by profits from financial activities, which
more than doubled to Pounds 2.3m (Pounds 1.1m) following the disposal of a
former mill at Huddersfield.
Operating profits in the core textile businesses rose by a more modest 7 per
cent to Pounds 4.5m (Pounds 4.2m), but Mr Peter Honeysett, chairman, said it
represented 'very satisfactory progress in the face of fitful trading
conditions'.
That progress was dominated by steady profits in the UK, where there was a
first-time contribution from Coatings Applications, the Lancashire-based
fabric treatment business acquired last October for Pounds 8.5m.
In continental Europe, however, an improved performance at Allied Textile
France SARL - the group's French subsidiary - was undermined by more than
Pounds 2.5m in start up costs and depreciation charges on a new needle punch
carpet line at Tapibel, the Belgian carpet manufacturer.
Allied's recent acquisitions in North America, where it established a
foothold earlier this year with the Pounds 29.3m purchase of Cleyn &amp; Tinker
and Carleton, did not impact on the half-year figures.
'They have both made a good start and are operating in line with our best
expectations,' said Mr Honeysett.
Earnings per share came out at 15.37p (12.57p) and an increased interim
dividend of 4.8p (4.6p) is declared.
COMMENT
With textile demand in Britain showing little sign of rapid recovery, the
timing of Allied's expansion into North America is looking increasingly
shrewd. Carleton and Cleyn &amp; Tinker are expected to make useful second-half
contributions, which could offset any further downturn at home. Operating
profits may also be enhanced by improved productivity at Tapibel, which
supplies the lucrative German market. However, there are unlikely to be
further gains on property disposals and analysts have left their forecasts
for full-year pre-tax profits unchanged at Pounds 17.5m. The shares, which
closed down 2p at 533p, look slightly over-priced on a forward multiple of
14.4, given the uncertainties over domestic growth.

FT  27 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Looking at life in Europe, for and against
 -Alison Smith and Richard Lapper on a policy split in the UK insurance
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not just Britain's Conservative party that is split on Europe. The UK
life insurance industry is similarly divided into Euro-enthusiasts and
Euro-sceptics over the immediate importance of the European market.
Perhaps the most prominent Euro-sceptic - the Lady Thatcher figure of the
business, so to speak - is Prudential Corporation, the UK's largest life
insurer.
When announcing its new business figures for the first half of the year,
Prudential put great emphasis on its rapidly growing presence in the Asia
Pacific markets, and made only a cursory mention of a decline in annual
premium contracts in Italy.
Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive, believes there will not be a pan-European
medium and long-term savings market until after 2000. He expresses far
greater enthusiasm about opportunities in east Asia, and in China in
particular.
However, a few UK life insurers, such as Scottish Amicable and Equitable
Life, have already given details of how they intend to take advantage of the
new freedoms they have been given by the third life directive, and others
have initiatives planned for the autumn.
The third life directive, which came into effect at the start of this month,
frees the cross-border activities of European life companies by allowing
them to market products directly rather than relying on customers coming to
them. It reins in the powers of local regulators who will no longer set
minimum rates for premiums or control the wording of policies.
Rules governing where policyholders' funds are invested will also be less
restrictive.
Unit-linked policies - which link policyholder returns directly to
investment performance - will become more common. Prices should begin to
level out, giving consumers a better deal.
)Mr John Stone, chairman of Lombard International, a Luxembourg-based
European life insurance company, sees significant advantages for UK
companies which have more sophisticated products and more advanced
information technology.
There are, he believes, particular opportunities in markets which have
traditionally offered the narrowest range and poorest value products, such
as Germany.
Lombard is targeting affluent individuals.
Last year, the group, which benefits from Luxembourg's highly favourable tax
regime, earned about 40 per cent of its Pounds 80m of premium income from
Germany. Other sales came from Belgium, France, the UK and Sweden.
J Rothschild Assurance is another on the Euro-enthusiast wing of the UK life
industry.
In March, it set up J Rothschild International Assurance, which is seeking
to establish links with German regional banks.
Scottish Amicable has also announced a new operation, approaching the
European landscape in two ways. Its Dublin-based subsidiary is to seek
business in Europe, initially through capitalising on its parent's
reputation among independent financial advisers.
In a piece of lateral thinking, it will also use the different tax regimes
in the UK and the rest of Europe as an opportunity to sell from Dublin into
the UK.
The tax differences enable it to produce policies at lower prices than if it
were based in the UK.
The UK system taxes income to policyholders as it builds up in the funds.
Most of the rest of Europe taxes income when it is withdrawn from the fund
and reaches the individual.
Despite Scottish Amicable's move, many UK life companies are conscious of
the different tax regimes as a factor blunting the immediate impact of the
directive.
But there is a feeling that even if the tax question is resolved quickly, as
the Association of British Insurers has been urging, cultural differences
will take longer to overcome.
Many Europeans who are used to a market of highly regulated products may,
for example, shy away from policies which offer them greater risks as well
as greater returns.
Mr Detlef Klaus, partner with Finanzplan, a Wiesbaden-based network of
inter-mediaries, which sells products for Lombard, Friends Provident and a
number of other companies, says that for 'most customers, business will stay
as it is for the next five years. Many people will buy from the
intermediaries they know, and they will not take out highly sophisticated
plans.'
'You have to have distribution and deal in the language and culture of your
customer,' says Mr Richard Giles, head of Sun Alliance's overseas life
business, which has operations in five continental European countries, 'and
the third life directive doesn't alter that'.
So for the time being, the focus for many of the larger insurers is
elsewhere.
Legal &amp; General, for example, has indicated that it intends to concentrate
in the short term on developing its UK operation.
Mr Newmarch is enthusiastic about opportunities in east Asia. Though the
cultural and regulatory barriers are higher than in Europe, they are
outweighed by the sheer scale of the potential market and the speed at which
it could grow.
BAT Industries, which owns Allied Dunbar and Eagle Star Life, also regards
China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan - where the group recently obtained a
provisional trading licence - as a higher priority.
Eagle Star Life has a sizeable presence in Spain and Ireland but is far less
optimistic about expansion elsewhere on the Continent. According to Mr
George Greener, chairman of the two subsidiaries: 'Europe is very
difficult.'

FT  27 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Shandwick ahead by 42% to Pounds 2.47m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLARE GASCOIGNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Shandwick, the public relations company, rose by 42 per
cent from Pounds 1.73m to Pounds 2.47m in the six months to the end of
April, despite a 2 per cent fall in turnover to Pounds 78.7m, against Pounds
80.2m.
Mr Peter Gummer, chairman, said: 'The slow start in North America initially
held back both operating income and profits, but towards the end of the half
year there was a significant upturn in trading in the region.'
North America accounts for more than half of Shandwick's worldwide business,
and margins fell from 19.2 per cent to 18.9 per cent because of new business
expenses.
'Ground lost in the early months in North America has been recovered and
subsequent trading results are well ahead of the comparable period last
year,' said Mr Gummer.
New business levels were 'encouraging', he added.
Shandwick, which raised Pounds 18.9m with a rights issue in March, said
Pounds 16.9m of this would be used to reduce bank borrowings.
Net debt stood at Pounds 69.2m at April 30, up Pounds 1.9m on the previous
year.
Earn-out payments, a hangover from a string of acquisitions in the late
1980s, are estimated at Pounds 2.1m for the year to end-October, of which
Pounds 1.7m has been paid. Earn-out payments for the next two years are
estimated at Pounds 5.5m and all earn-outs end in 1996.
Earnings per share were maintained at 1.7p, and an interim dividend of 0.43p
(nil) is declared.

FT  27 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Approval for Pounds 9.8m Everton rescue
plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders of Everton football club yesterday gave their approval to a
Pounds 9.75m rescue package by businessman Mr Peter Johnson.
The extraordinary meeting held at the club's Goodison Park ground started at
the traditional football kick-off time - 3.00pm.
But it took less than the customary 90 minutes to vote in favour of the
1-for-1 rights issue that is expected to give Mr Johnson, chairman of Park
Food, the Christmas hamper company, and the Nightfreight delivery group,
control of the Merseyside club.
In anticipation, the Everton directors met after the EGM and elected Mr
Johnson as their new chairman.
Shareholders, many of whom had inherited one or two of the 2,500 shares
first issued in 1892 and kept them more out of loyalty to the club than
personal investment, voted Mr Johnson on to the board.
The former chairman of Tranmere Rovers, a rival Merseyside club, needed 75
per cent support for the rights issue motion and received about 1,660 of the
1,680 votes cast. Mr Owen Jones, a former director of BICC, the cables
group, who has a share in the club said: 'There has been a terrible dullness
about Everton over the past few years.'
The cash call has been priced at Pounds 4,000 a share - significantly higher
than the underlying price of about Pounds 2,750. Although existing holders
have three weeks to take up the rights it is expected that none will do so
and Mr Johnson will get 50 per cent of the equity.

FT  27 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Expansion at Filofax with Pounds 5.3m
purchase of Henry Ling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Filofax Group, the USM-quoted personal organiser concern, yesterday
announced an expansion into the greetings cards business with the Pounds
5.3m acquisition of Henry Ling, the privately-owned stationery company.
Filofax, which has embarked on an aggressive acquisition strategy in the
past 12 months, is funding the transaction by raising Pounds 3.8m from a
vendor placing of 2m new ordinary shares at 186p.
It has also agreed to issue 764,185 shares to Ling's directors, who will
remain in place, and has set aside a further Pounds 100,000 to cover share
options held by its employees.
The move follows two months of talks with the Kent-based group, which has
specialised in fine art greeting cards since the early 1970s.
Mr Robin Field, Filofax chief executive, said the two companies served
common customers and could establish a strong presence among retailers such
as WH Smith and Ryman.
'Greeting cards are the largest and still one of the fastest growing
categories in the personal stationery market, and Lings is one of the most
active competitors with a brand name that is very widely recognised and well
respected,' he said.
In the year to March 31, Lings made profits before tax and interest of
Pounds 750,000 on turnover of Pounds 5.8m.
Filofax shares closed up 4p at 198p. Dealings in the enlarged group are
expected to begin on July 29.

The two will also collaborate on research into autoimmune and inflammatory
diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis.
The deal signals Cantab's entry into autoimmune and inflammatory disease
areas.
The work is still at the research stage. Any product it isolated would have
to go through years of clinical trials before reaching the market.

FT  27 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Stancroft's 33% in Devanha
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Nicholas Berry's Stancroft Trust has taken a sizeable stake in Devanha,
the last of the modern broadband cable television companies owned entirely
by UK interests.
Stancroft, which is the largest investor in three public companies - Coal
Investments, Kunwick and Barlow, and Mintel, the consumer research
organisation - has taken a 33 per cent stake in Devanha.
The group has completed the construction of its cable franchises in both
Aberdeen and Coventry. In Aberdeen the company has 16,000 subscribers out of
the 93,000 homes that are passed by the cable network and therefore could
subscribe. In Coventry there are some 10,000 subscribers out of the 117,000
homes passed.
No price was given for the transaction last night, but Mr Graham Duncan,
Devanha's chairman, welcomed Stancroft as an investor. 'The additional
investment will allow us to develop the group in a way which we would not
otherwise have been able to do,' said Mr Duncan. Apart from Aberdeen and
Coventry, Devanha owns several smaller licensed cable systems in England.

FT  27 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Stagecoach shows 46% advance - Acquisitions
bolster outcome / Pounds 33m spent on new vehicles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stagecoach Holdings, the acquisitive Perth-based bus operator, achieved a 46
per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 12.9m to Pounds 18.9m in
the 12 months ended April 30, its first year as a listed company.
Turnover rose by 24 per cent to Pounds 191m, helped in part by contributions
from the three bus companies acquired in the course of the year - East Kent,
Grimsby-Cleethorpes and Western Travel.
Stagecoach also spent Pounds 33m, mainly to renew its vehicle fleet. More
than 650 new buses have been bought in the past three years and a further
680 are on order.
The improvement in Stagecoach's figures resulted from spending on new
vehicles, which reduced maintenance costs; an increase in the number of
passengers carried; and the introduction of new services such as
limited-stop inter-urban routes.
Stagecoach also managed to integrate its new acquisitions more rapidly than
anticipated, largely because they already operated efficient networks of
routes, Mr Brian Souter, executive chairman, said.
When two other acquisitions completed after the year end - of Western
Scottish Holdings and Busways - and the proposed purchase of a 20 per cent
stake in Mainline Partnership are taken into account, Stagecoach has an
annualised turnover of Pounds 275m.
Stagecoach made bids for all 10 of the London Bus companies which are up for
sale and has been short-listed for eight, though the rules governing the
sale would allow it to buy only two or three.
Mr Souter said he did not think the London companies would attain the same
large goodwill premiums as some of the provincial bus companies which have
been sold because the London bus market has not been deregulated.
Stagecoach has picked up some business as a result of the train dispute, but
at the same time has lost passengers on routes which connect with British
Rail.
The company has 'not lost interest' in the idea of bidding for BR franchises
when the train operating companies are sold off, Mr Souter said.
Earnings per share rose from 8.3p to 10.3p and the company proposes a final
dividend of 2.6p compared with the 2.5p forecast at the interim stage. The
total distribution for the year is 4.1p.
COMMENT
Stagecoach has been moving so fast since it obtained a listing 15 months ago
that it has been difficult to keep up with its progress. Followers of the
company will be relieved therefore to hear that the businesses which were on
board before the float have also shown strong growth. Their operating
profits rose by Pounds 2m while new acquisitions contributed a net Pounds
2.5m after redundancy costs of Pounds 900,000. Stagecoach has been able to
buck the industry-wide trend of declining passenger numbers with the help of
new high-quality inter-urban services and an active marketing campaign. The
rail strikes, meanwhile, can only act as a further boost to bus and coach
travel. Mr Souter now plans to expand into London. He hopes the London Bus
companies will not demand the giddy buyers' premiums which have become the
norm in the provinces. He may be disappointed.

FT  27 JUL 94 / UK Company News: US buyer for Switched Reluctance Drives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Switched Reluctance Drives, the Yorkshire-based developer of an innovative
type of electric motor, has been bought by St Louis-based Emerson Electric,
the world's largest producer of electric motors, for an undisclosed sum.
SRD claims world leadership in the technology of switched reluctance drives,
which can outperform standard induction motors in efficiency, speed and
reliability.
The purchase by Emerson is viewed by both companies as an important step for
the development and commercial exploitation of the technology.
SRD has had an uphill battle convincing the industry of the advantages of
its motors.
But Professor Peter Lawrenson, the founder and chairman, believes they could
now take a substantial share in the world electric motor market, worth
Pounds 20bn to Pounds 25bn a year in total.
The technology has been licensed by SRD to about 20 companies worldwide. But
Prof Lawrenson said Emerson was the best partner for SRD because of its
breadth of motor applications, geographic coverage and history of success.
SRD, which employs 30 people full-time, had pre-tax profits of Pounds
282,000 in the year to end-September, on turnover of Pounds 1.6m. It will
remain at Leeds, as a subsidiary of Emerson, with Prof Lawrenson as
non-executive chairman, and Mr William Schnyder joining from Emerson as
chief executive.

FT  27 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Whessoe shares shed 26p on full-year loss
warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Whessoe fell 26p to 108p yesterday after the instrumentation,
control and piping systems group warned it was likely to report losses this
year following a sharp deterioration in trading conditions.
The shares have fallen from 219p in May, when the group said that interim
pre-tax profits had halved from Pounds 4.02m to Pounds 1.89m.
The problems have been blamed on the piping systems division, which has
suffered from a lack of orders, an unsuitable product mix and delays in
existing customer contracts.
Although 'comprehensive action' had been taken to reverse the decline, the
company said it would be inappropriate to pay a final dividend. However, it
hoped to resume payments next year.

FT  27 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Regulatory changes move Misys ahead 23%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Regulatory changes in the insurance industry favouring increased
computerisation and continuing growth in open systems helped Misys, the
acquisitive computing services group, report a 23 per cent increase in
annual profits.
Profits before tax for the 12 months to May 31 rose to Pounds 18.6m, against
Pounds 15.1m last time. Turnover rose 5 per cent to Pounds 93.4m (Pounds
88.8m), although this took in Pounds 7.58m from acquisitions; sales from
continuing operations fell to Pounds 85.8m, reflecting the continued decline
in lower-margin hardware sales.
Mr Kevin Lomax, chairman, said the results represented record levels of
sales, profits and earnings per share and that acquisitions had contributed
only modestly to the final outcome.
The main acquisition during the year was Kapiti, a software house
specialising in financial services, bought for Pounds 38m. Kapiti is based
in the UK but much of its revenue is derived from overseas, increasing the
group's international sales from 3 per cent to 25 per cent.
Kapiti now constitutes Misys' banking services division. Mr Lomax said new
business had been won in Moscow, Hong Kong and Dubai.
Misys' largest operating division is financial services, which serves the
insurance industry. It contributed Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 9.4m) to pre-tax
profits. Mr Lomax said that a development programme aimed at producing new
products based on client/server architectures and open systems technology
was drawing to a close. The products would be launched over the next year
and would be aimed initially at larger accounts where the company has
traditionally been less active.
He said there were few signs of an increase in capital investment in the
company's main markets; changes in the insurance sector suggested the
financial services division would continue to make good progress.
Earnings per share were ahead 19 per cent at 31.9p (26.8p); a final dividend
of 5.06p is recommended, making 8.06p (7.01p) for the year.
COMMENT
Continuing competitive and regulatory changes in the insurance industry,
which have encouraged intermediaries to improve their efficiency through
computerisation, are a significant factor in Misys' profitability despite
the effect of recession on its other main markets. It is likely that the
company can continue to mine the insurance seam for some time ahead, even if
spending has to be pushed up to ensure leading edge technology. Kapiti
should prove a sound foundation for growth in international banking. With
pre-tax growth approaching 15 per cent expected this year, giving a
prospective p/e of about 12, shares are undervalued.

FT  27 JUL 94 / UK Company News: NatWest Markets chief leaves to run fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mike Cornford, head of global foreign exchange at NatWest Markets, has
left his post after less than three months in the job.
Mr Cornford, who was poached from Swiss Bank in order to bolster NatWest's
foreign exchange operation, has been invited to run a hedge fund by a group
of investors.
Mr Stephan Harris, managing director of global treasury at NatWest Markets,
said Mr Cornford had left at his own initiative. 'There is no ill-feeling or
cause for him to leave. It is just unfortunate that this opportunity came
along when it did.'
Mr Cornford is the latest in a number of leading City figures who have left
banking jobs to join hedge funds - highly leveraged pools of speculative
capital, where management fees commonly run to as much as 25 per cent of
profits.
NatWest are not planning to replace Mr Cornford immediately. Instead the day
to day management of the foreign exchange operation will be handled by Mr
Paul Winchester, Mr Frank Wong and Mr Hans Goehtz, the regional managers. Mr
Harris will join these managers on a policy committee to supervise NatWest's
foreign exchange operations.
Mr Cornford was not available for comment and the identity of his backers is
not yet known. It is understood, however, that the offer he has accepted had
previously been on the table and was then revived once he had arrived at
NatWest.
Mr Harris said NatWest was 'very sorry to see him go'. He said Mr Cornford's
view was that it would be less disruptive if he left now rather than when he
was more established.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Deutsche Bank managed a 1 per cent rise in first-half operating profit to
DM2.66bn (Pounds 1.1bn), despite a sharp fall in earnings from own account
trading.
The results were bolstered by a 46 per cent reduction in new provisions for
bad and doubtful debts to DM885m from the DM1.64bn set aside in the same
period of 1993.
Mr Hilmar Kopper, chairman, said that full-year operating earnings would be
above average. Last year's DM5.27bn had been an exceptional result. He made
no dividend predictions but he pointed out that the bank had already earned
the DM780m needed to cover an unchanged payout.
Deutsche, the first of the main German banks to report half-year figures,
made just DM332m on its own account trading, down from DM998m last time.
According to Mr Kopper, profits from own account trading in equities and
securities exceeded expectations but the bonds business fell short of
target.
Provisions for bad debts were reduced after some DM200m of country risk
provisions had been written back because of debt reschedulings.
Mr Kopper said the economic recovery in Germany and improved prospects for
Deutsche's core customers in medium and small-scale businesses had also
helped provisions.
The improved outlook for domestic risks was reflected in a provisions fall
at the German parent, Deutsche Bank AG, from DM1.6bn last time to DM512m.
The amount set aside to cover potential losses from the collapse of Mr
Jurgen Schneider's property business has been set at DM473m - less than the
DM500m announced earlier.
The group's net commission income rose almost 6 per cent to DM3bn, with
positive contributions from most financial service divisions.
Equity sales were the main factor behind rising receipts in the securities
operation, while income from sales of investment certificates and syndicated
business 'roughly matched the good result of last year'.
Net interest earnings of DM5.8bn were virtually unchanged despite a
contraction of 0.12 percentage points in the overall interest margin to 2.09
per cent.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Gencor buys Shell minerals arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Gencor, the South African mining house, is to pay Dollars 1.14bn (Pounds
920m) for most of the metals and minerals operations of the Royal
Dutch/Shell group, which trade under the Billiton banner. The purchase will
satisfy Gencor's ambition of becoming one of the world's biggest and most
diversified resources groups.
The deal includes assets in 15 countries, including bauxite, aluminium,
nickel, zinc and lead interests, as well as a portfolio of exploration
rights and a global metals marketing and trading network. It also includes
Billiton International, which takes in Gencor's Sao Bento gold mine in
Brazil and its 50 per cent share of Richards Bay Minerals, the South African
mineral sands producer.
Billiton draws most of its revenue from bauxite and alumina, raw materials
for aluminium. Combined with Gencor's existing South African aluminium
interests at the Alusaf refinery, undergoing a Dollars 2bn expansion, it
will turn Gencor into the world's fifth biggest aluminium producer. Gencor's
international portfolio will also include coal, gold, platinum, and
manganese.
Mr Brian Gilbertson, Gencor's chairman, rejected concerns that Gencor was
now overexposed to aluminium, saying that after recent improvements in the
aluminium price the combined group was poised to benefit from the economic
upturn.
The price agreed for the assets was Dollars 1.22bn, but an expected
adjustment downwards of Dollars 90m to reflect changes in net capital
employed since December 1992 and a Dollars 15m cash injection to Billiton's
Suriname operations by Gencor brings the value of the deal to Dollars
1.14bn.
Because of exchange control restrictions, Gencor has been unable to finance
the deal from South Africa. Instead it will contribute Dollars 335m in cash,
raised from the disposal of its interests in TransAtlantic Holdings and some
North Sea oil assets, and is borrowing Dollars 430m of seven-year debt.
Shell will retain a stake in the business by subscribing for Dollars 300m of
exchangeable bonds. Billiton will take out an additional facility of Dollars
170m to meet working capital needs.
Shell said the deal would result in an after-tax charge of Dollars 170m but
this would at least be offset by the divestiture of its remaining metals
assets.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Inchcape invests in Coca-Cola's push into Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Inchcape, the international motors, marketing and services group, is to
invest more than Pounds 25m in Coca-Cola bottling franchises in the Russian
Federation.
Although Coca-Cola claims to be the dominant western producer of soft drinks
in the former Soviet Union and in eastern Europe as a whole, it lags rival
PepsiCo in Russia.
However, Coca-Cola has invested Dollars 35m in a bottling plant in Moscow,
already in operation, and will soon see production start from its plant in
St Petersburg, on which a further Dollars 35m has been spent. Together with
the investment planned by Inchcape, Coca-Cola said it was confident it would
soon achieve a dominant market position.
Both Coca-Cola and Inchcape said Russia represented a substantial growth
opportunity. Although Coca-Cola has doubled its sales in the past two years,
western brands account for only about 25 per cent of the soft drinks sold.
The Inchcape franchises are in six of the 12 largest cities in the Russian
Federation, covering an area south and east of Moscow with a population
approaching 50m. They include Russia's third largest city of Nizhniy
Novgorod (formerly Gorky) and Volgograd (formerly Stalingrad).
As a first step, Inchcape has purchased an initial 11 per cent shareholding
in the formerly state-owned Volzhskiy brewery and soft drinks business in
Volgograd. The soft drinks operations will be separated from the brewery,
with Inchcape as the majority shareholder and having management control.
Inchcape and Coca-Cola are also in discussions regarding bottling
opportunities in other countries - particularly in Latin America, the Middle
East and Africa.
Inchcape has been a Coca-Cola bottler in Chile since 1983, operating five
plants and investing more than Pounds 30m in the business, which has become
its largest activity in Latin America with a turnover of Pounds 60m.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Savoy reveals push by Forte for control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The board of the Savoy yesterday brought into the open an attempt by Forte
to gain control of the hotel group without having to buy more shares.
The Savoy board said it had 'become aware of discussions between Forte and
certain of the trusts which have a significant interest in the share capital
of the Savoy. These discussions could extend the level of co-operation
between Forte and these trusts in relation to the management of the Savoy.'
Although neither side would elaborate, the trusts concerned are widely
thought to be those of the Wontner family, represented by Mr John Sinclair,
a Savoy director. If Forte can persuade Mr Sinclair to become its ally, it
will have gained effective control of the Savoy.
Following an acrimonious takeover battle in the 1980s, Forte acquired 68 per
cent of Savoy's shares but only 42 per cent of its votes. Support from Mr
Sinclair would give Forte a clear majority of the votes.
Backing for Forte from the Wontner family trusts would not be without its
ironies. Sir Hugh Wontner, the former president of the Savoy group who died
in 1992, fiercely opposed a Forte takeover.
Sir Anthony Tuke is likely to remain Savoy chairman for the time being.
Savoy and Forte have been unable to agree on a successor. The latest
candidate, Sir Roger Gibbs, chairman of the Wellcome Trust, is thought
unlikely to be approved.
A successful outcome at Savoy would be welcome news for Forte, which earlier
this year was beaten by ITT Sheraton of the US in its attempt to take over
Ciga, the Italian luxury hotel chain.
Forte's bid to win control of Meridien, the French chain which is 57 per
cent owned by Air France, looks uncertain. Accor, the French hotel group,
has argued that it should win Meridien, despite submitting a lower bid than
Forte.
Wasserstein Perella, the US investment banking boutique acting for Air
France, has asked Forte to examine new information. City analysts believe
the exercise may result in Air France finding a justification to sell the
chain to a French buyer.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Why the birthday bond is a party-pooper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the Bank of England celebrates its first 300 years (yes, today is at last
the Old Lady's real birthday), it is relishing the unusual prestige of
central banking and the tantalising talk of 'independence'.
But in Threadneedle Street there is one tiresome party-pooping problem - the
high level of real interest rates which the Bank regards as some kind of
market anomaly related to the inability of the obstinate markets to accept
that inflation has permanently fallen to a very low level.
Also today the Bank happens to be holding one of its gilt-edged auctions,
the first for a long while to offer a reasonably long-dated bond (with a
16-year maturity, in fact). If inflation is to stay around 2 per cent the
real interest rate on this birthday bond will be more than 6 per cent, a
rate at which the Bank is very reluctant to fund for lengthy terms.
To underline its hesitation the Bank has chosen an issue with a 6 1/4 per
cent coupon, even though this means the sale will be at a big discount (of
about 17 1/2 per cent) so the yield to redemption will be at the market rate
of about 8 1/4 per cent.
The Bank is kidding nobody here - and even when the long gilt yield did fall
fleetingly below 6 1/2 per cent at the end of last year it failed to exploit
the tactical opportunity to launch a long bond issue.
However, the Bank of England can count itself lucky to be facing only a 6
per cent real yield. In Canada the 10-year bond yield is 9.2 per cent and in
Australia 9.6 per cent, while inflation in those two nations is zero and 1.4
per cent respectively.
For governments that have become used to defrauding investors through
inflation these high real rates appear formidable. The average annual real
return on UK gilts between 1946 and 1993 was minus 0.1 per cent, very
satisfactory for the public purse.
However, in the process much of the natural domestic investor base for
government bonds was wiped out, and it will only be rebuilt slowly and
painfully.
In any case, periods of very high real returns on government bonds are
regular historical phenomena. During the 1920s and 1930s, for instance, real
gilt-edged returns averaged 7 or 8 per cent. This came about, however,
because retail prices were falling, and nominal yields were not as high as
now.
If inflation is to remain positive, as seems likely in most countries other
than Japan, high real rates in the 1990s can only be achieved through
nominal interest rates of a level that central banks will find alarming.
Such historical periods of high rates have reflected necessary financial
adjustments after unsustainable credit expansions. Although this time
governments in the US, Japan, Sweden and elsewhere have prevented collapses
of their banking systems they have often done so only by borrowing vastly on
their own accounts. In Sweden the price has now correspondingly gone up to
11 per cent.
As for inflation, it may be quiescent but a study in the Bank of England's
last Quarterly Bulletin showed that nearly all the inflation in the Bank's
300-year history has happened since 1945 (and the rest was mostly caused by
the Napoleonic wars or the First World War). Such peacetime inflation has
been a triumph, you might say, for the Bretton Woods agreement, which this
month celebrates a mere 50th birthday.
According to the BZW Equity-Gilt Study a 6 to 8 per cent real return is the
kind of return expected from equities. The danger for the central bankers
funding profligate governments is that they now depend on speculative bond
investors who trade actively up and down the yield curve and from country to
country and look for capital gains rather than yield. Instead of sleepy
trustees and doddery grannies they must nowadays look hedge fund managers in
the whites of the eyes.
There is hope. British pension funds are reported to have raised their UK
fixed interest exposure from 3.3 to 4.2 per cent in the second quarter.
The bad news is that UK retail prices have risen 67-fold since the Bank of
England was established in 1694. The good, if doubtfully relevant, news is
that is only 1.4 per cent a year.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Rwanda leader says UN role could ease crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KIGALI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The presence of UN human rights monitors in Rwanda to guarantee the safety
of returning refugees would be acceptable, Gen Paul Kagame, the strongman of
the country's new government said yesterday.
Gen Kagame, the commander of the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front, which took
control of the country last week, said he wanted to persuade the millions of
Hutus who fled in fear of his Tutsi-led guerrillas to come home. 'They have
to give Kagame a chance to prove he is not what he has been portrayed to
be,' he said.
The propaganda of the ousted Hutu government, which Gen Kagame fought for 3
1/2 years, depicted him as an ogre.
Yesterday, in his well-cut civilian suit and gold-rimmed glasses, Gen
Kagame, who has assumed the posts of vice president and defence minister,
looked more like a university professor than a soldier. He appears much
older than his 37 years, having spent more than a third of his life as a
guerrilla in the African bush.
Perhaps because of a life spent in exile, Gen Kagame insists Rwanda needs a
new political ideology that might break the cycle of ethnic hatred which has
plagued his small nation for decades.
'Not all Hutus took part in the genocide of the Tutsi community,' he said.
'Not all Tutsis were feudal overlords in the past. We need to create a
country that belongs to all Rwandans. We need to educate people on how to
live together again.'
He defended the dominance of the RPF in the new government, which includes
four other political parties and Hutus in prominent posts. 'The RPF will
have a strong voice in the new government if necessary,' said Gen Kagame,
who prefers to speak English, instead of French, Rwanda's official language.
'This country needs to move. Someone must give it direction and a
programme.'
It was Gen Kagame's philosophy of a united Rwanda that prevented the RPF
wreaking massive revenge upon the Hutu population for the massacre of the
Tutsi population that began in April. That was sparked by the death of Gen
Juvenal Habyarimana, the country's former president, in an air crash.
Gen Kagame says those who did not take part in the massacres have nothing to
fear. But he pledged to bring all suspects to trial. He says the RPF is only
holding 'a few dozen' prisoners of war. He says he would welcome an
international war crimes tribunal.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Underwriting fees for rights issues too high, says report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Securities firms and fund managers earn excessive profits on their standing
fee for underwriting corporate rights issues, according to a report drawn up
for the Office of Fair Trading.
The so far unpublished report, prepared by Professor Paul Marsh of the
London Business School, concludes that the risks taken by securities firms
do not justify the standard 2 per cent commission.
The OFT commissioned the research 18 months ago as part of an inquiry into
why all companies had to pay the same underwriting fee to sell new shares
regardless of the widely different risks involved.
The OFT has not decided whether it fully accepts the report's conclusions,
and is currently seeking the views of City practitioners.
The report draws no conclusions about whether the standard fee is the result
of anti-competitive activity, and it is believed that the OFT has found no
evidence of a cartel.
However, OFT officials are said to be privately concerned about the possible
operation of a 'complex monopoly'.
It is expected that the OFT will publish the report within the next two
months, with the intention of prompting debate between companies and
underwriters. If companies find that they are unable to negotiate
alternative fee structures, the OFT may refer the matter to the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission for review.
Together with the report, the OFT is expected to publish a summary of
criticisms from securities firms and institutional investors who share
underwriting commissions.
A number of leading firms have told the OFT they believe that publication of
the report is unnecessary and will damage the City's reputation.
The London Investment Banking Association and the Institutional Fund
Managers Association are among those organisations which have sought
meetings with the OFT to express their concerns.
'It could appear that this is another City scam,' said one City figure who
has had a meeting with the OFT.
He argued that the report was flawed, partly because it did not take account
of the cost of the capital which securities firms must provide to
participate in underwriting.
Moreover, he said that although underwriting commissions were standard,
varying degrees of risk were reflected in the size of the discount at which
new shares were offered for sale.
The report analyses profits earned on a series of underwritten rights
offerings, including the effects of the disastrous share offering for
British Petroleum in October 1987.
Even excluding the effects of that offering, which was said to have wiped
out five years of UK underwriting profits, the standard 2 per cent
commission offered higher returns than were justified, it says.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Life insurers to ease policy on HIV queries: Initial fears
about commercial risk unfounded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK life insurers are to stop asking potential clients whether they have been
tested for the HIV virus, which causes Aids, in an admission that the
industry's initial fears about the commercial risk from the condition have
proved unfounded.
Insurers in future will ask only whether an applicant has received a
positive test result or undergone treatment.
Under current practice, an applicant who admits having been tested is often
refused a policy or offered one only at a higher premium, even if the test
result was negative. This reflects the industry's assumption that only
people who considered themselves 'high-risk' sought such tests.
But the Association of British Insurers said yesterday that testing for HIV
had become much more common over the past few years, both for screening
purposes and personal reassurance. Mr Tony Baker, ABI deputy
director-general, said insurance companies had decided it was 'no longer
appropriate or necessary' to ask applicants for new life insurance policies
to say if they had had a negative test, although insurers would need to know
if a test result was positive or treatment had been received.
Since 1987, when the current question was introduced on to application
forms, British insurers have paid out more than Pounds 50m for deaths where
HIV or Aids is thought to have been a factor. This is considerably less than
the industry had expected.
Although the number of people annually diagnosed with Aids is still rising,
the number of reported deaths caused by the condition has fallen for the
past couple of years. This reflects improvements in the treatments
available, increasing people's chances of surviving longer.
The ABI said it had asked its members to bring in the change as quickly as
possible, which would in most cases be when questionnaires were reprinted.
Mr Peter Roth, chairman of the insurance working party of the Aids charity,
the Terrence Higgins Trust, said the change was 'long overdue and removes
concerns about mortgages and insurance that deterred many people from
seeking an HIV test'.
Mr Ivan Massow, an independent financial adviser who has written Britain's
first finance guide aimed at gay people, said the change could mean that
life insurers would gain more information about their customers.
He said the current question had driven HIV/Aids testing 'underground', with
people seeking tests anonymously from clinics instead of from their GPs.
This gave insurers no way of cross-checking the answer.
Under the new rule, if the stigma attached to testing disappeared, more
people would seek tests from GPs, who would ask them about their sexuality
and number of sexual partners. That information would then be available to
life companies even if the applicant had tested negative.

FT  27 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Forte/Savoy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Savoy's stock exchange statement contained many mysteries; not least, why it
made it at all. The announcement added little to market knowledge and was
chiefly remarkable for what it left unsaid. Doubtless, Forte thinks it
worthwhile talking to the shareholding trusts about co-operation between the
two hotel groups. It may well have much to offer in terms of joint marketing
agreements, reservation systems and staff training. But the real unspoken
point at issue is that of control. The long-running war for Savoy is hotting
up again.
Forte already speaks for 42 per cent of the voting shares but its standstill
agreement not to buy more shares complicates matters. Forte is clearly
growing restless and appears to have blocked the proposed appointment of Sir
Roger Gibbs as Savoy chairman. In talking to the family trusts, Forte is
opening up another front and must be hoping to win majority control without
resorting to a bid. The trusts may well be more amenable given the Savoy's
dismal trading record and the halving of its dividend last year. The
company's weighty non-executive directors now have a critical role to play
in encouraging any constructive proposals from Forte while defending the
interests of all shareholders.
Forte badly needs a success. The company was embarrassingly wrong-footed in
its attempts to buy the Ciga hotels and it now appears as though the
Meridien chain might evade its grasp. Some forward momentum is required if
Forte's shares are to sustain their lofty rating.

FT  27 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Gencor/Shell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gencor has been trying to buy Royal Dutch/Shell's mining interests for over
a year, so it is a relief that a deal has finally been struck. Untangling
the web of pre-emption rights surrounding assets held in joint ventures has
been the main sticking point. Shell has also had to supply Dollars 300m of
low-cost finance to get the deal away. It is a measure of the forces driving
both sides that these problems have been overcome. Gencor badly wanted a
deal which would propel it into the top tier of international mining
companies. Shell has realised what BP acknowledged back in 1989: that oil
companies bring nothing to mining.
The question is whether yesterday's deal will do for Gencor what the
acquisition of BP Minerals did for RTZ. Much turns on commodity prices.
While RTZ took a gamble on the copper price and won, Gencor is placing a
similar bet on aluminium. Since it is buying near the bottom of the
commodities cycle, the odds appear to be heavily stacked in Gencor's favour.
While there are risks of a price correction, the recovery trend is clear.
Integrating its new mining assets with aluminium smelting and stainless
steel manufacture in South Africa should also bring benefits.
It is not clear that Gencor's big step on to the international scene will be
enough to entice foreign fund managers. Complex cross-holdings, poor
liquidity and the cumbersome mechanism of the financial rand are all reasons
for international funds to steer clear. If these barriers come down, though,
Gencor may have just lifted itself towards the top of the shopping list.

FT  27 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Deutsche Bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At one level yesterday's first-half results from Deutsche Bank are an
extraordinary measure of the organisation's inherent strength. Despite a
DM473m hit from the Schneider affair, the bank managed a small increase in
operating profits after provisions. The release of sovereign debt provisions
and the extraordinary gain from the sale of stakes in Daimler-Benz and the
Karstadt store group certainly helped. Presumably, too, the bank has drawn
on its hidden reserves - in this regard German bank accounts remain opaque.
But the fact that, after Schneider, it was still able to report a fall in
net bad debt provisions closely in line with the drop in its trading income
is an indication of its ability to overcome formidable operational setbacks.
Less satisfactory is what the results say about the underlying business
development. The loan book is stagnating and the interest margin is coming
under pressure, a trend that should continue with the introduction of money
market funds. Trading income is likely to remain depressed. Also doubtful is
whether commission income will continue to grow at the same pace in the
second half.
In short, Deutsche looks like another case of a bank facing growth
constraints. Having already cut its bad debt provisions by 46 per cent,
there is less room for an earnings boost from improving bad debts as the
economic recovery continues. The results may have been somewhat better than
the market expected but there is no longer- term reason for the shares to
out-perform.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is ironic that the strongest CBI quarterly trends survey since before the
recession should also contain seeds of worry about the future. One is the
familiar concern about the disappointing level of investment spending. The
other is the first signs of inflationary pressure: companies report that
unit costs rose slightly over the past four months and are expected to
continue on this track over the next four. The main problem seems to be
higher raw material costs. Steel prices, for example, have begun to rise,
albeit from a low base, and companies must be acutely aware of other input
price increases in train or in the pipeline.
The temptation will be to pass on these extra costs rather than absorb them
in their margins. To do so could prompt the Bank of England to start raising
interest rates again. But the CBI is probably right to suggest that it is
too early for the Bank to take pre-emptive action. It will need to see how
far price increases stick first, and that is a matter of some doubt.
Besides, there are grounds for suspicion that respondents to the survey are
over-stating the upward pressure on unit costs. Companies tend to look only
at costs at this stage in a recovery and underplay the operational gearing
effect that comes with increased volumes. That is another reason for them to
make sure margins really are squeezed before they push too hard on prices.
Otherwise they risk unnecessarily irritating their customers as well as
higher borrowing charges.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Grey on top, thinning below: Reform of the French pensions
system could have far-reaching effects on industry and the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Philippe Bechet says he could always do with a bit more money, but he
does not grumble about his pension. Like most of France's senior citizens,
who are entitled to a full pension after 37 1/2 years of contributions, the
former sales manager receives more than half of his previous salary from the
state pensions system.
His children, however, and the rest of their generation cannot regard
retirement with such calm. Demographic trends, which will increase the
proportion of over-60s in the population from about 20 per cent today to
about 27 per cent in 2020 and a third in 2050, are putting state pensions
under unbearable strain. Last year, the 'pay as you go' system, in which
pensions are paid from contributions from the current workforce, incurred a
deficit of some FFr40bn (Pounds 4.8bn).
The realisation of a gathering crisis is pushing France towards a
far-reaching reform of its pensions system, with implications which extend
far beyond the purses of the over-60s. The changes under consideration could
establish powerful private pension funds, provide a significant stimulus to
the Paris stock market and, in the long run, reshape the structure of French
capitalism.
Some important steps are already under way. By early next month, a law is
due to take effect which will provide tax incentives for artisans and
independent workers who invest in private pension schemes. The law, called
the Madelin Law after its architect, Mr Alain Madelin, minister for
enterprises and economic development, will affect an estimated 1.7m workers.
One of its aims is to encourage the expansion of private pension schemes so
as to provide a complementary retirement income to the state system.
Mrs Simone Veil, minister for social affairs, has also moved to ease the
burden on the state pensions system. Last year she reformed existing
legislation to extend from 37 1/2 years to 40 years the period which people
need to work to qualify for a full pension. She also announced that the full
pension would be calculated, from this year, on the basis of a person's 25
best-paid years, rather than an average of the 10 best-paid years, which
will result in lower benefits.
These changes, combined with the allocation of revenues from increased taxes
on tobacco and higher social security contributions, will reduce the
pensions pay-as-you-go deficit this year. But they are not enough to remedy
France's underlying structural pensions problems. As a result, the
government has faced increased pressure for the creation of a broader system
of capitalised private pensions, as exist in most industrialised economies,
in which employees invest in pension funds to finance their retirement.
The creation of such pension funds is 'urgent and indispensable', says Mr
Ernest-Antoine Seilliere, vice-president of the Patronat, the French
employers' association. 'Reforms should be adopted as quickly as possible,'
he says.
In principle, the government agrees. In January, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the
economy minister, said he 'greatly hoped' to introduce a bill on pension
reform to the National Assembly during the spring. Since then, however, the
timetable has slipped. Mr Alphandery is now aiming to introduce a bill
during the autumn parliamentary session.
The delay is the result of two factors. Reform of the state pensions system
is politically sensitive and has provoked opposition from some trade union
groups, which participate in the management of the present system. They
perceive pension reform as an attack on their influence and claim that it
will act against the interests of the lowest-paid, since it is the wealthy
who will be more able to contribute to private pensions systems.
'Private pensions are theft,' says Mr Marc Blondel, general secretary of
Force Ouvriere, the union organisation.
At the same time, the government is anxious not to nip France's emerging
economic recovery in the bud. 'A reform of the pensions system would
encourage more long-term savings and could dampen consumption,' says Mr
Jean-Francois Mercier, economist at Salomon Brothers, the securities house.
Employees would effectively be paying into an additional, private pension
scheme, on top of the existing two-tier state system and pay-as-you-go
system.
Despite official foot-dragging, however, most observers believe the creation
of capitalised private pensions is now a question of when, rather than if.
'I am convinced that within one year or 18 months we will have private
pension funds,' says Mr Jacques Friedmann, chairman of Union des Assurances
de Paris (UAP), France's largest insurance group, and a confidante of Mr
Edouard Balladur, the prime minister. He describes the Madelin Law as a
significant step to this end.
Mr Friedmann is not alone. Politicians, business groups and industry
associations, aware that reform is on the way, have been busily preparing
their own plans for pensions systems in an attempt to sway the bureaucrats
at the economics ministry who are working on Mr Alphandery's proposals.
Among the most influential suggestions are those from Mr Jacques Barrot,
chairman of the National Assembly's finance committee, and from the
Patronat. Mr Barrot calls for the creation of capitalised pension funds,
which would complement rather than compete against the existing state
system, and which would provide tax incentives for companies and employees
to invest in pension funds. These funds would be set up by individual
companies themselves, banks, insurance groups and other financial
institutions.
Mr Barrot recommends that at least half of pensions contributions should be
invested in equities, and that a proportion of employee contributions should
be invested in employees' own companies. The funds would, however, be
managed outside the company. This, he believes, would create a balance
between the UK pensions system, in which pension funds are managed
independently of companies, and the German system, where pension
contributions are incorporated in company balance sheets. As in Germany,
this might require an insurance scheme to protect pensioners against
corporate bankruptcies.
The Patronat, by contrast, argues that companies themselves should decide
whether pension funds should be managed internally or externally, and that
they should be allowed to manage all of the funds themselves and add them to
their balance sheets. The employers' organisation also wants employees to
have the choice of taking their pensions in a lump sum or through annuities.
Mr Barrot is opposed to payment in a lump sum.
The debate, which has also drawn proposals from the Association of French
Banks and the French Association of Private Enterprises, centres on these
questions of internal versus external management, rules governing the
division of investment between stocks and bonds, and the form of payment.
For some involved in the debate, Britain's experience of the Maxwell
scandal, in which Mr Robert Maxwell, the late publisher, plundered the
company's pension scheme, has raised concerns about internal management of
pension funds. While French companies favour the use of pension funds to
bolster their balance sheets, others question the extent to which companies
should reinvest the pension contributions from employers.
'Employees already have their jobs tied up with the company. It may not be
desirable for them to have their pensions tied up there too,' says Mr Jan
Twardowski, president of Frank Russell Securities of the US.
The method of payment of pensions has also drawn a sharp divide between
France's banks, which favour the availability of a lump sum pay-out, and
insurance companies, which support annuities. 'Everyone is pushing the
system which favours their own expertise,' says Mr Alain Leclair, deputy
president of asset management at Banque Paribas, the French investment bank.
He sees it as an unnecessary battle, which has hindered the process of
reform.
The battle, however, highlights the importance of the stakes involved. 'It
will be a huge market in the future for us,' says Mr Friedmann of UAP. 'Just
for the Madelin Law there will be perhaps FFr10bn to FFr15bn in premiums;
for a broader private pensions system the market will be hundreds of
billions of francs.'
The competition to manage these funds will be tough, with insurance
companies, mutual savings groups and banks all vying for a slice of the new
business.
'The creation of a capitalised system of pension funds will not happen
overnight,' says one insurance industry executive. 'But most of the
potential competitors are already developing products to cash in on the
market.'
One of the most important effects will be the creation of powerful
institutional investors, a con-sideration which looms large in the
government's thinking.
'The government sees the opportunity to kill two birds with one stone,' says
Mr Leclair at Paribas. In addition to easing pressure on the state pensions
system, the creation of pension funds will strengthen the country's
financial markets, he says.
For the French government, this is an important incentive. The Paris bourse
has grown steadily in recent years - but, with a capitalisation of
FFr2,600bn at the end of June, it remains smaller than some international
rivals such as London, which had a market capitalisation of Pounds 757bn for
domestic equities at the same date. The creation of powerful institutional
investors, such as pension funds, would help the government develop the role
of Paris as a financial centre.
'If you take a long-term view, then the best returns on investment are in
equities,' says one economist at a French merchant bank, pointing to
statistics which show an average rate of return for an investment in French
equities of more than double the return for an investment in bonds over the
past 10 years. 'So the creation of pension funds should shift funds to the
bourse and give it a strong institutional base.'
One important advantage of this would be to support the French government's
ambitious privatisation programme. Launched in autumn last year, with the
sale of Banque Nationale de Paris, the programme includes the sale of 21
public sector groups, expected to raise more than FFr250bn. As Mr Alphandery
puts it: 'As long as important privatisations are in the pipeline, our
country must have funds which have the large part of their holdings in
shares.'
But the implications for the corporate sector spread far beyond public
sector companies slated for sale. Pension funds could also help remedy what
Mr Elie Cohen, a professor at Paris university, refers to as 'capitalism
without capital'.
Because of the lack of big institutional investors and the stable long-term
shareholders they represent, French industry has been forced to seek
alternatives. One such has been a relatively high reliance on bank loans and
direct equity investment by banks. Another has been the creation of complex
systems of cross-shareholdings, in which companies form so-called noyaux
durs - groups of core long-term shareholders. The recent privatisations
illustrate the trend. For example, Elf Aquitaine, the oil group, and Banque
Nationale de Paris, one of France's largest banks, took stakes in each other
as they left the public sector.
Both recourses, however, have their drawbacks. The experience of Credit
Lyonnais has also shown the limitations of the bank-industry relationship.
The state-owned bank, which lost FFr6.9bn in 1993, has outlined a plan to
dispose of FFr20bn of assets over the next two years as part of its
restructuring efforts. Many of the assets to be sold are equity stakes in
French companies, heralding a reversal of the industrial banking strategy of
Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, the former chairman.
The pattern of cross-shareholdings is also open to criticism. 'The system
can reduce the rigour of shareholder discipline,' says one industry observer
in Paris.
'There is a risk of cosy corporate relationships based on self-protection
rather than the maximising of returns. There is also the question of whether
it is the best use of corporate funds to have them tied up in shares in
another industrial group, rather than investing them in the company's own
core businesses.'
Such considerations are far from the thoughts of the retired sales manager,
Mr Bechet. But the changes unleashed by the need to provide for his
offspring could also resolve a long-standing weakness in the financing of
French industry and transform the nature of the economy from which they
retire.

Beleaguered British beef exporters, fearful that new European regulations on
'mad cow disease' could ruin their livelihoods, can hardly have been cheered
by the disarming frankness of their new minister for agriculture.
Not only did William Waldegrave - whose own Someset dairy farm has had cases
of BSE - readily admit that his new charges were in for 'quite an
uncomfortable transition period', but he also let slip that his ideal summer
supper menu comprised chilled vegetable soup, a compote of fresh berries

The May wedding of Social Democratic prime minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen and
Lone Dybkjaer, a member of Denmark's Radical Liberal party, was a discreet
affair. The couple had been living together for two years, and they were
anxious to avoid making any undue public fuss as Dybkjaer was in
mid-campaign for the European parliament.
Safely installed in Strasbourg, however, she and her husband gathered the
press together in June to announce the glad tidings.
So the Danish official who recently compiled the new MEP's biography can
hardly have reckoned with its subject's incensed demands that mention of her
marriage to the prime minister be deleted. 'It is completely unacceptable
that private details of this kind should be mentioned in an official
biography,' she asserted.

<TEXT>
As a cure for post-cabinet blues, John Patten flew to the pages of The Daily
Telegraph yesterday in an altogether admirable effort to shift the
Conservative party off its collective hind quarters. Observer was pretty
impressed by the Patten prose too. How elegantly was the 'prize at the end
of the perpetual political rainbow' juxtaposed with the 'seachange' that
'will take 30 years or more to see through'. How forcibly did the author
convey the desirability of 'encouraging the little battalions to be our
social warp and weft'. Should his words be doled out to GCSE English
language students to study and reflect upon? The former education secretary
mentions in passing how in 1979 he 'swapped life in the intellectual theme
park for life in the political one'. One can but hope his journey 15 years
later into the theme park of scribblers will be equally smooth.

It is surely another sign that things are returning to normal after last

out-and-about on non-bank business. Buxton is taking over from Sir David
Lees as chairman of the CBI's economic affairs committee, and was yesterday
on show at Lees' last presentation of the Quarterly Trends survey. Buxton
agreed that it would have been harder to find the time for such public
duties had he not split the role of chairman and chief executive. Yes, he
confided, he had indeed been reluctant to split the job so quickly after
taking the tiller at the bank, but he had eventually succumbed to pressure
from institutional investors. Now, with the arrival of Martin Taylor in the
chief executive's seat, he professed himself a total convert. 'I'm a walking
advertisement for splitting the roles,' was his comment.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Observer: The spunk of Munk
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Oak Mines of Vancouver, which bid for Toronto-based mining group Lac
Minerals earlier this month, was presumably disappointed when the big guns
of American Barrick rolled in with a rival offer at the beginning of the
week. But perhaps Royal Oak's executives should extract a glimmer of comfort
from Barrick chairman Peter Munk's rather formidable schedule in coming
days.
On Monday, the Hungarian-Canadian entrepreneur went straight from briefing
analysts and journalists on his Lac intentions to his first lunch and board
meeting as chairman of Trizec, North America's biggest publicly-traded
property developer. Horsham, another Munk-controlled enterprise, has become
Trizec's main shareholder after investing more than Dollars 500m to keep the
developer afloat.
Today sees him in St Louis for the board meeting of another Horsham
subsidiary which is edging towards the purchase of a Texas oil refinery. All
this follows a special American Barrick directors meeting 10 days ago at
which Munk and his colleagues decided to press ahead with a feasibility
study for a Dollars 170m gold mine in Peru.
July normally sees Munk cooling his heels on his private island in a bay off
Lake Huron. But it is perhaps no coincidence that this burst of activity
comes at the height of summer. One visitor to the island retreat was taken
aback to find a relatively modest cottage - lacking a dishwasher. Putting
together blockbuster business deals surely beats drying dishes.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Old Lady at three hundred
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At 300 years of age the old lady of Threadneedle Street has a new vitality.
Mr Eddie George, the governor, enjoys a public influence over British
monetary policy unequalled at least since the days of Montagu Norman. The
Bank must show it deserves the position history has given it.
Over the half century since its nationalisation, the Bank has been a silent
accomplice to a fraud. That can be the only just description for a 30-fold
reduction in the value of its liabilities. It is little wonder that
governments have lost so much of their credibility. Not only have they
perpetrated theft on a scale unmatched by any private fraudster, but full
employment, for which the value of the pound was sacrificed, has been
further from achievement in recent years than in any previous period, with
the arguable exception of the 1930s.
Fortunately, recognition that this has been a mistake is now widespread.
Chastened by a series of disasters that ended with sterling's summary
expulsion from the ERM in September 1992, the government has handed an
exceptional degree of influence over monetary policy to the Bank. Armed with
the 1-4 per cent inflation target, the Bank's inflation report and, most
important, with the publication of minutes of meetings between himself and
the chancellor of the exchequer, the governor has, if not the power to
decide, at least the power to destroy Mr Clarke's credibility.
Mr George must now prove he has both the courage to use his influence and
the wisdom to use it wisely. He does have the right instincts. In Mr Rupert
Pennant Rea, a controversial appointment as deputy governor, he also seems
to have the right assistant. Unlike his boss, the deputy is interested in
management. By focusing the bank's structure on the tasks of monetary and
financial stability, Mr Pennant Rea has helped provide the appropriate
framework for a re-invigorated Bank.
For all that, the Old Lady is assured of no comfortable future. The quality
of its judgement of monetary policy is on test as it has not been since the
early 1930s. Under the cover of secrecy, it has avoided blame for the
disasters of recent decades. That is a luxury it no longer enjoys.
Even the Bank's role in supervision is on trial. This is not only a question
of recovering its reputation after the harsh report by Lord Justice Bingham
on its handling of the BCCI closure. It is also one of whether hands-on
banking supervision is desirable at all.
As Mr Donald Brash, governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, has noted
in a recent article in the FT, 'depositors might well argue that, since the
public sector established the rules within which banks must operate, and had
access to vastly more detailed information on bank financial strength than
was available to the public, the public sector has a very strong moral
obligation to protect depositors in the event of a bank failure.' It is
partly for this reason that his country has moved to market-based banking
supervision. The Bank of England argues that New Zealand is a free-rider on
the supervisory activities of others. The question remains, however, whether
supervision improves the safety of banks, without also increasing the claims
of depositors upon the supervisor.
The Bank may even find itself swallowed up within what it seems bound to
regard as a premature move to economic and monetary union within the
European Union. That judgement would almost certainly be right, but it would
still be a mistake to assume such a move cannot occur this decade. Would the
UK have the nerve to stay outside? If not, the Bank of England might have
gained only an Indian summer of visible influence over monetary policy. Be
it short or not, let it ensure this is a bright one.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Leading Article: China trade
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Taiwan's statement yesterday that it is ready to meet the full obligations
of a developed country on joining the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
looks shrewdly calculated. In seeking thus to force the pace of its
membership negotiations, Taiwan has thrown down a challenge to Beijing and
to Gatt members' acceptance of China's demands that it be admitted first.
The move comes at a delicate stage in China's Gatt accession talks. Beijing
hopes to conclude them in time to become a founder member of the World Trade
Organisation, due to succeed the Gatt early next year. However, though the
political atmosphere has been improved by the US decision to renew China's
Most Favoured Nation treatment, decisive breakthroughs have yet to be made.
Recent talk in Beijing of presenting Gatt with an accession package in
September on a 'take it or leave it' basis does not bode well for rapid
agreement.
China's size and economic potential make it desirable that it be admitted to
Gatt as soon as possible. However, clear conditions must be set for its
entry if it is not to risk destabilising the organisation. Above all,
Beijing must introduce far more transparency into the workings of its
economy which, for all its recent reforms, is still patterned on the state
trading model. It should also commit itself to a fixed timetable for
conforming fully with Gatt rules, and to regular international monitoring of
its progress.
That argues for granting Beijing a post-entry transition period, a
concession which the US, alone and unreasonably, opposes. However, China
must also be prepared to negotiate constructively. Any refusal to do so
should not become a pretext for the Gatt to soft-pedal negotiations with
Taiwan, or to delay its admission, once satisfactory terms are agreed. To
exclude the world's eleventh largest exporter in deference to the demands of
a large country, which is not even a member, would betray Gatt's central
principles.
Furthermore, there is no obvious legal basis for requiring that Beijing be
admitted first. The new WTO charter neatly sidesteps the contentious issue
of Chinese sovereignty by defining members as states and customs
territories, not as governments. The Gatt should overcome its fears of
antagonising China and break the artificial link between the two sets of
accession negotiations. To do so would not only be fair; the prospect of a
race between Beijing and Taipei to complete accession talks would
concentrate minds in both capitals.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Labour's report
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In one sense, it is unfair to assess Mr Tony Blair's leadership of the
Labour party on the basis of yesterday's policy paper on education. He has,
after all, been leader for less than a week. As for the paper, its contents
were determined by the party's labyrinthine policy-making committees long
before he took up the reins. Yet the prominence Mr Blair accorded education
in his leadership campaign means that some sort of assessment is
inescapable.
On general sentiments, the paper cannot be faulted. The importance of skills
and knowledge in the modern economy is undeniable. The failure of the UK
education system - in particular, English schools - to deliver either in
sufficient quantities is widely accepted. Few will disagree with the
proposition that the quality of education must be raised.
On detailed policies, there is also much to welcome. Broadening the scope of
A-levels and a professional structure for the teaching profession are
necessary steps. An expansion of nursery education is also desirable. In
launching the paper, Mr Blair rightly emphasised the importance of standards
and discipline in schools. He also made much of the need to build on the
Conservative reform that gave schools control over budgets, in order to
increase their autonomy.
But Mr Blair's well-crafted presentation could not disguise the continuing
impact on Labour's education policy of the teachers' unions. The paper
attacks Ofsted, the new inspection service set up to inspect schools more
frequently, as insufficiently independent of the education secretary. It
rejects the use of tests to monitor schools and teachers. And it describes
school league tables as simplistic and flawed, and 'not acceptable' as
management tools. Parents and taxpayers need simple and objective measures
of school performance, including the examination results which are so
important for children's life-chances. Instead, Labour promises a deluge of
information that will let underperforming schools off the hook.
The verdict - in the words of school reports over the years - is 'must try
harder'. If Mr Blair is serious about putting education at the centre of his
agenda for national renewal, he must ensure that Labour's policy papers
match his rhetoric. A clearer focus on the ends of education is needed, with
less influence for the producers. A first step would be to find a new shadow
education secretary. Mrs Ann Taylor, the existing incumbent, appears out of
step with his priorities.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Cool reaction to hot problem: David Lascelles examines the
costs of making defunct nuclear power stations safe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I bet it will read nought when we come out again,' said Peter Webster,
picking up a small radiation meter. And through the gates we went.
Before us stood two gutted buildings, the remains of Berkeley, the UK's
first commercial nuclear power generator, on the banks of the Severn
estuary. Shut down in 1989, the station is being decommissioned in the first
exercise of its kind in the UK, and one of the few in the world.
We clambered over rusting pipework, peered into cooling ponds and ended up
standing on top of one of the station's two nuclear reactors.
A team of men was washing it down with solvent. They were not clad in thick
protective clothing, just overalls and gloves. And they chatted as they
worked. All rather ordinary, considering that beneath their feet stood a
graphite core which had once contained highly radioactive fuel rods.
'Radioactivity is like powder,' said Webster, the station manager. 'If it is
on the surface, you can usually wipe it off.'
Later, when we left the site, the dosimeter did indeed read nought. 'It's a
fairly mundane activity, decommissioning,' said Webster. 'It's just
construction in reverse.'
His offhand remarks were meant to sound cool. The nuclear industry is keen
to put across the message that defunct nuclear power stations can be made
safe. But whether it can do it efficiently and within budget is one of the
important tests of the nuclear review which the government is now
conducting.
According to the National Audit Office, the UK's nuclear clean-up bill
amounts to some Pounds 18bn for decommissioning 18 power stations and 17
other radioactive sites, such as British Nuclear Fuels at Sellafield. But it
does not include the Pounds 4bn-Pounds 5bn recently added to the Atomic
Energy Authority, whose original budget was understated 'because of
optimistic assumptions and significant omissions' - a miscalculation which
underlined the uncertainty that clouds the decommissioning debate.
The cost of this clean-up falls mostly on the electricity consumer, who pays
a 10 per cent levy in England and Wales and an artificially high price for
electricity in Scotland. But these arrangements are being phased out, and
the nuclear industry is supposed to be self-financing by 1998.
In Berkeley's case, the clean-up is one of the more difficult that faces
Nuclear Electric, its owner. As the first of its generation, the station was
clumsily engineered. The two reactors contained 85,000 fuel rods, and were
connected to tall heat exchangers by hundreds of yards of large-diameter
piping. The heat exchangers were smothered in smaller pipes and coated in
asbestos. All this metalwork was contaminated internally by radioactive
water.
The decommissioning of Berkeley began in 1989, and is proceeding in three
stages. In the first, the fuel rods were individually removed, stripped of
their cladding and shipped to Sellafield. Over nearly three years, that
disposed of more than 99 per cent of the high-level radioactive waste.
The work is now in the second stage. This will get Berkeley into a condition
where it can be left for many decades while the remaining radioactivity
decays. For this, the large pipework has been chopped up and sealed off. The
heat exchangers are being cleaned and laid on their sides, and the buildings
weather-proofed.
Intermediate-level waste, which includes the fuel rod cladding, is also
being removed. This will be stored in concrete vaults on the Berkeley site,
because the government cannot agree on plans for a national store  - which
is another issue for the review.
The second stage of Berkeley's decommissioning is due to finish at the end
of next year. What happens after that is a matter of some debate.
Government policy requires Nuclear Electric to remove the most dangerous
waste and leave the station in a safe condition for 100 years, at which
point it can be taken to bits. But Nuclear Electric is trying to promote a
more extended timetable. At future stations, it wants to postpone the
completion of stage two (that is dismantling all but the most contaminated
parts) for 100 years. After that, it would dismantle the reactor and either
return the site to greenfield condition, or mound the remains over.
This longer timetable would benefit Nuclear Electric in two ways: it would
reduce costs, because much of the radioactivity would have decayed by the
time the company came to deal with the most contaminated sections. It would
also enable Nuclear Electric's financial provisions to accumulate interest
over a longer period, enabling the company to discount them much more deeply
and set less money aside in the first place. The company estimates the total
discounted cost of decommissioning all its sites would be Pounds 1.9bn under
the longer timetable, compared with Pounds 2.7bn at present.
The modified policy would raise the commercial appeal of the nuclear power
industry and make it more suitable for privatisation.
Another argument in support of a long timetable is that nuclear waste
technology is likely to improve over time, which could further simplify
decommissioning. As it is, Nuclear Electric claims that the experience
gained at Berkeley suggests cost estimates are too high. The first stage -
the removal of the fuel rods - cost Pounds 40m compared with an estimate of
Pounds 70m. The second stage looks like beating its Pounds 120m budget. The
third stage, which would include looking after Berkeley for a century and
returning it to a greenfield site, is estimated at Pounds 300m.
But the extended timetable has been attacked from a number of quarters. In a
report, published this spring, the Science Policy Research Unit of Brighton
University, a leading academic centre for energy studies, says that
long-term decommissioning runs serious financial risks. If a station had to
be shut down early, there would not be sufficient provisions to finance a
clean-up. Also, small errors in forecasting interest rates could lead to
large shortfalls in provisions.
The SPRU study also argues that, while decommissioning technology might
improve, environmental standards would probably be raised, so the cost
hurdle might not fall.
The main focus of environmental concern is the risk of leaving a radioactive
site for this long, even in a cocoon. Green groups point out that other
countries, such as France and the US, have much shorter timetables for
decommissioning. But their stations are based on pressurised water
technology, which is simpler than the UK gas-based system.
In Wales, environmentalists plan to fight proposals to decommission the next
plant on Nuclear Electric's list: Trawsfynydd in Snowdonia. Their opposition
is based largely on the danger of mothballing a radioactive site in an
earthquake zone, but they also argue that every generation should clean up
its own mess.
The SPRU report supports this view: 'Even if future generations will have to
do the work and bear the health risk, they should not be left a financial
burden as well.'
One option the government will have to consider is whether the state should
underwrite the cost of cleaning up existing nuclear power stations. This
would free Nuclear Electric from a heavy financial burden. But it would
merely shift the cost of provisions from the electricity consumer to the
taxpayer. And anything that reduced the cost to the nuclear industry would
strengthen the case for getting decommissioning over as quickly as possible.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Structural change answer to US
deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Professor CHARLES KENNEDY and PROFESSOR A P THIRLWALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Professor Maynard's letter on US foreign indebtedness (July 22) is
admirably short, consisting of just two sentences. Unfortunately, the first
sentence, although true, is trivial; and the second does not follow from the
first. He states that 'the US's trade problem (if there is one) lies in the
country's low propensity to save, not in an overvalued exchange rate'.
Every first year student of economics knows that from the national accounts
the balance of payments deficit on current account is necessarily and
identically equal to the excess of domestic investment over saving, but by
their second year they ought to know that it is a logical fallacy to infer
causation from an accounting identity.
If Professor Maynard wishes the trade balance to be tackled by raising
saving (and/or reducing investment) has he thought what that might do to
output and employment domestically? He does not seem to envisage the
possibility that the simultaneous use of two types of measure might be
required.
As the late Professor Tinbergen taught us many years ago, if there are two
objectives - internal as well as external balance - then two policy
instruments are required from their achievement.
There is a case for dollar depreciation, as Professor Wynne Godley and Mr
William Milberg originally argued (Personal View, July 6). On the other
hand, one should not expect too much.
In our view, the US deficit, like the UK deficit, has deep structural roots
which will only be rectified in the long run by structural change and
stronger non-price competition against the more aggressive trading nations
of south-east Asia, particularly, of course, Japan.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Air France - a revenue problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr A J LUCKING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While I agree with much of your editorial, 'Flight plan for Air France'
(July 25), I believe some factors need more emphasis. The wise men's report
indicated that costs and staff productivity at Air France were similar to
those at British Airways, although some suspect that the latter's costs are
also higher than they should be. An earlier report to the Commission showed
Air France's air crew as 12 per cent more productive, and its recovery plan
includes a reduction of 1,300 flying staff.
Figures for 1992, published by the Association of European Airlines, show
that, if Air France had secured the same revenue rate on its domestic
network as did British Airways, it would have earned Dollars 828m more. Many
of the French domestic routes are unprofitable, often because the traffic is
very low. Where government considers they are vital to the regional
economies, they should be subsidised separately, after the lowest bidder has
been selected. Good domestic air links are a vital factor in securing
foreign investment in the regions, a point overlooked in the UK as domestic
air links to Heathrow are run down.
On the London-Paris route between 1990 and 1993, the sterling on-demand fare
rose 32.5 per cent, whereas the franc fare rose 13 per cent. British
Airways' highly sophisticated yield control computers also enabled it to
secure a much larger share of the passengers paying the higher fares. The
Air France recovery plan includes 'a performance yield management system',
and this is the vital tool to extort the maximum possible amount from the
on-demand passengers in particular.
Generally, I suspect, the problems are as much on the revenue as the cost
side. And in making profitability comparisons, one should not overlook the
advantage conferred by the low rents paid by BA for the nearly 6m sq ft of
premises at Heathrow, which were set out in the January 1987 prospectus. For
example, until 2005, the annual rent for the 629,500 sq ft cargo centre is
Pounds 239,710, that is 38p per sq ft. Net of services, similar nearby
buildings are priced at about Pounds 15 per sq ft.

Sir, Getting the most from information technology (Mr John Dodd, Letters,
July 23, commenting on previous articles) could be given a considerable
boost at quite a small expense.
The difference between being literate (being able to read) and being
computer literate (being able to operate some program) is enormous but
unnecessary. Today, F1 summons the 'help' menu in many programs. To save,
print, create a graph, or whatever else one may wish to do, involves
different sets of key strokes in different orders, according to the program
in use.
If hardware manufacturers can agree protocols to allow computers (and fax
machines) to communicate, it must be possible for software writers to do the
same. The saving for companies (even nations) would be enormous.

FT  27 JUL 94 / High price of dallying: The world should not have to
improvise a response to each crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'They are asking the wrong question,' says an unnamed aid official in
London, quoted in this week's Sunday Telegraph. 'It is not 'what went
wrong?' (in Rwanda) but 'what can we do now?'.'
Actually, it is vital to ask both questions. Many things can and must be
done now, but for hundreds of thousands of people the effort comes too late.
Even restoring the survivors to their homes, health and happiness is a task
beyond the powers of the so-called international community. It is vital to
ask whether, and how, this tragedy could have been averted if we are to have
any hope of averting any others like it.
And there are further questions which must be asked. What are the obstacles
that prevent us from responding adequately to the current crisis? And what
must we do to ensure that, next time, we can do better? In each great
disaster a terrible price is paid because the response has to be improvised.
The supplies and equipment needed are always somewhere, but precious weeks
are lost while they are located and transported to the place where they are
needed.
On the humanitarian side, things have improved in this respect. The
Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA) at the UN in New York has, for the
first time, been able to play its assigned role of co-ordinator among the
different bits of the UN system and the voluntary relief agencies, and it
has drawn on the emergency 'rolling fund' set up to enable the system to go
straight into action. But this fund is only Dollars 50m - not adequate for a
disaster on the Rwandan scale, for which the UN last week requested Dollars
435m in donations from member countries.
The main shortcomings of the UN system, however, are clearly in the
politico-military area. Humanitarian action is impotent in conditions of
raging war, such as prevailed in Rwanda from April to June this year. The
DHA opened its office in Kigali on April 23, but the staff were pinned down
in shelters, unable to move.
Since then, the exodus of the Hutu population has created problems on the
Rwanda-Zaire frontier which cannot and should not be tackled by humanitarian
means alone. It seems appallingly callous to say so, but the epidemic of
cholera now sweeping through the refugees has its positive side, since it is
persuading many of them that the risk of returning home may be less than the
risk of staying where they are. But such ghastly means of 'persuasion'
should not be necessary. The task of repatriating the population is, above
all, a question of security and confidence - in other words, a political
task with a military component.
All accounts agree that a key role in urging the Hutus to flee, as
previously in egging them on to genocide against the Tutsis, was played by
the nominally independent Radio-Television Libre des Mille Collines. It was
urging the population to flee for their lives, and promising that the
Rwandan armed forces would launch a war of 'reconquest' once they had a
chance to regroup on Zairean territory - until last week, when it went off
the air, possibly closed down by the French.
These broadcasts should have been jammed long ago, and the UN should have
been in a position to put out counter-broadcasts, giving the population a
clear account of what was actually happening. It did this with great success
in Cambodia. Member states should endow it with the capacity to set up an
objective public information service as the first priority in any conflict
or potential conflict in which it gets involved. The existing press and
information department in New York, which spends its money inviting
journalists from well-heeled western newspapers on 'fact-finding' tours of
the Middle East and elsewhere, should be closed down.
It is futile for member states to blame the UN for not acting quickly or
effectively enough in Rwanda-type crises when they do not give it the
resources to do so. Once again the UN is very close to bankruptcy, with
Dollars 3.2bn outstanding in members' contributions. But it is not only a
question of money. Back in May the Security Council decided to send a force
of 5,500 troops to Rwanda. At most, half that number will be in place by
mid-August, and even then they will have no proper equipment unless the
French can be persuaded to leave theirs behind.
Rich white countries are less and less willing to put their forces under UN
command. At most they will undertake quick in-and-out operations,
'authorised' by the Security Council, within their own sphere of influence -
France in Rwanda, Russia in Georgia, the US in Haiti. For the long haul,
poorer countries are expected to provide the manpower. But they have no
equipment - and it is no good fobbing them off with unserviceable armoured
personnel carriers left lying around in Europe since the end of the cold
war.
The UN needs a reserve of ready-to-use military equipment, just as it needs
a larger emergency fund to pay for humanitarian supplies. Ideally, it should
also have a reserve of volunteer manpower, perhaps a 5,000-strong brigade,
trained and ready to fly to any crisis point to which the Security Council
decides to send it, to hold the line until member states assemble the force
needed for a longer-term commitment.
Members of the Security Council are said to be angry with the secretary
general for proposing this week that the UN force in Bosnia should be
withdrawn. They should, instead, be grateful to him for drawing attention to
the gap between the task they keep assigning to the UN and the resources
they are willing to give it.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Prediction likely to be bad bet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL L BYRNE

<TEXT>
Sir, Surely Laura Thompson ('Keep betting in the dark', July 25) is still
living in the days of prohibition by suggesting that government deregulation
is bad for the betting industry.
She should perhaps reflect on the benefits to the consumer within the
brewing and drink retailing industries in the provision of improved leisure
facilities. The standards of comfort and catering have never been better.
Her prediction that 'the bright new betting shops will lose more customers
than they attract' will certainly prove to be one of her worst bets.

<TEXT>
It seems unfair on that admirably-run country that the state of Denmark
should be associated in an English idiom with rottenness. There are other
states where the rot is palpable and the individual David squares up to the
Goliath of the establishment in vain. A sling is not much good (to mix
metaphors) if the faceless men keep moving the goalposts.
Last week's viewing provided an uneasy thread of Kafkaesque bureaucracy
closing ranks against the seeker after truth. In Channel 4's Frontline
Queenie Fletcher, mother of the WPC murdered outside the Libyan embassy in
1984, tried to act on her simple belief that someone somewhere must know who
shot her daughter. Disturbing puzzles emerged: the trade embargo ignored,
official indifference, and a final meeting with Colonel Gaddafi that took on
the unreality of a nightmare. Unexpectedly sent for by the Libyan leader,
Queenie found herself on the platform at a rally, urged to make a speech to
a cheering crowd. She returned to her suburban home shaken by the layers of
obfuscation attending the tragedy, not least on the part of British
officialdom. The guarded smoothness of hatchet-faced Douglas Hogg summed it
up.
It showed up Michael Moore's TV Nation as the televisual equivalent of junk
food. The cutesy idea of making a gnomic faux-naif in a baseball cap ask
penetratingly simple questions about such agonising problems as the Bosnian
war soon grated. You might as well send Norman Wisdom to interview Saddam
Hussein. Moore himself is an unnecessary American import; the British are
quite capable of providing pseudo-profound whimsy (especially on radio where
Ray Gosling's lugubrious drone or John Walters' witless bellow trigger a
Pavlovian lunge to the off-switch). The best item, from Moore's glamorous
female sidekick, concerned brokers who buy life insurance policies from
those with Aids and cash in: a rich Dickensian gallery with nervous giggles
and hairstyles that resembled one of the late Queen Mary's toques, they were
a jolly lot. As one cheerfully prognosticated, 'the next growth area of the
market is cancer'.
One wonders how far the tiresomely droll Moore would have got with the
Kennedy clan. Inside Story Special: Chappaquiddick (BBC 1) revealed that
pressure was exerted on her paper to sack reporter Liz Trotta for asking
awkward questions of the senator for Massachusetts. It was 'raw power
reaching out . . . just naked,' said the splendidly unscathed Trotta in John
Edgington's 25th anniversary reminder of the drowning of Mary Jo Kopechne.
Teddy behaved as remarkably as the dog in the Sherlock Holmes story. The
dog, you remember, did nothing. Only the convolutions of American
politics-cum-morality could sustain the latest theory: that Kennedy was not
even in the car when it plunged into the water but claimed to have been the
driver to avoid a possibly worse scandal - a degree of judgment that makes
one thankful he never became president.
But what of the individual opposing not corruption or vested interests, but
the law itself? BBC 1's Heart of the Matter, tucked away on Sunday night,
poses meaty problems week after week and should not be taken for granted.
Last week's survey of gentle lawbreakers - anti-road activists, the man who
assaulted youths who were terrorising his mother  - and the rather less
gentle animal rights campaigners was memorable for the appearance of yet
another Hogg: Quintin, Lord Hailsham, who chillingly detected the seeds of
civil war in the honourable tradition of civil disobedience, equating it
with world-wide strife - Catholic/ Protestant, Islamic/Jewish, and what he
disdainfully dismissed as 'hootsi and tootsi'.
This sensitively compassionate approach would doubtless have no truck with
political correctness. One expected an equally rebarbative attitude in
Richard Littlejohn - Live and Uncut (ITV). In fact the scourge of liberalism
is more complex than given credit for, as anyone who knows his flailing
castigation of the present government's brazen veniality will testify.
Littlejohn is in the English tradition of fundamentalist puritan small-town
morality. He would have joined Cromwell's New Model Army in that Thatcherite
manifestation before its time, the Great Rebellion, with its City money,
mercantile class support and grim dogmatism.
In Friday's discussion on PC, Littlejohn managed to unite a lefty MP with
the chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation against him, not to
mention the exquisitely enunciating Brian Sewell.
Nobody behaved like a stereotype. Black Labour MP Diane Abbot was bubbly,
funny, articulate and un-rancorous. Lord Archer was - would you believe
bubbly, funny, articulate and un-rancorous? No statutory Hogg being present,
it fell to the director of the Howard League for Penal Reform to ooze
sanctimoniousness.
Which brings us naturally to Sir David Frost. 'Money doesn't grow on trees
but it may be growing on your family tree,' he burbled at the beginning of
Good Fortune] on 'Christmas Day in July' - or Sunday, in the slot associated
with That's Life. Esther Rantzen may have irritated but she was never as
embarrassing to watch as this clammy, dowdy fumble at populist TV, pitched
at a level as low as ITV at its most cynical and then some.
Outside broadcast units ambushed punters with unexpected inheritances. A
woman in the audience was presented with a competition prize she was unaware
of having won, having moved to the Outer Hebrides as if in presentiment. A
book on the Royal Family at Pounds 17.99 presented by a Queen lookalike made
one wonder if it was worth it. Another audience member, due to go on
holiday, was told by Frost that a forgotten premium bond had come up and she
had two million - the studio screeched and whooped as he desperately added
'Turkish lira' - the equivalent of Pounds 50.
Elements of Surprise] Surprise] and This Is Your Life reduced even
reconciliations between families long separated (why? one ignobly asked) to
a Roman spectacle with screaming crowds. 'You haven't done nothing,' laughed
Sir D reassuringly to (or at) a nervous courier inveigled into a crowded
studio to receive marvellous news for himself and 'your glorious family'.
'Not bad, is it?' Frost kept asking anxiously as the programme foundered on
ineptitude after ineptitude. 'I've been adopted by a load of ducks here]'
chortled reporter Adrian from location. The camera moved back to reveal a
totally duck-free stretch of water. Adrian was also shut up in
mid-interview, as were several of the punters who were obviously meant to
stay lachrymose, grateful and silent. 'Who do I thank for this?' asked
Phyllis, rather grim-faced at meeting her son again after 20 years. Frost
replied in a supremely cynical moment of truth: 'John Birt.' And so say all
of us. The BBC was once known as the greatest broadcasting organisation in
the world. There is certainly a whiff of rot around, but from much closer to
home than the Skagerrak.
Christopher Dunkley is on holiday.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Arts: Fascinating look at academic dance - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Abandoning fond thoughts of an igloo, we went to the Coliseum on Monday
night to be lightly broiled, and to watch the start of English National
Ballet's summer season. Dancers like and need heat, their muscles responding
gratefully to temperatures that make the rest of us steam. (The sweat spins
off the men in pirouettes as from a shower-head.) The programme was the
all-dance triple bill on which I reported from Edinburgh's Festival Theatre
last week. I think it a good choice, for it shows the company as stronger
than for several years. The two opening items - The Kingdom of Shades scene
from La Bayadere and XNTricities, that recent Italian acquisition - provide
a fascinating display of what has happened to academic dancing from Imperial
Petersburg in 1877 to London in 1994.
The fourth act of Petipa's great Indian spectacular was the ballet blanc
expected by his audience. Moonlight (ENB's lighting wrong on this count: too
glaring) and a cohort of women as ghosts, with the ballerina as focus and
spiritual heart of the event. Long chains of movement, technical display at
its sublimest, and a frisson of emotion to trouble this nocturnal set-piece.
ENB's corps looked very good as Shades, moving with the proper inevitability
and sense of exultant spirituality.
I was less happy about the three soloists - their variations are jewels of
the rarest quality, and they seem to think them paste, and dance accordingly
 -and Margaret Illman cannot find that transcendent grace and spirituality
which lie at the heart of everything Nikiya, the ghostly heroine, does. Her
role is a statement about enduring love and about the need for Solor, her
beloved, to be true to her. Miss Illman is an able dancer, but the role is
not about that.
The chief joy of the staging is that it shows Thomas Edur yet again as the
finest classical danseur we have. Every canon of academic art is satisfied
in his performance. His style is pure, the dance set out with utter
integrity, with no concessions to applause-catching. The role lives, and
Edur finds its poetry, its character, in the movement - there is a lift, an
exultant grace to each step, an inborn dignity to the least gesture. We
understand Solor (who is the conventional hero of such ballets) and we
understand the unique and hard-won glories of classical technique, in the
grand curve of a leap, the lift and grace of a pose. Here is noble dancing -
in the greatest traditions of ballet - and it is worth travelling a long way
to see.
Mauro Bigonzetti's picture of academic dancing in XNTricities (and my
admiration of the piece stops short at this stupid title) is frenetic,
sexually blatant, and altogether of its time, as was Petipa's moonlit drama.
Its merits are Bigonzetti's sense of choreographic progress, his ability to
use a clanking electronic score and not be driven mad by it in front of our
eyes, and the splendid performances he has inspired from his cast. The
spectral bayaderes of half an hour before become predatory, strutting women
who pose and kick and twist as they face men no less eager for the battle of
the sexes. It is like Petipa's display in providing fantasy images, and like
Petipa, Bigonzetti knows how to shape movement. I would admire the piece
even more were it ten minutes shorter, but it is compellingly well danced -
the cast enlarged since it was first seen earlier this year - and admirably
lit.
The evening ended with Etudes, that 'Forty-minute Louvre' rush round the
dancer's daily labours. It will always delight audiences, who love its
sure-fire combination of pirouettes and triumphant smiles, but both
production and performances need a sharper edge and greater authority than
was manifest on Monday. But with ENB on its present upward path to glory -
and long may that continue - these qualities will come. I would like to see
the company's account of Etudes in a year's time.
English National Ballet's summer season is sponsored by Nomura. The Sleeping
Beauty is at the Coliseum until Saturday July 30. ENB continues at the
Festival Hall from August 2 to August 13 with Beauty and Coppelia.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Arts: A crooked Lady Windermere's Fan - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For many years now it has been impossible to play Lady Windermere's Fan
straight, unless to an improbably innocent audience. (Perhaps 50 years ago
in England; in the rest of the world, at least 80.) It was Oscar Wilde's
first professional play, and it is hopelessly split.
If we relish Oscar's wit in the marginal chat, we cannot take Lord and Lady
Windermere's lofty protestations about marriage very seriously; but if we
cannot do that, the very hinges of the plot become quaint and ludicrous. At
the Albery Theatre, Philip Prowse's production - imported from the
Birmingham Rep - plays it crooked.
On the one hand the fringe characters, who get most of the familiar,
subversively witty lines, are encouraged toward shameless camp, which makes
the Windermere ball in Act 2 a decidedly louche affair, wildly unlikely in
its period (or at least unreportable). On the other, both Windermeres are
treated at face value, as fanatic idealists who pass absolute moral
judgments upon others. They are only half-confounded at the end; the last
thing we see is Lord Windermere in a brown study, deeply baffled because he
has misunderstood everything.
Well he might, however, for there is an 'on the third hand' too: Francesca
Annis's Mrs Erlynne. She gives her the full Joan Collins treatment in public
 -scandalous, surely, at a respectable Mayfair gathering? - but manages some
nice feeling in her anguished private confessions. (I have to deny you the
full facts, since some of you won't know the play; it will be enough to say
that the adventuress Mrs Erlynne is more than she seems.) As Wilde wrote her
she is an eminently presentable, savvy woman-of-the-world, whereas Miss
Annis makes her a larger-than-life siren.
Though Miss Annis just about reconciles her flamboyant persona with discreet
moments of real emotion, it is a near thing. Prowse's handling of the
subsidiary personnel is too gross: we have no reason to believe in
strangulated Victorian mores when hardly anybody on stage seems to believe
in them. By Act 3 in the Prowse version, the first-night audience was
greeting every lofty Victorian declaration with raucous laughter.
As young, well-heeled Windermere, with only two years of marriage behind
him, Rupert Frazer is peculiarly stiff and curdled. Amanda Elwes is worse:
she cannot talk Wilde's rarefied lingo with any semblance of naturalness, so
she aims at unspoken character instead. By Act 3 that makes itself felt a
little (we remember her attractive performances on TV); but both the earlier
acts - in this version - begin with a lot of her, and she delivered her
lines like a robotic alien. The initial banter with her vain swain Lord
Darlington (Simon Dutton) was hopelessly leaden, her melodramatic Act 2
scena devoid of the least conviction.
That was not altogether her fault (though one felt that Central School might
have prepared her better). The real trouble is that as Wilde wrote her - his
original title for the play was A Good Woman - she now seems at best a prig
and a ninny, at worst a raving hysteric; and Miss Elwes, grave and
humourless, plays her for real. What Wilde intended for the Windermeres,
which was idealised rapture founded upon inexperience, turns into
puritanical craziness. We do not believe a word of it; and so they, not the
mockers, become the out-of-joint outsiders.
Perhaps that is what Prowse intended. If so, it carries less conviction than
his own sumptuously OTT sets: a huge boudoir for Acts 1 and 3, artfully
off-centre and festooned in deeply unlikely hues for Victorian times, and
between them - for Lord Darlington's rooms in his club - a dramatic crescent
of grand chinoiserie. That was warmly applauded.
There are a lot of enterprising actors in short-breathed roles. Jennifer
Hilary makes a ripe Duchess of Berwick - if too modern and knowing, in the
generous room this production gives her - but almost vanishes after the
first act, as does Marianne Morley's crisp Lady Jedburgh. (Wilde's parade of
fictitious titled characters, both onstage and off, seems absurd now: why
should they be titled? what does it matter?) Frank Middlemass's Lord
Augustus, broad and lovable, and Leonard Kavanagh's discreet butler remind
us pleasantly of how such roles used to be played - simply,
straightforwardly and clearly.
At the Albery Theatre (071-867 1115).

The ever popular Desmond Morris is back again with an examination of The
Human Animal (BBC 1 at 9.30), but he seems to be repeating himself with yet
another programme about body language. We all know by now that some people
shake their head sideways to say yes and that it is very easy to insult the
Japanese. Still it is all good fun, laughing at mankind's little physical
oddities in the name of popular science.
Children of God was the religious cult best known for using sex to make
conversions. It was thought that the days of 'hookers for Jesus' were over
as the cult attempted to clean up its image and rename itself The Family.
But this expose by a former member suggests it still goes in for some very
dubious rituals in Witness (Channel 4 at 9pm).
Speaking in Tongues (BBC 2 9.25), the first of six new studio plays, has
much going for it. The producer is Simon Curtis; the writer Tony Merchant;
and the stars are Bernard Hill and Lesley Sharp. He is a redundant miner
playing the role of a 19th century workman in a theme museum; she earns
money chatting down a sex line.

FT  27 JUL 94 / People: Rathbone Brothers - the heritage continues
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Family traditions in the City die hard, and none more so than at Rathbone
Brothers, the private client banking and asset management group, where
William Rathbone, 58 - the tenth of that name and a direct descendant of the
company's founder - has just joined the board as a non-executive director.
Rathbone, right, is currently director and chief executive of the Royal
United Kingdom Beneficent Association (Rukba), a UK charity working on
behalf of the elderly.
But his main business assocation was with The Ocean Group, the marine
freight services company, which he joined in 1959 and stayed with for 29
years, working in Liverpool, West Africa and London. His numerous activities
with the group included developing a tanker and bulk division.
He joined Rukba in 1988. The charity has an annual turnover of Pounds 8m,
with 300 full-time employees and 750 volunteers.
It has been 96 years since the last William Rathbone was involved in the
management of the eponymous company, founded by William Rathbone II in 1742,
when it was a merchant and shipbuilder, based in Liverpool.
William Gair Rathbone VII - great-grandfather of the new appointee - retired
as a partner in the firm in 1898, when Rathbone's London office closed, not
to re-open until 1988, when Comprehensive Financial Services merged with
Rathbone.
The company's newest director has two children - including William Rathbone
XI.

FT  27 JUL 94 / People: Shaw steps down at Premier
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Only two months ago, Roland Shaw, chairman of Premier Consolidated
Oilfields, wrote to the FT pointing out that at 72 he was a mere stripling,
compared to Armand Hammer who ran Occidental until he was over 90. But
yesterday the US-born Shaw announced he was stepping down on August 3.
Expansive in every sense, Shaw has been a large figure in the UK independent
oil sector for more than two decades, having nursed Premier through good
times and bad. His towering presence was said to be one reason why Premier
never got gobbled up like other North Sea minnows.
Shaw had already relinquished his executive role at the company 18 months
ago. He hands over his remaining role to Richard Cox-Johnson, a
non-executive director, until a permanent replacement is found. But this
will not mark Shaw's final departure from the oil patch. He will continue to
give time to Heritage Oil and Gas, where he is chairman, and to other oil
interests.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Business and the Environment: Common sense policy-making -
Jeremy Kahn on an overhaul of US environmental regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEREMY KAHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Carol Browner, head of the US Environmental Protection Agency, thinks she
has discovered what has been missing from US environmental policy - it's
called common sense.
Years of EPA anti-pollution effort have left 'a complex and unwieldy system
of laws and regulations, and increasing conflict and gridlock,' says
Browner, who has proposed a big shake-up in the way the agency is organised
and looks at pollution.
The Common Sense Initiative, announced by Browner last week, advocates
looking at pollution on an industry-sector basis, rather than targeting
specific pollutants.
The EPA has had some successes. It has effectively banned the chemical DDT
and successfully fought against asbestos. But the agency too often gets
entangled in its own conflicting policies, such as supporting smokestack
scrubbers that cleaned up factory air emissions but added to water
contamination. Such conflict would lead to internal clashes as the water and
air divisions worked at cross-purposes.
Under Browner's initiative, the EPA may eventually be reorganised along
industry lines with divisions representing, say, oil and gas refining or
automobiles. The EPA chose six sectors for the pilot programme of Common
Sense: iron and steel, electronics and computers, metal plating and
finishing, automobiles, printing and oil refining. These make up 15 per cent
of US gross domestic product and collectively release 345m lbs of toxic
waste per year. That is 12.5 per cent of all toxic waste emissions reported
to the EPA.
The new strategy aims to encourage closer, more amicable contact between
business groups, environmentalists and the EPA.
Browner wants to make US environmental policy more proactive, with
regulation based on long-term planning rather than coming in response to
crises, such as the much-criticised Superfund, which provides federal funds
to clean up hazardous waste.
Common Sense has strong supporters, among conservation-ists and the business
community.
The Printing Industries of America, a national lobby
group which developed its
own joint anti-pollution effort with the Environmental Defence Fund,
strongly endorses the EPA reforms. Mary Marra, director
of the environmental quality
division of the National
Wildlife Federation, said the
EPA changes 'are probably a
good idea'.
But some, including environmental groups, are sceptical. The National
Audubon Society - the environmental group which led the fight to ban DDT in
the late 1970s - criticises the EPA for abandoning an approach that seemed
to be achieving success and for limiting the flexibility and range of future
options.
Maureen Hinkle, Audubon's director of agricultural policy, says: 'Some of
the other approaches are being thrown in the waste basket and I don't think
they should be so summarily discarded.' She also fears that environmental
groups would be at a disadvantage in the time-consuming negotiations
advocated under the initiative, as they lack industry groups' resources.
Others, such as Greenpeace, like the sound of the new approach but worry
that Browner may be pulling a public relations stunt. 'It's way too early to
judge it, but I think Common Sense has great potential,' Rick Hind,
legislative director for Greenpeace's toxics campaign, says. However,
Greenpeace is 'dubious about the concern about minimising environmental and
industry conflict,' and he adds that the best way to minimise conflict is to
have a good pollution prevention programme.
Browner's supporters point to her record in reforming the Superfund
legislation. When talks on Superfund reauthorisation collapsed, she stepped
in to get them started again to forge new compromises between the
government, business and environmental groups.
It is now up to Browner to convince others - including in her own agency -
that Common Sense makes sense.

FT  27 JUL 94 / People: Minchin takes over as SFA deputy chairman
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Minchin, 62, has been appointed deputy chairman of the Securities and
Futures Authority (SFA), taking over from Andrew Winckler, 45.
Minchin is also chairman of the SFA's enforcement committee, and a board
member of Lloyds Bank Stockbrokers.
He has been a board member of the SFA, and its predecessor, the Securities
Association, since 1988. Until recently he was also a board member of the
London Stock Exchange, having first joined its council in 1976.
Minchin started his working life as a high-flier - by joining the Fleet Air
Arm, part of the Royal Navy.
He spent eight years in the navy, including a period as naval attache in
Paris, but an eye injury put paid to his flying career, and galvanised his
entry into stockbroking.
He commenced his new life with Kitcat and Aitken in 1958. He joined another
stock exchange firm, Pidgeon de Smitt, leaving there in 1982 to help set up
market making in the Kuwait stock exchange, where he was appointed adviser
on securities regulation to the Kuwaiti government.
He joined Lloyds Merchant Bank in 1986, directing its newly created broking
subsidiary, of which he ultimately was chairman. He is also chairman of the
German Smaller Companies Investment Trust, and governor of Sir John Cass's
Foundation, the educational charity.
The SFA regulates members of all the organised City investment markets, with
more than 1,300 member firms which in turn employ some 38,000 staff.
Winckler earlier this year left the SFA to become head of supervision at the
Securities and Investment Board, the body responsible to the Treasury for
regulation of the UK's financial services industry.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Business and the Environment: Labour's green economic
yardstick
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Britain's Labour Party wins the next election, expect it to give a green
tinge to the country's national accounts.
In an environmental policy document published last week, the opposition
party attacked Britain's current method of measuring economic growth through
the gross domestic product: this failed to take account of the qualitative
aspects of growth. If there is a disaster, this actually increases GDP
because the money spent to remedy it is counted as production, while in
reality the country probably ends up the poorer.
Labour's policy document, launched by Chris Smith, its spokesman on
environmental affairs, promises a number of steps which it believes would
make the economy more responsive to the quality of the environment.
First, a Labour government would launch a nationwide consultation exercise
with the aim of reforming national accounting methods by 2000. Official
statistics would be placed under the control of an independent body to avoid
political manipulation.
Second, Labour will develop a reformed measure of national income which
would be published alongside the existing measures of gross domestic
product.
Third, it will develop a new range of indicators of National Economic
Welfare (conveniently called New) which will measure resource depletion,
pollution and a number of social indicators.
And fourth, at a local level, Labour will encourage councils to consult
residents to see what they most want public policy to achieve in the
environmental area.
The reformation of national income measures to incorporate green factors is
not a new idea. The present government is already committed to preparing
'environmentally adjusted national accounts' under the European Union's
fifth environmental action programme. But Labour aims to promote these
beyond the status of a parallel set of accounts to become the main indicator
of UK growth.
'The reason why GDP in its current flawed form is such a problem,' says
Smith's paper, 'is that it is so widely accepted and used by economists and
politicians as a totem pole around which all debate must dance. An
alternative system needs to gain the same high level of credibility if it is
to be useful.'
Setting itself a completion target of 2000 could be ambitious. The earliest
a Labour government is likely to be in power is 1996-97, which would leave
it only a few years to complete a mammoth task.
Just as difficult could be the New indicators. Some could be accurately
measured, such as the volume of oil extracted from the North Sea or the
amount of sulphur emitted to the atmosphere by power stations. But others
would have to be more subjective, such as the state of the country's forests
or the extent of biodiversity in Britain.
The local indicators need not be all that sophisticated. The document cites
the example of Seattle where residents were asked how they measured
environmental quality.  They answered: how many salmon there were in the
local rivers, and how often the mountains were not obscured by pollution.
In the area of business, Labour would require larger companies to report on
their environmental performance and strategy as part of a drive for greater
accountability.
Conspicuously lacking from Labour's programme, however, is any suggestion of
a carbon tax, which it views as regressive. It is also guarded on the
fashionable subject of switching taxation from labour to resources, so as to
encourage better resource use and boost jobs.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Business and the Environment: Troubled waters - Victoria
Griffith examines growing concerns about the ecological impact of fish
farming
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The depletion of fish stocks around the world is triggering a boom in the
fish farming industry, which pulls in Dollars 800m (Pounds 533m) a year in
the US. By 2025, fish production will have to surge by 70 per cent to
satisfy expected demand, according to estimates by the US Department of
Commerce. Most of that increase will be met by fish cultivation or
aquaculture.
But concerns about the ecological impact of fish farming are growing in step
with the industry. Originally embraced by environmentalists as a way to take
pressure off natural fish stocks, fish farming is coming under attack as
potentially harmful to the environment.
One of the criticisms levied at the industry is that cultivated species,
particularly in the US, are not species normally harvested in the wild.
'There is a lot of aquaculture for fish like catfish and trout whose stocks
are not generally harvested in the wild, and therefore are not under that
much pressure from over-fishing,' says David Harvey, aquaculture specialist
with the US Department of Agriculture. 'Fish that are in real trouble, like
cod, halibut and tuna, we're not yet very good at producing.'
Many threatened species, such as tuna, are difficult to cultivate because
they need a lot of room to move around. In other cases, fish farmers lack
information about what the fish like to eat, particularly in the larval
stage. 'For fish farming, you need higher survival rates than in the wild to
make it commercially viable,' says John Nickum, an ecologist with the Fish
and Wildlife Service in Washington. 'To do that, you need more information
about the fish than we generally have available.'
Ecologists have additional concerns. Many fish farms use cages in natural
ponds, lakes and the ocean and therefore interact with the natural
environment. 'With fish farming, you always get some genetic alteration,
even if it's just selection for docility, traits like that,' says Robert
Buchsbaum, coastal ecologist with the Massachusetts Audubon Society. 'Since
there is always some escape of larvae from cages, there is a concern that
they would disturb the ecological balance.'
Those concerns multiply when the fish are non-native species.
'You hear people say that certain exotic species are not a threat because
they could not survive by themselves in the wild,' says Buchsbaum. 'But
there is a limit to how well you can control genetics. One operation in the
north-west (of the US) says the exotic mussels they cultivate can grow, but
not breed, in the cold weather. But what happens if the mussels adapt, and
all of a sudden they can breed in the cold?'
Ecologists are also concerned about the surge in licences issued to fish
farmers to kill birds feasting on their stocks. 'For the bird, it just looks
like a free lunch,' says Randall Snodgrass, director of wildlife policy for
the National Audubon Society. 'But a lot of them get shot instead. Some of
those birds may be threatened or endangered species.'
Fish excrement and cast-off food can also cause problems. 'High-density fish
waste, the kind you get with salmon, can have a negative environmental
impact,' says James McVey, director of aquaculture at the National Sea Grant
College Programme. 'Any time you've got all those extra nutrients going into
the water environment - excrement, food bits that sink to the bottom - you
can cause a shift in the ecology of the area.'
Fish farmers say they are responding to environmental concerns. Sea Pride
Industries, a company operating in the Gulf of Mexico, says it minimises its
environmental impact by cultivating only native species such as red bass.
'As long as the fish are indigenous, there is not that much danger of
environmental harm,' says John Ericsson, the group's president.
Aquaculture advocates also stress that cultivation of endangered and
threatened species is increasing. 'With more research, we are starting to
have some success in cultivating shrimp, lobster and other species that are
under pressure in the wild,' says Hank Parker, aquaculture co-ordinator for
the US Department of Agriculture. 'This also makes good business sense,
since prices for these species rise as the natural stocks get depleted.'
Some fish farmers are moving to enclosed indoor tanks to prevent contact
with the natural ecological system. 'Environmental concerns are one of the
biggest constraints on industry growth right now,' says Joshua Goldman,
president of Aquafuture, a fish farming concern that cultivates marine
striped bass in an enclosed indoor tank. 'Through the tanks, we prevent any
possible threat to the natural environment.'
Despite the drawbacks, many ecologists see fish farming as a promising
solution to over-fishing. 'There is clearly a positive side to aquaculture,
in that it can discourage depletion of fish stocks,' says Buchsbaum. 'We
just want to make sure it is carried out in a sensible way.'

FT  27 JUL 94 / People: Salomon adds weight for European equities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Salomon Brothers has hired American Albert Richards, as part of its push
into the European equities business.
Richards, 33, joins from CS First Boston where he was director of European
sector research and European chemicals analyst.
He is due to start at Salomon in September as vice president and manager of
European equity research, and will be based in London.
Given his impressive list of academic achievements, which include a
doctorate in chemical engineering and a master's degree in management from
MIT by the age of 25, Richards clearly relishes the chance of putting all
his hard-earned theoretical experience into operation at Salomon's.
'The niche which investment banks can fill best in Europe is to provide
fundamental, long-term industry-oriented research,' says Richards.
His appointment comes just one month after news that Salomon Brothers was
sending Rodney Berens, a member of the firm's 12-strong executive committee,
to London as part of its drive to raise Salomon's profile in European equity
markets.
Salomon lost around half of its analysts in the wake of the US Treasury
scandal in 1991, but since then it has been steadily re-building its team.
It now has five sector analysts and six country strategists, though it is
looking for analysts to cover telecoms, media, capital goods and autos.
Berens is confident that Salomon's return to the European equities business
will be even more successful than its rehabilitation in the bond market,
where it is once again regarded as a powerhouse.
'In the long term I would like the equities side to be even more profitable
than bonds, but I will settle for a tie,' he says.

<TEXT>
Recession has blunted the growth in western Europe's Pounds 5.74bn
management consultancy market, which has expanded by just 7 per cent over
the past two years, according to a report* by Alpha Publications, an
independent research company.
It predicts that the pace of growth will increase by an average of 11 per
cent a year over the next six years, although this is well below the
expectations of a few years ago.
It attributes the lower growth projections to recession, a slowdown in the
growth in IT services and social legislation imposed by the European Union.
However, some trends are likely to expand the market, such as privatisation,
growth in international consulting projects stemming from increased
cross-border competition and new fashions such as business process
re-engineering, customer loyalty programmes and delayering.
The slowdown in Europe's economies has steered consultants away from long
strategy projects towards offering advice that gives a quick payback by
cutting costs or improving performance.
The recession has encouraged the restructuring of manufacturing companies,
making them currently the largest users of management consultancy,
accounting for 38 per cent of the total market, followed by private-sector
services such as banking and communications at 26 per cent.
The 30 largest consultants account for about 60 per cent of the total
market, down from two years ago when they accounted for 63 per cent. The
chief reason for this change is the increase in the number of small new
consulting operations, formed by executives made redundant in the recession.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Management: Trading places - John Willman on a scheme that
puts top civil servants on the board and executives to work in Whitehall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Could your business benefit from the presence of a senior civil servant at
board level as a non-executive director?
The idea might seem bizarre given the popular image of Whitehall as a home
for pen-pushers and faceless bureaucrats. But companies taking on top
mandarins find they make a valuable input, says Claire Arnold, managing
director of the Whitehall and Industry Group*, a charity set up 10 years ago
to improve understanding between business and the civil service.
'They have well-honed minds, used to challenging ministers,' she says. 'They
can often bring insights from their experience of government that contribute
to strategic thinking.'
WIG is a government-backed group, supported by 64 large companies, including
Midland Bank, Cadbury Schweppes, Shell UK Oil and British
Telecommunications. Each year, a dozen member companies find places for top
mandarins on their management committees or on the boards of subsidiaries.
For the civil servants involved, the appointments offer useful insight into
the world outside Whitehall.
Coats Viyella recently appointed Norman Glass, chief economist at the
environment department, to the board of CV Apparel, a Nottinghamshire-based
subsidiary supplying clothing to retailers such as Marks and Spencer.
Bill Shardlow, group personnel director, says he is always keen to encourage
diversity on the boards of subsidiary companies. 'Regulation is so important
to business these days, and a civil servant brings insights into the views
and thought-processes of Whitehall,' he says. 'The feedback is that Norman
is a lively and useful board member.'
Glass is finding the appointment equally rewarding. 'It is a fascinating
experience,' he says. 'The way the company is driven by precise financial
and other quantitative targets is so different from the civil service. Civil
servants set themselves targets, but are always conscious of the need to
respond to the immediate needs of our political masters.'
Glass has already helped the board find out what is going on concerning new
European Union restrictions on silk imports. And he has been able to provide
useful understanding of the advantages to the company of joining Investors
in People, a government-backed scheme for improving in-company training.
'I also find I have things to say as an economist, both about the economy as
a whole and on particular aspects of business strategy,' Glass says. 'The
contact with a business close to retailing is useful to me in getting a feel
for what is going on in the real economy.'
In addition to placing top mandarins as non-executive directors, WIG
arranges shorter business attachments for around 50 senior civil servants
each year. In most cases, they spend two or three weeks examining a
particular function of the company relevant to their civil service
responsibilities.
Nicky Oppenheimer, now principal establishments and finance officer at the
Lord Chancellor's department, spent her attachment in the personnel
department of the TSB, the retail bank. The TSB was restructuring at the
time, putting a lot of effort into communicating with staff and handling
redundancies sensitively.
'I learnt lessons that have proved helpful in the restructuring we are now
involved with in setting up the Courts Service agency,' she says.
'I found much in common between the department and the TSB,' she adds. 'Both
have a regional structure which creates difficulties in communicating
between regions and the centre.'
Oppenheimer also looked at the TSB's approach to staff appraisal, gaining
insights for a subsequent review of the department's appraisal system. And
she was impressed by the TSB's training programme: 'Their purpose-built
training centres with the most modern audio-visual techniques were an
eye-opener,' she says.
For Kevin McCoy, TSB's training director, Oppenheimer offered 'a fresh pair
of eyes' when looking at the restructuring process. 'At the time, we were
also developing our policies on equal opportunities, and she was able to
bring relevant civil service experience,' he adds.
WIG offers member companies the opportunity to learn more about how the
civil service works at first hand by arranging short attachments in
Whitehall for senior managers. This year it hopes to place around 30 top
executives in civil service departments and agencies.
Chris Bond, general manager of the export division of HP Bulmer, the cider
company, spent four weeks in late 1992 with the Department of Trade and
Industry examining licensing arrangements for industry. The project, a pilot
for the department's deregulation efforts, identified the licensing problems
encountered by small and new businesses. And it suggested ways of
simplifying procedures, including the possibility of issuing licences
through the new 'one-stop shops' offering small businesses access to DTI
support services.
Bond found the job interesting, rewarding and a useful introduction to the
processes of government. He also found the placement raised his
self-confidence by throwing him in at the deep end in an area where he had
no previous experience. 'It is a different way of working,' he says.
'Ministers tend to be much more remote from the detail than even the most
senior managers in business. The political aspects are also very important
considerations which you need to understand and bring out. Politics are part
of the game in industry, but nothing like so overtly or as such a priority.'
The benefits of this two-way traffic between Whitehall and business has led
to a 'sea-change' in member companies' attitudes to WIG, says Arnold.
'At first, they became involved in the programme because they believed it
would be in the interests of the country to help improve relations between
Whitehall and business. Increasingly they see the loan of a top civil
servant as an attractive option in its own right.'

FT  27 JUL 94 / Management: Trainers on the interactive battlefield - Tim
Dickson looks at forays into viewer participation by two video-based
training companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You've read the book and seen the video; now try the CD-i. That is the
current pitch from both Melrose Film Productions and Video Arts, two of the
best-known video-based training companies in the UK.
Both have re-issued 10 of their existing training film titles in the more
flexible and enhanced CD-i format.
The move represents a new opportunity for corporate, educational and
public-sector training managers, as well as marking the training industry's
first main skirmish on the multimedia battlefield.
Enthusiasts say that CD-i (which stands for compact disc interactive) offers
the same sort of advantages over ordinary VHS videotape that audio compact
discs (CDs) have enjoyed over traditional audio tape.
CD-i players deliver a better picture than a conventional video recorder,
while users of training films are able to 'hop' from episode to episode or
participate in a series of interactive exercises added to the original
scripts.
CD-i technology was pioneered by Philips three years ago but until recently
its main application has been in computer games. The breakthrough for
Melrose and Video Arts only came earlier this year with the development of a
cartridge that could, for the first time, deliver full-screen, full-motion
video pictures at a reasonable price.
CD-i is distinct from
interactive video technology, which was marketed in the 1980s. IV not only
suffered from poor picture quality but required users to invest up to Pounds
5,000 in a separate workstation.
In an effort to kick-start the new CD-i management training market, Melrose
has offered a free player, which attaches to a TV set, to customers who buy
either of the first two programs being reissued in CD-i form (Motivating The
Team and Keeping Customers Cool) before the end of July.
The Pounds 995 price tag compares with Pounds 870 for the Melrose videos in
their original linear form. The offer is identical to Video Arts': its new
CD-i range includes established hits such as Meetings, Bloody Meetings and
The Dreaded Appraisal.
According to Richard Roxburgh, Melrose chief executive: 'In a year or two we
think it (CD-i) will be as familiar in the workplace as the VHS video player
is now. It is like having your own personal trainer on disc, and it will be
enormously attractive as the
move to open learning gathers
pace.'
The Melrose products are designed to be used either as self-study tools
(with questions, a choice of answers and feedback), or by trainers who want
to stimulate discussion in a group.
The Video Arts titles, by contrast - also enhanced to drive home key
learning points and to encourage users to apply the issues to their own
organisation - are suitable only for groups.
'We see CD-i as an excellent means of just-in-time training,' says Video
Arts' Tina Tietjen. 'An important part of the re-design is that the
instructions are on the screen and you don't have to be a very expert
trainer to follow them. In these days of delayering, many training managers
have gone and the emphasis is on line managers themselves to make their
teams more effective.'
The big question mark is whether CD-i will triumph over CD-Rom technology,
which can now deliver the pictures and sound through a personal computer.
At the moment this is a more costly option but while the price is certain to
fall, Melrose's Roxburgh points out that the PC 'is only a one-to-one
experience'. He also believes that while the PC can be commonly found in the
home, the chances are that CD-i will soon be built into new compact disc
players.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Recruitment: Redundancy reigns in Metroland - Ageist
policies and the wasted talents of a generation of executives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The unemployed have become stuck with the stereotypical image of the
out-of-work northern man. He is either a miner or a docker, wears big boots,
a thick brown belt, corduroy trousers and a vest, and thumps the table every
time he makes a point.
He is as much a part of history as the Jarrow march, yet his image continues
to prevail, reinforced by persistent 'death of a community' newspaper
reports on the demise of the coal industry. It seems that not until the last
lump of coal has been hewn or the last rivet punched into the last ship's
hull will the caricature be laid to rest.
George Orwell's legacy has been a long time fading, but even though areas of
social deprivation still exist, the picture largely belongs to another time.
Today the road of social hardship no longer leads to Wigan Pier, but to
Swindon, High Wycombe and Welwyn Garden City.
The semi-detached home counties suburbia immortalised by John Betjeman in
his poems of Metroland has become the focus of 1990s unemployment. Beyond
the poplar-lined avenues and mock-Tudor facades and the neatly manicured
lawns of open-plan executive housing estates resides a groundswell of
resentment.
The extent of the anger in these Tory heartlands is crystallised in a sheaf
of letters that appeared on my desk this week. The letters were sent to an
Oxford-based recruitment magazine in response to its campaign on ageism in
the workplace.
Almost all were from people in the 40-55 age bracket with many years of
experience in their chosen fields. Typically they had a job in middle
management paying a good salary, say between Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 40,000,
with commitments and a life-style to match. Suddenly they found themselves
redundant; too old and too expensive for their organisations' needs.
All the letters make well-written, cogent points. One is from a woman, aged
over 45, an experienced export sales and marketing manager, fluent in three
European languages and caught, as she says, 'in the continuing
middle-management pruning'.
'How is it possible that the thousands of currently unemployed executives
and managers can be treated in such a manner?' she asks. She belongs to a
privately organised executive jobs club in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire.
It has 120 members, mostly aged over 45. 'The amount of experience, talent
and management ability being wasted is absolutely incredible,' she says.
She adds: 'Please do not think we do not try; that we do not send out
hundreds of finely honed CVs; that we do not know about networking,
cold-letters, agencies and all the other methods employed by those out of
work.' Job applications, she says, often get no replies or a tactful note
indicating that her date of birth is a problem.
'For the first time in my life, I have been forced to become conscious of my
age. What employers do not seem to comprehend is that someone who is 45 plus
is often more stable, secure, able to take decisions, willing to start early
and work late, does not take Mondays off or have small families to cope
with, unlike many 25 to 35-year-olds. So why is industry so blinkered?'
Another writer who, he says, has committed 'the cardinal sin of getting
old', recalls an interview session where on more than one occasion the
interviewer used the expression 'getting on a bit'. He and fellow job
seekers have become so accustomed to rejection letters that they now 'hold a
lottery as to what excuse will be in the standard three paragraphs'.
A 47-year-old High Wycombe man, made redundant after a company takeover five
years ago, says he has never signed on for unemployment benefit and, after a
series of part-time and temporary jobs has become 'resigned to never having
a 'proper job' again'.
It must be stressed that these are not unqualified people. One of the
letters begins: 'I am a chartered accountant, 55 years of age, with an
impressive track record of success and achievement in both private and
public limited companies as finance director and company secretary.'
Since becoming unemployed last March, for the third time and through no
fault of his own, he insists, he has written 'countless letters of
application without success, in many cases not getting even the courtesy of
an acknowledgement'. He also registered with a number of specialist
recruitment agencies, but was subsequently told by a company recruiter that
'virtually every recruitment agency will just push to one side any job
application and speculative CV if the age of the applicant is 50 or more',
unless the job calls for such a person.
The accountant writes: 'I truly believe that the majority of agencies and
employers think that the over 50s are in wheelchairs or on sticks, are
totally bald and toothless, and are too weak and frail even to lift a pen or
a key into a computer.'
He ends: 'I see little hope of John Major or any of his minions doing
anything that will help the mature job seeker. He has most certainly lost my
vote - for good.'
A letter from an engineer says he 'worked very hard through engineering
apprenticeship, engineering studentship and university to achieve Master of
Science and Chartered Engineer status and for the last two years I have been
jobless like many other people in my situation. I could have pretended I am
a self-employed consultant like many professionals do to hide the shame of
being unemployed.'
Behind many of these letters are cases of real hardship. A 50-year-old man
from Bath explains how he was made redundant in 1990 from a job that paid
more then Pounds 40,000 a year. His house was repossessed by the building
society and sold for less than his mortgage. He has four children and has
moved house four times in three years. He has experienced, he says, 'a total
inability to find a job paying any salary at all', yet has claimed no
assistance from the state 'due to desperate efforts to generate an income by
any self-employed means'.
He has, he says, sold insurance and encyclopaedias, driven a taxi, written
stories, worked as a holding manager in a problem public house, designed
promotional schemes for the catering trade, carried out sales training for
small businesses and done gardening work.
His is a pessimistic note. 'The discrimination is not going to stop or even
diminish' because society has fundamentally changed, he argues. Among the
changes, he says 'the corporate bodies we once gave our lives to working for
no longer have a social conscience, if indeed they ever had one'.
How is this man coping? He says: 'I survive. I look forward, not back. I
create a new, completely different lifestyle. I rely on my family and a few
close friends. I use all my energies chasing opportunities to make money
(not as much as before), rather than trying to find a job, although I still
do that as well.'
These letters reveal the hidden unemployment among the middle classes. They
reflect real despair among good, qualified, able, experienced people who
feel as if they have been dumped on the scrap-heap through, as one of them
put it, no fault of their own. All feel victims of age discrimination.
Perhaps this trend is a phenomenon of the 1990s, a combination of recession
and the revolution in working practices. Perhaps the pay expectations of the
managerial classes have outgrown demand. Whatever the case, these stories
reflect an unacceptable waste of talent, experience and enthusiasm.
Usually this column is devoted to ideas and trends in the recruitment
market, writing about how jobs are changing, different forms of work,
outplacement, pay, share options, boardroom compositions, a mixture of the
concrete and theory.
Sometimes, however, before you can consider solutions it helps to be aware
of the problem.

FT  27 JUL 94 / FT man to edit Independent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ian Hargreaves has been appointed the editor of The Independent in
succession to Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, one of the newspaper's founders.
Mr Hargreaves, 43, joined the Financial Times in 1976 and was most recently
the paper's deputy editor. He was head of news and current affairs at the
BBC between 1987 and 1991.
The announcement of his decision to take on one of the most difficult
challenges in British journalism - trying to revitalise the loss-making
title - ends two weeks of uncertainty. Mr Hargreaves, who will take over in
mid-August, said yesterday: 'The Independent is an important voice in the
diversity of the British media. It is important that it develops and
remains.'
Mr Hargreaves said he intended to continue the paper's tradition of
political non-alignment and to keep it firmly at the top end of the market.
He promised 'high quality and fair and balanced reporting' with 'strong
opinion and strong debate but non-party aligned'.
He intends to strengthen the editorial team at The Independent, partly
because a number of senior journalists have already left.
The board of Newspaper Publishing, the newspaper's holding company, meets
today to decide on pricing policy. A cut from the present 50p is certain,
with 40p and 45p the main options.
In spite of the price-cutting wars between The Times and The Daily
Telegraph, sales of The Independent have stabilised at around 270,000 a day.
During the past two weeks Mr Hargreaves has met representatives of the main
shareholders - Mr Tony O'Reilly's Irish Independent group, El Pas of Spain,
La Repubblica of Italy and Mirror Group Newspapers. He has received a
commitment from the board that none of its members can interfere
editorially. The commitment clearly includes Mr Whittam Smith, who will
remain chairman but on a part-time basis.
Mr Hargreaves says he has also received assurances from the main Independent
shareholders of their long-term commitment to the paper.
Mr Whittam Smith is the sole survivor of the trio who founded the paper in
1986. Mr Stephen Glover resigned over moves towards closer integration of
the daily and Sunday titles and Mr Matthew Symonds resigned this month.
Mr Andrew Gowers, FT foreign editor, succeeds Mr Hargreaves as deputy
editor. Mr David Walker, now managing editor, has been appointed to a new
post of executive editor and Mr Robin Pauley, currently deputy managing
editor, will become managing editor.

FT  27 JUL 94 / MoD rapped for 72% extra cost of Trident base
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The construction of Britain's Trident nuclear submarine base has cost Pounds
1.9bn, 72 per cent more in real terms than originally expected, says a
report published by the National Audit Office today.
The cost overrun on the 10-year programme of works at Faslane in Strathclyde
and nearby Coulport reflects changes in nuclear safety standards, and a
failure by the Ministry of Defence to define precise requirements in the
early stages, the public spending watchdog says.
The programme, one of the biggest construction exercises in Europe, was
largely completed last July - a year later than planned - while some
individual projects have been delayed for more than two years.
The NAO describes the Trident works as a 'considerable technical
achievement' which had to contend with changes in safety standards and
sometimes unco-ordinated instructions from the ministry.
One of the biggest overruns was in spending on consultancy, which ran to
Pounds 360m against an original projection of Pounds 78m. A giant shiplift,
as tall as an 11-storey building and as long as a football stadium, cost
nearly three times more than anticipated, at about Pounds 340m.
The watchdog found that in the MoD 'problems of co-ordination frequently
arose' because 'a large number of authorities had an interest in defining
the works requirement'. Only after 1991 was there a single point of
authority for project definition.
The project was managed for the defence ministry by the Property Services
Agency, the government's property management body, both before and after the
agency's privatisation in 1992.
The NAO says there were defects in the reporting arrangements between the
ministry and the agency, leading to a failure of control over design
changes. These problems were largely corrected after April 1992.
It was originally hoped that the base would be ready for sea trials of the
first Trident submarine in June 1992. This deadline was eventually
abandoned, but because of the initially strict timetable contracts were
entered without agreement on precise designs. As design changes became
necessary, and stricter safety standards were imposed, the contractors were
able to demand extra time and money.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Trying to bridge a narrow but deep gap: As the stakes in the
rail dispute rise, Robert Taylor sees signs of hope in both camps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The public exchange of views yesterday between Mr Robert Horton, Railtrack
chairman, and Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the RMT transport union,
looks like bringing about an early resumption of negotiations to resolve the
signalling dispute that has dragged on for seven weeks.
But whether it will lead to a settlement of an industrial conflict that
could worsen early next month and inflict serious damage on the economy is
another matter.
For some time both sides have seemed extremely close to an agreement, but
two sets of marathon negotiations at the conciliation service Acas have
failed to achieve a breakthrough.
It is not surprising that Dr Brian Mawhinney, the new transport secretary,
has found it hard to understand why the resolution of the dispute has proved
elusive.
On the face of it the gap between Railtrack and the RMT remains narrow, but
it has also turned out to be surprisingly deep.
Yesterday's statements by the two main protagonists provided further
tantalising evidence of this apparent deadlock while at the same time
hinting at possible ways out.
Mr Knapp reiterated that the dispute concerned 'a long-standing claim' that
signalling workers be 'compensated for past and continuing productivity at a
time when their pay has fallen behind other railway grades'.
He continued to insist that the RMT was offered 5.7 per cent on June 8 in
recognition of this and in return for a commitment to further negotiations
on productivity measures through restructuring.
Mr Knapp said: 'This was by no means a no-strings deal.' It involved the
RMT's acceptance of a range of new working practices for signalling grades.
'It is difficult to see how it could be construed as breaking government pay
guidelines,' he added.
The RMT insists that since Mr John MacGregor, the previous transport
secretary, vetoed the 5.7 per cent offer on June 9, Railtrack has failed to
address the RMT claim for rewards for past efficiency savings. The union
says that once the RMT claim is resolved, talks can start 'quickly' on an
overall restructuring package.
Mr Knapp said: 'At the last Acas talks both sides were close to an
understanding that restructuring should be negotiated through a joint
working party and I see that as a sensible way forward.'
The Railtrack chairman has taken some cautious hope from Mr Knapp's
carefully written statement. Mr Horton wrote back to the RMT leader that
'some progress' had been made at the abortive Acas talks on July 11 and 12
'by making it clear any settlement would have an element of early reward and
that would be a sound basis upon which a final restructuring package could
be secured'.
The company still believes its offer of a 2.5 per cent general increase plus
a 6 per cent unconsolidated increase in basic rates is worth 3.4 per cent on
earnings, and a Pounds 250 lump sum for every signal worker provides 'the
opportunity to break out of the present impasse'.
Railtrack also insists its offer on the table is open to further
negotiation.
Yesterday's signs of hope may well flicker out. But the stakes are rising.
On August 4 the RMT will announce the result of its strike ballot of 500
supervisors, who are being asked to join the signalling grades in the
industrial conflict.
If this produces a Yes vote they could join the action by August 11-12 and
could paralyse the network on strike days. It is a prospect that provides an
impetus for more negotiations.

FT  27 JUL 94 / A-level and nursery plans top Blair list: Labour outlines
'key' strategy for education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair yesterday put the extension of nursery education and the
replacement of the existing A-level examination with a broader qualification
at the centre of Labour's education strategy.
Presiding over the launch of the first policy document since his election as
leader, Mr Blair also emphasised the party's commitment to higher standards,
firm classroom discipline and greater parental involvement. But the tone of
his comments at a press conference to launch the policy statement, Opening
Doors to a Learning Society, contrasted with the document's apparent
concessions to the teaching unions.
The statement was approved by the party's National Executive Committee
before the leadership result and was warmly welcomed by the NUT, the largest
teaching union.
Mr Blair looked slightly uneasy when pressed about the party's attitude to
grant-maintained and grammar schools. He said that the funding of
grant-maintained schools would be brought back within the framework of local
democracy but suggested they would retain much of their independence.
Grammar schools would be discouraged but not necessarily abolished.
He also played down a proposal to scrap the present system of testing and
league tables to measure the performance of pupils and schools. Mr Blair
stressed the intention of providing more rather than less information.
The key planks of the document, which will be debated at Labour's autumn
conference, are:
A large-scale extension of nursery education to provide places for every
child aged three and four whose parents require it.
The replacement of A-levels with a broader General Certificate of Further
Education and the creation of a new national curriculum framework.
The abolition of the Funding Agency for Schools and the restoration of
grant-maintained schools to a 'local democratic framework'.
The establishment of a General Teaching Council to maintain professional
standards.
Replacement of the present arrangements for schools testing and league
tables with an assessment procedure to replace the government's
'over-burdensome and educationally flawed tests'.
Abolition of the Assisted Places Scheme which 'subsidises the independent
fee-paying sector at the expense of the public sector and denies equality of
opportunity'.
Mr Blair said the plans provided the foundation for recognition of education
as the 'key to personal fulfilment for the individual, to economic success
for the nation and to the creation of a more just and cohesive society'.
Colleagues expect him to make significant further changes before the next
election. Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, is widely expected to
be moved to another portfolio after the autumn shadow cabinet elections.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, reacted to the document by
attacking the 'credibility' gap between Mr Blair's rhetoric and the reality
of Labour policies.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Engineers urge more N-plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading engineering com-panies yesterday tried to steer the emphasis of the
government's nuclear review away from privatisation. They outlined a
strategy which some hope could lead to the UK opening a nuclear plant every
three years from 2002.
Lord Weir, chairman of Weir Group, who was helping to launch the British
Nuclear Industry Forum's submission to the government, said the most
important practical decision was when and on what basis Britain would build
more nuclear power plants.
Mr Roy Broadhead, chairman of Taylor Woodrow Civil Engineering, said the
privatisation of Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, the two generating
companies, was a matter between them and the government. 'What we are
talking about is industry's request that the government has a balanced
energy strategy,' he said.
Their remarks reflect concern among many of the 72 companies represented by
the forum that the two generating companies' decision to concentrate on
privatisation has diverted attention from plant construction.
Lord Weir said that the government had to ensure that nuclear power
maintained a presence in the electricity market. One possibility was
reserving a share of the market for nuclear power.
The forum says in its submission that, given a clear commitment to further
nuclear construction at home, British companies will be well placed to
exploit opportunities of a potential world nuclear market of Pounds 500bn.
The submission says: 'As things stand the nuclear industry is set to earn
Britain Pounds 1bn a year by 2000, but with the government's backing for
more power stations in Britain the export earnings could grow much larger.'
The nuclear industry provided direct and indirect employment for about
100,000 people, many highly skilled, working in companies at the heart of
manufacturing.
The forum pointed out yesterday that building a new nuclear power plant
every two to three years from 2002 would merely maintain capacity.
Lord Weir said the industry justified itself financially and economically
and added that, although nuclear power would need state support, this did
not necessarily mean subsidies. 'It will not be acceptable for the Treasury
simply to say that the requirements for financing Sizewell C are too complex
or too different to fit in with their normal way of handling such things,'
he said.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Legal position of receivers changed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The legal position of receivers over their liabilities to staff was
yesterday brought into line with that of administrators following the
controversial Paramount Airways case.
A High Court judge ruled - in a decision involving receivers for Leyland Daf
and Ferranti - that receivers have the same personal liability to employees
as administrators and are equally liable for holiday and severance pay and
other benefits in staff contracts.
In the Paramount case earlier this year the Court of Appeal ruled that
administrators were personally liable to employees in these areas.
Its ruling prompted protests from the insolvency profession, which warned
that administrators would have to approach their jobs in a radically
different way to avoid these liabilities and that this would threaten
thousands of jobs.
The House of Lords is due to hear the Paramount case in December.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Adams case goes to Euro court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two High Court judges yesterday referred the government ban on Mr Gerry
Adams, the Sinn Fein president, visiting mainland Britain to the European
Court of Justice.
European judges will be asked to lay down legal guidelines on the competing
interests of Mr Adams' right to move freely within the European Union,
including the UK, and the government's right under European law to take
action against him in the interests of national security.
A central issue is whether the exclusion order made last October under the
Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989 was
'disproportionate' when Mr Adams wanted to pay a brief visit to discuss the
political situation in Northern Ireland with MPs.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Pupil-teacher ratio rises again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pupil-teacher ratio in English schools has risen for the fifth year in
succession, John Willman writes.
Provisional figures released yesterday by the Department for Education show
that there were 18.1 pupils for each teacher in nursery, primary and
secondary schools in January, up from 17.8 a year earlier. In primary
schools, the pupil-teacher ratio rose from 22.4 to 22.7. The ratio increased
from 16.2 to 16.4 in secondary schools (excluding sixth-form colleges).
During the past year the number of school children has increased by 2 per
cent. The full-time equivalent number of teachers in such schools has risen
by just 0.3 per cent.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Rifkind hints at reprieve for Swans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The defence secretary yesterday rejected a call for the government to
provide a guaranteed two-year, Pounds 50m workload for Tyneside shipbuilder
Swan Hunter to save it from closure.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind told executives from Constructions Mecaniques de
Normandie, the sole prospective bidder for Swan Hunter as a going concern,
that work could not be directed to the yard and that all future contracts
must be won by competitive tender.
However, Mr Rifkind and Mr Roger Freeman, defence procurement minister, said
they would look at a proposal from the French-based company designed to keep
Swan Hunter in business while it competed for more work.
The CMN plan would require the Ministry of Defence to place the Pounds 6m,
three-month refit of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary tanker Olwen with Swans while
still in receivership.
It is understood that CMN has proposed to underwrite the Olwen contract. It
hopes that increasing the yard's dwindling workload will enable Swans to bid
for new work, especially a ministry ocean survey vessel worth about Pounds
45m, due to be ordered in January.
CMN still says it will only buy the shipbuilder, in receivership since May
1993, if the company has a two-year Pounds 50m base workload. Winning the
ocean survey vessel would satisfy this requirement.
Last week Swans heard that it had lost to Rosyth the refit of the landing
ship Sir Bedivere, but won the Olwen. The government said, however, that
Olwen would go to the next lowest bidder if Swans were not on a firm
financial footing by August 1. CMN hopes the ministry's response to its
proposal will be clear by Friday.
Last night receivers Price Waterhouse said it did not know what CMN's
proposal was, so could not comment.

FT  27 JUL 94 / CBI expects growth in manufacturing orders to continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Orders placed with manufacturers rose at the fastest rate for nearly six
years in the past quarter, as increased export demand boosted business
recovery, the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday.
Its latest quarterly survey of industrial trends predicts that this growth
will continue in coming months, although at a slightly slower rate.
The survey notes, however, that investment growth remains slow, and warns
that hints of inflationary pressures are emerging in industry, albeit from a
very low price level.
The CBI surveyed 1,151 companies about their performance in the past four
months and expectations for the next four months. It says that the
proportion of companies reporting an increase in orders, compared to those
reporting a fall, rose to a positive balance of 18 per cent in July.
This trend is expected to remain broadly stable in the next four months,
although output is expected to moderate slightly after surging in the past
four months.
The report suggests that this rise is spread across most sectors.
The aerospace and the food, tobacco and drink sectors reported relatively
weak performances.
Most engineering sectors reported a strong performance, with the proportion
of companies reporting an increase in output running at a positive balance
of 45 per cent for the mechanical engineering sector, and about 30 per cent
for the chemicals, metal products and electronics sectors.
Exports are providing a large boost to activity in most sectors, with a 19
per cent balance of companies expecting exports to rise in the next four
months, compared with 18 per cent in the April survey and 1 per cent in July
last year.
This rise is expected to boost employment, with the proportion of companies
reporting that they expect to increase staff in the next quarter, compared
to those which expect to shed it, at a negative balance of 11 per cent - the
least negative figure for almost five years.
The report highlights significant discrepancies between sectors, with
companies employing fewer than 500 people the main source of increased
employment.
These size differences affect unit costs and productivity. Overall, a
positive balance of 6 per cent of companies expect unit costs to rise.
Only companies employing fewer than 500 reported a rise in the past quarter,
and only companies employing fewer than 200 and manufacturers of
intermediate goods expect costs to rise sharply in the next quarter.
Companies employing more than 5,000 and those producing intermediate goods
expect the greatest increase in productivity in the next four months, not
least because they continue to reduce staff.
The survey notes that capacity utilisation has risen, with the proportion of
companies working below capacity running at 54 per cent last quarter - the
same proportion as in October 1990, just before the recession.
But only 19 per cent of companies say plant shortages will limit demand in
the next four months.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Financial advisers 'fail to meet need'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A stark mismatch between the type of financial advice consumers want and
what is provided by the financial services industry is set out today in a
report from the National Consumers Council.
A survey by MORI, which forms the basis of the report, found that almost
nine out of 10 consumers thought it was important that financial advice
should be independent, while more than half thought it was difficult to find
that sort of advice.
Only about one in five people thought the information provided about
financial services was clear and easy to understand, and more than half
thought such information was hard to understand.
Such a perceived lack of clarity could be behind the anomaly between those
saying independent advice is important and those who seek such advice.
While 88 per cent of those questioned thought it important, if not
essential, that advice was genuinely independent, more than 40 per cent
would go direct to an insurance company, rather than an independent
financial adviser, for information about general insurance or life
insurance.
Only when investing a big sum or choosing a personal pension were IFAs the
category of adviser most likely to be approached.
Both are aspects of financial services where more than a quarter of those
questioned did not feel very confident about making the right choice, in
contrast with other products, such as current accounts or motor insurance,
where consumers felt more confident about their decisions.
Lady Wilcox, who chairs the NCC, criticised the 'meaningless marketing
material' and 'high-pressure sales tactics' to which consumers could be
subjected, particularly as decisions made about life insurance or personal
pensions could have serious consequences later if choices were based on
misleading or incomplete information.
Lady Wilcox said it was vital for consumers to have access to full and
impartial information, and welcomed the establishment of the Personal
Investment Authority, the new watchdog to protect the private investor.
She added, however, that there should be an early review of how effective
the PIA was, and warned that consumer interests had to be strongly
represented.
The survey highlighted how consumers tended to approach banks and building
societies for different products, even though similar services might be
available from both.
Seventy seven per cent would be most likely to go to a bank for advice about
a bank current account, for example, while only 11 per cent would go to a
society. On mortgages, however, 42 per cent would go to a society, while
only 17 per cent would go to a bank.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Mortgage lenders warn of housing grant cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mortgage lenders yesterday warned ministers that cutting the proportion of
public money used to fund housing association projects could jeopardise
current private-sector involvement in this area.
This is the first time that the Council of Mortgage Lenders, which
represents banks, building societies and other centralised lenders, has
expressed a view about the grant rate for housing asso-ciations.
It reflects growing anxiety among lenders that the housing budget could
again be under pressure in this year's public spending discussions.
In recent years the government has expected housing associations to raise an
increasing proportion of private finance to construct or acquire homes for
social housing. Average grant rates have fallen from 75 per cent in 1991-92
to 67 per cent in 1993-94, and ministers have already signalled that they
want to see the headline grant rate fall to 55 per cent.
In a letter to Mr David Curry, housing minister, the council says that a
reduction below an average 60 per cent 'would be a major cause of concern',
and would leave lenders straining against the established prudential
guidelines which govern their involvement in the initiative.
Mr Andrew Longhurst, the council's chairman, says in the letter: 'There is a
delicate balance to retain between reducing the housing association grant
rate and ensuring the full participation of private lenders.'
Mr Adrian Coles, council director-general, said yesterday that although
further cuts in the grant rate would not end private finance in housing
associations, they would lead to changes in lenders' attitudes because of
the increased risks they would face.
Some would withdraw from the market, some would reduce their exposure or
insert tougher terms in their contracts, and others would consider raising
their interest rates.

The High Court action brought by 3,095 Lloyd's Names against Gooda Walker
syndicates ended yesterday.
Mr Justice Phillips reserved judgment. He is not expected to announce his
decision before September.
The Names suffered losses between 1988-90 as a result of a sequence of
disasters including the explosion of the Piper Alpha oil platform in 1988,
Hurricane Hugo in the US, the Exxon Valdez oil spill and the European storms
of early 1990. The Names are suing for the return of Pounds 629m.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Probe on bread price rebuffed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Office of Fair Trading has rebuffed pressure from MPs to launch a formal
inquiry into the price of bread in Northern Ireland, David Owen writes.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, told the Commons
Northern Ireland committee he had 'not yet been given a reason to believe'
that the price differential between the province and the rest of the UK was
'likely to be attributable to an abuse of a monopoly position or to some
particular anti-competitive practice'.
But in a letter to Sir James Kilfedder, committee chairman and Ulster
Popular Unionist MP for North Down, Sir Bryan said he had asked officials to
'make further inquiries bearing in mind my functions under competition
legislation'.
The recently established Commons committee wrote to the OFT earlier this
month to express its concern about the issue. The letter followed an
appearance before the committee by the General Consumer Council for Northern
Ireland.
According to the council, a large loaf costs on average up to 40 per cent
more in Ulster than in mainland Britain and the difference has increased
since 1989.
It says the bread market in the province is dominated by three bakeries.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Refinery blaze hits Texaco contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Texaco has told some of its bulk customers that it will be unable to meet
certain supply contracts because of the fire at its refinery at Milford
Haven in west Wales.
The company cited force majeure, or forces beyond its control.
The affected contracts are those for delivery in Pembrokeshire, the site of
the refinery. Texaco also said it would be unable to meet swap arrangements
where payment was due in Pembrokeshire.
Oil companies routinely swap refined products to avoid having to ship them
to distant locations. These swaps would enable Texaco to meet its
commitments in other parts of the country.
Texaco said last night that it could not reveal the amounts involved in the
affected contracts. But it stressed that deliveries to Texaco petrol
stations would not be affected.
Other companies have said that they do not expect the closure of the
refinery to have any noticeable effect on either supplies or petrol prices
because of a refining capacity surplus. But it was expected that Texaco
might lose some market share because of its inability to supply from
Pembrokeshire.
Officials from the Health and Safety Executive began their investigation of
the damaged refinery yesterday, after the last fires had been extinguished.
Texaco said it expected them to make a preliminary statement today.
The fire, thought to have been started by a lightning strike on Sunday,
raged for 36 hours. It forced the closure of the refinery, which accounts
for 10 per cent of the UK's refining capacity. There were no serious
injuries.

FT  27 JUL 94 / BT launches call screening device
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications is to make it possible from November for people
to identify a caller's number before answering the telephone, and for phones
to store the numbers of unanswered calls.
Under an agreement with Oftel, the telecoms regulator, callers will be able
to prevent the display of their number by dialling 141 before the number.
A permanent blocking facility will also be available, and BT is examining
the possibility of offering a service which automatically rejects calls
where the caller has prevented the display of his or her number.
BT will offer two separate services, each priced at between Pounds 4 and
Pounds 7 a quarter. Caller Display will allow users to see the number of the
person calling them before answering, provided the user has a special phone
or an additional display unit which will cost about Pounds 50 to buy or
Pounds 1.50 a month to rent.
The upgraded phones currently retail for about Pounds 90.
Users will also be able to recall the numbers of callers attempting to reach
them in their absence.
A second service, Call Return, will enable users without a special phone or
display unit to find out the number of the last person to call them by
dialling 1471.
Oftel said yesterday it wanted BT to provide facilities for competing phone
operators to offer the same services if requested.
'Unreasonable refusal by BT to agree these arrangements would be seen by
Oftel as a potential abuse of dominant position,' it said.
Negotiations are taking place between BT and competitors about an
inter-connection arrangement.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Halal meat row divides community: Alison Maitland reports on
an attempt to prevent abuses in the Moslem food trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Zahid Qureshi runs his halal meat shop in south-west London with
religious passion. He is disgusted at what he regards as widespread abuse of
the Islamic system of ritual slaughter. 'I'd rather have less meat to sell,
and fewer customers, but at least be selling genuine halal,' he declared.
Mr Qureshi, 27, is at the cutting edge of a new system to regulate the halal
meat trade introduced last week by the self-styled Moslem Parliament of
Great Britain. He said the Asian community in Tooting Bec, where he works,
was fed up with non-halal meat being routinely sold as halal.
He joined the certification system, even though it has pushed up the price
of his meat, to avoid being 'tarred with the same brush'.
'The response has been unbelievable,' he said. 'Many customers from other
shops have been coming to my shop and saying this is a fantastic system.
They're saying they prefer to pay extra to know the meat is halal.'
In halal slaughter, a Moslem must slit the animal's throat with one stroke
of a very sharp knife while the name of Allah is recited. The animal is then
completely bled. No other animal must be allowed to witness the slaughter.
The Halal Food Authority, which runs the system, has not met universal
approval from Britain's estimated 2.5m-strong Moslem community.
Some see its intervention as divisive because it is acting without the
blessing of all Moslem groups. Others in the meat business accuse the Moslem
Parliament, led by the pro-Iranian Mr Kalim Siddiqui, of trying to raise
money by cornering the market.
Yet Mr Ahmed Versi, editor of the monthly Moslem News, said: 'Some people
might not like the Moslem Parliament, but at least they've done something
for the community. Why has the rest of the Moslem leadership done nothing
about this problem?'
Mr Muhammad Ghayasuddin, chairman of the authority, said it was set up this
spring because more than 80 per cent of the meat being sold as halal was in
fact 'haram', or forbidden meat.
Much comes from poor quality carcasses picked up by traders for 'knockdown
prices'.
'What's happening as a result of this plentiful supply is that the genuine
halal trade is slowly contracting and is about to disappear,' he said.
Mr Ghayasuddin said the authority's inspectors would supervise slaughter in
abattoirs that join the scheme and would check warehouses, trucks and shops
at least once a day. The inspection scheme would be similar to that of the
Jewish kosher trade.
To pay for the inspectors, the authority is levying 8p a pound on red meat
and 15p per chicken sold by approved retailers.
Mr Ghayasuddin admitted the halal trade was resisting the scheme and the
bigger slaughterhouses had refused to join. 'A prolonged struggle between
the bulk of the trade that prefers its unregulated state and the HFA is
certain,' he said.
One halal abattoir manager, who did not want to be named, said the levies
were unnecessary and the trade was already regulated by local authorities.
While accepting that 'a certain amount of meat sold is not halal', he argued
there were enough Moslem-owned abattoirs in Britain to supply the
community's needs for genuine halal meat.
The authority's insistence on traditional ritual slaughter also worries vets
who supervise abattoirs. The Jewish and Moslem communities are exempt from
legislation requiring animals to be stunned before slaughter. But Mr Martin
Cooke, vice-president of the food hygiene division of the British Veterinary
Association, said most Moslem abattoirs have nevertheless been prepared to
accept pre-stunning.
Since the creation of the Halal Food Authority, however he said he knew of
one abattoir that had been told by local Moslem leaders to stop stunning
animals or risk losing its business. The abattoir management agreed, he
said, because 'they were being put in an impossible situation'.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Tecs criticised as skills shortage is forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Widespread criticism of work-related education and of emerging skills
shortages is contained in two surveys published today.
A number of businesses also criticised Training and Enterprise Councils,
which are responsible for improving skills, and Local Enterprise Companies,
their Scottish equivalents.
A survey of engineering companies with fewer than 500 employees, published
by the Engineering Council, shows a shortage of engineers at all levels -
managerial, professional, technical and craft.
Nearly half of respondents felt that staff had insufficient engineering
skills and nearly 60 per cent were experiencing problems in finding
appropriately skilled staff, particularly at the technical level. Moreover,
72 per cent said they expected to need more engineers in the future.
The council said: 'The unfilled demand for engineers by small and
medium-sized companies will be a problem for many years to come unless the
perceived mismatch between the skills required by small and medium-sized
companies and the education, training and experience available is addressed.
'Companies ideally would like to see more vocational education courses which
include engineering, business skills and practical experience.'
A second survey, the latest quarterly research by the UK 200 group of
practising chartered accountants, showed three out of four of their clients
forecast a skills shortage. They urged the government to establish further
forms of both vocational and skills training.
Some 40 per cent of respondents, said to be a representative sample of 1,000
businesses including manufacturers, engineering companies, retailers and
service businesses, said they did not believe Tecs and Lecs were effective.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Unionists demand speedier talks on Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ulster Unionist party moved yesterday to exploit criticism of Sinn
Fein's rejection of the Downing Street declaration by signalling its
willingness to resume round-table talks on Northern Ireland's future as soon
as next month.
In a statement released just ahead of a meeting between the Rev Ian Paisley,
leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, and Mr John Major, the UUP
 -the province's largest party - said bilateral talks between the parties
and the UK government should be speeded up.
In a move apparently designed to paint the DUP into a corner, the UUP said
there were 'hopeful signs' that 'all other parties' were prepared to
participate in talks 'with a view to joining in a four-party discussion in
August'.
There was no sign of a more emollient stance, however, in Mr Paisley's
comments when he emerged from his hour-long meeting with the prime minister.
Flanked by Mr Peter Robinson, DUP MP for East Belfast, Mr Paisley said the
party would not participate in talks held on the basis of last year's
Anglo-Irish declaration, which he described as 'a sop to the IRA'.
Presenting the prime minister with a detailed memorandum describing the
joint declaration as the 'foundation stone for . . . a constitutional
monstrosity', Mr Paisley called for immediate and decisive government action
to break the 'balance of terror' in Ulster.
He said Mr Major had 'made a fool of himself' by allowing himself to be
'strung along by thugs, murderers and liars'.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary - who also attended
yesterday's meeting - said it was 'very important' to urge Mr Paisley to
return to the talks process.
Sir Patrick said the government was 'patient' and wanted to 'find out from
Mr Paisley what he really has to fear in the joint declaration, and in
sitting down with the other parties and talking'.
Describing the tone of yesterday's meeting as 'sombre', Sir Patrick said he
was nevertheless encouraged because the DUP was 'moving ground' on the
question of why it would not join in talks.
Senior officials said later that Sir Patrick's comments did not mean the
government would wait for Mr Paisley before pressing on with political
talks.
They emphasised that no party had a veto on progress.
The UUP's suggestion that round-table negotiations could resume in August
was interpreted by some as a pre-emptive strike against the framework
document, under preparation by London and Dublin, which the two sides hope
to complete in the autumn.
This aims to cover relations between Ulster and Dublin and London and
Dublin, in addition to the province's internal politics.
The UUP has been pressing - with the support of some Tory backbenchers  -
for the government to concentrate on agreeing an outline for devolved
government in the province before moving on to the two other sets of
relationships.
Bilateral discussions will continue tomorrow with a meeting between UUP
representatives and Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Grandees on parade: Jurek Martin on first day of
congressional hearings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the first day of the Whitewater hearings in Congress produced only sound
and fury, even so it offered an absorbing public contrast between three men
 -Mr Henry Gonzalez, Mr Jim Leach and Mr Lloyd Cutler - all in their
respective ways Washington institutions.
Mr Gonzalez, 78-year-old, balding, Democratic chairman of the House banking
committee, is a cantankerous Texan, one of Washington's great manglers of
the English language, but a ferocious investigator of malfeasance in
financial institutions. Usually rumpled, yesterday he was dressed in an
immaculate white summer suit.
Mr Leach, 52, is a previously mild-mannered, moderate Republican from Iowa
who has made Whitewater his passion. He, too, was dressed for the occasion
in smart dark suit and tie; the old sweater and jacket that used to be the
trademark of this anglophile former Rhodes Scholar had been left in the
closet.
Mr Cutler, the white-haired 76-year-old White House legal counsel, is the
epitome of Washington superlawyers, an adviser to presidents beyond number,
opera buff and bon vivant. He wore his customary legal suit.
It was Mr Gonzalez, with the power of the gavel, who struck first.
He bluntly ruled out of order any questioning of witnesses on the
circumstances relating to the suicide last summer of Mr Vincent Foster, then
White House deputy legal counsel. A Republican demurred but the chairman
rammed through his edict by voice vote - all 31 Democrats concurring and all
19 Republicans opposing.
He then laid down the rest of the rules, as specified by the custom of his
committee and Congress and by agreement with Mr Robert Fiske, the
independent Whitewater counsel.
These were five minutes per committee member for questions, though time
could be yielded by one congressman to another; no straying from the
committee's brief to confine itself only to the 'Washington end' of the
affair; and any witness facing a question outside the remit would be told he
was under no obligation to reply.
He pronounced: 'As I have said repeatedly, ad nauseam, we're not here to
prosecute anybody.' Democratic heads nodded, as they did all day.
When Mr Leach's turn came, he naturally spoke at length - with an even
longer statement put into the record. He is a man who recently has tended to
blow hot and cold on Whitewater, hot on moral outrage but much cooler to
some of the wilder conspiracy charges bandied around by right-wing
Republicans.
Whitewater might not be Watergate, Mr Leach said, but, in partisan tones
matching those of the chairman, it was the product of 'one-party
government'. It was also 'about the arrogance of power' by a government 'run
by a new political class which takes short cuts to power with end runs round
the law'.
He complained bitterly about what had been proscribed from the committee's
hearings (all that was left was 'one third of five per cent' of Whitewater),
yet agreed that they should not come to resemble a trial.
Public ethics were not an 'incidental' matter but at the core of a
functioning democracy. 'In terms of symbolism, both of the disjunction of
private and public ethics and as a case study on how not to handle a
scandal, Whitewater takes on more significance. . . accountability is in
order but a constitutional crisis is not.'
Appropriately for a constitutional thinker, it then became Mr Cutler's day,
as first he methodically presented his written testimony and then, in the
afternoon, put to the sword ranks of frustrated Republican congressmen
complaining about cover-ups. This he managed with consummate finesse,
allowing no assertion and no fact to go unchallenged. He mixed the manner of
the law professor teaching a particularly dumb class of students ('it is
your committee which sets the rules, not I') with outrage that his own
honour should be questioned.
When Congressman Bill McCollum of Florida finished a diatribe (Whitewater
'stinks to high heaven'), the Cutler response was direct. 'I am not here as
a special pleader for the president of the United States. . . I didn't ask
for this job. I came in and took it and reported frankly to the best of my
ability as a lawyer and a person of integrity.'
When Congressman Toby Roth of Wisconsin made the most tenuous of comparisons
with the prosecution case against O J Simpson (the retired American football
star accused of double murder), Mr Cutler looked at him as if he were the
lowest form of life.
But he had no need to answer. In chipped Congressman Barney Frank, a
Democrat from Massachusetts: 'That is the least appropriate analogy I've
heard in my 14 years in Congress, even from the gentleman from Wisconsin.'
Then Lloyd Cutler smiled.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Washington tries to salvage crime bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The White House and a congressional committee are working feverishly to find
common ground on tough anti-crime legislation that has a high priority in
the Clinton administration.
The group of proposed laws, known as the crime bill, passed the Senate and
House in varying forms this spring. But disputes over racial implications of
the death penalty, and over an assault weapons ban, have kept the bill for
weeks in a House-Senate conference committee. It was to meet late yesterday
for what could be final negotiations.
If a bill acceptable to all of Congress is not released this week, no
enactment is likely this year.
President Bill Clinton met leaders of the powerful Congressional black
caucus yesterday morning to seek a compromise on a provision in the House
version of the bill that would let defendants use statistics to challenge
the death penalty - allowed in 37 states - as racially biased.
Senate Republicans have threatened a filibuster to kill any crime bill that
includes 'racial justice' provisions.
Also causing trouble for the bill is a ban on 19 brands of assault weapon.
The ban passed the House and Senate but is adamantly opposed by Mr Jack
Brooks, House chairman of the conference committee. Many gun control
advocates in Congress think the ban in the final version of the bill will
have the votes to pass and so they feel the committee should not try to
compromise with Mr Brooks.

FT  27 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Taiwan Gatt move puts Beijing on spot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Taiwan yesterday said it was prepared to join the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade with the status of a developed country in a move that will
increase pressure on China to bow to tough entry terms for Gatt membership.
The announcement, to the Gatt working party negotiating Taipei's membership,
comes three days before a meeting of the working party for China to discuss
the basic elements of China's accession protocol.
Beijing, which has been negotiating Gatt membership since 1987, has angrily
rejected Washington's insistence that as a leading exporter it should take
on the obligations of a developed country.
The Chinese government is anxious to rejoin Gatt, which it left in 1950
after the communist takeover in China, by the end of the year to qualify as
a founder member of the World Trade Organisation, Gatt's successor. However,
officials have said Beijing will not push for membership 'at any cost'.
China is seeking developing country status, entitling it to a lengthy
transition period to phase in market-opening commitments.
Beijing says it is preparing a 'final' trade liberalisation offer to put to
Gatt members. Intensive negotiations are expected in September - the
deadline for agreement on entry terms if China is to join before 1995.
Following pressure from Beijing, there is an understanding between Gatt
members that Taiwan will not be allowed to join the world trade body before
China does. Known in Gatt as Chinese Taipei, Taiwan began accession talks in
1992. These have made steady if not spectacular progress, while the Chinese
talks have been repeatedly delayed by rows with the US over trade and human
rights issues.
Trading partners reacted coolly yesterday to Taiwan's plea for exceptions to
the developed country rule, but agreed there had been significant recent
improvements in its offers to reduce barriers to foreign goods and services.
Taiwan said yesterday it would scrap all geographical import restrictions
and was ready to join Gatt's government procurement code. However, Taipei is
asking for special treatment for fish, rice and port taxes.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Daimler-Benz plans to invest DM250m (Dollars 159.2m) in commercial projects
in Vietnam, including vehicle production, over the next five years.
The German vehicles to aerospace industrial group expects to conclude by as
early as next month an agreement on the biggest single project - a DM70m
joint venture to produce 10,000 commercial vehicles and cars a year.
The company said yesterday it was in detailed negotiations with several
potential partners in the vehicles project, which would be based at a plant
near Ho Chi Minh City in south Vietnam. The plans provide for the plant to
go on stream at the end of next year, producing mainly light trucks and
minibuses but including annual output of around 1,000 cars.
Other projects disclosed so far within the DM250m investment are between
DM10m and DM15m in energy distribution systems by the group's AEG subsidiary
and DM25m for an exhibition centre in Hanoi by Daimler-Benz InterServices
its industrial services arm.
The Daimler-Benz venture is the latest of several Vietnamese projects put in
train by western vehicle makers keen to take part in Vietnam's accelerating
economic growth.
Renault has signed a letter of intent to begin car assembly with kits
supplied by Renault from France through Vietnam Motors, a joint venture
between Columbian Motors of the Philippines, which holds a 55 per cent
stake, Nichimen of Japan with a 15 per cent stake and a Vietnamese state
company.
Vietnam Motors already assembles some Mazda models and is to start assembly
of BMW's mid-sized 5 Series cars at its plant near Hanoi in September.
In May Mitsubishi Motors became the first Japanese carmaker to enter a joint
venture in Vietnam when it received approval from Hanoi to form a joint
vehicle manufacturing and sales venture with Proton, the Malaysian carmaker
in which it holds a minority stake, and Vietranscimex, a Vietnamese national
company.
The venture, Vina Star Motors, in which Mitsubishi Motors, Mitsubishi
Corporation and Proton will each hold stakes of 25 per cent, is to assemble
the Mitsubishi Delica minibus. Production is scheduled to start next March.
France is seeking to increase its trade with Asia to about 7 per cent of the
regional market, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said yesterday,
John Ridding adds from Paris.
Mr Alphandery, who was speaking in Singapore after visits to Vietnam and
Cambodia, said France must 'more than double' its market share in Asia. He
described French industry's trade with the region as 'far too small' and
said it must be brought in line with France's share of international trade,
which stands at seven per cent.
In Vietnam Mr Alphandery signed a financial agreement which provides FFr425m
(Dollars 79.3m) of preferential loans. The credit will be used to finance
work in water treatment, telecommunications, energy and health. He also
signed an agreement cancelling FFr1.2bn of debt and rescheduling another
FFr1bn.
In Cambodia, he he agreed on preferential credits worth about FFr64m. He
said Cambodia's debts to France would be discussed at the Paris club of
creditor nations.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Lloyd Cutler, the White House legal counsel, told Congress yesterday that
President Bill Clinton's close aides had breached no ethical standards
during discussions with government regulatory officials, in connection with
the savings and loan institution at the heart of the Whitewater affair.
He also asserted, in testimony to the House banking committee, that there
was no evidence that any regulatory agency had altered its approach as a
result of representations by White House officials. 'Nothing happened,' he
said bluntly.
'There were too many people involved in those discussions and some of those
discussions should not have occurred,' Mr Cutler said. It would have been
better if exchanges had been confined to legal counsel at the White House
and Treasury. Procedures were now in place to ensure this.
However, such was the media interest in Whitewater during last winter, it
was not unreasonable for those responsible for press relations at the White
House to try and find out exactly what was going on in the regulatory
agencies, he added, if only to prepare themselves to answer questions.
Mr Cutler's detailed testimony was given to the first congressional hearings
on the Whitewater affair, the complex tale of President and Mrs Clinton's
financial and land dealings in Arkansas in the 1970s and 1980s.
The counsel declined to criticise any individual, with the possible
exception, and then only by implication, of Mr Roger Altman, deputy
secretary of the Treasury, for having told a New York Times editor, before
informing the White House, that he would excuse himself from his savings and
loan regulatory duties. Mr Altman was then acting head of the Resolution
Trust Corporation, the federal agency formed to clear up the US savings and
loan mess of the 1980s.
Mr Cutler also addressed the question of Mr Clinton's own involvement in the
investigations of Madison Guaranty, the defunct Arkansas savings and loan
institution at the heart of the Whitewater affair. The president had
approached Mr Eugene Ludwig, comptroller of the currency, while both were at
a holiday retreat over the last New Year, and suggested a further talk.
Word got back to Mr Joel Klein, deputy White House legal counsel, who was
present at the same retreat. He promptly told the president it would be
better to seek advice from someone else. 'This brief encounter,' Mr Cutler
said, 'is hardly worth mentioning', though reports about it have appeared
recently in the media.

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The main leftist opposition party in Mexico has demanded a meticulous
investigation of a road accident that left its candidate for governor in the
southern state of Chiapas seriously injured, and three of his colleagues
dead.
Mr Amando Avendano, of the Party of Democratic Revolution (PRD), was
reported to be in a serious condition after his car had collided with a
lorry on Monday morning. He has a punctured lung, broken ribs and facial and
neck injuries, but was reported to be conscious.
Mr Avendano's wife said that she believed the crash had been planned and was
part of a campaign against the movement for peace in Chiapas. Mr Avendano,
an editor of a local newspaper in the town of San Cristobal de las Casas,
has been attacked by local ranchers and other landlords for his good
relations with the Zapatista rebels who began an insurrection in Chiapas on
January 1.
The PRD candidate was on his way to the state capital for a breakfast with
candidates from other parties. The lorry that hit his car was driven on the
wrong side of the road and had no number plate. Its driver fled soon
afterwards, apparently unharmed.
The state attorney-general, believing that the accident was caused by the
lorry being driven too fast around a corner, insisted that there was no
indication of the crash having been planned. However, he promised an
'honest, clear and transparent' investigation. The lorry driver has been
identified.
The crash has raised fears of further instability in the state of Chiapas,
before the Mexican presidential election and the state election on August
21. Zapatista rebels control a small part of the state and are planning to
hold a 'convention for democracy' early next month. The PRD has agreed to
send observers.

FT  27 JUL 94 / World Trade News: All systems go for Oresund fixed link -
Hugh Carnegy on tender preparations for the project joining Sweden and
Denmark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Work is accelerating on the tenders for the first fixed link between Sweden
and Denmark now that the Swedish government has at last given the go-ahead
to one of Europe's biggest infrastructure projects.
The Oresund Consortium, the joint Swedish-Danish group which is running the
project, has published a list of 14 pre-qualified construction consortia,
involving some 50 Scandinavian, European, US and Turkish companies. They
were picked from a list of 23 to qualify for bidding for the four main parts
of the 16km combined bridge-tunnel, road-rail link across the Oresund
channel dividing the cities of Copenhagen and Malmo.
After a delay of about a year, caused by a tortuous row within Sweden's
right-centre coalition over the environmental effects of the link, the first
tenders will go out in September, with the first construction work due to
begin next summer. If all goes according to the revised plan, the link
should open to traffic in the year 2000, a year later than intended when in
1991 the two governments signed their treaty to build the link.
Taken in tandem with the DKr20bn (Pounds 2.1bn) Storebaelt bridge-tunnel
link between the Danish islands of Zeeland and Funen, due to be completed
within the next three years, the Oresund link will for the first time
provide an unbroken land connection not just between Sweden and Denmark, but
also between Sweden and its main export markets in Germany and the rest of
Europe. The commercial benefits, especially for the Copenhagen-Malmo region,
with its 3.2m inhabitants, are expected to be considerable.
But stringent environmental specifications placed on the project,
principally by the Swedish authorities, have already forced the Oresund
consortium to make significant changes in the construction plans to ensure
the link will be, in the words of Mr Carl Bildt, the Swedish prime minister,
'the greenest bridge in the world'.
This will add DKr800m to the estimated DKr12.2bn the coast-to-coast tunnel
and bridges are projected to cost in 1990 prices. Associated land works on
both the Swedish and Danish sides will add DKr6bn.
The Oresund link is essentially a public sector project, although it will
receive no direct state funding. It is to be financed by borrowing on
international markets, backed by government guarantees. Payback is scheduled
to take 24 years from opening, based on annual revenues (in 1990 prices) of
DKr300m jointly from the Danish and Swedish state railway companies and
annual tariffs from a projected 3m vehicle crossings.
The chief environmental demand made by the Swedish side was that the bridge
section of the project, and the artificial islands it involves, would have
no net effect on the vital salt-water flows through the Oresund in and out
of the Baltic Sea. This so-called 'zero solution' is aimed at ensuring no
change in the oxygen content of the already badly polluted Baltic waters.
Second, the constructors must ensure that spillage from the extensive
dredging works does not exceed 5 per cent of the excavated material.
These conditions are 'very tough' says Mr Ingmar Bjornsson, project director
at the Oresund Consortium. 'But we have shown that it is possible through a
combination of methods. The restrictions will be monitored to make sure we
work within the limits set - and these conditions will be among the
evaluation criteria when we select the contractors.'
The environmental conditions entail four main changes: first, extensive
dredging will be done off the Danish coast to compensate for the hindrance
to water flows caused by the islands and bridge pillars.
Second, a planned artificial island 4km long will now be split into two
islands with a 600m bridge between them. Third, the tunnel - an immersed
concrete-section tunnel sunk in a sea-bed trench linking the Danish side to
the artificial islands - will be lengthened by 400m to 3,700m. Last, a
man-made peninsula on the Danish side will be narrowed by 200m.
The first tender dates - for the dredging/island building work and the
tunnel - will be set for December and next January, with contracts to be
signed in May. The tender dates for the 1.09km cable-stayed elevated bridge
and the 6.4km of bridges leading to the high bridge are set for March next
year.
After all the delays, Mr Bjornsson and his colleagues are anxious to get on
with the work. Not least because they are fed up with the hour-long journey
they must now make almost daily via ferry between Malmo and Copenhagen city
centres. Once the Oresund link is up and running, the trip will take 25
minutes.

FT  27 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Saudi refinery contracts run up against
delays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

The incomplete takeover of Petromin, the Saudia Arabian government's former
domestic crude refining and marketing agency, is adding to difficulties over
the supply and pricing of reduced crude and heavy fuel oil feedstock from
Saudi Aramco's Yanbu refinery.
It is also aggravating delays behind the formal award to Chiyoda Petrostar
of a Dollars 248m (Pounds 162m) turnkey contract to build the kingdom's
second - and much-needed - Lube refinery.
Chiyoda Petrostar is the Saudi affiliate of Japan's Chiyoda Corporation.
Industry sources say that Saudi Aramco has still not completed details of
its takeover of all Petromin's refining operations. Petromin, which was
absorbed into the Saudi Arabian Marketing and Refining Company (Samarec),
was itself taken over by Saudi Aramco in 1993.
'These problems are aggravating the already sensitive talks on the price of
feedstock and of return streams, the elements of unused base oil which would
be returned by Luberef to Saudi Aramco,' industry sources said.
The client, Petromin Lubricating Oil Refinery Company (Luberef), a 70/30
joint venture between Petromin and Mobil Corporation, had been expected to
award the contract last April.
Luberef already owns and operates one refinery producing 1.8m barrels a year
of base oil, which blenders, including Petrolube, another Saudi-Mobil joint
venture, break down to produce engine oils, anti-freeze, and transmission
and hydraulic fluids.
Domestic consumption of lubricants is now some 2.2m barrels a year, and the
kingdom, the world's largest exporter of crude oil, is now having to import
base oils. Domestic demand is rising at a rate of between 3 and 4 per cent a
year.
The new 2m barrel-a-year Lube refinery would cover growing domestic
consumption as well as enable Saudi Arabia to export base oils for the next
15 years.
Luberef's general manager, Mr Wolf Ziedler, said that there were still
arrangements to be finalised before the project could go ahead, including
pricing and supply of feedstock, dealings with contractors and with
government authorities.
The value of Degassed gas feedstock is calculated according to formulas of
market prices for crude plus processed oil by barrel and by tonne. Residual
problems from some Petromin operations add to the pricing difficulties.
Without future cashflow gurantees and a pricing formula showing evidence of
these satisfactory to the client, commercial banks would be reluctant to
finance the plant's construction.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and/or the Saudi Industrial
Development Fund could provide a portion of the funding. Equity finance from
the joint venture partners, plus commercial bank loans, would make up the
balance.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Washington tries to salvage crime bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The White House and Congress are working feverishly to salvage the crime
bill, which is stalled amid bitter disputes over race, the death penalty and
a proposed ban on assault weapons.
The proposed, multi-faceted law passed the Senate and House in varying forms
last spring but has been held up for weeks in a joint House-Senate
conference committee. After a week's postponement, the committee was due to
meet yesterday for what could be final negotiations.
If the committee does not this week release a bill which both chambers of
Congress can pass, it is unlikely to be enacted this year, dealing a big
blow to the Clinton administration.
President Bill Clinton met leaders of the influential congressional Black
Caucus yesterday to try to work out a compromise on a provision in the House
version that would allow defendants to use statistics to challenge the death
penalty as racially biased. Backers of the provision say the death penalty
is applied disproportionately to black people.
The Senate version of the bill does not contain this provision, and Senate
Republicans have threatened a filibuster to kill any crime bill that
includes 'racial justice' provisions.
The White House initially favoured the so-called Racial Justice Act but has
since retreated in the face of fierce Senate opposition, outraging the Black
Caucus, whose votes may be essential to passing the crime bill in the House.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Grandees on parade: Jurek Martin on first day of
congressional hearings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the first morning of the Whitewater hearings in Congress produced few
fireworks, it offered even so an absorbing public contrast between three men
 -Mr Henry Gonzalez, Mr Jim Leach and Mr Lloyd Cutler, all in their
respective ways Washington institutions.
Mr Gonzalez, 78-year-old, balding, Democratic chairman of the House banking
committee, is a cantankerous Texan, one of Washington's great manglers of
the English language, but a ferocious investigator of malfeasance in
financial institutions. Usually rumpled, yesterday he was dressed in an
immaculate white summer suit.
Mr Leach, 52, is a previously mild-mannered, moderate Republican from Iowa
who has made Whitewater his passion. He, too, was dressed for the occasion
in smart dark suit and tie; the old sweater and jacket that used to be the
trademark of this anglophile former Rhodes Scholar had been left in the
closet.
Mr Cutler, the white-haired 76-year-old White House legal counsel, is the
epitome of Washington superlawyers, an adviser to presidents beyond number,
opera buff and bon vivant.
He was dressed as usual, as if he were in court, exuding authority and calm.
It was Mr Gonzalez, with the power of the gavel, who struck first.
He bluntly ruled out of order any questioning of witnesses on the
circumstances relating to the suicide last summer of Mr Vincent Foster, then
White House deputy legal counsel. A Republican demurred but the chairman
rammed through his edict by voice vote - all 31 Democrats concurring and all
19 Republicans opposing.
He then laid down the rest of the rules, as specified by the custom of his
committee, the diktat of both the House and the bipartisan leadership of
Congress and by agreement with Mr Robert Fiske, the independent Whitewater
counsel.
These were five minutes per committee member for questions, though time
could be yielded by one congressman to another; no straying from the
committee's brief to confine itself only to the 'Washington end' of the
affair; and any witness facing a question outside the remit would be told he
was under no obligation to reply.
'As I have said repeatedly, ad nauseam, we're not here to prosecute
anybody,' he pronounced.
And just in case some poor soul had not received the message on the other
side of the aisle, he castigated Republicans for daring to leak to the press
material from Mr Fiske's investigations.
Mr Leach sat quietly through this, but his turn came. He spoke at length -
and it was but a fraction of a longer statement, with documentary materials
attached, submitted for the record. He is a man who recently has tended to
blow hot and cold on Whitewater, hot on moral outrage but much cooler to
some of the wilder conspiracy charges bandied around by right-wing
Republicans.
Whitewater might not be Watergate, Mr Leach said, but, in partisan tones
matching those of the chairman, it was the product of 'one-party
government'.
It was also 'about the arrogance of power' by a government 'run by a new
political class which takes short cuts to power with end runs round the
law.'
He complained bitterly about what had been proscribed from the committee's
hearings, yet agreed that they should not come to resemble a trial. Yet
there were unanswered questions about contacts and criminal referrals that
could not be ignored.
Public ethics were not an 'incidental' matter but at the core of a
functioning democracy. 'In terms of symbolism, both of the disjunction of
private and public ethics and as a case study on how not to handle a
scandal, Whitewater takes on more significance. . . accountability is in
order but a constitutional crisis is not.'
Mr Cutler would be very good if there were a such a crisis (he has over the
years made a number of proposals for improving the constitution) but on this
occasion his brief was calmly to present the facts as he had ascertained
them during the course of his review.
He offered the Whitewater hounds some already well chewed bones, speaking of
'meetings that should not have happened. . . subjects that should not have
been discussed,' but no raw meat. Whatever had been said by whom, to whom,
when and where did not result in any action by a regulatory agency connected
even remotely with Whitewater that could possibly be interpreted as helpful
to the president or anybody else.
With that, Chairman Gonzalez metaphorically banged the gavel again and
ordered all the committee off to hear King Hussein of Jordan and Prime
Minister Rabin of Israel address a joint session of Congress.

FT  27 JUL 94 / US consumer confidence remains high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US consumer confidence edged lower this month but remains close to a
four-year high, the New York Conference Board, the business information
group, said yesterday.
Separate figures on employment costs indicated little evidence of upward
pressure on wage inflation despite the robust economic recovery.
The board said its index of consumer confidence fell to 91.6 against 92.5 in
June. The decline was entirely accounted for by slightly less optimistic
expectations for future growth and jobs; consumers' assessment of current
economic conditions improved slightly.
The survey is based on a sample of 5,000 households.
Mr Fabian Linden, for the board, said the rise in the expectations component
of the index 'suggests a continuation of steady, moderate economic growth in
the second half of the year'. He noted encouraging shifts in buying
intentions: plans to purchase cars registered a solid gain after declines in
May and June; plans to buy homes were also up, although not to levels of
earlier this year. Consumers, however, said they were less likely to buy
household appliances.
The employment cost index - a broad measure of labour costs that includes
fringe benefits as well as wages and salaries - rose 0.9 per cent in the
three months ending in June, against 0.7 per cent in the previous quarter.
The annual increase for private industry workers was 3.4 per cent in June
against 3.3 per cent in March.
Wage and salary inflation has edged up slightly since the end of 1992 but
the impact on overall employment costs has been more than offset by a sharp
fall in inflation of benefits.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Cautious line on Japanese recovery hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The recovery of the Japanese economy is continuing, but could be knocked off
course, according to a report presented to the cabinet yesterday by the
government's Economic Planning Agency (EPA).
In a wide-ranging review of the country's longest recession since the second
world war, the EPA's economic survey of Japan argues that structural reforms
are needed to lift long-term economic prospects.
The report is highly circumspect about immediate prospects. While it points
to recent increases in consumer spending and falls in stock levels as
encouraging signs, it fails to endorse the optimism of the Bank of Japan,
which stated last week that the economy was headed for recovery.
'We hope that bright spots will spread through various sectors of the
economy and we think that is possible,' was as far as one official was
prepared to go.
This time last year the EPA argued that the economy had almost hit bottom,
only to see its forecast derailed by the sharp rise of the yen in the second
half of the year. Anxious not to repeat the error, the report this time says
the yen's further appreciation in the last few months again threatens the
recovery.
However, agency officials pointed to several factors likely to limit the
damage done by the high yen. The yen's rise has been smaller than last year
and has been principally against the dollar. The world economy is also much
stronger this year.
But the EPA is less optimistic about another threat to the recovery: the
weak state of corporate balance sheets. Debt-burdened companies are
reluctant to undertake big investment projects, and those that have done so
have found banks unenthusiastic about lending, given their own asset quality
problems.
The EPA also says 'disinflation' - defined as a low or negative rate of
inflation - has gone beyond the extent normally seen in a recession, as weak
demand was compounded by a strong currency and the growth of discounting.
Though falling prices were good news for consumers, they threatened profit
margins and led to a further deterioration of corporate balance sheets.
The report says the protracted recession has exposed a number of structural
weaknesses in the economy that had been masked by the rapid expansion during
the so-called bubble years. Companies need to review shibboleths such as
lifetime employment and seniority-based pay if they were to grow, the report
says.
The EPA also announced yesterday that a key economic activity index stayed
above the 'boom or bust' line for the third successive month in May. The
coincident indicator index stood at a preliminary figure of 60 per cent,
unchanged from April's figure.
The index comprises a basket of figures such as industrial production and
consumer demand.
However, agency officials warned that early indications for the June figure
suggested it would slip below 50 per cent.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Radicals try to shatter Mideast peace process: Israelis see
growing threat from Iran and extremist groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE and DAVID HOROVITZ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
It seems no coincidence that yesterday's bomb attack on the Israeli embassy
in London - and the blast early today in North Finchley - came soon after
Israel and Jordan signed an historic peace accord in Washington.
Despite the handshakes and near euphoria of Israeli and Jordanian leaders in
Washington, the Middle East remains explosive.
The peace process, far from subduing Islamic fundamentalism, has spurred
Moslem radicals on - for fear they will become marginalised.
They are aware this means striking not only at Israel but also at moderate
Arabs such as the leaders of Egypt, Jordan and the Palestine Liberation
Organisation.
As a result, the peace process remains fragile and largely dependent on the
political survival of such men as Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak, Jordan's
King Hussein and PLO chief Yassir Arafat.
Israeli officials believe the embassy bombing in London may be linked to
bomb attacks earlier this month in Buenos Aires and Panama. In the Argentine
city, a car bomb ripped apart a Jewish cultural centre and killed at least
96 people. In Panama, 21 people, mostly Jewish businessmen, died when their
small aircraft blew up on a local flight.
The Israelis claim the bombings were part of a well planned effort by Iran,
and the Islamic groups it supports, to avoid being isolated by an emerging
alliance in favour of Middle East peace.
Israel has long wanted to see a new alliance emerge in the Middle East to
oppose Iran and its export of fundamentalism. The Israelis have pursued
peace in the past two years partly because they fear that, by waiting, they
could face Islamic regimes less willing to compromise.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, yesterday warned against 'extreme
Islamic radical terrorist movements', with infrastructure throughout the
world, following the radical teaching of Ayatollah Khomeini, the late
Iranian religious leader. Mr Rabin described the threat as 'Khomeinism
without Khomeini'. Moderate Arab governments, Israel and western states were
all at risk, he claimed.
A detailed picture of how such extremist groups operate is lacking. But
Israeli security officials believe they draw on a considerable network of
contacts and cells abroad. They train at bases in Iran, Pakistan and the
south of Lebanon, a stronghold of the Iranian-backed Hizbollah (Party of
God), the Israelis claim. A Lebanese group called Ansar Allah, Followers of
God, claimed responsibility for the Argentinian blast.
Israeli officials also believe that, while many of the groups operate
independently, they are bound together by a religious philosophy that
opposes western decadence and seeks to establish Islamic republics
throughout the Moslem world.
The groups are opposed to the Middle East peace process and to moderate
secular Arab leaders. They want to see the state of Israel destroyed. They
draw support from students and professional groups, attracting young people
with the lure of martyrdom.
The Hamas Islamic Resistance Movement is one such group operating in the
Palestinian self-ruled areas and the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Israeli officials accuse Syria of continuing to allow extremists to operate
from Damascus. They claim President Hafez al-Assad could do much more to
halt Hizbollah and other Islamic groups. Israel says Mr Assad is pursuing a
two-track policy - using violence to force concessions in peace talks.
Israeli officials said the spate of bombings coincided with a renewed wave
of anti-Israeli activity by Hizbollah gunmen in south Lebanon. On Monday,
Hizbollah mounted a series of attacks on Israeli positions inside Israel's
security zone in south Lebanon, killing an Israeli officer and seriously
injuring another.
'It's all part of one connection in the struggle against Israel, compounded
by the desire to stop the peace process,' said Reserve General Shlomo Gazit,
former army intelligence chief.
Ten Palestinian groups opposed to the Israeli-PLO peace process are based in
Damascus, including Mr Ahmed Jibril's faction, which has threatened to
assassinate Mr Arafat.
Several of the groups yesterday condemned the Israeli-Jordanian accord as a
crime, marking a 'black day of mourning'. While these groups are responsible
for some violent attacks, they are divided between secularists and Islamists
and their alliance is regarded as short-term.
As the Middle East peace efforts continue, a battle against extremism is
likely to intensify.

FT  27 JUL 94 / World Bank laments its Tanzania role: Hans Georgeson and
Michael Holman on an internal study that admits to uncritical support for
Nyerere
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HANS GEORGESON and MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
World Bank loans exceeding Dollars 1bn to Tanzania over nearly three decades
following its independence helped sustain a 'poorly thought out socialist
experiment', according to a confidential internal report drawn up by the
agency.
The two-volume analysis of relations between the World Bank and Tanzania
between 1961 and 1987 is highly critical of the support for former President
Julius Nyerere's socialist programme, launched in 1967.
The report, obtained by the Financial Times, is still confidential,
according to World Bank officials yesterday, though they said this may be
reviewed in the light of the bank's new disclosure of information policy.
Mr Nyerere nationalised the country's industries, and some 14m peasants and
their families were compulsorily re-grouped in 'ujamaa', or collective,
villages in an effort to make water, health and education more accessible.
But the badly planned exercise disrupted agricultural production.
Since independence in 1961, the bank and other donors have provided more
than Dollars 15bn in aid. The largest single contributor has been the bank,
with loans to date totalling Dollars 2.1bn, while Sweden, Denmark and Norway
have together provided Dollars 3bn.
The hitherto unpublished report, although compiled in 1990, five years after
Mr Nyerere retired, throws new light on the donors' share of responsibility
for Tanzania's economic decline.
Many of the issues raised, including problems of aid co-ordination,
effective utilisation of assistance, and donor reluctance to disclose policy
failures, continue to characterise current efforts to tackle Africa's
development crisis. The document suggests that what it sees as Mr Nyerere's
well meaning but impractical socialist vision was indulged by senior bank
officials. Mr Robert McNamara, the former US defence secretary, was bank
president from 1968 to 1981, most of the period covered by the report.
The report criticises what it calls a 'stance of uncritical support for
government policies', adding: 'Even where risks were noted, the board (of
directors) consistently reiterated that it was the bank's role to be at the
forefront of social innovation and change, supporting new approaches to
development even at the risk of failure.
'The bank's practice of choosing to accept and not to influence the
development path led to considerable difficulty when the bank then sought to
restablish some influence in the 80s.'
The report adds: 'The bank accepted Tanzania's road to socialism enunciated
in 1967 as a fait accompli,' adding that 'since 1967 and at least until
1980,' the bank viewed Tanzania 'as coming close to being a model developing
country'.
But 'misgivings of successive missions concerning the effectiveness of the
planning mechanism, the workability of industrial policies and the viability
of an array of industrial projects initiated in the late 1960s and early
1970s did not evoke sober Bank reaction'.
Initial gains in literacy, primary school enrolment and life expectancy in
the post-independence era seemed to have validated Mr Nyerere's approach.
But by the mid-1970s several things were becoming clear: Tanzania was living
beyond its means; aid projects were seldom self-sustaining and donors were
having to maintain as well as fund projects such as roads; the
state-dominated industrial sector was increasingly inefficient; and
agricultural production was falling.
As the report points out, 'Tanzania's unprecendented access to concessionary
flows of external capital has allowed it. . . to maintain a high rate of
largely ill conceived and uneconomical industrial investment. The cushioning
effect of this access to funds, at least until the late 1970s, reduced the
government's receptivity to external advice for badly needed reforms in the
country's economic planning and management system, policy framework, and
institutional arrangements.
'It was not until 1981 that the bank acknowledged that the situation was
getting out of hand. . . This belated recognition. . . of the existence of a
chronically ailing economy casts doubt on the transparency of the bank's
decision making process.'
The report continues: 'No effort was made to dissuade the leadership from
embarking on ambitious industrialisation programmes when fundamental
preconditions for such an undertaking identified by the bank earlier were
lacking.
'The bank remained an apathetic observer and an impotent bystander of
unfolding developments as Tanzania became the testing ground for an
allegedly 'unique' socialist experiment and one that was poorly thought out
at that.'
None of the donors challenged the conventional wisdom, though by the
mid-1970s it was apparent Mr Nyerere's vision was turning out to be an
egalitarian folly.
The report highlights a problem still common among development agencies  -
government, multilateral and voluntary - in Africa today: reluctance to
speak frankly about recipient government shortcomings. 'The bank was not
prepared to question openly the underlying conflict between the ideological
intentions and what was realistically feasible', it comments.
'No attempt was made to communicate to the political leadership at the
highest level privately the true dimensions of the situation - at least not
until the late 1970s,' says the report.
By the mid-1980s Tanzania's honeymoon with the donors was ending and overall
aid levels have been falling over five years, reflecting recession in
developed economies, aid fatigue and dissatisfaction with Tanzania's
performance.
With Tanzanians' per capita incomes more than halved since 1980, the
government of President Ali Hassan Mwinyi is trying to redress the legacy
with mixed results. Institutionalised corruption, permeating the top
echelons of government, is threatening to undermine fragile macro-economic
stability. Western diplomats estimate up to 10 per cent of aid disappears in
this way.
Many donors are still cautious in their comments, but a Scandinavian
official acknowledges its aid programme 'supported Tanzania through a period
when, in retrospect, we probably shouldn't have'.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Three ex-premiers back plan to set up new party in Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Three former Japanese prime ministers have agreed in principle to try to
form a large centre-right party, a step towards the regrouping of Japan's
fragmented political opposition.
Mr Toshiki Kaifu, a pioneer of political reform who left the ruling Liberal
Democratic party last month; Mr Tsutomu Hata, leader of the Japan Renewal
party, the linchpin of the last coalition government; and Mr Morihiro
Hosokawa, head of the Japan New party, met this week for their first
discussion of joint policies.
Their lunchtime meeting, at a Tokyo hotel, is the fruit of four weeks of
behind-the-scenes preparation by party officials, led by the JRP's Mr Ichiro
Ozawa, the former coalition government's backroom strategist. Such senior
figures would only meet if officials had already come to an outline
agreement to join forces. Speaking in Washington, Mr Ozawa said he aimed to
form the new party, to be larger than the LDP, by September.
The partners agreed to Mr Kaifu's proposals that the new party should
support Japan's participation in the prevention of international disputes,
uphold the Japan-US security treaty as the staple of Asian regional
stability, and that it should promote UN controls on the arms trade. On
domestic policy, Mr Kaifu called for deregulation and reductions in Japan's
high consumer goods and land prices.
Broadly, the trio advocates a higher profile for Japan in international
affairs and more radical economic deregulation than the current
one-month-old conservative administration.
Mr Kaifu appears to have become the trio's informal figurehead. He was the
previous coalition government's candidate for prime minister, in a
parliamentary vote won late last month by the combined forces of the LDP and
Social Democratic party. Mr Kaifu was LDP prime minister for just over two
years until 1991, when he lost office because of his party's reservations
about his eagerness to reform the corrupt political system. In the event,
the first non-LDP government for 38 years, under Mr Hosokawa, achieved
parliamentary agreement on reform plans similar to Mr Kaifu's.
If the blueprint for the new party does turn into reality, it will confirm a
trend seen by many political observers for the present web of political
alliances to simplify into two or three groups. These would include the LDP
and the new centre-right party, similar to the US Republicans and Democrats,
plus a left-wing fringe.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the Japanese prime minister, faced mounting public
criticism yesterday over his government's decision to end a price freeze on
public sector services at the beginning of next year.
The move overturns a decision in May by the previous government of Mr
Tsutomu Hata to delay increases in public charges, ranging from telephone
bills to motorway tolls, for fear of harming economic recovery. The Liberal
Democratic party, then in opposition, strongly resisted such a move.
Apart from an adverse impact on the economy, the price rises have been
condemned as supporting multi-layered bureaucracy. Public service operators,
including the Japan Highway Public Corporation, have been accused of
creating numerous affiliating groups to accommodate retiring bureaucrats.
Mr Takeshi Nagano, president of the Nikkeiren employers' federation,
criticised yesterday's decision as a step back in Japan's move to reform its
politics and industry.
To reduce the mounting public ire, cabinet members attached conditions to
the price rises, including rationalisation and cost reduction programmes by
companies and public service organisations.
Meanwhile, workers' union groups, long supporters of the Social Democratic
party, revealed yesterday that they were ready to drop their endorsement if
the SDP goes into the next election together with the LDP.

FT  27 JUL 94 / World Bank laments its Tanzania role: Hans Georgeson and
Michael Holman on an internal study that admits to uncritical support for
Nyerere
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HANS GEORGESON and MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
World Bank loans to Tanzania helped sustain a 'poorly thought out socialist
experiment', according to an internal report drawn up by the agency.
The analysis of relations between the World Bank and Tanzania between 1961
and 1987 is highly critical of the support given to former President Julius
Nyerere's socialist programme which he launched in 1967.
Thirty years after independence, and some Dollars 16bn worth of aid later, a
country which once aspired to self reliance has become aid dependent, with
nearly 50 per cent of its recurrent and development budget funded by donors.
The largest single contributor has been the Bank, while Scandinavian
countries have been amongst the largest bilateral donors.
Although compiled in 1990, five years after Mr Nyerere retired, the
unpublished report raises far reaching questions about the donors' share of
responsibility for Tanzania's economic decline, as well as questions about
current efforts to tackle Africa's wider ranging development crisis.
Mr Nyerere nationalised the country's industries and some 14m peasants and
their families were compulsorily regrouped in 'ujaama' villages in an effort
to make water, health and education more accessible. But the badly planned
exercise, conducted by an authoritarian bureacracy, severely disrupted
agricultural production and contributed to soil erosion and deforestation.
By 1985 the country's deepening economic crisis forced the government to
adopt market driven reforms. Mr Nyerere retired the same year.
Today Tanzania, like most of Africa, has introduced an economic reform
programme backed and monitored by the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund.
The document suggests that Mr Nyerere's well meaning but impractical
socialist vision was indulged by senior Bank officials, notably Mr Robert
McNamara, Bank president from 1968 to 1981, although he is not mentioned by
name.
The report criticises what it calls a 'stance of uncritical support for
government policies' adding: 'Even where risks were noted, the board (of
directors) consistently reiterated that it was the Bank's role to be at the
forefront of social innovation and change, supporting new approaches to
development even at the risk of failure.'
'The Bank accepted Tanzania's road to socialism enunciated in 1967 as a fait
accompli', it says, adding that 'since 1967 and at least until 1980,' the
Bank viewed Tanzania 'as coming close to being a model developing country'.
But 'misgivings of successive missions concerning the effectiveness of the
planning mechanism, the workability of industrial policies and the viability
of an array of industrial projects initiated in the late 1960s and early
1970s did not evoke sober Bank reaction'.
Initial gains in literacy, primary school enrolment and life expectancy in
the post-independence era seemed to have validated Mr Nyerere's approach.
But by the mid-1970s several things were becoming clear: Tazania was living
beyond its means; aid projects were seldom self sustaining, and donors were
having to maintain as well as fund projects, such as roads; the
state-dominated industrial sector was increasingly inefficient; and
agricultural production was falling.
As a key passage in the report points out, 'Tanzania's unprecendented access
to concessionary flows of external capital has allowed it . . . to maintain
a high rate of largely ill-conceived and uneconomical industrial investment.
The cushioning effect of this access to funds, at least until the late
1970s, reduced the government's receptivity to external advice for badly
needed reforms in the country's economic planning and management system,
policy framework, and institutional arrangements.'
'It was not until 1981 that the Bank acknowledged that the situation was
getting out of hand. . . . This belated recognition . . . of the existence
of a chronically ailing economy casts doubt on the transparency of the
Bank's decision making process.'
The report continues: 'No effort was made to dissuade the leadership from
embarking on ambitious industrialisation programmes when fundamental
preconditions for such an undertaking identified by the Bank earlier were
lacking.
'The Bank remained an apathetic observer and an impotent bystander of
unfolding developments as Tanzania became the testing ground for an
allegedly 'unique' socialist experiment and one that was poorly thought out
at that.'
None of the donors challenged the conventional wisdom, though by the mid
1970s it was apparent that Mr Nyerere's vision was turning out to be an
egalitarian folly.
The report also highlights a problem still common among development agencies
 -government, multilateral and voluntary - in Africa today: a reluctance to
speak frankly about recipient government shortcomings.
'The Bank was not pre-pared to question openly the underlying conflict
between the ideological intentions and what was realistically feasible', it
comments.
'No attempt was made to communicate to the political leadership at the
highest level privately the true dimensions of the situation - at least not
until the late 1970s,' says the report.
By the mid-1980s Tanzania's honeymoon with the donors was ending and overall
aid levels have been falling over five years, reflecting a combination of
recession in the developed economies, aid fatigue and dissatisfaction with
Tanzania's performance.
With Tanzanians' per capita incomes more than halved since 1980, the
government of President Ali Hassan Mwinyi is trying to redress the legacy
with mixed results. Increasingly institutionalised corruption, permeating
the very top echelons of government, is threatening to undermine fragile
macro-economic stability. Western diplomats estimate that up to 10 per cent
of the aid disappears in this way.
Many donors are still cautious in their public comments, though a
Scandanavian foreign ministry official acknowledges that its aid programme
'supported Tanzania through a period when, in retrospect, we probably
shouldn't have'.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Storm of protest over Jerusalem clauses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel's latest manoeuvres on Jerusalem, the most sensitive issue in
Arab-Israeli peace talks, has ignited a storm of Palestinian and Arab
protest against the historic Israeli-Jordanian peace declaration signed in
Washington.
Palestinians attacked the agreement's recognition of King Hussein's special
role over Jerusalem, which they see as their future capital, reflecting a
decades-long rivalry between King Hussein and Mr Yassir Arafat, the chairman
of the Palestine Liberation Organisation. King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, who
also lays claim to special jurisdictional rights over the holy city is also
likely to have been angered by the accord.
The declaration says Israel respects Jordan's 'present special role' in
administering Moslem holy shrines in Jerusalem including the 1,300 year-old
Dome of the Rock and the Al Aqsa mosque on the Temple Mount, Islam's third
holiest site after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia. The agreement also
grants King Hussein, a direct descendant of the prophet Mohammed, a 'high
priority' in future negotiations over the permanent status of the disputed
city, expected to begin in 1995 or 1996.
Angry Palestinians said Israel was attempting to de-politicise the issue of
Jerusalem by turning it into a religious matter and had no right as an
occupying power to cede any Palestinian rights to Jordan. The Palestinians
want Israeli-occupied Arab East Jerusalem, including the old city, to become
their capital. Israel however sees all Jerusalem as its 'eternal and
non-divisible capital'.
The PLO said yesterday the agreement 'predetermines the fate of Jerusalem
and limits it only to a role in the Islamic holy places and ignores
Jerusalem as a political, Palestinian, Arab, Christian and Islamic issue and
ignores the fact that it is an occupied city.'
Since Israel captured the old city and the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967
Arab-Israeli War King Hussein has continued to act as custodian of
Jerusalem's Islamic sites and has paid for their upkeep. Last year the King
paid Dollars 8m for the restoration of the golden cupola of the octagonal
Dome of the Rock.
The King's strategy has been to safeguard his family's role and block any
competing claims from the Arab world. Israel is much happier with the King
having a religious role over Jerusalem than with the PLO's political claims
and has consistently denied PLO officials the right to visit Jerusalem or
establish any institutions in the city.
Last week Mr Arafat attacked Israel's invitation of King Hussein, who has
often been at loggerheads with the PLO chairman, to pray at the Al Aqsa
mosque.
Islamic fundamentalists in Gaza in a rare display of unity with the PLO also
attacked the agreement.

FT  27 JUL 94 / HK backs away from bank reforms
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Hong Kong government has drawn back from comprehensive reform of the
colony's banking system and has passed to its successor government in 1997
the issue of interest rate deregulation.
In February Hong Kong's Consumer Council called for the phased deregulation
of interest rates governing small deposits, and for far greater disclosure
of the true nature of bank profitability. The council said the banks reaped
monopoly profits from an interest rate cartel, and that bank secrecy no
longer served any purpose.
In the government's reply yesterday, however, Mr Michael Cartland, secretary
for financial services, said the administration had to strike a balance
between competition in banking services and the need to maintain stability
in the colony's monetary and banking systems. He said he also doubted if
small depositors would benefit from deregulated interest rates.
The government's cautious response to liberalisation underlined its concern
about the possibility of financial instability in the run up to Hong Kong's
change in sovereignty in 1997. It was a large, if expected, victory for the
banks which had argued vigorously against any change to the status quo.
In a concession to the consumer lobby, however, Mr Cartland said that
restrictions on the rates of interest governing time deposits could be
lifted in 1995. These interest rates cover about 4 per cent of the Hong Kong
dollar deposits.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Brother of Berlusconi 'provided bribe cash'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paolo Berlusconi, the younger brother of the Italian prime minister,
provided money to pay bribes to the Guardia di Finanza, the financial
police, on behalf of Fininvest, the Berlusconi family's media empire,
according to lawyers acting for a senior Fininvest executive.
This new twist to the problems of Fininvest and its proprietor, Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, came after Mr Salvatore Sciascia, head of the group's tax
department, had been interrogated by Milan magistrates on charges of
corruption.
In comments reported yesterday by Ansa, the national news agency, Mr Guido
Viola, Mr Sciascia's lawyer, said bribes paid by his client to the Guardia
di Finanza had been provided and approved by Mr Paolo Berlusconi.
Mr Sciascia was one of two people handling Fininvest's tax affairs who were
issued with arrest warrants last Saturday. On Monday Mr Sciascia admitted
paying a total of L330m (Pounds 137,000) to members of the financial police
to cover inspections of three Fininvest subsidiaries between 1989 and 1992.
It was not clear whether the money paid out had been accounted for in
Fininvest's balance sheets.
Mr Paolo Berlusconi, whose lawyers last night made a surprise visit to the
Milan magistrates, was a board member of Fininvest, while his brother
Silvio, the founder of the group, was chairman - a post he surrendered when
he entered politics in January.
Yesterday, police searched Mr Sciascia's offices and also issued an arrest
warrant for a third member of Fininvest's tax department. So far only Mr
Sciascia has handed himself in.
Among the aspects of Fininvest Milan magistrates are now reportedly
investigating is the ownership structure of Telepui, the pay-TV channel. Mr
Berlusconi was only permitted a minority stake in Telepui because of
anti-trust laws.
The damage to the government's credibility by the investigations into
Fininvest caused shares on the Milan bourse to fall by almost 3 per cent
yesterday and the lira remained weak.
The prime minister himself yesterday struggled to recoup some of his lost
authority with a defiant speech to a congress of the Christian Democratic
Centre, minor partners in his right-wing coalition. He criticised the
judiciary for exceeding their powers and, in a clear reference to the Milan
magistrates, challenged those who sought to take political positions to seek
a popular mandate at the polls.

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Greece's current account deficit fell sharply in the first four months
mainly thanks to increased transfers from the European Union structural
funds. The January-April deficit totalled Dollars 91m (Pounds 60m), against
Dollars 654m for the same period last year, according to central bank
figures. However, the underlying trade deficit worsened as exports fell by
12 per cent to Dollars 1.56bn, maintaining last year's steady downward
trend, while imports rose by 2.3 per cent to Dollars 5.88bn. The 32 per cent
rise in EU transfers, totalling Dollars 2.4bn, was due to much-increased
funding for infrastructure improvements, which is due to continue over the
next four years. At the same time, income from shipping and remittances from
Greeks working abroad declined by 6.5 and 1.3 per cent respectively, while
earnings from tourism rose by just 2.3 per cent for the first four months
this year.
Consumer prices in the west German state of Hesse rose 0.1 per cent in the
month to mid-July for a year-on-year increase of 3 per cent, the state
statistics office said. Baden-Wurttemberg reported consumer prices flat in
July compared with June and up 3 per cent from a year earlier. The figures
for North Rhine-Westphalia were 0.1 per cent and 2.7 per cent.
Ukraine's industrial output fell 36 per cent in the first six months
compared to the same period last year, but the downward trend has slowed
since May, the statistics ministry said.

Greece's public works minister, Mr Costas Geitonas, yesterday presented to
parliament new legislation reforming tender procedures for road and port
construction. The proposed law aims at defusing a dispute with the European
Commission that could delay disbursement of more than Dr250bn (Dollars
1.1bn) in European Union aid to Greece for infrastructure improvements, due
to be transferred later this year. The public works ministry has already
postponed tenders worth more than Dr100bn because of the Commission's
objections to the way bidding is carried out. Several Greek contractors
recently offered discounts of up to 80 per cent on EU-backed motorway and
harbour projects, with the aim of recouping costs later by renegotiating the
contract terms. The new law calls for tighter conditions on tendering,
including examinations of companies' recent financial results, and stiff
fines for contractors who fail to meet project deadlines.

Astra, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, yesterday welcomed an EU committee
verdict endorsing the safety of its top-selling anti-ulcer drug, Losec. The
committee was responding to German health authority concerns that injected
versions of Losec could cause blindness. The committee for proprietary
medicinal products concluded there was no causal link between the
intravenous use of Losec and the reported side-effects experienced by some
critically ill users. There was no case for recommending restrictions on the
drug's use, it added. Astra has agreed to revise its information to doctors
accordingly. Losec is one of the world's fastest growing medicines, with
1993 total sales worth SKr12.7bn (Pounds 1.06bn). Intravenous versions of
the drug account for just 3 per cent of sales as it is usually taken orally.
The group's A shares, which have been overshadowed by the German claims in
recent months, rose SKr3 to SKr170.

The Bosnian Serbs, in a clear warning to the west not to impose punitive
measures for their refusal to sign a peace agreement, have said they will
reimpose their blockade on civilian traffic in and out of Sarajevo from
today. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, told the United Nations
in Sarajevo that its convoys would be the only traffic allowed in and out of
the Bosnian capital. The Serb threat could mean the virtual reimposition of
the siege of the capital which ended with a truce in February. It is also a
pointed reminder to the west of how rapidly the situation in Bosnia as a
whole could deteriorate if the Serbs reverse the concessions they made
earlier this year. A meeting in Geneva this weekend of the five foreign
ministers involved in designing a peace plan for Bosnia is expected to hear
calls, particularly from the US, for tougher action against the Serbs.
However, in another serious challenge to western policy in Bosnia, General
Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, said in Belgrade that he did
not want to see Nato playing a greater role in former Yugoslavia.

A new decree allowing Russian privatisation to continue gives companies the
right to own the land on which they stand. Mr Dmitry Vasiliev, deputy
privatisation minister, said yesterday this would enable companies to sell
surplus land, or use it to raise cash to restructure and modernise. The
decree, a substitute for legislation blocked by parliament, drops original
provisions for much broader land privatisation (which is to be covered by
separate legislation if approved by parliament). It also gives local
authorities the right to set the price, above a government-established
minimum threshold, at which shares in privatised companies can be sold to
the public. Employees will continue to be able buy shares at a discount, and
the final decision-making on the sale of the biggest companies is switched
from the privatisation ministry to President Boris Yeltsin's office. In
practice, this means that local authorities will be able to negotiate their
fate directly with presidential officials - behind closed doors. According
to a senior official, 103,000 out of 140,000 state-owned companies were sold
in the first stage of privatisation for vouchers given free of charge to
every citizen.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The presidents of Russia and Estonia yesterday signed an agreement under
which the remaining 2,000 Russian troops in Estonia will leave by August 31.
A brief statement to the official news agency Tass said that 'the presidents
of Russia and Estonia signed an agreement today that the rights of the
Russian military pensioners would be respected equally to the rights of
Estonian citizens. They also signed an agreement in accordance with which
Russian troops are withdrawn from Estonia before August 31'. President Boris
Yeltsin, emerging after six hours of talks with his Estonian opposite
number, Mr Lennart Meri, commented that the negotiations were 'pretty hard'.
The formula appears to mean that the Estonian side will pay pensions and
offer the rights of citizenship to those among 10,000 Russian officers who
have reached retirement age, but not to those among them in their thirties
and forties whom the Estonians believe are present or former secret
policemen who have been actively engaged in espionage and other anti-state
activities.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Water gets political in a very dry Spain: Access is dividing
regions - and the troubled Socialists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Water will begin trickling today via a network of canals and aqueducts, from
the nearly empty reservoirs fed by the Tajo river in central Spain to the
almost dry ones served by the Segura river more than 300kms south east.
After one of the longest low rainfall decades on record, the transfer of
water from the baked steppes of the Spanish plain to the parched orchards on
the Mediterranean has sparked a bitter debate, nowhere more so than inside
the ruling Socialist party, which controls the two regions fighting for the
water.
The row centres on the irrigation potential, or lack of it, of the
Tajo-Segura trasvase a series of canals and tunnels that links the
1,082km-long Tajo, which enters the Atlantic, as the Tagus, at Lisbon, with
the 325km-long Segura, which flows into the Mediterranean south of Alicante.
The issue is how water should be managed in a mainly dry country. As
consumption has risen with expanding urban populations and enlarged
agricultural areas under irrigation, water has become increasingly scarce -
and political.
People in the Segura basin, one of Spain's richest fruit growing regions,
are so low on water they have warned they might have to uproot their parched
trees. The only way to get water to them is from the Tajo, where people say
they do not have enough to drink.
Mr Jose Borrell, the public works minister who at the weekend ordered the
sluice gates on the Tajo's Buenda-Entrepenas reservoir open to start filling
the canal network, says he had to make the sort of decision that would have
'baffled King Solomon'.
In the event he persuaded the government to agree to the transfer of 55,000
cu m of water from Buenda-Entrepenas draining this once huge inland sea
among the valleys of the Montes Universales sierra near Madrid, from an
already critical 14 per cent capacity to just 7 per cent. The fruit farmers
to the south had wanted an emergency supply of at least 60,000 cu m to save
their cash crops.
The released water flow, which has taken more than three days to reach the
Segura reservoirs, will only be available for irrigating the main orchards
in the Alicante region on August 6. Some 7,000 cu m of the Tajo's inflow
will have been lost by that time through evaporation and, when at last it
reaches the table grape producing vines and the almond, orange, lemon and
pommegranate trees in the area, will provide only about two weeks' worth of
irrigation.
This limited water injection will save some of the crops, spread over
50,000ha, that over the years had built up strong export markets in the EU.
About half the area has received no irrigation at all this year, some
12m-15m trees will bear no fruit and losses are estimated to be Pta25bn
(Pounds 125m).
None of that moved Mr Jose Bono, premier of the Castille-La Mancha region
which includes the Tajo and the depleted Buendia reservior.
'Not a drop must leave the Tajo,' he insisted and, as one of the closest of
prime minister Felipe Gonzalez's Socialist party allies, managed to delay
the opening of the Buenda sluice gates for weeks.
Mr Bono claims there are some 100 villages in the vicinity of the reservoir
suffering water shortages and that more than 70,000ha theoretically
earmarked for irrigation by the Tajo in Castilla-La Mancha have never
produced a crop because the Buenda-Entrepenas has never held enough to
permit the area's cultivation.
But the pressure from Mr Joan Lerma, premier of the Valencia region, which
includes the Alicante orchards, proved more powerful and bent the
government's ear. He says whatever Castille-La Mancha might produce by way
of future crops, the existing cultivation in his region is threatened and
that billions of pesetas and thousands of jobs are at stake.
The two regional socialist leaders have openly attacked each other in the
media and their outbursts have succeeded in further embarrassing a
government already at pains to soothe over differences between the party's
left wing and its moderates. Last week Mr Lerma encouraged Alicante fruit
farmers to demonstrate in Madrid and this week Mr Bono is expected to
support a similar march on the capital by thirsty villagers from the Tajo's
river banks.
The row has at least had the virtue of focusing minds on a National
Hydrology Plan, dealing with water resource management and with a
provisional budget - spread over 20 years, of Pta3,500bn - that is now in
its final blueprint stage before Mr Borrell presents it to parliament later
this year.
The plan includes the construction of as many as 200 dams which will serve
to bring water south from Spain's northern wetlands, and chiefly from the
Douro and Ebro river basins, to the Tajo's reservoirs and on to areas such
as Alicante's orchards.
According to Mr Juan Manuel Ruiz Garca, a member of the National Water
Council which has been consulted over the plan, the projected north-south
transfer of irrigation resources could repeat the mistakes made with the
Tajo-Segura trasvase.
Planned during the 1930s and built during the Franco years, the trasvase,
with its accompanying dams and reservoirs, was intended to provide
self-sufficiency in food, water supplies for the rapidly growing big cities
and the build-up of hydro-electric power.
But the huge irrigation projects it prompted now produce surplus EU crops,
the cities have stopped growing and cheaper power is available through
natural gas.
Worst of all, the all-important Buenda-Entrepenas reservoir never filled up;
with a capacity for 2.4bn cu m it held just 405m cu m earlier this year and
the trasvase, which was projected to carry 600m cu m annually, has never
carried more than half that.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Germany tries to force the pace over VAT: Bonn has bit
between its teeth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than any other group of industrialists in the European Union, the
German business community dislikes intensely the current arrangements for
collecting value added tax across the single market.
The system, introduced a year and a half ago when frontier controls between
the 12 member states were dropped, requires companies to do the paperwork
once carried out by customs, filing trade returns to domestic tax
authorities so that they can keep track of VAT payments. As far as Germany
is concerned, it is a burden on industry that should be changed at the
earliest possible opportunity.
For this reason, Germany has thrust VAT arrangements to the forefront of its
presidency in an effort to ensure that the EU remains on schedule for a
switch to the so-called 'definitive regime' of VAT on January 1, 1997. Under
this system VAT will be levied at the rate applicable in the country from
which the goods originate rather than at the rate applicable in the country
where they are sold.
The big advantage for business is that traders will no longer need to
differentiate between domestic and intra-Union sales.
Germany's eagerness has to be reckoned with. But when economics and finance
ministers meet in Brussels today for a meeting devoted entirely to tax, Mr
Theo Waigel, German finance minister, is unlikely to find his enthusiasm
matched by his counterparts.
Brussels has yet to produce its proposals on introducing the definitive
regime. German nagging has persuaded it to bring forward the publication
date to October, but meanwhile, the once reviled transitional arrangements
are settling down. There is also a growing feeling among business leaders
and tax officials that it would be unwise to impose an entirely new system
before the faults of the earlier one have been properly identified.
As Unice, the European confederation of industry put it: 'Due caution should
be exercised before moving to another system as the wrong choice would
involve European business in a substantial opportunity cost.'
Mrs Christiane Scrivener, commissioner in charge of indirect taxation, fears
that by pressing ministers to discuss the subject before any definite
proposals are on the table, the Germans might create confrontation and
problems.
She favours a more consultative approach - putting all the pieces of the
puzzle on the table, as she puts it, before sitting down to put it together.
Formulating proposals acceptable to all member states
will be difficult. The country of origin system throws up two conundrums.
First, such a regime needs to be accompanied by a clearing house system to
redistribute revenue around the Union. Without one, countries exporting a
lot of goods would benefit enormously, while high-import nations would lose.
The clearing house system is thus viewed with considerable mistrust by
states which fear they would not be justly recompensed.
Second, the origin-based system requires a far greater degree of
harmonisation of VAT rates. But countries like Britain do not want to
sacrifice zero-rating on categories such as children's clothes and oppose
uniform rates strongly. Market forces might be allowed to play their part in
harmonising rates, but some of the poorer countries argue that this would be
unfair until there is a greater degree of economic convergence.
Not content with keeping this complex and unpopular subject in the
limelight, the Germans today will also be raising the subject of a uniform
withholding tax. They want a common, European tax on savings, putting an end
to the huge flight of D-Marks from Germany, where there is a high tax on
savings, to Luxembourg, where there is none. Luxembourg and Britain
vehemently oppose such a move, arguing that it would lead to damaging
capital outflows from the EU to other tax havens such as Switzerland.
Mrs Scrivener is diplomatic: 'Germany is hoping to advance thought on the
matter,' she says. 'They want us to talk about it because they think perhaps
this could lead to new ideas.'
Perhaps the only area where the Germans can hope to make progress is on
energy taxes. It is suggesting that a straightforward energy tax should be
abandoned in favour of increased excise duties on mineral oils.
Some member states have already indicated that this approach is more likely
to lead to a consensus on how best to meet commitments to stabilise carbon
dioxide emissions by the end of the century. Quite how many countries are in
favour will emerge at today's meeting. Here at least, the Germans, working
in tandem with the French (who occupy the presidency of the Union after the
Germans) might see some advance.

FT  27 JUL 94 / IMF acts fast to woo Kuchma
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The encounter between Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the
International Monetary Fund, and Mr Leonid Kuchma, the new Ukrainian
president, in Kiev today will be remarkable in two respects.
The visit, two weeks after Mr Kuchma's election victory, suggests the IMF -
belying its careful image - is prepared to move quickly where Ukraine is
concerned.
Mr Kuchma's decision to make an IMF meeting one of his first acts in office
is also a signal that Ukraine, which over the past three years has gained a
reputation as one of the most economically backward republics, may have
begun to appreciate the importance of economic reforms and links with
western financial institutions.
IMF representatives caution that no agreements are scheduled to be signed
but senior Ukrainian officials hope it could be a turning point.
If Kiev undertakes three fundamental reforms - liberalisation of its
exchange rate, an austere budget and continued monetary discipline - IMF
officials say that within the next few months Kiev could receive a Dollars
700m (Pounds 452m) systemic transformation loan. That agreement could pave
the way for Ukraine to receive the Dollars 4bn in financial assistance
offered at the Group of Seven meeting in Naples.
'The opportunity to reach an agreement with the IMF is greater now than ever
before in Ukrainian history,' said Mr Volodymyr Kuznetsov, one of the
president's senior economic advisers.
'We have a consensus on the necessity to conduct market reforms. Our new
president has the political will which (ex-president Leonid) Kravchuk
lacked. The only question is speed.'
Mr Oleh Havrylyshyn, the Ukrainian associate director at the IMF who was an
outspoken critic of the economic policies of the Kravchuk government, says
'the IMF has been discussed more often in Ukrainian government circles over
the past two weeks than it had been over the past two years.' 'There's a
sense throughout the country that there is a new opportunity for reform,' he
said.
'Ukraine now has the chance Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary seized
three years ago although, because of the economic deterioration over the
past three years, Ukraine now faces a much more difficult task.'
However, Mr Viktor Pynzenyk, a former cabinet minister and one of Ukraine's
most zealous advocates of market reforms, warns that Mr Kuchma's economic
programme will be largely shaped by appointees to his administration. He
said Mr Kuchma could also face fierce opposition from the conservative
parliament.
'From the standpoint of the fund, Ukraine is a priority,' an IMF official
said. 'There is no delay and we are interested.' Western diplomats in Kiev
said the IMF has been under political pressure to reach an agreement with
Ukraine, whose stability is seen as a keystone to recovery in the region.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Economic Watch: German consumer prices rise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Consumer prices in the west German state of Hesse rose 0.1 per cent in the
month to mid-July for a year-on-year increase of 3 per cent, the state
statistics office said. Baden-Wurttemberg reported that consumer prices were
flat in July compared with June and up 3 per cent from a year earlier. North
Rhine-Westphalia reported month-on-month inflation at 0.1 per cent, with the
year-on-year figure up 2.7 per cent. These regional figures support
forecasts that annual inflation in western Germany will drop below 3 per
cent in July for the first time since April 1991.
Ukraine's industrial output was down 36 per cent in the first six months
compared to the same period last year, but the downward trend has slowed
since May, the statistics ministry said. The decline was largest in oil
refining, chemicals, machinery, metal manufacturing and construction
materials.

<TEXT>
Greece hopes to win European Commission approval today to grant Olympic
Airways, the loss-making state carrier, a capital injection totalling Dr54bn
(Pounds 147m) over the next three years, in return for eliminating certain
long-haul routes and opening up Aegean island routes to competition.
The rescue plan will be presented at the same time as the Commission gives
the go-ahead for a controversial FFr20bn (Pounds 2.4bn) state subsidy to Air
France, the French government-owned airline. Today's anticipated decisions
have angered Europe's non-subsidised airlines in what is being seen as a
test case in EU efforts to liberalise the air transport market.
The Olympic Airways rescue plan is aimed at making the Greek carrier
profitable by 1997. As well as the capital injection, it would allow Olympic
to write off Dr491bn of accumulated debt.
Airline officials said Olympic had agreed to waive its option on extending
its monopoly on domestic routes for five years after 1998, and would shut
loss-making routes to Tokyo and Chicago by the end of this year.
In return, the Commission has dropped a demand that Olympic immediately open
up ground handling operations at Greek airports to other carriers. Airline
officials say that retaining a monopoly on ground handling, which brings in
more than Dr35bn yearly, equivalent to 15 per cent of operating income, is
crucial to returning the carrier to profit.
However, the Commission has already said that it plans to use special powers
to break-up ground handling monopolies at larger European airports, a move
that would affect Athens airport, the country's only big airport.
The Greek government has also agreed to stop interfering in Olympic's
day-to-day operations and to accept close monitoring of restructuring by an
outside auditor, airline officials said. This will mean, among other things,
that cabinet ministers, civil servants and Greek Orthodox clergymen will no
longer be allowed special discounts on tickets.
Under the rescue plan, the airline's management is to be overhauled with the
help of outside consultants. Five out of 36 aircraft in its fleet will be
sold or returned to lessors, with no replacements before 1997.
The plan also calls for a two-year wage freeze and mandatory retirement of
1,950 employees over the next three years. Olympic's 10,000-strong workforce
will be made liable to Greek labour law, enabling seasonal and part-time
employees to be taken on during the peak tourist period.
The rescue plan forecasts that Olympic's Dr135bn loss in 1993 would be be
transformed into a Dr14bn profit next year, rising to Dr30bn in 1997.
Olympic Airways and Air France are the last of three airline aid cases to
come before Brussels so far this year. Earlier this month, the Commission
allowed Portugal to prop up the state-owned TAP-Air Portugal in return for a
commitment to restructure the company.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Growth in exports boosts manufacturing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further evidence that UK manufacturers are witnessing steady economic
recovery emerged yesterday after a business survey reported that improving
exports contributed to the fastest rise in manufacturing order books for
almost six years.
But a sharp rise in the number of businesses expecting to raise prices and
indications that capacity constraints may develop in some manufacturing
sectors gave a hint that this faster growth might fuel inflationary
pressures later this year.
With Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, due to hold his
monthly meeting tomorrow with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, these
findings may add to speculation that interest rates will be raised soon.
The Confederation of British Industry's quarterly industrial trends survey,
for the three months to July, showed that one in five manufacturers expects
to raise prices in the next four months, while only 8 per cent expect to
reduce them.
In the previous survey, conducted in April, slightly more manufacturers were
expecting to reduce prices than raise them.
Sir David Lees, chairman of the CBI's economic affairs committee, yesterday
admitted that this change was 'worrying'. But he called on the government to
hold interest rates steady until at least the autumn. He said: 'In our
judgment, the inflation pressures are not sufficiently serious to suggest
that monetary policy should be tightened immediately.'
The price rises, he pointed out, were occurring from a relatively low base
and the continued intense domestic competition meant that manufacturers had
generally not been able to make price rises stick in recent months, even
where they had been expecting increases.
The Treasury yesterday welcomed the figures as evidence that the recovery
was 'becoming broader and stronger'.
With the government hoping that the recovery will become more export-driven
later this year, after being largely fuelled by domestic consumer
consumption last year, a steady rise in the reported level of export
performance was 'encouraging', Treasury officials said.
Meanwhile, concerns about the expectation of higher prices were yesterday
fuelled in the City by hints in the CBI survey that bottlenecks were
developing in some manufacturing sectors. The survey said the number of
companies working below capacity fell back to 54 per cent in the last
quarter, compared to 59 per cent in April.
The survey gave little sign that UK companies were yet seriously addressing
potential capacity constraints. Investment intentions grew at a relatively
weak rate last quarter, with only slightly more companies expecting to
increase their investment on plant and equipment than expecting to reduce
it.
The findings yesterday led Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the stockbroker, to
predict an earlier and larger increase in base rates, not least because the
expectation of higher inflation had been cited by Mr George as a factor that
would call for tighter monetary policy.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Railtrack and RMT agree to restart talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR and CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Railtrack and the RMT transport union last night agreed to resume talks over
the signalling dispute. The move came during the first 48-hour strike of
signalling staff, which is due to continue until noon tomorrow.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, responded positively to an appeal
made earlier yesterday by Mr Bob Horton, chairman of Railtrack, which owns
and maintains Britain's rail network.
The two sides are expected to meet at the offices of the conciliation
service Acas in the next few days. Their last such meeting ended in deadlock
on July 12.
Mr Horton told Mr Knapp in a letter that he was willing 'to negotiate
further on the offer on the table'. He added: 'We remain available at any
time to continue the process of negotiation on that basis.'
'We believe we have common ground,' said a Railtrack spokesman. 'All
elements of our last offer are negotiable.'
Last night Mr Knapp told Mr Horton: 'You are now apparently saying that you
are willing to negotiate further on all aspects of the offer on the table.'
He added: 'If you are saying - and I think you are - that you are ready and
willing to return to the negotiating table without constraints and
preconditions we are more than willing to resume talks.'
Mr Knapp said he found Mr Horton's letter 'a welcome confirmation of your
public stance' on being ready to negotiate.
Earlier yesterday Mr Knapp said that 'if Mr Horton is now saying there are
no 'no-go areas' and he is willing to negotiate freely then I am willing to
test Railtrack's sincerity in the next two days'. Mr Knapp added: 'If they
are genuinely seeking negotiations without excluding the issue of basic
rates, we are ready to meet at any time.'
Railtrack confirmed that it was willing to discuss basic pay rates.
Mr Knapp also said that the union was ready to negotiate a restructuring
package for the signalling grades through a joint working party.
Yesterday Railtrack said up to 30 per cent of train services ran in the
afternoon, despite the start of the RMT's first 48-hour stoppage, while 34
per cent of the network was open. But the company warned it might be hard to
maintain that level of service with the problems of getting trains into
position.
The opening of signal boxes at Colchester in Essex and Three Bridges in
Sussex meant that services from London Liverpool Street to Norwich and from
London Victoria to Gatwick airport were possible for the first time during
strike action.
Red Star, the parcels service owned by British Rail but currently up for
sale, said it was diverting packages from rail to road and air.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Supervisors alert banks on bonuses: Payments to derivatives
dealers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's banks have been warned not to tie the bonuses paid to financial
derivatives dealers too closely to the profits of the products they sell as
this could create excessive risks.
The Basle Committee of international supervisors gave the warning in its
guidelines for bank supervisors, published yesterday, on how banks should
manage derivatives such as swaps and options.
Similar guidelines were issued yesterday to regulators of securities firms
by the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (Iosco). The
guidelines come amid debate over the derivative trading activities of banks
and securities firms and follow proposals from the Basle Committee this
month that banks should have to hold more capital to cover derivative risks.
The Basle committee suggests that banks could be at risk if their dealers -
some of whom attract multi-million dollar bonuses - are paid on the
profitability of the trades without the risks being considered.
Their guidelines place strong emphasis on senior directors of banks being
told in plain language about the risks they may be running. They say that
the risks should be translated into simple terms in internal reports.
Supervisors in individual Group of Ten countries covered by the Basle
committee are also told to ensure that banks do not allow their traders to
start selling new derivatives products before managers understand them.
Mr Tommasso Padoa-Schioppa, the Basle committee chairman, said the
guidelines would help banks improve risk management systems.
He said banks and securities regulators had worked jointly on guidelines
despite the fact that they issued separate documents. There has been a
history of division between the two industries' supervisors.
There was a split between the Basle Committee and Iosco last year, when
efforts to devise joint rules on capital charges for trading activities
broke down. The Iosco guidelines warn that the potential profits from
derivatives may lead firms to 'ignore or underestimate' risks, particularly
those from new products. The Basle guidelines warn of the 'liquidity risks'
of being unable to unwind lossmaking positions in volatile markets.

FT  27 JUL 94 / Rabin warns of new wave of terror: Israel fears London bomb
part of campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Israel's prime minister Mr Yitzhak Rabin warned yesterday the world was
facing a new wave of radical Islamic terrorism after a powerful bomb blasted
the country's embassy in London, a day after Israel signed a historic
co-operation agreement with Jordan.
The car bomb attack injured 13 people, extensively damaged the embassy in
west London and rocked nearby buildings in the capital's 'embassy row',
including Kensington Palace, where four members of the British royal family
were unharmed.
Yesterday's blast followed a car bomb attack on a Jewish centre in Buenos
Aires on July 18 which killed at least 96 people, and prompted Mr Rabin to
suggest that European and American countries were at risk from 'a wave' of
attacks by extremists.
'They continue a struggle of terror to kill Israelis, to fight against
moderate Arab regimes and to do everything to undermine any possibility . .
. to bring about a comprehensive peace between Israel and its neighbouring
Arab countries and the Palestinians,' he said.
The blast at around 12.10pm occurred without warning, although one embassy
official said a vehicle driven by a woman had been diverted by security
staff from the main entrance minutes before the explosion outside the
embassy.
Commander David Tucker, head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad in
London, said last night police were seeking a woman of 55 to 60 years,
believed to have been driving the car, which was thought to contain 20-30lb
of commercial explosives.
Asked whether there was a connection with the bomb in Buenos Aires,
Commander Tucker said: 'This was a much smaller bomb and the connection is
obviously that the target is the Israelis.'
Ms Rachel Gordan, a member of the embassy press office, said: 'It was a
huge, huge explosion. Parts of the building just collapsed.' Builder Mr
Michael Hassit who was working nearby said he saw a 'big plume of smoke and
debris going up to 200 feet up in the air'.
According to Israeli officials, the London embassy together with other
Jewish buildings around the world have been on heightened security alert
since the Buenos Aires attack.
However, the attackers clearly managed to exploit vulnerable security points
around the embassy building in an operation which some security experts
believe would have taken several weeks to plan.
Mr Douglas Hogg, Foreign Office minister, described the latest attack as a
'shocking offence' and promised that security in the UK would be stepped up.
He added, however, that there could not be full security guarantees in an
'open city like London'.
Mr Rabin spoke shortly before he addressed a joint session of the US
Congress with King Hussein of Jordan. The King told congress he had come to
Washington to 'secure a peace for all the children of Abraham'. The King
also called for international aid to make the peace struck between leaders
'real to the men, women and children of the Middle East'.
However, Mr Rabin said that unless the world woke up to a new threat Israel,
moderate Arab regimes and even European, American and Latin American
countries would be at risk from Iranian-backed terrorism that he dubbed
'Khomeinism without Khomeini,' referring to the former Iranian leader.

FT  26 JUL 94 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: New York flotation raises
Dollars 479m for Bell Cablemedia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 27th July 1994) appended to this article.
Bell Cablemedia, the UK's third largest combined cable television and
telephone operator, has raised Dollars 479m (Pounds 309m) in equity and debt
on the New York Stock Exchange.
The public offering of 13.1m American Depositary Shares raised Dollars 204m,
and an issue of senior notes - 10-year debt - another Dollars 275m, in the
second and largest cash-raising exercise for UK cable on the New York
exchange.
Bell Cablemedia groups the UK cable interests of Bell Canada International,
the international arm of Canada's largest telecommunications operator, Cable
and Wireless, the UK telecoms group whose subsidiaries include Mercury, the
main long-distance competitor to British Telecommunications, and Jones
Intercable, one of the largest US cable television operators, with systems
in 24 states.
Following the ADS offering BCI owns 42.2 per cent of Bell Cablemedia, C&amp;W
12.8 per cent, and Jones Intercable and affiliates 14.1 per cent.
Bell Cablemedia has outright ownership of 18 UK cable franchises, and in
addition a one-third stake in Videotron's UK cable interests. Its largest
franchises cover Leeds (282,000 homes) and greater London east (229,000
homes).
Allowing for the equity share in Videotron, its franchises cover 2m homes,
which puts it behind Telewest and Nynex, both US groups, in size.
Bell Cablemedia is, however, the largest UK cable company yet to have
floated. Telewest and Comcast pulled flotations planned earlier this year in
the face of market weakness.
The only flotation to date was of International Cabletel last summer, which
raised about Dollars 450m in debt and equity in New York to finance new UK
cable ventures. Last autumn it established a Pounds 200m joint venture with
South Wales Electricity to build a cable TV and telephone network covering
most of urban south Wales.
When the Bell Cablemedia grouping took shape earlier this year, in advance
of the flotation, it said it was likely to float in both London and New
York. The company yesterday blamed logistical difficulties and market
conditions for the decision not to float in London, but said it hoped to
attempt a London flotation within 12 to 18 months.
At least four other cable groups are also hoping for flotations in the next
18 months, but are waiting for a market revival before committing
themselves.
Some UK investors are cautious about cable prospects in the face of BT's
strenuous campaign to end the government ban on its providing entertainment
services, imposed in 1991 as an encouragement to cable investment.
A House of Commons select committee will report on Wednesday in favour of an
easing of the ban, in a move likely to unsettle investor confidence.
CORRECTION
Bell Cablemedia has secured a listing on the Nasdaq stock exchange, not the
New York Stock Exchange as reported in yesterday's FT.

<TEXT>
Mr Jean-Pierre Rodier, who is due to take over as chairman of Pechiney later
this week, believes that the French state-owned aluminium and packaging
company will probably be privatised in 1996.
He also believes that the priority for the company was to return to profit.
In 1993, Pechiney suffered a net loss of FFr980m (Dollars 180m).
Mr Rodier said that, although 1996 might seem distant, it does not leave
much time for the company to prepare itself for sale. In addition to
reversing its losses, the company is also at the centre of a proposed, but
complex, alliance with Compagnie Nationale du Rhone, the hydro-electricity
producer.

Coflexip, the French manufacturer of flexible pipe for the offshore oil
industry, has proposed a merger with Stena Offshore, the sub-sea contracting
arm of Stena of Sweden. The Dollars 230m transaction will create a sub-sea
oilfield products and services group with sales of Dollars 650m.
Coflexip, whose biggest shareholders include Elf Aquitaine, will finance the
deal through a combination of securities and Dollars 30m in cash.
Mr Christian Marbach, Coflexip's chairman, said Stena's strengths in
offshore contracting made the merger a good match. Coflexip's skill,
meanwhile, was in manufacturing and technology.

<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft, the German industrial group crippled last year by its
energy dealings in the US, yesterday revealed it was planning to end its
loss-making relationship with Castle Energy, a US refiner.
Long-term oil contracts between Castle, of which the German group owns 40
per cent, and MG Corp, its principal US subsidiary, have continued to sap
the group's profits in the months since it organised a financial rescue.
MG Corp is committed to buying Castle's output under contracts stretching
into the next century, at prices above normal market levels. The company is
believed to have been trying to negotiate changes to the contracts for some
months, with no success.
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday, MG
disclosed it was seeking to 'terminate and/or modify' its relationship with
Castle.
If it is unable to agree a settlement with Castle, then it is likely to
remove financial support from the company, virtually all of whose debt is
owed to MG. The German group warned it did not intend to extend debt which
falls due from Castle on September 30.
Yesterday's news represents an attempt by MG to increase the pressure on
Castle in the renegotiations of its contracts with the German group. If
these fail MG could face substantial costs, including the write-off of its
investment in the company and the loss of much of the debt it is owed.
The contracts between MG and Castle have been the subject of intense
investigation this year. 'Castle Energy is a money-making machine, and MG
Corp is a money-destroying machine,' Mr Kajo Neukirchen,
Metallgesellschaft's chairman, was reported as saying recently.
'Whoever is responsible for the 76 individual contracts between MG Corp and
Castle Energy must have certainly had an ulterior motive,' he added.

Gambia's new leaders pledged yesterday to name a democratic government as
soon as possible following their weekend coup and partially lifted a
dusk-to-dawn curfew, Reuter reports from Banjul.
'We will never introduce dictatorship in this country because the average
Gambian is being nurtured with democracy,' Lieutenant Edward Singhatey, 25,
a member of the five-man ruling military council, said.
Ousted president Sir Dawda Jawara arrived in Senegal on Sunday evening with
about 40 relatives and officials and was granted political asylum on
humanitarian grounds.
In Banjul, diplomats said people were going to work normally on Monday but
the airport and land borders were still closed. Officials said the curfew
had been relaxed to midnight to 6 am instead of 7 pm to 7 am

They were BCCI's founder and former president, Mr Agha Hassan Abedi, who was
sentenced to eight years in absentia and is an invalid in Karachi; Mr
Mohammed Swaleh Naqvi, who was sentenced to 14 years in absentia and had
already been extradited to the US to stand trial on BBCI-related charges
following an agreement between Abu Dhabi and the US justice department; and
Mr Ziauddin Ali Akbar, who is in jail in London.
Mr Mohammed al-Dhahiri, United Arab Emirates attorney general, is appealing

<TEXT>
Foreigners working for multinational oil groups in Nigeria said yesterday
they were taking seriously threats by striking oil unions and pro-democracy
groups against expatriate strike-breakers, Reuter reports from Lagos.
An oil industry official said the threats had forced companies to tighten
security at terminals.
Both striking oil unions, Nupeng and Pengassan, have warned oil companies
that action would be taken if expatriate staff did not stop work and back
the strike to force an end to military rule in Nigeria and gain better
management of the oil industry.
The unions blame the use of expatriate staff and some senior Nigerian
management staff for the failure of the strike, now in its fourth week, to
cause serious disruption to crude oil production and exports.

FT  26 JUL 94 / PRI 'set to win' in Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The ruling party in Mexico is set for a comfortable victory in the
presidential election next month, according to a new opinion poll by the
Indemerc/Louis Harris organisation.
It gave Mr Ernesto Zedillo, candidate of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI), 50.3 per cent support, against 32.2 per cent for
Mr Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the centre-right opposition. Mr Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas, candidate of the left, was shown as a poor third on 13.4 per cent.
Opinion polls are very controversial in Mexico. Some analysts contend that
respondents are unwilling to reveal opposition to the governing party, which
has been in power for 65 years. Pollsters emphasise that preferences are
unusually volatile this year and that the final result will probably be
affected by the turnout on August 21, which is hard to predict.
However, the Indemerc/Louis Harris poll was based on 2,550 interviews in 25
states, making it much more extensive than most polls in Mexico. It was paid
for by members of Mexico's Chamber of Radio and Television.
Mr Zedillo's big lead is at odds with recent polls by Mori of Mexico, which
show Mr Zedillo and Mr Fernandez neck and neck. But the Mori poll is based
on a sample of about 300 from five main cities, giving it a larger margin of
error.
The Indemerc/Harris poll showed Mr Zedillo leading by 56:24 per cent in
rural areas, by tradition strong PRI ground. In the cities, Mr Zedillo had
47:37 per cent over Mr Fernandez.
Mr Fernandez has been affected by his low-key campaign since a television
debate in May, which he was judged to have won. The poll shows his support
then at a peak of 41 per cent, several points ahead of Mr Zedillo. Since
May, though, his support has slipped and Mr Zedillo has gained.

FT  26 JUL 94 / International Company News: American Express hit by weakness
at Lehman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After-tax profits at American Express fell 14 per cent in the second three
months of the year. It blamed lower profits at Lehman Brothers, the
investment bank which was spun off during the period.
Had it not been for Lehman, the US financial services company's earnings
would have advanced 19 per cent, to Dollars 359m, on the back of higher
spending on its charge cards and similar products.
Lehman, which last week revealed that its second-quarter results had
suffered from poor trading conditions in financial markets, was accounted
for as a discontinued item.
American Express reported net income of Dollars 357m, or 69 cents a share,
on revenues of Dollars 3.5bn, compared with Dollars 416m, or 83 cents, on
revenues of Dollars 3.3bn a year before.
The growth in earnings from continuing operations was driven by a 12 per
cent rise in spending billed to the company's cards, to Dollars 34.6bn. The
total number of cards was 5 per cent higher than a year before.
Despite this, card fees fell slightly, to Dollars 431m, reflecting
competition between issuers. On the other hand, revenues from fees charged
to merchants, which have been under pressure in recent periods, rose 9 per
cent to Dollars 983m.
American Express also reported continued profit growth at its IDS Financial
Services subsidiary, up 21 per cent to Dollars 109m. The subsidiary's name
is to be changed to American Express Financial Advisers at the beginning of
next year, the company said. The move reflect's chairman Mr Harvey Golub's
desire to retain only those businesses which add to the overall brand image
of the group.
For the first six months, net income was up to Dollars 710m from Dollars
659m the year before.

FT  26 JUL 94 / International Company News: Pilots offer USAir Dollars 750m
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pilots at USAir,the sixth-largest carrier in the US, have offered to make
Dollars 750m in payroll concessions over five years in exchange for an
equity position in the airline.
The proposal, submitted by the Air Lines Pilots Association, was a response
to USAir's call for Dollars 1bn in overall cost reductions by 1997.
The initial reaction by USAir, in which British Airways has a 22 per cent
stake, was positive. The airline said it was 'pleased' the pilots
'recognised the need to move forward and was looking forward to discussions'
over the union's ideas.
Further talks between the two sides had not been scheduled, however.
The development comes just two weeks after shareholders of UAL, parent of
United Airlines, approved a plan giving its employees a 55 per cent stake in
the carrier in exchange for pay cuts and changes in work rules.
The offer by USAir's pilots envisages a 'restructuring' of the carrier's
financial obligations, and a 'substantial' influx of fresh capital. In
return for average annual pay reductions of Dollars 150m, the pilots are
seeking 'substantial investment returns through equity, preferred stock and
profit sharing'. The union said it would complete the details of its
proposal this week, and present them 'shortly'.
The wage cuts represented 'the same share of the (company's) goal as our
share of the total payrolls', the union said.
USAir surprised Wall Street last week by posting improved net income of
Dollars 13.8m in the second quarter, against Dollars 5.8m a year earlier.

FT  26 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Marling ends year Pounds 0.7m in the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marling Industries yesterday reported it had ended the year in the black and
said it was joining the small number of UK companies to make a distribution
to shareholders in the form of a foreign income dividend.
The industrial textiles company is taking advantage of the new regulations
aimed at alleviating the tax burden on businesses which have a strong bias
towards overseas profits.
Mr William Rollason, finance director, said the saving of Pounds 200,000 in
advance corporation tax on conventional dividends would be passed on to
shareholders in the form of a higher dividend.
A final pay-out of a net 0.57p has been recommended, making a total of 0.77p
(0.65p), on a capital base increased 10 per cent by a rights issue last
July. The increased dividend will compensate non-tax paying institutional
shareholders which would have clawed back the ACT on conventional dividends.
Under the FID scheme, companies pay dividends out of foreign income. They
were devised to aid companies which suffer under the UK tax regime when
their mainstream corporation tax liability was insufficient to offset their
ACT liability on dividends.
Announced in last year's budget, FIDs have been used by BAT Industries, the
tobacco and financial services group, and Courts, the home furnishings
retailer.
Marling's overseas operations, which account for 90 per cent of profits,
helped it return to the black with pre-tax profits of Pounds 743,000 in the
year to March 31 against losses of Pounds 9.6m last time.
Exceptional costs were Pounds 1.4m, compared with Pounds 8.7m which included
losses on disposal of discontinued operations.
Pressure on prices pushed turnover on continuing operations down from Pounds
54.7m to Pounds 48.6m. Total turnover was down 25 per cent from Pounds 79m
to Pounds 59m, including Pounds 6.5m from acquisitions and Pounds 3.96m
(Pounds 24.3m) from discontinued operations. Overseas operations contributed
75 per cent of sales.
Marling's strongest performance came from its automotive seat belt webbing
divisions in the Netherlands and Australia. Exports from Webco, its
Australian offshoot, continued to grow, particularly to India, Japan, New
Zealand and China. Mr David Smith, chief executive, said these markets
offered longer term joint venture possibilities.
Mr Smith said high organic growth was anticipated from Muller, a German
manufacturer of elasticated bandages, sports bandages and incontinence
products acquired in July last year.
Overcapacity and pressure on prices contributed to an erosion of margins in
the company's UK and German industrial webbing divisions.
Gearing had risen from 84 per cent last time to 95 per cent. Mr Rollason
said the target was to reduce this to 75 per cent by the end of the next
financial year.
Losses per share fell from 7.66p to 0.13p.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Cost of rail strike put at Pounds 330m for July
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, ALISON SMITH and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The signalling strike could cost the British economy about Pounds 330m this
month, according to an estimate by a leading accountancy firm.
Mr Maurice Fitzpatrick of the accountants Chantrey Vellacott bases his
calculations on British Rail's estimate that each day's strike results in
lost revenue of Pounds 10m.
In total, there are 125,000 rail workers and Mr Fitzpatrick assumes that a
further 375,000 people are unable to work because of the strike.
Assuming that the output of each commuter is worth about 1.5 times that of a
railway worker, Mr Fitzpatrick calculates that each day-long strike will
cost the economy about Pounds 55m in lost output. This week's three-day
stoppage will result in a loss of Pounds 165m.
A figure of Pounds 330m still represents only about two-thirds of 1 per cent
of July's total gross domestic product. If the rail strike were to end this
month therefore the affect on the full-year GDP would be negligible.
But Mr Fitzpatrick calculates that if the strike continues to worsen into
September, with stoppages affecting eight days a month, it could reduce
full-year GDP by about 0.2 per cent.
The Institute of Directors estimates that the strike has already cost
industry 'hundreds of millions of pounds'. Its employment spokesman Mr Ira
Chalpin said yesterday that the dispute was 'damaging the reputation of this
country as a reliable place to do business'.
However, Mr Andrew Sentance of the London Business School cast doubt on the
Pounds 330m estimate. 'Business can find other ways of doing things and even
if those ways are more costly, the extra costs for one company constitute
revenues for another group,' he said.
For high street banks with a network of London branches and many staff
commuting into the capital from the Home Counties, this week's extended rail
strike means a greater use of coaches.
Lloyds Bank has been using about 80 coaches to bring up to 4,000 staff into
London at a cost of Pounds 50,000 a day. Camp beds have been set up in the
bank's Lombard Street headquarters for a few essential staff. Midland Bank
has been hiring more than 50 coaches, at a cost of about Pounds 10,000 a
day, to bring 500-600 employees to their offices and branches. National
Westminster Bank's bussing operation has been smaller.
But many other large employers such as Imperial Chemical Industries and
companies in the engineering industry reported yesterday that the strikes
would have little impact on their operations.
It is estimated that only 7 per cent of bulk materials are carried by rail.
The likely impact of the dispute is to encourage more companies to switch
their freight business from rail to road.
The impact of this week's stoppages on commuters may also be less serious
because many are going on holiday and this will reduce the need to travel by
rail over the coming weeks.

<TEXT>
Mr Richard Gephardt, the US House majority leader, and 28 other House
members are proposing an expansion of the US-Israel free trade agreement to
include countries which sign comprehensive peace accords with Israel, Nancy
Dunne writes from Washington.
The proposal is supported by many Democrats who have been prominent on both
sides of trade debates.
The US and Israel signed a free trade pact in 1985, spurring an increase in
trade between the two countries. 'Expanding this agreement will require the
US and Israel to negotiate with each new party for reciprocal elimination of
trade barriers,' Mr Gephardt said.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Banking bill advances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Legislation which would let US banks open branches across state lines leapt
an important hurdle yesterday when a joint panel of the US Senate and House
of Representatives approved a compromise bill.
The proposal has the backing of the Clinton administration and looks set to
become law within weeks, if it hits no last-minute obstructions in either
Senate or House.
Under the bill, bank holding companies would be able to acquire banks in
other states one year after the bill was enacted. They would be able to
merge their operations across state lines into branch networks after July 1,
1997. However, the bill would allow individual states to opt out of
inter-state banking.
The Senate/House panel failed to agree on powers which would have
strengthened the administration's hand when negotiating the opening of
overseas financial markets to US companies.
Many barriers to nationwide banking in the US have fallen in recent years,
as individual states have dropped their restrictions.
Many now permit ownership of local banks by financial institutions based in
other states which have similar open regulations, though fewer permit
branches of out-of-state banks. Only Hawaii permits no inter-state banking.
Even so, the prospect of federal legislation has spurred the growth of large
regional banking groups in the US in recent years. Knowing that Congress was
likely to act, many states have moved before they otherwise would have to
pass their own laws.
Also, the spate of big bank acquisitions in recent months is likely to have
been prompted in part by opportunism among banks which benefit from the
current patchwork of state regulations. Once legislation opens the takeover
market to all banks equally, there is likely to be greater competition for
acquisitions.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Bosnian Serbs crank up pressure on UN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bosnian Serb forces appeared yesterday to be ratcheting up their war of
nerves with the United Nations, in an ominous hint of how much more trouble
they could cause if they are punished for rejecting a peace plan.
UN officials said one civilian was killed and another wounded by Serb
gunfire in the Moslem enclave of Gorazde, a so-called total exclusion zone
where heavy weapons are potentially subject to Nato air strikes.
The UN also blamed the Serbs for the anti-aircraft fire at Sarajevo airport
last week which has forced the suspension of relief flights. The Serbs have
denied that they were responsible.
In a third challenge to the UN, the Serbs refused to allow the evacuation of
35 sick people from Gorazde unless all Serb prisoners held by the Moslem-led
Bosnian government were released.
Negotiators from the five-nation contact group which has devised a partition
arrangement for Bosnia conferred in Moscow yesterday over how to respond to
the Serbs' ambiguous reply to the proposal.
A statement by the group said they discussed 'additional measures aimed at
removing the objections from all sides in the conflict'.
The group's members - the US, Russia, Britain, France and Germany - were
united in pressing for acceptance of the peace deal but they appear divided
over how to cope with the plan's apparent failure. No firm decisions are
expected until the group's foreign ministers meet in Geneva at the weekend.
Mr Igor Ivanov, the Russian first deputy foreign minister who chaired the
meeting, said before it began that the group would continue to strive for
acceptance of the latest peace plan - accepted by the Croat-Moslem alliance
but effectively rejected by leaders of the Bosnian Serbs.
'We believe we have a plan that is balanced and realistic and reflects the
interests of all sides,' Mr Ivanov said. 'It would hardly be expedient to
abandon it.'
General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, will arrive in former
Yugoslavia today, where he is expected to meet Serbia's President Slobodan
Milosevic and possibly the Bosnian Serbs as well.
Gen Grachev has often been in direct communication with General Ratko
Mladic, head of the Bosnian Serb army, and the Russian minister may be one
of the few people who can exercise any influence over the Serb commander.
Diplomats believe the Russians would welcome some show of flexibility from
the Serb side, whose intransigence could threaten the broader relation
between Russia and the west. But any unilateral moves against the Serbs
could arouse an angry reaction in Moscow.
Yesterday, Russia announced a wide-ranging defence co-operation agreement
with Greece calling for joint exercises, possible co-production of weapons
and the exchange of information on defence matters.
Greece is the only European Union member which shares Russia's traditional
sympathy for the Serbs.
Mr Gerasimos Arsenis, the Greek defence minister, said that the positions of
Athens and Moscow about the situation in Bosnia were close.

FT  26 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lucas rallies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Automotive and aerospace components group Lucas Industries rallied from an
early fall to close 5 down at 193p, after it denied a US press report
claiming it was under criminal investigation regarding inspection of parts
for commercial aircraft.
At the day's worst the shares were down 15 at 183p. However, comments from
City analysts and a company statement in the second half of the session -
saying that 'there were and are no quality problems' - helped steady nerves.
Sentiment was further enhanced by a recommendation from Henderson
Crosthwaite, a long-term bull for the shares. Leaving its current year
profits estimate at a top of the range Pounds 60m, the broker raised its
estimate for the following year by Pounds 2m to Pounds 140m.
In a note on the components sector, Mr Robert Speed at Henderson said:
'Lucas remains a recovery situation and the adverse share price reaction to
the reports from the US provide a cheap buying opportunity.'
Tobacco giant BAT Industries rose 7 to 432p after a batch of broker buy
notes ahead of tomorrow's interim figures. SG Warburg, James Capel and
Nomura were all supporting the shares as the market anticipated profits of
between Pounds 880m and Pounds 920m. Last year the group reported a profit
of Pounds 902m but that included a Pounds 123m exceptional profit and
analysts have been taking heart from recent figures released by US rival
Philip Morris which pointed to a general increase in sales.
High street bank Barclays was weaker than its rivals in the sector as it was
announced that a German subsidiary Merck, Finck &amp; Co had been named in an
investigation by the Frankfurt public prosecutor into press allegations of
insider trading. The shares closed 3 lighter at 542p.
Improving optimism over the domestic drinks market worked its way into a
number of second line brewing and pub stocks.
Cider-maker Merrydown plunged into losses and the final dividend was slashed
from 7.0p to 2.5p. Profits were hit by a big restructuring charge. The
shares slipped 2 to 130.
In a quiet food manufacturing sector, attention was again focused on one of
the sector's favourite bid candidates, United Biscuits. However, turnover of
just one million was enough to send the share price up 6 at 322p. Cadbury
Schweppes, a wistfully rumoured predator, retreated 9 to 425p.
Adverse press comment hurt Hillsdown, off 3 at 161p. Northern Foods slipped
4 to 202p as NatWest Securities warned of the uncertainties surrounding the
shake-up in the UK dairy industry. Unigate lost 2 to 360p.
Weekend press speculation over a hostile bid for William Low, the Scottish
supermarket group under a friendly offer from Tesco, sent the former's
shares shooting forward. J Sainsbury remains the market's favourite, being
Tesco's biggest rival, under-represented in Scotland and having requested
information from Low's regarding Tesco's offer last week. Low shares ended
13 ahead on 278p with turnover a hefty 2.6m. Tesco fell 4 to 237p, while
Sainsbury added a penny to 406p.
Shares in engineering group GKN and components company T&amp;N also benefited
from the review by Henderson Crosthwaite. The former closed 3 ahead at 627p,
after the broker raised its 1995 forecast by Pounds 25m to 245m, and the
latter put on 7 to 249p, as Henderson increased its estimate for the
following year by Pounds 15m to Pounds 135m.
Motor distributors were firm in anticipation of good new car registrations
for the month of August. Lex Service put on 10 to 474p, ahead of today's
interim figures, and Cowie firmed 3 to 285p.
Worries over leasing at British Aerospace left the shares trailing 9 1/2 to
502 1/2p.
Blenheim, the exhibitions organiser, was one of the big casualties in the
market as the shares responded to a Sunday newspaper article which took a
hard hitting approach to the company's performance over the past decade. The
shares fell 43 to 257p.
London International Group, the condoms and surgical gloves company, held
steady at 85p on relief that the rump of its recent Pounds 115.2m rights
issue had been successfully placed with institutional investors. SG Warburg,
the underwriter, placed the remaining at 84p a share 11.7 per cent, a
healthy premium to the issue price of 70p a share.
Last week's improved UK construction statistics continued to feed through to
selected stocks in the construction and building materials sectors. Among
the former, Barratt Developments was helped by a share tip in the weekend
press. The shares added 3 to 200p. Amec and Beazer managed rises of 2 to
117p and 163p respectively. Westbury put on 6 to 174p.
Among materials groups, RMC advanced 3 to 950p as it announced plans to
spend Pounds 15m over the next five years upgrading its lime production
operations. Elsewhere, Caradon rose 3 to 309p, and Marshalls 3 to 148p.
Recent strength among water and electricity utilities was checked by the
dull market as regulatory issues, the subject of some optimism last week,
were now perceived as more bearish.
South West was the biggest casualty among water stocks, the shares dropping
14 to 520p.

FT  26 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Switch benefits Wellcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmaceutical group Wellcome rose 10 to 644p as it responded to firm US
buying with investors said to be switching out of UK sector leader Glaxo.
The move was seen as a response to the positive underlying tone of the most
recent interim trading report from Wellcome and the legal problems which
bedevil Glaxo.
Wellcome last week reported sales of its best-selling drug, the anti-herpes
treatment Zovirax, ahead 15 per cent in the 10 months to the end of June.
However, there had been confusion over the figures as the company had
changed its accounting period to a calendar year end and the shares had been
initially marked down.
Subsequent press comment suggested that, if Wellcome failed to exploit the
over-the-counter market for Zovirax, other cash-rich groups might see it as
a plausible takeover target. Glaxo faces the threat of generic competition
to its Zantac ulcer drug. The shares fell 6 to 568p in the wake of Friday's
legal claims and counter claims over the plan by Novopharm of Canada to sell
generic Zantac pills based on Form 1 of the medicine.

FT  26 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dealers in derivatives reported a dull and uneventful session which resulted
in directionless trading and poor turnover, writes Joel Kibazo.
Traders pointed to the begining of school holidays and the start of today's
rail strikes among reasons for the poor day in the market.
Having started trading at 3,116, the September futures contract on the FT-SE
100 drifted lower over the next few hours on the back of UK Gilts that were
trading easier ahead of tomorrow's auction. The underlying cash market
followed September lower though dealing activity remained very thin indeed.
The recovery in gilts together with a squeeze in the last hour of trading
brought a turnaround in September. Moving strongly ahead, it touched a peak
of 3,128 just ahead of the close, before finishing at 3,127, in line with
Friday's close and at a 24 point premium to cash. Volume at 7,478 was very
poor.
Activity in the traded options was equally poor and turnover at the close
was a mere 18,943 lots, against Friday's total of 41,178 contracts.
The contribution from the index options was 5,183 lots dealt in the FT-SE
100 option and 2,421 in the Euro FT-SE option. J Sainsbury was the most
active stock option with Kleinwort Benson said to have carried out a
'roll-over' trade in the stock. Its closing volume was 1,717.

FT  26 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares drift nervously in thin
trading volume - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of the August holiday beaches, or perhaps of the extended rail
strike which starts in the UK this afternoon, appeared to take the heart out
of the London stock market yesterday. Trading volume was down by nearly one
third from Friday and shares could do little more than drift against a
background of weak bond markets.
In early trade, the FT-SE Index lost the 3,100 mark regained so painfully
last week and for most of the day the market traded just above this
benchmark level. A firmer trend in the US dollar helped the stock market
rally towards the close, and the final reading put the FT-SE Index at
3,106.1 for a net loss on the day of 8.6. The picture was little different
across the broader range of shares, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index shedding 6.9 to
3,624.
Many of the big securities houses were rearranging their trading portfolios
ahead of tomorrow's auction of Pounds 2bn UK government bonds, and this
doubtless inhibited their activities in the equity market. Bond markets were
also digesting the reminder from the chairman of the Federal Reserve
chairman that further rises in US interest rates could yet be needed to curb
inflationary pressures.
But the most accurate picture of UK equity trading came from the total of
Seaq-reported shares which at only 431.4m was around 30 per cent down on the
total for the previous session. Friday's retail business in equities was
worth Pounds 1.21bn.
The market opened cautiously, keeping a close eye on the US dollar and also
influenced by the latest survey of business opinion from the Confederation
of British Industry; this indicated that British companies are not convinced
that domestic inflation will be kept within the targets set by the UK
government.
But, in keeping with the poor trading volume, the market largely failed to
develop a convincing trend during early dealings, when it was left to
special situation stocks to provide the highlights.
This week is light on economic news, with the latest US gross domestic
product statistics, due on Friday, likely to provide the sole focus of
attention. The Bundesbank, now into its summer recess, has effectively put
its interest rate policy on hold for three weeks.
The initial fall in the Footsie, which took it down by 15.7 to 3,099,
reflected a downward lead from stock index futures. Later in the session,
the futures contract settled comfortably above the 3,100 mark, thus
underwriting the market at that level, for the time being at least.
The general absence of enthusiasm opened the way for profit-taking in those
sectors which have performed well in recent weeks. Media stocks, in
particular, gave ground in relatively narrow markets.
Among the blue chips, dollar stocks found little to encourage them until the
very end of the session. Oil shares made little response to the continued
firmness in crude oil prices as the Nigerian supply stoppage showed no signs
of solution.
Although Wellcome continued to respond favourably to last week's trading
statement, other pharmaceutical stocks remained nervous, as investors
assessed the signs of tightening competition in the drugs industry.
Bank stocks, although generally expected to benefit from the improved
trading results confidently expected this week, slipped lower yesterday as
investors took their lead from the German stock market where financial
issues suffered further losses. A lead for the market is likely to come from
the interim statement due from ICI on Thursday. The market expects a good
increase in profits from ICI, which is still, in spite of the sale of the
pharmaceuticals divisions, regarded as an important leader of industrial
Britain.

FT  26 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow edges up in lacklustre
trading session
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US share prices edged higher yesterday in a lacklustre session highlighted
by the second-quarter results of the leading US energy groups, writes Frank
McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 6.80 better at 3,741.84, while the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 1.14 at 454.25. Volume on
the Big Board was a light 211m shares.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was up 0.61 at 434.06,
and the Nasdaq composite added 0.20 to 716.88.
The restrained tone which had dominated trading last week carried over to
yesterday's opening. Prices opened firmer but failed to make much headway,
with the market held in check by renewed uncertainty over the timing of the
Federal Reserve's next move to tighter money.
With Mr Alan Greenspan's recent warning on interest rates still ringing in
the ears of equity investors, the market looked for inspiration elsewhere
and came up empty. Activity in the bond market was as non-committal as in
stocks, and there was but a shred of second-tier economic guidance on offer.
The National Association of Realtors announced that sales of existing homes
last month had dropped 3.6 per cent. The news, while was nominally
supportive of a scenario which sees the Fed delaying its next strike on
rates, was merely shrugged off.
Instead, Wall Street concentrated on further news on how the corporate
sector fared during the second quarter. The overall impression was not
particularly favourable, but few stocks were hit hard.
Wall Street was, however, disappointed with the big oil groups, which
reported their downstream profit margins had come under pressure as crude
prices climbed during the second quarter. Among the companies publishing
their results, Mobil closed down Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 84 3/8 and Texaco
was unchanged at Dollars 63. But Exxon added Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 58 1/4 ,
even though its results fell short of expectations.
By contrast, Black &amp; Decker surprised analysts by posting
better-than-expected earnings of 24 cents, up from 20 cents in the
year-earlier period. The tool maker's stock was marked up Dollars 1 1/4 to
Dollars 18 3/4 .
Capital Cities/ABC appreciated Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 79 3/4 on its
announcement of net income of Dollars 1.23 a share, up from 92 cents a year
ago. CBS dipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 309 as the media group commenced a
programme to purchase 3.5m shares at Dollars 325.
Canada
Toronto stocks closed slightly lower in light trading with the the TSE-300
composite index slipping 7.77 points, or 0.19 per cent, to 4,168.39.
Declines led advances 399 to 315. Volume of 41.60m shares was below Friday's
56.13m shares and trading value was CDollars 465.0m compared with CDollars
470.4m.
American Barrick announced a bid, which it valued at CDollars 14 a share,
for all of Lac Minerals' outstanding shares. Barrick's shares lost CDollars
1 to CDollars 31 3/8 . Royal Oak Mines, which launched a bid for Lac earlier
this month, was up CDollars 1/4 to CDollars 5 7/8.

FT  26 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent is becalmed in
summer doldrums
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The high-summer doldrums begun to take their toll yesterday. Madrid was
closed for a public holiday.
MILAN, however, was once again unsettled by news of the arrests for alleged
corruption and the raid on the offices of Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest
group.
The Comit index gave up 4.36 to 726.09 in light trade as profits were taken
after last week's rally.
JP Morgan, enthusiastic about the outlook for the Italian market before the
general election, has reduced its target for the market for this year and
next, and has cut its weighting from overweight to neutral.
Mr Gary Dugan and Mr Hark Howdle said that the lack of explicit commitment
to any meaningful structural change in last week's budget, and the
increasing squabbles within the coalition government, had led them to reduce
their BCI-30 targets from 190 to 175 at the end of this year and from 210 to
200 by the end of 1995. The index stood at 169.74 yesterday.
Mr Dugan added that frictions within the coalition might, at the very least,
delay the progress of necessary reform. He would have expected Mr Silvio
Berlusconi to push the pace, but for now, the prime minister had lost some
political power following his climbdown on the penal law decree last week,
while the political developments over the weekend had served to compound the
problems.
Industrial stocks consolidated last week's gains with Fiat easing L20 to
L7,010 and Olivetti L30 easier at L2,540.
Telecommunications issues were harder hit with Sip giving up L70 to L4,517
and Stet losing L111 or 2 per cent to L5,497.
PARIS was lifted by a rally in the bond market, but with turnover down to
just FFr2bn there was little excitement about.
The CAC-40 index rose 18.43 to 2,059.84, on the first day of the new
account, as futures broke through a resistance level.
Analysts noted that the last account period had been the first positive one
since January - over the calendar month the CAC rose 7 per cent and 6 per
cent on the trading month.
Mr Michael Woodcock of Nikko Europe noted that the main factor affecting
sentiment was the dollar.
EuroDisney fell to FFr10, down FFr1.70, in volume of some 8m shares, as
arbitrage between rights and shares intensified.
FRANKFURT fell during official hours as some profit-taking emerged following
the gains of last week. The Dax index ended off 14.04 at 2,136.22.
In the Ibis there was a modest gain to 2,144.41.
Turnover was DM6bn.
In an analysis of the market written before last Thursday's Buba meeting
Robert Fleming Securities said that the banking sector would continue to be
held back by capital market losses 'and by the hangover of growing the loan
book strongly during the recession. Both consumer and construction sectors
face an uphill struggle in the medium term, and we would remain cautious.'
Among the day's activity Daimler rose against the trend, up DM14 at DM786,
helped, brokers said, by the positive statement from its Mercedes unit on
Friday.
Among groups due to report results tomorrow Deutsche Bank fell DM4 to
DM728.50, Commerzbank DM4 to DM337.50 and Allianz DM43 to DM2,472.
ZURICH was mixed in quiet trade, and the SMI index finished 2.0 higher at
2,601.2, supported by strength in pharmaceuticals and cyclicals.
Ciba registered shares, seen as cheap compared with others in the sector,
put on SFr17 to SFr798 while Roche certificates overcame some early weakness
to finish SFr25 higher at SFr5,545.
Among cyclicals, Alusuisse rose SFr12 to SFr682.
BRUSSELS, encouraged by news that the government had reached agreement over
the 1995 budget, saw the Bel-20 index lift 12.74 to 1,445.80.
Turnover was BFr1.2bn.
Some analysts remarked that overall strength was helped by the dollar, a
rise in the bond market and optimism over the success of budget talks.
Solvay and Bekaert featured, the former gaining BFr275 to BFr14,475 and the
latter BFr450 to BFr27,100.
STOCKHOLM was little changed although there was some selling in Ericsson
shares.
The Affarsvarlden general index sliped 0.7 to 1,465.0.
Ericsson's B share dropped SKr8 to SKr401 in active trading. Profit-taking
in the stock was seen, together with negative domestic comment.
Turnover dropped to SKr1.27bn from SKr1.58bn.
Volvo rose SKr10 to SKr745 on speculation that it found a buyer for all or
parts of its subsidiary Branded Consumer Products.
Forest sector shares continued to outperform, bolstered by the weak
currency, earnings expectations and expectations of product price increases.
The sector index rose 1.4 per cent with Stora up SKr7 to SKr417 and SCA up
SKr4 to SKr120.
OSLO finished marginally weaker as profit-taking eroded early gains inspired
by the results from Norsk Hydro. The All Share index dipped 1.33 to 641.95
in turnover of NKr487m.
Norsk finished NKr1 higher at NKr251, after an early NKr257.50, in response
to its better than expected second quarter results.
COPENHAGEN was grounded by the summer lull, the Top 20 KFX index slipping
0.37 to 107.96 in low turnover dominated by the banks. Den Danske Bank
slipped DKr5 to SKr354 and UniDanmark eased DKr4 to SDr241. TeleDanmark was
the most heavily traded issue, giving up DKr4 to DKr318.

<TEXT>
Local investors in the Nordic markets, who traditionally take summer
holidays earlier than their southern European counterparts, are returning to
work to find that the bourses have been putting in strong performances,
albeit in low turnover. The Nordic countries were among the best performers
over the last week, and month, as they continued to pick up after their
uncertain performances earlier in the year. In addition, Denmark saw a
strong performance by banks, helped by a rising bond market, while foreign
analysts have also proved enthusiastic about the outlook for TeleDanmark and
DDL, the Danish part of SAS. Sweden witnessed foreign demand for Volvo,
while Outokupu and Nokia were the driving force behind Finland's
improvement. Norway had high expectations, in the event justified, of
yesterday's results from Norsk Hydro. Mr Richard Lilley of Unibank commented
that the figures were likely to confirm that positive tone as investors
turned their attention to next month's raft of half-yearly corporate
figures.

FT  26 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls to 2-month
low on arbitrage selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Share prices fell on arbitrage selling prompted by lower futures prices and
profit-taking by overseas investors, and the Nikkei average closed at a
two-month low, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 issue index closed down 165.23 at 20,297.66 after a high of
20,427.39 and a low of 20,224.04. The Topix index of all first section
stocks declined 16.07 to 1,621.79 while the Nikkei 300 lost 2.77 to 293.76.
Declines led advances by 839 to 167, with 170 issues remaining unchanged.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was down 1.65 at 1,307.88.
The dollar's fall against the yen following last week's brief recovery,
discouraged dealers. Overseas investors also placed sell orders to lock in
profits from the high yen.
Volume was low at 226m shares against 278m. Fears that the dollar will
remain under the Y100 level against the Japanese currency bought about
prospects of falling profits at the leading exporters. 'Worries over the yen
are weighing on the thin market,' said a Japanese broker.
High-technology blue chips were hit by selling. NEC fell Y30 to Y1,170 and
Mitsubishi Electric lost Y22 to Y677. Consumer electronics companies were
also weaker with Sony down Y160 to Y5,790 and Pioneer Electronic declining
Y150 to Y2,760.
Brokers were down on profit concerns due to the recent decline in stock
market activity. Nomura Securities fell Y80 to Y2,240 while smaller brokers,
which are more vulnerable to falls in stock trading commissions, declined.
Marusan Securities sank Y80 to Y1,140 and New Japan Securities retreated Y55
to Y840.
Nissan Motor fell Y57 to Y750. Aside from the higher yen, investors were
also discouraged by reports that the company will need to recheck 700,000
vehicles following a government guidance to curb suspected carbon monoxide
leakages.
Meanwhile, some individual investors dabbled in speculative favourites.
Sugar refiners rose in the morning session on a cancer drug developed by
Ensuiko Sugar Refining on the second section. However, later profit-taking
eroded the gains and the stock closed down Y110 at Y1,900 while Mitsui Sugar
dropped Y17 to Y595.
Some retailers were higher on the rebound in consumption. Mitsukoshi rose
Y10 to Y1,030 and Tokyu Department Store gained Y16 to Y806.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 233.14 to 22,686.74 in volume of 56m shares.
Roundup
Market activity was mixed yesterday.
HONG KONG rose slightly after moving within a narrow range ahead of today's
government land auction.
The Hang Seng index added 21.63 to 9,174.62 in turnover of HKDollars 2.6bn
against Friday's HKDollars 2.7bn.
HSBC Holdings topped the active list, rising 25 cents to HKDollars 89.75
against the day's high of HKDollars 90.75. Hang Seng Bank fell 25 cents to
HKDollars 53.75.
Bank of East Asia, depressed by its poorer-than-expected interim profits,
eased 30 cents, or 1 per cent, to HKDollars 31.40.
profits.
Sincere fell 17 cents to HKDollars 2.01 after reporting an 89 per cent drop
in annual profits.
SINGAPORE was stronger on bargain-hunting, with a late round of buying
support for blue-chip issues from overseas investors. The Straits Times
Industrial index put on 13.04 to 2,212.26, slightly off the session high of
2,214.5. Brokers said that sentiment was assisted by renewed buying interest
from overseas investors.
Cycle and Carriage rose 20 cents to SDollars 11.20 dlrs, Fraser and Neave
put on 20 cents to SDollars 16.80 dlrs and City Development 10 cents to
SDollars 6.65. SEOUL dropped on widespread selling of blue chips. The
composite index dipped 11.46 to 939.12.
Among the risers Kukje continued to perform in anticipation of better
performances as a result of diversification. It went limit up, gaining
Won210 to Won9,610 in volume of 1.3m shares.
TAIPEI closed higher as lower-priced stocks that had lagged recent rallies
began to surge. The weighted index increased 131.77 or 2 per cent to
6,688.00, its highest level since on June 6, 1990. Turnover was TDollars
107.7bn.
Buying appeared in lower-priced electronics stocks while, among financials,
ICBC gained the daily seven per cent limit, rising TDollars 6 to TDollars
98.
MANILA rose sharply on expectations of good second quarter results due out
soon.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Markets watch Quebec
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The announcement that the Canadian province of Quebec goes to the polls on
September 12 yesterday provided a distraction from the market's recent
pre-occupation with the dollar, writes Philip Gawith.
Apart from focusing attention on Canadian economic fundamentals, it has also
forced investors to consider the implications of a victory by the separatist
Parti Quebecois, which is favoured to win.
The Canadian dollar initially opened weaker on the news, but later recovered
to finish in London at CDollars 1.3786 against the US dollar, from CDollars
1.3782 on Friday.
The US dollar traded in a fairly narrow range, with markets waiting for the
release on Friday of the second quarter GDP estimate. Against the D-Mark, it
closed at DM1.5849 from DM1.576. Against the yen, it closed at Y98.75 from
Y98.6850.
Trading on the foreign exchanges was, in general, very quiet with an absence
of data or events to help the market rise above mid-summer torpor. In
Europe, the D-Mark turned in a mixed performance. It finished slightly lower
against the French franc at FFr3.417 from FFr3.421.
Amid a market holiday in Spain and thin trade, the Portuguese escudo was
fixed at midday at Es102.572, its highest fixing since April 22.
Sterling also had a quiet day with no news to trade off and no fresh lead
from the dollar which has set the scene for the pound in recent weeks. It
closed at DM2.4315 against the D-Mark from DM2.4231. Against the dollar, it
finished at Dollars 1.5342 from Dollars 1.5375.
The CBI's industrial trends survey today will be closely watched for
information about price expectations and capacity utilisation which could
influence the monthly monetary meeting later this week.
The Parti Quebecois in Canada is committed to hold a referendum on secession
within 10 months if it wins the election. Although opinion polls suggest
that the people of Quebec are not yet ready to secede, there are rumblings
that richer states like Alberta and British Columbia might break away.
While these scenarios remain highly speculative in the short-term, they are
likely to unsettle the currency during the election campaign. Already
Canadian interest rates include a substantial risk premium and the Canadian
dollar has remained the weakest of the G7 currencies.
Allied to political uncertainty have been fears about the size of the budget
deficit. Chase Manhattan bank estimates that the central government budget
deficit to be 6.3 per cent of GDP in 1994. Against this, however, must be
set a commendable inflation record which has actually seen recent falls in
year-on-year consumer prices, and benefits to be had from rising commodity
prices.
Despite these, analysts do not rule out a re-testing of the all-time low of
CDollars 1.445/USDollars ahead of the election, with a possible recovery to
CDollars 1.30 in the following twelve months. The Canadian currency was
trading at CDollars 1.32 at the beginning of the year.
Two factors which bore on sentiment towards the dollar were fears that the
German interest rate cycle might have bottomed, and the resurgence of the
US-Japan trade dispute.
Professor Herbert Hax, one of the German government's most senior economic
advisers, said over the weekend that further cuts in German interest rates
were unnecessary.
With the Sunday deadline for progress in US - Japan trade procurement talks,
markets have again started to worry about the dollar becoming a casualty of
lack of progress in these discussions.
Mr Peter Luxton, economist at Barclays in London, said the dollar was likely
to trade in a narrow range ahead of Friday's GDP data. The data is seen as a
key indicator for Fed policy, but the wide range of estimates has left the
market uncertain about the dollar's next move.
In the absence of other things to think about, the start today of Whitewater
hearings before the House banking committee could cause the dollar to
weaken. Whitewater refers to a set of real estate transactions in Arkansas
where President Clinton and his wife have been linked to alleged
improprieties.
The dollar received a fillip from comments from US commerce secretary Mr Ron
Brown that the US wanted to see resolution in all areas of trade with Japan.
German call money remained firm at 4.85/4.95 per cent as banks started to
consider the implications of an impending fixed rate repo tender, with the
rate set at 4.85 per cent for the next four tenders. There are fears that
banks' cash requirements will only be partially met.
The Bank of England provided Pounds 309m assistance to UK money markets
after forecasting a Pounds 700m shortage. Overnight money traded between 4
3/4 and 6 1/2 per cent.
Trade in the futures markets was very quiet. The December eurosterling
contract closed at 93.88 from 93.91, while the December euromark contract
finished unchanged at 95.01. The December eurodollar contract retreated
slightly from 94.15 on Friday to finish at 94.09.

<TEXT>
Coffee futures yesterday suffered a sharp setback in New York and London as
selling by disillusioned speculators ran into a lack of buying interest on
the eve of the first Brazilian government estimates of the frost damage to
next year's crop.
In London, the second position robusta contract dropped Dollars 245 to
Dollars 3,383 a tonne, leaving it about Dollars 300 above its level just
before the second Brazilian frost two weeks ago and 17 per cent below its 8
1/2 -year peak of Dollars 4,085 in the week following that frost.
The New York market, which is more driven by speculative interest and trades
in arabica, Brazil's primary coffee variety, has seen an even larger
retracement of about 25 per cent from its peak of 274 cents a pound on July
13. In afternoon trading yesterday, the September contract was off 13.20
cents at 206.20 cents a pound.
The belief is growing that the crop damage will be less than initially
thought from the two severe frosts which struck in late June and early July.
'With the benefit of hindsight, a lot of the ideas put around before are now
seen as having been too much too soon,' said Mr Robert MacArthur, head of
the tropical trader group at Merrill Lynch in London.
He said estimates of damage of between 6m and 9m bags to a crop that could
have been 25m-30m bags were now widely believed and had been discounted in
prices. 'If Brazil only confirms that, it won't be enough to do much to the
market. If it's significantly higher, people might be disbelieving.'
He added that more physical supplies had come on to the market and coffee
roasters and traders had better cover than during the scramble that followed
the second frost.
ED &amp; F. Man, the London commodity trader, said yesterday that a loss of 6m
to 8m bags could mean a crop only a little smaller than this year's harvest
of around 24m.
GNI, the London brokers, took a similar line. 'We believe that the final
crop figure will come in close to 20m bags,' it said in its daily market
report.
Yesterday's falls, in fairly thin volume, were fuelled by warmer weather
during the weekend. Both previous frosts took place at the weekend, and the
potential frost season continues until the end of next month.
One London trader commented: 'The real problem is that no one is sure where
the market should be.'
Zimbabwe has lost up to 20 per cent of its expected coffee output of 7,800
tonnes this season because of frost, reports Reuters from Harare.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian growers get better
bargain - Newly-authorised private auctions are flourishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Indian government is progressively reducing the marketing role of the
Coffee Board, which until a couple of years ago used to pool the country's
entire production for auctioning. As part of a general economic
liberalisation plan the Coffee Act of 1942 has been changed to allow growers
to market half their production independent of the Board in either the
domestic or foreign market.
There is a consensus among all concerned that liberalisation - to start
with, the growers were allowed to sell 30 per cent of their produce in the
domestic market only - has done a world of good to the plantation industry.
Even though the buyers of coffee for the domestic market are complaining
loudly about 'runaway' inflation in coffee prices at the auction since
January, they admit that the planters have started taking a lot more care
about the quality of the crop.
When the board was pooling the crop 'the estates did not have any individual
identity', says an official of the Karnataka Planters Association.
'Moreover, the return from coffee was so low prior. . . that the growers had
neither the money nor the incentive to care for quality.'
But with the Indian Coffee Trade Association holding fortnightly auction at
Bangalore, where returns depend on quality, the estate owners are giving a
lot more attention to irrigation, use of nutrients and plucking and curing
of berries.
The success of the ICTA auction has encouraged producers and traders to
organise monthly auction at Coorg in Karnataka and Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu.
While the - a big incentive to producers being the prompt payment they
receive - the board, which holds a weekly auction at Bangalore, is not
getting enough coffee, although growers are required to surrender half their
production to it. The Board takes an inordinately long time to pay for the
pooled coffee and the premium for good quality is insufficient.
According to the Board, India's 1993-94 (October to September) coffee crop
will be 208,000 tonnes, comprising 119,500 tonnes of robusta and 88,500
tonnes of the milder arabica. The board should, therefore, be getting
104,000 tonnes of coffee from the growers. But the amount received so far is
less than 50,000 tonnes.
The growers think that India will finish the season with a crop of 180,000
tonnes, up from 169,395 tonnes in 1992-93.
It is mainly the small growers with holdings of up to ten hectares - they
own nearly 64 per cent of the 270,821 hectares under coffee - who are not
surrendering the required quantity. And the board lacks the means of
enforcing discipline. Mr Ashok Kuriyan, himself a big planter and president
of ICTA, suggests that instead of 'encouraging corrupt practices, the
government should exempt the small growers from pooling coffee with the
board'.
The plantation owners argue that as the private auctions are doing well with
enthusiastic participation by the growers, traders and exporters, the
government should now allow them to market the entire crop. But the
authorities will have to take into account the growing discontent among the
Indian consumers over the rising coffee prices and the demand for a separate
coffee auction for the domestic market before it thinks of further
liberalising the trade.
The small growers' action committee does not believe that separate auction
sales for the domestic market will give any relief to consumers 'since as
long as the world coffee prices remain higher than the domestic prices,
coffee will somehow be cornered by the exporters. The return to the dual
auction system will only breed corruption'.
The growers, irrespective of size, point out that for the first time in many
years they are getting a good return from coffee. They say that the
surpluses are being used to pay back loans, create irrigation facilities and
start the process of replanting bushes, many of which are 50 to 60 years
old. They realise that their present prosperity is a reflection of the world
coffee situation. If the government wants to give relief to vulnerable
sections of society, they argue, it should take some coffee from the board
for distribution through ration shops. The elimination of middlemen would
make such coffee cheaper by at least 20 per cent, they claim.
With Indian coffee inviting strong export enquiries, the growers think that
exports in this financial year (April to March) will be much higher than the
125,172 tonnes shipped in 1993-94.

higher than thought

<TEXT>
Russian aluminium exports outside the Commonwealth of Independent States
rose to 1.116m tonnes in the first half of this year from 673,600 tonnes in
the corresponding period a year earlier, according to the Foreign Economic
Relations Ministry, reports Reuters from Moscow.
Aluminium exports in January-May were 978,200 tonnes, up from 495,800 tonnes
in the year-ago period, a ministry official said.
The official, who declined to be named, said an initial January-June
estimate of 1.25m tonnes had been revised. The latter figure was published
by the State Statistics Office in its latest report on the economy.
An official of Aluminiy the country's aluminium producers' group declined to
comment on the figures.
Russia and other major world aluminium producers agreed earlier this year to
cut output in a bid to prop up the market. The agreement was in response to
a sharp fall in aluminium prices caused by a surge in Russian exports
following the breaking up of the Soviet Union. Prices have since risen
strongly.
Data released at a meeting of the producers in Australia this month showed
that Russian output fell to 220,800 tonnes in June from 236,100 in November
1993. That data also indicated, however, that exports in the first five
months of this year amounted to about 800,000 tonnes, roughly in line with
the 1993 total of 1.9m tonnes.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Wool industry 'emerging from
crisis'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Australia's wool industry is just pulling out of a crisis that lasted for
the past three years, according to Mr Barry Jackson, managing director of
the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation. A collapse in price
led the country's 70,000 growers to run up debts of ADollars 2.8bn.
In 1991, following the withdrawal of a reserve price scheme by the
Australian government, prices dropped to 348 cents a kilogram but have since
climbed back to 600 cents. Production declined because of the downturn in
price, bringing the market closer to equilibrium.
In a talk to the Australian Business in Europe forum, Mr Jackson said that
last year was the fourth in which sales had exceeded output, which meant
that the government's stockpile of 4.5m bales of wool was being eroded. He
said the stockpile and producers' debts which now stood at ADollars 1.2bn
should be eliminated in three to four years.
'We've gone from being a very conservative, producer-orientated industry to
being much more market and consumer- related,' Mr Jackson said.
Australia's wool organisation co-ordinates research and development work for
growers. It has also recently taken over the direction of the International
Wool Secretariat which is based in Ilkley in Yorkshire but for which
Australia provides 85 per cent of the funds.
The secretariat will be moved to Melbourne, where Mr Jackson plans to
rebuild reserves and start advertising wool to consumers again. 'Competition
is against cotton and synthetics, not wool from other countries,' he said.
Wool accounts for between 7 and 10 per cent of Australia's exports at a
value of ADollars 3 to ADollars 4bn a year.
Mr Jackson is keen to pitch wool as a quality product and not just a
commodity. Wool accounts for just 4 per cent of world fibre output which is
dominated by cotton and synthetic fibres and although world demand is
growing, production is constrained by limitation of space for keeping sheep.

Most base metal markets finished higher on the London Metal Exchange

COPPER tended to stutter higher, with periods of upward movement and
option-related buying followed by spells of torpor.
ALUMINIUM was helped by late commission house buying, which ensured a close

buying below Dollars 1,500 had run its course.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK scientists in search for
'greener' dairying system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British researchers are investigating whether dairy farming can be both
profitable and environment-friendly.
The government's farm advisory service, Adas, is examining ways of reducing
the waste products and emissions from dairy farms, such as nitrogen run-off
and manure or slurry. Project managers have set up three dairy systems at
Adas's Bridgets research centre in Hampshire to compare the results of
different types of management.
Disposing of slurry in a way that is not harmful to the environment is a
controversial issue in the European Union where it is tackled by different
countries in different ways. In Denmark, farmers must own enough land to
dispose of their own slurry or must be able to secure contracts from their
neighbours to get rid of it on their land.
The British government is looking at the possibility of introducing
legislation that would force farmers to store the slurry for a period and
dispose of it when it was least likely to be harmful to the environment.
This would raise costs for farmers, but it would also bring some benefits as
the land gets more nutrients from manure if it is spread done in the winter.
The experimental dairy units range from a conventional system with a
stocking rate of 2.1 cows a hectare to a farm with the same amount of land
and number of animals but which has incorporated measures for reducing
nitrate losses.
The third unit includes more land with the same number of cows so that
nitrate leaching losses can be cut to below the European Union limit of 50
milligrammes a litre.
Mr Steven Peel who runs the project, which has received a Pounds 700,000
grant from the government, says the profitability of the different systems
will be studied for three years to see if environmental management can be
improved without affecting profits.
At the same time, the researchers are looking at the use of forage maize for
cows' diets as a replacement for silage, which will help to reduce the
amount of nitrogen they excrete. Feed can be formulated in a way that
eliminates excess nitrogen.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Government Bonds: Longer-dated US Treasuries gain ground

<TEXT>
Longer-dated US Treasury bonds gained ground in thin trading yesterday
although many traders were staying on the sidelines ahead of this week's
supply auctions.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  13/32 better
at 85 1/32 with the yield slipping to 7.519 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was unchanged at 99 25/32 , to yield 6.101 per cent.
The lack of movement on prices for shorter-dated paper reflected the
approach of the Treasury's sale of Dollars 17.25bn in two-year notes this
afternoon, followed by Dollars 11bn in five-year securities tomorrow.
The auctions come at a time of renewed uncertainty over the timing of the
Federal Reserve's next move to lift short-term interest rates.
Yesterday's economic news was not compelling enough to dispel the listless
mood. The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing
single-family homes fell 3.6 per cent last month, a slightly weaker reading
than forecast. The data added to recent evidence that the housing sector had
begun to cool.
European bonds ended a trendless session firmer, supported partly by the
stronger tone in US Treasuries. But volume continued to decline and investor
activity dried to a trickle.
UK gilts ended the day slightly firmer and are expected to track
neighbouring markets until tomorrow's auction of 6.25 per cent gilts due
2010.
Mr Andrew Roberts, gilts analyst at UBS, expects the auction to go well for
several reasons. For one, he cites core demand for long-dated paper by UK
investors. Moreover, although the Bank of England will auction a nominal
Pounds 2bn of gilts, he points out that only Pounds 1.6bn in market terms is
being issued as the paper trades at a deep discount to its nominal value; in
late trading, the bonds were quoted at 82 15/32 .
Furthermore, Mr Roberts argues, 'the new paper will be perfectly placed to
become a new 15-year benchmark.' Since the 8 per cent gilt due 2009 will
drop out of the over 15-year bond index in September, the new bond will be
left as the shortest bond in the index.
French bonds put on a strong performance, rising by nearly a point in
largely technical, futures-led trading.
Traders said a large buy order of the September notional bond future on
Matif, executed by a leading futures broker in Paris, and US buying pushed
prices through key technical resistance.
The contract rose by 0.86 points on the day to 117.62. The 10-year yield
spread over bunds narrowed by about 7 basis points to 41 basis points.
Buoyant French bonds supported German bunds, which ended the day about half
a point higher. Trading was technical and the market largely shrugged off
regional inflation data and news that the Treuhandanstalt privatisation
agency plans to issue more bonds this year than forecast.
The September bund future on Liffe rose 0.47 point to 94.03.
Italian market sentiment was shaken by renewed political concerns, but
prices were pulled higher by neighbouring markets and late short-covering in
the futures markets. The Italian BTP future on Liffe rose by around 0.51
points to 104.03.

FT  26 JUL 94 / International Bonds: Dutch bank launches benchmark DM deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BNG, the Dutch municipal finance bank, yesterday pushed on with its strategy
of establishing benchmark issues in non-guilder currencies with the launch
of a DM750m offering of five-year eurobonds.
Last week, the bank launched a Dollars 1bn five-year eurobond offering, its
first benchmark since it was awarded triple-A debt ratings one month ago.
Joint lead manager Goldman Sachs said this policy was the best way of
appealing to a wide variety of investors.
However, syndicate managers said that, in spite of the attractive spread of
27 basis points over five-year German government bonds and the bank's strong
following with European retail investors, the deal was too large given
current demand. They added that institutional investors were unwilling to
buy D-Mark bonds ahead of tomorrow's auction of five-year bonds by Treuhand,
the German privatisation agency.
Sears, Roebuck, the US retailing and insurance group, is planning to launch
a global, asset-backed issue of around Dollars 1bn in the next month. The
securitised offering will be backed by the company's credit card
receivables, worth Dollars 20.4bn.
CS First Boston has been mandated to lead-manage the triple-A rated issue,
which could be the first in a series. The company is planning to file a
shelf with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which could cover
several years of issuance.
Fixed-rate funding currently accounts for 86 per cent of the company's
borrowing. 'In the next year or so this will be closer to 75 per cent,' said
Ms Alice Peterson, company treasurer. This would be a comfortable mix given
the current capital market environment.
Bayerische Landesbank launched a Y30bn three-year bond issue yesterday amid
rumours that the European Investment Bank may tap the euroyen market soon.
Syndicate managers expect a Y50bn to Y100bn three-year issue from the EIB,
to come either today or after this week's auction of 10-year Japanese
government bonds.
Moody's has downgraded the long and short-term ratings of Credit Lyonnais,
the troubled French bank, to A3 and P2 respectively from A1 and P1. Both
ratings have been on review for possible downgrade since February. Around
Dollars 13bn of long-term debt is affected.

Sydney

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Chicago Board of Trade and the Sydney Futures Exchange are studying the
technical feasibility of joining their after-hours trading systems. The move
could be the first step towards a new global futures alliance.
The announcement comes a week after the CBoT and the London International
Financial Futures and Options Exchange agreed to a similar study to find an
alternative to Globex, the electronic trading system developed by Reuters.
By linking with the Australian exchange, the CBoT would gain a clear
foothold for its after hours system - known as Project A - in the Asian time
zone. Any link would be at least a 12 months in development, the exchanges
said.
The after-hours trading strength of the Sydney Futures Exchange lies in its
government bond futures and options contract. Globex, which currently
consists of an alliance between the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the
Matif of France and the DTB of Germany, specialises chiefly in short-term
interest rate and foreign currency contracts.
The CME has a mutual offset link with Singapore International Monetary
Exchange, but Globex itself lacks an exchange partner in the Asian region.
The Sydney-Chicago exploratory study is widely seen as another indication
that the concept of linking existing proprietary trading systems is more
appealing than the co-management of a single system, which is the way Globex
is structured.
Under the broad outlines of the CBoT-Liffe plan, the CBoT would retain its
existing trading technology as well as control of trading and clearing
functions for its own contracts.
The growing number of strategic alliances between futures exchanges has
raised the stakes for futures exchanges around the world. However, both
Liffe and the CBoT have a number of failed trading agreements behind them.

FT  26 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: US metals group in
silver-linked share issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Freeport-McMoRan has raised Dollars 100m through a silver-linked depositary
share offering totalling 4.75m units.
The shares were priced last Friday at Dollars 21.01, roughly four times the
London fixing price for one ounce of silver. That day, the London price was
Dollars 5.2525 per ounce. Dividends on the silver-denominated preferred
shares, payable quarterly, have been set at 4.125 per cent per depositary
share.
The shares, which have a 12-year maturity, are listed on the New York Stock
Exchange.
Freeport, a US-based metals and diversified company, has previously issued
two gold-linked depositary shares, but this was the first silver-linked deal
ever launched.
According to a syndicate official at lead manager Lehman Brothers, the issue
was oversubscribed, boosted by expectations of rising silver prices.
'The deal was driven primarily by dedicated natural resources and commodity
funds, but also met with good interest from retail investors,' said Mr Hank
Erbe, syndicate manager at Lehman Brothers, adding that some 75 per cent of
the deal was bought by US-based investors.
'The structure combines the attractiveness of silver with the liquidity of a
New York Stock Exchange listing,' said Mr Erbe. 'In addition, the shares
carry a very competitive dividend yield.'
Although the price of silver has recently been in decline, commodities
analysts expect it to rebound towards Dollars 6 per ounce in coming months.
At its height in the 1980s it traded at around Dollars 50.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Austria Mikro Systeme International (AMS), a specialised computer chip
manufacturer, has become the first company in Austria to be completely
privatised following the sale of the state's remaining 26 per cent holding.
According to Kleinwort Benson, which acted as international agent, Austria
raised Dollars 25.2m through the private placement of 450,000 AMS shares at
Sch608 each to domestic and international institutional investors. It also
sold 75,000 shares to employees and 125,000 shares to a private, foreign
investor for an undisclosed sum.
Kleinwort Benson said the institutional tranche was over three times
subscribed and the bulk went to international investors. A portion of the
shares was placed in the US under Rule 144a. Yesterday AMS shares closed at
Sch640 in Vienna, up Sch10 from Friday.
The initial public offering for AMS was completed one year ago when 74 per
cent of its equity was sold to international and domestic investors. It was
the first sale of a majority shareholding by Austria.

Kalamazoo Holdings' chairman and biggest shareholder, Mr Fred Street, said
he planned to sell his 40.2 per cent stake in the Australian office supplies

ADollars 2.05 a share for the company, Reuter reports from Sydney.
Although Kalamazoo directors described Avatar's ADollars 103m (USDollars

accept the offer in the interests of his family and related parties.
On the Australian stock exchange, Kalamazoo shares closed at ADollars 2.10,
down 10 cents, and Avatar's unchanged at ADollars 1.14. Kalamazoo said it
was advising shareholders not to accept the offer.

<TEXT>
Taiwan Cement saw first-half pre-tax profits drop 29 per cent to NTDollars
1.77bn (USDollars 66m) compared with a year ago, due to a continued slump in
the construction industry and a sharp fall in non-operating income, writes
Laura Tyson in Taipei. Sales in the half year to June 30 were down 5.8 per
cent to NTDollars 9.17bn.
Analysts attributed the decline to increased cement imports and slack
demand, partly due to delays in public infrastructure construction projects.
After the shutdown next month of a large Kaohsiung plant for environmental
reasons, Taiwan Cement will fall to second place behind Asia Cement in terms
of production capacity, analysts said.

FT  26 JUL 94 / International Company News: Thais shell out for shrimp
venture - Steven Chia hopes to supply chitin products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Steven Chia is euphoric about his latest shrimp venture. 'Chitin,' he
said at his office in Bangkok, 'looks like a miracle product'.
Extracted from the shells of shrimps and crabs, chitin is a cellulose-like
substance with diverse applications; its derivatives can be made into
surgical stitching thread that dissolves harmlessly in the flesh, or used to
separate heavy metals in water treatment plants, or sprayed on to fruit to
prevent moisture loss.
The potential worldwide demand for chitin products is estimated at more than
Dollars 1bn a year, but supply has been limited by difficulties in
extracting materials of the right quality and in sufficient quantities.
Mr Chia, managing director of Seafresh Industry (Thailand), one of the main
Thai shrimp exporters listed on the Thai stock exchange, sees this
unsatisfied demand as a chance to make money.
Seafresh, with plenty of shrimp shells at its disposal, has established a
Dollars 1m joint venture with Kitosan Laboratories of Malaysia to produce
about 100 tonnes of chitin a year; a typical price is Dollars 50 per kg
(although some grades command much higher premiums) and in the first year
alone Mr Chia is counting on net profits of Dollars 2m from the venture.
Whether it turns out to be miraculous or not, the Seafresh chitin investment
underlines the determination of Thai shrimp processing companies to add
value to their output as exports continue to grow.
This year Thai frozen shrimp exports are expected to rise by 10 per cent to
some 160,000 tonnes, valued at about Dollars 2bn. Shrimp is one of
Thailand's biggest exports after textiles and computer parts. Japan and the
US are the main buyers.
Thailand, the world's biggest shrimp exporter, has seen dollar prices
boosted by the strength of the yen and by a fall in Chinese production after
outbreaks of disease in Chinese shrimp farms.
Thai seafood companies and their shareholders are reaping the rewards.
'Foreign institutional investors tend to be a bit dubious about agribusiness
stocks because they are prone to cycles and earnings in the past have been
disappointing,' said one Bangkok-based stockbroker. 'It's only since late
last year that we've seen a pick-up in sales and that's now feeding through
into margins.'
But the volatility of shrimp prices still preoccupies Thai exporters,
especially when they face possible competition from new aquaculture ventures
in countries such as India and Vietnam.
Hence the urge to process the shrimp in Thailand: the prices of downstream
products for the retail market are not only higher but more stable than
those of basic frozen shrimp, and Thailand believes its skilled labour for
processing gives it a competitive advantage over new entrants to the market.
Methods of adding value range from boiling the shrimp to producing frozen
sushi for Japan. Seafresh, for example, adds value to more than half its
output, producing breaded shrimp for tempura and making spring rolls;
recently it began selling shrimp fried rice to South Korea.
Charoen Pokphand Feedmill, part of the multinational CP group, makes most of
its money from shrimpfeed, but also has a subsidiary exporting fried shrimps
in batter and skewered shrimps in barbecue sauce.
Surapon Seafoods, another seafood exporter, is switching some of its
production from unprocessed frozen shrimp to pre-cooked meals - including
meat and vegetables - for Japanese convenience stores. Other companies are
following the same road.
The most likely obstacle to the Thai shrimp industry's continued expansion
is the carrying capacity of the country's environment. Shrimp farms are
notoriously destructive - they usually replace the mangrove swamps where
fish breed - and prone to disease. They tend to be poisoned by their own
effluent and fail after a few years, as happened in Taiwan.
'A cynic would say it's getting near the end of the road for Thailand as far
as the shrimp industry goes,' said a stockbroker, who asked not to be named.
'They need new territory, long coastlines, clean water and preferably places
that are poor where they don't have very strong environmental rules.'
The CP group has already announced plans to invest an additional Dollars
100m in the shrimp and shrimpfeed business in India, and is also looking at
the possibility of investing in other countries such as Bangladesh and
Vietnam.
For the time being, however, the industry in Thailand is managing to stave
off disease and devise ever more sophisticated ways of packaging and
marketing its shrimp products.
Seafresh's project to make chitin and chitosan - chitin's main derivative -
is just the latest example of how Thai companies are making the most of
their shrimp.
Mr Chia says the new plant, to be operational in six months, will be able to
produce a range of grades demanded by buyers for everything from cosmetics
to loud speaker diaphragms (another application). 'We can tailor-make the
product the buyers need,' he says.

Coal &amp; Allied Industries, which is majority-owned by CRA, the Australian
mining group, yesterday reported an 86 per cent fall in after-tax profits to
ADollars 5.9m (Dollars 4.4m) in the six months to end-June. This compared
with ADollars 40.7m in the same period a year previously.
Operating profit after tax, but before abnormals, stood at ADollars 14.3m,
compared with ADollars 37.3m, while abnormals amounted to a ADollars 8.4m
loss, resulting from the restructuring of the open-cut mines. In the
previous year, there was an abnormal gain of ADollars 3.4m.
The company said total production in the six-month period was 5.1m tonnes,
down from 5.7m tonnes a year earlier, although part of the reduction was due
to the sale of certain operations. Reduced coal contract prices and the
stronger Australian dollar meant that sales for the half-year fell from
ADollars 334.5m to ADollars 283.4m.
Coal &amp; Allied said the still-lower coal prices negotiated with leading
Japanese buyers earlier this year and the stronger currency would mean that
profits remained under pressure in the short-term. However, 'increased
demand coupled with low stockpiles is expected to increase prices in the
next 12 months', it said.
The dividend was cut to 25 cents a share from 44 cents.

Lazard Brothers has signed an agreement with the BK Birla group, a leading
industrial business house, and Creditcapital Finance Corporation, Lazard's
Indian partners, to establish an overseas investment trust fund.
The Lazard Birla India Fund will raise money overseas for investments to be
made in Indian equities. 'The alliance between our group and Lazard Brothers
brings together for the first time, a large Indian industrial house and an
international investment banking group,' said Mr BK Birla, head of Birla
International.
'The strategic association between the BK Birla group and Lazard in the area
of asset management in Indian equities brings together the skills of the
Birla group and the Lazard-Creditcapital group in fund management,' said Mr
Udayan Bose, chairman of the Creditcapital Investment Banking Group and a
director of Lazard.
Creditcapital Finance, India's first international merchant bank, was set up
by Mr Bose in 1985, in a joint venture with Lazard. The Lazard houses own 40
per cent of Creditcapital Finance, the flagship of the Creditcapital
Investment Banking Group.

FT  26 JUL 94 / International Company News: France Telecom expected to seek
industrial links

A report by France Telecom, the French state-owned telecoms operator, is
expected to recommend the company's legal status be reformed to enable the
opening of its share capital to industrial partners.
The report, by Mr Marcel Roulet, France Telecom's chairman, is due to be
presented to Mr Gerard Longuet, the industry, telecommunications and foreign
trade minister, by the end of the week.
France Telecom declined to comment on details of the report, but it is
thought to support a government proposal to transform the operator into a
joint stock company, with its own capital, from its existing status as an
'autono-mous operator under public law'.
The change would allow France Telecom to exchange equity stakes with
industrial partners and enable the French government to reduce its holding
in the operator.
The state, however, would be expected to retain majority control.
Mr Longuet proposed last year that France Telecom's legal status be
reformed, partly to allow it to forge strategic alliances with other
telecoms companies and to prepare for the liberalisation of the European
telecoms market, which is due in 1998.
Resistance to the moves by employees at France Telecom - who feared the
reform would lead to privatisation, job cuts and the end of their semi-civil
servant status - prompted the postponement of the reform.
Mr Roulet has since conducted company-wide discussions to reassure the
operator's 154,000 staff.
Opening France Telecom's capital would allow the operator to cement its
industrial alliance with Deutsche Telekom. The alliance, which focuses on
services for large multinational business clients, was extended earlier this
year through a separate link with Sprint of the US.
The report also discusses the group's financial strategy. France Telecom is
pursuing a policy of debt reduction in an attempt to ease financial charges
and to free resources for expansion.
At the end of last year, total group borrowings were reduced to FFr105.6bn
(Dollars 19.4bn), compared with FFr111.6bn at the end of 1992.

FT  26 JUL 94 / International Company News: Sprint joins Iusacell in venture
</HEADLINE>

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sprint, the US telephone group, is joining up with Grupo Iusacell, a leading
Mexican cellular telecommunications company, to provide a long-distance
service in Mexico from January 1997.
Iusacell will own at least 51 per cent of the new company, and Sprint at
least 33 per cent. Bell Atlantic, the US Baby Bell, last year agreed to take
a 42 per cent in Iusacell for Dollars 1.04bn, and will indirectly own a
stake in the new venture.
The Iusacell-Sprint joint venture will first apply for regulatory approval
to provide long-distance services. The Mexican government has agreed to open
up the long-distance telephone market to competition from 1997, but has not
yet issued licences, nor established the requirements potential carriers
will have to meet.
However, Iusacell and Sprint expect to be given approval soon.
Last month the ministry of communications and transport agreed in principle
not to limit the number of long-distance carriers as part of the first step
in opening up the telecommunications sector.
Sprint's venture in Mexico follows a similar move by MCI, the second largest
US long-distance carrier, which earlier this year formed a Dollars 1bn
alliance with Grupo Financiero Banamex to provide long-distance services
from 1997. MCI will invest about Dollars 450m in the new company, taking a
45 per cent stake in it.
Sprint and MCI will be competing against Telefonos de Mexico, the current
monopoly provider, in which Southwestern Bell has a minority stake.
Telmex earned about Dollars 4bn from long-distance revenues last year,
Dollars 2.5bn from domestic long-distance and Dollars 1.5bn from
international. Mr John Cahill, vice-president of Sprint, said Mexico's
long-distance market could be worth Dollars 20bn by the end of the decade.
Sprint said the new Mexican company will advance its strategy of creating 'a
seamless North American network to handle the anticipated demand stemming
from the North American Free Trade Agreement'. Sprint already offers
long-distance services in Canada, in partnership with Call-Net, Canada's
largest alternative communications carrier.
Iusacell, which sold 9 per cent of its capital for Dollars 250m in an
initial public offering last month, is the non-Telmex cellular company in
central Mexico, with more than 150,000 subscribers.
The company is planning to offer a wireless local telephone service in
Mexico next year.

FT  26 JUL 94 / International Company News: Second-term profits up strongly
at Goodyear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Goodyear, the US tyre group, lifted net earnings in the second quarter by
more than 18 per cent to Dollars 163.2m, or Dollars 1.08 a share.
The result represents a solid improvement on the corresponding period of
1993, when profit was Dollars 137.6m, or 95 cents a share, excluding a
charge of Dollars 14.6m for the early retirement of debt.
The company sustained its earnings momentum despite the continued
sluggishness of the world economy, as reflected in its almost static top
line. In the second three months of the year, revenues inched ahead to
Dollars 3.05bn, up from Dollars 3bn in the year-earlier quarter. Unit sales
of tyres climbed 3 per cent, compared with a 12 per cent growth rate in the
first quarter of 1994.
Sales to unaffiliated customers in Europe, the company's second biggest
market outside the US, declined almost 4 per cent to Dollars 561.5m.
Conditions in Turkey were cited as particularly difficult. The downturn was
partly offset by modest gains in North America, Latin America and Asia.
Revenues in the US, up 1.6 per cent, grew at a more moderate rate than in
the first quarter, when North American motor vehicle output had expanded at
an exceptionally rapid pace. In Asia, sales surged 15.8 per cent as new
production capacity came on stream in Thailand.
For the six months to June 30, net income reached Dollars 279.2m or Dollars
1.85 a share, on revenues of Dollars 5.96bn. The figures compare with
profits of Dollars 138.4m, or 96 cents, on revenues of Dollars 5.81bn in the
first half of 1993.
Goodyear's stock closed down  7/8 at Dollars 35 1/2 in New York.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ED&amp;F Man, the international commodity trading and financial services group
which plans a UK stock market flotation in September, intends to buy the
outstanding shares in AHL, a specialist fund manager which uses quantitative
techniques to trade futures and currencies.
Mr Stanley Fink, Man's finance director, said yesterday the value of the
outstanding shares in AHL would be determined by Man's forthcoming
flotation, since it was proposing a share-for-share exchange. The flotation
is expected to value Man at about Pounds 450m (Dollars 697m).
'The exchange of the minority interest in AHL for shares in Man will enable
Michael Adam, David Harding and Martin Lueck, who currently own shares in
AHL, to participate in the flotation,' said Mr Fink.
Although AHL's price/earnings ratio is likely to be lower than Man's, Mr
Fink said Man would be paying close to 20 times more than it paid for its
original stake in AHL, to reflect the growth in the business.
When Man bought a 51 per cent stake in the trading adviser in 1989, AHL only
had about Dollars 30m under management. Man has since built up its holding
in AHL, which now has around Dollars 300m under management, to around two
thirds.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp rise in cigarette sales in the UK supported earnings at American
Brands, the US consumer products group, in the second quarter of the year.
The rise was largely due to timing factors, as the company's Gallagher
subsidiary maintained its claimed market share in the UK at 40 per cent.
Meanwhile, earnings from US cigarette sales, though continuing a partial
recovery from the effects of the price war begun last summer, were 23 per
cent lower than a year ago. The company recently reached agreement to sell
its American Tobacco subsidiary to BAT Industries for Dollars 1bn.
The increase in volumes in the UK of 44 per cent was due to 'distortions
caused by a change last year in the timing of the UK government's budget,'
said Mr William Alley, chairman and chief executive.
Operating income from non-US tobacco sales more than doubled, to Dollars
94m, on sales up 49 per cent to Dollars 1.2bn.
American Tobacco, meanwhile, saw operating income slide to Dollars 70m, on
sales of Dollars 406m (Dollars 419m a year ago.) Its volume gains of 15 per
cent in the quarter were slightly ahead of the industry average, resulting
in an increase in market share, the company said.
The volume growth was led by low-price brands, which rose 20 per cent, while
premium brands rose only 8 per cent.
With the benefit of a lower tax rate, down to 31.3 per cent from 36 per cent
a year ago, American Brands reported overall net income of Dollars 164m, or
81 cents a share, up from Dollars 151m, or 75 cents, a year ago. Half-year
net income fell to Dollars 313m from Dollars 398m (before accounting
changes) in the first six months of 1993.

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Inco, the western world's biggest nickel producer, has suffered deeper
second-quarter losses. It blamed a dip in prices and lower deliveries of
nickel and platinum-group metals.
The loss widened to USDollars 7.6m, or 7 cents a share, from USDollars 2.2m,
or 3 cents, a year earlier. First-half losses grew to USDollars 67.6m, or 60
cents a share, from USDollars 24.8m, or 25 cents, largely reflecting
one-time restructuring charges.
Second-quarter net sales dipped to USDollars 590m from USDollars 604m.
Operating earnings halved to USDollars 22m.
The average nickel price realised in the second quarter was USDollars 2.82
per pound, down from USDollars 2.93 a year earlier, but above the USDollars
2.77 realised in the first three months of 1994.
Inco's performance has been hit this year by lower deliveries of
company-produced nickel and platinum-group metals. The fall was blamed on
production shutdowns and the accumulation of nickel inventory ahead of
summer holiday shutdowns in Canada.
Deliveries of purchased nickel, on which little or no profit is realised,
have, as a consequence, been higher than normal.
These adverse factors were partly offset by higher cobalt and copper prices,
and a slight improvement in operating results from the alloys and engineered
products business.
Finished nickel inventories totalled 75m lbs on June 30, up from 51m lbs on
March 31 and 72m lbs last December.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Capital Cities/ABC, the US entertainment group, yesterday reported a 25 per
cent increase in second-quarter profits and record earnings per share. It
was boosted by another strong performance from its network, cable and
international television businesses.
In the quarter, Capital Cities earned Dollars 189.5m on net revenues of
Dollars 1.54bn, up from Dollars 151.9m on revenues of Dollars 1.44bn a year
earlier.
Earnings per share of Dollars 1.23, up from 92 cents a share, represented a
record for the company. However, it was achieved in the wake of stock
repurchases by Capital Cities which reduced the number of shares outstanding
by almost 11m to 154m.
The strong second quarter took the company's first-half profits to Dollars
305.6m, compared with Dollars 222.4m in 1993 (which excludes a Dollars 12.1m
charge to cover early debt redemption).
The company's flagship ABC television network had another good quarter. It
benefited from increased advertiser demand and improved cost comparisons,
which offset the absence of earnings from the lucrative Academy Awards show,
which this year was broadcast in the first quarter. In the 1993 fiscal year,
it went on air in the second quarter.
The company reported significant growth in its radio business and cable and
international group operations, which include its rapidly-growing ESPN
all-sports cable channel.
Earnings from publishing interests were also higher, attributable to gains
in newspapers and specialised publications.
The second-quarter results pleased investors, who bid the stock up Dollars 1
1/4 to Dollars 79 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange.

<TEXT>
Northern Telecom, the Canadian telecommunications equipment maker, is
cementing a two-year alliance with France's Matra Communications by raising
its stake in the group, from 20 to 50 per cent.
During the next year or so, Northern will invest about USDollars 140m in
Matra, and convert an existing USDollars 150m exchangeable debenture into
equity.
These commitments will raise Northern's total investment to about USDollars
430m. France's Lagardere media and industrial group, formerly
Matra-Hachette, owns the remaining shares in Matra.
The focal point of Northern's interest is Matra's cellular business, which
is based on the European GSM standard. Nortel-Matra Cellular, a joint
venture, recently won a USDollars 100m contract in Taiwan, in what is
believed to be one of the largest deals so far for GSM equipment. Part of
Northern Telecom's capital injection will reinforce the capital of the two
groups in this venture.
The venture has recently won contracts in Tunisia and from Mercury in the
UK, and plans to use the new cash to recruit an extra 150 engineers for its
French-based research centre.
Matra also has a 20 per cent share of the French private branch exchange
(PBX) market, and has given Northern a window to several other parts of the
European telecoms business. 'We're now seeing some fruits of the alliance,'
a Northern official said.

improved demand
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign demand is continuing to fuel growth at Siemens, and there are signs
that domestic orders are also improving, the German electrical and
electronics group said yesterday.
Total order intake in the nine months to the end of June increased 8 per
cent to DM65bn (Dollars 41.6bn). Turnover rose 3 per cent to DM57.7bn, but
net profits fell 6 per cent to DM1.25bn, according to an interim report.
The deterioration in earnings, following an unchanged result after six
months, was foreshadowed recently by Mr Heinrich von Pierer, group chairman,
who said prices in some sectors had fallen 10 per cent or more. Investment
income is also suffering in turbulent capital markets.
The export order book was up 18 per cent at DM39.4bn, while domestic demand
fell 5 per cent to DM25.3bn, after being 6 per cent down at the halfway
mark, the report said.
Siemens-Nixdorf (SNI), the troubled computer subsidiary, also benefited from
a strong order flow in the third quarter. After a 6 per cent fall in the
first six months of the current year, SNI's order book was down only 2 per
cent at the end of the quarter. Sales were 4 per cent lower at DM8bn.
The semiconductors division, recently reported to be in profit for the first
time in a decade, lifted sales and order bookings by 47 per cent and 37 per
cent respectively in the review period.
However, public telecommunications orders were 4 per cent lower, and
turnover was down 9 per cent. Traditionally the group's biggest source of
turnover, the sector is still showing the affects of reduced German public
sector spending.
Power plant, the second-most important division, received a boost in the
third quarter from orders from Taiwan and the UK. At the end of the review
period, orders were 28 per cent higher than a year earlier, although
turnover was 8 per cent lower.
Yesterday's report gave no full-year forecasts, although group executives
recently repeated earlier predictions of a 10-15 per cent drop in operating
earnings for the full year, attributable to a weaker result from financial
operations.
Net income, bolstered by the sale of Siemens' pacemaker operations to a US
concern, is expected to fall slightly short of last year's DM1.98bn.
This year's planned payroll reduction of 20,000 jobs is proceeding according
to plan. After adjustments for the first-time consolidation of the Sylvania
lighting business in the US, numbers employed fell 6,000 in the third
quarter. Some 4,000 of these job cuts were in Germany.

FT  26 JUL 94 / International Company News: Poor results for three big US
energy groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Three big US energy groups produced disappointing second-quarter results
yesterday, reflecting lower profit margins from refined products due to the
rebound in oil prices in recent weeks.
The higher oil price repaired some of the damage done late in 1993 and early
this year to exploration and production profits at Exxon, Mobil and Texaco.
However, this was more than countered by the higher costs faced by
downstream, or refining and marketing, operations, which were unable to
raise prices sufficiently to offset the rebound in the price of the
commodity.
Two of the three, Mobil and Texaco, were also held back by restructuring
costs announced this month.
Exxon, which reported its lowest quarterly after-tax profits since the last
quarter of 1989, saw exploration and production earnings fall by a 11 per
cent, to Dollars 603m.
The company blamed the drop on the fact that oil prices were on average
Dollars 2 a barrel lower than the second quarter of 1993, despite the recent
run-up.
Before one-off charges, Mobil's upstream earnings slipped 15 per cent and
Texaco's fell 37 per cent, to Dollars 335m and Dollars 155m respectively.
Downstream earnings, meanwhile, showed a reverse of the first three months
of the year.
At that time, profit margins had swollen as the companies benefited from
lower input costs. In the second quarter, Exxon's refining and marketing
profits slid 50 per cent, to Dollars 201m; Texaco's fell 41 per cent, to
Dollars 106m; and Mobil's slipped 8 per cent, to Dollars 224m (all figures
before one-off items).
Echoing comments from the other companies, Mr Alfred DeCrane, Texaco
chairman and chief executive, blamed the poor downstream results on rising
costs. 'Market conditions precluded recovery of these added costs to the
refining and marketing units,' he said.
One bright spot for the US oil majors has been the rebound in profitability
at their chemicals businesses in recent quarters. In the latest period,
Exxon said profits had jumped to Dollars 110m, from Dollars 50m a year
before.
Both sales and profit margins in the chemicals business improved during the
latest quarter, and profits have now risen in four consecutive periods, said
Mr Lee Raymond, Exxon's chairman.
Mobil recorded earnings of Dollars 39m from chemicals, almost as much as the
Dollars 44m it made in the whole of last year. Texaco reached agreement
recently to sell its chemicals operations, and accounted for these
operations as a discontinued business.

FT  26 JUL 94 / International Company News: Speedy transformation at
SGS-Thomson - The turnround at the Franco-Italian semiconductor maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When SGS Microelectronics of Italy and Thomson Semiconductor of France
started discussing a merger in 1986, the two companies had a lot in common.
Both of the state-owned enterprises were losing market share, both were in
financial difficulties and both were struggling to survive in an
increasingly competitive industry, with entrenched US and Japanese market
leaders and aggressive pretenders emerging in east Asia.
Eight years on, the transformation has been impressive. The Franco-Italian
group has moved into the black, expanded market share, and has moved to
within striking distance of the world's 10 biggest semiconductor companies.
It is at the head of the field in technologies such as automotive
semiconductors, and Eproms, devices which store data without a power supply,
and is preparing to take on Intel, the industry giant, in the
strategically-important microprocessor market.
The transformation has fed through to the bottom line. Mr Pasquale Pistorio,
the Italian chairman of SGS-Thomson who has guided the company back from the
brink, predicts a strong improvement in profits this year. In the first
quarter, the group chalked up a net profit of Dollars 80m, half of the
result for all of 1992. The second quarter was still better, according to
the chairman.
'It is quite a turnround,' says Mr Pistorio. 'Many people felt that we were
doomed to failure and that Europe could not compete at the top of the world
semiconductor industry.'
Given the problems of achieving a transnational merger and the struggle
faced by many European companies in high technology sectors, the revival
appears all the more striking. It raises two related questions; how has the
turnround been achieved and will the restructuring prove a durable basis for
continued expansion at SGS-Thomson.
The backing of state shareholders, concerned to maintain a presence in a
strategic industry, has certainly helped. Last year, SGS-Thomson received
two capital injections of Dollars 250m each, which have helped bring its
debt-equity ratio to below 30 per cent and ease the burden of financial
charges.
But the recovery has mainly been based on a fundamental reorganisation of
the company's operations and a strong effort in R&amp;D. 'When we started we had
sales of Dollars 44,000 per head,' says Mr Pistorio, well below the industry
average, and about a third of the present level. The result was the closure
of five plants in the first year of the merger, three in France, one in
Malaysia and one in Singapore.
The common factor behind these first actions was speed. 'There were some
within the company who thought we should look at a time scale of two years
to integrate the companies,' says Mr Pistorio. 'But I concluded it was best
to move as quickly as possible. If you go fast then it is difficult for
people to hesitate, and it prevents a long period of confusion for
customers.'
But in spite of the rapid pace of change, two important factors remained
constant - commitment to a global manufacturing and sales presence and the
emphasis on R&amp;D and innovation.
'We have never cut one person in R&amp;D and we have increased research spending
as a proportion of sales to about 18 per cent,' says Mr Pistorio. Efforts
were focused on closing the gap with market leaders in CMOS and VLSI
technologies, used in a series of applications from microcontrollers to the
compression of electronic signals. SGS-Thomson has also maintained its
international operations.
Last year, SGS-Thomson opened a state of the art plant in Crolles in
south-eastern France. Another plant in Phoenix, Arizona, is in the
installation phase, while one in Catania, Sicily, is under construction.
This new capacity will help push up volumes in the company's more advanced
product lines. But, as Mr Pistorio admits, there is still a long way to go.
He says the technology and capital requirements of the sector mean that the
industry will divide into two broad categories; general, broad range,
semiconductor suppliers and small specialist producers. The dividing
criteria, he reckons, will be market share, and the crucial level will be
about 5 per cent, a few points higher than his company's present share.
To lift the company out of what he describes as 'the grey zone', Mr Pistorio
is banking partly on sales growth above the market average and on a further
shift towards higher value-added products. April's decision to enter the
microprocessor market, with devices to be sold under its own name, also
reflect the move towards higher margin products.
In other areas, however, the company's strategy is to develop partnerships.
At the Crolles plant, for example, researchers from Philips work alongside
counterparts from SGS-Thomson on the development of VLSI products. 'It is
the only example of European semiconductor companies putting their leading
edge research together,' says Mr Pistorio.
As for new capital, the chairman finds it hard to disguise his enthusiasm
for privatisation. 'Our shareholders have been very business-minded,' he
says. There is no question, he concludes, that privatisation would make
sense, but the 'if, when and how' is up to the shareholders.
With both the French and Italian governments already embarked on ambitious
privatisation programmes, and with the prospect of further increases in
profits, the privatisation of the company now appears more a question of
when and how, than if.

FT  26 JUL 94 / International Company News: Fund to buy Portuguese groups in
Es24bn deal
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Espirito Santo Development Capital Investors (ESDCIL), a fund dominated by
Mr George Soros, the international financier, is to purchase Portugal's
leading packaging company and two Portuguese and French car battery
producers in deals worth more than Es24bn (Dollars 147m).
The fund has reached an agreement to buy 100 per cent of Colep, a metal and
plastic packaging group with annual sales of Es14bn, for Es20bn-Es25bn.
Colep leads the Portuguese market for aerosol and other cans and is also a
contract filler and distributor of packaged goods.
Colep is majority owned by Mr Ilidio de Pinho, a Portuguese entrepreneur. A
US institutional investor holds about 25 per cent. ESDCIL said Mr de Pinho
was selling to ensure management continuity after his only son died in a car
accident.
About 25 per cent of the cost of the purchase is to be met directly from the
Es16.34bn closed-end fund. Investors in the fund will pay the remainder
separately. Companies controlled by Mr Soros account for 50 per cent of the
ESDCIL fund. The other main investors are Espirito Santo, the Portuguese
financial group, and European, Middle Eastern and US institutions.
In a separate deal, ESDCIL is to acquire 48 per cent of Autosil, a
Portuguese family-owned car battery maker, by injecting about Es4bn in fresh
capital. Autosil will use the funds to purchase 100 per cent of Steco,
France's second automotive battery producer and third in sales, for
FFr100m-FFr120m.
Autosil registered sales of Es3.3bn in 1993, accounting for 30 per cent of
the Portuguese market. Sales are forecast to rise to Es6bn in 1995 as a
result of a contract to supply a new Ford-Volkswagen car plant in Portugal.
Steco's 1993 sales were about FFr500m.
ESDCIL said Autosil and Colep were both likely to be floated on the Lisbon
stock market over the medium term.

FT  26 JUL 94 / International Company News: Strong first-half recovery at
Norsk Hydro
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The strength of the recovery at Norsk Hydro was highlighted yesterday when
the Norwegian energy, fertilisers and metals group unveiled a NKr1.93bn
(Dollars 277m) net profit for the first half-year following a strong second
quarter.
Higher sales volumes, better prices and increased oil and gas production all
contributed to the performance.
In the first half of 1993, net profits amounted to NKr2.63bn but the figure
was inflated by a NKr1.8bn gain from the sale of a 38.3 per cent stake in
Freia Marabou, the Norwegian chocolate maker. The group's shares rose NKr8
to NKr258 before settling back to close NKr1 higher at NKr251.
Hydro, which has just raised NKr4.7bn through a rights issue, said the
result kept it on course for operating profits of NKr10bn in 1996.
First-half operating income rose to NKr3.52bn from NKr2.39bn as revenues
climbed to NKr35.2bn from NKr32.2bn. In the second quarter, operating income
more than doubled to NKr1.93bn from NKr936m as revenues rose to NKr17.9bn
from NKr15.8bn.
All four divisions - oil and gas, light metals, agriculture and
petrochemicals - went ahead in the second quarter.
The biggest improvement came from the agriculture division where rising
fertiliser prices, better productivity and higher volumes helped lift
operating income to NKr544m from NKr99m. Poor weather at the start of the
year pushed demand forward into the second quarter, the group said.
Oil and gas operating income rose to NKr900m from NKr732m as output expanded
to 2.9m tonnes of oil equivalent from 2.2m. Average oil prices at slightly
under Dollars 16 per barrel were Dollars 2 lower than a year ago, but the
impact was partially cushioned by a higher average dollar exchange rate.
Firmer aluminium prices strengthened the light metals division, pushing up
operating income to NKr305m from NKr85m. The petrochemicals division saw
higher sales and better prices, lifting operating profits to NKr172m from
NKr82m.
Mr Alan Marshall, analyst at Swiss Bank Corp in London, said he expected
full-year net income of NKr3.7bn, compared with NKr3bn last year.

Renault, the French state-owned vehicles group and Iveco, the commercial
vehicles subsidiary of Fiat of Italy, yesterday announced that they would
co-operate in the manufacture of cabins for light commercial vehicles.
The agreement reflects the strategy of both companies of seeking
partnerships in specific product lines and technologies to reduce the cost
of vehicle development.
Under the terms of the accord, Renault and Iveco will jointly develop cabs
and cab components, with an expected annual production volume of 120,000
units. Renault will receive part of Iveco's stamped welded output in return
for technology from the French group.
According to a joint statement, the cabs will be fitted on future Iveco
Daily vehicles and on a new Renault light commercial vehicle range. The
different cabs will be assembled in Iveco's Italian plants in Brescia and
Suzzara, and at its Valladolid plant in Spain, while Renault will assemble
the cabs at its Batilly site in France.
The co-operation in cabs follows existing agreements between Renault and
Iveco in vehicle components.

FT  26 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Restructuring helps Bullough recover to
Pounds 7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bullough, the diversified engineering and office products group, yesterday
forecast a return to the 'blue sky' of high margin profits as the benefits
of tight cost controls and restructuring produced a sharp increase in the
interim pre-tax figure.
The group saw first half profits leap from Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 7.13m for
the six months to April 30, even though turnover declined from Pounds 133.4m
to Pounds 132m.
Although the comparable year's figures were undermined by a Pounds 4.67m
restructuring charge, operating profits before provisions rose by 35.5 per
cent from Pounds 5.64m to Pounds 7.64m.
Mr Gordon Bond, who took over as chief executive in January, said: 'Every
division has shown growth and we can now pursue our aim of getting
profitability back to 1990 levels.' In that year pre-tax profits reached
Pounds 28.7m.
His optimism was fuelled mainly by improved results from the heating and
refrigeration divisions, which saw operating profits increase to Pounds
2.55m (Pounds 1.8m) and Pounds 1.66m (Pounds 1.56m).
The engineering and office products sectors both reported lower turnover but
increased their operating profits to Pounds 2.49m (Pounds 2.19m) and Pounds
943,000 (Pounds 83,000) respectively.
The group said it had appointed an internal auditor to oversee financial
controls after a Pounds 1.4m mis-statement last year at the south west
branch of its General Refrigeration subsidiary.
The branch has since been merged with its Midlands operation and the
accountant responsible has been dismissed and faces civil proceedings to
recover more than Pounds 30,000 of missing cash.
The shares rose 9p to 154p yesterday after the group announced earnings per
share of 3.85p (0.02p). The final dividend is held at 1.75p.
COMMENT
Mr Bond has shaken up Bullough. The workforce in the group's office products
companies has been cut in half and managers have been instructed to pursue
quality at low cost. He was lucky to arrive after the group had been through
the worst part of its 'pain first, gain later' restructuring. But he
deserves credit for refocusing it into four key areas and cutting gearing
from 12.5 per cent to 3.1 per cent, leaving plenty of room to buy market
share through acquisitions. Steady long-term growth in each division is a
real prospect and analysts have upgraded their forecasts for full year
pre-tax profits by about 15 per cent to around Pounds 17.5m. On a forward
multiple of 16, the shares seem an expensive but secure long-term bet.

FT  26 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Exceptional costs hit Merrydown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLARE GASCOIGNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock write downs and reorganisation costs pushed Merrydown, the cider and
drinks group, into a pre-tax loss for the year to the end of March, despite
a 33 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 25.6m.
The dividend is cut from 7p to 2.5p, with a proposed final of 1.5p, and the
shares closed 2p lower at 130p yesterday.
Mr Richard Purdey, chairman, said the year had been 'one of the most
difficult in the company's 48-year history', with Christmas sales of cider
'particularly disappointing'.
Exceptional costs of Pounds 2.99m wiped out a small operating profit of
Pounds 894,000 and turned last year's Pounds 1.71m profit into a loss of
Pounds 2.79m.
However, Mr Purdey said the reorganisation would mean savings of Pounds 1.5m
in the current year. 'The group is now wholly focused on drinks,' he said.
The decision had been made to sell Martlet Natural Foods, and an agreement
with Tooheys, the Sydney-based brewing subsidiary of Lion Nathan, will mean
the launch of Merrydown Premium cider in Australia.
Earnings per share before exceptional items and discontinued activities were
2.07p (10.7p), but after exceptionals there were losses per share of 22.76p
(13.03p earnings).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The net asset value per ordinary share of the NatWest Smaller Companies
Investment Trust stood at 114.77p at the June 30 year end, against 100.69p a
year ago. Net asset value of the new C shares was 119.97p at the same date.
The 29.5m C shares were issued in connection with the trust's Pounds 35m
fund-raising exercise in March this year. They will convert into ordinary
shares on July 28 at a ratio of 1.04530801 with one new warrant for every
five shares issued, raising the ordinary shares in issue to 47.2m, against
16.4m.
Some 6.16m new warrants will be issued, which can be exercised at 100p on
October 31 each year until 1998. The record date for conversion is July 22
1994.
Prior to the placing the trust was known as County Smaller Companies
Investment Trust.
Net revenue for the year amounted to Pounds 949,000 (Pounds 556,000).
Earnings emerged at 4.32p (3.4p) per ordinary and 0.82p per C share.
A special interim dividend in respect of the year is declared, comprising a
principal dividend of 1.875p in lieu of a final, thereby maintaining the
total at 3p, and an exceptional dividend of 0.425p which is attributable to
the issue and conversion of the C shares.

FT  26 JUL 94 / UK Company News: BM nets Dollars 22m from US sale
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BM Group, the loss-making engineering company, yesterday announced the
latest in a series of disposals with the sale of a US construction and
mining equipment distributor to Marubeni of Japan for a net consideration of
Dollars 22.2m (Pounds 14.5m).
The sale of Mitchell Distributing, which had been expected before the June
30 year-end, will bring current debt down by Pounds 13.3m to Pounds 52m.
Debt has been reduced substantially from the Pounds 98m reported at the
interim stage by previous disposals. Because of the slight delay in
completing the sale agreement, however, the group will show borrowings of
Pounds 65m when it reports annual figures in October.
BM said the disposal programme, agreed with bankers, was on track. The group
plans to get rid of businesses in Canada - for which it took a Pounds 6m
charge at the interim stage - and operations in Belgium and South Africa.
BM will now have to focus on renegotiating banking facilities to replace the
short-term support which expires in December.

FT  26 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Ryland worth up to Pounds 30m in float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ryland Group, the family-owned vehicle distribution group, yesterday
announced plans for a stock market flotation valuing the company at between
Pounds 25m and Pounds 30m.
The move follows a rapid expansion of the Midlands-based group, which has
spent Pounds 1.5m on new dealerships this year, giving it a network of 25
showrooms across the country.
Mr Peter Whale, chairman and chief executive, hinted that funds raised by
the flotation, by way of a placing sponsored by Albert E Sharp,would be used
to accelerate the group's expansion prog-ramme.
'We expect to raise between Pounds 10m and Pounds 12m and that will give us
greater flexibility in financing acquisitions,' said Mr Whale, a grandson of
Mr Harry Whale, who started the business in 1951 by selling trucks in
Birmingham.
Since then it has established distribution agreements with manufacturers
including BMW, Mercedes, Nissan, Vauxhall, Toyota, Honda, Renault and Ford.
The timing of the flotation has also been influenced by resurgent demand for
new and used cars in the past year.
Buoyant sales helped Ryland increase pre-tax profits from Pounds 773,000 to
Pounds 2m in the year to April 30.
Operating profits moved ahead from Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 3m on increased
turnover of Pounds 190m against Pounds 157m.
Following the placing, the Whale family's holding in the company is expected
to dec-line from 65 per cent to between 30 per cent and 40 per cent.

FT  26 JUL 94 / UK Company News: BA places Pounds 15m Satcom order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Racal, the data communications group, and Honeywell, the US electronic
control systems company, have won a Pounds 15m order from British Airways
for their 'Satcom' satellite communications system.
The contract is the largest Satcom order to date, and establishes
Racal/Honeywell as a strong leader in the rapidly growing market for
airborne digital communications.
British Airways said the new system would 'revolutionise the quality of
communication from the flight deck', with higher quality voice
communications and automatic monitoring for engineering purposes.
Satcom also has the potential to provide a telephone at every seat in the
aeroplane and enhanced passenger entertainment and interactive facilities.
British Airways sees the new system as as an important competitive asset.
Most big airlines have experimented with satellite telephones, but previous
analogue systems have been at best a partial success because of the
variability of sound quality and the cost of the equipment and satellite
time.
British Airways will test the first multi-channel systems this year, and
intends to install them in 90 long-haul aircraft from next year.
These will include Boeing 747s, long-range 767s and McDonnell Douglas DC10s.
The Concorde fleet may also be equipped.
The Racal/Honeywell team has won orders for more than 500 satellite-based
airborne systems from 30 air transport customers, and claims to have
certification on 10 aircraft types.

FT  26 JUL 94 / UK Company News: IMI sells computer offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IMI has sold Redwood International, its lossmaking computing software
subsidiary, to CP Software Group, a California-based software management and
marketing specialist.
IMI will receive Pounds 5m, satisfied by the issue of a secured promissory
note with a maximum maturity of five years.
It will also receive convertible preferred stock and 19.9 per cent of the
common stock of a new US company formed by CP to hold its interest in
Redwood.
IMI is making available up to Pounds 6m of interest bearing loans to support
the repositioning and restructuring of Redwood which CP has planned.
Redwood incurred operating losses of Pounds 4m in 1993, entirely in the
second half, and the loss for the first half of 1994 is expected to rise to
about Pounds 8m.
The directors said the computer software market was becoming more
competitive and the uptake of Redwood's new product range was slower than
expected.
IMI's second half results will reflect an exceptional charge of about Pounds
16m, which will include a write-down in net assets and the loans referred
to.

FT  26 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Marling in black as profits increase abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marling Industries reported yesterday a return to the black thanks to
increased profits from its overseas operations and sharply reduced disposal
costs.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 743,000 in the year to March 31 against losses
of Pounds 9.6m a year earlier. Exceptional costs were Pounds 1.4m compared
with Pounds 8.7m from losses on disposal of discontinued operations.
Pressure on prices pushed turnover on continuing operations down from Pounds
54.7m to Pounds 48.6m. Total turnover was down 25 per cent from Pounds 79m
to Pounds 59m, including Pounds 6.5m from acquisitions and Pounds 3.96m
(Pounds 24.3m) from discontinued operations. Overseas operations contributed
75 per cent of sales.
Marling's strongest performance came from its automotive seat belt webbing
divisions in the Netherlands and Australia. Exports from Webco, its
Australian offshoot, continued to grow, particularly to India, Japan, New
Zealand and China. Mr David Smith, chief executive, said these markets
offered longer term joint venture possibilities.
Mr Smith said high organic growth was anticipated.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MTM, the chemicals group, has agreed to sell its agrochemicals subsidiary to
United Phosphorus, an Indian group, for about Pounds 10.5m in cash.
The disposal will leave MTM with net cash of Pounds 16.2m which it plans to
use for the acquisition of businesses with good profit growth potential.
In the year to last December the agrochemicals business contributed turnover
of Pounds 21.4m and operating profits of Pounds 300,000 to group turnover of
Pounds 53.6m and operating profits of Pounds 1.2m.
The division's net assets had a book value of Pounds 9.3m at the year end.
MTM, whose shares closed up 5p at 71p yesterday, said the division had
insufficient growth potential to justify retaining it as a core business.
The consideration includes a goodwill payment of Pounds 572,580 over net
asset value.

FT  26 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Adam &amp; Harvey profits move ahead by 16%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Adam &amp; Harvey, the international distribution and steel stockholding group,
increased pre-tax profits by 16 per cent from Pounds 4.9m to Pounds 5.7m in
the 12 months to end-March.
Turnover rose from Pounds 40.4m to Pounds 42.1m, and earnings per share
improved from 54.2p to 77.6p.
Mr Gerald Stuart-Lee, chairman, said trading conditions had been 'unusually
varied', but the company had had a 'promising' start to the year.
'The UK subsidiaries and export trading companies will benefit from the
strengthening UK economy and increasing world trade,' he said.
However, although changes in South Africa, Malawi and Kenya, and progress
towards a free market in Zimbabwe, 'should lead to substantial advantages
for the steel division . . . current market instability and pressures on
margins could limit results in the short term'.
In the UK, the hardwood and agricultural machinery companies increased
profits substantially.
Recession held back household goods and medical equipment in Germany.
But agricultural, construction and food processing machinery prospered.

FT  26 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Two more companies use FIDs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROD ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marling Industries and Adam &amp; Harvey announced foreign income dividends
yesterday, doubling the number of companies that have taken advantage of
rules in last year's budgets to relieve surplus advance corporation tax.
The FID scheme was designed to help companies which derive a substantial
portion of their profits abroad. They pay abnormally high taxes when their
UK corporation tax liabilities are insufficient to offset the ACT they have
paid on their conventional dividends.
The first two companies to announce FIDs were BAT Industries, the tobacco
and financial services group which earns about 70 per cent of its profits
abroad, and Courts, the household furniture retailer which has a large
Singapore subsidiary.
A number of other companies are suffering from surplus ACT, particularly
after their UK profits shrank during the recession. However, companies are
proving slower to adopt FIDs than tax advisers had expected.
Several companies such as Burmah Castrol, the lubricants maker, and Keller
Group, a recently floated construction company, have expressed interest in
FIDs but have yet to implement them. The tax changes allowing companies to
pay dividends from foreign income without incurring ACT came into effect on
July 1.
Marling Industries, an industrial textiles maker, said yesterday that its
FID would save Pounds 200,000 in ACT, which it would pass on to its
shareholders via an increased dividend.
A final pay-out of a net 0.57p is recommended, making a total of 0.77p
(0.65p), on a capital base increased 10 per cent by a rights issue last
July. The increased dividend will compensate non-tax paying institutional
shareholders which would have clawed back the ACT on conventional dividends.
Adam &amp; Harvey, an international distributor and steel stockholder, is
recommending a final dividend of 11p gross payable as a FID, making a total
of 18.5p gross for the year. This represents a 23 per cent increase for
non-tax paying shareholders and 42 per cent for UK tax payers.
The board said it would review annually the balance between ordinary and
foreign income dividends, and it is probable the current balance would alter
as unrelieved, carried forward ACT, now standing at about Pounds 400,000, is
absorbed.

FT  26 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Ramsden's helped by new outlets
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jack Charlton, manager of the Irish Republic's national football team,
will be on hand some time before Christmas to officiate at the opening of
Harry Ramsden's in Dublin. He is taking a 10 per cent stake in the 13th
outlet to be opened by the West Yorkshire-based fish and chip restaurant
chain.
New restaurants helped boost the USM-quoted company's pre-tax profits by 16
per cent from Pounds 87,673 to Pounds 101,824 in the six months to April 3
on turnover 12 per cent ahead at Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 1.2m).
Mr John Barnes, chairman, said the company would continue its push into
southern England.
Restaurants in Birmingham and Edinburgh were also opened during the period,
bringing total outlets to 10. Since then Liverpool and Nottingham outlets
have come on stream.
Harry Ramsden's in Hong Kong showed continued growth. Mr Richard Taylor,
finance director, said the experience gained there would be applied to
openings in Singapore by the end of the year.
He anticipated that the first Harry Ramsden's in Melbourne, due to open next
year, would 'not be the last in Australia'. A franchise opening in Jeddah is
due later in 1995.
The interim dividend is unchanged at 1p on earnings of 0.8p (0.7p) per
share.
In May the company made a placing of 213,960 shares at 265p apiece.

FT  26 JUL 94 / UK Company News: The end of an independent life - The Pounds
16m sale of Dale Electric to the TT Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Iain Dale did not try to hide his sadness.
On Friday he and his fellow directors at Dale Electric recommended that
shareholders accept an offer that would end the independent life of the
company his father founded in 1935.
'Of course I am sad, but there is no place for sentiment in these things.'
There will be no place for Mr Dale in TT Group, the acquisitive conglomerate
which is offering Pounds 16m for the North Yorkshire-based generator
manufacturer.
But he believes the best way forward for the company is as part of a larger
group, partly because of increasing competition in international markets.
'The world we face after the recession will be even more competitive than in
the past, and I think we will see other smaller companies facing the
realities of the future and deciding they do not have the critical mass.'
For a company with only 600 employees and sales of Pounds 48m Dale is very
widely spread. Based in Filey it sells into more than 100 countries.
Exports account for more than half its turnover and go to operations as far
afield as Thailand, Mexico and Nigeria.
'We are right in the forefront of world competition and everything we do has
to be the best,' says Mr Dale.
'We have to have the lowest production costs and highest quality and though
we have done very, very well as a group there is a limit to our financial
flexibility. That limits the speed with which we can introduce new products
and develop new markets.'
Dale has been an export-led company almost from the start.
Mr Dale's late father, Leonard, a milkman turned electrician who set up in
business with 11/8d in 1935, started making generators after the war.
When an early advertisement in Farmers' Weekly brought an inquiry from an
ex-pat in Kenya the export business was born.
After steady growth in the 1960s Dale went public in 1972 and was soon
enjoying a boom in exports to the oil-rich Middle East.
Back home, sales of its stand-by generators were boosted by power strikes
and its share price surged as profits topped Pounds 3m in 1978.
But in the early 1980s the combination of the UK recession, the strong pound
and problems in some of its key export markets dealt it a heavy blow from
which it has never fully recovered.
Swiss Bank Corporation's Mr Peter Corley, who brought Dale and TT together,
argues that Dale spread itself too thinly.
'It has a good range of products but has not had the financial muscle to get
the best from them. It did not have the resources to develop markets quickly
enough.'
In view of its patchy record over the last ten years Mr Dale admits: 'Maybe
with hindsight it would have been better to sell out ten years ago.'
There was an opportunity in 1987 when Dale fought off a bid worth 136p a
share from the much smaller Sunleigh. The shares reached a high of 147p in
1989 compared with yesterday's close of 72p.
Longer term shareholders have done even worse. Allowing for a one-for-one
scrip issue in 1977 the shares were floated at 56p which after 22 years of
inflation would be worth more than Pounds 4.
But Dale is held in great affection by many in the financial community. Mr
Rodney Lambert, a long-time follower at Roy James, the Birmingham
stockbrokers, agrees that it might have been better if it had sold before.
But, like many, he finds it hard to criticise. 'The TT deal is a good one
given current conditions but I am sorry to see it go.'

FT  26 JUL 94 / UK Company News: New contracts help Capita rise 33%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Capita Group, which provides services to the public sector, increased
pre-tax profits by 33 per cent to Pounds 2.71m in the six months to June 30
and said prospects were encouraging.
Group turnover rose by 38 per cent to Pounds 30.5m, thanks mainly to new
contracts in the outsourcing division, which provides revenue-collection and
computer services to local government.
Outsourcing revenues increased by 77 per cent to Pounds 21.1m and operating
profits almost doubled Pounds 1.51m. Capita said the division's five-year
projected revenue stood at Pounds 118m at the half-year, up from Pounds 109m
last time.
Mr Rod Aldridge, chairman, said the group had taken a strategic decision to
strengthen its sales activities in the central government and utilities
markets to complement its core local authority work.
He said: 'This should provide a balance of revenue. Inevitably, there is a
temporary reduction in activity in the local government market as local
authorities implement the local government review.'
Operating profits from the advisory division rose by 43 per cent to Pounds
600,000, even though sales fell 5 per cent to Pounds 4.4m. Capita said the
drop in turnover was mainly because of increasing competition in the
provision of short-term managers to the public sector.
Profits from the property services division fell by 14 per cent to Pounds
600,000, although sales were 8 per cent higher at Pounds 5m.
Capita said that to provide additional support to its revenue management
operations it paid Pounds 1.05m in April for John Crilley &amp; Son, one of the
country's leading collection or bailiff agencies.
Since the half-year, the group had acquired Sims Holdings, a supplier of
computer systems and support services to the education market, for an
initial Pounds 6m. Mr Paul Pindar, managing director, said Sims provided
Capita with an important position in the growing education sector, a market
which accounted for 9 per cent of gross public expenditure.
Earnings per share increased 33 per cent to 3.8p (2.86p). The interim
dividend rose by 29 per cent to 1.1p (0.85p), and the group said it expected
to pay a total dividend for the year of 3.3p, a 29 per cent increase.

<TEXT>
Scantronic Holdings, the security components manufacturer and distributor
which last month delayed publication of its full-year results, yesterday
said Mr Ray Dias, its finance director, was resigning and it would be unable
to pay a final dividend.
The company said Mr Dias had failed to alert the board to the twin impact of
increased borrowing and difficult trading conditions. Net indebtedness rose
from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 7.6m in the year to March 31, and stood at Pounds
11.2m by the end of last month.
Borrowing increased following two acquisitions: Alarmexpress, the UK
security equipment distributor, and Arius, the US distributor.
The group said it expected to report pre-tax profits in the next two weeks
of not less than Pounds 2.75m for the year to March 31, against Pounds 1.6m.
The announcement was made after the market closed and the shares were
unchanged at 48p.

FT  26 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Caledonia Invs raises Ivory &amp; Sime stake
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Caledonia Investments, the holding company controlled by the Cayzer family,
has increased its stake in Ivory &amp; Sime, the Scottish fund management group,
from 15 per cent to 24.9 per cent.
Caledonia bought 2.9m shares in Ivory &amp; Sime on Friday at about the market
price of 224p.
Most of the shares, which were bought in the market, came from Abtrust, the
fund manager that acquired part of Ensign Trust's 16.7 per cent holding last
year.
Earlier last week Caledonia increased its stake by 13 per cent after sales
by Abtrust and Scottish Value Trust.
Sir David Kinloch, deputy chief executive of Caledonia, would not been drawn
on whether the company intended to increase its holding to 29.9 per cent.
'Obviously we have taken the holding as a long-term investment as we
normally do. We hope that by stabilising their shareholder structure we will
help them develop.'
Caledonia has a long and lucrative record of taking large minority stakes in
financial companies.
Caledonia owns investment trust manager Clan Asset Management with funds of
about Pounds 240m.

Sherwood Computer Services, has sold Sherwood Consort Data, its subsidiary
providing software and services to the stockbroking market, to its
management for a maximum of Pounds 450,000.
The directors said the disposal is in line with declared strategy of
concentrating on core activities and, in particular, to reduce conflict with
City Deal Services, the company's own execution-only stockbroking arm.
In 1993 Consort had a turnover of Pounds 835,000 and a net loss of Pounds
1,000. It had a net deficit on reserves of Pounds 33,000.
Sherwood Computer received Pounds 250,000 on completion and will receive a
further consideration up to a maximum Pounds 200,000 payable as a royalty on
licence sales. Proceeds will reduce the company's overdraft.

Lex Service, Britain's largest car distribution and leasing group, is
expected to report a sharp increase in interim pre-tax profits this week.
The rise follows exceptional gains on the sale of the last tranche of shares
in Arrow Electronics, which it received in part payment for the disposal of
its North American electronic components distribution businesses to Arrow in
September 1991.
Analysts predict profits will climb to Pounds 31m (Pounds 21.2m) under FRS 3
when the group announces its results tomorrow. Yesterday's Financial Times
incorrectly reported that the results were due today.

<TEXT>
Euromoney Publications, the publisher and training and conference organiser,
yesterday announced it was to acquire a 67 per cent stake in Raven Fox, a
fellow publishing company which specialises in the business to business
international travel retail market.
Euromoney will make an initial payment of Pounds 3.8m followed by a deferred
payment of up to Pounds 1.5m, dependent upon Raven's profits in the year to
end-December 1994.
Euromoney will acquire the balance of the equity in 1996, for which a
further performance-related payment is payable dependent upon Raven's
profits in the 1995 year.
The total consideration will not exceed Pounds 8.14m, although the directors
of Euromoney estimate that it will probably fall in the region of Pounds 7m.
In the year to December 31 1993 Raven Fox made a pre-tax profit of Pounds
654,000. Net assets at that date amounted to Pounds 884,000.
Euromoney, whose ultimate holding company is Rothermere Investments, in May
this year raised some Pounds 20m via a placing to fund its aggressive
acquisition policy.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
London International Group, the condom maker, saw its Pounds 115m rescue
rights issue taken up by 88.3 per cent of its shareholders.
The good result was helped by a strong last minute surge in the share price
which has risen by 11p to 85p over the past week compared with the rights
price of 70p.
Mr James Tyrrell, finance director, said: 'We are very pleased with the
result and now have to get on and run the company efficiently and realise
shareholder value.'
Market sources said the share price had been buoyed by significant buying
interest, particularly from the US, and from improved sentiment in the stock
market as a whole.
The rump of the rights issues shares were placed at 85p, yielding a premium
of 13.8p after expenses.

FT  26 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Greggs advances 27% to Pounds 3.66m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greggs, the manufacturer and retailer of bread, confectionery and savoury
products, yesterday reported pre-tax profits up 27 per cent from Pounds
2.89m to Pounds 3.66m for the 24 weeks to June 18.
A 7.5 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 51.9m, against Pounds 48.3m,
included an increase of 1.5 per cent in core volume.
Earnings per share were up by 26 per cent from 17p to 21.4p and the interim
dividend is increased by 17 per cent to 7p per share, compared with 6p.
The interim results cover the period immediately before Greggs' acquisition
of the Baker's Oven business from Associated British Foods on June 19. This
boosted total outlets from 505 to 929, making Greggs Britain's largest
retail baker, trading from Pitlochry to Southampton.
Mr Mike Darrington, managing director, said the priorities now were
implanting Greggs' decentralised structure into Baker's Oven, improving the
acquisition's quality and efficiency and addressing its continuing core
volume decline.
He said several years' hard work lay ahead to realise the full benefits but
it would cover its financing costs from the outset. Some benefits were
already being felt, including better buying for the enlarged business.
At the period end Greggs had net cash of Pounds 12.6m. Year-end borrowings
are expected to be less than Pounds 5m despite the Pounds 12m net
acquisition cost of Baker's Oven, and a record Pounds 16m capital
expenditure programme.
Mr Darrington said he expected a satisfactory result for the whole year, but
predicted slower profit growth in the second half, partly due to the
start-up costs of new bakeries in London and Birmingham. Recent hot weather
was also a factor, denting sales of pastries, cream cakes and sweet cake
lines.

FT  26 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 227,000 loss for Clinical Computing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The costs of moving to new premises in the UK, setting up an office in the
US and investing in product development, together with delays in customers
placing orders, pushed Clinical Computing, the medical software company,
into a Pounds 227,000 loss for the six months to June 30.
The share price fell 10p to 90p on the news, against a flotation price of
124p and a high of 173p on the first day of trading when the company came to
market in a Pounds 3.1m flotation in February.
Turnover was down from Pounds 1.18m to Pounds 735,000 and the first-half
loss compares with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 446,000 for the same period
last year. Losses per share came out at 1.4p against earnings of 3.7p.

FT  26 JUL 94 / American Barrick joins fight for Lac with CDollars 2.1bn bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
American Barrick, the gold producer controlled by Canadian entrepreneur Mr
Peter Munk, yesterday joined the battle for Lac Minerals with a CDollars
2.1bn (USDollars 1.52bn) bid for the Toronto-based mining group.
Barrick's offer is likely to find more favour with Lac directors and
shareholders than the hostile bid earlier this month by Royal Oak Mines of
Vancouver.
Mr James Pitblado, Lac's new chairman, said it was 'always gratifying to be
wooed' but added that the offer was 'still inadequate and doesn't reflect
the values in this company'.
Barrick has offered Lac shareholders CDollars 4 in cash and 0.31 Barrick
shares per Lac share, or an all-paper deal of 0.43 Barrick shares per Lac
share.
The offer is valued at about CDollars 14 a share, fractionally higher than
the Royal Oak bid. However, investors are likely to prefer Barrick paper to
Royal Oak, which is a much smaller company with higher-cost mines.
Mr Munk said the acquisition could give Barrick a chance to repeat the rapid
growth it has enjoyed in recent years from the development of the Goldstrike
mine in Nevada.
Its 'experience, capacity and financial wherewithal' could be used to bring
substantial reserves at Lac's two Chilean properties rapidly to production.
It would probably sell some of Lac's six largest properties in Canada.
Lac last week raised its estimates of reserves in the El Indio belt in
northern Chile from 3.5m to 7.3m ounces, plus 11.8m ounces in 'geological
resources'. Mr Munk said Barrick would be able to develop these, largely
from internal resources. There is also potential for 'significant' savings
in overheads when the two companies are combined.
Existing and potential earnings would more than offset charges, estimated at

FT  26 JUL 94 / AirTouch and US West merge cellular businesses in the US

AirTouch Communications, the California-based cellular telephone company,
and US West, the Baby Bell regional telecommunications group, are to merge
their domestic cellular telephone businesses in a joint venture.
The venture will create the third largest provider of cellular phone
services in the US. It will have cellular licences in 16 of the top 30
markets and serve more than 1.7m customers.
The deal, which requires the approval of federal regulators, is the latest
in a line of alliances within the fast-growing mobile communications
business. Analysts see this as part of a restructuring of the US telecoms
industry in the face of regulatory upheaval, technological change and the
erosion of boundaries between local, long-distance and mobile services.
AirTouch is the former cellular arm of Pacific Telesis, while US West is a
Denver-based operator covering 14 mid-western states. While neither
companies' international operations will be included in the joint venture,
the two groups will work together to develop non-US business.
In Europe, AirTouch has a stake in Mannesmann Mobilfunk, the second cellular
network in Germany, and in the consortium behind Italy's second network. US
West's overseas interests include a half-share in Mercury One-2-One, the
third-largest UK cellular operator.
Under the terms of the deal, AirTouch will own 70 per cent of the joint
venture and US West 30 per cent, with US West allowed to convert its stake
into direct ownership of AirTouch stock subject to certain conditions. For
regulatory reasons the two operations will initially be kept separate, with
a single entity providing management and support services.
The announcement of the joint venture came on the day the US government
began auctioning licences for 'narrowband' personal communications services
(PCS) such as paging and voice messaging. AirTouch and US West said
yesterday they were also creating a joint venture to pursue PCS
opportunities.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Lucas dismisses investigation claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lucas Industries, the UK-based engineering group, yesterday dismissed claims
that it was under criminal investigation in the US for falsifying inspection
of parts for commercial aircraft.
A report in yesterday's Wall Street Journal caused Lucas's shares to fall
from 198p to 183p when trading started in London, but they recovered to
close at 193p following the denial.
The Journal said US industry and law enforcement officials had told it Lucas
was being investigated over serious quality control lapses involving devices
that help move the flaps on Boeing's 767 twin-engine jets.
Lucas said yesterday that through its own investigations, it had discovered
that a small number of in-process visual inspections had not been conducted
on the trailing-edge flap actuators supplied to Boeing.
It added: 'However, final inspection and functional tests on computerised
test-rigs, which determined the integrity of the products, were fully and
successfully completed. After this discovery, Lucas voluntarily informed
Boeing and, in accordance with Lucas compliance practice, the US
government.'
The UK group said it had taken disciplinary action against three employees,
dismissing two of them. It added: 'Lucas performed analysis to confirm
flight safety of the actuators. These indicated that the parts met all
quality requirements and Boeing concurs. There were and are no quality
problems on these products.'
Boeing said: 'This appears to us as a process problem, and not a quality
problem, that Lucas caught and fixed. We concur with Lucas that these parts
meet all quality requirements and believe the product is absolutely safe.'
Lucas said it had notified the US Justice Department of the problems at its
Lucas Western plant at Park City, Utah, but was not aware of any active
investigation by the department .
In May Lucas confirmed that it was under investigation by the Pentagon for
allegedly supplying gearboxes from the Utah Plant that fell below specified
standards for the US Navy's F/A-18 fighter aircraft.
It also recently agreed to pay Dollars 12m (Pounds 8m) in the US to settle a
dispute over the supply of unsatisfactory components for the Maverick
air-to-ground missile.
Lucas said yesterday it had made significant progress with its corrective
action plan at the Utah factory, since discovery of the problem with the US
Navy gearbox contract last year.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Fingers crossed as Digital gets to grips: The US computer
maker's struggle to halt a string of losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They used to call it the 'Digital handshake': arms folded, index fingers
extended in either direction, indicating that responsibility lay anywhere
other than with the individual concerned.
Today fingers are pointing at the senior management of Digital Equipment,
the struggling US computer manufacturer, as it prepares to announce its
fourth consecutive set of annual losses, including roughly Dollars 1.6bn
(Pounds 1.04bn) of charges to cover 20,000 job losses, cutting 10m sq ft of
manufacturing and office space, and asset write-offs.
The Massachusetts company is also preparing to abandon matrix management in
favour of a simpler system conferring greater accountability for decisions.
How serious are Digital's problems? Mr Enrico Pesatori, head of the newly
constituted computer systems division, underlines the urgency: 'The company
must return to profitability in the next two quarters. We are not running
out of money - we have a strong balance sheet - but if we fail, the
confidence of our employees, our shareholders and our customers will sink to
a point that will be very serious for us.' The fear is that continuing
losses and a failure of confidence will eventually pitch the company into a
financial death spiral.
Crucial to the resuscitation of the group is the performance of Mr
Pesatori's division, essentially the heart of Digital's traditional
business. Medium and large computer systems are losing money because the
cost of supporting large engineering, manufacturing and sales operations
remains out of line with anticipated rev-enues.
Mr Pesatori, 53, joined Digital last year from Groupe Bull of France, to
revitalise the PC operations. Following the surprise resignation in April
this year of Mr Edward Lucente, head of worldwide sales and marketing, Mr
Pesatori was promoted to his present position, essentially number two to
chief executive Mr Robert Palmer and carrying most of the responsibility for
Digital's recovery strategy.
Digital's traditional computer business, a source of strength in the 1980s,
is now its biggest headache. Since May, Mr Pesatori and other senior
executives have put together a five-point plan to enable the division to
break even by the end of this financial year. If it works, he argues, the
company will be comfortably in profit through its other activities. His
analysis reads like a catalogue of the mistakes Digital has made over the
past years:
First, he says, the division has to focus on important markets: 'We have
been all over the place in engineering and in the industries we served. We
have not focused on our strengths.'
Second, there has to be an new emphasis on low-cost, high volume products,
the bread and butter of the new computer industry. 'Our engineering
capabilities have become isolated from the market. We excelled in niche
markets, but niche players employ 5,000 people, not 90,000.'
Third, Digital has to restore a credible distribution policy based on a
reliable network of dealers, systems integrators and value added resellers
(VARs).
The company had an excellent network in the 1980s, but threw it away because
of fears about loss of account control and smaller shares of the gross
profits. Now the plan is that only the largest 1,000 customers worldwide
will be serviced directly. The remaining 7,000 will be handled by VARs and
dealers. In the UK, for example, only 100 of the company's 800 customers are
still serviced directly.
Fourth, accountability. The new management structure should ensure that
executives are responsible for their decisions. Mr Pesatori notes: 'We have
to open up a complex, layered structure. We have to penetrate robust layers
of management that are resistant to change.'
Fifth, profitability. Mr Pesatori believes there is no magic in the business
model for the modern computer industry: 'You have to have a 40 per cent
gross profit margin; general administrative expenses should not be above 22
per cent and research and development should not cost more than 12 per cent
of revenues.' It is generally acknowledged that its overheads and
engineering costs are twice as high as some rivals'.
The dilemma for Digital is the decline of revenues from its traditional,
proprietary systems while customers ponder moving to newer, lower cost
industry standard systems.
The company was slow to embrace standard systems, then shot itself in the
foot with a panicky campaign to persuade customers to move quickly to the
newer technology. Mr Pesatori hopes to stabilise the migration, creating a
more predictable and manageable loss of revenues from Digital's proprietary
hardware.
Nobody discounts the difficulty of the task Digital's management is
attempting: 'Between here and there is a tremendous implementation problem,'
admits Mr Pesatori, 'but we have contingency plans and our strategy is based
on very pessimistic estimates of our revenues.'
Digital has been its own worst enemy since its troubles became apparent four
years ago; this latest offensive may be its last chance to avoid a spiral of
decline.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Trafalgar takes further charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trafalgar House yesterday announced further restructuring costs for its
troubled engineering division, only seven months after it revealed Pounds
397.3m of exceptional charges - described by analysts as a 'kitchen sink
exercise'.
The engineering, shipping and property group said the latest charges,
amounting to 'not less than Pounds 15m', were being made to ensure that the
engineering division could operate profitably at reduced levels of business.
Trafalgar shares fell 4p to 78p yesterday, their low point for the year, as
analysts marked down earnings forecasts by close to one third. Forecasts
were also cut after disappointing interim results on May 26.
Brokers are now suggesting pre-tax profits of around Pounds 35m for the year
to September, compared with a consensus forecast of Pounds 80m at the start
of the year.
Most of the restructuring costs will cover job losses among the engineering
division's 22,000 workers. A Trafalgar official indicated that the latest
redundancies were likely to be in the 'hundreds'.
In addition, the company is planning to merge some of its European
operations. Trafalgar announced at the time of its interim results that the
engineering division remained weak due to problems in Europe and a downturn
in North Sea oper-ations.
The figures revealed that operating profit margins from engineering had
fallen from 2.8 per cent to 1.2 per cent, and Mr Simon Keswick, chairman,
said at the time that 'further downsizing' would be necessary.
In the latest letter to shareholders Mr Keswick said that conditions had 'if
anything, become more difficult since then'.
Mr Andrew Mitchell, analyst at Smith New Court, said: 'Longer-term, the cost
base will be improved, but this underlines the fact that it is going to be a
long haul for Trafalgar to achieve a full recovery.'
The company also gave details yesterday of the latest acquisition by its
cruise line subsidiary Cunard. Cunard is paying Dollars 170m (Pounds 113m)
for the Royal Viking Sun, but this figure could increase if profits exceed
Dollars 35m year in either or both of the two years commencing July 1. The
maximum amount payable is Dollars 5m.
