FT  26 JUL 94 / Beef trade fears for sales to EU: Agriculture ministry
acknowledges new rules will hit exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bulk of Britain's beef exports to the European Union will come to a halt
this week when new restrictions to stop the spread of 'mad cow disease' take
effect, meat traders warned yesterday.
'We've been sold down the river by the government,' said one beef exporter
who did not want to be named. 'They've agreed to a system which means we'll
virtually stop exporting British beef to the EU.'
The rules agreed by EU farm ministers last week were hailed as a victory by
Mrs Gillian Shephard, then UK agriculture minister, because they led Germany
to drop its threat of a unilateral import ban on British beef.
The rules say Britain may not export beef carcases containing bone unless
the animal is certified as coming from a herd that has been free of the
disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, for six years, instead of two
years as at present.
Agriculture ministry officials are advising meat exporters to develop a
market for de-boned beef instead. 'Although we recognise there will be
effects on trade, there's no point in talking ourselves into a crisis,' the
ministry said.
According to figures from the Meat and Livestock Commission, an estimated
107,000 tonnes of 'bone-in', or carcase, beef were exported to the EU last
year, some 84 per cent of total UK beef exports to the EU.
The purpose of de-boning is to remove nervous and lymphatic tissues which
might carry the disease. The new rules are designed to prevent diseased
tissue finding its way into animal feed in continental markets.
A large beef exporter, who also did not want to be identified, said he would
be forced to lay off about 150 people. He feared a knock-on effect on the
British beef market.
'If this is winning the battle, I'm glad we didn't lose,' he said.
He believed BSE was so widespread that no more than 18 per cent of animals
could be certified safe for export, assuming their health history could be
traced. The Ministry of Agriculture says there have been 131,757 cases of
BSE and more than half the country's dairy herds have had at least one case.
The bulk of carcase beef exports are dairy cows that have passed their
useful productive life and have been slaughtered, mainly for processing into
meat pies and sausages.
Tracking the health history of these older animals, which may have lived on
four or five different farms, will be extremely difficult, traders and
farmers' leaders say.
'Three, four or five years ago that animal may have come from another farm
and the seller won't know if there was BSE there or if that farm had BSE
subsequently,' said Mr Ian Gardiner, policy director of the National
Farmers' Union.
However, he said the new rules made sense given the delay in the appearance
of the disease in an animal. 'The two-year rule had very little
justification with a disease that takes four to five years to show.'
Meat companies say there is no spare capacity for de-boning. Moreover, they
question whether France, the most important market, will agree to pay more
for a service it prefers to do itself.
If the continental market dried up, carcase beef could seek an outlet in the
UK. That could seriously damage the home market, the MLC said.

FT  26 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Euro Disney
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are two possible explanations for the 4 per cent fall in Euro Disney's
shares in heavy volume yesterday. One is renewed short selling at the start
of the new account on the Paris bourse. The other is that small investors
took advantage of the first day's trading in the newly issued shares to sell
them down to the rights issue price. What seems unlikely is that the
underwriting banks have begun to anticipate a small take-up of the rights
issue and are positioning themselves accordingly. Not only is the Saudi
Prince al-Waleed standing by to relieve them of up to two-thirds of their
exposure. The banks still claim no more than a faint inkling of how the
issue has gone.
That said, it is regrettable that the French system requires a full month
for subscriptions to be added up. A large uncertainty hangs over the shares
meanwhile, and there are plenty of grounds for scepticism. On its own
forecasts Euro Disney does not expect to make a profit before 1996; it will
still be 250 per cent geared even after the rights issue.
Above all, the Saudi prince's intervention holds out no promises to outside
shareholders. So far his presence has been more of a comfort to Walt Disney
and the underwriters of the rights issue.
Perhaps his conference centre will fill up Euro Disney's under-used hotels,
but financing the second phase of the theme park would remain tricky. Just
because the prince made a handsome profit out of his investment in Citicorp
does not mean the same must be true of Euro Disney too.

FT  26 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Radio
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors in the UK television sector know how incoherent regulatory regimes
can produce stock market mayhem. The radio sector may be about to experience
a similar speculative frenzy. A judicial review of the Radio Authority's
approval of EMAP's bid for Trans World Communications starts tomorrow. If
the authority's decision is upheld, it could lead to a further rash of
corporate activity. If not, it calls into question whether radio's regulator
is deemed capable of minding its own back yard.
The review concerns EMAP's attempt to skirt ownership rules by proposing to
sell two licences to a separate venture jointly owned with its merchant
bank. This arrangement makes a mockery of the spirit, if not the letter, of
the Broadcasting Act, although the Radio Authority seems powerless to
object. Other companies have devised similarly ingenious means of splitting
ownership and control. Daily Mail and General Trust has increased its stake
in Chiltern Radio above the permitted 20 per cent by buying more shares
through a joint venture company.
Radio is already one of the hottest stock market sectors because of its high
operational gearing and potential to grab a bigger slice of the advertising
cake. For example, Capital Radio now trades on 36 times historic earnings.
But with big media groups, such as Reuters, keen to muscle in on radio, the
excitement may rise further. That makes it all the more imperative for the
government to speed up its review of media ownership rules and finally
introduce a coherent set of industry-wide regulations.

FT  26 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Norsk Hydro
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Norsk Hydro's collection of commodity-based businesses was always likely to
enjoy the first half of the year. With interests ranging from aluminium to
ammonia to PVC and crude oil, the group looks tailor-made to benefit from
the early stages of a turn in the commodities cycle. Having asked
shareholders for Nkr4.7bn equity earlier in the summer, management may also
have felt obliged to squeeze every last krona out of the business.
Even so, yesterday's second-quarter figures exceeded even the stock market's
high expectations. While commodity price rises are public knowledge, the
extent of operational gearing came as something of a surprise. This was
especially true in fertilisers, the subject of a massive restructuring
charge two years ago. Firmer fertiliser prices, decent demand outside Europe
and lower exports from eastern Europe all helped improve the position over
last year. But cost-cutting was the foundation of the five-fold rise in
divisional operating profits in the second quarter.
European companies with less well-appointed spreads of business - or which
have been less vigorous in pursuit of efficiency - can not be expected to
deliver such a spectacular rebound. Neither can Norsk Hydro count on further
sharp rises in all its main commodities at once. But companies which have
been shaving costs through recession and are now achieving modest price
increases may also surprise with the speed of recovery.

FT  26 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Life gets tougher
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The summer season of new business figures has shown just why the life
insurance sector has underperformed the stock market by 20 per cent in the
last year. The 30 per cent fall in sales of life and pensions policies
reported yesterday by Refuge - which prompted a 5 per cent fall in the
shares - was especially poor. In addition to public distrust of the industry
as a whole, the company had to retrain its sales force to keep the regulator
happy. But bending over backwards to please the regulator is becoming a way
of life. With full disclosure of sales commissions around the corner,
pleasing customers is not going to get easier.
Increased sales of unit trusts are scant consolation. Margins earned by
companies on this type of investment business are unlikely to match
with-profits or pensions policies. The flow of unit trust business could
also dry up, or even reverse, if the stock market enters a bear phase. In
the long run, life companies could become more geared to the investment
cycle and less solidly defensive than hitherto.
Changes in business mix and lower overall sales will take time to filter to
the bottom line. Profits and dividend growth will be supported for some time
by maturing life policies sold in the 1980s or before. On a yield premium of
30 per cent to the stock market average, and with dividend growth
effectively underwritten, the sector will find support. But it cannot live
off its fat forever. A sustained rally in the shares looks unlikely indeed
until the new business prospects are clear.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Search begins for cause of blaze at Texaco refinery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investigators will today move into the stricken Texaco refinery at the Welsh
port of Milford Haven to ascertain the cause and extent of the 36-hour blaze
which forced the plant to close.
The main fire was extinguished last night, and two smaller fires were being
allowed to burn themselves out. But investigators had to wait for
temperatures to cool before they could approach.
There were no serious injuries from the fire, though the explosion which
caused it on Sunday damaged nearby buildings and caused some minor injuries
to Texaco staff.
The fire was centred on the catalytic cracker, a key part of the process for
making petrol at the refinery. Texaco said last night it hoped to have a
preliminary indication of the extent of the damage done to the plant by late
this afternoon. The fire is thought to have been caused by a lightning
strike.
The US oil company said the damage would have no immediate effect on its
ability to supply its network of service stations in the UK or its
contracted commercial customers. It also said that it would be able to
maintain product quality.
News of the blaze caused a small rise in the price of petrol in the
wholesale market yesterday morning. According to Platts, the information
service which monitors trade in petroleum products, petrol rose about
Dollars 5 a tonne to Dollars 190.
But generally, petrol companies doubted that the closure of the refinery,
which accounts for about 10 per cent of UK refining capacity, would have
significant repercussions, even though the blaze has struck at the height of
the summer motoring season.
There is a 5-10 per cent capacity surplus in the UK, and all the leading
petrol companies have product exchange arrangements to deal with shortages.
The UK is also a large petrol exporter, and supplies could be diverted back
on to the domestic market if need be. Alternatively, imports could be
brought in from the Continent where stocks are plentiful.
'We don't expect there to be any significant effects on supplies,' said a
spokesman for Shell, the UK's largest petrol retailer.
Texaco is a large supplier to supermarkets who have recently begun to attack
the petrol market. However, Tesco said last night that Texaco was only one
of many suppliers. 'We don't anticipate any problems in supply, and we still
aim to be the cheapest in any given area,' a spokeswoman said.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Bretton Woods (50 Years): If you go down to the woods today
 -Martin Wolf offers the Group of Seven leaders a recipe for reforming the
world's economic institutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The separate economic blocs and all the friction and loss of friendship
they must bring with them are expedients to which one may be driven in a
hostile world, where trade has ceased over wide areas to be co-operative and
peaceful and where are forgotten the healthy rules of mutual advantage and
equal treatment. But it is surely crazy to prefer that.'
With these words, uttered shortly before his death, Lord Keynes commended
the Bretton Woods agreement to the House of Lords. It was a noble legacy of
the Anglo-American co-operation during the second world war.
A month after the landings in Normandy, a new world economic regime had been
designed at the celebrated conference in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire. That
the victory was not wasted was largely due to the rebirth, at least in the
industrial countries, of the ideas Keynes extolled. It has not been the
details of the Bretton Woods agreement that matter. Many have had to be
abandoned. What has mattered most is the commitment to a co-operatively
managed and increasingly liberal, global economy. That is the legacy to
cherish.
Anniversaries are valuable if used for taking stock of what is left from the
past and for devoting thought to the needs of tomorrow. Largely by chance,
now is an appropriate time in which to ask what the needs of tomorrow might
be.
The collapse of the only serious rival to the liberal model is five years
old, long enough not only to become used to that event, but to appreciate
the scale of the debris communism leaves behind. Yet the greatest economic
challenge for the western world is the need to adjust to the rise of east
Asia. A world economy in which only about a sixth of the population enjoy
prosperity will be transformed by the arrival of perhaps another 3bn. Nor
will the challenge be merely economic. This will be more than a mere shift
in power among similar countries: five centuries of dominance by Europe and
its American progeny are coming to an end.
Fortunately, at President Clinton's prompting, western leaders have shown a
belated awareness of the issue in calling, at the recent summit of the Group
of Seven industrial countries in Naples, for a review of institutional
requirements in the global economy. So what might a comprehensive report to
the G7 leaders cover?
The starting point is the success of the postwar economic system, a success
measured by almost five decades of trade-led growth (see chart). Even though
increased real incomes have been enjoyed in most parts of the world, they
have not been enjoyed everywhere. One fifth of the world population produces
 -and enjoys - 85 per cent of the world's income. The degree of global
inequality has also been increasing. Worst of all, even though most
indicators - such as infant mortality, life expectancy and school enrolment
 -show improvements since the 1950s almost everywhere, more than a billion
people, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, subsist on less than a
dollar a day.
Economies have done well and their residents prospered to the extent that
they have been able, or willing, to exploit the opportunities offered by an
increasingly global market economy. North America, Europe and Japan have
been able to do this. So too have many developing countries. The paper,
Learning from the Past, Embracing the Future, released by the World Bank
last week, shows that income per head in east Asia had risen by some 350 per
cent since 1960, while that of Latin America is significantly lower than it
was in 1975. Worst of all, sub-Saharan Africa's income per head is back
where it was in 1960.
Such failures are, above all, those of nation states. One part of the
problem has been the determination of many developing countries to turn away
from the global market, by seeking the bankrupt path of 'self-reliance'.
This mistake can be rectified. But the difficulty is deeper than that. Many
states are unable or unwilling to provide such basic economic services such
as reasonably impartial property rights enforcement, efficient or honest
administration, basic education and health, or minimal infrastructure. Not
infrequently, governments have been murderous and exploitative. Worst of
all, states have occasionally dissolved altogether.
This is an extreme illustration of a fundamental issue: the relation between
the market, which is increasingly global, and states, which are local, often
blinkered and sometimes demonic. Four points need to be remembered
throughout any G7 discussions.
First, the most important purpose of international economic regimes is to
render national policies globally compatible. Sometimes this is done through
day-to-day co-operation. It is done more effectively, however, by embodying
international agreements within domestic laws and policies. That is what the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has achieved, if partially.
Second, at least half of the spending of modern states is concerned with
income redistribution, with internal income transfers as much as 50 times
larger than international ones. In consequence, citizens of states that are
both impoverished and incompetent (or worse) are excluded from the benefits
and opportunities afforded by the global economy, except through migration.
Third, because the politics of wealthy countries focus on internal income
distribution, developments that undermine customary patterns are immediately
subject to attack by protectionist antibodies. One of the great challenges
for the industrial countries in future will be to sustain economic openness
under such pressures.
Finally, the customary complaint that the internationalisation of the world
economy jeopardises sovereignty is correct, but only in the sense that it
curbs redistributive politics by limiting a government's ability to tax
mobile factors of production. It is wrong in the mistaken proposition that
countries cannot affect their economic fates. Whether or not a government
encourages its people to exploit global opportunities has, in fact, proved
decisive. Compare east with west Germany; south with north Korea; Chile with
Peru; or Taiwan with mainland China. Policy matters. That is why governments
matter too.
The principal purpose of international economic institutions is to reconcile
the politics of nation states with their international interests and
obligations. With this in mind, the international economic regime of the
future should ideally cover five areas:
monetary and financial stability;
economic development;
trade and investment;
the environment; and
migration.
In each case, the aim should be to try to minimise government and maximise
the play of the market. This is not just a question of ideology. It is a
practical matter. The capacity to co-operate is limited. It should be
hoarded, just like any other globally scarce resource.
Monetary and financial stability. The Bretton Woods monetary regime was a
brilliant failure: brilliant, because of the exceptional economic progress
that occurred during its heyday, and failure, because it collapsed in the
early 1970s. The lesson, underlined by the breakdown of the hard ERM during
the summer of 1993, is that adjustable-peg exchange rate regimes are
inherently unstable without extensive exchange controls.
Yet floating exchange rates have been far from an unalloyed success. Real
exchange rate variability has been far greater than many had hoped. For this
reason, the attractions of fixed exchange rates and target-zone regimes are
substantial. But this is a point at which the objectives of states clash
with international economic aspirations. Maybe a decade or two of sustained
low inflation and fiscal discipline in important economies (neither of which
is to be taken for granted) will allow the formation of a common monetary
policy in the leading economies. At present, this is a fantasy. So too is
the hope for an agreement on equilibrium real exchange rates and a
willingness to back them up with policy changes.
Floating exchange rates may not be ideal, but they have proved workable.
They will also remain in operation for the foreseeable future. If correct,
this leaves the IMF with no more than a marginal role in international
monetary affairs.
As financial markets become more global, domestic supervision becomes
increasingly difficult. A global supervisor is one possibility. A more
plausible alternative, however, is greater supervision by the market. The
right policy would be a determined assault on the sources of moral hazard,
such as deposit insurance, combined with provision of more timely
information to the marketplace.
Economic development. There is no great mystery about what makes for
successful economic development. The recipe consists of well-motivated
people, operating within the global market, under the aegis of a supportive
and fiscally self-disciplined government. Unfortunately, such states are
rare. In their presence, international assistance is helpful, but marginal.
Developing countries that meet such criteria now have little difficulty
obtaining resources from the private markets. In their absence, assistance
is almost doomed to failure.
It is this grim reality that critics of the World Bank and IMF fail to
confront. The legitimate criticism of those institutions is not that they
have been too tough, but that they have far too weak in supporting member
governments that have neither the capacity nor the intention to do as they
have promised. States become bankrupt financially because they are already
bankrupt ideologically and politically. One of the greatest challenges
facing the world community consists in dealing with such situations.
Professor Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University has argued persuasively for an
international bankruptcy procedure. On the economic side, that could be
placed under the management of a reformed IMF. But there will often need to
be a security arrangement as well. One possibility would be to reinstate the
idea of a UN protectorate.
Meanwhile, an uncomfortable overlap between the functions of the World Bank
and the IMF remains, with both increasingly concentrated upon a number of
relatively unsuccessful states. They must at least be forced to co-operate
still more closely.
International Trade and Investment. The World Trade Organisation, whose
power rests upon agreements embodied in the domestic law of its members,
should take pride of place in trade. It would also make sense to nest
international agreements on investment within the WTO. Otherwise, the agenda
is clear enough: to liberalise further on the course already set, which may
well require another trade round later this decade.
Environment. A case can be made for an international environmental regime,
housed within a global environmental organisation. One aim would be to bring
together all the existing environmental treaties. Another would be to
protect world trade from the intrusion of environmental considerations. The
most important aim, however, would be to ensure that international
environmental overspills are handled by a consistent set of global rules
that carry over into domestic policy.
The starting point should be the 'polluter pays' principle. Its main value
would be to reveal that industrial countries are the main polluters. The US,
for example, generates a quarter of global output of carbon dioxide from
fossil fuels and cement manufacture. Correspondingly, industrial counties
must pay most for their disproportionate exploitation of the global commons.
Migration. At present, there is no policy on the treatment of international
flows of people, though there is such a policy for flows of both goods and
services. This is an obvious anomaly. A host of questions - such as taxation
of the brain drain or treatment of guest workers - should be covered.
This then is the agenda for the G7. But it cannot exclude the G7 itself. Is
there to be any overarching body charged with global economic co-ordination
and co-operation and, if so, should it be the informal G7 or something
broader or more formal?
There is, in fact, a strong case for keeping the G7, while using any
relevant international organisation to support it. One consequence of a
world of unequal sovereign states is that it is also an undemocratic one.
What is needed is responsible leadership. Leadership can only be provided by
those with the resources and the influence to exercise it. At present, that
is principally the G7, though in time its membership will have to change, as
the world economy does. The challenge, however, is also to act responsibly.
It was difficult enough in the past. Now that the cold war is over and huge
upheavals lie ahead, it may prove still more difficult in future. G7
leaders, be warned.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Next steps in Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The news from Sinn Fein is, as ever, dire. The political wing of the Irish
Republican Army announced, after lengthy deliberations on Sunday, that
sections of the joint Irish-British peace declaration of December 1993 were
'negative and contradictory'. It could not, it said, accept what it called
the 'Unionist veto' on a united Ireland. It declined to promise that IRA
terrorism would cease, so that points of difference could be debated at the
conference table. Clearly the IRA/Sinn Fein is fixated on the idea that,
since it cannot persuade a majority of the people of Ulster to accept the
governance of the Republic of Ireland, it must persist in its attempts to
bomb them into submission. This strategy of the 'armed struggle' has failed
for 25 years. It will fail even if it continues for another quarter of a
century.
There will not be peace until the IRA understands this. Sinn Fein leaders
are adept propagandists. They talk misleadingly of a 'new phase in the peace
process' while they simultaneously decline to call an end to violence. They
are not, however, shrewd judges of the British character. The public is
horrified at the long run of atrocities perpetrated by the IRA and, in
recent years, the 'loyalist' paramilitaries. This does not mean that a
policy of cut and run would be tolerated. The contrary is true. Any British
government, of whatever colour, that left the people of Ulster in a state of
chaos and civil war would be held in deep contempt. Its survival in office
would be in doubt.
Democratic basis
The search for a political solution must therefore continue. The joint
declaration provides a democratic basis for such a solution. Its cardinal
principle is self-determination. Any party that wants a united Ireland must
persuade a majority of the people of Ulster, as of the republic, to accept
it. It is this principle that sticks in Sinn Fein's throat. So be it. The
British and Irish governments should move quickly towards a new
constitutional settlement.
The other participants in this process are Northern Ireland parties that
have renounced violence and are willing to attend talks. In essence this
excludes the Unionist party led by the Reverend Ian Paisley as well as Sinn
Fein. Progress towards a 'framework agreement' has been delayed for too long
while waiting for the IRA to renounce violence and the Paisleyites to join
the negotiations. Mr John Major could make this clear to Mr Paisley today.
What is required now is a willingness on the part of all those who are in
the talks to take risks. Each party to the process knows the leap of faith
that is required; none has yet demonstrated a willingness to make the jump.
The Ulster Unionists led by Mr James Molyneaux would assist if they
entertained proposals for cross-border co-operation. Mr John Hume's mainly
Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party should abandon the illusion that
it can influence Sinn Fein. The details of Mr Hume's agreement with Mr Gerry
Adams, president of Sinn Fein, should be published. It might expose the
emptiness of the latter's protestations.
Clear statement
The British government could assist by presenting a draft amendment of the
Government of Ireland Act. That would have to include a clear statement of
intent to transfer sovereignty over Ulster should its people wish it. Such a
statement would constitute a guarantee that Britain means what it says about
self-determination. In return, the Irish government would be asked to bring
forward counterpart amendments to articles 2 and 3 of the republic's
constitution, so that the aspiration for a united Ireland contained in them
would be tempered by phraseology to the effect that Ulster is recognised to
be part of the United Kingdom unless its people decide otherwise.
This last leap forward may be the most difficult for any of the parties
concerned. All Irish political parties save Sinn Fein accept the
Irish-British joint declaration. So does an overwhelming majority of the
Irish people. Singling out the proposition that Ulster can decide on its own
is, however, risky. Putting it to a referendum might backfire. People in the
republic are uneasy when accused of leaving their northern cousins in the
lurch. Yet if the peace process is to be accelerated, someone has to make
the first move. If not the taoiseach, who?

FT  26 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Mandate to change
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Many have tried, few have come closer. Unlike his predecessors, President
Bill Clinton still has a chance of reforming America's health system.
Congress might, just might, send him an American Health Security Act by the
end of the year. During the next few weeks, Mr Clinton must fight to keep it
worthy of the name.
Unveiling his health reform package in February, Mr Clinton vowed to veto
any bill which did not secure health coverage for the 16 per cent of
Americans currently uninsured. Six months of Congressional bargaining later,
the detail of the plan is dead. But various incarnations have survived,
clearing the way for votes in both Houses by the middle of August. The
administration has a few weeks to reconcile them, not merely with one
another, but with the president's earlier promise.
The reasons to reform the US health system are as compelling now as they
were when Mr Clinton was elected. Though 37m people - one-third of them
children - are uninsured, healthcare consumes a fast-growing 14.4 per cent
of the country's GDP, far more than in other rich nations. Thanks to an
inequitable mix of government benefit programmes and tax exemptions, the
federal budget deficit takes much of the strain.
Untangling this mess means finding a way to contain costs, extend coverage,
and reverse the effect on the deficit. At bottom, that means greater
government oversight, less opulent health insurance packages, and higher
taxes. All of these measures would be unpopular. Were Mr Clinton starting
afresh, for example, a system of government-purchased universal health
insurance, funded by a new value-added-tax, would be the best choice. But he
is not.
Fewer savings
Instead, Mr Clinton backed a form of market-friendly regulation to slow down
costs. Though his own version has been much diluted, 'managed competition'
of some form may survive, though it will deliver fewer cost savings than
initially hoped. By itself, it will also deliver less in the way of wider
insurance coverage.
'Universal', or close to universal, coverage will not be achieved without,
first, requiring the purchase of insurance and, second, providing subsidies
to those who cannot currently afford it on their own. Mr Clinton's way of
approaching this was a mandate forcing companies to insure all of their
employees, with the employer meeting the bulk of the costs. Another, more
promising, approach was to place the mandate on individuals.
Mid-term election
Both proposals are all but dead in Congressional terms, at least as far as
the first wave of reform is concerned. With a difficult mid-term election in
prospect, Congress looks set to defer the tricky revenue-raising which
either proposal implies until the turn of the century. If a milder batch of
reforms and subsidies has not brought 'universal' coverage by then, Congress
may or may not be forced to take more radical steps.
Much breath has been wasted on what 'universal' should mean. Outside a
British or Canadian-style system, coverage will never be absolute. Mr
Clinton indicated last week that 95 per cent of the population might be
considered adequate, but then seemed to backtrack. Clearly, a compromise is
in order. But the administration will lessen its chances of success if it
continues to look so confused.
None of America's most lasting social reforms has been passed by a narrow,
scrambled vote in Congress. The president rightly fears that his bid for
posterity will be shaky if he does not win a safe margin of support for the
final bill. Nevertheless, there are two reasons why he should hold out for a
bill with a firm timetable for achieving close to universal coverage, even
if the timetable ends up longer than planned.
One is political: a messy fudge of his earlier promise would only add to the
view that he lacks determination in the face of opposition. The second is
more substantial. Not all Americans may be convinced that the crisis is as
deep as he thinks. But most accept the need for change. If the concerns of
the uninsured are not allied with this broader momentum, history suggests
that their situation will receive even less generous attention in years to
come.

The casualty list after last week's musical chairs in John Major's

victim, Tim Sainsbury tells Observer he asked to go.
He is now 62 and has spent 11 unbroken years in government, so Sainsbury
decided that four years at the department of trade and industry was enough.
Intriguingly, he says he also yearned for some freedom to speak out against
Sunday trading laws - which might make for some interesting chats with the
rest of the Sainsbury family.

Yukio Sato, president of Yamaichi Bank in Switzerland, is laudably
unsentimental about the panoply of Japanese vases and lacquerware lining his
shelves.
In fact, he would like to call a halt to the collection now, and with it the
age-old bond market ritual whereby investment bank and borrower exchange
lavish gifts at the signing ceremony after the completion of an issue.
Last month, he secured the co-operation of Pigeon Corp, a Japanese baby-care
products group, to waive the gifts and to join Yamachi in a donation to the
Swiss Red Cross instead. Last week, Goldwin, a Japanese sportswear maker,
followed suit.
Sato says he can still see a purpose in bestowing prezzies on a first-time
client, but from now on will try to push repeat issuers down the charitable
route. Only snag is, with heart-warming ideas like these, has Yamaichi
kissed good-bye to the notion of winning a mandate from Vendome, makers of
those posh Mont Blanc pens?

Does Observer detect a more than usual degree of smugness at the Treasury?
Before he left for pastures new, Michael Portillo drew up a detailed
assessment of the scope for cost savings around Whitehall. Wasteful and
inefficient use of resources at the Department of Employment was one of the
former chief secretary's gripes, and he highlighted the ministry's Pounds
3.5bn annual budget as a prime candidate for the scythe during the autumn
spending round. Now that the ultra-dry Portillo is getting a squint at that
supposed profligacy from the boss's seat, his first decision will be to drop
his predecessor's demand for extra funding and instead to oblige with
substantial cuts. Or, if not, his erstwhile colleagues will want to know
why.

Phantom withdrawals are one thing, but automated teller machines can spread
alarm in other ways too.
One Friday recently, the customer of a Lisbon bank was attempting to extract
cash from her local hole-in-the-wall. She reckoned her account was a few
thousand escudos in the black, and was consequently a trifle taken aback
when the machine lighted up the happy news that she was overdrawn - to the
tune of Es88m (Pounds 352,000).
Had her handbag not been stolen some days before, she might have seen the
amusing side.
As it was, the fact that she had cancelled her stolen cheques and bank cards
was scant comfort as she waited to quiz a real live teller the following
Monday. 'An eighty-eight million overdraft?' he enquired nonchantly. 'Oh,
that's just our code to indicate your cheques have been cancelled.'

<TEXT>
Securing the presidency of the European Commission was the least of Jacques
Santer's problems. Far from being able to craft a fresh team, he looks set
to inherit a lot of familiar faces - quite apart from the ticklish matter of
adjudicating between member states with some firm ideas regarding the
remaining slots to be filled.
As many as eight Commissioners could be staying on, some pressing for bigger
and better jobs. These would include Manuel Marin, the Spaniard in charge of
development policy, and Henning Christophersen, who handles economic and
monetary policy. Having been in situ since 1985 and 1986 respectively, they
seem to be becoming more-or-less permanent fixtures, alongside German
industry commissioner Martin Bangemann.
Others likely to remain in town for the new five-year term include Karel Van
Miert, in charge of competition policy, Joao Deus de Pinheiro, the laid-back
Portuguese commissioner in charge of audiovisual and information policy and
Marcelino Oreja, the Spaniard who has just arrived to take over energy and
transport.
Then of course there is the plum job of chief EU trade negotiator, currently
inhabited by Sir Leon Brittan. He must fight the French, who want him out.
But, if he hangs on successfully, France would demand the competition or
industry portfolios as recompense.
EU enlargement complicates the new man's job still further. If all goes to
plan, the Santer Commission would increase from 17 to 21 members, but Norway
and Sweden only hold their referendums in November, while Santer is supposed
to present his team to parliament for vetting in October. If he misses this
date, he will hand the newly-emboldened MEPs just the opportunity they need
to wade in with their own opinions.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Happy hoteliers, do not disturb: Visitors to Hong Kong are
filling more rooms, but can the good times last
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Later this year, Hong Kong's Peninsula Hotel will open its extension, a
30-floor tower with two helicopter pads for guests to make flying visits to
factories in southern China.
Rooms in the Peninsula's HKDollars 1.6bn tower will have bedside reading
lamps designed by Boeing, which focus light so precisely that insomniac
guests can read without disturbing their bed mates. Sanyo, the Japanese
electronic company, has designed facsimile machines for the bedrooms which
are completely silent. A small bedside light indicates that a fax has
arrived.
Rival Hong Kong hoteliers are amused by the grandiosity of some of the
Peninsula's new features. Like the Peninsula, however, they believe they
stand to benefit from the growth in visitors to Hong Kong - both leisure
tourists and business travellers using the territory as a base to do
business in China's rapidly growing markets.
Tourism has overtaken electronics to become Hong Kong's second biggest
export earner after textiles. Last year, 8.9m people visited the territory,
spending HKDollars 60m (Pounds 5bn).
Mr Stephen Wong, a spokesman for the Hong Kong Tourist Association, predicts
that tourism will eventually be the territory's biggest foreign exchange
earner, as textile manufacturers move their factories to China.
Some in the hotel and tourist industry admit that they do not know what will
happen after 1997, when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese control. Most, however,
say they are confident the territory's tourist upturn will continue. The
tourist association expects 15m people to visit Hong Kong annually by the
turn of the century.
While the territory has been, and will continue to be, a base for business
travellers visiting China, there has also been a large increase in Chinese
tourists to Hong Kong. Until 1992, the tourist association did not include
Chinese visitors in its statistics; most Chinese visitors had their trips
paid for by Hong Kong relatives and were not seen as contributing to the
local economy.
Now, however, Chinese visitors are increasingly funding their own trips.
Last year 1.7m Chinese residents visited the territory, an increase of 51
per cent on 1992. China now provides Hong Kong with more tourists than any
country apart from Taiwan.
The health of the tourist industry resulted in hotel occupancy in Hong Kong
last year averaging 87 per cent, compared with 74 per cent in London, the
most buoyant European tourist city.
Business has not always been as easy for Hong Kong's hoteliers. In the late
1980s and early 1990s, the territory witnessed a rapid increase in hotel
building. In 1988, the tourist association had 65 member hotels. By 1992,
there were 86.
The building upturn coincided, however, with a sharp slowdown in the growth
of Hong Kong tourism. Like hotels elsewhere in the world, Hong Kong
establishments were hit by the Gulf war and the onset of recession in the US
and western Europe.
But unlike their competitors in other regions, Hong Kong's hoteliers had to
contend with another setback: the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989, which
severely shook confidence in the territory.
Since 1989, however, visitor numbers have risen by 67 per cent. Last year,
tourist arrivals increased by 11.6 per cent. In the first three months of
this year, they were up 8.2 per cent over the same period in 1993.
This poses a problem for the territory's tourist officials: where to
accommodate them all. Mr Wong believes tourism is set to grow more quickly
than the supply of hotel rooms. By 1997, the tourist association expects
Hong Kong to have 35,000 hotel rooms, only 1,500 more than it has today.
While hotels such as the Peninsula are adding new rooms, other hotels have
been pulled down to make way for office blocks. In a territory where land is
in such short supply, offices provide an even better rate of return than
hotels.
In January, Ladbroke, the UK leisure group which owns the Hilton
International chain, agreed to give up the management of its hotel in the
territory in return for a payment of Dollars 125m from Hutchison Whampoa,
the Hong Kong conglomerate which owns the building. Hoteliers expect the
Hilton to be pulled down to make way for an office complex, although this
could include a new hotel as well.
The slow growth in room numbers is good news for existing hotels, which
should be able to raise rates as visitor numbers grow. It is a less welcome
development for Hong Kong, which needs accommodation for its tourists.
The construction of a new airport, currently the subject of negotiations
between the UK and China, could provide a solution. Tourist officials see
the airport as the centre of new hotel developments, similar to those that
surround London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports.
Despite their high occupancy levels, hotels in central Hong Kong do have
problems, particularly with staffing. The difficulty is not the quality of
staff: hoteliers with experience around the world say Hong Kong staff are
more committed and harder-working than employees they have managed anywhere
else.
The difficulty is recruiting them and persuading them to stay. Until a
decade ago, Hong Kong employees stayed with the same hotel for years. Mr
Michael Hoffmann, the Peninsula's manager, says the hotel's oldest employee
started at the hotel as a 12-year-old page boy when it opened in 1928. He
now works in the banqueting department.
Today, however, young people in Hong Kong are increasingly mobile. Hong Kong
hotels report annual staff turnover of 30 or 40 per cent. Mr Seamus McManus,
general manager of the Mandarin Oriental, says there is stiff competition
for staff from other service industries, such as retailing and banking.
Hotel employees frequently leave to set up their own service businesses -
driving taxis or cleaning carpets.
Mr Jurgen Wolter, manager of the Hyatt Regency, who has worked in Hong Kong
for 25 years, says: 'In 1969, if a position as a waiter or a cook became
vacant, you would have 20 people waiting outside. Today, if you have 20
positions vacant, you would be lucky to have one person applying.'
One answer would be to employ staff from elsewhere, but restrictions on
immigrants from China and elsewhere in Asia are tight and are expected to
remain so after 1997.
High staff turnover means hotels have to spend more time training new
employees than they do in other countries. Mr McManus says the Mandarin
Oriental employs seven full-time trainers. In other parts of the world, he
says, hotels might employ one or two, or pay an outside company to train
staff.
Another problem confronting hoteliers is what they see as the declining
standard of English in the territory. As 1997 approaches, Hong Kong school
pupils are spending more time on Mandarin and less on English. While this
might be understandable from a political point of view, Hong Kong's
hoteliers say it makes it much more difficult for them to serve their
guests. Even after Hong Kong reverts to Chinese control, they say, the
language of international business will still be English.
Mr Wong, whose wife teaches English at a Hong Kong secondary school, says
that, while he agrees there has been a decline in standards of English, the
deterioration is small.
Mr McManus says, however, that the situation is so serious that hotels might
have to think about installing staff language laboratories to improve
employees' English.
Deteriorating language skills, however, are unlikely to deter visitors,
particularly when general service standards are so high. Continued political
stability in the territory will be of far greater importance to the
continued growth of Hong Kong's tourist industry. Local hoteliers are
praying it will continue.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Bulls, bombs, Brussels: Patrick de Jacquelot gives an
outsider's view on the City of London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK DE JACQUELOT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is something wrong with the City of London? After successful modernisation
at the end of the 1980s, which put it firmly among the world's three leading
financial centres, along with New York and Tokyo, London has faced several
serious problems in the past few years. Thanks to its strengths, the City
does not seem to have been undermined by these difficulties. But various
dangers, mostly linked to the role of the UK in Europe, lie ahead.
For a French financial journalist being assigned to London in 1990, there
was no doubt that here was a remarkable success story: a truly international
financial centre with a significant share of the market in cross-border
dealings and a record number of foreign banks. London was the obvious model
for continental centres such as Paris, wishing to modernise themselves.
Technical difficulties, lack of professionalism or even dishonest practices
were not thought to be a problem in the financial capital of Europe.
And yet, in the past four years, important City institutions have been hit
by setbacks. Lloyd's, the insurance market, has seen huge losses; the Stock
Exchange's Taurus settlement project collapsed; the pound was forced out of
Europe's exchange rate mechanism; the Bank of England was slow to close down
BCCI. Financial scandals involving Robert Maxwell and Polly Peck tarnished
some banks, auditors and regulators. In addition, the City had to contend
with an IRA security problem.
After such blows, its reputation is no longer at its highest. London has
shown it is as accident prone as everybody else and has suffered to some
extent from its own success. Financial scandals happen everywhere but are
all the more shocking in a market supposed to be an example for the rest of
the world. At its darkest hour, in 1992, it looked as if the future was
bleak indeed. But two years later, the role of London as a leading financial
centre has not been substantially weakened.
A striking factor for the foreign observer is the way the City reacted.
Lloyd's is undergoing radical reform, as in a less conspicuous manner is the
Bank of England. The Maxwell scandal led to an overhaul of the pensions
system and the Square Mile is now ring-fenced against terrorism. According
to Robert Amzallag, managing director of Banque Nationale de Paris in London
and chairman of the Foreign Bank Association in Britain, those who lead the
City 'are watching very closely for any emerging problem. They have no
long-term plan, but they react quickly when necessary'.
How does the City view itself? Its assets, of course, are still here. The
English language makes London the natural home in Europe for American and
Japanese institutions. 'London has the labour supply, markets already
established with excellent liquidity, and supporting services like law and
accounting,' says Professor Richard Brealey, who is leading the City
Research Project, a study of London as a financial centre by the London
Business School for the Corporation of London. Foreign banks share this
view. According to Peter Letley, deputy chairman of HSBC Investment Banking
Group which recently moved to London, 'the level of expertise available here
is wider and greater than in any other European market'.
At the end of the day, says Rupert Pennant-Rea, deputy-governor of the Bank
of England, it is the capacity of London to 'accommodate innovation' that
was and will be the main factor in its success.
While the City is convinced it has overcome the hurdles of the early 1990s,
some concerns are acknowledged. 'London only needs a major regulatory
mistake for business to move elsewhere,' warns Sir Peter Middleton, chairman
of BZW, the investment banking arms of Barclays bank.
Many in the City feel that the biggest danger comes from Brussels. 'The
drive of the European Commission to harmonise is a danger to us because our
dealings are much more complex than on the continent,' says Stanislas
Yassukovich, chairman of the investment firm Cragnotti and Partners, who
chairs the City Research Project.
A European problem the City does not take seriously is the threat to its
eminence from Frankfurt or Paris. Michael Lawrence, chief executive of the
Stock Exchange, is clear that these two markets have an important role to
play at the 'regional' level, but London will remain the only international
centre.
With such self-confidence in the City, the foreign observer is occasionally
irritated by a whiff of complacency. The Lord Mayor of London, Sir Paul
Newall, recently spoke disdainfully of 'the political decision to locate 300
bureaucrats and regulators' in Frankfurt, referring to the creation of the
European Monetary Institute, the precursor of a European central bank. His
stance sits uneasily with the efforts deployed by the corporation and the UK
government to bring the EMI to London.
The main development which could jeopardise the City would be the creation
of a single European currency without the UK. The choice of Frankfurt for
the EMI 'is a threat. There are foreign banks here because we are part of
Europe,' says Sir Brian Pearse, former chief executive of Midland Bank. 'If
Britain is marginalised in Europe, things can change. The American and
Japanese banks could not afford not to be in Frankfurt.'
Were a single European currency to exclude the UK, there would not be an
instant exodus from the City, but the main firms would have to reconsider
their position.
Whatever efforts were deployed to address the problems, the City might still
see its role as Europe's financial capital endangered by a marginalisation
of the UK in the European Union. Sooner or later, Britain will have to
decide whether it goes along with the building of an 'ever closer union'.
Unless it can, the unique achievement of the City in becoming a truly
international financial centre could still be the victim of politics.

since 1990, is returning to Paris this summer

FT  26 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Foreign investment in UK not all
positive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr JIM HAMILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Andrew Baxter presents an accurate account of the recent annual report
of the Invest in Britain Bureau ('Foreign groups create record total of
jobs', July 22). Unfortunately, the IBB report itself presents a totally
misleading picture of the employment effects of inward direct investment in
the UK. The employment data quoted in the report cover jobs promised by
inward investors rather than jobs actually created and take no account of
the jobs lost as a consequence of foreign investments from the UK.
Furthermore, to argue that 30,000 jobs were saved as a consequence of BMW's
acquisition of Rover is surely difficult to substantiate as it assumes that
all of these jobs would have been lost if the acquisition had not taken
place and that there will be no job losses post-acquisition.
I would agree with industry secretary, Michael Heseltine, that 'thousands of
people are at work today because of our success at attracting inward
investment'. However, I would also point out that thousands of people are
out of work today because of foreign divestments from the UK, and numerous
examples could be quoted. I would also point out that the job security of
thousands of people is being threatened as a consequence of the recent wave
of foreign acquisitions in the UK.
Since 1985, there has been a total of 1,278 foreign acquisitions in the UK,
valued at Pounds 31bn. Many of the UK's largest industrial and commercial
enterprises have passed into foreign ownership as a consequence of being
externally acquired - Rover, Midland Bank, Beecham, Rowntree, Jaguar, Pearl
Group, Yorkshire Bank etc. Preliminary results of research being conducted
by SIBU suggest that the employment effects of inward investment in the form
of acquisitions may be negative.
The British government is unique in viewing such foreign takeovers as a sign
of confidence in British competitiveness and, given the scale of acquisition
activity, there is an urgent need for detailed study of the long-term
effects on the British economy of external takeovers.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Voting against the means, not the end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From TOM SPENCER MEP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The European Parliament's rejection of the draft legislation to
liberalise voice telephony was no 'Euro folly' (Editorial, July 21) at all.
My colleagues and I were not voting against the opening up of this market,
but against the way the Council had sent us a text which left subsequent
amending legislation in the hands of technical committees meeting in secret.
The Commission can now bring forward a virtually identical proposal which
will meet this point of principle, and can be dealt with at speed without
compromising the liberalisation timetable. Governments cannot run away from
the logic of the Maastricht treaty. This, as the FT has explained on a
number of occasions, changed the balance of power between the Council and
parliament.
Tom Spencer,
chairman, Conservatives in the European parliament,
Strasbourg
From Mr Mel Read MEP.
Sir, Your leader 'Euro Follies' gives a less than adequate analysis of the
complex issues surrounding the European parliament's rejection of the
Council's position on voice telephony liberalisation.
The Parliament has made it absolutely clear that on the substance of voice
telephony liberalisation there is broad agreement between Council,
Commission and Parliament. On points of disagreement, considerable progress
was made towards acceptable compromises during the conciliation procedure.
On the dreaded question of comitology (the process by which European
legislation is implemented and reviewed - the rough equivalent of statutory
instruments in the UK), there was no compromise. Parliament is demanding
equivalence of treatment: where Council has a second bite at legislation, so
should the European Parliament. What the Council wants is exclusive control
over implementing measures stemming from the directive. This principle is
relevant to dozens of legislative proposals, and an urgent
intra-institutional agreement is needed to settle the matter.
As the rapporteur on voice telephony, I proposed an ad hoc solution on
comitology and voice telephony, but Council would not budge.
Your leader says: 'With luck, the telecommunications package can be
reassembled soon'. I made it clear in the European Parliament that we will
do all in our power to facilitate this. It is not the European Parliament
setting its face against economic progress, as you allege, but the Council
of Ministers' refusal to accept the democratic principles of the Maastricht
treaty signed by the same Council. Mel Read (Labour, Nottingham &amp; Leics NW),

FT  26 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Potential of hydro-power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr T L SHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Roland Adburgham's review ('MPs back wind farms for Wales', July 21) of
the Welsh affairs committee's report on wind farms in Wales picks up issues
which prompt me to point out that local interest in hydro-power schemes
differs sharply from that in wind. For example, modern hydro schemes are
essentially below ground and so do not visually intrude on the landscape;
their economics are improving to the point where state subsidies are not
needed; and investment is becoming increasingly indigenous.
Furthermore, there is potential for many schemes of a size sufficient to
meet nearby demands. Renewable energy sources are as variable in their
implications as those regarded as conventional.

<TEXT>
Sir, I was rather disturbed to read in the People column (July 21) the
comments on Ishbel Macpherson's appointment at Hoare Govett to shake up its
smaller company corporate finance activities.
Your writer seemed to feel that women make a habit of 'swanning off on
maternity leave at the drop of a hat', and that views on children expressed
four years ago were worthy of comment, given her new role.
I found these comments, however humorously meant, very offensive,
particularly in a newspaper such as the Financial Times. They encapsulate an
attitude which women encounter all too frequently in their working lives.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Happy contrast - but objective?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RODNEY LEACH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, According to Ian Davidson ('Too late to kiss it better', July 30), the
government is in 'craven submission' to the Eurosceptics, whose attitude is
of 'ill-tempered obstructionism' reliant on the 'atavistic rhetoric' of
'xenophobic nationalism'. This has led to the 'incomprehensible' squandering
of our credit by 'single-handedly precipitating a gratuitous and futile
crisis' over the presidency of the Commission.
By happy contrast, there is the 'gathering momentum' of the 'logic' of a
'new phase' of building Europe, 'irresistibly led' by Germany and embraced
by Mr Tony Blair with 'rational serenity'.
Could it be possible that Mr Davidson has mislaid his objectivity somewhere?

FT  26 JUL 94 / Arts: Thomas Ades - a special talent / Almeida Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For its last concert on Sunday, the Almeida Festival chose to give us
something quite open-ended, not conclusive at all: a sampling of the music
of Thomas Ades, with himself as pianist, four other performers and other
music of his own choice.
Young Ades is a recent Cambridge product - a double-starred First in music,
in fact (we shall not mention that again); much feted in Cambridge, and
therefore more widely. A general conviction that there is a rare talent
here, though still finding its feet, is supported by his extreme finesse at
the keyboard.
Like several other critics I was greatly taken by his Park Lane Group
recital last year, which included his Still Sorrowing: a most delicately
calculated and imaginative piece for 'prepared' piano, with ambitions well
beyond a clever exercise. Sunday's Almeida concert, however, left us
tantalised.
Of the non-Ades music, John Woolrich's Light and Rock songs on Yugoslav folk
poems were astringent and effective, with roots alike in Britten and in
Berio's Folk Songs. Two Conlon Nancarrow canons, delivered by Ades with
uncanny precision, were as deeply unsettling as Nancarrow's studies always
are. (Until you've heard some Nancarrow, you don't know how radically your
ears can be twisted.) The reduced suite from Stravinsky's Soldier's Tale,
with a terrific violinist in Anthony Marwood, fairly crackled. Only Per
Norgaard's Lin stood somewhat apart in this programme of lean music; its
sober, neo-romantic expansiveness needed different ears from the rest.
But Ades himself? Well: he exhibited three quite disparate works. Five Eliot
Landscapes was one, for very high soprano - soprano in altissimo: the
Canadian Valdine Anderson floated and sculpted her Straussian lines
exquisitely, over intricate, multi-fingered whispers from the Ades piano.
She reappeared to sing 'Love Me', a delectable 1930s pastiche which will
wind through an Ades opera due next year at the Almeida. Finally we had
Catch, a one-off tour de force in which the official scenario - a clarinet
teased, rejected, and then welcomed and absorbed by the other instruments -
was realised in musical terms that went well beyond the simple joke.
All these pieces were musical mousetraps: intricate mechanisms, eccentric
but very carefully determined, which in due course sprang the traps that
were their point. Very clever exercises, and original; the fine-spun detail
answers perfectly to his guiding intentions. We shall have to wait for more
and larger Ades music, nonetheless, to discover how much more he has to say.
So far, his is evidently a special talent.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Arts: 'White Nights' in St Petersburg - The city is
witnessing both the death and renaissance of classicism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
St Petersburg, built as Russia's window on the west, is History City. It is
not as old as Moscow, or as Russian; but its whole essence - layout,
architecture, statuary, ornamentation - is classical. Every foreign visitor
is bound to notice this, and every Petersburger is steeped in it. But what
is it like to live a modern life in a classical city?
The immense irony of living there struck me on my first visit, ten years
ago, for the White Nights festival. Along the canals and the embankments of
the River Neva, in front of the palaces whose colours become strangely
luminous in the midnight light of late June, numbers of old men stood, for
long hours, fishing to supplement their limited groceries.
The contrast of old and new appeared so great, in the Leningrad of 1984,
that I wondered why the Russian communists had not adopted a Maoist attitude
to history and destroyed the monuments that so reproached their daily lives.
And yet the government was still spending fortunes on gradually repairing
the damage done to the city by the German siege in the second world war, and
old women queued for hours - with none of the quick-admission privileges
granted to foreign tourists  - to enter the city's most richly adorned
interiors.
On revisiting the city for the White Nights of 1994, now that it has
regained its original name of St Petersburg, I found a new set of ironies.
Cindy Crawford's photograph hangs large in Nevsky Prospect (the city's main
street); the city's trams bear Rothman's adverts (in English); the great
Palace Square on one side of the Hermitage was occupied, for one long
weekend, by an Adidas softball promotional display. Russians no longer have
to queue for hours, either to enter the Hermitage or to buy groceries.
Whether they can afford to buy groceries any more is another matter. There
are far fewer fishermen, but many more beggars. And the city is dirtier,
dustier.
Everyone today seems happy that the city has been re-named St Petersburg.
Nonetheless, though Lenin's name is no longer ubiquitous, his statues still
stand in many places around the city. He too is part of history, and
accepted as such. The guides refer to the more grim aspects of the communist
regime in the same tones that they discuss the darker episodes of life under
the Tsars.
The truth is that life in so classical a city was always ironic: as reading
Dostoyevsky should remind one. From my hotel to the city centre, I would
walk each day routes that had been taken by the leading characters of The
Idiot during their most distraught episodes. We tend to think of classicism
as something measured, formal, Apollonian; and this side of St Petersburg is
obvious enough. But classicism, in Petersburg as in Ancient Greece, is large
enough also to contain wildness, morbidity, despair.
The Kirov (or Maryinsky) Ballet, however, is no longer a classical company -
if we are to use the word 'classical' in any serious sense. There comes a
point, alas, when the true classicism of some ballet companies declines into
hollow academicism. This happened, decades ago, in Paris to the Paris Opera
Ballet; and it is now happening, I believe, in New York to New York City
Ballet. In terms of academic distinction, these three companies are probably
the foremost in the world; and they are fed by first-rate schools (though it
is possible that Kirov Ballet's decline in style has been occurring at
school level also). Most Kirov dancers have numerous stylistic niceties in
their dancing that are not to be found in, say, the Bolshoi of Moscow; and
possibly the dancers find inspiration for some of those niceties from living
amid the architecture of St Petersburg. And yet the firm core of Kirov style
is being gradually drained away (whereas the cruder Moscow style still
retains a certain classically vital simplicity).
Just take two of the key features of classical style in ballet: musicality,
and stance. In terms of musical timing and phrasing, the Kirov has been
musically decadent for decades, especially in dictating convenient
decelerations of tempo and then ignoring the beat and phrase that they
themselves have dictated. The decline of stance is more recent. When first I
saw the company in 1982, I would have paid just to see the dancers stand,
walk, and take curtain calls; they made these simple matters radiate with
classical purity. By 1992, the dancers were standing like gymnasts, with an
anti-classical arch of the pelvis and lower spine. As a result, an
exaggerated dichotomy of upper and lower body has developed, and an element
of strain has distorted all Kirov deportment.
The death of classicism - or its chilling translation into the mere facade
of academicism - is a depressing spectacle. It has happened in other arts
and other cities, but to see it happen to St Petersburg's great ballet
company is one irony I could do without when visiting that city today. Some
observers attribute the Kirov Ballet's decline to financial and political
causes, and no doubt the company's economic situation is serious. It is
obliged to tour extensively to support itself. But the same is true for St
Petersburg's Maly Drama Theatre, which has also been touring extensively for
years now, and which, on its seven-week tour of Britain this year showed
theatrical standards of the highest calibre.
And during the very period that the ballet of the Kirov/Maryinsky Opera
House has declined, the same theatre's opera has been enjoying an
extraordinary renaissance. Truly extraordinary: for the city has not really
been a serious home for opera since the time of the Tsars. In 1984, the
Kirov Opera was not merely backwards in terms of stage production, it was
also a mess in musical terms, with only Sergei Leiferkus an exception,
casting his baritonal pearls among the surrounding swine.
Today, the company is a nonpareil model of ensemble, and it possesses solo
voices and instrumentalists of world class. Several of these singers -
Galina Gorchakova, Olga Borodina, Gegam Grigorian, Leiferkus, Vladimir
Chernov, and others - are already internationally acclaimed. Yet they keep
returning to St Petersburg, and principally because of one man - the
artistic director of the Kirov Opera, Valery Gergiev. Ten years ago, the
White Nights festival was mainly of interest to balletomanes; the best
musical evenings occurred not at the Kirov at all, but at the city's second
opera house, the Maly. Now, however, the festival is, musically, world
class. I never had the time this year to go to the Maly, because Gergiev &amp;
Co. were producing so rich a supply of great performances at the Maryinsky
(or at the Philharmonic Halls).
St Petersburg was conceived not just as a classical city but also as
Russia's window on the west. Ever since Peter the Great, the city's founder,
the debate between Europhiles and Europhobes has been a central issue in
Russian culture. Before Diaghilev brought Russian ballet and opera to the
west, he had spent years audaciously bringing western art to Russia; he also
worked hard to re-introduce Russia to overlooked aspects of Russian art. The
centre of his activities in those days was St Petersburg, which was then the
country's capital. When Moscow became the capital city again under the
communist regime, the xenophobe strain of Russian culture became uppermost
again.
Today, however, the beauty of Gergiev's work at the Maryinsky is that he is
working along Diaghilev lines. As the White Nights festival showed, the
Maryinsky today honours Russian music - not just Glinka, Rimsky-Korsakov,
and Tchaikovsky, but also Prokofiev (who returned from the west to communist
Russia), Shostakovich (who suffered under the communist regime), and
Stravinsky (who chose to remain in western exile from his native land). It
also gave performances of western repertory, from Haydn. And the
performances I heard Gergiev give of Berlioz's Damnation of Faust and
Verdi's Force of Destiny were simply the best I have ever heard. Suddenly
the window on the west is again open wide.
The history of Russian culture in this century is extremely curious. Russian
art was a galvanising force upon artistic modernism throughout the world;
and the Russian revolution was as key an event for the culture of the
observing world as the French Revolution has been for the Romantic movement.
Yet when the doctrine of Leninism-Marxism descended upon Russia, its effects
upon artistic life was stultifying, even crucifying.
Today the doctrines have lifted with remarkable speed; but it will take far
longer for their effects to disappear. St Petersburg is the most classical
city in the world, but classicism is a virtually extinct strain in world
culture. Is it to become a museum city? or something more? One watches the
fall of the Kirov Ballet with dismay, the rise of the Maly Drama Theatre and
the Kirov Opera with exhilaration. For a westerner, the most exciting fact
is simply that one can watch. Russia, which did so much to shape our
century, is gradually re-entering it; and St Petersburg - History City - is
open again to the west.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Arts: Bach's St Matthew Passion - Promenade concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a good idea to include snippets of Proms' history in the programmes
for the 100th season this year. Without consulting the 'Seasons past' page
on Sunday, who would have guessed that it took until 1968 for a piece of
music as central as Bach's St Matthew Passion to receive its first
performance in the Promenade Concerts?
In the early years Henry Wood was a keen advocate of Bach's music, but that
only led to excerpts from the score. One of the tenor aria was sung in 1907
and the celebrated alto aria 'Erbarme dich' came round once a decade, but a
complete St Matthew Passion was evidently out of the question. It is a sign
of how public appreciation of music has been raised that the St Matthew
Passion, sung in German, has become commonplace in the Britain of the 1990s.
The audience on Sunday may not have been as large as the Proms hoped, but a
two-thirds-full Royal Albert Hall at 11am on one of the hottest days of the
year is not a bad turnout. The audience to performer ratio was also balanced
in the accountants' favour, as this was very far from being the grand
Victorian choral pageant that would automatically have been offered 100
years ago.
The American conductor Joshua Rifkin was the first to argue that Bach's
choral music was originally intended to have one solo singer to a part, not
a full choir. Although the subject is still open to dispute, we have had
enough experience of small-scale Bach performances over the last decade to
come to a conclusion on the essential difference: the great choral works
become less public celebrations, more a private avowal of faith.
Having a minimal St Matthew Passion in a venue as vast as the Royal Albert
Hall might seem a bizarre experiment, but it seemed to work well enough on
Sunday. One of the pleasures of hearing eight solo singers in the choral
movements is the marvellous clarity and blend that experienced early music
singers can attain.
Rifkin led a flexible and unexaggerated performance, less fussy with rhythm
than Leonhardt, less concentrated than Gardiner. The balance was also
well-judged, despite the singers being outnumbered by the combined forces of
The Bach Ensemble (from the US) and St James's Baroque Players. John Elwes
showed sterling stamina in tackling both the Evangelist's music and some of
the solo tenor arias, though he was strained at the top; Stephen Varcoe was
a light, eloquent Christus. Among the other soloists, I enjoyed Nancy
Argenta's soprano and Mark Padmore's assertive tenor. Steven Rickards's pure
counter-tenor projected well, but he pecked at Bach's long, flowing phrases.

Westminster Bank's UK branch business, with responsibility for directing the
bank's 2,700 strong sales force, engaged in selling life insurance,
mortgages, pensions and other investments.
Poulton started his working life at British European Airways in 1963,
staying with the airline five years before joining Rothmans UK, where he was
initially a salesman, rising to become director of the company's sales
force. All told he spent 20 years at Rothmans.
Then in 1988 he joined Lloyds Abbey Life Assurance, moving in 1989 to join
Black Horse Financial Services as sales director.
The business of selling financial services has come under close scrutiny in
the UK recently. NatWest says it has decided to restructure its sales
operations in the light of regulatory and competitive changes, in order to
ensure proper emphasis on compliance and training is carried out. Poulton
will have the task of monitoring those sensitive changes.

FT  26 JUL 94 / People: Fresh partners for new strategic consultancy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Some small but significant ripples in the world of London-based management
consultancies.
The Strategic Partnership, in operation only since the beginning of this
year, under Peter Smith, 56, as its chief executive, has appointed two big
guns to its advisory board.
They are Thomas Frost, 61, former group chief executive of National
Westminster Bank, now chairman of The London Clearing House, and John
Stopford, 54, who holds the chair of international business at the London
Business School.
Besides a love of orchids, Frost carries with him a wealth of banking
experience, having first joined Westminster bank (as it then was) in 1950.
Among his many business activities, Frost was also a member of the advisory
board of the British-American chamber of commerce, between 1987-1993.
A trained engineer, Stopford first started on an academic career in 1968,
with posts at the Manchester and then Harvard business schools.
He was a non-executive director of Shell (UK) between 1973-77, but before
that had gained early hands-on business experience by managing a
Booker-McConnell subsidiary in Guyana. He has also worked for the United
Nations, and still works as a government adviser in developing countries
such as Mongolia and Thailand.
Before establishing his new consultancy, Smith was a communications
consultant with Burson-Marsteller's City and Corporate Communications
branch.
Meanwhile, Paul Thornton has left PA Consulting group and Chris French
departed Proudfoot, to found a new management consultancy, the French
Thornton Partnership. They intend focusing on companies attempting to make
greater use of information technology.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Business and the Law: Restrictions on imports lawful -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
National measures which restrict the sale of foodstuffs, including im-ported
foodstuffs, to those products which state on their labels the types of
preservatives used were held to be lawful by the European Court of Justice.
But national restrictions on the amount of salt that could be used in bread
were unlawful in that they were in breach of the EC treaty provisions on the
free movement of goods.
This preliminary ruling was given in the context of criminal proceedings
against a Belgian baker who had sold imported bread from the Netherlands and
thereby infringed Belgian law twice: first, because the bread contained a
higher percentage of salt than was permitted under the national rules; and,
secondly, because the labels on the bread indicated neither the exact
specification nor the EC number of the preservatives used, but simply stated
that the products contained food preservatives.
The Court was first asked to rule on whether the Belgian rules on the level
of salt that could be used in bread sold in Belgium were contrary to EC
treaty provisions on the free movement of goods. The Court first found that
there were no relevant EC rules on the amount of salt that could be used in
bread and, therefore, national provisions applied. The Belgian law set the
limit at 2 per cent, whereas under Dutch law salt levels of up to 2.5 per
cent were permitted. The Court found that, although there were no EC
harmonising measures, the Belgian rules did restrict imports of Dutch bread
(which was lawfully sold in Holland) and, as such, these rules were contrary
to the EC treaty provisions on the free movement of goods. The Court then
had to determine whether such restrictions could be justified on public
health grounds, as claimed by Belgian authorities.
On this question, the Court referred to its decision in the German beer
case, in which the Court had held that any alleged risk to human health
could be determined only on the basis of relevant scientific research. The
Belgian authorities, however, did not supply such evidence. They merely said
they considered the higher level of salt allowed in the Netherlands 'too
high'. Moreover, Belgium could have chosen other means of protecting
consumers than the recourse to an outright ban: appropriate labelling would
have been less of an impediment to free movement and could have ensured
sufficient protection of public health. Consequently, the Court held the
Belgian rules could not be justified under the EC treaty.
With regard to the description of preservatives on labels, the Court found
that EC rules provided that member states could require labels to contain a
full description of the preservatives used, but that this was not
compulsory. In the present case, the Belgian legislation required a full
description of preservatives used, whereas the Dutch legislation did not.
The Court was asked whether in such circumstances, the Belgian authorities
could lawfully stop bread, which was correctly labelled according to Dutch
law, from being imported into Belgium.
The Court held first that the Belgian labelling requirements were contrary
to the EC treaty provisions on the free movement of goods as they made it
more difficult to import the same goods from other member states which did
not have the same labelling requirements. The ECJ then went on to say that,
since the relevant EC labelling rules did not provide for complete
harmonisation, member states were still allowed to invoke the EC treaty
provisions or the case law of the Court to seek to try to justify the
measures in question. The Court found that for consumers to be properly
protected, they had to be in a position to know from a label what a given
product contained. Therefore, such labelling requirements as provided for in
the Belgian rules served the purpose of consumer protection, which had
already been accepted by the Court to be a mandatory requirement justifying
restrictions on the free movement of goods. The Court also found the Belgian
rules were proportionate in that they interfered much less with the free
movement of goods than other measures.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Business and the Law: A case for treatment - The use of
legal aid for multi-party medical litigation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY BARTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Difficulties encountered in large, multi-party medical and pharmaceutical
litigation highlight the problems inherent in the present system in the UK
of providing legal aid to allow such cases to come to court.
The collapse earlier this year of the largest publicly funded personal
injury claim in the country illustrates the disadvantages of the current
system. The action, brought by 5,000 claimants against Roche and Wyeth, the
manufacturers of the benzodiazepine (tranquilliser) drugs Valium and Ativan,
collapsed after six years, at an estimated cost to taxpayers of Pounds 35m.
The action fell apart when the Legal Aid Board of England and Wales withdrew
funding, saying the claims did not satisfy the requirements for legal aid.
Legal aid, according to the board, is a system of government funding for
those who cannot afford to pay for legal advice, assistance and
representation. Civil legal aid is available to those able to demonstrate
they have 'reasonable grounds' for bringing a claim and who satisfy the
stringent financial eligibility criteria. Middle-income people, therefore,
are effectively denied access to justice, however good their claim.
Even those claimants who do qualify for legal aid frequently receive no
compensation, because of the low success rate in court. Lawyers are too
often the only beneficiaries of medical and pharmaceutical litigation.
Is legal aid, then, merely a state-funded and self-serving industry which
suits lawyers as justice-mongers and purveyors of compensation?
In the benzodiazepine case, the main beneficiaries were certainly the
lawyers and experts: not a penny has been obtained for any claimant. The
irrecoverable expense to the manufacturers was also passed on to the public.
Other multi-party actions involve infant drinks, smoking, diagnostic agents,
surgical devices, various drugs and the power industry. These are invariably
legally aided, widely advertised and are conducted with much media hype.
The Legal Aid Board recently published a report on multi-party actions,
following the benzodiazepine case. It makes disturbing reading, and raises
questions over both the cost and the quality of such cases.
The board admits that it has 'doubts over the extent to which legal aid
lawyers can have regard to the costs of litigation'. And it concedes that
'there is no incentive on the solicitor to act as a responsible filter for
dubious cases, as there is no effective sanction available for shoddy work
or bad cases being taken'.
The report implies that fraud by solicitors on the legal aid fund is
'widespread', because it is not possible for the board to exercise detailed
control over all publicly funded litigation. It has to rely upon the
assisted persons' legal advisers to act responsibly and competently.
The board recognises that many funded actions are 'weak' or 'hopeless'. It
describes a 'bandwagon effect' with 'legal advisers getting carried away by
everything surrounding the action and losing sight of the viability of
individual cases'. The board acknowledges that applicants may often feel
that they have nothing to lose by giving it a go - the lawyers, however, are
paid whatever the outcome.
Contrary to popular belief, legally aided claimants against institutional or
corporate defendants enjoy a strong position.
First, they are not liable for the defendant's costs, even if they are
unsuccessful. The defendant must pay his own costs, even if successful. Thus
the plaintiff is in a no-lose position and the defendant is in a no-win
position.
The courts have expressed concern that this rule could give rise to abuse
and injustice. Lord Denning referred to the 'inequality of bargaining power'
in favour of legally aided parties. Lord Donaldson observed that 'legal aid
helps those who lose cases, not those who win them'. Most recently, the
Court of Appeal has remarked: 'It is no answer that there are public
authorities or insurance associations that are footing the bill. The
National Health Service has better things to spend its money on than
lawyers' fees.'
Second, the board relies on the advice of plaintiff lawyers in deciding
whether or not to fund a claim. Such advice by definition cannot be
independent, since the plaintiff's advisers have a financial interest in the
advancement of the claim.
Medical and pharmaceutical claims are complex, expensive and have a low
success rate. The legal and scientific issues are not readily separable. The
legal process imposes a separation of medical and legal professional roles.
Further, the legal aid area committees consist only of lawyers, and do not
contain scientists and clinicians. It is difficult to see, therefore, how
these committees are able to evaluate complex scientific issues. The board,
however, asserts that these committees are 'well positioned to form a clear
and objective opinion of the prospects of success'.
Despite using phrases such as 'shoddy work', 'weak cases', 'dubious cases',
'hopeless cases' and 'lawyers getting carried away', the board insists: 'It
is wrong to assume that the opinions based on behalf of the applicants would
give a misleading or over-optimistic assessment of a case.'
The facts, however, speak for themselves. According to an independent
survey, the success rate of legally aided pharmaceutical actions is zero.
In the benzodiazepine action, there were 3,000 Ativan claims. According to
the plaintiffs' advisers, four barristers had assessed 1,200 cases as
'strong in law' and had 'very good high prospects of success'. The Court of
Appeal, by contrast, referred to the 'considerable problems on causation . .
. distinguishing between the effects of the drug and the underlying
condition for which it was prescribed'. The court observed that 'these
considerations may present real problems in many, if not all, of the cases'.
Moreover, if only 1,200 cases were 'strong', why were proceedings started in
3,000?
Decisions involving the expenditure of millions of pounds of taxpayers'
money ought to be based on independent, objective and expert advice. There
must be independent claims assessment if public confidence in legal aid is
to be restored.
The present system is unacceptable to plaintiffs, defendants and the
taxpayer. What is required is a judicial process which is investigative,
independent, expert and integrated so as to straddle law and medicine.
The board acknowledges that courts may not be appropriate for these cases,
and proposes a tribunal consisting of a legal chairman and appropriate
medical experts. The idea is to change the process, not the basis, of
compensation.
A contingency 'no win, no fee' system, for paying solicitors according to
results in certain cases, is due to come into effect later this year. It
will widen access to justice. Far from leading to a US-style litigation
'free for all', the risk of legal costs (which does not generally apply in
America) will impose a commercial discipline, so that claims are only
advanced when properly investigated and assessed. The pursuit of hopeless
claims will remain the privilege of the rich, the foolish and the legally
aided.
Change seems inevitable. Whatever solution is adopted, there is one
certainty: any proposal to remove from lawyers the indiscriminate largesse
of the state, and impose any effective form of accountability, will be met
with howls of protest.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Going it alone - A
campaign designed to promote self-employment is about to be launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Miguel Forde lost his job as a furniture restorer he received some
second-rate suggestions about what he should do next. In particular, the
government's Restart Scheme, which tries to help the long-term unemployed,
kept trying to persuade him to take a job packing supermarket shelves.
Fortunately, the 23-year-old Forde, who was trained but lacked many formal
qualifications, had a higher opinion of his abilities. 'There is no point in
you, for example, being trained as a journalist and going to do shelf
packing,' says Forde.
He and two friends, Michael Barrett and Henroy McPherson, who lost their
jobs about the same time, tried to start their own restoration company.
After taking a business course run by Urban and Economic Development
(Urbed), which aims to regenerate run-down areas, they heard of the Prince's
Youth Business Trust, whose president and enthusiastic patron is the Prince
of Wales.
With the help of Pounds 3,000 in PYBT loans and grants they were able to set
up Michenuels of London in Deptford, south London, which is just completing
its first year.
The PYBT, says Forde, took a crucial step that should be considered by many
more people in his position. Led by Jeremy White, the new chief executive,
the PYBT is about to launch a national campaign to demonstrate that
self-employment is a real alternative to unemployment.
About 22,000 people have already got the message in the PYBT's first 10
years. Aimed at people who are disadvantaged by their educational, economic
or ethnic minority backgrounds or by physical disability, the charity has
disbursed Pounds 40m. Four thousand people receive loans and grants a year
and two-thirds of their businesses survive into their third year.
White is fond of saying the PYBT is one of the largest consultancy services
in the UK. Its 5,000 advisers give three-quarters of a million hours of free
advice a year, a factor Forde and his colleagues found exceptionally helpful
in their first year.
The PYBT's achievements have been widely recognised; in March the
government, with cross-party support, committed itself to giving the PYBT
Pounds 10m over three years if the PYBT could raise the same amount from
industry.
While the government and those captains of industry who have been touched
for a contribution may be well aware of PYBT, there is a problem. In spite
of marketing itself through Tecs, Job Centres and banks, the PYBT's message
may not be getting through to where it matters - the street.
Forde, for example, did not immediately think of the PYBT when he was
looking for backing. 'I thought you had to be some rich kid before they
thought you were worthy of them,' Forde says. Hence the marketing drive.
White is also trying to recruit more advisers. The success rate of
PYBT-backed businesses is much higher than that achieved by banks that back
small start-ups. White believes the secret is the hand-holding they receive
from advisers. But while there are plenty of volunteers in Surrey, they are
much harder to find in south London.
Longer term, White is considering trying to raise money through a
government-guaranteed eurobond issue. Such guarantees might be classified as
part of the government's public sector borrowing requirement, a problem that
has yet to be resolved.
White recognises that any future government funding will depend on the
PYBT's ability to demonstrate it is good value for money. 'The onus is on us
to understand our target market more and to show that self-employment
provides a viable alternative to unemployment.'
White is also aiming to change the PYBT's focus. He wants even more of its
funds to be disbursed as loans rather than grants - because of the
discipline this instills. More fundamentally, he wants to shift away from a
welfare role. He defines the PYBT as an 'enterprise charity' that supports
people who want to start sustainable businesses but who could not do it
alone.
'We see a lot of people who are very needy,' says White. 'There are other
channels that are better equipped to give more welfare help. We are more
interested in giving people the chance to go into enterprise.'
Already the PYBT has backed some ventures that have grown into sizeable
businesses. Its biggest success, measured in turnover terms, is a mobile
milk-testing company that has a turnover of over Pounds 6m. Others that are
growing and starting to provide employment include a business making
animated film titles, a geological surveyor, an agency recruitment for
charities and a hospital entertainment group.
What the PYBT backs is people with bright ideas and enthusiasm, White says.
'But they do not have the other dimensions that bankers could look at. No
qualifications, limited literacy and numeracy, no capital or family funds.
But being articulate is only one factor; very often resourceful
determination is more important.'
The determination of Forde and his partners has carried Michenuels through
its first year. Forde, who is no longer drawing state benefit, says he is
earning less than when he was last employed. 'But I am happy. It is still
early stages,' he says. 'The last three months have been good. If it keeps
up we can pay ourselves more.'

FT  26 JUL 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Missing link on training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Does training for owner-managers of small companies make their businesses
more successful at creating jobs or increasing profits? The answer is that
it might, but it might not.
According to research into the benefits of training, collated by Warwick
University's Professor David Storey*, there is no evidence to suggest that
more training leads to better business performance.
'The lack of a clearly demonstrable link between training and firm
performance is one of the reasons why many firms are reluctant to invest in
human resources,' say Newcastle University researchers.
The findings have startled the Confederation of British Industry. Until now
the CBI has tended to trot out Department of Trade and Industry figures that
training can reduce failures in businesses from a rate of one in three to
one in 10. Storey says he has failed to find the ultimate source of this DTI
claim.
Following Storey's research, the CBI has convened a working group to look at
the effectiveness of training. And it is circulating a questionnaire to its
members with the intention of developing a policy on management development
in smaller companies ahead of the CBI conference in November.
'There is a feeling that training is 'a good thing',' says Ian Peters, CBI
deputy director for smaller companies policy. 'There has never been an
attempt to measure training against specified objectives.'
The CBI agrees with Storey and other academics that the government has
tended to measure inputs - how many training courses are provided - rather
than whether the courses do any good. 'Particularly with the development of
Business Links there is a need to be more focused on the sorts of support
the government is providing,' says Peters.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Management (The Growing Business): The softly, softly
approach - Alternative funding for fledgling companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To borrow money for small business expansion you must prove that you already
have it.
This fact was discovered by Denise Lane Quality Garments, a bridal gown
manufacturer and industrial seamstress service in North Kesteven,
Lincolnshire, when it approached an investment trust company for a business
loan to expand to new premises. It was turned down because its turnover was
below Pounds 500,000.
'Unfortunately, we are looking at Pounds 130,000 annual turnover now but if
we get the second site we will increase to Pounds 500,000,' says co-owner
29-year-old Mark Faria. 'So we can't have the money to expand until we
expand and get the money.'
Faria and his partner, Denise Lane, have since been awarded a low-cost
Pounds 5,000 loan from a local scheme sponsored by the North Kesteven
District Council, the Lincoln Enterprise Agency, the South Lincolnshire
Enterprise Agency and Midland Bank. They are using this money to buy
industrial sewing machines but they still need Pounds 38,000 to complete
their expansion plans.
For many small businesses run by young owners and with turnovers under
Pounds 500,000, financing the growth of the business can be as difficult as
finding the money to start it. Banks and other corporate lenders are often
reluctant to issue commercial loans to small businesses run by young people,
even with viable proposals for future growth, because they are unable to
provide sufficient capital or have few assets to offer as security.
Youthful business owners are turning increasingly to alternative sources of
funding. A number of soft loan schemes like the one which aided DL Quality
Garments have sprung up around the country.
Many of these schemes - lending organisations which offer finance to small
businesses at either no interest or below market rate levels of interest -
also lend money on no security or with generous repayment holidays.
These lending organisations will look seriously at business plans rejected
by the banks. 'We look at businesses that do not have enough security or a
track record to interest a bank,' says John Petherbridge, director of the
London Business Growth Fund, a loan scheme of Greater London Enterprise, a
regional smaller-business development agency, for small companies that have
been trading at least one year.
The schemes do not want people to think they are just giving the money away
to anyone with a half-baked idea.
'We see ourselves as hard on the business and soft on the terms of the
loan,' says David Irwin, director of Project Northeast in Newcastle. 'We
would take the same view as to whether a business is likely to succeed as a
bank would.'
Sponsors of soft loan funds are drawn from the public and private sectors,
including the high-street banks. Many of the soft loan schemes now have
enough cachet to help young business borrowers obtain traditional commercial
finance in addition to soft loan funding.
The Prince's Youth Business Trust, for example, which gives expansion loans
of up to Pounds 5,000, has negotiated links with three high-street banks. It
is developing a commercial loan scheme for its entrepreneurs with Barclays,
Lloyds, Midland, National Westminster and TSB.
Midland has also agreed to make expansion capital available to
PYBT-sponsored proprietors through soft loan schemes which the bank
supports.
Many of the schemes provide training and advice to the business owners, and
the kind of one-to-one advice that counsellors at these organisations offer
is one of the reasons why banks have agreed to go into partnership with
enterprise agencies and local councils to sponsor soft loan schemes.
'If a loan is approved the local enterprise agency can provide on-going help
to the owner and reduce the chances of that business failing,' says Neil
Harle, manager of business sector marketing for Midland Bank, which
co-sponsors 30 soft loan schemes around the country.
Advice is perhaps most crucial when the company is pursuing finance. A
business plan has to be pitched correctly if a fledgling company is to
solicit a loan successfully. It must also have a financial perspective, one
that the banks will understand. Knowing the language of finance is one of
the keys to a successful funding proposal.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Technology: When anomalies become the norm - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND PETO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Let me set the scene. You are a senior executive in a business where your
success is largely due to good scientific research done in a textbook
manner. Ideas and projects are assessed by means of achievability, funding
is allocated either internally or by grants, and the whole is guided by the
opinions and boundaries dictated by experts and learned magazines.
So far so good. Now let me raise a question. Someone in your organisation
notices an anomaly. This, by definition, is 'an irregularity or departure
from the common rule'.
At this point, the usual thing is that the anomaly is ignored. An anomaly is
an embarrassment. It may mean the validity of the work so far is in
question. This person may check with magazines and databases and will find
no reference to his problem.
He may discuss it 'off the record' with his peers. It will affect present
and future funding and credibility if he follows it up. Quite often, an
anomaly questions tried and tested scientific laws that have worked well for
years. This researcher is daring to suggest that they are wrong or at least
need modifying.
The pressures on this person will probably stop him reporting his findings
to you. There is an automatic human reaction when exposed to an anomaly and
that is disbelief. This is healthy.
The next reaction is the belief that by not recognising the anomaly and not
researching it, it will cease to exist. This is fear and also faulty
thinking.
No one is to blame here. It is the system that has grown up over the years
to ensure that projects are worthwhile for funding, that the funding is well
spent on 'do-able' ideas and that professional journals and databases screen
out faulty information.
The solution is to make anomaly research a legitimate subject. The snag at
the moment is that the scientific community, though aware to some degree or
other of the problem, is powerless to do anything about it. (If scientists
talk about it, they risk their funding.)
This is where you, as chief executive, come in. You have nothing to lose and
much to gain by allowing anomalies to become a subject for discussion and by
positively promoting anomaly research within your business. It could then be
discussed and researched, funding would become available and information
could be published about it.
Worldwide, there are probably a few thousand researchers working on anomaly
research-related projects. They are mostly self-funded or funded by their
own businesses, but increasingly they are being funded by enlightened
companies, with the most significant funding coming from Japan and the US.
There are dozens of formal and informal societies set up to promote
knowledge between the research workers. The advent of person-to-person
networking via the telephone system allows global communication between
individuals.
This all bypasses the traditional research mechanisms that are not geared up
for anomaly research. The following example from my particular area of
research, energy generation by non-conventional techniques, illustrates what
I mean. This quote is from The Denver Report issued by Pace (the Planetary
Association for Clean Energy) about a recent symposium attended by 350
leading experts in new energy.
'There are now eight variations of experimental findings worldwide related
to cold fusion. Despite popular belief, this technology is not 'dead' and is
generally low profile in very competitive patent development stages . . .
replication and further research is being done in over 30 countries.'
This may be of no relevance to you, but whatever your area of interest, I
can assure you that there are anomalies and that people are working on them
somewhere.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Technology: Waiting for the big one - There is growing
scepticism about Japan's earthquake prediction programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DENNIS NORMILE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some 160km west of Tokyo in Japan's coastal Tokai region is what may be the
world's most dense array of geophysical instruments. More than 150 meters
and gauges track seismic activity, rock strain, crustal tilt, tidal
movements and ground water levels.
The data are telemetered to Tokyo where they are monitored around the clock
in the hope that six experts, to be summoned at a moment's notice, will
recognise unusual phenomena that may indicate an imminent earthquake. If the
committee so advises, Japan's prime minister will issue an earthquake
warning for the Tokai area.
Trains will be stopped, traffic routed out of the area, stores closed and
pupils let out of schools. Areas prone to landslides and tidal waves will be
evacuated. Hospitals, firefighters and rescue crews will go on alert. And
then everyone will wait for an earthquake measuring eight on the Richter
scale.
Long after the rest of the world has abandoned hope of predicting
earthquakes, Japan continues to spend Dollars 2.5m (Pounds 1.6m) a year
monitoring the Tokai region and close to Dollars 100m more on general
earthquake prediction research. For prediction believers, it is a small
price to pay, as Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone
countries.
But for increasingly vocal sceptics in Japan, it is at best a misguided
effort that wastes money and is dangerously misleading the public. Despite
the protests, however, Japan's earthquake prediction programme rolls along
on inertia, insularity and unrealistic public expectations.
Japan made earthquake prediction a national project in 1965 when scientists
throughout the world were optimistic about prediction. Research was also
being taken seriously in the US, Russia and China.
In Japan, prediction took on urgency when seismologists concluded that the
Tokai area was overdue for a significant quake.
The Suruga Trough, a deep submarine trench running just offshore, forms the
boundary between two of the earth's tectonic plates. The Philippine Sea
Plate is diving beneath the Eurasian Plate. Friction between these plates
causes the area's earthquakes.
The Tokai section last ruptured in 1854. If the entire section ruptures
again, the resulting quake could reach eight on the Richter scale,
endangering the lives of 10m residents in the area. That prospect led to the
1978 Large-Scale Earthquake Countermeasures Act, which established the
warning procedure and launched hazard mitigation and emergency response
programmes.
Since then, optimism about prediction has faded. Even prediction supporters
admit there is no scientific theory on which to base a forecast. Prediction
hinges on spotting anomalous phenomena, or precursors. Unfortunately, it has
proved impossible to conclude consistently and definitively whether the
signspredictors look for - swarms of small earthquakes, unusual bulges and
creeps in the earth's crust, sudden changes in geomagnetism or electrical
resistivity - are precursors or simply background geologic noise.
Precursors are often only recognised as such after a large earthquake. And
many earthquakes occur without any identifiable precursor, even in
retrospect.
There are also questions as to whether Japan's monitoring efforts are
focused in the right place. Recent studies by seismologists at the Ministry
of Construction have indicated the possibility of a significant quake
occurring in the Izu area between Tokai and Tokyo. The city is overdue for a
big quake, according to several theories. Japan has had numerous killer
quakes outside the Tokai monitoring network, including a 7.8 earthquake off
the coast of Hokkaido last year that claimed more than 200 lives.
Kiyoo Mogi, chairman of the six-member panel that will make the call on the
Tokai earthquake and former head of the University of Tokyo's Earthquake
Research Institute, says several factors make the Tokai region more suited
than others for what he calls 'a national experiment'.
The region's geology is straightforward, so they can narrow down the likely
location of the anticipated earthquake. Historically, strain along the
Suruga Trough has been released in infrequent large earthquakes, rather than
numerous small ones. The evidence is that significant strain has accumulated
along the fault since the region's last big earthquake.
Recognising precursors will still be difficult. Mogi says they now believe
that precursor patterns may be particular to each section of a fault. He
says if they knew what precursory phenomena occurred the last time that
section of the fault slipped, in 1854, they would be able to predict the
next earthquake. Instead, the six experts are watching for the rapid uplift
of the crust on the westward side of the trough that preceded quakes along
adjacent sections of the fault in 1944 and 1946. This all makes a successful
prediction a long shot.
Aside from the Tokai effort, scientists outside the programme are disturbed
that it is so generously funded and has so little to show.
Prediction research elsewhere withered as scientists who could not convince
review committees of the scientific merit of their research lost their
funding. Japan's prediction research activities, primarily overseen by the
Ministry of Education, Science and Culture, are subject to no such review.
A sub-committee of one of the ministry's innumerable advisory bodies draws
up five-year plans. But, in effect, the budget is divided among researchers
and institutions in the same proportions each year.
The public, and even public officials, remain largely unaware that Japan's
scientists are debating whether prediction is impossible or merely
difficult. Most citizens do not realise that Tokai is the only region in
which the government even intends to attempt a short-term warning.
High public expectations are coming back to haunt the six-member panel of
experts, which must conclude that the gathered data indicate either 'a cause
for concern' or 'no cause for concern'. Mogi would like to add a third
category between the two that would indicate 'some level of concern'.
Many scientists agree a 'maybe' is not unreasonable, given the state of the
art. Public officials, however, are insisting the experts make an 'it's
coming' or 'it's not' decision. Meanwhile, the controversy might be settled
if the experts get their call from the technicians monitoring the Tokai
data.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Technology: Promise of calls to come
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Life would seem much easier sometimes if we had a way of proving previously
made promises. Prices quoted on the telephone could be verified and hotel
reservations double-checked.
US and British telecoms companies are negotiating to purchase a new
technology which provides such a service. A New York social worker, JoAnn
Zucker, has obtained a patent for 'certified' telephone calls, faxes and
electronic mail and will grant licences to telephone groups in August.
The new technology is also being considered by the US federal court system
for approval as a legal document. The certified messages would have a number
of applications, says Alan Zucker, a former economics publisher who is
promoting the product.
US hospitals are interested in certified telephone calls to help them
document communications. If a patient is not able to make a medical
decision, for instance, the next of kin must be contacted. Currently, this
means a witness listening to the conversation between the physician and the
relative. Certified telephone calls would make the witness unnecessary. They
could also be used to verify over-the-telephone orders and requests. Courts
could serve a summons via fax.
The sender calls, faxes, or E-mails a telephone company providing the
service. If the sender does not want to talk to the recipient, the telephone
company records the message, then sends it on, taking note of when the
message was sent and received. The message can be programmed to be sent at
two-hour intervals, until it has been heard. In the case of E-mail or fax, a
photo of the message is preserved. If the sender wishes to talk to the
recipient, the message is recorded simultaneously with its delivery.
In 1993, 238m certified letters were handled by the US Postal Service, and
the Zuckers believe the new product could replace much of this business.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Van company acts on seatbelt safety concerns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LDV, the Birmingham-based van maker, is re-engineering all its minibuses to
provide three-point seatbelts and forward-facing seats as standard. All new
LDV minibuses which seat between 12 and 17 people will be supplied with the
new seats and belts from September.
The announcement follows concern over safety in minibuses, particularly
those used by schools, after a series of serious accidents.
LDV, formerly Leyland Daf Vans, said it aims to provide safety factors which
exceed legislation being considered.
Many older minibuses do not have belts fitted to passenger seats and as yet
there is no legal requirement for them.
The lack of seatbelts, combined with side-facing seats, was considered to
have been a significant factor in the deaths of 12 children and their
teacher on the M40 several months ago.
Mr Allan Amey, LDV chief executive, said yesterday: 'We all drive on
motorways and see 10-year-old converted vans being used as minibuses. That
is a concern. We can now offer our customers an improved level of safety.'
LDV said it expects to recoup the Pounds 1m cost of the programme, which has
taken nine months, through higher sales of its minibuses.
The market for 12 to 17-seater minibuses is typically between 3,500 and
4,000 units a year. LDV says it has about 50 per cent of that market, with
the rest of the market dominated by Ford.
LDV, like Ford, has been fitting lap belts only to all seats in its 12 to
17-seaters for several years. However, three-point belts require
modification of the vehicle's underbody, and Ford said last night that it
had no similar programme to LDV's.
Ford will announce today, however, that it is making available two-point
lap-belt kits for older minibuses, at subsidised prices to schools and
voluntary agencies. Ford said the kits would cost Pounds 350, including
value added tax and fitting, for 12-seaters and Pounds 400 for 17-seaters.
LDV also said yesterday that it would be creating 65 new temporary jobs at
its plant at Washwood Heath, Birmingham, to meet an increase in van
production from 250 to 300 a week.
The increase means that LDV will have increased its output rate by a half
and added more than 200 jobs since last spring. The plant now employs 1,180
people.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Rover hints at expanding production capacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rover Group said yesterday that it may need to review its carmaking capacity
next year if the company's upturn in worldwide sales is sustained this year
and then strengthened - as expected - by new models to be introduced early
next year.
Rover, which was bought early this year by BMW, the German carmaker, for
Pounds 800m plus debt assumptions, yesterday reported a rise of 16 per cent
in worldwide sales in the first half of this year. The increase, to 234,600
from 202,100 in the same period last year, took sales to their highest level
for four years.
Production rose even more sharply, to 251,900 from 206,500 - up 22 per cent
to a five-year high.
Within these totals the biggest increases were accounted for by the Land
Rover four-wheel-drive subsidiary. Its Discovery model has proved one of
Rover's biggest successes and it has just announced a Pounds 68m investment
to expand total Land Rover capacity.
First-half production of Rover cars was 19 per cent higher, at 208,300. The
group's rising car sales worldwide, particularly in export markets - many of
which are still in recession - indicate that Rover is steadily taking market
share from its rivals.
Total export sales in the six months rose 29 per cent to more than 106,000,
accounting for 45 per cent of Rover's total.
The indication that Rover may have to consider expanding capacity came from
Mr John Towers, Rover chief executive.
In recent years Rover has presented itself as having the goal of becoming a
profitable 'niche' producer of about 500,000 vehicles a year, each targeted
at the premium end of its market.
Mr Towers said yesterday he expected sales to continue to strengthen in the
second half of the year, lifting total sales to about the 500,000 mark.
However, he said Rover could be 'comfortable' with demand-driven expansion
to 650,000.
He added: 'It is possible that by the back end of 1995 we will be reviewing
how that situation can be accommodated.'
Mr Towers said that the gains made this year did not yet reflect any of the
product expansion and global marketing advantages Rover expected to gain
from the relationship with its new parent company.
While Mr Towers said that no significant new projects were at present under
discussion with Honda, its former partner, further collaboration with the
Japanese carmaker beyond present commitments should not be ruled out.
Although Rover this year is only returning to production levels reached five
years ago, the background against which it is producing vehicles is more
favourable than in the past.
Production then was declining, while Rover is now encountering production
constraints with its new 600 model. Early next year it will launch
successors to its biggest-selling 200 and 400 models, as well as new 'niche'
products such as a small MG sports car.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Minister welcomes building review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday welcomed proposals to reduce construction costs by
stemming contract abuses and improving services - but would not commit
itself to promoting new legislation.
Viscount Ullswater, appointed construction minister in last week's
reshuffle, said: 'The government is willing in principle to consider
legislation if the need for it is adequately demonstrated.'
It was the government's first opportunity to respond to an independent
review of the construction industry which called for a construction
contracts bill to improve payment and dispute procedures.
The review, sponsored by the industry and the government, said that it
should be mandatory to appoint independent adjudicators to resolve
conflicts, reducing the need for costly legislation.
A bill would permit trust funds to be established to hold contract cash to
protect companies should customers or contractors fail. Sub-contractors
would be able to charge punitive interest for late payments.
Viscount Ullswater said yesterday that the government welcomed the overall
thrust of the review. As a first step the Department of the Environment
would support the creation of an implementation forum, representing the
industry and its leading customers, 'to oversee the follow-up work necessary
to take forward the report'.
Sir Michael Latham, the former Conservative MP and ex-director of the
Housebuilders Federation who led the investigation into the industry, would
become chairman of the implementation forum.
Viscount Ullswater said this would advise whether a more permanent
administrative machinery was required to pursue the proposals and cut
construction costs by up to 30 per cent.

Investigators from the safety watchdog said yesterday they had found
'deficiencies' in the world's tallest rollercoaster after a crash that
injured 26 people.
The 235 ft ride at Blackpool, Lancashire - the 'Pepsi Max Big One' - was
officially opened a week before the accident earlier this month. It will
remain closed under a Health and Safety Executive prohibition notice issued
last Friday while investigations continue. The watchdog said the notice was
served on Blackpool Pleasure Beach, the operator, 'requiring it to address
deficiencies in the ride's braking and control systems'.
The accident happened when a train travelling at 35mph was not halted by a
computer-controlled brake and ploughed into the back of another.
Pleasure Beach said its staff would test the ride now that the watchdog had
returned it to the company's control.
'We are now allowed to start implementing their recommendations. We are
still no nearer a conclusion regarding the computer,' it said.
Arrow Dynamics, the US maker of the ride, is still examining the computer
systems that should have made it impossible for two trains to collide.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Army enlists first Challenger 2 tank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The army got a new tank yesterday. The first Challenger 2 was presented to
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, by Sir Colin Chandler, chief
executive of Vickers, at a ceremony at the company's Barnbow works in Leeds.
Vickers is building 386 Challenger 2 tanks for the British army in a Pounds
1.3bn deal which will ensure employment for 4,000 workers into the next
century. The government signed a Pounds 1.1bn contract for a further 259
tanks earlier this month to complete the order.
Adding to the ceremony were the pipes and drums of the Royal Scots Dragoon
Guards, which will be the first regiment equipped with the tank.
Mr Rifkind paid tribute to Vickers' designers and workforce. He said the
tank would enable the army to respond to the 'unpredictable challenges' of
the future.
Extensive trials have shown the new tank to be twice as potent a fighting
machine as its much-maligned predecessor, Challenger 1. As a result the
number of tanks in each of the eight armoured regiments is to be cut from 52
to 38 without affecting their overall fighting capability.
Senior officers originally made it plain they did not want another British
tank because of Challenger 1's poor reliability record. But the tank was
thought to redeem itself in the Gulf war.
Vickers also has an order for 14 tanks for the army of Oman.

FT  26 JUL 94 / High hurdles are the norm for investment: Gillian Tett on
the rates of return being used to assess new projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, presses on with his
campaign to persuade UK companies to lower target rates of return from
investments, a company such as Whitbread might give him cause to wince.
In spite of Mr George's warnings that high targets could stifle investment
and undermine the economic recovery, the company has little intention of
lowering its targets. Mr David Reed, director of corporate communications at
Whitbread, said: 'If anything our rates of return will rise this year.' The
most likely shift would be from a five-year pay-back to four years.
Comments such as these may not surprise the City, in light of the
Confederation of British Industry's survey earlier this week which showed
most companies keeping high investment hurdles - minimum targets for rates
of return - and inflation assumptions above government targets.
What may give economists more food for thought is that many companies reject
warnings that high hurdles might be hampering investment - not least because
inflation expectations matter less than uncertainty about demand.
Mr Reed pointed out that Whitbread's move to higher hurdles went hand in
hand with a new investment programme. He said: 'High hurdles are not a bar
to investment. We will raise our rate of capital investment by 50 per cent
this year.'
The example reflects a message about investment complexity that is being
echoed by most companies, as the Confederation of British Industry prepares
to publish its latest quarterly survey indicating manufacturing investment
intentions today.
Sir David Lees, chairman of the industrial group GKN, said it operated a
hurdle rate of about 20 per cent - a benchmark that had been maintained
through recent years, although it rose slightly in the late 1980s. He
insisted, however, that this varied from project to project, and said that
hurdle rates remained only one factor in his assessment of business
decisions.
He said: 'We have not formally changed our benchmark, although we would be
more easily persuaded in marginal cases by the somewhat better outlook for
inflation.' It was likely to take two more years of low inflation to
convince most businesses to change their inflation expectations.
Mr Derek Bonham, chief executive of the Anglo-American conglomerate Hanson,
is a little more upbeat. Mr Bonham said that last year Hanson lowered its
target rate of return 'in light of a changed inflation and interest-rate
environment. We use a mixture of methods but in the broadest sense you could
say we moved it from a four-year pay-back period to a a five-year one'.
Mr David Newlands, finance director of the defence and electronics group
GEC, has indicated that he expects little change to his company's hurdle
rates. However, he said: 'The rate of return that we look for depends on the
risk involved in the project. For some high-technology areas you would
expect a high rate of return - it's much more complex than surveys might
suggest.'

FT  26 JUL 94 / High-tech groups plan 49% staff growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A survey of more than 200 high-technology companies in England has found
that they expect staff numbers to grow by an average of 49 per cent in the
next five years.
The survey, by Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, covered organisations in
four regions - the north-west, Cambridge, the south coast and the west of
England - and sought to find reasons for their selection of location. In
spite of the predicted growth in their size, most companies expected to
remain in their existing region.
Companies listed the availability of a well-trained workforce and good
communications as the most important factors in influencing prosperity.
Quality of life, low staff costs and the proximity of an international
airport were regarded as the next most important points.
The research was carried out for the Western Development Partnership, a
regeneration agency, as part of a report published yesterday on
high-technology industry in Avon and its neighbouring counties of Wiltshire,
Gloucestershire and Somerset.
Survey respondents in these counties regarded the west as a poorer location
than the other areas. Companies elsewhere gave the region an even lower
rating.
The report says: 'This may be due to ignorance of the west of England, a
lack of a regional identity and uncertainty as to the precise area being
delineated - especially perhaps confusion with the more remote counties of
Devon and Cornwall.'
The report said the west had failed to build a strong position in high
technology 'although it had three strong universities, other centres of
excellence and a nucleus of high-tech businesses'.

FT  26 JUL 94 / PAYE may face radical overhaul
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pay-as-you-earn tax system could be subject to the first significant
restructuring since its creation 50 years ago, under radical plans being
considered by the Inland Revenue.
Taxpayers may face the prospect of speedier and more accurate calculation of
their liabilities but with the focus shifting to adjustments of any errors
at the end of each tax year, rather than during the year when their tax is
deducted from payroll.
The restructuring would follow sweeping changes being carried out to the two
other most important elements in the tax system: the shift to 'pay and file'
for companies, and to 'self-assessment' for self-employed taxpayers and
those with complex tax affairs.
These initiatives are designed to shorten the time between the receipt of
income and the payment of tax, and to place the onus for the first time on
individuals and companies to calculate for themselves how much tax they owe,
rather than relying on Revenue inspectors to do the work.
Senior Revenue officials are considering changes to PAYE as part of efforts
to fulfil the department's commitment to get tax assessments 'right first
time'.
The most radical reforms would involve simplification of the tax system,
which would require a commitment by ministers.
But officials believe they could also achieve considerable improvements
through internal management changes.
These changes would be likely to take place over a number of years, but
could include greater use of computer support, more accurate collection of
staff information from employers, and closer integration of tax and benefits
data.
They could also involve the concentration of efforts on accuracy in tax
coding either during or - more likely - at the end of the tax year, rather
than at both times.
One official said yesterday: 'A lot of people from 1944 would still
recognise the PAYE system in use today. We have a Rolls-Royce system and
there is something of an inconsistency in the way we use our resources.'
PAYE - or 'schedule E' - was introduced partly as an attempt to smooth the
payment of tax and ensure no large adjustments were required at the end of
the year.
With 23m people taxed under the system, it covers the vast majority of
taxpayers and last year netted nearly Pounds 51bn.
The Revenue said last night: 'We are always keeping PAYE under review and
looking at deregulation and efficiency. We cannot say anything more specific
at this stage.'

FT  26 JUL 94 / Paisley to urge devolved Ulster assembly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN, WILLIAM LEWIS and JOHN MCMANUS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionists, will today
urge Mr John Major to press ahead quickly with plans for a devolved Ulster
assembly as part of a drive to secure a durable political settlement in
Northern Ireland.
In a move likely to underline the delicacy of the task which the government
faces in forging a deal between Ulster's constitutional parties, Mr Paisley
will present the prime minister with a document setting out his party's
proposed solution to the conflict.
He will argue strongly that London should not offer Dublin anything in
return for removing its constitutional claim to Ulster.
News of Mr Paisley's plans emerged as Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein
president, insisted that the Irish peace process would continue, in spite
his party's refusal on Sunday to recommend an IRA ceasefire.
Mr Adams said: 'The peace process is not dead, it is very much alive. I
remain optimistic that we can move on. We need a process of demilitarisation
and I am optimistic we can move towards that.'
In London, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said the
IRA's political wing was isolated as never before.
He added: 'Sinn Fein and the IRA, for whom they speak, are now seen to be
continuing to use torture, murder, terror and indiscriminate violence for
political purposes in circumstances where both governments say that the
future of Ireland lies in democracy.'
In Dublin, the Irish government took pains to play down the appearances of a
split between Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, and Mr Dick Spring,
the foreign affairs minister, over how it should react to Sinn Fein's
response.
In his initial reaction on Sunday night Mr Reynolds said he saw positive
signals in Sinn Fein's response. Mr Spring was much less positive. He said
many people would be disappointed.
As Mr Mitchel McLaughlin, a senior Sinn Fein official, called in London for
the immediate reinstatement of dialogue between the British government and
the IRA's political wing, Irish government officials said channels of
communication between Dublin and Sinn Fein would remain open.
Today's six-page Democratic Unionist document is understood to draw on many
points from an earlier submission by the party, 'Breaking the Logjam'. This
called for the election of an assembly that would be given the task of
agreeing a form of government for Ulster in the UK. Only once agreement had
been reached and approved by voters in Ulster, and Dublin had removed its
territorial claim, would the assembly start negotiations on north-south
relations.
Mr Paisley is expected to resist any pressure from Downing Street to return
to the political talks process under Mr Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland
minister.

FT  26 JUL 94 / DTI urged to heed advice on Lloyd's solvency report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was urged in the House of Lords yesterday to ensure that the
Department of Trade and Industry takes account of independent advice before
it determines whether the Lloyd's market remains solvent, Ivor Owen writes.
Lord Marlesford, the Conservative backbencher who has described himself as a
'victim' of Lloyd's, suggested that the DTI should not rely entirely on its
own resources 'in view of the widespread suspicion and doubt that does
exist'.
Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, a government spokesman, said the DTI would look
carefully at the solvency report, which he believed was due out next month.
He said: 'We have no reason to believe that Lloyd's is insolvent. It
continues to pay all valid claims.'
Lord Peyton of Yeovil, the former Conservative minister, asked for an
indication of the government's thinking on decisions made by the US courts
which could have a 'catastrophic effect' on the insurance industry. Lord
Mackay said the problem of 'huge settlements' went a great deal wider than
Lloyd's. 'I think the insurance industry as a whole will have to look to the
courts of the US to perhaps be more realistic.'
He reaffirmed that the government had no plans to intervene in the market to
change the regulatory arrangements which were approved by parliament in 1982
with the passage of the private bill promoted by Lloyd's. Lord Mackay said
the management of Lloyd's had overhauled its self-regulating arrangements
under the legislation . 'The government considers this to be the best way
forward for the regulation of the Lloyd's market,' he said.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Ruling boosts compensation prospects for Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospects of Lloyd's Names winning further compensation for losses
suffered in the insurance market in the 1980s were yesterday enhanced after
the House of Lords ruled that claims could be brought under the law of tort.
Five law lords ruled that Names could bring actions under tort law, which
allows for damages claims not related to alleged breaches of contract.
The ruling clears the way for Names to bring more actions seeking
compensation, since under tort law claims can be made up to 12 years from
the date when the alleged damage was discovered. Claims for breach of
contract have to be started within six years of the action complained of.
Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, said it would
start proceedings against Littlejohn Frazer, the former Gooda Walker
auditors. The action to claim more than Pounds 100m compensation would
centre on the use of 'time and distance' policies by Gooda Walker's
syndicate 290, he said.
The House of Lords also upheld a Court of Appeal ruling that members' agents
were liable for the negligence of managing agents - a decision which
confirms the ability of Names to claim compensation from the 'error and
omission' insurance policies held by the members' agents. The E&amp;O cover
arranged by the members' agents totals about Pounds 1.1bn.
The Gooda Walker High Court case resumed yesterday with the start of closing
submissions. Mr Geoffrey Vos QC, for more than 3,000 Gooda Walker Names who
are suing the agency for more than Pounds 600m, said the agency's
underwriters had 'thrown away the rule book' and carried out their work in
an ad hoc, almost reckless manner.
During the hearing the judge, Mr Justice Phillips, said he had 'a lot of
sympathy' with the views on excess loss insurance expressed by Mr Ulrich von
Eicken, a former Munich Re executive who appeared as an expert witness for
the Names.
Mr Von Eicken had said that writing excess loss on excess loss business  - a
practice carried out by Gooda Walker - was an aberration since it could not
be properly rated.
Submissions will end this week. The judgment is expected in September.

FT  26 JUL 94 / BR aims for extra routes in strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Rail said yesterday it hoped to operate more routes during the
signalling strike that runs from noon today until noon on Thursday than it
has during previous strikes. The routes will include the commercially
important London Victoria to Gatwick Airport route as well as London
Liverpool Street to Cambridge and Shenfield in Essex.
A quarter of services are expected to operate - the same proportion as on
24-hour strike days during the past six weeks. But this week's action will
disrupt three days of services for the first time.
BR said: 'Some lines will be running virtually normally but others,
particularly in Scotland, will be closed for three days. On some routes that
are open, there will be no early-morning or late-evening service.' It added
that there would be a reduced weekday timetable in most areas this morning
and advised passengers to check that they could complete their journey as
many services would stop running after midday.
In Scotland a special timetable will operate in some areas but many routes
will be closed. Thameslink services will not run south of London today. All
day tomorrow and Thursday morning, special services will operate in many
areas but other routes will remain closed. On Thursday afternoon services
will restart in all areas except Scotland. All routes will be open by late
that afternoon except the Midland main line from London to Sheffield and
Thameslink to Brighton.
A number of London commuter services will be operating for the first time
since the dispute began seven weeks ago. These are Charing Cross to
Orpington and London Bridge to Hayes in south-east London. An hourly service
will run from London Liverpool Street to Norwich, first stop Ipswich.
Trains will be operating from Moorgate to St Albans and Bedford and from
King's Cross to Peterborough and Royston. Services will also run from
Waterloo to Woking, Epsom, Chessington, Basingstoke and Salisbury. A
substantial number of services will be operating in the Thames Valley from
Paddington. Trains will also be running from Paddington to Bristol,
Plymouth, Cardiff, Swansea and Cheltenham. There will also be trains from St
Pancras to Derby and Nottingham as well as from London Euston to Coventry
and Birmingham.
Services will be running from Manchester to Stockport as well as from
Inverness to the Wick and Kyle of Lochalsh. The Manchester to Edinburgh
route will be open as will Doncaster and York to Edinburgh.
Trains will be running from Preston to Glasgow, and a number of commuter
services will be operating from Manchester to Bolton, Preston, Lancaster,
Windermere and Llandudno.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Monopoly panel rapped as 'toothless'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Competition policy has become reactive, slow and unpredictable and does
little to deter companies from abusing their market position, the Consumers'
Association says today.
Mr Stephen Locke, the association's director of policy, says in an article
published today in Consumer Policy Review that competition policy is in
urgent need of review.
Mr Locke says the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which should be 'a
fearless guardian of the consumer interest, is gradually diminishing into a
toothless watchdog'.
He adds: 'From having one of the most effective and feared competition
regimes in the western world, the UK has slipped into the league of
also-rans, suspected by many of our international colleagues of being a soft
touch when it comes to abuses of market power and anti-competitive
agreements.'
The association calls for rules that are more clear, faster investigations,
more openness in decision-making and properly resourced watchdogs.
It also calls for compensation for consumers when companies over-price goods
or services or adopt restrictive practices. Customers who suffer loss should
be able to get damages, as in other countries.
There should be provision for class actions where consumer organisations
would be able to launch proceedings against companies abusing market power
on behalf of consumers generally.
The association says that recent reports by the monopolies commission on new
cars, perfume prices, ice cream, mortgage valuations and compact discs have
proved 'disastrous' for consumers.
Mr Locke says these reports have become 'progressively more corporatist in
tone and supportive of the status quo'.
The association says that competition law is too imprecise and therefore
unpredictable. Mr John Beishon, chief executive of the Consumers'
Association, has told association staff that he will consider withdrawing
recognition from two unions and sacking members who strike unless a pay
dispute is called off by August 1.

FT  26 JUL 94 / British Museum in Pounds 110m appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British Museum in London yesterday launched a Pounds 110m appeal to add
40 per cent more space for exhibits and improve access for its 7m visitors a
year.
Sir Norman Foster and Partners has been appointed as the consultant
architect for the project which should be completed by 2003, the museum's
250th anniversary. It is hoped that half the money will come from the
Millennium Commission, financed by the National Lottery. Sir Claus Moser,
chairman of the museum's development trust, is confident a matching sum can
be raised. The museum has already secured almost Pounds 10m.
The extra space will become available when the British Library moves out of
the museum to its site next to St Pancras station in north London. The Round
Reading Room, the heart of the library, was built in the 1840s in the centre
of the original great court of the museum. The architect plans to enclose
the inner courtyard with a roof, integrating it into the museum.
The reading room will be kept as a library open to the public but also to
scholars researching the museum's collection.
The new gallery space, which will cost about Pounds 55m to create, will
mainly be for the ethnographic collection, now housed at the Museum of
Mankind in Burlington Gardens, central London.
The museum's development trust faces two main problems. First, the new
British Library is still far from complete and there is no fixed date for
the transfer of books. Second, the Millennium Fund is designed to finance
new buildings and the museum will have to convince it that the proposals
amount to that.
The museum has already received Pounds 1m from the Korean government for a
new gallery of Korean art in an area previously used by the library.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Unions offer Blair a deal on party link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unions have offered a deal to Mr Tony Blair, the new Labour leader, which
would give him substantial freedom in policy-making in return for an
agreement not to challenge further their constitutional position in the
party.
Many union leaders were taken aback by Mr Blair's statement last Friday that
the unions would have no privileged place in the party.
One union official said: 'Privately we were disappointed that the union
issue was raised so quickly, but we decided not to react.'
Union leaders, symbolically pushed to the back of the hall at Mr Blair's
victory rally, know that they are not held in high esteem by the Blair camp,
which believes they run increasingly unrepresentative bodies.
But they have no strategy to challenge the Labour leader with motions on
specific levels for a minimum wage or targets for reducing unemployment at
this year's Trades Union Congress or Labour conferences.
They do, however, believe that they can prevent Mr Blair re-opening the
issue of their presence in the party after the defeat they suffered last
year over one member, one vote.
The settlement that the principal union power brokers are seeking is spelt
out by Mr Tom Burlison, deputy general secretary of the GMB general union,
in the latest issue of the New Statesman.
He writes: 'Blair needs to consolidate the party constitution, while being
radical in policy and presentation.
'If his programme of radical reform were to include the party constitution
it would be a disaster.
'Those in the party who are embarrassed by the link have learnt to live with
it, and the unions in turn have learned that their role in the party has to
be legitimate. To upset that settlement would be suicide.'
The Blair camp can probably accept a standstill on the formal union position
in the party, which still includes a majority of the votes at party
conference, a substantial presence on the national executive committee, and
one-third of the votes to elect the leader.
But union influence on policy is likely to diminish as think-tanks such as
the Institute of Public Policy Research become more influential.
One senior union official said: 'We are really being told by the Blair camp:
'If you've got something interesting to say, say it, but you no longer
represent the majority of workers so we will make up our minds about whether
to accept it or not'.'

FT  26 JUL 94 / MPs weigh cost of saving Swans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cost to the taxpayer of saving Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder
facing closure, would be less than letting the company go under, local MPs
said yesterday in a letter to the prime minister, the defence secretary and
the chief secretary to the Treasury.
Labour MPs Mr Steve Byers, who represents Wallsend, and Mr Nick Brown, whose
constituency is Newcastle East, say that the saving to the government from
providing the company with a two-year core programme of work - the main
demand made by the only potential bidder for Swans as a going concern -
would be Pounds 62.6m.
This comprises Pounds 15.6m in lost tax and increased benefits should Swans'
remaining 870 employees be made redundant; a Pounds 40m cost to the Treasury
in capital allowances and business rates relief if a Tyneside Enterprise
Zone were created; and a Pounds 7m European Community Intervention Fund
subsidy if an ocean survey vessel contract were offered to Swans and classed
as a merchant ship.
The MPs' letter is intended to back the arguments which Cherbourg
patrol-boat builder Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie will air today at
a meeting in London with Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, and Mr
Roger Freeman, defence procurement minister.
CMN, the sole prospective bidder, has said it would only buy Swans, which
has been in receivership since May last year, if the British government
guaranteed two years' work for the yard, worth about Pounds 50m, to underpin
its operations while export orders were sought for the yard.
The response of the ministers to Mr Iskandar Safa, head of CMN's Paris-based
parent company Soffia, should indicate the survival prospects for Swan
Hunter.
Yesterday Mr Fred Henderson, leader of CMN's bid team, said receivers Price
Waterhouse suggested in weekend discussions that it might accept deferred
payment for Swan Hunter should Mr Safa decide to proceed with the bid.
Mr Henderson declined to say what percentage might be deferred, or for how
long, but welcomed the proposal.
He added that the receivers were seeking about Pounds 10m for the company -
which is more than Mr Safa wished to pay.
But he believes that any gap between the two sides could be bridged.

FT  26 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Kobe Steel plans Chinese venture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Kobe Steel, the Japanese steel and construction equipment maker, has agreed
with Chengdu Engineering Machinery Group of China to set up a joint venture
company to manufacture and market construction machinery in China.
The agreement, to be signed today, marks the first joint venture involving a
Japanese company making construction machinery in China.
The joint venture, Kobelco Chengdu Machinery, will initially be capitalised
at Dollars 1m, with Kobe Steel and Chengdu Engineering Machinery each taking
a 45 per cent equity stake. Shinso Corporation, a trading company affiliated
with Kobe Steel, and Itochu, the Japanese trading company, will also own 5
per cent each.
Kobelco Chengdu Machinery will initially make, market and service 50 units
of hydraulic excavators and other types of Kobe Steel's construction
machinery.
Full-scale production is expected to begin after June 1996, when the
partners will consider expansion of production facilities and equipment to
make 1,000 units and target annual sales of Y10bn (Dollars 101m).
The joint venture is likely to be the only one in the construction machinery
sector in the rapidly growing southwestern and northwestern regions for some
time, as China's Ministry of Machinery Industry has no other plans to
authorise similar tie-ups, Kobe Steel said.
China is tightening rules on setting up foreign joint ventures with the aim
of protecting state assets, guaranteeing payment of capital and cracking
down on sham companies, Reuter reports from Beijing.
The China Securities newspaper said state companies seeking ventures with
foreign companies must report their assets to the state-owned Assets
Management Bureau. The new measures also aim to halt delays in paying up
joint venture capital.

Due to the introduction of the Single Market, EC countries are
currently changing to a new system of compiling trade statistics. All
trade figures are seasonally adjusted, except for the Italian series
and the German current account. Imports can be derived by subtracting
the visible trade balance from exports. Export and import data are
calculated on the FOB (free on board) basis, except for German and
Italian imports which use the CIF method (including carriage, insurance
and freight charges). German data up to and including June 1990, shown
in italics, refer to the former West Germany. The nominal effective
exchange rates are period averages of Bank of England trade-weighted
indices. Data supplied by Datastream and WEFA from national government
and central bank sources.

FT  26 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Imported beers boost market share in Japan
 -Heatwave increases sales - but foreigners are benefiting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Demand for beer in Japan has surged in recent weeks thanks to a prolonged
heatwave. However, officials at the country's leading beer companies are not
so sunny, as an increasing number of Japanese consumers are quenching their
thirst with imported beer rather than domestic brands.
Cheap imported beers are challenging the leading domestic manufacturers
which have long dominated the Japanese market. The yen's strength and bulk
purchasing power are helping big retail chains offer customers foreign beers
at half the price of the domestic brews.
Cutting out the middlemen through direct imports from manufacturers has also
allowed retailers to lower prices.
Foreign beer imports increased fivefold during the first four months of this
year, and some analysts expect sales of foreign beers, now 2 per cent of the
market, to rise to 4 per cent by the end of this year.
Even Daiei, the nation's largest supermarket operator, which triggered the
recent boom in imported beer by offering cheap Belgian beer, has been
surprised by the popularity. The retailer began selling 330ml cans at Y128
(Dollars 1.29) a can alongside domestic beer at Y220 late last year.
It initially expected to sell around 70,000 cases of imported beer this
year, but achieved that target in the first month. It now expects to sell 2m
cases, thanks to the heatwave, and sees import brands accounting for over
half its total beer sales this year. Other discount liquor stores and retail
chains have followed suit, and are also experiencing high demand.
The widespread discounting of beer comes four years after anti-trust
regulations concerning beer pricing were put into place.
In 1990, the Fair Trade Commission pushed leading beer companies to
advertise in mainstream dailies that retailers and wholesalers were allowed
to set their own prices.
Some beer company officials, however, regard the recent froth in import beer
sales as likely to subside. 'People are attracted to the prices but it
doesn't mean that they will continue to store their cupboards with cheap
imports,' said Asahi Breweries. Domestic brewers still regard the taste of
their own brands as superior to that of imports and so far, while prices of
foreign brands have been reduced, domestic beer prices have not been
discounted aggressively.
But analysts point out that this will change soon. 'It's a crack that will
lead to the dam's downfall,' says Mr Paul Heaton, retail analyst at brokers
Baring Securities in Tokyo. He expects the domestic beer companies will need
to start rationalising their complicated distribution system to reduce costs
and maintain their market share.

FT  26 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Taiwan to open building sector to foreign
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Taiwan will open its construction industry to foreign companies as part of
its efforts to further its application to join the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
In recent meetings, the US, Japan and other countries have made support for
Tai-wan's Gatt entry conditional on improved market access in government
procurement and big infrastructure contracts, among other measures.
The announcement on the contracting sector follows reports that US
negotiators were largely satisfied with Taiwan's plans to liberalise
services and government procurement as outlined during trade talks in
Washington last week. More talks on Taiwan's Gatt membership terms are
scheduled for next month.
Taipei representatives of foreign construction companies were cautiously
optimistic about the measures, which are to take effect by the end of this
year subject to cabinet approval.
'It's a good step forward,' said an official at a European company involved
in building Taipei's mass transit system. 'This means that foreign companies
will be able to establish themselves properly here. But we will be watching
closely to see whether the legislation is implemented in a transparent
manner.'
Under the draft, foreign construction companies with at least NTDollars 400m
(USDollars 15m) in capital and NTDollars 4bn in total revenues over the last
five years will qualify to set up an office in order to bid for big
projects.
The capital requirement for foreign companies is four times that for local
ones. 'Opening the industry to foreigners already will give local companies
a hard time. The aim is to slightly protect local companies,' said an
official with the construction and planning administration.
In 1990, Taiwan announced an ambitious long-range infrastructure development
plan with projected spending of USDollars 300bn. Last year the plan was
scaled back to USDollars 200bn, but most projects are well behind schedule
and many are likely to be quietly jettisoned.
Nonetheless, Taiwan has a substantial number of large-scale projects in the
pipeline and foreign companies are vying for contracts. Especially keen are
Japanese and Korean companies, which Taiwan has excluded from many
government contracts in an effort to curry diplomatic favour with European
and North American governments.

FT  26 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Kuwaiti deal for South Korea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN ALLEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBAI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Korea's Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction Company has won the civil
works contract to build a 2,400MW power station at Subiyah, in a remote area
near Bubiyan Island on the northern side of Kuwait Bay, for Kuwait's
Ministry of Communications, Electricity and Water.
Hyundai's bid of KD125m (Dollars 422m) was about Dollars 45m less than the
second lowest, submitted by the UK's Wimpey in a joint venture with the
Greek-headquartered but locally registered Consolidated Contractors (CCC).
Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is supplying and constructing the
turbines and boilers under a Dollars 1.3bn contract awarded last March.
Poland's Polymex is to supply the oil and water tanks.
Local Kuwaiti companies are to benefit from other subsidiary work, an
important factor in an economy where state contracts outside the petroleum
sector are scarce. CCC has a contract worth Dollars 100m to supply the fuel
lines from Doha power station to Subiyah, and Kuwait's Gulf Dredging Company
is to build the offshore water intake cooling system. Consultant at Subiyah
is the UK's Merz &amp; McLellan.
Subiyah is due to be completed in 2000, although the first two units,
providing 600MW, will come on stream in 1997. This additional generating
capacity will be more than sufficient to satisfy Kuwait's power needs over
the next four years. Total generating capacity is estimated to be almost
7,000MW, with water desalination capacity of more than 200m gallons a day,
compared with peak summer consumption levels of some 4,000MW and 160m
gallons a day.
Plans to build a power station - and indeed an entire city - at Subiyah
pre-date the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on August 2 1990. Since the end of the
war, the population of Kuwait has fallen by nearly 30 per cent, raising
questions about the need to develop areas in the north, especially at a time
of chronic budget deficits, cuts in government spending and plans to
introduce personal income taxes.
Diplomatic and industry sources suggest there are two reasons why the
government is willing to spend Dollars 2bn on Subiyah. Subiyah will be
linked with the rest of the national grid, so its additional capacity can
compensate for the demands that will come with building the proposed
petrochemical complex at Shuaiba, south of Kuwait city. This Dollars 2bn
plant is to be a joint venture between Kuwait's Petrochemical Industries
Company and the US's Union Carbide.
Also, the government's development of the northern part of Kuwait, including
Subiyah and neighbouring Bubiyan Island, would be a clear statement of
intent to Iraq that the Kuwaiti government is consolidating its presence in
the north by proceeding with its pre-war development plans. With the fourth
anniversary of Iraq's invasion a week away, such a statement from Kuwait is
symbolic, as Iraq has refused to recognise either Kuwait or the new United
Nations boundary between the two countries.

FT  26 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Brussels delay on export credits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Business Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission is to delay until autumn a decision on rules for
short-term export credits, in an attempt to meet British objections that its
draft regulations would unfairly jeopardise the UK system.
The Commission had been expected to publish the rules this month. However,
Mr Karel Van Miert, the European competition commissioner, agreed to the
delay after a meeting last week with Mr Richard Needham, Britain's trade
minister.
But though Mr Van Miert is to reconsider the commission's approach,
observers are unsure if it will be technically or politically possible to
find a compromise which satisfies all sides.
The proposed rules, which the Commission has the authority to impose, are
intended to prevent unfair competition by clamping down on government
subsidies.
The rules would apply to 'marketable' risks, defined by Brussels to include
all commercial risks within countries belonging to the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development except Turkey.
Britain objects that a proposed ban on state reinsurance of 'marketable'
risks could threaten its government's policy of financing, through the
Export Credit Guarantee Department, a small portion of the country's
short-term credit reinsurance exposure.
UK credit insurers, such as the Dutch-owned NCM group, say the policy brings
valuable stability by cushioning the risk of sudden shortages in reinsurance
capacity.
However, the UK complains that because the system does not distinguish
between commercial and political risks, the Brussels proposals would create
unnecessary confusion and could lead to complete withdrawal of government
support. Britain also denies that the government financing constitutes a
subsidy.
The UK is particularly incensed because, it says, it has already moved far
to meet the commission's overall objectives by privatising ECGD's short-term
export credits business three years ago.
Brussels has sought a compromise which would enable the UK arrangements to
continue temporarily. But Britain has rejected the offer, insisting the
proposed rules must recognise its system as permanent.
That demand, however, is opposed by France, Belgium and Spain. They argue
that anything less than a total ban on state reinsurance would leave open a
loophole for unfair subsidies.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Israeli warriors to fore at summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Veteran soldiers of wars against Jordan, relatives of the war dead, and the
few Israelis with any links to Jordan largely made up the delegation Mr
Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, brought to Washington for yesterday's
historic summit.
At a time of peace, the emphasis on battlefield losses may seem strange. Yet
it is a peculiar tradition of Mr Rabin's to emphasise throughout the Middle
East peace process the memory of Israel's sons who sacrificed their lives to
defend the existence of the Jewish state in the face of Arab aggression.
Mr Rabin, as chief of army staff, was responsible for the Israeli victory in
the 1967 Six Day War and the occupation of Arab lands. The warrior turned
peacemaker never completely shed his professional soldier personality, and
feels much more comfortable surrounded by military men.
Among the delegation are reserve Maj Gen Dani Matt, who was a commander in
the 1948 Arab-Israeli war and was taken prisoner by Jordan in the bloody
battles at Gush Etzion and paraded through the streets of Jericho on his way
to Amman; Dr Sharon Regev, the eldest son of Colonel Arik Regev who was
killed in 1968 during operations in the Jordan Valley against Palestinian
guerrillas infiltrating into Israel from Jordan; and Shimon Kahaner, one of
the paratroopers who fought successfully in 1967 to capture the old city of
Jerusalem from Jordan.
Mr Rabin also invited the few Israelis who were involved in early political
talks with Jordan including Mr Avraham Deskel, the 89-year-old director of a
power station. Mr Deskel knew King Abdallah, the grandfather of King Hussein
who was assassinated in Jerusalem in 1952 by extremists opposed to his peace
overtures towards Israel.
Mr Rabin's preference for soldiers and relatives is at the expense of
Israeli politicians. Mr Shimon Peres, the foreign minister who has done so
much to make the Middle East peace process a success, was only invited by Mr
Rabin to attend the summit at the last minute, reflecting a decades old
personality and power conflict between the two men.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Rwandan refugees struggle home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD and AP

<DATELINE>
   GISENYI, RWANDA, KIGALI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tens of thousands of Hutu refugees, in a thin ribbon stretching along the
160km from Gisenyi, in Rwanda, to Kigali, the capital, have returned home to
throw themselves on the mercy of the country's new Tutsi-led government.
The refugees, who fled Rwanda in panic, are returning rather than face death
from cholera and starvation in Zaire's refugee camps.
The exodus began after Zairean troops reopened the border crossing between
Goma, in Zaire, and Gisenyi on Sunday.
The returnees are barefoot, carrying their meagre belongings on their heads.
After surviving the horror of Goma, many are too weak to make the return
journey and several have died only a few kilometres outside Gisenyi.
There are no relief agencies to help them along the way and little food. The
Hutu exodus out of Rwanda swept the mountainous north-west of Rwanda like a
plague of locusts. Banana groves have been stripped of fruit. The bean
harvest has rotted. Hills have been denuded as swathes of trees were chopped
down for firewood.
US military officials arrived in Kigali this week to begin the planning of
their humanitarian relief operation.
Ms Alison Campbell, a spokeswoman for the relief agency Care said, said: 'If
the refugees understand they are receiving aid from Kigali, and news spreads
that the Rwandan Patriotic Front is co-operating with the international
relief effort, this could have an important psychological impact in helping
build trust between the refugees and the new government.'
Relief workers in Goma, however, said the return of refugees had not begun
to dent the magnitude of the humanitarian catastrophe in Zaire. Cholera is
killing refugees in their thousands. The 28 trucks assigned to collecting
the dead have been overwhelmed by the corpses that pile up.
Mr Peter Hansen, a special envoy of the United Nations secretary-general, Mr
Boutros Boutros Ghali, yesterday told reporters that the UN's emergency
funds were exhausted and that it had no money to continue the relief
operation. He said the UN would launch a new appeal for Dollars 440m (Pounds
283.8m) to deal with the crisis, but he was not optimistic about receiving
the funds swiftly enough.
'The situation is out of control,' he said. But relief agencies are not yet
advising refugees to return to Rwanda. A formal repatriation programme would
require the agreement of the governments of Rwanda and Zaire and the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees.
Rwanda plans to prosecute tens of thousands of people for genocide and
murder in trials that could begin within a month, AP adds from Kigali.
Prime Minister Faustin Twagiramungu said that, within the bureaucracy of the
former government alone, there were more than 22,000 people suspected of
complicity. UN officials estimate between 200,000 and 500,000 people were
murdered in three months.

</HEADLINE>

   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia has agreed to sell seven cryogenic rocket engines to India, in spite
of US objections, an Indian government minister said yesterday.
Mr Raghunandan Lal, minister of state for external affairs, told parliament
in New Delhi that the rocket engines would not be accompanied by a transfer
of technical data.
Mr Lal's assurances contrast with the claims by Indian scientists last year
that drawings and other technical specifications had been acquired from
Russia.
The US had protested that the deal, worth about Dollars 250m (Pounds 160m),
violated the Missile Technology Control Regime, which seeks to halt the
spread of rocket technology, particularly to the developing world. Russia,
initially adamant that it would go ahead, then suspended the deal.
Mr Lal said the deal stipulated the delivery of four rocket engines now and
three later. Cryogenic rockets are powered by low-temperature fuels such as
liquid hydrogen and oxygen.
India, a key non-communist ally of the former Soviet Union, is widely
believed to be a nuclear threshold power, currently engaged in the
production of its own nuclear delivery system.

<TEXT>
TNT, the large Australian transport group, and Ansett Transport Industries,
a related company, have withdrawn their defence against a case of alleged
price-fixing brought by the Australian Trade Practices Commission, deciding
that it would be preferable to face a substantial penalty rather than
continue the legal fight.
The TPC is Australia's main competition watchdog, and the case, which was
filed in 1992, centred on an alleged cartel in the express freight business
during the 1980s.
The case had been brought against TNT, Ansett Transport Industries, Mayne
Nickless, another big Australian transport company, plus a number of
individuals, under section 45 (2) of the TPC Act. This prohibits
market-sharing agreements between companies or curbs on the supply of goods
to decrease competition.
Yesterday, Mayne declined to comment on TNT's decision, or to say whether
would follow its fellow defendants' example.
In a statement, TNT and Ansett Transport Industries said the move to
withdraw a defence had been taken 'for purely commercial reasons'.
The case had not been expected to reach a hearing until next year, and this
would have lasted several months.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese vehicle production in the first six months of this year was down
10.8 per cent, a record first-half fall and the first time the industry has
seen a fourth consecutive fall, according to the Japan Automobile
Manufacturers' Association.
Vehicle production between January and June totalled 5.2m units compared
with 5.9m units in the same period last year. The previous record fall was
9.4 per cent in 1974, JAMA said. In June alone, vehicle production fell 3.2
per cent to 956,662 units.
The fall came in spite of a more moderate fall in domestic demand of 3 per
cent to 3.8m units. JAMA attributed the decline to falling exports caused by
the yen's rapid appreciation and to a growing trend towards overseas
production. JAMA estimates that exports in the period fell 20 per cent.
Mitsubishi Motors said yesterday it would start manufacturing an upgraded
version of its popular Galant car in the US next spring in an attempt to
avoid the worst effects of the high yen.
Although Mitsubishi plans to export engines for the car from Japan, the
company has already agreed to buy transmissions for the car from Chrysler,
the US carmaker, to reduce costs.
Honda is to invest Dollars 310m (Pounds 200m) to boost its north American
operations. Honda said it would increase car and engine manufacturing
capacity and strengthen R&amp;D and sales in north America, and increase exports
from there.
Such moves have been a significant factor behind falling domestic production
levels, JAMA said.
Car production fell 11.9 per cent in the first half and 5.4 per cent in
June, the 15th consecutive monthly fall. Production of trucks fell 7.5 per
cent and that of buses fell 12.4 per cent.

Asia-Pacific nations celebrated the end of the cold war yesterday by
launching the Asean Regional Forum (ARF), a multilateral security group that
includes China, Russia, the US and 15 other members.
Foreign ministers put forward numerous proposals for improving security,
including measures to prevent weapons proliferation, and the establishment
of a regional peacekeeping centre. ARF members are expected to decide which
ideas to implement at their next ministerial meeting in Brunei in 1995.
For alphabetical reasons Vietnam, represented by Mr Nguyen Manh Cam, the
foreign minister, and the US, in the form of Mr Strobe Talbott, deputy
secretary of state, found themselves in adjacent armchairs at the meeting in
a Bangkok hotel.
Several participants remarked on how the end of the cold war had put a stop
to old confrontations but created new uncertainties. 'Many interlocutors
said that five or 10 years ago it wouldn't have been possible to have these
ministers discuss things - and it was in a harmonious way,' said a Canadian
official. 'This was a historic first meeting and got off to a good start,'
said another.
Territorial claims in the South China Sea, the North Korean nuclear crisis
and the problems of Burma and Cambodia were among the issues raised.
Mr Qian Qichen, Chian's foreign minister, sought to allay Asian fears of
Chinese expansionism by reiterating that 'China does not engage in
aggression or expansion, or seek hegemony'.
Mr Roberto Romulo, foreign minister of the Philippines - which, like China
and four other countries, lays claim to islands in the South China Sea -
suggested that the various military garrisons on the atolls of the Spratly
archipelago should communicate through a common radio frequency and play
volleyball with each other to reduce tensions.

FT  26 JUL 94 / China sees 50% jump in reserves
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
China's foreign exchange reserves at the end of June had jumped by 50 per
cent over last year to Dollars 31.8bn (Pounds 20.5bn) because of increased
exports and the effects of a currency devaluation.
Mr Zhu Xiaohua, a deputy governor of the People's Bank, China's central
bank, said the increased reserves indicated a 'sound performance of the
national economy'.
Western bankers in Beijing attributed the healthier reserves to the
government's tight money policies which had restrained imports in the first
half of the year.
The depreciation of the yuan against the Japanese yen and the D-Mark had
boosted exports to two of China's bigger markets. The Chinese currency,
which is not convertible internationally, tracks the US dollar.
China's export performance improved markedly in the first four months of the
year following a deficit last year of Dollars 12.2bn. Export growth
rebounded by 22 per cent to April compared with a sluggish 8 per cent in
1993.
Import growth slowed to 20 per cent in the January-April period compared
with growth last year of 30 per cent. Economists are forecasting a smaller
trade deficit this year.
The unification of China's multi-tiered currency at the beginning of the
year and the establishment of an interbank money market had also bolstered
the country's reserves.
But western experts warned that China's foreign exchange reserves remain a
murky issue. Beijing is now providing what it says are figures for reserves
held solely by the central bank.
Previously it had combined the reserves of both the People's Bank and Bank
of China, China's specialised foreign currency bank.
China's debt service ratio (interest payments as a percentage of exports and
net private transfers) was expected to be in the range of 8-10 per cent this
year, according to a Morgan Guaranty survey.
Some Dollars 11.7bn and HKDollars 5.4bn (Pounds 454m) was traded in
Shanghai's new foreign exchange market between April 1 and the end of June,
the official China Daily newspaper reported yesterday.
The establishment of the Shanghai market was part of far reaching reforms of
China's foreign exchange system aimed at achieving full convertibility for
the Chinese yuan within about 5 years.
Chinese officials will not be drawn on the timing of such a step, but make
no secret of the fact that turning the yuan into a 'hard currency' is one of
their priorities.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Politicians catching up with Japan's military: Post-cold war
adjustment has preceded its new legal right
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vice admiral Kazuya Natsukawa, commandant of Sasebo naval district, covering
the vital sea lanes off southern Japan, has just been given the legal right
to do his job.
It was granted by his commander-in-chief, the new socialist prime minister
Tomiichi Murayama, who last week clarified nearly 50 years of muddled debate
on Japan's pacifist constitution by declaring that his party had dropped its
belief that Japan had no right to maintain armed forces.
Mr Murayama's about-turn, supported by just more than 60 per cent of his
party members, makes little practical difference to the role of vice admiral
Natsukawa's ships. The vice admiral confesses in any case to polite
scepticism over the prime minister's pronouncement.
Nor does it affect the big changes among Japan's pragmatic defence planners,
as they start to adjust, irrespective of Japan's political turmoils, to the
regional instability that has followed the end of the cold war.
That much was clear when vice admiral Natsukawa led his ships on manoeuvres
off the southern port of Kagoshima recently, honing their ability to respond
to whatever threat an unstable north-east Asia might throw at them. He
admitted, with a frankness that might startle his political masters, that
his forces are technically ready to support a US naval blockade of North
Korea, should there be call for one.
'We would rather call it a sea intervention than a blockade,' he adds, in a
nod to political delicacy.
For the first time, a national self defence agency white paper published
this year singles out North Korea - 'a serious destabilising factor' -
rather than Russia as the main threat to regional security.
What this means for the practical organisation of Japan's military should
become clearer early next month when a government panel, appointed by former
prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa in February, is due to publish the first
overhaul of defence policy for 18 years.
One message, according to an early draft of the report, is that Japan must
be less reliant on the US - which keeps 24,000 troops on the archipelago -
for its protection, because the end of the cold war has reduced Japan's
strategic value to Washington's security. That implies more spending on
defence electronics, such as anti-missile systems and the possible
acquisition of Japan's first spy satellite, say officials.
The panel will also encourage the government to follow other world powers in
cutting the overall defence budget. Pacifist Japan has become in recent
years the world's second-largest defence spender after the US, with a
defence budget this year of Y4,679bn (Pounds 30.6bn). This is, however,
purely a reflection of the yen's strength and the self defence force's high
wage and pensions bill.
The forces actually in use are in line with Japan's low military profile,
even if hard to reconcile with the strict wording of the constitution's
pacifist article 9, that 'war potential will never be maintained'. Less than
a quarter of Japan's defence budget goes on equipment, about 80 per cent of
which is made by Japanese companies, often under licence from the US.
At just less than 1 per cent of gross domestic product, conveniently below
the mark considered a political flashpoint, Japan devotes less of its wealth
to defence than do Germany or Italy. The total tonnage of its 160 navy ships
makes the Japanese navy smaller than that of Britain or France. Its 150,000
troops, already well below the authorised ceiling of 180,000, makes the
Japanese army slightly larger than Britain's.
The government has already started to trim military spending and both the
dominant Liberal Democratic party and its Social Democratic party allies are
keen to continue this process. This year's defence budget marks a 0.8 per
cent nominal rise over 1993, the smallest increase in 34 years, and a fall
of about 1 per cent in real terms.
Despite Mr Murayama's conversion to reality, a more self-reliant defence
force could pose political problems among constitutional die-hards.
'Devoting thought to building an appropriate defence capability, much less
putting it to actual use, has been a public taboo and a high political risk
domestically,' explains a recent paper by Major Atsumasa Yamamoto, a member
of the defence agency's intelligence division.
Defence agency planners interpret article 9 to mean a ban on the purchase of
instruments of overt aggression such as aircraft carriers and ballistic
missiles. This is much harder to interpret in battle. The dividing line
between what vice admiral Natsukawa and his colleagues may or may not do to
defend their ships is almost impossible to define. They may shoot at
incoming missiles; but do they have to ask parliament's permission to shoot
at the ships, aircraft or launchers that fired them?
Article 9 has also been taken, by a 1960s cabinet resolution, to rule out
participation in 'collective security' arrangements beyond its own
frontiers. This is supposed to limit the ground forces to defending the
Japanese islands in case of invasion, and to restrict the navy to policing
sea lanes up to 1,000 nautical miles from Japan.
The rule against collective defence could complicate any attempt to take
part in one of America's theatre missile defence programmes, ideally suited
to counter the North Korean threat, as suggested in the panel's draft
report. But the 1,000-mile rule does mean North Korean waters are legally in
the navy's reach - especially now that the self defence forces themselves
are constitutional.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Rare moment of sun for Christopher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Warren Christopher has not enjoyed many unquestioned hours in the sun
since he became secretary of state in the Clinton administration 18 months
ago.
But yesterday's Israeli-Jordanian summit in Washington offered him such a
moment, for there is no foreign policy issue to which he has devoted such
unremitting attention as the various Middle East peace processes.
He has conducted three shuttle missions to the region already this year and
plans a fourth in the second week of next month. He has Israel and Syria
engaged in indirect peace negotiations. Even when apparently, if
temporarily, bypassed - it was the secret Norwegian channel which got Israel
and the Palestine Liberation Organisation talking - he and Mr Dennis Ross,
his able Middle East assistant, have always been around to nudge the process
further.
Middle East policies have long carried great weight for US secretaries of
state, perhaps exceeded only by relations with the former Soviet Union. It
was Mr James Baker in the Bush administration, who brought governments from
the region together in Madrid in 1991 after the Gulf War. The Camp David
accords rank high in the achievements of President Jimmy Carter and Cyrus
Vance. Henry Kissinger's shuttle diplomacy in the 1970s involved
negotiations as arduous and complex as Mr Christopher's.
Pilloried though he has frequently been on any number of foreign policy
issues, and with even his tenure the subject of endless speculation, nobody
has ever questioned Mr Christopher's dogged determination and patience,
qualities that seem to pay particular dividends in the frequently
incremental progress made in the Middle East.
Other volatile crises of the moment - Haiti, Bosnia, Somalia, Rwanda, even
relations with Russia - have often evolved at such speed that Mr Christopher
has not always given the impression of being on top of them.
The constant demand of his critics that he enunciate an over-arching vision
of US foreign policy also does not exactly play to his strengths. The recent
shift of Mr David Gergen, the spinmeister extraordinaire, from the White
House to the State Department reflected recognition of this deficiency.
In a collegial - and sometimes reactive - administration like President
Clinton's, Mr Christopher and a State Department in which personnel changes
at the upper levels have been constant, have not necessarily emerged as the
dominant players in many of these exigencies. The ball on Haiti, for
example, has been carried more by the National Security Council, the
Pentagon and the Central Intelligence Agency than by the secretary of state.
But the Middle East has always been different, for both strategic and
personal reasons. In the long Iranian hostage crisis of 1979-81, it was Mr
Christopher, then deputy secretary of state, who spent long weeks
negotiating in Algeria and elsewhere.
His familiarity with both the players and shifting policies of the region
has never been doubted. But, leaving nothing to chance, it was he who
persuaded Mr Ross last year to stay on in the new administration to provide
continuity.
Mr Clinton gave him his due yesterday on the White House lawns, saying that
nobody had done more than Mr Christopher to bring King Hussein and Mr
Yitzhak Rabin together. The secretary of state, his eyes discreetly hidden
by dark classes, allowed a small smile to lighten up his well-lined face.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Zaire bank governor defies suspension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KINSHASA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Zaire's central bank governor Ndiang Kaboul ignored his suspension and
turned up for work as usual yesterday in defiance of prime minister Kengo Wa
Dondo, Reuter reports from Kinshasa.
Colleagues applauded Mr Ndiang, who was suspended on Friday pending an audit
of recent bank transactions, as he arrived at his office in the Bank of
Zaire.
But a board meeting to discuss the crisis at the bank was chaired by the man
appointed as his temporary replacement, deputy governor Matomina Kiala, bank
officials said.
Mr Kengo's government has accused Mr Ndiang, in the job since February, of
flooding Zaire's black market with millions of newly printed zaire notes,
sending the national currency into a disastrous downward spiral and
triggering hyper-inflation.
They say the governor, appointed by President Mobutu Sese Seko, ordered
notes to be printed for friends, influential politicians and army generals.
In an interview with an opposition newspaper, Mr Ndiang angrily denied the
charges. He challenged the legality of his suspension and said he had asked
President Mobutu to rule in the matter.
'A governor of the central bank, appointed by presidential command, who
enjoys a certain autonomy and prestige thanks to the importance of the
institution, cannot be suspended or fired any old way,' he told the
newspaper Le Potentiel.
'I am ready to show all the accounts and outgoings for the bank from the
start of my mandate until the present day. I demand that justice be done,'
he added.
He said he was launching legal proceedings against finance minister Pay Pay
Wa Syakassighe, who compiled a damning report on the Bank of Zaire's
activities, for abuse of position, denigration of character and drawing up a
false report.
The currency, the zaire, a reliable barometer of public sentiment, firmed to
1,050 to the US dollar from 1,400 before the governor's suspension.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Bombing death toll in Argentina reaches 96
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rescue workers in Buenos Aires yesterday pulled 27 more bodies from the
wreckage of Argentina's main Jewish centre and said there were 11 more still
in the rubble, bringing the confirmed toll from last week's bombing to 96,
Reuter reports.
Jewish groups, which have collected lists of those missing after the blast,
say the final death toll may be around 100.
General Meir Livne, who heads an Israeli army rescue team, confirmed
theories of a car bomb driven by a suicide driver. 'The crater in the road
and the sidewalk, and the engine we found inside the building point to a car
bomb,' he said. 'We think it may have been activated by the driver.'
The blast was the second such attack against Jews in Buenos Aires in two
years, 30 people having been killed by a car bomb at the Israeli embassy in
1992.
Mr Uzi Baram, Israeli tourism minister, was to meet Argentine President
Carlos Menem yesterday to ask the government to do its utmost to catch the
bombers.
Mr Peter Tarnoff, US State Department under-secretary, also arrived in
Argentina for talks with Mr Menem, the US embassy said.

FT  26 JUL 94 / US heading for radio auction bonanza
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEREMY KAHN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US government began auctioning off new radio bands yesterday, in an
unprecedented move which could raise billions of dollars for the Treasury.
The Federal Communications Commission, which has previously given away its
licences through lotteries or hearings, was last year given congressional
approval to auction exclusive rights to a range of new frequencies which can
be used for the next generation in paging, telephone and voice and data
communication systems.
The Congressional Budget Office predicted the government could raise Dollars
10bn (Pounds 6.6bn) through the auction.
The process began yesterday as 29 bidders competed for a group of 10
nationwide licences for 'narrow band' frequencies. These can be used for
advanced paging systems, two-way pagers, and wireless modems and faxes.
At the end of the first hour of bidding yesterday morning, two contenders
alone had offered bids totalling more than Dollars 104m, aimed at winning
all the frequencies. Bidders are identified only by a numerical code until
all rounds are concluded.
Because FCC rules allow a company to purchase only three of the 10 bands, it
is likely that the two companies will have to withdraw bids for some of the
frequencies, which might lower the amount the government receives.
However, FCC officials said that the first round looked promising. 'This
totally exceeded the most rosy projections,' said Congressman Edward Markey,
who was instrumental in the FCC securing permission to hold the auction,
announcing the first round results.
The bids ranged from Dollars 6.25m to Dollars 20m, depending on the
frequency and its capabalities.
The bidding for the first 10 bands is expected to continue until Thursday,
but may end earlier if a few companies continue to out-bid their competitors
by large amounts and drive out the smaller businesses.
The FCC will then begin to auction off regional narrow-band service licences
and licences for inter-active video and data services. By the end of the
year, the FCC expects to have sold off 3,500 narrow-band permits, 1,400
inter-active licences and 2,000 permits for the next generation of mobile
telephone services, collectively known as 'broad-band' services.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Business treads warily across Quebec divide: Concern that a
likely separatist campaign after poll may be bad for economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The head of a Canadian think-tank offered a word of advice at a recent
dinner party to the new public relations chief of a Toronto mining company:
Make sure, he said, that your chairman keeps his mouth shut on Quebec.
The election in the francophone province, called by Premier Daniel Johnson
for September 12, will have a profound impact on Canada's business climate.
The question of what role business leaders should play in the campaign and
in the period after the poll has become a pressing issue in executive
suites.
The separatist Parti Quebecois is now well ahead of the ruling Liberals in
opinion polls. The PQ has promised if it wins it will hold a sovereignty
referendum within a year.
Polls show that a clear majority of Quebecois do not favour independence.
Their support for the PQ appears to be based mainly on the desire for a
change in government after nine years of Liberal rule.
Nevertheless, a PQ government can be expected to step up the pressure to
wrest more powers from the federal government in Ottawa and to create as
many trappings of sovereignty as possible. Mr Jacques Parizeau, the PQ
leader, responded to the election call by pledging to end Quebec's
participation in efforts to overhaul Canada's social security system and
other federal initiatives which require the provinces' co-operation.
The PQ's interventionist economic platform, which has so far received little
attention on the hustings, has also raised concerns in business circles. Mr
Parizeau has said that he plans to make fiscal discipline a lower priority
than economic growth. Measures to contain the budget deficit are expected to
centre on higher taxes rather than spending restraint.
Uncertainty over Quebec's future has already had an unmistakable economic
cost. Interest rates have risen more sharply in Canada than the US this
year. Investor nervousness is especially evident in the provincial bond
market. Medium-term Quebec bonds offer a yield 92 basis points (92/100ths of
1 per cent) higher than equivalent government of Canada bonds. The spread on
bonds issued by neighbouring Ontario is only 45 points.
Business leaders worry that a PQ victory could cloud the investment climate
for years to come as the independence debate rages on.
Mr Laurent Beaudoin, chairman of Bombardier, the Montreal-based transport
equipment maker, told his company's annual meeting last month that the PQ's
agenda 'will bring with it high risks of skidding, of numerous setbacks
(and) of confrontation within Quebec, and between Quebec and its partners'.
Fears of political and economic paralysis in the run-up to an independence
referendum are likely to feature prominently in the Liberals' campaign over
the next seven weeks.
Mr Beaudoin added that 'those of us who believe that by choosing
(sovereignty) Quebeckers are taking the wrong direction should now express
their opinion publicly.'
Few have heeded his call so far. Indeed, corporate chiefs in Toronto and
other parts of English-speaking Canada think that following Mr Beaudoin's
advice may do their cause more harm than good.
Mr Tom D'Aquino, president of the Business Council on National Issues, which
represents the chief executives of Canada's 150 biggest companies, says that
'outside involvement in the debate on the election issues would not be
terribly productive, and could be counter-productive'. While BCNI members
'are doing our homework, we're doing it quietly'.
Separatists have in the past skilfully turned warnings about the cost of
independence to their advantage by accusing big business of blackmailing and
frightening Quebecois.
The most celebrated example took place in 1992 at the height of a referendum
campaign on the Charlottetown Accord, a package of constitutional changes
that were designed to mend fences between Quebec and the other nine
provinces. Royal Bank of Canada, the country's biggest financial
institution, was vilified in Quebec for releasing a study which concluded
that 'political disunity' could slash Canada's gross domestic product by 18
per cent within eight years and shrink incomes by an average of CDollars
4,000 (Pounds 1,869) a person.
Mr Beaudoin's outspokenness is even the exception in the clubby world of
Quebec business and politics, where pressure in the francophone community to
stand together against outsiders is strong.
Tactics are likely to change however, if and when a PQ government sets a
referendum campaign in motion. 'The home-town team now, the national team
later,' says Mr D'Aquino. The risk is that once a separatist government is
installed in Quebec City, the momentum towards a breakaway will become more
difficult to stop.

FT  26 JUL 94 / House poised to probe Whitewater
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Congress today is to have its first formal crack at the Whitewater
affair, with Mr Lloyd Cutler, the White House legal counsel, leading a
parade of administration officials testifying to the House of
Representatives banking committee.
The remit of the congressional hearings - the counterpart committe in the
Senate is due to begin its work later this week - is limited but could
embarrass the administration and might further damage some prominent
careers. The sessions will be televised.
By agreement with Mr Robert Fiske, the special counsel on Whitewater, the
committees are to confine themselves to the 'Washington end' of the complex
tale of land and financial dealings of President Bill Clinton and his wife
in Arkansas in the late-1970s and the 1980s.
In a preliminary report last month, Mr Fiske cleared White House and
Treasury officials of any criminal wrongdoing. But witnesses will be
questioned on their knowledge of contacts between the Clinton White House
and regulatory agencies with responsibility for investigating the Whitewater
affair.
In a weekend TV interview, Mr Cutler said there had been 'some regrettable
errors of judgment' by some officials and that contacts should have been
limited to White House and Treasury legal counsels. But, he said, his own
internal review had found 'no violation of any ethical legal standard.'
Most under the gun appears to be Mr Roger Altman, deputy Treasury secretary
and former acting head of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency set
up to clear up the savings and loan debacle of the 1980s.
Madison Guaranty, a now defunct Arkansas savings and loan body, is at the
heart of the Whitewater affair. Mr Altman is suspected of concealing to
Congress, in testimony last February, his full knowledge of contacts with
the White House about criminal investigations of Madison.
Yesterday, the New York Times reported that the diaries of Mr Joshua
Steiner, chief of staff to Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, had
included notes that Mr Clinton himself was irate when Mr Altman decided to
excuse himself from the Madison probe in February. Mr Clinton has denied any
such intervention.
Mr Bentsen also faces questions about his knowledge of inter-agency
contacts. Ms Jean Hanson, Treasury legal counsel, is reported to have told
Senate investigators that she had attended a meeting on February, with Mr
Bentsen and Mr Altman, about Madison, which preceded a briefing by Ms Hanson
and Mr Altman of White House officials.
The Treasury secretary issued a statement on March 3 to say he was never
informed of any such meetings. Over the weekend, Mr Altman's lawyer said his
client had 'no recollection' of the meeting described by Ms Hanson.
The conduct of the House committee hearings will depend in good measure on
the chairmanship of Mr Henry Gonzalez, a venerable Democrat from Texas. He
was long opposed to any such hearings and has been portrayed by Republicans
as a staunch defender of the president.
But his record for rooting out presumed malfeasance is long and impressive.
His investigations of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International and of
the Keating five - payments by a former savings and loan official to
senators - head the list.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Rafael Caldera of Venezuela raised the stakes in his battle with
Congress at the weekend, saying that the losing side in a proposed
referendum - the administration or the Congress - should resign.
The confrontation erupted last Friday when a joint session of Congress voted
to restore five out of six constitutional rights which Mr Caldera had
suspended 24 days earlier.
Later on Friday, the executive said that it had suspended the same rights
again. These grant protection against arbitrary arrest and police entry into
private homes, the right to free movement in and outside national territory,
the right to own property, and protection against expropriation without due
process and indemnity.
The administration asserted that conditions were not yet right for the
restoration of these liberties, ordinarily suspended only during civil or
military upheaval.
In announcing the renewed suspension, Mr Caldera said he would be willing to
call a national referendum on the suspension. After an opposition politician
had said the government should resign if a majority rejected the president's
line, Mr Caldera asserted that Congress should resign if the referendum
supported him.
This has annoyed Congress, which is controlled by three political parties
(Democratic Action, Copei and Radical Cause) in opposition to Mr Caldera.
One Democratic Action member warned that his party might call for a vote of
censure against several members of the president's cabinet.
With the constitutional rights suspended, the adminstration has raided food
stores in search of 'profiteers' and 'hoarders', confiscated property
alleged to be linked to bank fraud, seized merchandise over illegal price
increases, and rounded up hundreds of suspected law-breakers in the cities.

The United Nations should consider pulling out of former Yugoslavia, whether
or not the current peace proposals are accepted, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali,
UN secretary-general, said yesterday .
In a letter to the Security Council, he said the United Nations forces were
not strong enough either to enforce a peace settlement, or to withstand the
consequences of an escalating war.
He suggested that if the international community acted on its threat to
punish the Serbs for intransigence - through air strikes or by supplying
arms to their enemies - the UN would become a target for Serb retaliation.
'Such (punitive) actions would deliberately impinge on the basic military
interest of one of the parties and would therefore be likely to be
militarily resisted,' Mr Boutros Ghali warned.
In Bosnia, Serb forces seemed already to be embarking on a war of nerves
with the UN. Yesterday, they challenged the UN to call in air strikes by
firing heavy weapons near the 'safe haven' of Gorazde for a second day.
The UN also blamed the Serbs for the anti-aircraft fire at Sarajevo airport
last week which has forced the suspension of relief flights. The Serbs have
denied responsibility.
In a third challenge to the UN, the Serbs refused to allow the evacuation of
35 sick people from Gorazde unless all Serb prisoners held by the Moslem-led
Bosnian government were released.
Negotiators from the five-nation contact group which has devised a partition
arrangement for Bosnia conferred in Moscow yesterday over how to react to
the Serbs' ambiguous reply to the proposal.
A statement by the group said they discussed 'additional measures aimed at
removing the objections from all sides in the conflict'.
The group's members - the US, Russia, Britain, France and Germany - were
united in pressing for acceptance of the peace deal but seemed split over
how to cope with its apparent failure. No firm decisions are expected until
the group's foreign ministers meet in Geneva at the weekend.
Mr Igor Ivanov, Russian first deputy foreign minister who chaired the
meeting, said before it began that they would continue to strive for
acceptance of the latest peace plan - accepted by the Croat-Moslem alliance
but in effect rejected by Bosnian Serb leaders.
'We believe we have a plan that is balanced and realistic and reflects the
interests of all sides,' Mr Ivanov said. 'It would hardly be expedient to
abandon it.'
General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, will arrive in former
Yugoslavia today, where he is expected to meet Serbia's President Slobodan
Milosevic and possibly the Bosnian Serbs as well.
Gen Grachev has often been in direct communication with General Ratko
Mladic, head of the Bosnian Serb army, and the Russian minister may be one
of the few people who can exercise any influence over the Serb commander.
Yesterday, Russia announced a wide-ranging defence co-operation agreement
with Greece calling for joint exercises, possible co-production of weapons
and the exchange of information on defence matters. Greece is the only
European Union member which shares Russia's traditional sympathy for the
Serbs.

Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgian prime minister, yesterday announced a
relatively palatable budget for next year, which included no significant tax
increases nor large cuts in public spending. Higher than expected growth
this year, plus revenue from privatisations, meant that Mr Dehaene was able
to present a package that he said would not take the budget deficit above
4.3 per cent of GDP, the target for next year. Last year the budget deficit
was 7.2 per cent of GDP and this year it should fall to 5.7 per cent. The
long-term aim is to reduce the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP to meet the
Maastricht treaty's criteria for monetary union by the end of 1996. The
government considers that measures taken in its austerity Global Plan last
November were sufficient to keep the budget deficit under control. These
reined in spending on social security and froze wages in real terms for
three years. The plan prompted considerable social unrest. Next year's
fairly soft budget, however, seems to have been framed with October's local
elections in mind. The budget was drawn up on the basis of estimated GDP
growth of 1.7 per cent this year rising to 2.6 per cent in 1995.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Treuhand's final debt to total DM270bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's Treuhand privatisation agency will have accumulated debts of
DM270bn (Pounds 110.6bn) when it ceases operations at the end of this year.
Then, its financial requirements will be met directly by the federal budget,
Mr Heinrich Hornef, the agency's financial officer, said yesterday. The
debt, DM5bn lower than recently forecast, will be financed from next year by
bank loans and government guaranteed medium-term notes. Mr Hornef said it
will take 'another generation to pay off' the deficit.
Total receipts from privatisation sales since June 1990 would exceed
DM53.2bn. It was believed originally that the sale of some 13,000 eastern
German enterprises through the agency would raise more than DM600bn but
these early estimates were rapidly hammered by the cost of German
unification and collapsing eastern European markets.
The Treuhand was provided with DM7bn start-up capital in June 1990 and this
was supplemented by DM10bn the following year. Once the ruinous state of
east German industry became clear, the ceiling for new borrowing in 1990 and
1991 was raised to DM25bn. In 1992, the agency was granted a credit line of
DM38bn annually. These have all been consumed.
Until now, the deficit has been financed through three different channels:
bank credits, bonds, and medium-term notes. The agency has already issued
DM160bn in long-term debt, and expects to do the same with an additional
DM50bn. The remaining DM60bn of the total deficit will be broken down, with
DM23bn financed through debt rescheduling, DM25bn through the capital
markets, and the remainder carried over to the federal budget next year.
Since the Treuhand will no longer exist after this year, its total debts,
along with all other debts of the former east Germany, will be assumed by
the Unwelcome Legacy Repayment Fund set up after German unification in 1990.
The agency's financial requirements for 1995 onwards will total DM45bn. The
government has made provisions in the federal budget for annual expenditure
of about DM6bn. Treuhand contributions to next year's budget are expected to
total DM5.4bn, rising to DM6.5bn in 1996.
Nevertheless, the Treuhand has still to privatise some key elements of the
east German economy, which may increase its debt and financial requirements.
These include:
Laubag, the region's largest brown coal field. A consortium led by
Rheinbraun, a subsidiary of RWE, Germany's largest utility, is expected to
make a down-payment of DM2.1bn for Laubag, and a further commitment of DM6bn
over the next 20 years. However, it is still unclear how much the Treuhand
will have to pay in redundancy payments for restoration of brown coal fields
to be closed.
Veag, eastern Germany's largest electricity utility, which will be sold to a
consortium led by RWE, and including PreussenElektra and Bayernwerk. The
consortium is expected to pay DM8bn for Veag and invest DM40bn over the next
two decades.
The sale of Buna, the chemical works in Saxony-Anhalt, and the modernisation
and privatisation of Leuna, the other chemical and oil refinery complex.
Eko Stahl, the loss-making steel mill in Brandenburg which the agency had
hoped to sell to Riva, the Italian privately-owned steel manufacturer. until
Riva pulled out in May.
According to a recent Bundesbank report, the main part of the Treuhand
financial legacy will impose a 'pro rata burden of DM17bn per annum on the
federal budget, which will arise from the Unwelcome Legacy Repayment Fund'.
It added that 'the envisaged debt itself will only be redeemable in the
course of a generation.'

Dutch retail sales fell 1.5 per cent in real terms in May, the first decline
since January. However, the central statistical office blamed the downturn
on one fewer Saturday in the month than May 1993. If corrected for that
difference, the retail sales index actually rose by 1.7 per cent. The
statistical office also reported yesterday that the Netherlands' trade
surplus widened to Fl 1.7bn (Pounds 630m) in March from Fl 1.5bn in February
and Fl 1.2bn in March 1993. The increased surplus extends the higher trend
seen both in 1993 as a whole and in the first two months of 1994.
Italian industrial producer prices rose 3.2 per cent in the year to May,
compared with a 3 per cent rise in April, the national statistical institute
reported. Wholesale prices rose by 3.5 per cent year-on-year to May 1994.
Germany's balance of payments surplus on the capital account widened in May
to DM8bn (Pounds 3.3bn) from DM2.3bn in April and DM6.5bn in May 1993,
according to data published by the Bundesbank yesterday.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Kok coalition would cut social spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE HAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Dutch caretaker finance minister, Mr Wim Kok, yesterday put forward a
government coalition plan that emphasises 'stiff' cuts in social spending
and a determined focus on creating jobs.
The proposals, which Mr Kok described as painful but necessary, are designed
to break a political deadlock that has prevented the formation of a new
government since general elections in May.
The government impasse is partly the result of the inconclusive election,
but the search for a coalition has also been complicated by sharp
differences over social security reform between Labour and the right-wing
Liberals.
Mr Kok called on the country's four main political parties to respond to his
proposals by midnight tonight. He then hopes to be able to advise Queen
Beatrix within a week on which parties should launch detailed negotiations
on forming a government.
He declined to say which coalition he thought most likely. 'This is not a
betting shop,' he said at a news conference. 'I'm not going to make
predictions.'
However, Mr Kok is likely to be the next prime minister provided his own
Labour party approves his programme and agrees to take part in the
coalition.
His 59-page document, written at the request of the queen, is the second
serious effort to form a government. A previous attempt to put together a
coalition between Labour, the Liberals and the left-of-centre D66 party
failed in late June after a disagreement on the specifics of social spending
policy.
Mr Kok's new proposals call for nearly Fl 18bn (Pounds 6.6bn) in total
spending cuts, about the same volume as agreed loosely by Labour, Liberals
and D66. However, his suggestions on social spending reductions are
detailed, meeting an objection raised earlier by the Liberals. His proposals
cover many types of 'cradle to grave' expenditure that are bound to be
controversial.
Child benefit would fall in real terms, student grants would be lowered,
early retirement for government officials would be curtailed, and funds for
widows and orphans would be reserved for those in genuine need.
Nevertheless, Mr Kok has remained loyal to his Labour roots by shying away
from cutting the amount of money paid to social welfare recipients or
shortening their period of eligibility for payments.
He also proposed cuts in taxes and social security premiums totalling around
Fl 9bn. The goal of the next government should be to get as many people back
to work as possible, he said. According to his calculations, some 350,000
jobs could be created over the next four years, more than compensating for
the expected entry of 300,000 people on to the labour market in the same
period.
The country's budget deficit would remain stable at around 3.3 per cent of
gross domestic product next year but would fall to at least 2.9 per cent by
1998.
It is not yet clear whether the outgoing Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers'
Christian Democrats will become part of a new government. If not, this will
mark the first time that the party has been relegated to the opposition
benches in modern Dutch politics. Mr Lubbers had said at the beginning of
his current term that he would not seek re-election.

FT  26 JUL 94 / France's magistrates embark on the corruption trail with
Italian gusto: A rash of publicised probes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
France's magistrates do not have a picture of President Mitterrand on the
wall - they have one of Antonio Di Pietro.
This remark by a prominent Paris lawyer reflects the view of some observers
that the country's magistrates are being influenced by the example of the
high-profile anti-corruption crusade of Milan's magistrates under the
leadership of the popular Mr Di Pietro.
Indeed, France's recent rash of highly publicised corruption investigations
has raised the question of whether the country is becoming a second Italy,
not necessarily in the level of corruption but in the vigour with which
French magistrates are matching their Italian counterparts in cracking down
on white-collar crime.
In pursuing cases that involve some of the largest companies in the land and
causing earlier this week that most unusual event in France, a ministerial
resignation, many French magistrates are influenced by what is happening in
Italy, say critics.
In the process, legal safeguards are being swept aside, complains Mr Pierre
Suard, chairman of the Alcatel Alsthom engineering group. After being freed
on FFr1m (Pounds 120,000) bail, after 12 hours of questioning on allegations
of misuse of corporate funds and underpaying Alcatel suppliers for work done
to his residence, Mr Suard said: 'I don't know whether there is a campaign
against big companies, but it seems French legal practices are being
violated. In France, investigations should remain secret. If it (the
investigation concerning himself) had been, then there would not have been
damage to the company and shareholders.'
Some go as far as to argue that a new generation of magistrates has at last
escaped government control and have decided to take their revenge on an
establishment that has long undervalued their work. And others ask who it is
that is to blame for the widespread leaking of judicial and police
information that is piercing the cloak of secrecy with which French
investigations are supposed to be shrouded?
At the heart of the controversy are France's 550 juges d'instruction. These
investigating magistrates are called in to investigate all felony charges
(rape, murder) and any case that is complex (corruption, white-collar
crime). They are generally young and not well paid.
According to Mr Valery Turcey, secretary general of the the largest union
among France's 6,000 magistrates, an investigating magistrate starts in his
or her mid-to-late 20s on an ordinary secretary's salary of FFr13,000 a
month, rising to FFr20,000 after 10 years. A few come to the job late with
useful experience but it is not rewarded in pay terms.
They have statutory independence as juges d'instruction, and the judiciary's
general independence has been reinforced in the past year by a reform of the
Conseil Superieur de la Magistrature which dilutes the power of the
executive in determining appointments. Investigating magistrates still know
that, to attain the highest reaches of the judiciary, they will have to
spend some subsequent stint in the government prosecution service. But many
care less what the government thinks of them, if only, as Mr Turcey says,
'there is now a generation of juges d'instruction who feel their career
advancement is blocked by a sizeable number of older magistrates'.
But Mr Turcey insists that investigating magistrates can use their
considerable powers to order police searches, interrogate witnesses, detain
defendants, only if and when 'instructed' by state prosecutors and within
limits laid down by prosecutors. Mr Pierre Mehaignerie, the justice
minister, has for instance been criticised in the press for leaving police
to continue their inquiries into improper party funding allegations
concerning Compagnie Generale des Eaux, rather than calling in an
investigating magistrate.
But the main complaint of people caught up in recent cases is the way, as Mr
Gilles August of the Paris law firm of Sales Vincent Georges puts it,
France's 'inquisitorial system is being exploited by the media'. Secrecy has
been of the essence to this 'inquisitorial' system that places the quest for
truth over the rights of the individual, compared with the Anglo-Saxon
'adversarial' system which gives a higher priority to the rights of a
defendant in a confrontation with the prosecution that is left to juries to
decide.
Thus, French police and magistrates can question a suspect for 20 hours
before the latter has the right to have his lawyer present. Only after a
suspect has been formally charged, or 'put under examination' in French
legal jargon, can his lawyer have access to the magistrate's dossier.
This sometimes leads people to demand to be 'put under examination' so that
they or their lawyer can see the evidence an investigating magistrate has
compiled against them. Mr Alain Carignon said he resigned as communications
minister in the Balladur government on July 17, precisely in order to
contest charges, filed yesterday, concerning allegations that Lyonnaise des
Eaux, the other big French water company, bankrolled a newspaper that
campaigned for his re-election as mayor of Grenoble in return for getting
the city's water contract.
Mr Turcey says 'it is defendants who started the business of 'media-tising'
cases'. Mr Maurice Arreckx, a senator from the Var region in the south, is
for instance not yet a defendant, but has a judge on his heels who wants to
make him one by bringing charges for corruption. Last Thursday Mr Arreckx
used an interview in Le Figaro to proclaim his innocence.
In general, Mr Turcey says investigating magistrates are far too busy, each
dealing with an average 120 ongoing dossiers at any one time, to want to
bring down a lot of time-consuming publicity on their heads by leaking
material to the press. But he concedes that investigating magistrates, and
the occasional prosecutor such as Mr Eric de Montgolfier, who has held press
conferences during his investigation into possible football bribery by Mr
Bernard Tapie, sometimes use the press to forestall attempts by their
superiors to smother their inquiries.
Mr Jean-Pierre, he says, 'would never have got anywhere in his
investigations into Socialist party funding if he had not used journalists'.
The justice ministry and the Senate are now beginning to consider how to
accommodate inexorable media pressure in high-profile cases with the need
for some legal secrecy. One solution, suggests Mr Turcey, would be to try to
preserve absolute secrecy up to the point at which a suspect is formally
charged, and to abandon it thereafter.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Former minister faces inquiry over alleged misuse of funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alain Carignon, former communications minister, was yesterday formally
placed under investigation for complicity in the misuse of corporate funds,
a week after he resigned his portfolio to contest the charges, writes David
Buchan.
The allegations against Mr Carignon, an RPR Gaullist mayor of Grenoble,
concern a possible link between his decision in 1989 to privatise the city's
water services and give them to Lyonnaise des Eaux to run, and the latter's
subsequent move to take over and wipe out the FFr5.4m (Pounds 650,000) debt
of a moribund newspaper that had supported his re-election campaign. Mr
Carignon denies any connection.
He is one of the very few ministers in recent French political history to
stand down in the face of legal problems. He said it would be 'unfair for
the prime minister (Balladur), whose actions are beginning to bear fruit, to
suffer from the media hype' of his case.
In the recent rash of corruption investigations, Mr Carignon was the only
ministerial target, though Mr Francois Leotard underwent a similar
investigation before becoming defence minister and Mr Gerard Longuet, the
trade and industry minister, is still the subject of preliminary inquiries
regarding a commission given to a member of his party.
The prime minister is nominally keeping his job open for him, if he can
clear his name, by giving the post temporarily to Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, the
budget minister. But Mr Carignon seems unlikely to return to a government in
which he had a series of territorial disputes with Mr Jacques Toubon, the
culture minister.
Mr Carignon was yesterday freed by the Lyons investigating magistrate
without bail or condition. Senator Maurice Arreckx, from the Riviera
department of the Var, may not escape so lightly. The government prosecutor
in Aix-en-Provence is asking the Senate to allow him to detain Mr Arreckx
while he investigates corruption charges against him.

A Milan public prosecutor asked a court yesterday to sentence Italy's former
prime minister Bettino Craxi to 11 years in jail for fraudulent bankruptcy
in the collapse of Banco Ambrosiano, the Italian bank, court sources said.
The prosecutor asked for 10 years' jail for Mr Claudio Martelli, former
justice minister and once Mr Craxi's deputy in the Socialist party, and
seven years each for Mr Leonardo Di Donna, former vice-president of state
energy group Eni, and Mr Licio Gelli, former grandmaster of the banned P2
Masonic lodge. Mr Craxi and Mr Martelli are accused of having accepted
several million dollars from Banco Ambrosiano before it collapsed in 1982.
Mr Craxi, who has been at his holiday home in Tunisia for months, faces
numerous investigations in connection with alleged corruption. Yesterday, a
Rome judge ordered him to stand trial for graft over contracts to build the
city's metro system. Charges were dropped in the same case against Fiat
managing director Cesare Romiti and finance director Francesco Mattioli.

<TEXT>
The Athens appeals court council has called for confidentiality rules to be
lifted on bank accounts held by Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the former Greek
prime minister, as part of an investigation launched earlier this year into
accusations that he took bribes while in office. Mr Mitsotakis is accused of
accepting a Dollars 22.5m (Pounds 14.5m) bribe in the 1992 sale of Heracles
General Cement, the state-owned Greek cement producer, to Cal-Nat, a joint
venture between Calcestruzzi, the construction arm of Italy's Ferruzzi
group, and National Bank of Greece. The Dr124bn (Pounds 337m) deal was the
biggest privatisation carried out by Mr Mitsotakis' conservative government.
Once the investigation is complete, the Socialist-controlled parliament will
vote on whether to lift his immunity against prosecution. Mr Mitsotakis, now
a backbencher, also faces charges of illegally tapping the telephones of
political rivals while in office, in a case being pursued by deputies from
the governing Panhellenic Socialist Movement.

FT  26 JUL 94 / French nuclear waste claim

<TEXT>
Cogema, the French nuclear fuels agency, yesterday rejected allegations by
Greenpeace, the environmental organisation, that its proposal of more
generous terms on nuclear fuel recycling and waste to a German customer,
PreussenElektra (PE), had broken French law. Revealing a May 1994 letter
from Cogema to PE, which belongs to Veba of Germany, Greenpeace said Cogema
was offering to 'keep not only (PE's) plutonium but also the majority of the
waste, in France', in defiance of France's 1991 law banning the long-term
storage of foreign nuclear waste in the country. A Cogema director denied
that any such offer to PE had been made, saying that 'we try to recycle what
we can and to treat the rest as best as possible'. He added that 'Greenpeace
has its opinion, we have ours and the customers will decide'.

<TEXT>
The first summit meeting between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and
Estonian President Lennart Meri will take place today in Moscow. Top of the
agenda will be the promised departure of Russian troops from the former
Soviet republic by the agreed date of August 31. Russian diplomats yesterday
talked down expectations of a breakthrough on another contentious issue, the
residence and pension rights for 10,000 former Soviet military and security
officers. But one told the news agency Interfax that the meeting 'may give
an impetus to resolving many controversial issues'. These include the
dismantling of the nuclear submarine training base at Paldiski and Estonia's
claim to two strips of territory recognised as Estonian by the 1920 Tartu
treaty with Russia and now under Russian control.

   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund,
is scheduled to make his first visit to Ukraine tomorrow to discuss
financial aid in a signal that the new Kiev government is committed to
painful economic reforms. Mr Camdessus' trip echoes his role in Russia,
where he negotiated a loans agreement in spring which bolstered Moscow in
pursuit of economic reforms. Meanwhile, Ukraine's repeat parliamentary
polls, held on Sunday, left 92 seats unfilled and elected only 20 new MPs of
centrist and moderate orientations, according to preliminary results from
the Central Election Commission. Low turnout disqualified 47 districts,
which will conduct further repeat elections later this year. In another 45,
no candidate won enough votes and the top two contenders will hold run-offs
on August 7. Observers predicted that even this small infusion of moderates
would help to minimise the domination of Communists and leftist allies in
the 450-seat parliament, because factions are so small. There are nine
factions in Ukraine's parliament and three-quarters of MPs were elected last
March and April.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Rail passengers face 48-hour stoppage from noon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's railway network faces widespread disruption from noon today with
the start of the first 48-hour stoppage in the seven-week-old signalling
dispute.
But last night Dr Brian Mawhinney, the new transport secretary, said he did
not understand why the conflict could not be settled. 'All the elements
exist to enable a settlement to be reached,' he claimed after a meeting with
Mr Bob Horton, chairman of Railtrack, which owns and maintains the railway
network. 'The dispute can and must be resolved,' added Dr Mawhinney. He said
that the current offer to the RMT transport union 'makes it hard to see why
a resolution of this dispute should continue to be so elusive'.
Yesterday, it was estimated by Mr Maurice Fitzpatrick, of the accountants
Chantrey Vellacott, that the strike would cost the British economy around
Pounds 330m this month or around two-thirds of 1 per cent of July's total
gross domestic product.
If the strike escalated to eight days a month into September it would reduce
the full year GDP by about 0.2 per cent, he said.
Railtrack said last night that about 30 per cent of the network would be
covered by signalling operations over the strike period.
It is estimated that a quarter of services will operate, including, for the
first time, from London Victoria to Gatwick airport and from London
Liverpool Street to Cambridge and Norwich.
The two sides in the dispute were involved in a bitter exchange yesterday on
whether the signalling services provided by supervisors and management
during this week's strike would threaten railway safety. Mr Jimmy Knapp, the
RMT transport union's general secretary, said Railtrack could not maintain
any service during the strike 'without compromising safety'.
He added: 'Railtrack's safety guidelines this week are lower than they were
last week and considerably diluted from when this dispute started.' The RMT
said staff were being deemed competent to operate signal-boxes without any
'previous hands-on experience'.
But Mr Horton said the company would do nothing to endanger passengers and
added he would rather run fewer trains than undermine safety.
The union still insists on an 'up-front' payment for past productivity
before negotiating a restructuring package for signalling staff. It argues
that Railtrack is offering only a 4 per cent improvement in earnings which
is less than the 5.7 per cent offer discussed in early June and vetoed by
the government.
Railtrack says the signalling staff are being offered a 2.5 per cent basic
pay rise; a 6 per cent unconsolidated supplement worth 3.2 per cent on
earnings for immediate changes in working practices and a Pounds 250 one-off
payment. Mr Horton also told Dr Mawhinney the package would produce
additions to pensions, sick pay and holidays.

FT  26 JUL 94 / German exchange investigates insider trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES and MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The German stock exchange has launched an insider trading probe in the wake
of criminal investigations into suspected tax evasion by a group of
Frankfurt stockbrokers.
The exchange inquiry was ordered yesterday following weekend press reports
that a ring of about two dozen German brokers had allegedly conspired in a
highly profitable 'front-running' operation through a Geneva-based
investment firm.
Front-running is stock market jargon for traders who profit by using prior
knowledge of large 'buy' orders from clients to purchase shares on their own
account and sell them later as prices rise.
The exchange investigation, which will examine whether a voluntary code of
practice has been breached, is separate from the criminal investigation into
tax evasion, which is being conducted by the Frankfurt public prosecutors'
office.
It is understood that data relating to the Geneva firm's account with the
Frankfurt branch of investment bank Merck Finck &amp; Co were the target of a
search by federal tax investigators at the bank on July 13.
The trading account is believed to have been active for more than 10 years
and dealt almost national financial centre.
Ironically, the start of the latest investigations virtually coincides with
the introduction in Germany - two years later than the European Union's
proposed deadline - of new laws making insider trading an offence punishable
with a jail sentence of up to five years.
Insider trading does not become illegal in Germany until August 1. Under the
current voluntary code of practice the most severe sanction is the loss of a
broker's trading licence.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Fininvest executive admits he paid bribes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A senior manager of Fininvest, the media empire owned by Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, yesterday admitted to paying three
bribes to members of the Guardia di Finanza, the financial police.
The admission was made by Mr Salvatore Sciascia, head of Fininvest's tax
department, according to Mr Guido Viola, his lawyer. Mr Sciascia handed
himself in for interrogation to Milan magistrates.
The payments were made at a time when Mr Berlusconi was still actively in
charge of Fininvest, and are certain to embarrass the prime minister.
Within the rightwing coalition, Mr Berlusconi was beginning to look isolated
yesterday. The populist Northern League and the neo-fascist MSI/National
Alliance declined to condemn the action by the Milan magistrates so soon
after the magistrates had forced the government to withdraw a controversial
decree on preventive detention.
Mr Berlusconi has been strongly criticised by the opposition for failing to
understand the conflict of interest between his role as prime minister and
that of owner of Fininvest.
He was also under fire yesterday for holding a crisis meeting at his Milan
villa on Sunday with close members of his government - all former Fininvest
employees - as well as with lawyers of his younger brother Paolo and of Mr
Sciascia.
Mr Paolo Berlusconi is understood to be on a list of people under
investigation by Milan magistrates in relation to the Guardia di Finanza
affair.
An arrest warrant on corruption charges was issued on Saturday for Mr
Sciascia, for another member of Fininvest's tax department and for 21 other
businessmen and Guardia di Finanza officials.
This was part of a broad-ranging inquiry by Milan magistrates into a
well-organised procedure among members of the Guardia di Finanza, taking
bribes in return for 'friendly' tax assessments and inspections of company
balance sheets.
According to Mr Viola, his client paid L100m (Pounds 41,350) in two tranches
in 1989 relating to the affairs of Videotime, a key Fininvest television
production company.
A further L100m was paid relating to an inspection of Mediolanum, the
group's life insurance company.
Mr Sciascia also admitted a L130m payment in 1992 relating to an inspection
of Fininvest's Mondadori publishers. He had not been previously charged over
this payment.
However, he denied a L25m payment relating to the affairs of Telepiu, the
pay-TV channel.

FT  26 JUL 94 / Jordan and Israel agree trade pact for peace: Leaders end
46-year-old state of war and move towards Mideast common market
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel and Jordan formally ended a 46-year-old state of war in a White House
summit yesterday and agreed an unexpectedly broad package of measures
towards normal relations and the creation of a Middle East common market.
Although 'The Washington Declaration' signed by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli
prime minister, and King Hussein of Jordan falls short of an official peace
treaty it marks a historic change in a region torn apart for almost half a
century by war, hostility and mutual suspicion.
Sunshine bathed the ceremony, and King Hussein and Mr Rabin repeatedly shook
hands enthusiastically throughout the day. After the first handshake Mr
Rabin said: 'Your Majesty, the entire state of Israel is shaking your hand.'
US president Bill Clinton said: 'As this century draws to a close, a new era
of peace opens before us in ancient lands as brave men choose reconciliation
over conflict.'
Underlining the economic incentives driving the Israeli-Jordanian peace
efforts, the five-page declaration called for an immediate series of
confidence-building measures to inaugurate a new era of trade, tourism and
regional integration which will stimulate the economies of both nations.
Among the measures agreed are: direct telephone links; opening two new
border crossings; granting free passage to third country tourists; linking
the two countries' electricity grids; and speeding up negotiations on an
international air corridor and co-operation between the Jordanian and
Israeli police forces.
The declaration also pledged both sides to accelerate bilateral negotiations
over border disputes and water issues, and, after much US and Israeli
pressure, Jordan also agreed to suspend its part of the Arab boycott of
Israeli goods and companies.
The document also preserved King Hussein's role as guardian of the Islamic
holy sites in Jerusalem and accorded a high priority to Jordan's historic
role as guardian in final status talks on the future of the Holy City.
Mr Rabin said the package of measures was much wider than the two sides
planned when they agreed to the summit 10 days ago and marked the fact that
trade and economic relations would be the foundation of Middle East peace.
The declaration, Mr Rabin said: 'Bears witness to our ability in Israel and
Jordan to accelerate our efforts toward peace, to overcome obstacles, to
achieve a breakthrough and to put an end to 46 years of hostility.'
Mr Clinton described the economic measures as 'the building blocks of a
modern peace in ancient holy lands'.
Both sides pledged to meet continuously until a peace treaty could be
signed. Earlier Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said: 'I think
it is only a matter of months until there's a formal peace agreement.'

Mr Peter Kindersley, founder and chairman of the illustrated books publisher
Dorling Kindersley, is a passionate advocate of employee share ownership.
Yesterday he put more than Pounds 2.6m of his own money where his mouth is.
Mr Kindersley said he would make 950,000 of his shares - 1.5 per cent of the
company - available to executives in a private share option incentive
scheme.
Some 20 executives will benefit from the windfall gift, as long as they
remain with Dorling Kindersley until September 30 1996 and March 29 1997.
The executives, only three of whom are on the main board, will have an
option to buy the shares at 16p - the price at which executives were offered
options just before the company came to the market at the end of 1992 -
against last night's close of 292p. The largest beneficiary will be entitled
to 175,000 shares.
If all the options are taken up, Mr Kindersley will receive a total payment
of Pounds 152,000 for the shares, more than Pounds 2.6m less than
yesterday's market value. He will still have a 40.1 per cent stake, worth
Pounds 72m.
He denied yesterday that the gesture was remarkable, preferring to emphasise
the future benefits he expected to accrue to the company - and to his own
reduced stake. 'I hope in time I will not feel this at all,' he said.
Mr Kindersley attacked the limitations imposed on option schemes by UK
institutional shareholders. 'In the US institutions realise the importance
of motivating staff. Here, the reaction is that it is some sort of
dilution,' he said. This way, institutions would not suffer and, he
believed, eventually his own holding would be enhanced.
One executive who will benefit from Mr Kindersley's unorthodox gesture said
institutions should be grateful. 'They probably owe Peter a drink for taking
this on himself,' he said.
The Covent Garden-based company is a pioneer in the multimedia field. It
produces illustrated reference books and futuristic multimedia products,
which use CD and computer technology to combine text, images and sound.
The company's books are conceived from the outset as an integral combination
of images and words, with captions wrapped round high quality photographs
and graphics, printed on clear white backgrounds.
Microsoft, the US computer software group, holds a 20 per cent stake in
Dorling Kindersley.
Last year, the chief executive of a computer games distributor, Centregold,
gave his managing director shares worth Pounds 330,000.

turnround - US carmakers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Confirmation that the turnround of the big US carmakers is continuing is
likely to come later this week, as General Motors and Ford report
second-quarter figures. Chrysler unveiled strong results two weeks ago,
adding to optimism about the outlook for its biggest rivals. Ford is
expected to report a further big step in the return of its European
operations to profit for 1994, after three years of losses. General Motors,
meanwhile, continues to look to strong demand in the US and the
restructuring of its North American operations to continue its turnround
there.

The two chemical giants are expected to report advances in second-quarter
profits this week, reflecting higher sales volumes in an improving economy.
Last week, Monsanto and Arco Chemical topped most earnings predictions,
thanks to the strength of demand from US car and housing markets. Du Pont is
expected to report a rise in earnings per share from 79 cents to between
Dollars 1.00-Dollars 1.10, while Dow Chemical should see a more modest
rebound.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Salinas to play on trade expertise in WTO fight: Aides say
Mexican president will emphasise his political experience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Carlos Salinas will launch his campaign to head the new World
Trade Organisation after Mexico's August presidential election.
Advisers to Mr Salinas say that for domestic political reasons he will make
no public pronouncements on the position until September. He wants to avoid
accusations that he is putting personal ambitions before the country's
interests.
However, aides have outlined the sort of campaign he is expected to run. He
will emphasise his record as president of Mexico, which makes him the best
known of the four contenders, his long experience and interest in
international trade issues, and his belief that the WTO should not be
side-tracked from its main objective of promoting free trade and reducing
protectionist barriers.
The Mexican government expects the US to back Mr Salinas's candidacy. It
also reckons Latin American countries, apart from Brazil, which has its own
candidate, and Argentina, will, as they have already promised, support the
Mexican president. Mr Manuel Tello, Mexico's foreign minister, was in Chile
this week drumming up support for Mr Salinas.
Mr Salinas believes that 'point number one on the agenda is to make the WTO
an efficient and effective institution to promote freer trade in the world.'
As head of the WTO, he would have 'to make sure the multilateral system and
Uruguay Round work properly.'
Mr Salinas has reservations about incorporating strict labour and
environmental standards in world trade laws, as the US wants. An aide said
Mr Salinas believed the linkages between trade laws, environment and labour
conditions needed to be studied further, and that agreed-on standards
'should never be an excuse to build protectionist barriers.'
President Salinas sides with most developing countries in believing that the
best way to protect the environment and labour rights is by promoting trade
and raising the incomes of poor countries.
Nevertheless, under the North American Free trade Agreement, Mexico bowed to
US pressure and agreed to accept fines or sanctions if found not to be
enforcing some of its own labour and environmental laws. In the Nafta
negotiations, President Salinas was more willing to subject enforcement of
Mexico's environmental laws to US and Canadian scrutiny than enforcement of
domestic labour laws.
An aide stressed that Mr Salinas would set an agenda on the so-called new
issues in agreement with WTO members. Mr Salinas, he said, had a 'deep
knowledge' of both first and third world countries, which might make it
easier for him to appreciate the different interests of participating
countries, and build a consensus among members.
The long drawn out negotiations over Nafta have made Mr Salinas familiar
with the key issues of international trade. He was closely involved in the
Nafta negotiations, personally taking many of the key decisions on where to
give ground to the US, and the same kind of hands-on approach could be
expected if he was given the WTO job, the aide said.
'He combines a unique feature of being able to deal with the broad issues
and also to get into the details.' Mr Salinas, who has doctorate in
political economy from Harvard University, has been dealing with trade
issues since the mid-1980s, when he spearheaded Mexico's entry into Gatt
while budget minister.
Although Mr Salinas has pushed through Nafta, and several regional trade
agreements between Mexico and other countries and Latin America, his
emphasis would be on a multilateral approach to free trade. His aide said he
would seek to ensure that regional agreements are consistent with Gatt
articles.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BANJUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A US warship carrying ousted Gambian President Sir Dawda Jawara steamed out
of Banjul yesterday while the leader of the coup which toppled him received
ambassadors and religious leaders, Reuter reports from Banjul.
Diplomats said the US Navy tank-landing ship La Moure County carrying Mr
Jawara, members of his family and senior officials was believed to be
heading for Dakar, capital of neighbouring Senegal.
Religious leaders who met coup leader Lieutenant Yayeh Jameh said he told
them that he and Mr Jawara had spoken but failed to agree terms for the
president to return.
Mr Jawara fled to the US warship after young army officers on Saturday
announced a coup against him after what began as a rampage through Banjul on
Friday by soldiers demanding back pay.
Officials said 10 Nigerian officers working with the military had been put
under house arrest. They included the former commander of the 800-strong
Gambian army, Colonel Boubakar Dada, who was preparing to leave Gambia.
The capital Banjul was calm, the market was open and people were going about
their business normally. An overnight curfew was in force from 7pm to 7am.
Officials said Mr Jawara, the first of his two wives Lady Chilele Jawara,
and about 14 of his 19 children were on the US ship with the finance
minister and inspector general of police.
They said the justice minister had been arrested, as had the information
minister and Vice President Saihou Sabally. The education minister, Mr Alieu
Badjie, gave himself up on Saturday morning.
Mr Jawara was prime minister when Gambia won independence from Britain in
1965 and became president when it became a republic in 1970.

<TEXT>
A senior military delegation from India arrived in Moscow yesterday for
talks on co-operation with Russia and possible aircraft purchases, Itar-Tass
news agency reported. The delegation, led by air force Commander-in-Chief S
K Kaul, would meet senior defence ministry and arms industry officials
during the one-week visit and examine the latest models of Russian combat
aircraft. 'He (Kaul) is also likely to negotiate purchases of MiG-29
fighter-bombers and SU-30 multi-purpose fighters,' the agency said, adding
that India might consider buying a licence to make SU-30s. The two sides
will also discuss modernisation of MiG-21 fighters in service with the
Indian air force and creation of a joint Russian-Indian aircraft venture,
Tass said, quoting an Indian embassy official. Russia and India agreed to
step up military co-operation in a joint declaration signed by President
Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao during a visit by the
latter to Moscow last month. Russia was India's biggest arms supplier in the
Soviet era, but sales have slumped since then.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Abkhazia looks to ties with Moscow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only the 'closest ties' to Russia would ensure the successful development of
Abkhazia, the breakaway region of Georgia, according to Mr Vladislav
Ardzimba, the region's leader.
Speaking to the first world congress of ethnic Abkhazians in the capital of
Sukhumi, Mr Ardzimba said that Abkhazia was a 'de facto sovereign state'. He
said that none of the documents he had signed with the United Nations or
Russia - which has provided a peacekeeping presence of some 3,000 troops
with UN agreement - linked the region with Georgia.
Georgian troops were driven out of Abkhazia last year after bitter fighting,
especially for control of Sukhumi. Since then, the region, to Georgia's
north-west, has been sealed off from the rest of the country and the
Georgian refugees denied re-entry.
Mr Ardzimba's comments are in line with the long-term aim of the Abkhazian
leadership to break links with the Georgian government in Tbilisi and bring
Abkhazia into a union - formal or informal - with Russia. The Georgian
population, which before the civil war had made up the majority in Abkhazia,
has largely fled to Georgia, where its presence is greatly exacerbating the
economic collapse of the country and raising fears of a humanitarian crisis
this winter.
Figures published by the Russian statistical office Goskomstat show that
Georgian industrial output has halved over the past year - the sharpest fall
of any of the members of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
Turkmenistan the main supplier of gas to Georgia, is threatening to cut
supplies because of unpaid bills amounting to Dollars 300m.
Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, Georgian leader and former Soviet foreign minister,
is under increasing pressure from opposition politicians who accuse him of
capitulating to Russian pressure and of having given up the fight to retake
Abkhazia. He has warned of food and energy shortages this winter and faces a
collapse of civil order as the currency is rendered increasingly worthless
by inflation.

FT  25 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Fund charge puts PaineWebber in red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PaineWebber incurred a net loss of Dollars 25.1m in the second quarter of
1994 after the US securities firm was forced to take a charge to cover the
injection of Dollars 34m into one of its mutual funds to repay investors for
losses on mortgage-backed securities.
Last week, two executives at PaineWebber involved in the management of the
troubled Dollars 1bn short-term government bond fund resigned over the
matter, and the firm brought in an outside money management group, Pacific
Investment Management, to act as a consultant in the running of the fund.
Even without the cost of the fund bail-out, the second quarter was a
difficult period for the firm, with pre-charge earnings of Dollars 9.1m
falling well short of the Dollars 59.3m reported for the same quarter a year
ago.
The sharp drop in earnings during the quarter came against the background of
a 15.7 per cent decline in revenues to Dollars 579m.
Revenues fell because demand for PaineWebber's broking services from retail
and institutional customers and for its underwriting services from companies
and municipal authorities were either flat or substantially lower compared
with the same quarter of 1993.
Also, the firm earned considerably less in the period (Dollars 91.7m against
Dollars 181.9m a year earlier) from the trading of its own capital on US and
foreign securities markets.
In this respect, PaineWebber was no different than other big Wall Street
firms, which all saw their revenues and profits fall in the second quarter
because of the slowdown in the once-booming securities industry.

Monday: Japan and the US will be key focuses of market attention this week,
with a spate of statistics for economists to feed on. Japan's trade balance
for the first 10 days of June today will be watched with interest in light
of the ongoing weakness of the dollar against the yen.
Tuesday: On the domestic front, Japan's coincident and leading diffusion
indexes for May, published today, should provide further indication that
business sentiment is improving. In the US, July's consumer confidence data
is likely to show confidence flattening out, albeit at high levels.
Wednesday: More indications about the strength of the US economic recovery
will emerge today with the publication of June durable goods data. In Japan,
June's retail sales are expected to show a year on year fall, albeit at a
slower rate than last month.
Friday: More US and Japanese data round off the week, with Japan's
construction data expected to indicate a slow pick-up in this sector. US
advance GDP data are forecast to show a rise, year-on-year, of 3.65 per cent
for the second quarter of this year, up from 3.4 per cent in the first
quarter.

MONDAY 25
Israel-Jordan summit
Israel's prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, and King Hussein of Jordan hold a
summit in Washington, marking the rapid pace of the unfolding Middle East
peace process.
The meeting will be a public affirmation that the Israeli-Jordanian peace
process is irreversible and that Israel is on the way to its second peace
treaty with an Arab neighbour since the Egyptian-Israeli accord of 1979.
A formal treaty, still several months away, will be preceded by joint
projects in tourism, trade, environment and regional development. Borders,
commercial flights and telephone lines may be opened in a first step towards
a regionally integrated market which has been the dream of Shimon Peres,
Israel's foreign minister.
The US will encourage and underwrite many of the projects and has
demonstrated its support by promising to present to Congress a bill to write
off Dollars 950m of Jordanian debt. Both Mr Rabin and King Hussein will
address Congress on Tuesday.
The Asean Regional Forum, bringing together 18 countries to discuss
political and security issues in Asia, meets for the first time in Bangkok.
In addition to the six members of the Association of South East Asian
Nations, among those attending are the US, China and Russia. The crisis over
North Korea's nuclear programme and the civil war in Cambodia are among the
likely topics for discussion, but the meeting may focus on defining ARF's
future role. The forum was established in response to the uncertainty in the
region after the end of the cold war.
Ecowas, the Economic Community of West African States, begins its annual
meeting in Abuja, leading to the heads of states' meeting on Thursday and
Friday. Ecowas has made little progress towards its target of economic and

the Francophone states' common currency, the CFA franc.
UK tank delivery: Sir Colin Chandler, chief executive of the Vickers
engineering company, hands over the first completed Challenger 2 tank to the
British Army in a ceremony at the company's Barnbow factory in Leeds. It is
the first of 146 tanks in the first production run which was supplemented by

Whitewater hearing begins
The US House of Representatives banking committee holds the first
congressional hearings into any aspect of the Whitewater affair, which
concerns Arkansas property deals, loans, and President Clinton and his wife
Hillary. The session will focus on contacts between the White House and
other government regulatory agencies.
Among those due to testify are 'Mack' McLarty, former White House chief of
staff and now senior counsellor, Margaret Ann Williams, chief of staff to
Hillary Rodham Clinton, and Lloyd Cutler, White House legal counsel.
The Senate banking committee is due to hold parallel hearings beginning
either Wednesday or Thursday.
Taiwan courts Gatt: Negotiations resume in Geneva on Taiwan's bid to join
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Taiwan hopes to be a member by
the year-end, but Beijing insists on being admitted first (see Friday).
UK economy: The Confederation of British Industry quarterly industrial
trends survey will be watched for signs that the UK economic recovery is
triggering more investment. Previous surveys have a bearish attitude to
investment, in spite of the gradual growth in manufacturing.
Companies' pricing expectations during the next four months are also likely
to be another key topic of interest, in light of the recent rise in the cost
of raw materials and components.
Spanish strike: Workers at Spanish car-maker Seat, a subsidiary of Germany's
Volkswagen, have called a 24-hour strike. They object to a proposed 10 per
cent pay-cut and the failure of management to offer any job guarantees in
return.
UK rail strikes: Signalworkers for Railtrack, owner of most of the
infrastructure of Britain's rail network, step up their pay dispute with
their first 48-hour stoppage, beginning at noon.
Travellers have experienced 24-hour stoppages on the past six Wednesdays.

WEDNESDAY 27
Thai confidence vote
Thai opposition parties are due to launch a no-confidence debate in
parliament against four ministers in the governing coalition, including
Prasong Soonsiri, the foreign minister who is simultaneously hosting a
series of meetings for the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean).
Political commentators predict that the government will survive the debate,
but some members of the coalition's Palang Dharma (Moral Force) party have
threatened to vote against their own cabinet ministers because of
disagreements within the party.
Wheat heat:
US and Canadian trade ministers Mickey Kantor (left) and Roy Maclaren sit
down to try to negotiate a deal which would avoid US curbs on Canadian durum
wheat exports and possibly other commodities. The US International Trade
Commission has already found Canada guilty of dumping its wheat in the US.
EU social policy: The European Commission is due to approve social affairs
commissioner Padraig Flynn's white paper on social policy at a meeting in
Brussels.
Bangladesh's main opposition party, the Awami League, plans a big rally to
press its demand for an early election under an interim administration.

on The Role and Limits of the State.
Bank of England tercentenary:
A distinguished Old Lady celebrates her birthday. The Queen, leading
politicians and top City figures attend a service of thanksgiving in St
Paul's Cathedral to mark the 300th anniversary of the date the Bank of
England's charter was sealed. Unlike most of us, the Bank is gaining
strength as it grows older. Eddie George, its governor, now exercises a more
powerful influence over monetary policy than any of his recent predecessors.
FT Surveys: Bank of England's 300th Anniversary and Tunisia.
Holidays: Belarus (Independence Day), Bosnia and Hercegovina.

to help forge a reconciliation between North and South Yemen are due to
start in Paris after their two-month civil war.
Abiola trial: Moshood Abiola is to be tried for treason by Nigeria's
military regime today in a specially convened high court in Abuja. Mr Abiola
was arrested last month when he declared himself president on the
anniversary of his victory in the annulled presidential election.
General Sani Abacha has promised to start a new transition to civilian rule
some time next year, but is facing mounting opposition and a national strike
in the vital oil industry.
Japanese economy: Industrial production figures out today should give
further evidence that the Japanese recession is bottoming out. Analysts
expect the growth rate to pick up in June, after a year-on-year fall of 1.2
per cent in May.
UK water pricing: The water industry regulator, Ian Byatt, publishes his
long-awaited price controls for UK water companies at a time when
fast-rising water charges have been widely criticised. The controls will
dictate how much companies can increase prices during the next 10 years,
taking account of inflation and their obligations to modernise the water
system.
Holidays: Peru (Independence Day).
FRIDAY 29
China discusses Gatt terms
Members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade meet in Geneva to
discuss the terms on which China will be re-admitted to the world trade
body.
Beijing, exasperated by the delay in concluding the seven-year-old
negotiations, says it will submit one last trade liberalisation offer but is
not prepared to join Gatt at any cost.
The hard bargaining is expected in September, as China tries to beat the
deadline for Gatt membership by year-end, enabling it to become a founder
member of Gatt's successor, the World Trade Organisation.
Islamic fundamentalists in Bangladesh plan a march to the capital Dhaka as
part of their campaign against Taslima Nasreen, 32, a feminist writer

novel, 'Lajja' (Shame), portraying the sufferings of Bangladesh's Hindu
minority.
Lloyds kicks off the UK clearing banks' interim results season. Its
prospects are affected by uncertainty over its proposed Pounds 1.8bn

Pre-tax profits of about Pounds 850m are expected.
Real deadline: Today is the last chance for Brazilians to exchange their old
currency, the cruzeiro, for the real, which was introduced on July 1.
WEEKEND 30-31
Ministers meet on Bosnia
Foreign ministers from the five-nation contact group on Bosnia meet in
Geneva on Saturday to decide what to do after the failure of the latest,
supposedly final, peace plan. Options include tighter sanctions on Serbia,
more rigorous enforcement of 'no-fly' and exclusion zones, and lifting the
arms embargo for the Bosnian government.
Taiwanese and mainland Chinese negotiators start talks on Saturday in
Taipei.
On the agenda are fishing disputes, the return of illegal immigrants to the
island and the repatriation of airline hijackers. The last round of talks
was held in March. Five previous rounds have been unsuccessful.
Sailing: Cowes Week begins on Saturday (to August 6).
South Pacific Forum: The 25th annual meeting begins in Brisbane on Sunday
(to August 2). Delegates will consider how the Forum's structure and
procedures are adapting to economic changes in the region, and its
relationship with other institutions, especially the Association of South
East Asian Nations and the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum.
Motor racing: The German Grand Prix takes place at Hockenheim, near
Heidelberg, on Sunday.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Emerging Markets: Brazil's stock market hopes ride on the
real - The Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The long-awaited arrival of Brazil's new currency, the real, could prove the
launching pad for a soaring stock market. Inflation is expected to fall
dramatically, helping the financial markets' preferred presidential
candidate, Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, and possibly paving the way for
longer-term economic reforms.
But the continuing political uncertainties surrounding the October elections
and an overvaluation of the new currency have so far prevented a large
capital inflow. The real, which is linked to Brazil's foreign exchange
reserves of nearly Dollars 40bn, was introduced on July 1 and should result
in a fall in monthly inflation from 50 per cent in June to less than 10 per
cent this month.
Local investors are betting that the real, which is part of a government
anti-inflation plan, will lead to the election of Mr Cardoso, the former
finance minister who negotiated the plan through Congress. Mr Cardoso, who
is regarded by the financial markets as a modernist, has been trailing Mr
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the left-wing Workers Party in the opinion
polls, although the gap has narrowed significantly since the real was
introduced.
'A lot of investors are not afraid of Lula but of the reaction to him,' says
Mr George Rexing, a director at the Brazilian bank Banco Indusval, referring
to estimates that the market could suffer a short-term fall of 50 per cent
or more if Mr da Silva were to win.
Nevertheless, the relatively smooth introduction of the real, coupled with a
stronger showing in the polls for Mr Cardoso, has lifted Sao Paulo's
volatile stock market index by about 11 per cent so far this month. The
bullish scenario sees a huge fall in monthly inflation, to between 2 and 5
per cent from August onwards, and a grateful electorate voting for Mr
Cardoso in a second ballot in mid-November.
If Mr Cardoso were to carry out radical reforms to public finances, analysts
believe shares could more than triple in value during his presidency.
They base the prediction on equities' growth in other countries where fiscal
reforms have been made such as Mexico, Argentina and Chile. Currently,
Brazil's stock market capitalisation represents about 25 per cent of gross
domestic product compared with about 50 per cent for Mexico.
Even without reforms the Brazilian market has shown impressive, if volatile,
growth in the past. Last year the main Sao Paulo index doubled in dollar
terms, partly fuelled by a net overseas inflow of Dollars 5.5bn to the
capital markets. The potential for Brazilian equities has attracted the
interest of many foreign investors, but most have not yet decided to take
the plunge because of the political uncertainty.
According to Mr Julius Buchenrode, head of investments at Chase Manhattan's
Brazilian subsidiary, there has been a big increase in recent months in
registrations with the bank from foreign, mainly US, mutual funds, pension
funds and trusts.
Another worry among foreigners has been an overvaluation of the new
currency. The central bank, which has not intervened at all in the foreign
exchange market since the first day of the real, has let the currency
appreciate on the open market by 7 to 8 per cent, roughly reflecting the
interest rate differential between Brazil and international markets.
The result of the overvaluation has been that shares are now more expensive
in dollar terms and there is some exchange rate risk for foreign investors
entering the market as most analysts expect the dollar to revalue as
Brazilian interest rates fall. Before the real, the central bank devalued
the cruzeiro on a daily basis in line with inflation.
The exchange rate risk has contributed to keeping overseas investors out of
the market and the climb in equities this month has been caused almost
entirely by local investors, brokers say.
The overvaluation could hit exporters. Most of the big exporters closed
contracts before the real but smaller companies will suffer, according to Mr
Ricardo Gallo, a director at Bank of Boston's Sao Paulo office.
Another sector that could come under pressure is the banks. They could
suffer reduced third-quarter results as they will no longer be able to make
easy profits from interest-free floats. However, the fall in inflation
should be partly offset by the introduction of charges for many services.
Shares that could prove attractive are those related to consumer spending.
Purchasing power among the poor, who did not have access to inflation-linked
savings accounts, is expected to increase substantially and could boost
profits in the food, drink and clothing sectors.
If a Cardoso election victory appeared probable, investors could start to
bring more dollars into the market. But this would spark central bank
concerns about money supply targets as the bank would have to issue reals in
exchange for dollars, putting pressure on the monetary base, widely regarded
as the key to the success of the real.
If it got out of hand, the government could attempt to deter a large inflow
of foreign capital by a financial operations tax on foreign investment in
equities. Currently there is just a 15 per cent withholding tax on
dividends.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Equity Markets: UK back on course for the recovery - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a heady feeling of 'Christmas in August' in the stock market, as
signs that the worst may be over for the dollar have invited investors in
the UK market to celebrate growing evidence of strong and accelerating
economic growth and subdued inflation.
The next round of corporate results, still more than a month away, is likely
to bring further gains in dividends and earnings. This week brings little
for markets to worry about, with the latest industrial trends survey from
the Confederation of British Industries expected to confirm market
confidence. And both the Federal Reserve and the Bundesbank have now wound
down for the summer holidays.
No wonder one leading analyst refers to the current UK economic experience
as 'something of a Golden Age', even if he admits that a more negative
interpretation is that the current scenario may not be all that different
from previous cyclical recoveries.
The FT-SE 100 Index is now around 9 per cent up from the low points touched
at the end of last month, so it is not surprising that some of the technical
chartists are becoming nervous. Derivative Securities, the futures
technicians, regard FT-SE 3,135 as a 'still valid' ceiling for the market at
present, although the firm is not advising clients to sell just yet.
Overbought markets, which Derivative Securities judges this one to be, can
persist in that state for some time when the underlying mood is confident.
For the true bear case, on the global as well as UK markets scale, nervous
investors must turn to Nomura Securities, which continues to express caution
on equities because it believes that stronger than expected economic growth
leads to higher than expected inflation and interest rates - casting doubts
over the widespread optimism for corporate earnings growth.
There is some support from other securities houses for Nomura's fears that
the dollar remains vulnerable. 'We are still not entirely convinced . . .'
says NatWest Securities. But most London-based analysts stress that last
week's renewed uncertainties over the dollar and near-term prospects for US
interest rates have failed to restrain bond or equity markets in Europe.
De-coupling, in fact, appears to be here at least. Mr Albert Edwards at
Kleinwort Benson believes there is no reason why US growth and inflation
should affect non-US markets 'other than in a marginal and sentimental
manner'.
However, in spite of the general euphoria, there is still no rush by City
analysts to upgrade UK market forecasts for the year. After a very
difficult, and often painfully expensive, first half to 1994, the mood is
that the market is back on course for the recovery thwarted so far this year
by the savage collapse in bond markets.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Emerging Markets: Egyptian market set to expand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Egypt's illiquid stock market is in for a relative bonanza, writes Mark
Nicholson in Cairo. Some five public sector companies are set to float
shares by the end of the year under the government's privatisation programme
 -moves which should more than double the number of actively traded stocks
on the exchange.
Although Cairo's bourse lists 674 companies, only 20 or so trade actively
and only two or three, including Suez Cement and Commercial International
Bank, resemble anything like 'alpha' stocks.
But next month - the launch date remains to be set - Ameriya Cement Company
should join this elite. The government Holding Company for Metallurgical
Industries is to float 4m of Ameriya's 20m shares in an issue which local
brokers say is already oversubscribed by orders from local investors and
international emerging market funds.
Shares will be floated in two tranches: the first 2m shares, open only to
individual investors with a cap of 5,000 shares per applicant; and the
second 2m open to institutional investors some six months later. A further
2m shares will be sold to the company's Employee Share Ownership
Association.
Banque Misr, the bank handling the sale, has not announced a price, but
brokers expect EPounds 27 a share (Dollars 8). Management of Ameriya,
regarded as one of Egypt's most efficient public sector companies, has
already promised to pay a EPounds 3 per share dividend in December based on
earnings so far this fiscal year. One of Egypt's newest broking companies
says it already has 5m orders for the stock, most from overseas emerging
market funds.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Equity Markets: Foreign buyers gear up for German
privatisations - International offerings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For years, the chance to get a significant slice of Germany's untold wealth
of companies has been an impossible dream for international investors
because of the labyrinthine cross-holdings and the stakes which are held by
the country's biggest banks and companies or by the state.
But the ever-stronger need for capital, which can no longer be met
exclusively by Germany's banking sector or, in the government's case, by the
bond market, is causing these corporate edifices to dismantle.
'The big companies and banks now realise that they have to move with the
times and they are starting to use the equity market more fully to satisfy
the requirements of capital,' says Mr John St John, director of equity
capital markets at Kleinwort Benson in London.
As far as the state is concerned, a considerable slug of its assets has
already been sold off in recent years but more privatisations are expected
in the next year. International investors are gearing up for a further
tranche of shares in Lufthansa, the national airline, which is scheduled to
come up for sale in early autumn.
In May, the government approved plans for the progressive privatisation of
Lufthansa and promised to reduce its stake in a first step from 51.4 to 38
per cent by not participating in a rights issue. Bankers forecast that
Lufthansa will receive up to DM2bn of new capital from the operation.
They also believe Lufthansa will not offer the shares to US investors, by
way of a 144a offering, to limit the risk of excessive foreign ownership
which could jeopardise its national flag carrier status. A second tranche to
dispose of the entire state shareholding could be sold before the end of
1995.
However, the government's long-awaited privatisation of Deutsche Telekom,
Germany's telecommunications company, is expected to be a truly global
affair with the 'book-building' process, internationally acknowledged as an
efficient way of getting the best price by flushing out all potential
buyers, playing a central role.
Market valuations of the company range from DM60bn to DM100bn, which suggest
that the sale of the first tranche of the shares could yield between DM15bn
and DM20bn. But investors are likely to have to wait until late 1995 or even
1996 before the shares come up for sale.
Meanwhile, the need for capital, either to plug holes in public finances or
to pay for long-term social infrastructure programmes, is compelling the
west German Lander (states) and cities to join in the privatisation drive.
Ms Ingeborg Elisabeth Buhl at Deutsche Bank Research in Frankfurt says that,
although several Lander substantially reduced the number of their holdings
in the 1980s, the value of their assets has risen appreciably in the last
decade.
'Privatisation has enormous potential at Lander level,' says Ms Buhl, though
she points out that state interests in shoring up regional industrial
locations and jobs could slow this process.
Nevertheless, there are overwhelming signs that the Lander now regard
privatisation as the solution to their financial needs. Bavaria has already
conducted several privatisations and the next on the agenda is the sale of
its 33.8 per cent share in Rhein-Main-Donau, the company operating the canal
linking Germany's two main rivers with the Danube.
Meanwhile, Baden-Wurttemberg plans to sell off loss-making operations,
including its world-famous spas.
The wind of change is also blowing through the boardrooms of several of
Germany's big conglomerates, which are seriously considering the sale of
non-core businesses.

Domestic issues are set to command greater interest over the coming weeks,
as the interim reporting season unrolls and a signal on the state of the
colony's property market is delivered at tomorrow's land auction, writes
Louise Lucas.
Brokers say fears of a US interest rate rise have now been largely
discounted and a clutch of good results from the corporates and a show of
healthy demand at the land auction stand to nudge the Hang Seng index
upwards.
Turnover is likely to remain above the lows of around HKDollars 2bn
witnessed earlier in the month.
The land to be offered for sale is not considered by analysts to be
especially good, but the auction itself will be the first since May 26 -
when developers bid together in big consortia to secure two parcels of land
at prices markedly lower than market expectations.
The government last week adopted a mild set of measures aimed at preventing
a recurrence.
Companies due to report their results this week include Wheelock, the Hong
Kong corporate empire of the late Sir Yue-kong Pao, which will announce its
finals on Thursday.

Uncertainty over the yen's strength is expected to weigh on prices this
week, in spite of signs of economic recovery, writes Emiko Terazono.
With the market finding buyers around 20,000-20,500 levels on the Nikkei
index, and potential sellers around 21,000, prices fluctuated in a narrow
range last week.
However, analysts point out that the yen's strength has yet to be factored
into share prices.
Although last week's Bank of Japan quarterly economic outlook was optimistic
and many of the economic figures to be released this week are expected to
indicate a pick up in activity, there is still a risk to growth from
currency movements.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd reckons a 5 per cent currency appreciation cuts GDP
growth by 50 basis points.

With renewed optimism about the economic outlook underpinning the market
last week, the focus in the coming week will be interims from Santander and
BCH. UBS recommends the banking sector, saying that sentiment is set to
improve as second-quarter results are left behind, which will lead to
increased focus on the banks' cheap fundamentals.

Investors will be hoping for a calmer atmosphere after last week's political
and budgetary excursions. However, Merrill Lynch warned clients last week
that the row over limiting magistrates' powers was unlikely to be the last
time that the government stumbles, given its lack of political experience:
it did not bode well for its chances of forcing through economic reforms.
Nevertheless, some brokers are positive on the short-term outlook, noting
that August is traditionally a strong account as local investors use summer
salary bonuses to build portfolios.

Equities have managed to remain resilient to the turbulence in Europe over
recent months. With the reporting season due to begin next week - DSM
results are expected on August 3 - it is possible that strength will be
maintained. However, Kleinwort Benson forecast last week that it was
difficult to see the market continuing to outperform the rest of Europe.
'The limited cyclicality of the index and the fact that only a modest
economic recovery is expected in Holland is likely to become a drag on
performance,' it said.
Maintaining a neutral weighting, Kleinwort's noted that the expected strong
growth in corporate earnings had already been discounted.
'We remain of the opinion that the current enthusiasm for the market's
defensive qualities will be short-lived, as investors are likely to turn
their attention towards more cyclically geared markets in the coming
months,' it said.

Worries about tomorrow's results from Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank made for
nervous trading in the sector at the end of last week, writes John Pitt.
Nevertheless, taken as a whole, the country's banking sector remains
attractive to a number of brokers.
Paribas Capital Markets expects the sector to outperform the market over the
next six months, following a period of underperformance - over the past year
banks have lagged behind by 12 to 18 per cent
'Over the last six months, sentiment has suffered from adverse publicity
concerning the banks' involvement in various scandals,' said Paribas.
It rated Deutsche a buy, arguing that the Metallgesellschaft and Schneider
involvements were likely to prove 'special cases in the German recession,
rather than the rule'.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Equity Markets: Investors leave Wall Street stuck in neutral
 -New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The second-quarter reporting season is in full swing, but Wall Street is
stuck in the summer doldrums. A fresh tide of corporate results will sweep
through Wall Street this week, but any positive impact is likely to be
limited to a few individual stocks.
Certainly last week's activity suggests as much, despite predictions of a
midsummer rally.
If the corporate sector demonstrated its profitability in the face of a
steady rise in US interest rates during the first half, the argument went,
cash would start flowing back into equities.
In the event, several of the market's bellwethers turned in outstanding
performances. Most notably IBM, Motorola and Apple. All handily beat
forecasts and were rewarded with big jumps in their share prices. But the
buying enthusiasm never spilled over to the technology sector in general.
Even worse, Compaq and Intel were hammered in spite of turning in decent
quarterly performances.
'The market is stuck in neutral,' says Mr Gregory Nie, technical analyst at
Kemper Securities in Chicago.
Indeed, investors seemed to be in the mood to nit-pick. Take the case of
United Technologies. It posted net income 32 per cent ahead of the
year-earlier level and in line with Wall Street's expectations. But analysts
cited concerns over tight margins in its automotive components arm and other
details of the report. By the end of the day, the stock was marked down 6
per cent.
General Motors and Ford lead the list of big companies set to unveil their
results this week. Both are expected to come in at the high end of
expectations, but their stocks may not fare so well. Ten days ago, shares in
Chrysler dipped even though the company posted record profits. Investors are
concerned that the recovery in motor vehicles has already passed its peak.
The recent data suggests economic growth is moderating, but the stock market
was reminded last week that the Federal Reserve's policy-makers were not
away on summer holiday. With Mr Alan Greenspan hinting that interest rates
may need to be lifted before autumn, the wait-and-see posture assumed by
many equity investors is likely to be sustained at least until after the
Fed's August 16 policy-making session.
To complicate the picture, technical conditions in the market are not
favourable, with the relationship between advancing stocks and their volumes
to declining stocks and their volumes approaching what analysts describe as
an 'overbought' position.
'We could easily go sideways for quite some time, with outside risk we could
slip into a second leg of a correction,' warns Mr Nie. 'Playing your cards
close to your vest makes sense in the near term.'

   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Jarkata's stock market has been a laggard this year with the index dipping
24 per cent in the first six months after climbing over 100 per cent last
year, but Indonesia's capital markets are likely to head for a drastic
transformation over the next few years, writes Maneula Saragosa in Jakarta.
At the sixth annual Pacific Basin capital markets conference, held in
Jakarta this month, President Suharto noted that the government needed
Dollars 330bn for its current five year development plan, and that some 73
per cent of that had to come from the private sector.
The main test of the government's commitment to developing the capital
markets hangs on abolishing the 49 per cent ceiling on foreign ownership of
listed companies. A similar ceiling for direct foreign investment has
already been lifted.
Some brokers say the ceiling could be lifted as soon as ministers return
from a global roadshow. Others are sceptical. 'I have been here for three
years and I have been hearing these promises for three years,' one said. 'In
any case, it will end up as a typical Indonesian consensus. The 49 per cent
ceiling will be lifted for initial public offerings but will not change in
the secondary market.'
There are however pressing reasons why the government should lift the
ceiling: Indosat, the state-owned telecommunications company, will be
privatised later this year and the future of other planned privatisations
could depend on its success.
Indosat will sell up to Dollars 500m worth of shares on the domestic
exchange, and as much as Dollars 1bn worth in New York. 'There is real
concern about how Indosat will place this amount on the domestic market,'
said a broker. 'If it is not a success the whole privatisation plan could go
on the back burner again.'

FT  25 JUL 94 / Equity Markets: Dollar stays focus of market attention -
Currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the Bundesbank having set out its stall for the summer, attention this
week will revert to US monetary policy, with the focus on the second quarter
GDP figure due for release on Thursday.
The market will also be monitoring the dollar, to see whether last week's
recovery was simply a technical retracement, or heralds a turnaround in the
US currency's fortunes.
Last week was characterised by a number of senior US officials pledging
their belief in the virtues of a stronger dollar. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the
treasury secretary, and his deputy Mr Larry Summers, were both prominent.
Markets were also surprised by the degree of attention Mr Alan Greenspan,
the Fed chairman, gave to the dollar during his Humphrey Hawkins testimony.
The next step will be to see whether the words will be supported by action,
in the form of higher interest rates.
With most analysts having proven too bullish in the past, they are
understandably cautious about predicting that the worst of the dollar's woes
are past. There is general agreement, though, that its prospects are better
against the D-Mark than the yen, where the trade talks remain a potentially
destabilising threat.
Investors, however, appear to be more bullish about prospects. Mr Steve
Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London, says a recent
client survey showed that most clients believe the dollar will be at
DM1.65/1.70 by the year end.
Long term dollar bears, however, remain unrepentant. Swiss Bank Corporation,
in its latest currency outlook, warns investors not to get carried away by
the dollar rally. 'The long-term weakness of the US dollar is likely to
persist,' SBC concludes, suggesting that financial markets will start buying
European currencies later this year.
In the UK the chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, and Bank of England governor,
Mr Eddie George, meet to dis-cuss monetary policy on Thursday.
There is little expectation of a near-term change in rates.

FT  25 JUL 94 / World Bond Markets: Latin America sector in the doldrums -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Among the financial markets which have been battered this year, the Latin
American bond markets have suffered more than most.
As a result, the yield spreads available on Brady bonds (created from
restructured country debt) and eurobonds relative to the US Treasuries
market now appear generous.
'Investors have attractive opportunities for capital appreciation and total
return in this asset class,' according to Mr Thomas Trebat, head of emerging
market research at Chemical Bank in New York.
'From a fundamental standpoint, the market is oversold and undervalues the
long-term commitment in Latin America to political and economic reform.'
In fact, the spreads available on much of the region's debt have ballooned
back to levels last seen several years ago. For example, in Venezuela, the
worst performer, par bonds are now trading at 1,475 basis points over the
comparable US Treasury yield, compared with 530 basis points at the start of
the year.
In recent weeks, the spread on its debt conversion bonds due 2007 has
widened to close to 2,000 basis points, from 1,269 points at the beginning
of June, as a result of the country's worsening economic and financial
situation.
Venezuelan debt is 'cheaper now than before the Brady restructuring in 1990,
when it was in default and paying no interest,' said Mr Aidan Freyne, head
of emerging market sales at Salomon Brothers Europe.
'Basically, the market is looking at the possibility of default, though I
think that's unlikely,' he said.
Even Mexican par bonds, are now trading at a spread of 520 basis points  -
wider than the level of 430 basis points at the end of 1992 - compared with
230 basis points at the start of the year.
Argentine par bonds are actually trading at a tighter spread now than at the
end of 1992, at 730 basis points, compared with 950 basis points. However,
the comparison with the start of the year, when the spread stood at 350
basis points, is still stark.
The question for investors is whether current spread levels leave room for
the sort of tightening seen in the market in 1992 and 1993. The general view
is that such a bull run for Latin American bonds cannot be repeated - and
not simply because investors have been badly burnt.
More importantly, the bearish environment for US interest rates is likely to
cap the potential performance of Latin American bonds.
'The market is very much overshadowed by the US Treasuries market,' said Mr
Peter West economic adviser at West Merchant Bank.
'One would have thought that individual countries' stories will provide some
room for tightening - for example, Mexico - but at the moment we are in the
doldrums. Just because something's cheap doesn't mean it can't go down.'
The other factor constraining the performance of the market is the fact that
the universe of investors in Latin American bonds has shrunk. Hedge funds
and mainstream fund managers who flocked to the market during the bull run
have pulled out and are unlikely to return in a hurry.
Political uncertainty has also made investors reluctant to commit funds to
these markets. But, according to Mr Freyne, 'things should clear up in about
three months, when the Mexican elections are out of the way, when we'll have
a clearer idea about who will win the Brazilian elections, and when the
situation in Venezuela may have improved.'
For the moment, however, investor flows are very thin. This has taken its
toll on the new-issues sector, where the supply of eurobonds has all but
ground to a halt.
The volume of external bond offerings in the second quarter of the year fell
below Dollars 1bn per month, according to West Merchant Bank.
Volume in the first half of the year totalled Dollars 8.4bn, mostly
concentrated in the first few months before the reversal in the US interest
rate cycle. By contrast, for the second half of 1993, volume was close to
Dollars 16bn.
The effect of the decline in capital flows to Latin America could be higher
domestic interest rates in some countries, as governments and companies are
forced to step up borrowing in their own markets, which could, in turn,
cause a slowdown in growth.
On the other hand, there are some balancing factors. Rising commodity prices
and the strength of the US economy are both positive for these countries.
In the coming months, occasional country-specific news and pauses in the
upward trend in US interest rates may allow short-lived rallies in Latin
American fixed-rate bonds to take place.
However, in an environment of rising interest rates, investors seeking a
low-volatility exposure to Latin American markets may be better off holding
floating-rate notes, which have recently outperformed fixed-rate bonds.

Friday's release of advance data on the growth of Gross Domestic Product in
the second quarter is the main event of the week on the bond market but the
figures seem unlikely to give much of a clue as to the future direction of
the yield on the long bond, which ended the week still hovering at just
above 7.5 per cent.
Wall Street expects GDP growth to come in at around 4 per cent, up from 3.4
per cent in the first quarter. The pick-up has not been driven by consumer
spending, which is thought to have grown by no more than 1 per cent, but by
a build-up in inventories.
The growth in inventories can be read two ways. Manufacturers, wholesalers
and retailers may simply have misread demand during the period. If so,
production should fall off in the third quarter, making manufacturing
capacity constraints less of a concern. That would be good news for
inflation and, by implication, the bond market. Alternatively, the
second-quarter inventory picture may reflect a greater confidence about
future consumer spending, and an intended reversal of the long-term trend
towards lower inventory levels.
After the Fed chairman's growing warnings about inflation last week, the
bond market may decide to mark time ahead of next week's more significant
employment data, due on Friday.

The gilt edged market's attention will be focused on Wednesday's auction of
Pounds 2bn of conventional 6 1/4 per cent long dated stock due 2010. The
auction is the first of stock maturing beyond 10 years since January and
will be watched closely for signs of interest among international investors,
who might be tempted by hopes of a currency gain.
Although recent indicators suggest economic growth above the long-term
trend, worries about inflation are unlikely to be sufficiently pronounced to
upset the sale.
The issue came at the lower end of expectations in terms of size and is
likely to meet demand from such traditional UK investors as pension funds
and insurance companies.
It also follows a period of improving sentiment in the market, which has
seen yields on 10 benchmark bonds drop to around 8.3 per cent from about 9
per cent six weeks ago.
The big question is whether the market's fortunes have changed for the
better or whether we have seen a rally in a bear market.
Mr Kevin Gardiner, Morgan Stanley's UK economist, is pessimistic and
forecasts that yields will be back at 9 per cent in December.
However, Mr Adam Chester of Yamaichi International expects yields to fall to
8 per cent by the year's end, reflecting a benign inflation environment.

FT  25 JUL 94 / World Bond Markets: Greenspan deflates Wall Street optimism
 -Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just when it seemed safe for investors to wade back into the US Treasury
market, Mr Alan Greenspan returned to the beach, blowing his warning whistle
again.
The menace, of course, is higher inflation, not to mention the commitment of
the Federal Reserve chairman, as America's economic lifeguard, to contain
the danger by lifting interest rates whenever the central bank sees fit.
It seems the demise of uncertainty was greatly exaggerated in the run-up to
the Fed chief's appearance on Capitol Hill. 'What people want is certainty
and we can only be certain they are not going to find it,' says Mr Jim
Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer.
Mr Greenspan made sure of that in his semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins testimony
before the Senate and House banking committees. He told them that it was 'an
open question' whether inflationary pressures were still lurking below the
surface of the economy, despite the steady increase in interest rates since
February.
He left bond traders with the distinct impression that a fifth move to
tighter money supply this year could come at any time, though he stopped
well short of saying a rate increase was a foregone conclusion.
Most analysts now expect a tightening will coincide with the Fed's next
policy-making session on August 16.
After its July policy meeting, when the policy was left unchanged, bond
traders began to grow bolder in the conviction that the Fed had indeed
achieved Mr Greenspan's stated goal of moving to a 'neutral' policy stance,
one which would neither encourage or discourage expansion.
'The market wants to believe what has been profitable for a long time,
namely, that the economy will oblige by coming in weaker than expected,'
says Mr Grant. The big jump this spring in leveraged positions held by
primary government-bond dealers, from Dollars 147.4bn on March 20 to Dollars
169bn on June 22, shows the willingness of the market to throw caution to
the wind, he says.
Still, the perception that monetary policy was on hold was reinforced by
recent data. Business inventories in May showed their largest monthly
increase in seven years, the Commerce Department reported just a week ago,
suggesting a slowdown in industrial production in the second half of the
year.
With such evidence of a cooling economy in hand, Mr Greenspan had been
expected to confirm the market's rekindled hopes and pave the way for the
bulls' return.
Had traders revealed a touch of naivety? Nonsense, says Mr Robert Brusca, an
economist at Nikko Securities in New York. Only a week earlier, Mr Greenspan
himself had described the economy as enjoying the best of both worlds:
moderate growth and low inflation.
'People thought that after that description, we would hear a rather friendly
testimony last week, which did not turn out to be the case,' says the
analyst, who has been critical of what he describes as the chairman's 'ad
hoc' handling of monetary policy during the recession and afterwards. 'The
question now is, who is testifying: Dr Jekyll or Mr Greenspan,' Mr Brusca
quips.
Other analysts, however, contend that the market was ripe for a setback last
week, regardless of the tone and substance of the Fed chief's remarks.
Much of the buying in the brief rally that preceded his testimony came from
dealers covering 'short' positions, that is, replacing securities they had
borrowed and resold on speculation that prices would fall. Most retail
accounts stayed on the sidelines or confined their activity to the short end
of the maturity range.
Where does the market go from here? With Mr Greenspan's cautionary note,
bonds appear vulnerable. With all the short positions driven out, the most
likely direction is a downward drift until after the Fed's August 16
meeting.
Traders say an upturn is possible, but unlikely, if economic data over the
next month are perceived as causing the Fed policy-makers to delay the move
for which Mr Greenspan has laid the groundwork.
Mr Scott Knous, senior fixed-income analyst at Technical Data of Boston,
expects the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury to spend the next month
near 7.75 per cent, 25 basis points above the recent low of just under 7.50
per cent. He describes the overall tone as 'non-committal'.
But the market will not confine its perspective to the US economic
fundamentals. A further cut in German rates, a dollar rally and a fall in
commodity prices would prove supportive, traders say.
The market will need as much help as it can muster, with some Dollars 97bn
in fresh supply coming up for auction before the Fed session.
Not everyone is pessimistic about the outlook, even though the Treasury's
quarterly refunding operation falls in the middle of the summer doldrums. 'I
don't think the supply itself will be a problem if the market begins to get
some signal that will resolve some of these uncertainties,' says Thomas
Poor, manager of Scudder's Global Opportunities US Short-Term Income Fund.

The Bundesbank's application of the brakes on all three of its key interest
rates - completed last week with a fixed securities repurchase rate of 4.85
per cent for the duration of its four-week holiday - left plenty of options
open for the autumn.
Mr Gerhard Grebe, chief economist at Bank Julius Bar, suggested it also
presented a risk. In the case of another bout of dollar weakness,
intervention would be the only counter-measure at the bank's disposal, he
said.
That apart, the Bundesbank council left for its vacation in an unusually
comfortable situation.
Money supply is not half as bad as the bare figures suggest; inflation is
still on the down-track, and the economy is beginning to fire on more
cylinders.
If these conditions persist, the bank could resume its monetary easing at
any time after the break. While some are betting on further moves before the
October federal elections, there is also a school of thought which suggests
the Buba will wait until later. This would avoid any accusations of
political motivation, and give more time for M3 to settle down and the
bank's reputation to recover from its recent shaking.
On the other hand, as Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum hinted last week, the bank
could decide to sit pat and do nothing.

Japanese government bonds are expected to be trapped in a range this week as
technical factors are likely to prevent traders and investors from taking
large positions.
Although a spreading optimism over economic recovery and a rise in
short-term interest rates due to active fundraising by banks resulted in a
net loss in bond prices last week, the change in traded bond futures
contracts next month from the September to December contracts have prevented
a sell-off.
Meanwhile, cautiousness of over-supply still prevails, and market
participants will focus on a government offering, expected mid-week, of
Y1,000bn in 10-year bonds to test the real strength of the market.
In spite of previous concerns, last week's Y100bn Tokyo Electric Power
straight bond issue and Y100bn offering by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
were well received by investors. Traders, however, said the corporate issues
were priced attractively to draw buyers, and that it would be harder for
investors to absorb a large government issue.
Mr Katsuyuki Nawata, bond analyst at Sanwa Bank, says a coupon of around 4.4
per cent may attract institutional investors. He expects a range of 4.27 per
cent to 4.45 per cent on the yield for the No 164 bond as long as economic
data, released this week, do not betray market expectations.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Economics Notebook: Likelihood of SDR issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If anybody deserves a prize for persistence in global economic policy
making, it is Mr Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the
International Monetary Fund.
For as long as anyone can remember, he has been popping up at international
meetings to urge an issue of special drawing rights, the IMF's own reserve
asset.
He has prosecuted his campaign with a passion that contrasts starkly with
the apparent dryness of the subject. Now after many set-backs, Mr Camdessus'
hopes are high that he will win the backing of the Fund's 179 members for an
SDR issue at the IMF's annual meeting in Madrid in early October.
If he does, it will not be without a fight. For there is one institution
that cares as much as Mr Camdessus about the SDR. So far, the Bundesbank has
been implacable in its opposition to a general allocation of SDRs to all IMF
members to boost the world's monetary reserves.
But most of the Group of Seven large industrial countries now seem inclined
to give Mr Camdessus at least part of what he wants and will work for a
compromise in Madrid. In so doing, they will signal that the IMF should stay
in the business of providing financial support to countries with long-term
economic problems rather than focus on stability in the international
monetary system and short-term assistance to economies in difficulty, as
recommended by the recent report of the Bretton Woods Commission.
The special drawing right, or SDR, is a prime example of the IMF's talent
for cloaking its activities and achievements in bland phrases and obscure
acronyms.
It sounds boring: an artificial 'basket' currency, at present composed of
the dollar, D-Mark, yen, French franc and sterling and worth about Dollars
1.46. Yet when IMF members agree an SDR allocation they give the Fund the
power to create its own money.
IMF members agreed to establish SDRs in the late 1960s after years of
growing concern over a potential shortage of international liquidity and
fears that this would stifle global economic growth. SDRs were initially
issued to all IMF members in 1970 according to the size of their holdings in
the Fund. By 1972 they accounted for 8.4 per cent of world non-gold
reserves.
But early hopes that the SDR might supplant the dollar at the centre of the
world monetary system have faded. The last SDR issue was in 1981 and, as the
chart shows, its importance as a reserve asset has declined since.
The reluctance of IMF members to allow new SDRs has reflected the great
changes in the global economy since the early 1970s. Instead of dealing with
a liquidity shortage, policy makers soon had to contend with excess
liquidity caused by inflationary US financing of the Vietnam War.
Global capital markets have been liberalised over the past two decades
making it possible for most countries to supplement their reserves by
borrowing. Nor does global liquidity seem to be lacking at present. Many
monetary officials argue that the dollar's recent weakness has been a
symptom of excess liquidity rather than shortage.
But while the monetary case for an SDR allocation seems feeble, the
political reasons have strengthened. Communism has collapsed and the Cold
War has ended since the last SDR allocation in 1981. IMF membership
increased rapidly as former Soviet satellites and republics joined the Fund,
leaving nearly 40 IMF members without SDRs and raising a question of equity.
Against this background, Mr Camdessus has been campaigning for an allocation
of SDR36bn (about Dollars 52.5bn) to all Fund members. This, he says, would
help newcomers such as Russia and other former communist states, many of
which are starved of reserves. New SDRs would not be inflationary in today's
economic environment, he says.
Unfortunately, a general SDR increase would benefit wealthy industrialised
countries more than the disadvantaged. However, it would be easier to agree
than a selective SDR increase that would require a change in IMF rules and
the support of 85 per cent of the membership.
So far the US and other G7 countries have rejected his arguments. But the
prospect of helping Russia at no cost to itself has proven too tempting for
the US Treasury. At the recent Naples G7 summit, aides of Mr Lloyd Bentsen,
the US Treasury secretary, were touting the idea of a selective increase of
SDR4.5bn to satisfy the newcomers' desire for finance and salve the
industrial powers' conscience about unfair treatment.
However, no-one expects the long-standing developing country members of the
IMF to allow the newcomers to boost their reserves without obtaining
something for themselves. Almost certainly, there would have to be a general
SDR increase to win the necessary 85 per cent support for a selective SDR
increase.
Last week, Mr Bentsen admitted that a general SDR increase was discussed in
Naples. The way seems open for a compromise that would include a small
selective SDR allocation for new IMF members, a rather larger general issue
and, perhaps, increased access for countries in trouble to IMF resources
that are subject to economic policy conditions.
Mr Camdessus would then be able to enjoy a triumph in Madrid and declare
that the IMF has received a ringing endorsement from members in the 50th
anniversary year of the Bretton Woods agreement that created it.
The risk is that he will have established a precedent for unnecessary
liquidity expansion, weakening the IMF's counter inflationary credentials.

FT  25 JUL 94 / The Markets: Moment of truth for coffee - Commodities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coffee traders will have a better idea whether the price explosion in the
coffee market over the past month is justified after tomorrow. The Brazilian
government will then issue the first official assessment of the damage done
to its coffee crop by the frosts of two and four weeks ago.
Unofficial estimates have put the prospective 1995-96 crop (the first one
that will be affected) at between 10m and 15m bags (60kg each), compared
with the 25m forecast before the frosts. But most traders believe the lower
figure exaggerates the extent of the damage.
The September futures price on the London Commodity Exchange rose from
Dollars 2,255 to Dollars 4,085 a tonne as the frosts sparked off bouts of
near panic buying. It has since fallen back by Dollars 450 but traders have
been reluctant to push it any lower because further frosts will remain a
possibility until early September.
Nevertheless, a forecast above 15m bags tomorrow would be likely to push the
price down further.
Mr Claus de Freitas, the Brazilian National Coffee Department's director,
has given little away ahead of the report. Talking to the Reuter news agency
last Wednesday he played down comments by Mr Elcio Alvares, the industry and
commerce minister, that initial damage reports were exaggerated. 'There were
some reports that were exaggerated, not from the government, which is very
cautious, but from the minister's own sources,' Mr Freitas said. 'The
minister was saying that some people were saying that the whole country was
stricken. That did not happen.'
Refusing to comment further, he told reporters: 'The government cannot put
out a number that isn't right.'
Other events this week include an international rubber forum in Jakarta and
the Mining in Africa conference in Johannesburg, both on Wednesday, and the
publication of the International Wheat Council's latest grain crop estimates
on Thursday.

Socialist prime ministers don't usually provoke celebrations in bond
markets, and Japan's new leader is no exception.
Bond prices had already been under pressure for most of the year as the
market became caught up in global expectations of higher inflation. But now
the fixed interest market is under attack from the supply side, as investors
fear that the new coalition government is set to pump up a ballooning
deficit. Both fears are overdone.
Although Mr Tomiichi Murayama, heavily outgunned by his conservative
coalition partners, has abandoned most of the nostrums of socialist theology
in a few heady weeks, fiscal policy is another matter.
Ministers have been queuing up to promise a few trillion yen of extra
spending on everything from bullet trains to new houses, and with an
election likely in the next year, fiscal rectitude is not high on the
government's agenda. But the prospect of a few more public works projects
should not cause too much alarm - even the parsimonious bureaucrats at the
Ministry of Finance don't object to borrowing for the purpose of investing.
What really worries them and the bond market is the unresolved debate on
revenue. Late last year plans were laid for a Y6 trillion cut in income tax
to stimulate the economy. As with most Japanese fiscal stimuli, there was a
strong element of smoke and mirrors. The income tax cut was, if the MoF had
its way, to be offset by a huge hike in consumption tax - from its current 3
per cent to as high as 10 per cent. The socialists objected, and the income
tax cut alone was implemented.
That tax cut takes effect this month, and the MoF is back to demand its
pound of flesh. Its case is seductively simple. The past few years have seen
the government's finances dive into the red. From a surplus of 3 per cent of
GDP in 1991, the fiscal balance will have declined to a deficit of 1.5 per
cent this year. Hardly a case for alarm. But take out the surplus on the
social security fund and the deficit soars - to about 5.7 per cent of GDP.
But few people can be unaware that for the past three years Japan has been
experiencing its worst recession since the 1930s. Measurement of the output
gap - the difference between actual output and trend - is tricky because of
the tendency of Japan's rate of growth to slow over time, but a conservative
estimate would put it at around 6 to 7 per cent.
In other words, the Japanese economy has plenty of slack to make up, and
could grow at about 4 per cent a year for the next five years before running
into serious capacity constraints. Growth of that level would certainly
restore the fiscal balance to order.
But, says the MoF, that ignores the longer term weakness at the heart of the
public accounts - the unusual age structure of Japan's population - youthful
now, but greying rapidly into the next century, presaging a heavy pensions
burden on future governments. That, it says, requires a consumption tax
increase today to avert a debt crisis tomorrow.
But with the economy emerging slowly from a long recession, to impose a huge
tax increase now to deal with a problem that might arise in 2010 seems
masochistic. Surely better to let the recovery float the public finances
back into equilibrium - then decide what to do about the demographics
A consumption tax increase now might well choke off the hesitant recovery,
creating a short-term fiscal problem as well as along-term one.
Inflation
If fears of an excess supply of bonds are misplaced, weak demand is already
a reality. Investors have been fleeing bonds as global expectations of
inflation have spread to Japan. The yield on Japanese government bonds has
risen to 4.3 per cent from less than 3 per cent at the start of the year.
But it is hard to see how world inflation is going to get to Japan.
As noted above, the amount of slack in the economy is so great that there is
little or no prospect of a revival in output producing anything more than
the slightest of upticks in prices. Deregulation, moving admittedly at a
snail's pace, is proceeding nonetheless, and is bringing down prices. And
the rise in the yen's value is insulating the country from external price
shocks.
Core consumer price inflation has decelerated to below 1 per cent. But this
is only half the story. The figures seriously underweight purchases in the
rapidly growing discount sector. Anecdotal evidence suggests prices may be
falling by as much as 5 per cent a year.
Sustained deflation might itself create fiscal problems as the real value of
government debt rises. But the current public debt/GDP ratio, at 47 per
cent, is comfortably within the bounds of manageability. The attractions of
low inflation are more important to the bond market than the vague long term
dangers of oversupply.
Exporters
With the yen showing scant sign of coming back to earth, investors might be
tempted to dump equity in the major export sectors, such as transport,
electricals and precision instruments.
But this could be an error. New research by UBS Tokyo shows that, despite
the high yen, many firms raised exports last year, and they can be expected
to do so again.
The explanation, according to Neil Rogers, a UBS equity strategist, lies in
the real, as distinct from the nominal exchange rate. With the exception of
Europe the major export markets for Japanese companies have been growing
strongly. At the same time inflation is much higher in all of them than in
Japan.
In the major Asian economies, consensus forecasts suggest growth should
average over 8 per cent this year, with inflation above 9 per cent. Even in
the United States, growth this year of 3.5 per cent could be accompanied by
inflation of 3 per cent.
With prices and costs in Japan falling, the real appreciation of the yen is
much lower than the nominal figure. And the large increases in demand mean
companies should be able to remain competitive, either by raising prices and
retaining market share, or by cutting margins and seeing market share grow.
Meanwhile the deflation in Japan that is keeping the country's goods
competitive is likely to depress profits for those companies locked into the
home market. The high yen may not help exporters, but neither is it likely
to depress their competitiveness vis-a-vis industry as a whole.

FT  25 JUL 94 / International Company News: Slowdown at Quaker Oats but
Kellogg ahead despite tax rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Quaker Oats warned of a profit standstill but Kellogg reported a 6 per cent
increase in net income in separate announcements from the two US breakfast
cereal manufacturers.
Chicago-based Quaker Oats, recently the subject of bid speculation, said
earnings in the fourth quarter to June would be 'about even' with the
Dollars 1.30 of last year's comparable period, even ignoring the effect of a
previously-announced restructuring charge.
The company blamed the slowdown on disappointing sales in Europe, resulting
from poor economic conditions, and the effects of hyperinflation on its
Brazilian business.
Quaker Oats said that its US businesses were doing well, with higher overall
volume coming from its Gatorade sports drink and cereal products.
It said it expected to report higher profits and earnings per share for the
full year, excluding the restructuring charge.
In May, the company said it would be taking a pre-tax charge of between
Dollars 110m and Dollars 130m in the fourth quarter to cover the cost of
consolidating some of its US and international operations and reducing
employment.
Kellogg reported a 14 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Dollars 245.5m
for the second quarter to June, but a higher tax charge reduced the increase
to 6 per cent at the after-tax level. Net income rose from Dollars 142.7m to
Dollars 151.5m.
Sales rose by nearly 5 per cent to Dollars 1.62bn and earnings per share by
nearly 10 per cent to 68 cents, reflecting stock repurchases. For the first
six months, net income was 4 per cent ahead at Dollars 335.4m.
Kellogg said operational improvements and cost-cutting boosted the results.
The company has lost market share in the US over the past few years and this
month replaced the head of its North American ready-to-eat cereal business.

FT  25 JUL 94 / International Company News: Sale by BCH raises Pta55bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banco Central Hispano (BCH), the large Spanish bank which has been squeezed
by narrowed financial margins, has raised Pta55bn (Dollars 423m) through the
sale of an 18 per cent stake in Cepsa, the domestic petrol refiner and
distributor. BCH did not name the buyer but it is understood to be SMM
Company, an international fund managed by Morgan Grenfell.
BCH said the proceeds from the disposal would be injected into its core
banking business and would help to increase its net interest income.
The disposal reduces BCH's holding in Cepsa by half to 18 per cent but under
the terms of the sale, it retains the full voting rights of its former 36
per cent holding. Cepsa's other main shareholders are the French
Elf-Aquitaine group, with 33 per cent, and IPIC of Abu Dhabi, with 10 per
cent.
The sale forms part of the bank's strategic plan to slim its industrial
portfolio to release funds that will underpin its flagging profit margins.
Although BCH has the largest volume of total assets in the domestic banking
sector, and also the largest branch network, its return on assets is well
below that rival groups.
The bank's net interest income shrunk by 4.8 per cent last year, although
operating profit was up by 11.8 per cent due, in part, to mostly
non-recurring foreign exchange and debt trading income. BCH is steeling
itself for a sharp drop in treasury-based profits this year and posted
disappointing first-quarter results with an 11.8 per cent fall in net
attributable profit .
BCH, which was advised by J. P. Morgan of the US in its Cepsa disposal,
earned Pta3,425 per share for its equity in the refiner, a price that was
considered good for the bank by analysts.

FT  25 JUL 94 / International Company News: Chairman of Lac Minerals steps
down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A shareholder revolt has forced Mr Peter Allen to step down as chairman and
chief executive of Lac Minerals, the Canadian gold and base metals producer
which is in the throes of fighting a hostile takeover bid.
Mr Allen had become a lightning rod for shareholders' dissatisfaction since
Royal Oak Mines, a much smaller but more aggressive Vancouver gold producer,
came forward with a CDollars 1.4bn (USDollars 1.01bn) takeover offer this
month.
The rationale behind Royal Oak's bid was that Lac, which has mines in
Canada, the US and Chile, was not realising its full potential under
existing management.
Mr Allen's departure throws another obstacle in front of Royal Oak, whose
bid, consisting largely of its own shares, was already considered a long
shot.
Lac shares are expected to rise sharply on the Toronto stock exchange today.
They climbed by 37 cents to CDollars 13.38 on Friday before Mr Allen's
resignation was announced.
The shares are widely held, mainly by US and Canadian institutions. Many
have made their displeasure with management known in recent weeks by
tentatively tendering their shares to Royal Oak.
Mr Allen, aged 54, said: 'I have listened very carefully to Lac's
shareholders and their concerns about management. I am not prepared to let
personalities define this takeover fight and distract from the fundamental
economic issues at stake.'
Mr Jim Pitblado, a non-executive director and former head of Canada's
biggest securities firm, will take over as Lac chairman and acting chief
executive officer.
Mr Pitblado said the board would prefer Lac to remain an independent,
widely-traded Canadian company. He plans to present that case to
shareholders this week.
However, he said the board would keep its options open should another bid
materialise.

FT  25 JUL 94 / International Company News: Foreign exchange losses limit
increase at Telmex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Telefonos de Mexico, Mexico's largest private company, reported net profits
of 4.39bn pesos (Dollars 1.29bn) for the first half of 1994, a reduction in
real terms of 0.7 per cent over the same period last year.
Telmex profits were adversely affected by the rise in interest rates and
weakness of the peso, which caused the company to report losses on its
foreign exchange dealings. Without the exchange loss, profits would have
increased by 15.8 per cent in real terms, excluding tax adjustments.
Second-quarter profits grew by 12.8 per cent compared with the same period
last year, with exchange losses lower than expected at 186m pesos. The
result was better than most forecasts and Telmex stock posted gains on the
stock market.
Operating profits rose by 12.6 per cent in the first half to 6.04bn pesos,
and sales by 12.2 per cent to 13.84bn pesos. Revenues from domestic services
grew by 19.4 per cent to 6.35bn pesos, while national long-distance revenues
increased by a more modest 1.8 per cent to 4.29bn pesos, after a cut in
long-distance tariffs.
'We are starting to see evidence of a re-balancing between local and
long-distance revenues,' said Mr Ricardo Peon, an analyst with Baring
Securities.
The company says it is going to face competition in its long-distance market
from 1997, and in preparation is seeking to make itself less dependent on
long-distance revenues.
Telmex reported further progress in its efforts to expand Mexico's telephone
system, with lines in service increasing to 7.996m, up 12.9 per cent
compared with June 1993.

FT  25 JUL 94 / International Company News: Rodier to take helm at Pechiney
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jean-Pierre Rodier, a 47-year-old board member of the Franco-Belgian
Union Miniere, is likely next week to become president of Pechiney, the
French state-controlled aluminium and packaging group.
Mr Rodier, named to the board of Pechiney by decree on Saturday, is expected
to be endorsed at next week's cabinet meeting as the group's president. He
will replace Mr Jean Gandois, Pechiney's long-serving president who has
resigned in a bid to become the head of the Patronat employers federation
later this year.
The government chose Mr Rodier over several more senior candidates, because
of his experience, with Union Miniere since 1991 and before that with
Metaleurop, in the volatile non-ferrous metals industry. His main challenge
will be to prepare for the privatisation of Pechiney, which last year lost
FFr980m (Dollars 180m) on falling sales but hopes to break even this year
with the recent firming in the world price of aluminium, which had been hit
by cheap Russian supplies.
The government's political dilemma with Pechiney, which is on the list of 21
state-owned companies for sale, is that if the group were to abandon
aluminium in favour of concentrating on its more profitable packaging
activities, its centre of gravity would shift to the US, where in 1989 it
bought American National Can.
The government has also been considering giving Pechiney a steady source of
cash by letting it take over Compagnie Nationale du Rhone, which manages a
series of hydro-electric dams on the Rhone. But this plan has run into
opposition from local politicians and from Electricite de France, France's
monopoly distributor of electricity, and would require fresh legislation.

Manitou BF Group, the world's largest producer of rough-terrain lift trucks,
is expanding into Germany by buying the wheeled loader division of Ahlmann
Maschinenbau, the medium-sized German construction equipment producer.
The deal, for which terms were not disclosed, is an important move for
Manitou, which is quoted on the French second market and had group turnover
and net profits of FFr1.25bn (Dollars 230m) and FFr42.1m respectively last
year.
The takeover will give Manitou additional turnover of FFr300m a year.

FT  25 JUL 94 / International Company News: Weak quarter for Bankers Trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bankers Trust has seen a sharp fall in its income from selling derivatives
to companies and others in recent months, in the wake of losses reported by
some of its customers.
The bank, which has been the leader in using derivatives to devise
risk-management products for companies and investors, attracted considerable
adverse publicity when Procter &amp; Gamble said it had lost Dollars 157m on
financial instruments bought from the bank. The company added at the time
that it was considering suing Bankers Trust over the loss.
The New York-based bank said profits from what it calls 'client financial
risk management' dropped to Dollars 50m in the three months to the end of
June, down from Dollars 114m in the previous three months, as revenues in
the area fell by a third. During 1993, profits averaged Dollars 84m a
quarter.
Mr Tim Yates, chief financial officer, said the bank believed its share of
the risk-management business had remained stable during the period. The
decline reflected an overall fall-off in the use of derivatives,
particularly more complex instruments which carry higher profit margins.
Meanwhile, Bankers Trust failed to record the sort of rebound in profits
from trading in financial markets that many analysts had expected.
During the first three months of the year, it earned revenues of only
Dollars 14m from trading, and reported a loss in the area of Dollars 49m.
In the second quarter, revenues rose to Dollars 124m, while profits reached
Dollars 52m - still well behind the Dollars 405m revenues of a year before.
The bank added that a significant part of the trading profits in the latest
quarter stemmed from the recent Brazilian debt restructuring and its
holdings of Brazilian bonds.
Mr Yates declined to disclose how much Bankers Trust had earned from this
single event, or even whether it would have showed a trading profit without
the Brazilian debt restructuring.
Bankers Trust blamed the weak trading figures - which echoed trading figures
published by other US banks in recent days - on poor conditions in the
financial markets. 'Pure proprietary trading, while it has improved from the
first quarter, is still in a difficult environment,' Mr Yates said.
Overall, the bank's after-tax profits for the second quarter fell by 28 per
cent to Dollars 181m, or Dollars 2.09 a share, from Dollars 251m, or Dollars
2.90, the year before.
Half-year net income was Dollars 345m, or Dollars 3.99, compared with
Dollars 481m, or Dollars 5.54, in the first six months of 1993.

FT  25 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Sainsbury expected to bid for Wm Low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J Sainsbury is expected to join battle with rival Tesco this week by
launching a counterbid for Wm Low, the Scottish supermarket group.
Sainsbury has been examining the detailed financial information on Wm Low it
had requested and although it is thought that it has not yet made a final
decision it is widely expected that it will top Tesco's 225p a share bid.
By the end of last week Low's shares had climbed to 265p as the City decided
a move by Sainsbury was almost certain. The shares jumped 67p to 236p when
Tesco launched its bid on July 14.
Rival supermarket chains also expect Sainsbury to overcome its historic
aversion towards hostile takeover bids. 'Sainsbury cannot afford to sit back
and let Tesco steal a march on it in Scotland. There is only one Wm Low,'
said an adviser to one of its competitors.
Sainsbury itself would only say: 'We are studying the information supplied
by Wm Low and will make another announcement in due course.'
Both Sainsbury and Tesco are keen to expand in Scotland where they have only
5 per cent and 7 per cent of the market respectively.
Wm Low has almost 7 per cent with its 45 outlets and has a further 12 stores
in the north of England.
Sainsbury, which has only four outlets north of the border, has found it
difficult to expand with planning rules making it hard to find greenfield
sites and competitors bidding up the price of available land.
Its most northerly distribution centre is outside Manchester and taking over
Wm Low would give it a ready-made infrastructure.
However, fewer than half Wm Low's stores are thought to be appropriate for
the Sainsbury format and the company is likely to be estimating the price it
could get for the others.

FT  25 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Hillsdown facing pensions probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Pensions Ombudsman is investigating complaints about the treatment of a
group of pensioners by Hillsdown Holdings, the food manufacturer.
More than 40 former employees of FMC, a meat processing company acquired by
Hillsdown in 1983, have voiced complaints that they were treated unfairly
when a surplus from their pension fund was repaid to Hillsdown.
Hillsdown transferred the FMC scheme's assets, totalling about Pounds 35m,
to another Hillsdown fund in 1989, which subsequently repaid Pounds 18.4m,
predominantly from the FMC surplus, to Hillsdown over the next two years.
The pensioners say that Hillsdown was unfair in that it gave them minimal
increases in their benefits, in return for the transfer of their scheme's
assets.
They also argue that there may have been a breach of the FMC trust deed,
which said that any surplus not retained should mainly be used to increase
benefits.
Hillsdown says that it believes, on the strength of independent advice, that
the transfer of the surplus was legal. It also says that it paid a suitable
package of improved benefits to the scheme's members.
The complaints were initially investigated by the Occupational Pensions
Advisory Services, which passed the matter to the Pensions Ombudsman last
November.
The courts have the power to enforce decisions made by the Ombudsman, who is
expected to reach a conclusion on the matter shortly.

FT  25 JUL 94 / UK Company News: SE completes Warburg inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Stock Exchange has completed a preliminary investigation into SG
Warburg's handling of the purchase of Lasmo shares during the bid from
Enterprise Oil.
In the final days of the bid Warburg spent Pounds 170m on behalf of
Enterprise buying a 10 per cent stake in Lasmo from institutions.
The purchase, at a large premium to the current market price, brought
complaints from other shareholders who said they were not given the chance
to sell.
Swiss Bank Corporation complained to the Stock Exchange that it had a sell
order placed with Warburg which was ignored when the purchases were carried
out.
Warburg has argued that Swiss Bank did not have a valid buying order and
that the dispute concerns a technical issue of little significance.
The Stock Exchange confirmed that the panel formed to look into the
complaint had 'reached a preliminary view which is now being discussed with
the parties concerned'.
The stock market raid was carried out in an unusual manner and caused great
ill-feeling among those institutions not favoured. Some pointed to the fact
that most of the institutions whose shares were bought accepted Enterprise's
paper offer for the remainder of their holding.
It would be against the Takeover Code for a bidder to offer cash to some
shareholders on the understanding they would subsequently accept the offer.
But some observers believe the fact that most of the favoured institutions
accepted the bid shows only that Warburg misjudged the mood of institutions.
It would have been more effective to buy shares off investors who planned to
reject the offer.
Independent experts believe the Swiss Bank complaint concerns a 'grey area'
in the Stock Exchange's rules and question whether the outcome of the
investigation will have much effect on Warburg's reputation.

FT  25 JUL 94 / International Company News: Property Trust in Pounds 12m
Chinese joint venture deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Property Trust, of which the Cheng family of Hong Kong holds a stake of more
than 45 per cent, plans to acquire a one third interest in a property joint
venture in Guangzhou, China, in a deal worth Pounds 12m.
The group plans to establish a new holding company in Bermuda which will
take over the existing UK property portfolio as well as purchase the joint
venture stake.
Shareholders are being asked to exchange one share in Property Trust for one
new share in the Bermuda-based company, Property Trust Holdings.
The stake in the 182,000 sq m mixed development, Dong Xiao Garden Plaza, is
to be acquired by the issue of B shares from Property Trust Holdings.
The net assets of the enlarged group following the acquisition are expected
to amount to about Pounds 21.7m, according to Mr Anthony Cheng, chairman.
Property Trust's shares were suspended pending shareholder and court
approval of the arrangements. The company also announced that pre-tax
profits for the year to end-March had fallen from Pounds 626,000 to Pounds
450,000. It said the previous year's profits had benefited from property
sales.

FT  25 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Insurers plan rival to direct dealing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A group of independent insurance brokers is planning to fight back against
the increasing dominance of direct dealers such as Direct Line, by setting
up a cost efficient insurance company to take on their direct rivals.
The project has been launched by the Institute of Insurance Brokers, which
represents about 1,100 members, generally small independent brokers, and
will be giving a presentation to launch the new company in September.
Mr Andrew Paddick, the IIB's director general, said a leading team of
industry specialists had already laid down the blueprint for the company and
developed software designs, and it would be in a position to launch by June
1 next year.
The project is contingent on getting financial backing from brokers and
possibly outside insurance companies to cover the set-up costs of 'several
million pounds' and the more substantial underwriting reserves.
In addition, it will have to fight concerns over independent insurance
brokers selling through a captive company, which could be open to abuse.
However, there is no doubt that the brokers are under pressure to stem the
tide of losses from one of their staple sources of business.
The new insurance company will have a minimal staff and no advertising fees
since it will be marketed and sold by the brokers, who will be able to lock
directly into the system.
Mr Paddick said it would be able to offer premiums which at least matched
the direct insurers.
The direct insurers will hold the cost advantage of having no brokerage
commissions, but this will be partly offset by their higher marketing and
sales costs.
It will be a challenging fight. Direct Line was formed in 1985 but has
already become the UK's largest insurer with 1.6m motor policies.

FT  25 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Lazard plans to launch Indian trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lazard Brothers is planning to launch a London-listed Indian investment
trust in alliance with the BK Birla industrial group and Creditcapital
Finance Corporation, the Indian merchant bank in which Lazard has a 40 per
cent stake.
The Lazard Birla fund will aim to raise about Pounds 100m from retail and
institutional investors this autumn. The UK's first Indian investment trust,
launched earlier this year by Fleming Investment Trust Management, attracted
Pounds 84m.
BK Birla is one of India's largest industrial groups, and has interests in
many sectors but has not previously been associated with fund management. Mr
Adrian Collins, a Lazard director, said Birla's contribution to the fund
would be advice based on its depth of knowledge of Indian companies, and
understanding of the nature of business in India.
Investments will be made in a wide range of Indian equities, with a probable
slight bias towards medium-sized and smaller companies.
A Lazard team has been working on the project for nine months, and believes
it has now resolved the tax complications for foreigners investing in India,
which has a favourable tax treaty only with Mauritius. Fleming's India fund
developed a structure which invested via Mauritius.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Standard Chartered submits to HK inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Standard Chartered, the UK-based international banking group, is
co-operating with an independent investigation in Hong Kong into alleged
malpractice in its bullion dealing arm.
The bank is understood to be forwarding information from an internal inquiry
into allegations of corruption and bribery to the Independent Commission
Against Corruption, an independent anti-corruption body with police powers,
in order to reassure banking regulators in the UK colony.
Standard said its investigation into allegations that employees of Mocatta,
its bullion division, used false expenses claims to finance bribes for
officials in Malaysia and the Philippines was continuing, although the
Malaysian end had been completed.
'We are continuing our investigation, and keeping all the regulatory
authorities involved informed on a regular basis,' said the bank. The
investigation would carry on for 'as long as it takes' to sort out the
issue. Standard could not confirm the involvement of the anti-corruption
commission, but it emphasised that it had started its inquiry after a review
of controls within Mocatta.
Mr John McFarlane, the Standard Chartered director who has taken charge of
Mocatta within a new division, said last week that the bank had told
managers that it would not tolerate repetitions of similar behaviour.
The Mocatta allegations follow the bank's suspension from new issue activity
in the colony until next April because of the involvement of its securities
arm in share price support schemes in a series of company flotations.
The bank said last week that it had completed an inquiry in Malaysia into
the disappearance of a Dollars 10,000 gold coin, which was given to a former
Malaysian deputy finance minister as a 'sample' and disappeared after he
passed it on to a consultant. Mr Stephen Goh, the consultant, recompensed
the bank after he mislaid the coin.
Standard said yesterday that it had delayed its planned secondary listings
in Hong Kong and Singapore because of unfavourable market conditions.
It said the decision was not connected with the Mocatta investigation.

FT  25 JUL 94 / US to take action on stock options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US companies are almost certain to be forced to take the costs of stock
options as a charge against profits within the next three years, under
proposals being considered by the US Financial Accounting Standards Board.
Companies will also be required by the end of this year to provide
substantial additional details on their use of financial derivatives such as
swaps and currency hedging instruments, under a separate accounting standard
due out in October.
The standard will require companies to disclose their accounting policies on
derivatives, the quantitative effects of these instruments and what they
hope to achieve by their use.
Mr Dennis Beresford, chairman of the board, was confident a solution could
be found to concerns about how to measure reliably the cost of options, the
shares awarded to compensate senior executives. Options are widely seen as a
form of remuneration which have a cost to shareholders.
Mr Beresford's determination comes in spite of protest from companies,
Congress and accountancy firms that the proposals will impair financial
performance.
Members of FASB are considering about 10 approaches to valuing options after
their previous approach was attacked for allocating them too high a cost.
However, Mr Beresford said the techniques developed were no less accurate
than those used for other uncertain areas in accounting which are already
charged as costs, such as provisions for bad debts or valuation of
obsolescent stock.
The revised FASB stock option proposals are unlikely to be circulated until
the first quarter of next year and may still be delayed for further
consultation.
The original proposals allowed three years for additional disclosure before
forcing companies to take the costs of the options as a charge. Mr Beresford
said the revised plans might compress this intermediate period into two
years, so that companies would still be required to show the cost of options
in their profit and loss accounts for fiscal year-ends from 1997.
Derivatives have come under increasing scrutiny over the past few months
following a series of occasions involving their mismanagement.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Company News (This Week): A brighter hue despite patchy
paint finish - ICI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Imperial Chemical Industries, the UK's biggest chemicals group, reports
second-quarter results on Thursday, with estimates ranging from Pounds 110m
to Pounds 130m against Pounds 96m for the same period last year.
Most observers are bullish about prospects. ICI is benefiting from its
exposure to the buoyant US and Asian markets, and the recovery in the UK.
The only fly in the ointment is continental Europe, but US groups that have
already reported second-quarter results have noted some upturn in demand
there. Bayer, the German group, also issued bullish forecasts this month.
The continuing improvement in demand will mainly help the industrial
chemicals division and regional businesses. Prices for some of ICI's
important products - such as PVC, titanium dioxide and PET - have been
rising strongly in recent months. Brokers Kleinwort Benson expect the
industrial division to post operating profits of Pounds 35m to Pounds 54m,
with the regional businesses registering about Pounds 15m.
Analysts will be listening out for chairman Sir Denys Henderson's comments
about whether the upturn is driven mainly by rising demand. Another
explanation is that the recent strong growth has partly been the consequence
of stock-building, with customers buying supplies in advance of possible
price rises.
The only business that could report lower operating profits is the paint
division. Brokers Kleinwort Benson are expecting flat results at Pounds 32m,
but James Capel is predicting a fall year on year, because of a squeeze on
prices in the UK decorative market. Raw material prices, essentially
pigments, have also been rising, putting pressure on margins.
Most analysts expect the interim dividend to remain unchanged at 10.5p.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Heir steps in to take the encore: Richard Waters reports on
how Wells Fargo, the US bank, plans to sustain growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Carl Reichardt has decided to quit while he is ahead. The 63-year-old
Texan heads what is generally regarded as one of the best-run big US
commercial banks, with stock market ratings to match.
Driven by falling costs and expansion into mutual funds and other investment
products, Wells Fargo's shares have jumped from under Dollars 15 when Mr
Reichardt took over to more than Dollars 150. They are now trading at nearly
2.3 times the bank's book value, and a multiple of 10.5 times this year's
projected earnings. The question now is, what can it do for an encore?
Mr Reichardt announced last Tuesday that he will retire at the end of this
year, after 12 years as the bank's chairman and chief executive. The move
clears the way for Mr Paul Hazen to take over. Currently the bank's
president, 54-year-old Mr Hazen has already served as Mr Reichardt's number
two for a decade.
Mr Reichardt and Mr Hazen flew to Philadelphia two weeks ago to break the
news to Mr Warren Buffet, the US investor who is Wells Fargo's biggest
shareholder. 'He doesn't think people should retire - ever,' Mr Reichardt
said.
Mr Buffett's close interest in who is at the helm of the San Francisco-based
bank is understandable. He bought 10 per cent of Wells Fargo's shares in
1990 for around Dollars 290m (Pounds 187m), and has since taken his stake to
12.6 per cent - a holding worth slightly more than Dollars 1bn. Mr Buffett
last week declared himself 'more than comfortable with the new leadership'.
Mr Hazen indicated that he intended to continue with the formula that made
his double-act with Mr Reichardt a success. 'There's a lot of growth still
in the basic businesses,' he said. The next two to three years will be spent
increasing Wells Fargo's market share with a number of products: he singles
out car leasing, investment products and consumer lending.
He also talks of expanding Wells Fargo's commercial property lending again.
Despite the market downturn at the end of the 1980s, 'when you look at it
over a whole cycle, returns were extraordinary', he says.
Heavy commercial property lending was nearly the death of Wells Fargo. Its
Dollars 13bn of loans at the end of 1990, against shareholders' funds of
Dollars 3.4bn, made it the most exposed big bank in the country to the
property downturn (its share price halved, to around Dollars 40, in a matter
of weeks during the summer of 1990).
Unlike many others, it did not rush to liquidate loans. Many of the assets
recorded as non-performing today yield around 8.5 per cent in cash. 'That's
a hell of a non-performing portfolio.'
According to Mr Reichardt, over the past six months Wells Fargo has begun
'buying portfolios - we have been actively looking at troubled loans'.
Internal rates of return on these investments are in the range of 20-30 per
cent, he says.
Meanwhile, Wells Fargo seems unlikely in the near future to take any of the
radical steps being considered last year: a big bank merger, for example, or
a move to give up its status as a bank holding company altogether.
Many US bank chairmen talk whimsically of dropping their bank charters: it
would liberate them from the costs of the federal deposit and insurance fund
and the equal lending provisions that, bankers claim, put them at a
disadvantage to non-bank rivals. It also 'gives the holding company greater
flexibility in its activities, as well greater flexibility in who can own
it', said Mr Hazen.
Wells Fargo got further than most in debating the issue. However, the
alternative that it considered - becoming a savings and loan institution -
would have brought its own limitations, principally in the form of a
restriction on the bank's ability to make commercial loans. Despite this,
the issue of whether to give up being a bank 'is still one we might look at
from time to time', Mr Hazen says.
Nor does Wells Fargo seem likely to become involved soon in a big takeover
or merger. Mr Reichardt talks with regret of his failure to persuade First
Interstate, the bank's Los Angeles-based neighbour, to agree to a merger
last year.
He adds: 'I think that from a theoretical standpoint, putting together two
large branch systems like this . . . and being able to take out Dollars
400m-Dollars 500m expenses a year is a sensible business proposition.'
With Dollars 54bn in assets against Wells Fargo's Dollars 52bn and an
extensive branch system in the western US First Interstate would have
provided a springboard for the bank to mount a stronger challenge to
BankAmerica, the giant West Coast bank created by the merger with Security
Pacific two years ago.
Jilted by First Interstate, Mr Reichardt now talks of spending the bank's
money on buying its own shares instead. With a tier one capital ratio of
10.1 per cent, Wells Fargo is well endowed with capital.
The bank has just approved purchases of up to 10 per cent of its own shares
(though it has set no timetable for the exercise) at a cost of around
Dollars 800m at the current share price.
The buy-back programme will help to support the bank's earnings per share in
the short term. But it does not answer the bigger question of how Wells
Fargo can maintain the earnings growth that made Mr Reichardt, according to
Forbes magazine, 'Warren Buffett's favourite banker.'

FT  25 JUL 94 / Company News (This Week): Kopper must walk critical
tightrope - Deutsche Bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Hilmar Kopper, Deutsche Bank's irascible chairman, will be choosing his
words carefully when he opens the German banking sector's half-year
reporting season at a press conference tomorrow. He has been advised that it
is time to start refurbishing Deutsche Bank's public image after the
calamities of the recent past, including the near collapse of
Metallgesellschaft and the Schneider property affair.
While more mishaps cannot be ruled out, and DM500m (Pounds 206.6m) has
already been set aside to cover Schneider losses, the bank's recent
statements that it expects 1994 provisioning for bad and doubtful debts to
fall from last year's DM3.3bn seem confident enough.
Operating profits after provisions were down 10 per cent after four months,
but there is increasing confidence among investors and analysts that some of
the ground will be made up by the end of the year.
The main reason is an expected drop in own-account earnings from last year's
bumper DM2bn. But improved commission income and better interest margins
should provide some compensation.
Deutsche's substantial stakes in corporations such as Daimler-Benz are seen
as having big recovery potential. Other attractions include hints that
Germany's biggest credit institution will celebrate its 125th birthday next
year with a handsome dividend bonus.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Brussels reins in plans for more EU job laws: Emphasis on
consolidation will please UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission will this week agree to rein in the launch of
further initiatives in EU-wide employment law, in an approach that will find
favour with the UK government.
Instead of pushing ahead with fresh directives, new emphasis will be placed
on ensuring proper implementation of what has already been passed.
This is one of the central planks of the European Union white paper on
social policy, drawn up by Mr Padraig Flynn, social affairs commissioner,
and due to be endorsed by the Commission on Wednesday.
'A lot of progress has been made over the past 18 months and we do not think
it is relevant to come forward with a new legislative agenda,' said one of
Mr Flynn's senior aides at the weekend.
The UK has been the most hostile of the 12 EU states to the growth of
European employment legislation, such as the recent directives regulating
working time and young people at work.
The UK government will, however, welcome a new initiative to create greater
mobility for workers within the EU. The white paper is expected to recommend
creation of a high-level European Commission working party, with the aim of
breaking down continuing barriers to mobility, especially in occupational
pensions.
On the implementation of employment legislation, where the UK has a good
record, special emphasis will be placed on encouraging southern European
countries, such as Greece, to put into practice health and safety
legislation already approved at EU level.
The UK government will not, however, support everything in the white paper.
The Commission is expected to emphasise that if no agreement can be reached
by the end of the year on key employment directives, such as that on the
rights of part-time workers, negotiations will be transferred from the
political level to EU trade union and employer groups.
The current German presidency of the EU is eager to reach an EU-wide deal
giving part-time workers equal rights, and even equal pay on a pro rata
basis, as part of its campaign to boost part-time employment in Germany.
But the UK government is almost certain to block an agreement, which would
open up the possibility that the issue will be dealt with by the 11 other EU
states in their 'social protocol'.
Other points that the social policy white paper is expected to raise
include:
EU-wide legislation outlawing race discrimination. Although all individual
states have such legislation, those who have been the victims of
discrimination while travelling from one state to another have found it
difficult to get justice.
An action programme on equality between the sexes, concentrating on making
it easier to share child-rearing duties through provisions such as career
breaks and part-time work. Greater convergence of social security systems.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Texaco refinery blaze cuts 10% of UK capacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A fire was still blazing at Texaco's Milford Haven oil refinery in west
Wales last night following an explosion that will cut 10 per cent of the
UK's refining capacity for an indefinite period.
The company said last night that it was too soon to assess the extent of the
damage or estimate how long it would take to restore production. However,
industry experts said that even prolonged closure would have minimal impact
on prices.
The blast, which occured at 1.30pm, broke windows in the town of Milford
Haven two miles away and was followed by a fierce blaze that took 150
firefighters several hours to bring under control. By early evening the fire
was being allowed to burn itself out, and fire crews were expected to remain
at the scene throughout the night.
Dyfed Fire Brigade reported a leak of inflammable butane gas but a Texaco
spokesman, Mr Phil Thompson said he had no information about a leak.
Shortly after 10pm, Dyfed's Chief Fire Officer, Mr Ronnie King, leading the
operation, said crews had been pulled back after a violent flare-up of an
oil product still left in the area.
There were no fatalities or serious injuries, but 26 Texaco workers were
treated for minor cuts and grazes.
The incident was classified as category 3, the most serious, but the company
said there was minimal risk of pollution because of the refinery's
anti-spill systems.
Carmarthen Fire Brigade said the fire caused further explosions. 'There were
two explosions originally which caused severe damage to three sections of
the plant and the explosions continued,' said a spokesman.
It was unclear whether the blast was related to an earlier fire in some
scaffolding planks near a crude distillation column which was caused by
lightning. 'That fire was extinguished very quickly but it put out some
instrumentation and the refinery was put on to tick-over mode,' said Texaco.
The neighbouring Gulf and Elf refineries also had small fires after a
thunderstorm on Saturday night but suffered no serious damage.
The main explosion, which was heard ten miles away, is thought to have
occurred in one of the process units near the centre of the refinery and
although the subsequent fire spread it remained well away from the storage
tanks.
The 550 acre site, opened in 1964, is Texaco's only refinery in the UK, with
capacity for 180,000 barrels of crude a day. Half is taken up by petrol -
about 3.5m gallons a day. It is the UK's second biggest refinery after BP's
Grangemouth plant and earlier this year celebrated 1m hours of operations
without an incident.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Fewer companies at risk of collapse as recovery picks up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The financial health of British companies improved sharply in the second
quarter of this year as the economic recovery took hold, according to a
study published today.
The analysis of 360,000 UK companies contributing more than 75 per cent of
Britain's gross domestic product finds a marked reduction in the number
considered to be in a risky condition or in significant danger of
collapsing.
It is further confirmation that the recovery is gathering pace. Figures last
week showed that the GDP was 3.3 per cent higher in the second quarter than
in the same period of 1993 - the first time since 1989 that growth exceeded
3 per cent.
The analysis, published by the broker Barclays De Zoete Wedd using figures
from the Dun &amp; Bradstreet corporate database, shows that Pounds 6bn of bank
debt moved out of the high risk category during the first half of the year.
The upturn in credit quality was particularly marked in the south-east,
south-west and East Anglia. Property and transport companies improved most
strongly among industrial sectors, with manufacturing companies also
stabilising.
The study follows optimistic statements from the chairmen of Barclays and
National Westminster bank about improvements in bad debt provisions, and BZW
will today raise its forecast for banks' earnings this year by a total of
Pounds 385m.
The fall in the number of companies rated as significantly risky for banks
to lend to is the first marked improvement in credit quality noted since the
end of the recession, although quality has risen slowly since the end of
last year.
Mr Hugh Pye, banks analyst at BZW, said the figures showed a 'dramatic'
improvement in credit quality. He said the ratings emphasised cash flow, and
companies appeared to be benefiting from lower interest rates.
The improvement in credit quality could help banks to feel more confident
about lending money. Banks have reported only gradual increases in loan
volumes during the recovery, partly because of a perceived lack of
high-quality borrowers.
The report says the upturn in credit quality in the south-east is
significant, since the region contains 40 per cent of all UK companies by
number, as well as 49 per cent of all companies with a poor credit rating.
The regions with the best corporate credit quality are in the north of
England - with 13.5 per cent of companies in a poor condition. This compares
with 17.3 per cent in the UK as a whole.

FT  25 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Bass
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is only a straw in the wind at the moment but the pace of discounting in
the UK beer trade seems to be abating. While the big brewers continue to
fight fiercely over the large national accounts, they have become less keen
to offer wholesale discounts to their smaller customers. Such a development
is only logical. It was clear from Bass's interim profits in May that
discounting had failed to produce the required reward in terms of volume.
Courage needs a more substantial strategy to cope with the looming expiry of
supply contracts with Chef &amp; Brewer and Inntrepreneur.
Coupled with the warm weather, which should do wonders for beer sales, that
may explain the renewed outperformance of Bass's shares over the past month.
The equity market is in for a disappointment, though, if it is factoring in
much of an increase in brewing margins. It is not just a question of excess
capacity in the UK industry continuing to prevent much actual increase in
beer prices. The supermarkets have shown that it is possible to import
European lager and sell it - even duty-paid - at competitive prices. Against
that background the level of domestic capacity use becomes less and less
relevant.
Brand development thus remains a more convincing strategy than a price-based
attempt to gain market share. In Carling and Tennent's, Bass has
best-selling lagers. But Whitbread still appears to have the edge in
focusing on brand value.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Next month's launch of money market funds in Germany will not only raise
questions about redefining the money supply but also promises to put
pressure on the earnings of commercial banks which stand to lose cheap
retail deposits to the new funds. The extent of the squeeze on margins is
hard to gauge but it is unlikely to be as severe as that facing French banks
when money market funds were launched there in the late 1980s. That was a
period of high short-term interest rates, which made the funds particularly
attractive to individuals who received very little reward on their bank
deposits.
Still, there were large flows of German savings into Luxembourg last year
when money market funds where permitted there. That suggests a reasonably
high proportion of bank time deposits are footloose. The banks recovered
many of these deposits when German tax rules were changed at the start of
this year. The risk is that they will now lose them again to the money
market funds.
Broker Fox-Pitt Kelton suggests that some 40 per cent of retail time
deposits could move into money market funds over the next couple of years.
Though the big banks would be able to offset some of the higher funding
costs with commission income from managing the new funds, they would still
experience a shortfall of some 4 per cent in net earnings. The natural
response of larger banks would be to compensate by adding volume. They are
well placed to take business away from regional institutions which will find
it harder to establish money market funds of their own. The new funds could
thus accelerate consolidation in the German banking industry as well as
changing the way business is done.

Telefonica will be parading the virtues of its international arm when it
holds its pow-wow with GTE this week. The US telecoms operator is one of the
candidates to take a stake in the Spanish group's Tisa subsidiary, which
consists of shares in a collection of Latin American phone companies. AT&amp;T
and Unisource, an alliance of European operators of which Telefonica is a
member, are also candidates.
Strategic considerations will be important in choosing partners. A link-up
with GTE, which also has sizeable Latin American interests, would further
Telefonica's vision of creating a continent-wide system. A combined entity
would be better able to plan cross-border infrastructure and ensure that
most lucrative international calls were channelled over its networks.
Bringing in AT&amp;T and/or Unisource could advance Telefonica's other objective
of not being left on the edge of the big global alliances now hammered
together by BT, AT&amp;T and France Telecom/Deutsche Telekom. Given its
multiplicity of objectives, the Spanish group may try and sell stakes to all
three foreign groups.
If debt-laden Telefonica can sell each a 10 per cent stake in Tisa for the
Dollars 600m-Dollars 700m that is currently being bandied around, that would
be quite a coup. Not only would Tisa gain sufficient funds to build out its
franchises but Telefonica would also retain control.

The story that has been driving regional electricity company shares higher
is largely one of dividend growth. Sure, the regulator Prof Stephen
Littlechild will curb the companies' profits when he publishes his new price
cap regime next month. But given that dividends are typically covered three
times by earnings and balance sheets are debt free, the companies should
have no problem delivering real dividend growth of 5 per cent or more.
There is little wrong with this story as far as it goes. The professor has
already softened his proposed regime once in response to determined lobbying
from the companies. The betting is that he will give further ground,
following another round of lobbying over the past few weeks. The most likely
scenario is that the companies, currently massive cash generators, will end
up in cash-neutral or modestly cash-negative positions. Any treated more
harshly than this should appeal to the Monopolies Commission. It would have
a good chance of winning. Electricity distribution is such a low growth
industry that it is unreasonable to expect the companies to become
substantially cash-negative.
Whether they should react to a satisfactory regime by increasing real
dividends at 5 per cent a year is another matter. Such a rate of increase
would be not be in line with their ability to raise earnings. As a result,
dividend cover would fall to two or less by the end of the century. Instead,
they should be planning more aggressive moves to gear up their balance
sheets than the small-scale share purchases so far envisaged. Investors
would do better if cash was paid out of the businesses now and dividends
were then raised in line with earnings.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Flight plan for Air France
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Marcellino Oreja, Europe's transport commissioner, is expected to propose
on Wednesday that Brussels approve a FFr20bn (Pounds 2.4bn) French
government rescue of Air France, the loss-making state-owned carrier. The
case is an important test of the EU's state aids policy and of its drive to
liberalise air transport. If Mr Oreja's fellow commissioners are committed
to those policies, they should scrutinise his proposal hard.
The decision matters because the planned bail-out is by far the largest yet
in the European industry, and because Air France and Air Inter, its domestic
affiliate, together have the biggest revenues of any European airline group.
Furthermore, France's reluctance to open Orly airport to competition
suggests it is determined to continue protecting Air France  - in violation
of single market rules and of the EU integration Paris claims to favour.
If Brussels waved the rescue through, it would further blight prospects for
fair competition in an industry already beset by excess capacity. For a
company of Air France's size to receive subsidies in the amount proposed,
and on terms not available to privately-owned rivals, would jeopardise more
efficient and profitable carriers. British Airways is right to cry foul on
that score - even if its own attitude to competition has not always been
impeccable.
In judging the Air France case, the commission should ask three questions.
The first is why any state aid should be permitted. Brussels' policy is to
allow troubled carriers 'one last chance' of aid before a total cut-off in
1997. But Air France has already had more last chances than most in the
industry. Three state capital injections totalling almost FFr5bn since 1991
have failed to cure its problems.
Slimmed down
The second question is why Air France needs so much money. Lufthansa,
Germany's state-owned airline, has recently slimmed down radically without
taxpayer support. The opacity of Air France's published accounts makes it
hard to be sure that any state aid will be used to finance restructuring,
and not to cover operating losses. The commission should not entertain any
proposal for government funding unless supported by detailed financial
information and economic analysis of Air France's operations.
In any case, the company has plenty of saleable assets in the form of stakes
in Air Inter and several other profitable airlines. Yet so far, it is
proposing to dispose only of its hotel subsidiary. State aid on the scale
proposed is unjustified when the company can raise cash by selling extensive
non-core activities. By requiring it to do so, Brussels can reduce Air
France's reliance on the public purse while enhancing opportunities for
competition.
Forced disposal
The third question is what other conditions - if any - the Commission should
attach to its decision. Air France's rivals are pressing for such measures
as restrictions on its fleet capacity and the forced disposal of
unprofitable routes. However, imposing on companies purely operational
decisions, which should be left to their managements, is one of the more
objectionable features of EU state aids policy. Such interventions should
not be necessary if subsidies are rigorously policed and markets work
effectively.
The problem is that neither condition is easily fulfilled where state-owned
industries are concerned. Not only are they protected by an implicit
guarantee against bankruptcy; the lack of a market for their shares makes it
unusually difficult to judge whether state aid is being granted on
commercial terms. The right remedy is privatisation. Brussels should press
for any state aid to be linked to a deadline for full privatisation of Air
France.
Firmness is particularly important because of the French government's
failure to tackle Air France's problems. One reason Brussels was given
strong powers over competition policy was to put spine into irresolute
governments. Decisive exercise of those powers will not only serve Air
France's competitors; it will help the French economy by ending policies
which have made the carrier an international advertisement for high costs,
poor management, indifferent service and institutionalised inefficiency.

By now the whole world knows that one of the more interesting chief

founded by New Yorkers Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, threw the field open
 -and has been swamped by more than 22,000 CVs.
But how much will the new boss get? Ben and Jerry's has abandoned its
egalitarian policy of paying top executives no more than seven times
lowest-paid employees, who get an estimated Dollars 20,000 annually, giving
Ben and Jerry Dollars 140,000 under the old regime.
The company is now hoping to make it in Europe, starting with the UK. Trying

Here's a nice little earner. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has placed
an ad to find a UK representative for St Helena, to be based in the UK.
The salary, about Pounds 20,000 annually, is not inordinate wealth, but
perhaps appropriate to the task of representing an island measuring just 10
miles by five miles.
Apart from ensuring the Federal Bureau of Investigation properly conducts
its analysis of Napoleon Bonaparte's nine hairs - the FBI has been searching
for traces of arsenic in the remains of the island's most famous inhabitant
 -and overseeing the recent introduction of television for the 5,700
inhabitants, the job might not be thought onerous, especially given the
steady decline of the island's flax industry.
Preference will be given to St Helenians, 'but consideration will be given
to any appropriately qualified non-islander' in possession of
financial/commercial experience and 'current knowledge of St Helenia' (sic).

Democracy has its costs, as Russians are discovering. According to the
Russian daily newspaper Izvestia, the typical Russian male now consumes more
than 80 litres of vodka annually.
The latest figures, from 1992, indicate that alcohol consumption has
returned to the levels of 1984, the bad old days before former Soviet
president Mikhail Gorbachev launched his anti-booze drive.
More alarmingly, life expectancy for men has dropped from 65 years - in
1987, at the peak of Gorbachev's crusade - to 59.

That old philosophical chestnut - does something exist if nobody sees it? -
has been dusted off in Venezuela, where president Rafael Caldera's
government last week suspended some constitutionally guaranteed freedoms.
Caldera has also imposed foreign currency exchange controls. To defeat any
foreign currency black market, officials now may levy large fines and impose
jail terms of up to eight years.
More entertainingly, the legislation says fines up to Dollars 5,800 may be
imposed on any news medium which even mentions the activities of a
Venezuelan currency black market or cites anything but official exchange
rates.
So, not wanting to incur Caldera's wrath, let's set the record straight. You
will currently get 170 Venezuelan bolivars for Dollars 1. Officially. Any
other rates do not exist; even if the guy who offers them looks real.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Those who lament the short-termism of British industry will find plenty of
supporting evidence in the CBI's survey on manufacturers' investment
appraisal, published today. Despite an unusually sunny climate for
investment, many UK companies are acting as if little has changed. The
survey does point to serious flaws in many companies' criteria for making
investments. But UK businessmen would be short-termist indeed if they were
already betting their futures on the end of 'boom and bust'.
In spite of low inflation rates and the worldwide fall in the cost of
capital, the CBI's study found that most of the companies surveyed had not
lowered their required rates of return on new investments. Indeed, many
still aim for nominal or real rates of over 20 per cent, or impose on
projects a pay-back period of two to three years.
Findings such as these add plausibility to the oft-voiced concern that UK
companies are missing a golden chance to invest in higher capacity.
Nevertheless, a fair critique must distinguish between two different
'failings'. The first is using inefficient methods to decide on investments,
an undesirable trait in any economic climate. The second is lacking faith in
the government's triumphant long-term economic predictions.
Investment has been slower to pick up in the current recovery than in the
early 1980s, while capital expenditure by manufacturing companies is
expected to improve only modestly in 1994. Economy-wide, investment fell
less as a proportion of national output during the recession than was true
in previous downturns. For all that, the subdued state of capital outlays in
manufacturing is a worry. Are high hurdle rates to blame?
Hurdle of choice
Interpreting the 'required rates of return' which companies claim to employ
is nearly as perilous as setting them in the first place. In the survey, the
CBI makes a fair stab at determining each respondent's hurdle of choice:
whether it is measured in real or nominal terms, for example, or before or
after tax. Judged by the study's findings, many companies have been slow to
respond to recent events, but a more striking feature of the responses is
just how high many of the hurdles were to begin with. If both real and
nominal required returns started at over 20 per cent for many companies, it
would have taken large changes in inflation or the real cost of capital to
make a significant dent.
Wide variation
The sheer magnitude of hurdles such as this, taken with the wide variation
in the companies' replies, indicates that something else is going on. A
sizeable minority of companies surveyed is using rates very close to current
estimates of the true, risk-adjusted, return on capital. These are likely to
be companies with an established habit of closely relating their internal
rate of return to current financial market conditions.
Those companies citing the much higher required rates of return may be
trapped in inhospitable local credit markets. But they could also be using
the rates to reflect a wider range of factors. A vaguely defined conception
of the risk involved, for example, or to guard against over-optimism on the
part of project planners. Obviously, these are legitimate issues to
consider. But using the required rate of return ends up penalising long-term
investments. If this is what lies behind some of the high hurdles, the
companies concerned would be better off adopting other safeguards, which
would treat projects with different time horizons more equitably.
Another explanation is that the penalty on investments which take longer to
pay off is intentional. Accustomed to the ups and downs of the traditional
UK business cycle, managers demand that new capacity pay off in two to three
years because that is roughly how long they think it will be before things
turn sour. Over time, greater macro-economic stability may change matters.
On its own, a low inflation rate can have only a limited direct effect on
required rates of return: none at all, if a real rate is used. There would
be a much bigger impact if inflation were to remain stable over time, since
that would imply fewer occasions for government to put on the brakes. By all
accounts, companies have yet to see things so favourably. Given their long
experience of the opposite, this is not surprising.

FT  25 JUL 94 / An economic hero for Tony Blair: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I suspect Mr Tony Blair, the new leader of the British Labour Party, is keen
to keep abreast of US economic ideas. His advisers regard the Clinton
administration, for all its failings, as a valuable role model. My advice is
to steer well clear of the US economic establishment: there is little or
nothing he can learn from the Harvard/MIT-types now in charge in Washington.
Intellectually, they have not progressed far from the naive interventionism
of the 1960s; and they are recycling old ideas under the unimaginative
rubric of 'new Keynesian economics'.
The kind of thinker from whom Mr Blair could gain important insights is
Professor James Buchanan, the 1986 Nobel economics laureate, now at George
Mason University near Washington DC. Mr Blair should not worry that Buchanan
cites Hayek as an important influence and considers himself 'fundamentally a
libertarian'. In the 1940s British Labour leaders had the courage to embrace
the ideas of Keynes, who was hardly a socialist. Half a century later,
Buchanan has much to teach social democrats who are struggling to come to
terms with the market.
The aspect of Buchanan's thought that is likely to have greatest appeal for
Mr Blair is his concept of 'constitutional economics'. Most economists
analyse economic decisions within a pre-existing institutional framework:
the subject is about 'choice within constraints'. Decades ahead of his
colleagues Buchanan began to emphasise the broader framework: the 'choice of
constraints' as he puts it. Rather than trying to micro-manage economic
decisions the government should focus on the rules under which the game is
played. Better rules can conceivably improve prospects for everybody.
The importance of institutions is now better understood. It has, for
example, become a cliche to argue that the Bretton Woods conference of 1944
helped promote global economic growth by creating a supportive framework of
rules and institutions; 50 years on, politicians are beginning to grasp that
a new institutional structure is required in today's quite different
financial landscape.
But the ideas of constitutional economics can be applied more broadly. Take
training. Rather than planning heavy-handed interventions, Mr Blair should
formulate a 'training constitution' - a stable set of rules and
institutions, tailored to the 1990s, designed to help young people help
themselves.
By Labour's undemanding standards, Mr Blair already seems sceptical of the
public sector's ability to work economic miracles. Reading Buchanan might
greatly enhance that scepticism. He is famous (or perhaps infamous) within
the economics profession for having turned the tables on interventionists by
arguing convincingly that 'government failure' is a more serious threat than
'market failure'.
When Buchanan reached economic maturity in the 1950s, most of his colleagues
were just discovering the concept of market failure. They thought they had
scientifically proved that free markets achieve optimal outcomes only if the
most demanding conditions are met, for example, that economic agents have
perfect information and can make transactions costlessly. Since such
conditions do not hold in the real world, markets necessarily 'failed'.
Government thus had carte blanche to intervene.
Although endorsed by the profession's great intellects, it was a nonsensical
argument. Markets fail only relative to idealised mathematical models that
themselves have no foundation in reality. The practical question is whether
there is a better alternative. Buchanan argued there usually is not, because
bureaucrats and politicians are more likely to err than markets.
In one of many direct hits, he exposed the inconsistency of mainstream
economists' assumptions about behaviour in the private and public domains.
The orthodox view was that individuals in the private sector strive to
maximise their 'utility' or satisfaction but, once they cross the public
sector's portals, instantly reinvent themselves as promoters of the public
good.
Without denying the possibility of selfless action in either the public or
private spheres, Buchanan deflated confidence in government by arguing that
it was more plausible to assume that politicians and civil servants are
typically self-serving. Like the rest of us, they care more about their own
careers than the nation's welfare.
Buchanan supported this argument with an even more fundamental observation.
Government is not a simple entity that can be entrusted to make rational
decisions. Modern democratic government is instead a messy conglomerate of
disparate interests. Building on work by Knut Wicksell, the great
19th-century Swedish economist, he argued that the appropriate boundaries of
the state depend in large measure on arcane details such as voting rules and
the structure of legislative assemblies.
Roughly speaking the nearer that voting rules approach unanimous consent,
the greater the number of functions that can safely be entrusted to
government. Under simple majority voting, the favoured approach today,
government's scope should be sharply restrained, lest it trample on the
rights of minorities.
Buchanan is not just a fountain of ideas; unlike many well-heeled
Keynesians, he also has the credentials of an authentic Labour hero. Since
his family could not afford an elite private college he attended Middle
Tennessee State Teachers' College in Murfreesboro, paying his way by milking
cows morning and night. The message for the less privileged: stop bleating,
start working and you too may win a Nobel prize.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Compaq, but it's perfectly formed: Louise Kehoe on how the
US personal computer group has, unlike others, produced rapid profits growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Compaq Computer is 'the company that seems to do everything right'
competitors say with a touch of envy. While IBM, Apple Computer, Dell
Computer and other personal computer manufacturers struggle to keep pace,
Compaq goes from strength to strength.
Last week, the Houston, Texas, company reported record second-quarter sales
of Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn), up 53 per cent from the same quarter last
year. Net profits for the quarter were more than doubled to Dollars 210m,
compared with Dollars 102m a year before. If sales continue to grow at this
rate, Compaq will overtake Apple and IBM to become the world's largest
personal computer company ahead of its 1996 target. In terms of numbers of
computers sold, rather than revenues, the company is already outselling all
rivals.
Similarly, in the market for PC 'servers' - the computers used to boost the
performance of office PC networks - Compaq has stolen a lead with an
estimated Dollars 2bn share of the Dollars 5bn world market.
With higher gross margins than any other PC manufacturer and among the
highest revenues per employee in the computer industry, Compaq is also a
Wall Street favourite. The company's investors have seen the value of their
shares soar over the past two years from about Dollars 20 to more than
Dollars 90 (before a recent three for one stock split).
Compaq's performance is all the more remarkable because three years ago the
company was in crisis. Market share was falling rapidly and profits
languished as the company struggled in the face of fierce competition from
smaller PC makers offering cheaper products.
In a move that shocked even hard-bitten industry observers, Compaq's board
of directors fired Mr Rod Canion, the company's popular founder, in 1991 and
replaced him as chief executive with Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, a German engineer
who had built up Compaq's European operations.
Mr Pfeiffer has overhauled the company. As other large US computer companies
struggle to adapt to rapidly changing technology and market conditions,
Compaq's almost textbook turnaround could provide a model. 'I know only one
company to compare ourselves with and that is Compaq,' says Mr Enrico
Pesatori, a senior executive at Digital Equipment, the Massachusetts-based
computer maker, who is responsible for restructuring the computer systems
business.
'We can no longer characterise Compaq as just a PC company,' he adds. 'It is
a company that has perfectly interpreted the new style of computing that is
emerging, based on networks of PCs.'
For those looking to learn from Compaq's return to vigorous, profitable
growth, six main conditions for a turnaround emerge from its story:
Swift action. Compaq reacted quickly when its financial performance declined
in mid-1991. Within six months of the first signs of trouble, the company
had redrawn its strategy to emphasise the importance of winning market
share, realigned its management and begun restructuring its operations.
Good corporate governance. These steps would probably not have been taken
had it not been for pressure exerted on Compaq's management by its board of
directors. Unlike many companies in the computer industry, Compaq's chairman
is a non-executive director, rather than the chief executive and all other
members of the board (except for the chief executive) are also drawn from
outside the company.
This structure 'allows the board to preserve its role of supervising
management,' says Mr Ben Rosen, Compaq chairman. 'In good times it doesn't
matter how the board is constituted. It is when there is a problem, a
corporate issue, a strategic change or a management change that it is very
useful to have a truly independent board.'
Cutting the right costs. While Compaq was initially forced to lay off
workers, the company quickly refocused on improving its manufacturing
efficiency. Over the two years ending December 1993 Compaq quadrupled its
production volumes while adding only about 500 workers, bringing its total
workforce to just over 10,500. 'Our strategy was never just to cut costs,'
says Mr Daryl White, chief financial officer. The drastic cost reductions
under way at some of the largest computer companies without much evidence of
efforts to boost revenues 'is very dangerous; they are on a downward
spiral', he observes.
Willingness to change. 'The cleverest strategy is useless unless management
has the willingness, the guts, to implement it,' says Mr Gian Carlo Bisone,
Compaq vice-president responsible for US marketing. 'We had to change the
mindset of the whole company from building the highest-performance products
in the industry to building products that are well positioned to take
advantage of the 'sweetspot' of the market at the right cost, so that we
could price them aggressively.'
Becoming 'customer focused': Compaq adopted this philosophy earlier than
most and moved aggressively to make the changes needed for the term to be
meaningful. 'The key decision was to shift this company from being a
product-centric company to becoming a customer-centric company,' says Mr
Bisone. Until 1991, for example, Compaq sold its products exclusively
through independent computer dealers (chains such as Computer Land that
dominated the PC market until the late 1980s).
Today, says Mr Bisone, 'we sell computers wherever the customer wants to buy
them. If they want to buy them in gas stations, that is where we will sell
them'. It has not come to that yet, but Compaq PCs are sold by mail and
telephone, in department stores as well as through traditional dealers.
Another radical change for Compaq was to broaden its marketing operations.
To be profitable at competitive prices, the company had to increase the
volume of its sales. That meant addressing every segment of the market. 'We
have more than doubled the size of the potential market we go after,' says
Mr Pfeiffer.
Set aggressive goals. From its drive to create cost-competitive products in
1992 to its current ambitions to take over market leadership, Mr Pfeiffer
has always set 'stretch' goals for Compaq.
Despite its impressive achievements, the history of the personal computer
industry suggests that past success is no guarantee of future prosperity.
The danger Compaq faces is that its fast rate of growth could mean a slip
leading to a serious setback.
One of the toughest challenges the company faces is how to ensure it can
meet unpredictable demand for its products. Last year, for example, its
sales of servers were limited by parts supply problems.
In an attempt to overcome this problem, the company has encouraged its
suppliers to collaborate on 'just-in-time' delivery to its Houston factory.
Parts are stored in a warehouse close to the plant, with some parts being
delivered hourly.
To keep up its hectic pace of growth the company has this year begun
expanding its manufacturing facilities at all three existing sites - in
Texas, Scotland and Singapore - while also opening a factory in Brazil and
an assembly plant in China. Simultaneously, Compaq is developing products
that will take advantage of advances in multimedia and interactive
television. On the corporate computing front it is improving the performance
of its servers to challenge IBM and Digital.
Some observers worry that Compaq may be stretching itself too thinly. But it
remains confident. 'The best companies are those that have hit the wall and
bounced back quickly,' says Mr White. 'The plank that hit us over the head
in 1991 is still indelibly etched on our foreheads,' adds Mr Rosen.

FT  25 JUL 94 / A look at life from both sides: FT writers on the trend for
Europe's top financial staff to switch between public and private sectors

RIDDING and PETER WISE

<TEXT>
Mr Gert Haller, the swashbuckling 50-year-old state secretary at Germany's
finance ministry, has been made an offer he could not refuse. Mr Haller, who
acts as deputy to Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, in international
monetary affairs, is leaving to join Wustenrot, the privately owned German
building society and banking group.
Mr Haller's departure, to take effect in January, will mark the second
important switch at the ministry within 18 months. His predecessor, Mr Horst
Kohler, who held the post since 1990, departed last summer, also aged 50, to
become head of the German savings banks association.
The job changes in Bonn illustrate how, across Europe, frontiers are
becoming more fluid between senior financial positions inside and out of
government. International financial deregulation, fast growth of capital
markets and sophistication of banking groups like Wustenrot are increasing
career opportunities beyond the public sector.
Since Mr Kohler took over at the German savings association last August, two
other middle-ranking civil servants have joined him. 'They find the work
more interesting, of course,' one Bonn official says. 'Financially it has to
make sense, but we are not talking about a 300 or 400 per cent pay rise.
What seems to be most important is that the pensions are properly sorted
out.'
Germany is not the only country where higher private-sector salaries and
more free-wheeling lifestyles exert a strong attraction when budgetary
pressures are squeezing civil servants' pay.
In the Netherlands, where there is more traditional interplay between public
and private-sector financial jobs than in Germany, board members at Dutch
banks can earn up to five times the annual wage of Fl 200,000 (Pounds
73,500) oftop civil servants at the finance ministry.
And Sir Peter Middleton, permanent secretary at the UK Treasury between 1983
and 1991, is thought to have increased his salary of Pounds 96,210 between
threefold and fivefold since becoming chairman of BZW, the investment
banking arm of Barclays Bank.
Departures of European financial civil servants to senior positions in banks
do not represent a new trend. But officials now seem willing to take up
private-sector jobs at an earlier stage in their careers.
This may presage a shift to greater flexibility in employment between the
government and business sectors, similar to the 'revolving door' in the US
where senior Washington functionaries traditionally rotate between
government and non-government posts.
Mr Haller's departure from the Bonn finance ministry marks a welcome break
from the general picture of 'regrettable impermeability' between the public
and private sectors in Germany, according to Mr Fritz von Gadow, an
executive at the Dusseldorf office of Spencer, Stuart, the international
personnel consultants.
He says Germany has too little US-type flexibility. 'It's unfortunate that
real life isn't represented in the ministries.'
As for suggestions that Mr Haller would have been better advised by going to
a higher-profile bank, Mr von Gadow says Wustenrot is a respectable address.
'They have their own bank and are in every sense a big financial services
group.'
Until now in Europe, regular switches between finance ministries and banks
have been mostly confined to countries like France, with a tradition of
state ownership in banking. Mr Marc Vienot, chairman of now-privatised
Societe Generale, Mr Michel Pebereau, chairman of similarly privatised
Banque Nationale de Paris, and Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, former chairman of
Paribas and Credit Lyonnais, all held senior jobs in the French finance
ministry.
After several years of privatisation of banks and industrial companies in
France, there are now signs that relationships between the public and
private sectors are becoming much less cosy. Last week the Paris government
announced it is phasing out the practice under which civil servants are
allowed to retain indefinitely their ranking while working in the private
sector.
In countries without large state-owned banks, moves between the helm of
public and private sectors have been far less automatic than in France - but
they now seem to be less exceptional. Mr Karl Otto Pohl, president of the
Bundesbank between l980 and 1991, resigned at 61 to join the Cologne-based
Sal Oppenheim banking group - the first Bundesbank chief not to go
immediately into retirement on departure. Mr Pohl's resignation was partly
caused by divergences with the government over policies on German
unification, but it also reflected his desire to increase his salary.
Another example of a sideways move comes from Portugal. Mr Manuel Pinho, 39,
currently director-general of the Portuguese Treasury, will leave this
summer and is expected to take up a job at a so far undisclosed private
bank.
After working for the US bank Manufacturers Hanover, as well as Credit
Lyonnais, Mr Pinho moved to the Portuguese finance ministry to carry out a
radical restructuring of Portugal's borrowing programme during the past two
years. His spell in government will certainly stand him in considerable
stead.
'When I ring someone in government I know they are going to take the call
because they know who I am,' says one Portuguese executive who spent a spell
as the head of a civil service department before moving into private
banking.
Another man with experience of life in both public and private sectors is
Sir Douglas Wass, now 71, permanent secretary to the UK Treasury between
1974 and 1983. He holds three non-executive chairmanships - Equity &amp; Law
Life Assurance, Nomura International and the NCM credit insurance group -
and is on the board of three international trade and insurance groups.
Sir Douglas warns that officials who move relatively early from public to
private-sector jobs have a greater chance of success. 'The culture in
government is one of risk aversion and propriety of decision taking. In the
private sector it is risk orientated . . . My own feeling is that a
successful transfer after the age of 40 or 50 is rare. One becomes too
engrained to become a successful entrepreneur.'
Experience in the Netherlands underlines this argument. Mr Cees Maas, 47,
formerly treasurer-general (the top civil servant) at the finance ministry,
left in July 1992 to join the board of Internationale Nederlanden Groep (ING
Group), the big Dutch financial services company. Mr Maas's predecessor, Mr
Pieter Korteweg, who departed in 1986, aged 44, has since headed Robeco, the
Rotterdam-based group of international investment funds.
Mr Dick Meys, now 51, was director-general for the budget, another senior
job at the ministry, until the late 1970s. He is now a board member at ABN
Amro, the Netherlands' biggest bank.
The present treasurer-general at the Dutch finance ministry, Mr Henk
Brouwer, is himself 48. He came to the job after a long spell in the civil
service followed by two years working for Philips, the big electronics
group. If the trend towards an American-style 'revolving door' picks up
momentum in Europe, Mr Brouwer's job path may mark the shape of careers to
come.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Individuals must pay the cost of a
civilised society
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr A ALLCOCK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Parker eloquently puts the case for differential pricing within a
privatised post office (Personal View, July 14). It is tempting to accept
this argument, which is based on the demand for economic efficiency and
correctly apportioned costs that are supposedly necessary in an unregulated,
competitive market, and also on the inappropriateness of cross-subsidisation
of one element of society - in this case rural dwellers - by another.
Even in highly competitive markets, however, it is often the case that
pricing is not directly related to costs in a rigid sense.
Where a company wants to increase its market share it will undercut the
competition, taking greater profits from areas where it is better
established and more secure. This happens on a national and international
basis and is cross-subsidisation of one element of society, or country, by
another by business itself. To think that cross-subsidisation will cease on
privatisation is wrong.
As to whether one element of society should cross-subsidise another anyway,
this is just an extension of the increasingly popular
the-individual-pays-for-what-he-consumes argument.
It appears economically efficient and fair. Taking this to extremes,
however, encourages envy and creates division among members of society.
This is because it does not consider the duty that individuals must assume
in the maintenance of society at a given level of civilisation as payment
for the benefits that individuals derive from living in such a society -
these too have a cost.
The attractive and obvious simplicity of the arguments advanced by
economists like David Parker are contagious and increasingly common. But
applying them unthinkingly to more and more services/products in isolation
is dangerous.
The application of a wider cost/benefit analysis in an effort to measure how
society at large benefits is the real challenge.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Sid could help Germany develop
'equity culture'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From E H CLAUSSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Waller's report ('Resisting the bait of equity ownership', July
14) misses two points when he lists actions to overcome the lack of an
'equity culture' in Germany.
First, the leading German banks must create incentives for young people to
become involved in stock exchanges.
For decades these banks have erected ever higher barriers for young
newcomers to these exciting markets. I imagine the bankers consider the
short-term costs too high and they have failed to recognise their primary
long-term responsibility. Without a broadly based participation, starting
with the young, I cannot see an 'equity culture' developing in Germany.
Second, several decades ago the German government created the Volksaktie
when selling, for example, Volkswagen. If the government decides again to
sell off state enterprises such as Lufthansa and Telekom, I hope it will
look to the UK and learn from its series of successful privatisation
programmes.
Sid could be very useful in helping the German government and banks to
develop an 'equity culture' in Germany.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Vocational training needs to perform
a giant leap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KEN RUDDIMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article ('Staying on can mean missing out', July 20) gives a
timely reminder to young people to take a long-term view of what they can do
when they leave school at 16.
In a society which is biased towards the immediate, and with a government
opposed to planning, there is little example to follow and the modern
apprenticeship is seen by many as yet another small step for training when
clearly a giant leap is called for.
The lack of demand you highlight is matched by surplus supply - technical
colleges mothball or eliminate potential training provision in construction
and engineering.
While the government vehemently denies a stop-go policy in the economy, you
supply clear evidence of it in an area which is crucial to long-term
consistent growth.
The twin-track approach does not work. We are not Germany. We do not have
parity of esteem between the academic and vocational routes, and until we do
we will always have an under-achieving, under-resourced, Division Two, which
attracts few and is dismissed by many.

FT  25 JUL 94 / The recovery is now near worldwide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is now strong evidence that recovery is worldwide. It started in North
America, where it has already reached the margins of safety, then spread to
devaluing European countries and is now reaching hard-currency countries
such as Germany and France.
Japan is the most doubtful prospect; but even here there are signs that the
economy is slowly adapting to the over-valued yen by domestic demand
expansion and even more stringent cost-control by exporters.
The developing countries, which in previous cycles danced to the tune of the
older industrial world, are now a sustaining force. They did not experience
the last recession and are now growing at twice the rate of the countries of
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
Indeed, the OECD has revised its projections upwards for the first time
since 1991. Oxford Economic Forecasting, in a more up-to-date comprehensive
survey, has higher projections still. The surprise element has been the
strength of continental Europe, especially Germany. While at the start of
the year many analysts were expecting no growth at all in that country, OEF
is now projecting all-German growth to be 2.2 per cent in 1994, rising to
2.9 per cent in 1995.
Forecasts are merely a way of articulating present indications; and OEF is
very frank that its revised view is based on 'glowing widespread survey
evidence across the European continent', especially industrial confidence
and production expectations.
The present business cycle has much in common with that of the 1980s. Each
downturn has engendered a desperate belief that the world has entered a
long-term depression phase; then there have been mutterings that recovery
will not create new jobs; and finally concerns about inflationary
overheating have re-emerged. It is, of course, nonsense to disconnect output
and jobs. Unless newly employed workers produce nothing or negative amounts
the two must go together. Unemployment has fallen in the US and the UK,
where output has been rising briskly; and the OECD expects it to level off
in Europe as growth returns to trend.
In the Group of Seven countries, total demand in cash terms - measured by
nominal gross domestic product - is now growing by about 5 per cent a year.
Because of surplus capacity and associated competitive pressures, the
inflation rate in these countries has fallen back to 2 per cent, leaving
room for normal growth plus modest catch-up of about 3 per cent.
So long as nominal demand in the main countries grows at about 5 per cent a
year, the world economy is largely self-correcting and unlikely to
experience an inflationary take-off or a spiralling depression. Demand
growth did, however, dip perilously low in the last recession. In 1993 it
was only 4.1 per cent in the G7 countries. In Germany demand growth was 2
1/2 per cent and in France 1 1/2 per cent. Sound money economists could
perfectly reasonably warn about demand deficiency last year, as they did at
a corresponding point in the 1980s.
At what stage does the risk flip over to being one of excess demand leading
to renewed inflation? Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England,
mentioned three contingencies in which interest rates might have to be
raised at his June 8 meeting with Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. The first
was 'if the pace of activity picked up more rapidly'. The second was 'if
cost increases threatened the prospect for prices a year or two ahead'.
Third, and more implicitly, he might want to tighten policy if the growth of
M0 did not decelerate in the coming months.
Nevertheless, the governor's standpoint could be guyed as saying: 'Shoot it
if it moves.' The latest flash indicator for the second quarter does indeed
show UK output rising fairly briskly - 2.7 per cent for non-oil GDP in the
year up to the second quarter. (The North Sea oil sector is part of the
economy, but it is so erratic that output trends are best measured without
it.) Indeed, non-oil GDP has only just passed its 1990 peak. If capacity has
been growing at a normal rate, this suggests that the margin of slack is now
about 10 per cent - surely more than the safety level.
All the indicators the governor mentioned do, indeed, need to be monitored
and many more. But some framework, such as nominal GDP, or nominal domestic
expenditure, is required to put them together and provide appropriate
weights. Otherwise, he will be playing into the hands of the bond-market
commentators who want to resolve all doubts in favour of tightening policy.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Steps to meet product safety
obligations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRIAN BATEMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Stephen Sidkin and Nigel Miller ('Stay Secure on Safety', July 19)
rightly point to changes in the law on product safety which affect all in
the supply chain. They stop short of advice on how to meet the new
obligations imposed by the general product safety regulations, however.
The UK has an excellent record of product safety. Manufacturers have taken
great care to meet and to exceed safety requirements. Part of the reason for
this impressive record is our commitment to safety standards and to product
marking showing that standards have been met.
The British Standards Institution (BSI), established by the engineering
profession and industry, was the world's first national standards body. The
BSI kitemark, well known to consumers, has been around since the 1920s and
provides our independent assurance of a product's conformity with standards.
They point to the one defence under the legislation. A producer who took
'all reasonable steps and exercised due diligence' could demonstrate his
care to avoid the offence. The surest way for manufacturers is to: Have the
products 'type tested'. This will tell whether the design is safe.
Manufacture under a quality management system to ensure that specifications
will be consistently met. This helps ensure that each individual product
meets the same criteria as the original design. Such a system also involves
the keeping of records which assist in answering questions which may arise.
Ensure that the criteria for any legal marking requirements are satisfied.
Consider using a product certification scheme, such as the kitemark to give
purchasers confidence.
It is also essential for the future that the UK continues to make a full
input to European and international standards. These will increasingly be
used as benchmarks of best practice by the courts. Industry must make its
views known on all relevant standards, through participation in BSI's work
as the UK representative in European and international forums.
With the Local Authorities Co-ordinating Body for Food and Trading
Standards, BSI is holding a conference in October on the role of standards
in assuring product safety. I hope that many of your readers - and your
contributors - will be interested in participating.

Josette Simon takes the title role in Ibsen's 'The Lady from the Sea'. This
role, played by actresses from Duse to Vanessa Redgrave, is one of Ibsen's
most probing studies of femininity: a woman frigid within marriage, haunted
by the terrifying claims of a past lover, unable to give herself to the
husband she loves. The production comes to the Lyric, Hammersmith, from the
West Yorkshire Playhouse.

Nobody would be more delighted than Ethel Smyth at the high profile women
composers have been enjoying this year. Jailed as a suffragette and a
larger-than-life personality (she once went golfing in her pyjamas in the
Sudanese desert) Ethel Smyth defied convention and fought to achieve her
musical ambitions. Next Sunday the BBC Proms present a concert performance
of her most successful work, the opera 'The Wreckers', first staged in
Leipzig in 1906.

The festival opens tonight with 'Parsifal', but the main interest this year
is a new production of 'The Ring', staged by Alfred Kirchner and conducted
by James Levine. Its most controversial aspect may well turn out to be the
designs of German illustrator Rosalie. John Tomlinson returns as Wotan, and
Wolfgang Schmidt is the new Siegfried. Last year's 'Tristan und Isolde' is
revived with Siegfried Jerusalem and Waltraud Meier.

In 1991 a young British photographer, Paul Jenks, was killed by a sniper in
Croatia. Two of his friends believe that there was more to his death than a
chance sniper's bullet and they return there to seek some answers. This is a
promising start to a series of Travels with my camera in which writers go
after the stories armed with nothing more than a simple Hi-8 camera (Channel
4 at 9pm).
It seems that everything is being forced into the game show format. Last
week it was pets in 'Pets Win Prizes', in which chickens, tortoises and
ferrets strove for glory. Tonight it is the countryside in The Big Country
Quest, (BBC 1 at 7.30) in which townies are made fun of as they try to
master such rural crafts as goat milking and duck herding. Its an idea
culled from 'The Generation Game' and fits nicely into a lack-lustre
evening, with the only likely diversions the light hearted Frank Stubbs (ITV
at 9pm) and the repeat of The Singing Detective (BBC 1 at 10.10), part of
the tribute to the late Dennis Potter. On second showing it is perversely
arty, but when the film dissolves into song and dance the impact is still
tremendous.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Arts: Days of hope - Jackie Wullschlager on images of the
post-war American dream
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was the best known photographic exhibition of all time. From 1955, when
it opened at New York's Museum of Modern Art, through the 1960s, when it
toured the world, more than 9m people saw Edward Steichen's show The Family
of Man.
Its images shaped the consciousness of a generation: Eugene Smith's two
children in 'The Walk to Paradise Garden', Andreas Feininger's crowd scene
on Fifth Avenue, Robert Doisneau's kissing couple in Paris. Its message of
peace during the cold war drew unprecedented queues of visitors in the US,
Berlin, Tokyo. When, two weeks before he died in 1963, John F. Kennedy made
a legendary speech on the family of man, he used the term given popular
currency by Steichen's show.
Now, in a bold and imaginative move, the exhibition has been recreated and
set up in a permanent home at the centre of Europe. At Chateau de Clervaux,
an airy castle near Steichen's birth place in Luxembourg, the monumental
black and white prints are hung, as in 1955, around scenes which cross
cultures and races.
Steichen described the 503 images culled from more than 10,000 photographs
as 'a mirror of the essential oneness of mankind throughout the world'. His
selection shows a passion for vivid human involvement: the excitement of a
first glance, a pair of clenched hands, a sprawl of legs at a dance, a boy
spearing an antelope.
Yet time has also proved his critical acumen, for every picture on the wall
is a consummate work of art. Cartier-Bresson, Brassai, Bill Brandt, Diane
Arbus - the names which moulded 20th-century photography are all here,
making this show not just a historic reconstruction but the story of an art
form.
Forty years on, it is the emotion and optimism of the pictures that catches
you breathless as you walk into the opening sequence of lovers: in an
English meadow, in an Italian wood beside an abandoned bicycle, as part of a
New Guinea tribe, at a Louisiana dance hall. Crowd scenes pull you in -
swanky faces from five tiers of the Paris Opera, boastful children in a
Brandt street scene.
Exquisite compositions such as Doisneau's picture of a policeman watching a
woman watch a couple embrace by the Seine, ask you to join a circle of
voyeurs. All pure sentiment and familiarity hold sway - witness Eugene
Smith's children in a brightly lit garden, an image of hope and love so
emotive that at a recent trial run of the exhibition in Tokyo, many visitors
wept openly over it.
Steichen captioned Smith's picture 'a world to be born under your
footsteps', and today it is a vision of the 1950s American dream that we
respond to it. (It is no coincidence that the image made one of Ford's most
successful motor car advertisements.) Like many works here, it is stamped
with American icons - sports car, roller coaster, fast-food joint.
Ralph Crane's shot of six teenagers speeding down a tree-lined avenue in a
1940s convertible, Robert Frank's line of college girls devouring 20-cent
hamburgers, breathe that mix of exhilaration and banality which was
mid-century US life.
Cumulatively such pictures announce a faith in youth and progress, in New
Deal prosperity and the pioneering American spirit.
The beginnings of teen culture, Rock Around the Clock, Lolita, West Side
Story, were the family of man's contemporaries and Steichen, like Humbert
Humbert and Old World emigres in love with the New, was perfectly placed to
celebrate the grandeur of young America. At the centre of his show, like an
altar piece, he placed a giant Ansel Adams' California landscape. Surrounded
by the bars and playgrounds on every day Main Street, it is a homage which
recalls the vast journey from motel to motel that Humbert Humbert made
across the country with Lolita.
These comparisons crystallise how this show has dated in the best possible
way. For the family of man is not a general balanced view from five
continents but an artistic expression fixed in time and place. Its images
unfold like the grand scenes of history, and what gives them the lasting
quality of myth is that, like Rembrandt's portraits of Flemish burghers or
the Velasquez's Spanish nobles, they distil an inescapable sense of their
age, and yet out of that precision emerges something universal.
All this is clear with hindsight, which also makes apparent what a splendid
exercise in benign propaganda this exhibition must have been during the cold
war.
Symbolically, its first stop in Europe was Berlin, where it was greeted with
fervour by a public not long liberated from the blockade. Even a
quintessentially German artist like August Sander seems in Steichen's
persuasive American context denationalised; his 'The Hod Carrier', an
oppressed German worker resembles an entrepreneurial mid-westerner. In the
same way, Brassai's famous duo the Members of Big Albert's Gang, plus
d'Italie, here set among clean-living American teenyboppers, loses its
Gallic menace and wit.
This exhibition will come increasingly to resemble a mid-century US export.
A key prop is a ballot box stuck over with photos of individuals voting in
Turkey, Japan, France; behind it a huge frame features a United Nations
meeting. In the groups of families from around the world, it is now easy to
detect a sense of US superiority - Talcott Parson's influential essay 'The
Normal American Family' appeared the year the exhibition opened.
Yet Steichen's images are large enough for this not to matter. In his last
sequence, a screen showing elderly couples - a gnarled pair from Canada, an
impassive, identically-dressed Chinese couple, a fat, bourgeois yet
uncertain German pair, a frail and stern couple of Sicilians - forms an
entrance to a final room plastered with motifs of playing children.
Of course, traditional American family values are here - respectability,
monogamy, the safe social order of grandparents and grandchildren. But this
intimate section also invites us to place ourselves between youth and age,
to ponder our own family, society. Each viewer will take from it something
different - which is what makes this exhibition so rewarding.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Arts: A legend in search of form - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The celebrated German mezzo Brigitte Fassbaender is already something of a
legend: since making her debut in the early 1960s, she has sung many of the
great mezzo roles in the world's leading opera houses, and recently she has
also turned her hand to directing opera.
She is admired on the concert platform, and as the warm reception she
received at the Wigmore Hall last week shows she has a devoted following.
Her artistry has always been highly individual, but in this recital her
opening group of Mahler songs disclosed some worrying mannerisms.
Fassbaender's instrument is perhaps not as flexible as it was, and hardens
under pressure.
Of course, great interpretations are not made on sheer vocal beauty alone;
but the occasional lapses of intonation would have mattered less had she
brought a sense of life - vital in Mahler - and been less free with
dynamics. The opening Rheinlegendchen had a Weillian, coarseness about it,
and she missed the radiance of Liebst du um Schonheit. At least she captured
the lonely desolation of another Ruckert setting, Ich bin der Weltabhanden
gekommen.
Indeed: her approach seemed wholly better suited to Aribert Reimann's stark
Eingedunkelt cycle, written for Fassbaender and premiered by her last year,
here receiving its first UK performance.
A setting of nine short impressions of Auschwitz by the poet Paul Celan
(pseudonym of the Romanian Paul Antsohel, who lost both his parents in a
concentration camp), the cycle succeeds as a powerful lament where the
horror of its subject can defy description.
Eingedunkelt is set for a lone, unaccompanied voice and Fassbaender
delivered the mournful, declamatory lines with incisive eloquence.
The second half of the programme brought a reminder of Fassbaender's
diversity and was pure, unalloyed pleasure. In two early Berg songs, Wo der
Goldregen steht and Ferne Lider, she found the sense of line missing from
her Mahler, and allowed the beauty of her voice to come through.
The programme lightened up with Milhaud's cheeky Trois chansons de negresse,
Fassbaender caressing the lines like a chanteuse and her pianist, Wolfram
Riegen (who had been excellent in Berg's four Op 2 Lieder) coming into his
own with the swinging accompaniments.
Fassbaender put everything into her final group of Weill Songs, delivering
such numbers as Nannas Lied, Wie lange noch? and Berlin im Licht with
pungent vocal utterance. These seemed to say the most about Fassbaender's
art today.

FT  25 JUL 94 / People (Names in the News): Todo bom's hot line in Portugal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Luis Todo Bom's climb to the top of the Portuguese business world has earned
him a reputation as a strong-willed administrator with a low tolerance for
complacency, writes Peter Wise.
These qualities will be much in demand in his new post as president of
Portugal Telecom, the country's largest company, measured by number of
employees, which was created through last month's merger of three
state-owned telecommunications utilities.
Todo Bom, 46, faces the task of forging these unwieldy companies with
different cultures into an attractive competitive enterprise; next year up
to 30 per cent of Portugal Telecom will be floated in the country's biggest
ever privatisation.
He will not countenance resistance in his attempts to reshape the sector.
Todo Bom is known for driving people hard. Former associates say his
aggressive style means he is rarely challenged in the boardroom.
Like several other prominent Portuguese, Todo Bom, originally a chemical
engineer, began his career at Sines, a state-run oil, industrial and port
complex that has proved something of a white elephant. Very much a
politician - he is now a vice-president of the governing centre-right Social
Democratic party - by 1983 he had been appointed head of the Tourism Fund,
which dispenses government grants.
Later, he served as junior industry minister from 1985 to 1987, and has
since held a number of administrative posts in public-sector companies, and
was appointed head of the now-extinct Telecom Portugal at the beginning of
this year.

FT  25 JUL 94 / People (Names in the News): Baker - not spooked by French
films
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEREMY KAHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
William Baker, just appointed as president of the Motion Picture Export
Association of America, is more used to busting international crime
syndicates than breaking down trade barriers, writes Jeremy Kahn.
But the 54-year-old former FBI agent is confident his law enforcement
experience will serve him well as the second-in-command of the US motion
picture industry's vocal and powerful export lobby.
Baker held increasingly important posts during his 26 years at the FBI, at
one time overseeing a Dollars 750m budget and directing all of the agency's
criminal investigations with the exception of counter-
espionage. He also spent two years attempting to overhaul the public image
of the CIA, oversaw the FBI's counter-terrorism operations during the Gulf
War and received numerous distinguished service awards.
Retiring from the FBI in 1991, Baker was hired by Jack Valenti, the
president of the US Motion Picture Association - whose colourful antics
earned him the nickname 'Happy Jack' - to head the anti-piracy division of
its export lobby. Valenti, in his turn had checked him out: 'William Webster
(former FBI and CIA chief) told me he was probably the finest executive he
ever encountered.'
Valenti credits Baker with 'totally reorganising' the anti-piracy division
in the past three years and was therefore his 'first choice' when looking
for a replacement for Myron Karlin, who steps down as president of the
export association after nine years.
Baker says his first goal will be 'addressing the post-Gatt environment in
the EU' and obtaining 'a level playing field' for US films. At last year's
Uruguay Round, members of the Gatt rejected US attempts to open French
markets to more US films.
'I don't think (the Uruguay Round) closed any doors; it just failed to open
the door solidly,' Baker says. 'We will work with every government within
the EU to convince them to open their markets.'
After Europe, Baker plans to turn to Asia, where video piracy and abuse of
intellectual property rights are reported to be rampant.

FT  25 JUL 94 / People: Still sitting tight in the electric chair - Seventy
this week, Lord Weinstock explains to Bernard Gray why, as custodian of
GEC's history, he is still shaping its future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This Friday Lord Weinstock, managing director of GEC, will be 70. Yet there
will be no great fanfare or party at GEC; no gathering of the great and the
good. 'No, I shall enjoy a quiet dinner in Salzberg with my friend Riccardo
Muti, the conductor. His birthday is the day before mine and we have done
the same thing for the past 12 years.'
The juxtaposition of calculating businessman and contemplative music lover
is only one of the tensions in Arnold Weinstock's character. He is a
cultured and retiring man who has taken difficult and painful decisions in a
tough industry. He lives well but abhors waste in his business. He is an
ardent racehorse-owner who is too busy working to watch them run. He keeps a
vice-like grip on every important financial detail of GEC, yet is none the
less prepared to put his most valuable assets into joint ventures when the
strategic need compels.
To him there is no contradiction between the private man and public manager.
'I do not see the difficulty. I enjoy living well but it would be wrong to
waste the company's money.'
He also has some singular ambitions. On Desert Island Discs last year he
confessed that in his youth he had dreamed of being an ice hockey player,
but now he wishes he were a conductor.
For his sins, however, he is neither an ice hockey player nor a conductor
but the custodian of a large part of Britain's electronics industry, and has
been for a generation. His views about the company's future are inevitably
tied to the way he has developed it since he brought together the three
great UK electrical companies, GEC, AEI and English Electric in the late
1960s.
At 70, he is well past the normal retirement age for a chief executive, but
the board has just asked him to stay on as managing director for at least a
further two years. As a result, the next phase of the GEC's development is
in the hands of the man who has shaped its recent history.
Weinstock's long occupancy of the British electric chair has sparked plenty
of controversy, both by the aggression with which he formed the modern GEC,
and his apparent stolidity since.
Observers have lionised and vilified him in almost equal measure. To look
back through the contemporary accounts is to watch an inexorably shifting
pattern. Weinstock was the man with the marketing flair who would save
consumer electronics, the man with the management vision to integrate
Britain's sprawling hi-tech industrial base, the man with the grasp of
detail to keep profligate engineers on the straight and narrow.
But as the glow of technological promise faded, GEC seemed to fade with it.
Arnold Weinstock was made to carry the weight of disappointed expectations.
If only GEC had been more adventurous in cutting edge technologies. If only
the company had not leaned so heavily on government contracts. If only GEC
had used that legendary cash pile. If only Arnold Weinstock hadn't been so
cautious.
Weinstock turns aside brickbats in much the same way that he declines
bouquets. There is, however, a tightness around his eyes when critics are
mentioned which suggests that the barbs do strike home.
'These people do not understand our industry. We have taken some failing
poor businesses which were deeply in debt and turned them into successful
rich companies. And we do spend money. We have spent Pounds 2bn on
acquisitions in the past seven years and Pounds 406m of our own money on
research and development last year alone.'
The arguments have become so entrenched on both sides that the battle takes
on a weary familiarity.
Critics say that GEC has abandoned the technological high ground; Weinstock
argues that he will make anything for which there is a profitable market.
The charge is laid that he has retreated from the market to cosy government
contracts; he points out that external forces such as the relentless advance
of the Japanese in consumer electronics have in part shaped the company's
direction. Weinstock seems to feel the pain of criticism, and there is a
hint of residual disappointment that the company's achievements, and his own
lifetime's efforts, are not better recognised.
For all that, his personal style has not changed in a quarter of a century.
The functional office in Stanhope Gate. The telephone with a bank of direct
dial lines to contact any of his senior managers instantly if there is a
problem. The monthly reports from 150 subsidiaries which stress key
financial ratios, all of which are scrutinised by the managing director
personally; many are annotated in red felt tip pen, often with brutally
direct comments.
'I'm not the kind of manager who can grasp a situation and make a decision
in the same kind of very impressive instinctive way that Jules Thorn
(founder of the now Thorn EMI) did. I must have the data to make a
decision.'
On the future of GEC and his own succession Weinstock is moderately candid.
'There are some things I still need to do. I need to sort out our mix of
industrial businesses and put some more things into joint ventures. For that
it is important to know the people who will be your partners.'
His vision of the company in 20 years is a detailed development of the
present, rather than a radical shift or a new strategy for a new millennium.
'In power engineering we are second only to ABB and we will prosper further.
Electricity is not going to be replaced, and we can meet future demand.'
The list continues. GEC has a good position in telecoms, albeit in a much
smaller market than its partner Siemens. Defence electronics will hunker
down for the tough times ahead - he still hankers after a joint venture to
pool his business with BAe.
And though Weinstock wants to keep working he accepts that he will
eventually have to move over. 'There is enough talent in the businesses to
take over. Other people will come forward with their own ideas, but I would
like to retain some kind of consultative role, I think that would be
useful.'
There has been much speculation in the City that he would like his son Simon
to replace him, though many investing institutions would strongly oppose the
idea unless Simon could demonstrate that he was the best candidate. 'I did
nag Simon to join the company when he was at Warburg. But I know he would
not want to do the top job if there were opposition to it. He has a very
different personality from mine and acts in a very different way.'
Also in the race are the three men recently appointed to the board: Peter
Gershon, who runs GPT, the telecoms business; James Cronin, managing
director of GEC Alsthom power engineering; and Roy Gardner, head of
GEC-Marconi, the electronics arm. The other much-touted contender is David
Newlands, GEC's finance director. If one of the candidates rises above the
others in the eyes of the board and the City, the succession may be smooth.
But the company is not home yet.
There are at least some signs of change at Stanhope Gate. Until recently a
chipboard wardrobe which must have cost all of Pounds 50 at MFI stood in the
corner of the modest waiting room. No-one in living memory had ever hung a
coat in it. Now it has disappeared, though its imprint can still be seen
clearly in the hard-wearing beige carpet. The room has even been painted and
GEC's smart 1960s logo hangs on the wall.
Some things, however, remain the same. Profile writers have always moaned
that no matter how hot the day or how long the interview, they are never
offered refreshments by Weinstock.
They still go thirsty. As I left his office on a sticky July day Lord
Weinstock wished me a speedy journey back to the FT. I explained that the
train strike had emptied the streets - so much so that I had arrived for the
interview 20 minutes early and had gone for a cup of coffee around the
corner.
Lord Weinstock misheard me slightly. 'You got a cup of coffee here?' he
asked, his eyes bulging with astonishment. 'They should do a Bateman cartoon
 -the man who got a cup of coffee at GEC]' Whatever else he lacks at 70, the
custodian of Britain's electrical industry has a finely developed sense of
self-parody.

growing sector of the communications industry over the next five years.
The forecast of annual compound growth of 11.7 per cent to a total of
Dollars 22.3bn by 1998, compared with Dollars 12.8bn last year, comes in the
eighth annual Communications Industry Forecast by Veronis, Suhler, the US
investment bank, published today.
Interactive digital media consists of entertainment and information that is
distributed, or soon will be, in digital form.
John Suhler, president of the investment bank expects growth in of the
interactive media industry 'will continue to be explosive over the next five
years'.
Veronis, Suhler expects the number of on-line households in the US to triple
to 10.5m over the five year forecast period, with subscription spending for
services rising in line from Dollars 407m last year to Dollars 1.5bn in
1998. Spending on educational software is expected to more than double to
Dollars 888m by 1998.
According to the report, consumers will spend Dollars 5.2bn a year by 1998,
buying products from televised home shopping services. This is a 9.6 per
cent average growth rate, although it compares with 13.2 per cent over the
previous five years.
Overall the communications industry will continue to expand in the US, and
spending by both advertisers and consumers on products and services will
reach Dollars 308.5bn by 1998, a compound annual rate of 6.6 per cent over
the next five years.
Advertising spending will grow by no less than 5 per cent in any of the next
five years.
Other highlights from the report include:
Television broadcasting spending to increase to Dollars 34.7bn, with the
erosion of network audiences ending and the networks holding their market
share.
Total radio advertising growth to double at a 7.1 per cent rate over five
years, reaching Dollars 13.2bn by 1998.
Cable spending to reach Dollars 27.4bn, growing at a 4.7 per cent annual
rate.
Total spending on newspapers (advertising and circulation) to total Dollars
60.2bn by 1998 - a 5.9 per cent compound annual rate.
Spending on books to reach Dollars 32bn by 1998 - expanding 7.2 per cent
over the next five years.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Media Futures: Panamsat raises stakes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Panamsat, the private satellite operator which competes with Intelsat,
earlier this month launched the first of three new satellites aboard a
French Ariane rocket from Kourou in French Guiana.
The launch of Panamsat II is a key step in the company's aim to establish
itself as a global operator competing not just with Intelsat, but with
smaller regional satellites such as Astra in Europe.
In November Panamsat II will be followed by Panamsat III, which will cover
the Atlantic, and next April by Panamsat IV, which will cover the Indian
Ocean, acting as a bridge between Europe and Asia.
'The three satellites will give us between six and seven times our existing
capacity,' says Fred Landman, chief operating officer, from Panamsat's
headquarters in Greenwich, Connecticut. 'It will put us in a far stronger
position to erode the hold of Intelsat on this market.'
Panamsat boasts a cast of blue-chip clients, from international telecoms
operators such as KDD of Japan to most of the main US broadcasters. It has
already signed up 12 customers for Panamsat II, although the satellite will
not be operational for another few weeks.
What is the key to Panamsat's appeal? 'We are private enterprise in outer
space,' says Landman. 'We are customer-oriented, and have a rapport with
more than 300 users with specially-tailored services.'
He expects the satellite market 'to explode' in the next two years. 'When we
started as the first private international system in 1986, the world was one
big satellite monopoly. But the telecoms and broadcasting industries upon
which we depend have themselves opened up to greater competition since then,
opening up an array of new opportunities for us.'
Broadcasters account for two-thirds of Panamsat's revenue; the rest comes
from telecoms operators. 'I expect that balance to continue,' says Landman.
He sees significant telecoms opportunities in developing regions - Latin
America, Africa, Eastern Europe, Asia - where fixed infrastructure is either
unavailable or not of sufficient standard to provide the quality of
communications required by the corporate sector.
The total cost of the three satellites will be Dollars 720m. It is a hefty
sum to recoup, particularly with the launch of other private systems such as
Orion. But Panamsat points to a committed investor base, boosted recently by
the Mexican broadcasting company Grupo Televisa SA.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Media Futures: Moose, salmon and fibre-optics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAINT JOHN, NEW BRUNSWICK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
New Brunswick is not the sort of place where one expects to find a Ministry
of State for the Electronic Information Highway. With abundant forests and
waterways, the eastern Canadian province is best known for salmon fishing,
moose hunting, and high tides in the Bay of Fundy.
But if New Brunswick Telephone Co (NBTel) and Northern Telecom, the
Toronto-based telecoms equipment maker, have their way, New Brunswick will
soon gain recognition as a pioneer in the unfolding world of multimedia. The
aforesaid ministry of state, which was created last February, is set to play
a significant supporting role.
Northern and NBTel are partners in a CDollars 300m (Pounds 142m) project
which aims to bring a range of video-on-demand services to 400 homes and to
six schools in Saint John, the province's commercial centre, within the next
12 months, and to 60 per cent of all phone subscribers in the province by
the end of 1998. 'Everything we learn here is going to be used worldwide,'
predicts Clint Colpitts, Northern's manager for New Brunswick. The bulk of
the funds will be used to build a broadband network based on the province's
wholly-digital phone system and an existing fibre-optic network which
connects the main centres.
Northern is the overall project manager and systems integrator. It will also
supply the fibre-optic transmission equipment and the high-capacity
asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switches required for broadband services.
NBTel has gained a reputation as an unusually entrepreneurial utility. All
its 300,000 customers have access to voice mailboxes as part of their basic
phone service. BCE, the Montreal-based telecommunications group which
controls Northern Telecom, also has a 41 per cent stake in NBTel. 'We're
small enough to have ideas and big enough to execute them,' says John
MacDonald, NBTel's chief executive, whose business card includes his
electronic-mail and Internet addresses.
Talks are under way to bring New Brunswick's two main cable-TV companies
into the project. About 83 per cent of the province's homes are already
wired with the coaxial cable required for cable-TV and broadband signals.
Everyone would prefer to avoid the cost of overlapping infrastructures, and
the inconvenience to consumers of two set-top controllers - one for
cable-TV, and the other for multimedia services.
MacDonald likens the ideal broadband system to a single highway or airport
used by competing trucking companies and airlines. He says that 'we're open
to any proposals to accelerate deployment of the network and bring down
costs.' But he adds that 'if we can't come to an accommodation (with the
cable companies), we have to secure our future, and they have to secure
theirs.'
The core of the new multimedia service will initially be a library of
educational videos provided by Magic Lantern Communications, a Toronto-based
distributor.
An electronic shopping mall and a range of government services will also be
available from the start. Viewers will be able to choose which advertisers'
promotions they want to see, and to charge purchases to a credit card using
the interactive service. Northern hopes later to add an 'intelligent agent'
which can be programmed with the shopper's personal profile (size, colour
preferences, and so on) and can search the database for competitive prices.
The inclusion of government services stems from the strong support which
information technology has received from the New Brunswick authorities. The
province's premier, Frank McKenna, is widely regarded as one of Canada's
most forward-looking and sensible politicians. McKenna, who often jokingly
introduces himself as NBTel's vice-president for marketing, has latched on
to the 'information highway' both as a means to attract investment to his
province, and to improve government efficiency.
A pilot project in two towns allows residents to sit at a single computer
terminal to pay property taxes, renew car licences, buy fishing permits, or
apply for a birth certificate. Entrants to the annual lottery for
moose-hunting licences have in the past submitted their bids at a government
office. But this year's 'Moose Draw' was conducted entirely by touch-tone
telephone.
Northern and NBTel are confident they have the technology to meet the
deadlines for their video-on-demand service. They are less sure however,
what services customers will want, and who will pay for them.
The partners have already begun organising focus groups to help determine
the content of their services. A market research or media consultancy may be
brought in for advice.
Services will be charged on a transaction basis, rather than at a flat rate,
such as that used for cable-TV. Northern and NBTel recognise, however, that
viewers may not be thrilled by the idea of paying to enter an electronic
shopping mall or government office.
Much of the financial burden is likely to fall on advertisers and other
businesses, at least in the early stages. Among the ideas being floated is
to refund the fee for opening an electronic shopping catalogue once a
purchase is made. Consumer-oriented businesses, such as McDonald's, the
hamburger chain, could hand out a 'smart card' with every purchase, to be
used, say, for one hour of multimedia viewing.
Content and financing issues raise more questions than answers just now. In
the fast-evolving world of multimedia, there is no guarantee that the
project will be a success. But Northern's Colpitts confidently predicts that
'when the capability is there, all the entrepreneurs and marketers are going
to come out of the woodwork and make this thing hum.'

FT  25 JUL 94 / Media Futures: Post haste for barcoded mail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal Mail is planning to extend to the whole of the UK a scheme - at
present on trial among a number of its larger customers - which promises
dramatically to simplify mail addressing and sorting.
The scheme initially involves adding extra characters to existing postcodes
so that each code will identify a single, unique address.
The nub of the Royal Mail development, however, is the transformation of the
extended postcode into a new kind of barcode which can be read by special
electronic scanners at rates of up to 30,000 items an hour. It is thought
the target for completing the conversion is the early part of next year. The
barcodes will be chiefly of benefit to high volume, bulk mail customers.
Mailsort customers who presort their post already qualify for a 2 per cent
discount for barcoding 30,000 items or more.
Conventional barcodes, widely used on products and packaging in industry and
commerce, comprise printed columns of bars of varying width. These can be
read optically to yield information about the product or contents.
The Royal Mail barcodes are different in form, consisting of patterns of
lines of varying length which can be printed under control from a personal
computer. One advantage is that the barcode reading machines are able to
recognise the pattern despite the presence of, say, advertising materials on
the packaging.
Barry Jeeves, customer barcoding consultant to the Royal Mail, quoted in the
current issue of the magazine PC Week, says the Mail has essentially
developed its own barcode based on an existing US standard. Conventional
barcodes, he says, were not quick enough. There were problems with low
quality printers and materials.
There are some 25m domestic and business addresses in the UK. Existing
postcodes identify a group of about 15 addresses and are adequate for
existing sorting systems, which are based on machine recognition of
phosphorescent dots printed on the packaging. Customer should benefit
greatly from keying in a nine character barcode instead of several lines of
address.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Architecture: Image projector's image - Colin Amery assesses
Channel Four's new building in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Television is everywhere and it is sometimes difficult to imagine it coming
from any specific place. In these days of virtual reality, it comes as a
surprise to realise that TV channels need concrete headquarters and solid
bases for their activities.
Opened earlier this month, the new Channel Four building in Westminster
follows hot on the heels of the new ITN building in London, designed by Sir
Norman Foster. Britons see ITN in all its transparent glory every night on
'News at Ten' - the image of efficiency and focused energy gives a certain
boost of confidence to the broadcasting of the news itself.
When TV-am began its short life in a converted canal-side warehouse in
Camden Town, it chose as its architect the jocular Terry Farrell who could
not resist a sunrise-shaped entrance and a row of breakfast egg cups along
the parapet.
Those jokey days are over and Channel Four took the appointment of its
architect, Sir Richard Rogers, very seriously. Channel Four held a private
competition and appointed a design committee to oversee the process and
select the winner.
The composition of any jury is usually what determines the result and when
you have Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate Gallery, Michael Manser, a
former president of the Royal Institute of British Architects, Michael Grade
and Sir Richard Attenborough on the jury you can expect a fellow member of
the modernist establishment, of a certain age, will be appointed. At the
time of the competition (1991) I recall the much more adventurous scheme, by
Bennetts Associates, which reached the shortlist but did not win.
The winning design by Sir Richard Rogers shows how middle age has tempered
the extremism of his early years when the Pompidou Centre, which he designed
with Renzo Piano, was the first building to expose all its pipes and ducts
on the outside of the facade.
This was seen as some kind of a breakthrough and announced the birth of the
style known as high-tech. As is often the case with the promotion of
architectural styles - a great deal depends on the personal charm of the
architect. Richard Rogers has always been a fervent evangelist and has used
his personal charm to sell his particular brand of mechanistic modernism. It
is interesting to see how he is modifying his line, and in all his public
utterances about community architecture he begins to sound close to some of
the views of HRH The Prince of Wales.
Channel Four's new headquarters occupies two and a half acres on Horseferry
Road in Westminster, just behind the concrete horror of the Department of
the Environment's headquarters in Marsham Street.
The site had been ear marked 20 years ago for a 20 storey post office
building and work had already started on the construction of a ten metre
deep basement. This below-ground work was utilised by the architects to
provide a home for 'no-daylight functions' such as the main studio and the
preview cinema. As part of the planning deal, negotiated by Westminster City
Council, half an acre of the site is a public park and children's
playground.
The plan of the building is a large 'L' shape, with the knuckle of the
building, at the joint of the 'L', being occupied by the curved entrance
area, boardroom, and restaurants. It is this curved element that is the most
spectacular part of the building and is really the only part of the design
that seems to bear Richard Rogers's signature. The curved curtain wall,
supported on a spider's web of steel, is something that all architects have
tried to do since Norman Foster's Willis Faber Dumas office building in
Ipswich curved so sinuously on its site.
It is the component manufacturer who must take much of the credit for the
success of something as striking as Channel Four's curved glass wall. It was
made by Eiffel in France (who made the famous glass pyramid in the Louvre).
Permasteelisa, an Italian cladding manufacturer under the direction of
Massimo Colomban, made the curtain walling on the office blocks which have a
rugged toughness about them. Massimo Colomban is one of those brilliant
Italian designer/businessmen who is currently founding a school to train
architects in the 'perfecting of component engineering'.
Channel Four has really gained a fragment of a Rogers building - the
excitingly curved entrance area and the lift tower and stack of meeting
zooms - the rest of two blocks is routine offices. Indeed, one of the blocks
will be let. Channel Four has spent Pounds 62m on the site and the building.
Construction costs are some Pounds 39m which, allowing for the special needs
of a TVbuilding, is not far from the average for a good quality office block
in central London.
Channel Four has provided London with a modest but striking example of late
modernism - a kind of calmed, high-tech building. The particularly good
thing is that it has stayed in the centre of the city, not gone wandering
off to Docklands and has provided some housing for sale and a park on the
site.
In image terms the new headquarters is much more workmanlike than Lord
Reith's grand Broadcasting House. By concentrating all the architectural
excitement at the entrance, Channel Four's new HQ is rather like TV itself -
it promises a lot of sparkle but, once you pass the entrance the building,
is pretty routine.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Business Travel: Hosts with the most - Chrystia Freeland
offers advice for a trip to Kiev, and says you'll need stamina to cope with
Ukrainian hospitality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Travellers to Kiev need not be too disheartened by Ukraine's dismal
international image. In spite of the dire economic data, you will not starve
in the country that was once the bread-basket of Europe. Neither is there
any need to buy chocolates, cigarettes or perfumes in duty free before you
leave - they are plentiful, and cheaper, in the kiosks lining Kiev's main
streets.
Nor, however, should you expect all the comforts of home. Bring wads of cash
in small, unmarked notes (but beware of keeping it in a money belt, which is
more likely to bring you to the attention of local hoods than offer
protection) and all the toiletries you need, and be prepared for
intermittent hot water.
Arrival at Borispil, Kiev's international airport, offers the business
traveller a useful lesson about Ukraine: the Soviet system is gone, but no
effective mechanism has emerged to take its place.
There is the odd improvement. Entry visas, which once meant standing in long
queues outside Soviet embassies abroad, can now be purchased with relative
ease and often less expense (Dollars 50) at the Ukrainian border (unlike in
neighbouring Russia). However, be prepared to spend a long time waiting in
Kiev's dingy airport. A letter of invitation from a Ukrainian organisation,
while not necessary, often expedites the process.
Foreigners who do not speak fluent Ukrainian or Russian should expect to pay
Dollars 40 to Dollars 50 for a taxi ride to the centre of town. Once a deal
has been struck, Ukrainian cabbies tend to be honest and safe. But you may
find it reassuring to arrange to be met by your hosts at the airport - this,
in any case, is the Ukrainian custom.
The worst part of your visit to Kiev will probably be the accommodation: the
Dnipro and Khreshchatik hotels, on the city's main street, are centrally
located and fairly inexpensive (about Dollars 120 a night), but the rooms
can be dreadful - small, with uncomfortable beds and disintegrating
bathrooms. The Intourist-Rus, on a hill near the centre of the city, is a
bit more comfortable and has fax machines and photocopiers, but the bill is
more than Dollars 200 a night.
If your visit has any connection with a government institution, try to
wangle a room at the National Hotel. Once reserved for high-ranking
communist officials (before independence it was known as the October Hotel,
as in the October Revolution), the National offers a glimpse of the
lifestyle of the ancien regime. The hotel boasts more marble than the
European Bank for Resconstruction and Development in London, and an
abundance of chandeliers. It is safe, comfortable and centrally located.
Unless you have travelled widely in the former Soviet Union or are visiting
Kiev for pleasure, it is best to hire both an interpreter and a driver. Find
the interpreter first (best of all, do so before you arrive), and ask her or
him to negotiate with one of the municipal cab drivers.
The interpreter should cost Dollars 50 to Dollars 70 a day, and the car
about Dollars 40 a day. Businessmen with Moscow offices sometimes bring
their Russian interpreters to Kiev; if possible, it is better to hire
someone local. While almost all Ukrainians speak Russian, most official
functions are conducted in Ukrainian, a language your Russian translator
will only hazily understand.
Ukrainian business etiquette is mysterious, but vital to master. Contracts
are often awarded not to the company which promises a slightly better deal,
but to the people who convince their Ukrainian contacts that they are
basically good guys.
To demonstrate your affable and trustworthy nature, expect to spend a long
time with your Ukrainian counterparts while consuming large quantities of
alcohol and food. The ritual routinely begins at 7 o'clock in the morning
and goes on past midnight. Your reward for holding out on the first day is
to begin the whole process again at sunrise.
Women, who should expect flamboyant hand-kissing and regular comments on
their physical charms, enjoy a rare advantage in this regard. Pleading
feminine delicacy, they can generally avoid the worst of the bacchanalia.
If you are left to fend for yourself, or manage to prise yourself away from
the overwhelming hospitality of your hosts, Kiev has a small but growing
number of fairly decent restaurants. The best pizza is at Arlechino, the
pizzeria in the Nika supermarket-restaurant complex in front of Kiev's main
market. For a more formal, but fairly expensive, meal (about Dollars 40 a
person) try the Apollo, just off Khreshchatyk, the city's main street, or
Del Mario, an Italian restaurant on vulytsia (Ukrainian for street)
Saksahanskoho, not far from the train station.
Tsian Deng, a new and remarkably good Chinese restaurant on Gorky street
about 10 minutes from the centre of town, offers a respite from heavy
Ukrainian food and the homogenised Italian dishes which are the main fare in
Kiev's hard-currency restaurants. A word of warning - leave your Ukrainian
friends at home, since only the most cosmopolitan Kiev palates have
discovered the pleasures of oriental cuisine.
A charming, and surprisingly affordable, way to entertain Ukrainian partners
is by renting one of the boats that cruise the Dnieper, the big river which
bisects Kiev and has been one of Ukraine's main trade arteries for more than
a millennium. To rent a boat for an evening should cost no more than Dollars
500 and groups often take 36-hour cruises up and down the river at about
Dollars 60 a head.
As the moon rises over the river and Kiev's desolate industrial suburbs give
way to a verdant country-side, you might forget about the endless
bureaucracy and unpleasant bathrooms. Don't bring up the contracts, though,
until your party disembarks in Kiev.

Road traffic between Hungary and Austria came to a virtual standstill on
Saturday as Hungarian border guards stepped up passport and customs checks
following a bomb blast in Budapest.
Austrian customs officials said Hungarian border guards were checking the
documents and belongings of every person, regardless of nationality, leaving
and entering the country.
This was creating kilometre-long traffic jams on both sides of the border.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Business Travel: Air freshness
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A study in the August issue of Consumer Reports magazine found that almost a
quarter of commercial flights do not meet a basic standard for air
freshness.
About 25 per cent of flights tested had carbon dioxide levels higher than
1,000 parts per million parts of air - the 'comfort threshold' for
ventilation set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air
Conditioning Engineers.
Although the magazine tested 44 jet models, it cited only two as veering
notably from the average: the Boeing 757, which had comparatively high
carbon dioxide levels - 1,552 ppm in one case - and the Boeing 747-400,
which had comparatively low levels.
The air in most of the planes tested had levels between 500 and 800 ppm.
There were no pronounced differences between airlines.
The problem, according to airline employee unions and researchers, is that
newer model planes recycle as much as half of their ventilation air, instead
of providing 100 per cent fresh air, as older models did.

St Louis, Missouri, has become one of a few US cities to run a train service
from the airport into the city, writes Daniel Green.
The airport is one of the 10 busiest in the US and the city is home to the
Anheuser-Busch brewing giant as well as Monsanto in chemicals and McDonnell
Douglas in aerospace.
Metrolink runs from 5am until past midnight. Its air-conditioned trains run
every eight minutes in peak periods and every 15 minutes at other times. The
journey takes 34 minutes and the fare is just Dollars 1.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Business Travel: US warns against Russian flights
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The US has warned the public not to travel on successors to the Soviet-era
airline Aeroflot. The government had earlier warned its own officials
against travelling on Russian airlines.
David Johnson, a spokesman for the State Department, said no specific
incidents prompted the warning.
The department last Monday made public a notice that the US Embassy in
Moscow had issued to US government officials operating in Russia.
It noted that 'travel within Russia is often unreliable', adding 'domestic
air travellers must often cope with unpredictable schedules and difficult
conditions, including overloading'. The statement said 'government officials
working in Russia are instructed to defer routine air travel'.
It warned that until the US Federal Aviation Administration has completed
its evaluation of the Russian civil aviation system 'only official air
travel deemed important and absolutely necessary to the US government should
be undertaken on Russian air carriers'.
'Private Americans may wish to consider this information when making travel
plans,' the State Department said.
But Johnson stressed air travel on Russian lines by US citizens is not
forbidden.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Working Life: Mail order route to French house design -
Living Space
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Back in 1901, the Ladies Home Journal offered its readers the chance to buy
a house - or rather the architectural plans for a house, designed by Frank
Lloyd Wright, then a rising star of American architecture - for a Dollars 5
fee.
Trois Suisses, the French mail order catalogue, is now following suit by
marketing a mail order house of its own, designed by Philippe Starck, the
superstar French architect, for a slightly more substantial fee of FFr4,900
(Dollars 932).
Starck is the man who sold half a million lobster-shaped lemon squeezers for
Alessi and whose design flair turned the Royalton and the Century Paramount
into the hippest hotels in Manhattan. His mail order house has only been on
the market since June but, judging by the first flurry of orders, seems set
to be another success.
The house, says Starck, is the 'type of place I wanted to live in as a
child, but didn't' It is a simple wooden construction on two floor with
windows and a verandah all around, that looks like a modernist mixture of a
Chinese pagoda and a Russian dacha.
Starck has built his own version of the house in a forest on the outskirts
of Paris. His 'leettle 'ut in the woods' appears in the Trois Suisses
catalogue. It looks stunning. His original Charles Eames chairs and fin de
siecle Venetian mirrors help: but even without them it is easy to see the
appeal of the artisanal wooden facade and of the clear, bright rooms with
light streaming through the windows.
Trois Suisses reckons that it would cost FFr1.1m to build the house with the
verandah and FFr850,000 without. The only hitch is that, so far, it has only
cleared the design with the French planning authorities. Anyone who fancies
recreating Chez Starck in another country will have to begin by battling
with the bureaucrats.

<TEXT>
The surprising thing about packing a holiday suitcase is that the formula
hardly changes from year to year.
The more practised you become the less likely you are to take dozens of
things that never get worn. There are certain rules which always apply to a
two-week sunshine holiday. The first is you never need anything that dressy
(and that includes jewellery). The second, that it helps to keep your
clothes in a choice of two or three colours. (Black and white being the most
obvious).
A formal evening dress with stockings and stilettos looks somewhat
out-of-place, even banal, in a mediterranean setting. You can tell a
practised traveller by the way she saunters out to dinner in a white t-shirt
and white trousers, accessories consisting merely of a pair of strappy
silver sandals and a few brush strokes of bronzer on her cheeks.
The summer sales in Britain are full of floral viscose dresses (short and
long) which can be dressed up (those silver sandals) or down with a t-shirt
underneath and espadrilles. Look for the Ghost label (Whistles, Harrods,
Liberty) and you will find the perfect weight fluid viscose crepe in simple
solid colour dresses, elasticated waist trousers and long line,
loose-fitting tunic tops. Flyte Ostell (A la Mode and Liberty) and Betty
Jackson (311 Brompton Road) are designers with a similar philosophy.
Do you really need shorts? Yes, if you plan to play tennis and other
athletic pursuits. No, unless you buy shorts that are tailored to flatter
(Calvin Klein at Selfridges, Levis or Emporio Armani). A sarong skirt, or
piece of patterned fabric (for glamour you can use a large Hermes silk
scarf) tied round a swimsuit and knotted at the waist is far more stylish as
an alternative. Cooler too.
Always plan to take items which double as something else, like the silk
scarf that can be worn as a hairband, over the head if visiting a church or
as a mini sarong - even as a bedspread if you hate the rented villa
furnishings.
Classic shirts always present an ironing problem which is why simple
tank-style swimsuits, which work as bodies for the day, are far less like
hard work.
Glamourous plunge-neck styles (black is always best) can double as an
evening top. The brave can take this years' three-triangle bikini because at
least it takes up no packing space.
Shoes are the most bulky item, but the way they transform the image of an
outfit is paramount.
That crease-resistant viscose dress says one thing worn with trainers,
another when with espadrilles and changes further with delicate strappy
sandals. Good sunglasses with Polaroid lenses, a sunhat that will survive
the journey, and a bag which works for the beach and the market and doesn't
look like the formal leather one you take to the office are all intelligent
investments.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Working Life: Classic way to cut driving costs - Finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Come the summer and out come cars which are usually kept lovingly polished
in the garage and away from the rain. Vintage Jaguars, classic Alfa Romeos
and peak condition Jensens are as much a part of the traffic in the summer
as newer Toyotas and Fords, except that their drivers look as if they are
enjoying themselves more.
If you are waiting for August 1 to buy your new M registered car, think
again. Classic cars are not only beautiful; they also offer a rare
combination of luxury while saving their drivers money.
Like property and fine art, classic cars were another of those 1980s
'overvalued' assets. Prices have fallen, which is good news for someone
considering buying one now. One advantage is that, through careful choice, a
classic car could cut your company car tax bill.
The new system of company car tax which came into effect in April, is based
on the list price of the car. Employees pay tax on 35 per cent of the
manufacturer's list price of the car when new, plus the price of any
accessories and value added tax. One concession is that the list price is
reduced by one-third for company cars which are four or more years old at
the end of the tax year.
Forget classic cars which are worth more than Pounds 15,000 (and which are
over 15 years old) - they will be taxed on their open market value.
However, Maurice Parry-Wingfield of accountant Touche Ross points out that
if the car is worth less than Pounds 15,000 and is over four years old, the
benefit will be taxed according to the original car price and then reduced
by one-third because of the car's age: 'For less than Pounds 15,000 there
are many commendable vehicles available. Who would balk at, say, a 1978
Mercedes 350SL convertible which has a list price of a relatively paltry
Pounds 12,500 and a value in the region of Pounds 13,500?' he says.
A higher-rate taxpayer choosing this car would pay Pounds 1,167 in tax, less
than half the amount they would have to pay - Pounds 2,492 - on a Mazda MX5
1.8i S, which has an original list price of Pounds 17,800. Although the
Merc's running costs may be higher than for a new car, Parry-Wingfield
points out that one of the biggest costs when running a car is depreciation
and, since the depreciation on the Mazda is likely to outstrip that on the
Mercedes, the saving should offset any increase in running costs.
Even if you are not choosing a company car but want to buy one for your
private use, a classic car still retains an important advantage, in terms of
lower insurance premiums, over other cars. Some motor insurers are prepared
to charge lower rates as long as the car is old (usually over 15 years) and
not driven too frequently. The most common mileage band is for a maximum of
3,000 miles a year, although some policies allow up 6,000 miles.
There are a number of specialist insurers and brokers, including Norwich
Union which has a Collectors' Vehicles policy (0603 622200); John Scott and
partners (0252 725555), KGM Motor Policies (081 530 7351); Hall &amp; Clarke
(081 908 5611) and Bain Clarkson (0384 455011).

FT  25 JUL 94 / Working Life: Federal - Buzzword
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the EU is not converging, its terms of abuse are. As the battle raged
between 'anti-federalist' and 'arch-federalist' last month, Jacques Santer,
Commission President elect, was recast as a 'non-entity' by the UK press,
translated by El Pais, the Spanish newspaper, as 'un don nadie' (17 July).
Federal means 'government in which two or more states constitute a political
unity while remaining more or less independent with regard to their internal
affairs' (OED). That, especially the 'more or less' part, leaves scope for
debate. The word derives from latin fidere (to trust) and foedus (treaty);
the Latin foederatus means 'bound by treaty'. The word evolved into the
medieval French federation and then into English.
Federalism has become a label applied by nationalistic British Conservatives
to anyone who believes in European convergence or the ceding of power to
Brussels.
'Spot the federalist' has become one of the main pastimes of British
euro-sceptics. Anyone tarred with the federalist brush is deemed
untrustworthy by the British right wing though scant attention is paid to
what the term means.
So last month's search to replace Jacques Delors turned upon whether the
candidate was regarded merely as a 'federalist', a 'centralising federalist'
(Jean Luc-Dehaene, the initial candidate) or a 'decentralising federalist'
(Santer's variety, according to John Major).
Why is federalist, for a British Conservative, a term of abuse, but often a
term of approval for many Continental Europeans or Americans?
Federalism stems from the US and France in the 18th century. It has European
roots but an American upbringing. Strictly it dates from the 1780s in
America under Washington, Adams and Madison, creators of the US governance.
The latter wrote in Federalist Papers: 'The powers delegated by the
Constitution to the federal government are few and defined' (26 January,
1788). The architecture of the period (1780-1800) is even known as
Federalist.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Sport: Keep betting in the dark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1961, the year that murderous upheaval in South Africa was putting the
country beyond the pale as far as liberal democracy - and, later, cricket -
was concerned, a small social upheaval was taking place in Britain. On May 1
the first legal betting shops were opened, and a message was printed on the
cover of the Sporting Life from Home Secretary Rab Butler to all those who
were waiting, in their metaphorical traps, for their first race to the
bookmaker. Within its dry paragraphs, Butler's statement conceded that
off-course gambling had become so rife it could no longer be ignored. 'The
old law had fallen into disrepute' - yes indeed, what with policemen
directing likely lads to the nearest illegal betting shop, and informing
street bookmakers, via a manly and bribe filled handshake, that later that
day they might be arrested. The Betting and Gaming Act was a sensible and
adult piece of legislation, which admitted the existence of certain,
helpfully improper, human impulses and which, by admitting them, ensured
that they did as little harm as possible.
Of course, the first betting shops did not set themselves up next door to
Harrods and proclaim their trade with decorative shop window displays. They
were legal, but they still had the aspect of something illegal; they were
covert chambers, made puritanically uncomfortable in order that people
should not be tempted to linger in them.
And yet by 1968 there were over 15,000 of these murky little places. Today
around Pounds 4bn a year is gambled off-course on horse racing, and around
Pounds 1.6bn a year on greyhounds (as well as all those other bets on
whether, say, England will ever win another test match.) Of the 10 per cent
tax that is paid on these bets, the Treasury receives 7.75 per cent: the
government that gave grudging life to the first betting shops also gave to
its successors a magnificent annual present.
In 1986 the importance of gambling was again acknowledged when legislation
was passed allowing betting shops a tentative entry into the smart, spry,
designer world of the late 1980s. They were permitted to serve refreshments,
which encouraged people to stay in them for hours at a time, and to show
live races on television (previously, punters had stared at the wall and
listened to a stream of consciousness voice-over, which passed with surreal
ease between Red Rum's third Grand National win and the 3.36 at Hackney
Wick).
The shops also began to install carpets and shiny frontages and smooth
lighting. Some of them became very comfortable indeed. Behind their darkened
windows lay what was, for many, the perfect living room: coffee, cigarettes,
a seat in front of your favourite TV programme and a feeling, even during
the hours when the world around you was at its busiest, of absolute
seclusion from that world.
And, for all the agreeable physical changes that have been wrought upon
betting shops, it is in that unchanging sense of seclusion that their
attraction truly resides: that sense of apartness from the bright streets in
which people walk with no knowledge of the gamblers' contrived, complicated
and personal communion with the future. Outside the betting shop, into which
daylight never intrudes, what do those people in the real world know of the
alternative world that the gambler has fabricated for himself?
What do they, with their one Grand National bet a year, know of the terrible
hope placed in that horse running at Lingfield, the one that showed such
improvement last time out, the one that the gambler has singled out as his
horse and that will maybe infuse him with emotions that soar and rampage and
have little, in the end, to do with the desire to win money? What do they
know of the gamblers' world, of its rigid codes of behaviour, of its
addictive rhythms, its terse camaraderie, its supreme pointlessness, its
powerful reality?
For all of us, life is an attempt to control our fate within the
unpredictability of its existence. But the gambler does this in his own way:
a way that is compressed, dramatised, specialised and, above all, intensely
private, because it is he who chooses the arena within which he will battle
against the odds.
This privacy, or self-containment, is something that he relishes. That is
not because he is ashamed, but because he is actually rather proud. And if
he wants to keep his gambling hidden behind the darkened windows of the
betting shop, then he should be able to do so.
However, the government has decided that it is time to dabble again in
betting shop legislation, and has advised that the occluded glass which
separates gamblers from the world outside should be replaced with something
cheerily transparent. It is a ridiculous idea, partly connected with the
contemporary urge to sweep all atmosphere out of every institution; but
mainly concerned with getting more people into betting shops by attempting
to conceal the difference between gamblers and non-gamblers.
That is an impossible thing to do. My prediction is that the bright new
betting shops will lose more customers than they attract. The day that I
walk into Ladbrokes to find that the shrewd, squint-eyed old boys have gone
home to watch Teletext and do their business over the phone, and the place
is full of women sipping tea and placing Pounds 2 each way on Housewives
Choice, ridden by Lester Piggott, is the day I shall know the late 20th
century has destroyed yet another of its links with a more fascinating past.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Working Life: Biographies for the beach - Reading Matter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER ASPDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For those considering recent biographies for a good summer read, a spate of
lives of French literary masters should provide some predictably
intoxicating blends of art, sex and money.
Graham Robb's Balzac (Picador), the first English biography on this subject
for 50 years, tells the splendid tale of the author who coldly calculated
that 'each night of love cost half a volume', an equation which did not
disturb his contemporary Stendahl who, according to his biographer Jonathan
Keates (Stendahl, Sinclair Stevenson), boasted of his sexual exploits by
marking the dates of his conquests on his braces.
Moving on a few decades, but still in the same spirit of restless decadence,
Joanna Richardson's Baudelaire (John Murray) tells the tragi-comic story of
the improvident youth who inherited a fortune at 21, only to blow much of it
on an exotic mistress who gave him the syphilis from which he died; there
are parallels with Mallarme, who, according to Gordon Millan's account
(Mallarme: A Throw of the Dice, Secker &amp; Warburg), also failed to reconcile
his tormented existence with the radiant purity of his poetry.
But who needs 19th century French glamour and scandal when there remains a
Kennedy to write about? Joe McGinniss's The Last Brother, the Rise and Fall
of Teddy Kennedy (Little, Brown and Company) observes that the man who was
probably never fit for presidential office in the first place was further
and fatally handicapped by the guilt-driven revenge of the American press
who belatedly recognised their inadequacies in exposing the foibles of
Teddy's elder brothers.
It is a long way from the quiet, unsophisticated life of Joseph Chamberlain.
Peter T. Marsh's astute life (Joseph Chamberlain: Entrepreneur in Politics,
Yale University Press) sees Chamberlain at the centre of many of the 19th
century's greatest social reforms, but denied the ultimate prize of prime
ministerial office in Britain by his errors of judgment and changes of mind
 -the archetypal politician of great influence but little power.
Another forgotten man in need of rehabilitation is Giuseppe Mazzini, the
neglected theorist of Italy's Risorgimento. Denis Mack Smith's eponymous
volume (Yale University Press) attempts to redress the balance of praise
which has usually been lavished more unreservedly on the more glamorous
Cavour and Garibaldi. Any man who manages to be admired by both John Stuart
Mill and Friedrich Nietzsche . . .
The outstanding biography of the last few months is Lyndall Gordon's
Charlotte Bronte: A Passionate Life (Chatto and Windus), a radical
reappraisal of a woman more often seen as a waif whose timid genius was
destroyed by years of hardship; Gordon instead offers a portrait of a fierce
survivor who managed, unlike her sisters, 'to die with human love on her
lips'.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Management: Zil's two-way stretch - The successful
restructuring of the Russian flagship company could act as a catalyst for
change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bit by bit, Russian reform is ceasing to be a matter of exclusively
macro-economic and political consideration and is being devolved to the
enterprises and to their managements. The changes which Russian managers
must now usher in dwarf, in their scale, anything likely to face their
western counterparts. But if Russia is to succeed, these western
counterparts will be increasingly drawn into the great drama which surrounds
the integration of Russia into the world economy.
Privatisation has passed through its first stage - in which almost three
quarters of the state property were pushed out, higgledy piggledy, into
private hands through the medium of privatisation vouchers issued free to
every citizen. A second stage, the period of strategic investment and
company restructuring, is set to begin. Within this process, there is a
small group of massive, flagship companies where a successful restructuring
would act as a catalyst for change far beyond their own limits.
One such is Zil, the Zavod Imena Ligacheva or Factory Named after Ligachev
(its founder) - once called Zis, or the Factory Named after Stalin. It gave
its name to the vast limousines built since the 1920s for the state and
party elite; it was the biggest lorry producer in the former Soviet Union;
it produced small,top-of-the-range buses; it made a wide range of
engineering products for other plants; it had a large, white-goods division.
Says Alexander Vladislyavlev, its present chairman: 'It got the best, the
cream of the Soviet engineers; it got the best equipment. When the state
decided to set up another big truck plant (Kamaz, in Tatarstan) Zil
engineers went out and did it.'
It was politically privileged and untouchable. Its long-serving director,
Yevgeny Brakov, was a member of the Central Committee of the Communist
Party. In his office next to the Zil museum, where the steady progress of
the enterprise from workshop production to vast combine was displayed, he
was first among the country's industrial barons. He was sure of the first
call on resources, his products were on every state farm, in every army
division, in many homes - and beneath the bottoms of the Politbureau members
as they were whisked to and from the Kremlin.
Its crash has paralleled that of the Soviet Union and in its own way is as
spectacular. The writing might have been on the wall when Brakov was put up
by the party to oppose the upstart renegade Boris Yeltsin, when the latter
ran for the Moscow deputy's seat in the USSR Supreme Soviet elections of
March 1989 - and received 392,633 votes against Yeltsin's 5,118,745: it was
an early sign that the Party-state web, without which Zil had no meaning,
was beginning to unravel.
With the ending of the Soviet Union in December 1991, the tolling of the
bell for Zil grew louder. It suffered from the 1992 cuts in the defence
budget - nearly half its trucks went to the military. It suffered as
agricultural subsidies were hit - the other half went largely to the state
and collective farms. People bought fewer fridges, as more and more of their
disposable incomes went to buy the produce which went inside them. The
government tended to buy from Mercedes, and the nouveau riche would rather
be seen dead than in a Zil (which do, indeed, make good hearses). By 1993,
the crisis was upon it.
Instead of restructuring, Brakov went back to his Bolshevik roots: in early
1994, with many of his workers part-time and their pay dropping, he
encouraged them to picket the White House (government offices) to demand
state aid. His point was partly taken - though it did him no good. Both the
federal government and the Moscow City government became alarmed. Zil was
just too big, too well known, too prestigious to go belly up. It was the
equivalent of Chrysler, of Rolls Royce. The market could not be allowed to
decide its fate.
From the latter half of 1993, Russian ministers began voicing concern about
Zil: Alexander Shokhin, the deputy premier for economics, used a visit to
Washington to ask the International Finance Corporation to get involved. The
European Bank of Reconstruction and Development was also coaxed in. Yuri
Luzhkov, the Moscow mayor began to exercise the rights and responsibilities,
which a 25 per cent stake held by Moscow City Council following
privatisation gave him. He promised to assist and did so by taking over the
500,000sq m of apartments it owned - and with these the kindergartens, the
rest homes and the cultural and leisure facilities it ran.
But this kind of relief was a palliative. The change had to come from within
 -and at the top. Following government pressure and behind-the-scenes
dealing, Zil's main shareholders - Moscow City Council, AMO Bank, the
Mikrodin finance group and its workers and managers (who hold 40 per cent of
the shares) - gathered in Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium and elected a new board
of directors with Vladislyavlev (representing the Moscow City Council) as
chairman.
Vladislyavlev is a man of power. A former member of the Central Committee,
his post-Soviet career has been built up in tandem with that of Arkady
Volsky, head of the Russian Industrialists Union, whose deputy he is (Volsky
was once the leader of the Communist Youth League, or Komsomol, in Zil).
Now, he says he is focused on being a company chairman - and doctor.
As the international financiers who are now huddled round Zil attest, he has
moved with speed. In doing so, he has demonstrated the mixture of
flamboyance, use of Soviet-era connections, partial grasp of current
management practice and inside-government horse trading which is bound to be
reproduced in other big Russian restructurings.
First, Vladislyavlev capitalised on what was already partly in place. The US
companies Caterpillar and Paccar, keen to enter the Russian market, had
already moved to form joint ventures. Caterpillar had created a joint
venture to make fuel systems, and is interested in joint production of
trucks through its joint venture Novotruck and engines through a similar
entity, Novodiesel; Paccar is to make heavy trucks with Novodiesel engines.
Talks are also going on with General Motors and Renault. Zil offers these
companies an existing manufacturing base for joint ventures.
Next, he is constructing a structure where the monolithic combine will be
split up. A holding company is being created, which will wholly or partly
own subsidiary companies - of which Zil Manufacturing will retain the
engineering heart of the enterprise, and other divisions will service and
market the products. He has formed an international marketing alliance with
the Avtotraktor export group, which has rather moribund subsidiaries abroad
and which still retains, he says, a core of professional staff.
Soon after his election as chairman, Vladislyavlev moved Brakov aside - he
is now a vice-president in charge of marketing - and promoted Valery Saikin,
a production man, as general director. The promotion of middle managers to
senior positions - he says they are 'the best people available in Russia, in
the first class' - is going ahead.
His flamboyance and imagination shows in his willingness to complement the
deals with foreign partners with the appointment of a high-profile
'consultant'. Currently he is trying to secure the services of Lee Iacocca,
the former Chrysler chairman, among others. 'They should come here and teach
the people in Zil what they know. We need a special institute for teaching
marketing and sales. Zil never had to sell anything before.'
Vladislyavlev has also used his pull within government. He has secured
promises of off-budget support and tax breaks and is arguing strongly (as
did the previous management) for increased tariffs to protect the Russian
car industry. The government, anxious for the flagship, has committed itself
to assisting the continuation and upgrading of the gas guzzlers. They will
order 24 each year, and put up some Dollars 70m (Pounds 45m) a year for
remodelling.
This, the 'masterplan', is still sketchy and raw, still being developed.
Vladislyavlev and the Russian government are pushing hard, trying to
persuade the international financial institutions to commit money, make
connections. He has won admiration for his bustle and energy. But will it
work?
The doubts centre round the sheer size of the task of restructuring and the
political risk attendant on getting it wrong. Zil is, as Vladislyavlev says,
a supreme product of the Soviet era. Shorn of any marketing or finance
skills, it has to acquire a new culture from scratch. Its lorry design is
archaic (they are still petrol driven) and its once captive markets wholly
or partially destroyed. The International Finance Corporation, which helped
restructure Skoda in the Czech Republic (a large but still easier task), is
hesitant; so is the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
'What they need is a white knight which would take the job of restructuring,
put in some of their own money and tough out the opposition. But this is so
high risk I don't see that coming,' says one senior official - speaking, as
almost everyone does on this touchy issue, on grounds of anonymity.
There is also some question as to why the two Russian finance companies, AMO
Bank and Mikrodin, will not put up the required cash for restructuring. Here
one sees a now familiar problem: foreign finance asks why it should invest
if the Russians are withholding, while the Russian companies, unsure of the
nature of the risk, watch foreigners to see where they will invest before
committing their own funds. And Zil waits.
Yet Vladislyavlev, with a good international contacts book and the ambition
to 'make sure my grandson, who loves to work with his hands, will work in
Zil when it is a great Russian company selling to the world', continues to
push its claims.
He is offering 10 per cent of the stock (whether existing shares or a new
issue is not clear) to a large international finance house for Dollars 60m,
with a seat on the board thrown in - a price which, as another international
finance official says, 'is either a tremendous bargain if it can be saved or
a complete waste of money if it can't'.
Russian restructuring is still in the realms of faith. Investment is
increasing: a few manufacturers, led by Percy Barnevik of ABB Brown Boveri,
are leading the column of western investment into working plants. Everyone,
from Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, down, trumpets success over
the horizon. A successful management revolution at Zil would bring the
horizon much closer.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Management: Desert Island Manager - Max Hastings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Max Hastings, editor-in-chief of The Telegraph Group, would be happy to swap
his Isle of Dogs office for a desert island. A country lover at heart,
working in London is the bane of his life.
Who would you take with you?
Jeremy Deedes, Bill Deedes' son who is editorial director. Jeremy is my
nanny and I rely on him not to do anything foolish. I can't think of
anything he would like less than to be stuck on a desert island with me, but
about three times a day I run into Jeremy's office saying 'crisis, Baldrick,
crisis'.
An additional office item, along with a phone and fax?
I'd be lost without a word processor. When I was a teenager and bored in the
summer holidays my father would often talk of the challenge of a blank piece
of paper. I didn't understand what he meant then, but I do now. But like
most modern journalists I can't do it with a pen and paper any more.
Would management from an island work?
I would use the fax a lot. The editor I worked for longest and I most
respected was Charles Wintour on the Evening Standard. Charles was a great
one for rule by abrupt memo and in some ways I mimic his memo style - both
the nice ones and the nasty ones.
Confined to an island, what would you miss?
The stimulus of seeing an enormous number of people. At weekends when I
don't see people one complains of the phone always ringing, but then one
thinks what would it be like if the phone didn't ring.
What wouldn't you miss?
London. One of the highest prices one pays for doing a job like this is
having to work in an office in London. Canary Wharf certainly has nothing to
do with civilisation as far as I understand it.
What would you take to read?
At the very least I'd ask to take the complete Trollope.
Something to drink?
A few cases of wine. For the first six months that I was editor of The Daily
Telegraph I never drank at lunchtime. These days I'd rather suffer the
consequences of having a drink then. When I go to lunch and see everyone
having Perrier I don't feel jealous. I think it has become a reverse
virility symbol.
And to eat?
I'm an unashamed carnivore. I'd like the fishing that I could do on the
island but I'd be sorry if I couldn't have meat anymore.
Would you survive on an island?
Living rough never bothered me. I spent 15 years roaming around the world's
wildernesses as foreign correspondent and was fine. I would also do some
preparation. My father was cast away on a desert island by a Sunday
newspaper and became ill with scurvy and nearly died. He hadn't done proper
research.
You can take just one newspaper
The Daily Mail. It is very entertaining and professionally run. I'd also
want the Spectator and Country Life to see what is happening to house
prices.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Management: When tears are good for business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Roger Fernley heard that the bid for London Transport's advertising arm
had been referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, he wept. Far
from feeling embarrassed about his outburst, the managing director of
British Transport Advertising wrote to the FT last week and told us all
about it. I was so surprised to read his letter that I phoned him up to ask
whether this was his idea of a joke. On the contrary, he said, he had been
angry, incredulous and disappointed, and had shed real tears.
In so doing, he broke the ultimate corporate taboo. I have just done some
research into tears in business and found barely a wet eye anywhere. Robert
Maxwell was constantly sobbing, but then he was always a law unto himself.
It is said that Freddie Laker was close to tears when Laker Airways
collapsed and that Sir Kenneth Berrill had a lump in his throat when he
failed to be reappointed as chairman of the SIB. I have also heard that
Michael Green of Carlton was damp eyed in the 1980s on discovering that he
had lost the BSB contract. But all of these tales are years out of date, few
and far between, and none amounts to a good public weep.
There are examples of grown men blubbing openly in politics and sports,
often to advantage. Bob Hawke, the former Australian PM, greatly increased
his popularity by sobbing over everything from domestic difficulties to the
massacre in Tiananmen Square.
Even more famously, Paul Gascoigne, the footballer, showed himself to be a
human being when he broke down on receiving a yellow card in the 1990 World
Cup.
But businessmen? Never. The only time they seem to cry is when seriously
frustrated: when they have missed an aeroplane, or cannot make a foreign
bureaucrat do as they want. Earlier this month I saw an executive in black
tie close to tears at Victoria station having learnt that trains to
Glyndebourne were not running.
By shedding these sort of impotent tears, businessmen look foolish. By
contrast, to cry at critical moments in a company's history could add a
certain something to the occasion and might encourage others to be more
understanding.
It would, of course, be intolerable if executives cried at the smallest
setback. Displays of emotion can be a form of manipulation - and there is
enough of that in office life already. But on big occasions tears could be
called for. If Graham Hearne of Enterprise Oil had wept on losing the battle
for Lasmo, people might have been sympathetic rather than carping away about
how he must drop one of his posts as chairman or chief executive. Fernley's
tears may not influence those hard-hearted pen pushers in the DTI and at the
MMC. But they show he is a human being who is not afraid to admit as much.
It has only just been drawn to my attention that Harrods, the tourist
attraction in Knightsbridge, does not let shoppers in to buy its pricey
goods unless they are suitably dressed. On the face of it, this seems a
bizarre policy. Surely Harrods knows that the customer is king, and that
those in shorts and vests deserve the same fawning service as ones in suits
and designer frocks? It is all very well for pubs to specify no work
clothes, as they do not want souvenirs from the building site on their
upholstery. But a pair of designer jeans with a rip on the knee does not
hurt anyone.
I now see this is a naive reaction. Harrods has explained to me that lady
customers were offended by 'sweaty hairy men with their armpits or crotches
on display'. The store also pointed that something urgent had to be done
given that 'shopping at Harrods is the most pleasurable thing that many of
our customers do all week'.
Leaving that remarkable assertion to one side, Harrods is on to something.
The image of a business is dependent not just on its own actions, but on the
customers it attracts. Just as shops can reasonably tell customers not to
smoke, they should also be able to insist on any other standards they see
fit. If people do not like it they can always take their custom elsewhere.
The fact that Harrods' dress code has been greeted with such suspicion shows
that the customer-is-always-right mentality has gone too far. Sometimes the
customer is a damn nuisance and I admire the companies that do not stand for
it.
Well done also to Standard Chartered for its fine and upstanding declaration
that it will withdraw from any country that relies on bribes or unethical
business practice. I shall be fascinated to see how it gets on. The bank
does business in a long list of countries where I had always thought large
and small backhanders were part of the cost of being there. If Standard
Chartered stays in those places, that will be proof that stories of
corruption are overdone or out of date. Alternatively, it just could mean
that no such international operation should make sweeping declarations of
that kind and hope to live by them.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Insurer told to test staff competence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The salesforce of Royal Insurance, one of the largest insurance companies,
will tomorrow sit examinations to assess their professional competence at
the request of Lautro, the industry's regulator.
Royal Insurance's decision to re-test its 1,000-strong salesforce on their
knowledge of products and the financial services market follows a visit by
Lautro in May, which found weaknesses in the company's training schemes.
Lautro, which will run further checks in the autumn, asked Royal Insurance
to re-assess its salesforce and strengthen its supervisory programmes.
Mr Don Shore, deputy managing director of Royal Life, the group's life arm,
said: 'They wanted us to get an up-to-date knowledge of the strengths and
weaknesses of the salesforce.'
He said that the request to speed up the company's reassessment programme
reflected weaknesses in the training scheme rather than problems with the
salesforce. There had been no suggestion of aggressive or misleading sales
practices, he said.
Mr Shore said that he did not expect many to fail the examinations as the
staff had all passed similar tests last year.
Royal Insurance's move highlights increased vigilance by regulators about
standards of selling in the life insurance and pensions industry. The
industry has been accused of using high-pressure sales techniques to
persuade customers to buy unsuitable products.
Barclays Life, the life insurance and pensions subsidiary of Barclays Bank,
was publicly rebuked last week by the Securities and Investments Board, the
City watchdog, for shortcomings in the training and management of its
salesforce.
Nationwide Building Society also announced last week that it was temporarily
withdrawing its financial services salesforce for retraining. The move
followed a routine visit by Lautro.
In March Norwich Union, one of the largest insurers, suspended its entire
life and pensions salesforce for a month after Lautro identified
shortcomings in management controls.
The controversy about the industry's standards of selling appears to have
affected sales. Recent figures from the Association of British Insurers
showed that sales of single-premium personal pensions dropped sharply in the
first quarter of the year.

FT  25 JUL 94 / CBI survey fuels 'short-termism' debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the Confederation of British Industry's investment appraisal survey comes
out today, the main topic engaging the analysts is how far it might explain
the elusive nature of UK business investment.
For the evidence that many companies are setting high hurdles - minimum
rates of return - for investment projects has given new statistical input to
the debate about the alleged 'short-termism' of UK businesses.
On one side of the debate stands Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank
of England, who has repeatedly criticised businesses in recent months for
failing to adjust to low inflation.
By demanding high rates of return on investment, the argument goes,
businesses are fuelling inflationary expectations and stifling viable
investment projects.
On the other side of the line, however, stand many City analysts and
businesspeople. They argue not only that companies are right to be cautious
about inflation in light of past events, but that inflation expectations are
not the only factor holding back business investment.
Mr Kevin Gardiner, economist at US investment bank Morgan Stanley, said:
'These concerns do not reflect business realities. High hurdles are the most
economic way of weeding out weak projects.'
The debate has taken on particular urgency, given that investment is lagging
behind other parts of the recovery. The CBI's previous industrial trends
survey, in April, suggested investment would rise only modestly this year,
and its next quarterly report, issued tomorrow, is not expected to change
this scenario significantly.
Today's survey is unlikely to settle the debate either way, not least
because it suggests that companies employ a hotch-potch of methods for
appraising investment.
Of the 438 companies surveyed, about 90 per cent were found to use
quantitative ways to evaluate investment, based on three main methods.
The most popular was the 'pay-back' method, which assesses a project in
terms of how soon a company can recoup its investment. However, a
significant proportion, particularly among the larger companies, used more
sophisticated calculations based on nominal and real 'rates of return' and
'cashflow', often in combination.
Of those which used the pay-back method, only 14 per cent used a pay-back
period of five years or more.
Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, recently announced it was lengthening its
pay-back period by two years in light of low inflation. In spite of this,
two-thirds of companies have not adjusted their pay-back period to the new
conditions, the survey found.
Among those companies using rates of return, the picture was more mixed.
About two-fifths of those using nominal rates of return said their hurdle
rate was above 20 per cent. Surprisingly, a similar proportion of those
using real rates also employed a 20 per cent hurdle.
Meanwhile, only a third of investors using real rates of return said their
hurdle rate was 8 per cent to 11 per cent, while 28 per cent using nominal
rates said they used hurdles of 11 per cent or less.
However, only a third of the companies using nominal rates based these on
explicit inflation forecasts - for which the average was an annual rate of 5
per cent. But other factors such as profit growth, risk and the opportunity
cost of capital also affected nominal hurdle rates. Significantly, interest
rate expectations were considered less important.
The Bank of England and the Treasury's own verdict from these findings is,
unsurprisingly, that companies need to adjust to the new environment.
The Treasury said: 'Ministers have made clear their determination to deliver
the government's inflation target, and if companies assume higher inflation
they will miss out on construction and investment opportunities.'
Yet Professor Elroy Dimson, professor of finance at London Business School,
suggested that the finding that most companies calculated rates of return on
a pre-tax basis might paint an excessively negative picture. A pre-tax rate
of return of 20 per cent, for example, might correspond to a post-tax hurdle
of only 13 per cent, he said.
He added: 'One reason for these high hurdles may be that businesses simply
do not have a lot of investment projects.'

FT  25 JUL 94 / Switch to foreign banks reported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dissatisfaction with UK banks has led to many British companies switching to
foreign banks during the past 18 months, a study says today.
The analysis of 243,000 companies by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the broker,
says foreign banks have increased their market share by about 10 per cent.
Yet it finds that the rate of switching slowed in the first half of this
year.
Not only have foreign banks gained strongly, but they have attracted a
slightly higher proportion of low-risk companies, measured by credit
quality.
The analysis of companies in business-information group Dun &amp; Bradstreet's
corporate database is the first to measure the practical effect of
complaints about standards of bank service from small companies during the
past two years. However, the study points out that only about 2 per cent of
companies change banks each year.
Barclays lost most, with a net 1,591 companies leaving. Lloyds lost the
biggest proportion - 2.8 per cent of its corporate customers.
National Westminster Bank was a very small gainer of both high-risk and
low-risk companies. Royal Bank of Scotland and Bank of Scotland were net
gainers of low-risk companies, with Royal Bank of Scotland also losing
high-risk companies. Midland lost a net 232 customers in the first half of
last year, falling to 69 in the second, and 48 in the first six months of
this year.
Barclays stood out in all three half-years as the largest net loser of
customers.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Guide on pension payouts delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The final version of guidance on how to compensate investors who have
suffered from poor advice on personal pensions is unlikely to be available
until the autumn, about three months behind schedule.
The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, is expected
to announce this week its plans for pressing ahead with the guidelines for
life companies and independent financial advisers, while conceding that the
original timetable has slipped.
Public concern about the possible mis-selling of personal pensions to
customers transferring or opting out of occupational schemes erupted last
December.
Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman, said then that all those affected would be
fully recompensed, and the government made clear that it expected effective
remedies to be introduced promptly.
The initial plan was for SIB to produce firm guidelines by the end of this
month. It is now expected to produce provisional guidelines next month, but
these could be revised 'at the edges' if there were difficulties with
implementation.
One of the problems causing the delay has been that the two studies
commissioned by SIB on the extent of poor advice given to customers - as
opposed to the extent of the failure to meet regulators' requirements - have
both fallen behind schedule.
Better information about the scale of compensation that may have to be paid
is needed before SIB can take a view on whether the provisional plans are
workable. A recent industry estimate put the total compensation bill at
between Pounds 400m and Pounds 800m.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Transport 'to top pollution league'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Transport will overtake power generation as the sector emitting the greatest
amount of carbon dioxide by the end of this decade. Yet demand for transport
fuel will slow if the government sticks to its target of raising road-fuel
duties by 5 per cent in real terms every year.
These are the main conclusions of a study of energy and the environment by
Cambridge Econometrics, the Cambridge-based consultancy.
The study found that while emissions from power generation will decline in
the years ahead, those from transport will continue to rise - particularly
from road transport which accounts for more than 90 per cent of all
transport emissions. But the rate of increase will slow.
The study challenges the traditional assumption that motorists readily
absorb higher petrol prices. It says new evidence suggests 'a much stronger
long-run response to price increases than previously estimated'. One reason
is that carmakers are now able to deliver greater efficiency benefits to
motorists who want to cut their petrol bills.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Union launches legal helpline
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The TGWU general union has become the first large union to launch a 24-hour
legal helpline to provide advice and assistance to members and their
families - an estimated 3m people.
The service is being operated for the union by the Leicestershire-based
CareAssist Group. 'From now on no member of a TGWU family will be more than
a telephone call away from the union - any time night or day, any day of the
year,' said Mr Bill Morris, general secretary.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Work categories 'misleading'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Government statisticians are creating a distorted view of the labour market
by categorising all those who are not full-time permanent employees as
belonging to the 'flexible workforce', says the independent employment
analysts Incomes Data Services.
The latest IDS report challenges the recent Department of Employment claim
that 38.2 per cent of all those in employment belong to the flexible
workforce.
The report argues that it is wrong to regard self-employed professionals
such as doctors, dentists, barristers, solicitors and accountants as part of
the flexible workforce rather than as equivalent to permanent full-time
employees.
It also says that large numbers of part-timers remain with the same employer
for many years. A separate IDS analysis shows that, in autumn of last year,
more than 40 per cent of women part-timers had been with their employers for
more than five years.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Portillo cool on full employment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Portillo yesterday signalled a change in the tone of the
government's approach to employment issues with a distinctly lukewarm
endorsement of the goal of full employment.
Speaking days after replacing Mr David Hunt as employment secretary, Mr
Portillo dismissed suggestions that he would refuse to continue the dialogue
with trade unions begun by his predecessor.
He said on BBC Television: 'I am not refusing to work with these people but
I will point out very strongly that their words and their actions point in
opposite directions.'
He was similarly unenthusiastic about Mr Hunt's recent public avowal of the
government's commitment to full employment. 'It is a great aspiration, but
unless you are careful it becomes merely a slogan. You have to take action
to help people get into jobs.'

FT  25 JUL 94 / Public's economic optimism 'rising'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
    By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Members of the public feel more optimistic about the state of the economy
and their employment prospects than at any time since May last year, says
the first of a series of surveys to be published monthly by the Financial
Times, Lisa Wood writes.
The index by MORI, the market research organisation, is based on two
surveys, one concerned with the fear of individuals in work becoming
redundant in the next 12 months, and the other on whether the public
generally expects the state of the economy to worsen.
The survey, entitled Mood of the Nation, was indexed at 100 in April 1993:
the higher the index, the more miserable the public. In its first month the
index was at 107. The misery level was highest last October (127) and at the
beginning of this year (124). In July the index was at 112, the lowest since
the index began.
There appear to be small but significant changes during the period in
individuals' financial behaviour, such as taking out loans or increasing
levels of credit card borrowing.
In 1993 26 per cent of the May sample said they intended to increase their
level of savings. That figure fell to 17 per cent this month. Fear of
redundancy itself had fallen slightly by this month, with 42 per cent of
respondents either 'very concerned' or 'fairly concerned' about losing their
jobs. In April, the last time the question was asked, the figure was 44 per
cent. Fear was highest last October, at 53 per cent. The survey was based on
interviews with 2,031 adults aged 18 plus at 150 constituencies across the
country with interviews conducted face to face between June 30 and July 4.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Longer rail strikes 'will hit industry'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR and ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Producers of bulk materials normally carried by rail have warned of losses
and potentially serious shortages and delays for industry when the rail
strike is stepped up this week.
Signal workers are switching their action from 24-hour strikes to a 48-hour
stoppage from noon tomorrow to noon on Thursday, hitting train movements
over three days.
Supplies of crushed rock used for road construction and repairs in
south-east England will be particularly badly affected. The region, which
has no locally produced hard rock, imports about 250,000 tonnes a week by
rail.
ARC, a subsidiary of Hanson and one of the country's biggest aggregate
producers, said it could lose Pounds 1m a week when the rail strike worsens.
It said it was uneconomic to transport crushed rock by road for more than 80
miles to 100 miles.
ARC and Foster Yeoman, a large independent aggregate producer, jointly own
Mendip Rail, which transports 7m tonnes a year of West Country limestone to
more than 20 rail depots in south-east England - accounting for almost 60
per cent of crushed rock brought in to the region.
It said that running additional trains on non-strike days would not help,
and added: 'Few depots are large enough to accommodate stockpiles.'
British Steel, the third-largest railfreight customer, said that if 48-hour
strikes continued it would have to consider switching more freight to the
roads.
The concern of big customers was shared by the railfreight companies.
Railfreight Distribution, which handles containerised freight and Channel
tunnel freight business, warned that the escalation of the strike would hit
customer confidence.
Trainload Freight Southeast, one of three regional companies which together
carry about 90m tonnes a year of bulk materials, expressed concern about the
long-term effects of the strike.
So far it had been able to shift freight movements to non-strike days and
would be seeking to run more freight trains on strike days.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Executive pay bias narrows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The salary gap between male and female executives is narrowing fast, says
the latest quarterly survey by pay and benefit consultants Sedgwick Noble
Lowndes.
The survey also finds that the downward trend in executive pay rises has
been reversed and that executive increases are now nearly 50 per cent higher
than the rise in average earnings, which is 3.75 per cent.
The news of the narrowing pay gap for women executives will be broadly
welcomed, especially after recent figures showing that the number of women
managers in Britain's top organisations is falling. Those figures, from the
Institute of Management, showed that the proportion of female senior
managers and directors had fallen from last year's 10.2 per cent to 9.5 per
cent.
The latest pay figures show that in the past 12 months the average increase
in women's base salary was 5.4 per cent compared with 5 per cent for men. In
the same period a year ago the average rise was 6 per cent for women
compared with 5.4 per cent. The statistics, drawn from a database of 5,199
executives in 407 companies, show a consistent pattern over the past four
years, with women receiving up to a fifth more - in relative terms - than
men in their pay awards.
But the gap remains wide. The average base salary for directors is Pounds
67,371 for men and Pounds 54,836 for women, a gap of 22.9 per cent.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Sinn Fein stresses positive side of response
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS and JOHN MCMANUS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sinn Fein officials were last night keen to stress the positive elements of
their official reaction to the Downing Street declaration - particularly
after widespread negative comment in Ireland and the UK.
The party's special conference yesterday failed to recommend that the IRA
end its campaign of violence. Had it done so it is likely that Sinn Fein
would have have been invited to join cross-party talks in the autumn.
Mr Martin McGuinness, a member of Sinn Fein's governing executive, hinted
after the conference that an IRA ceasefire could still be on the cards,
enabling the peace process to continue. He said: 'Sinn Fein is working with
others to bridge the gap. I want a situation where violence can be
diminished - the IRA has to make a contribution.' Asked whether current
conditions might be sufficient for the IRA to call a ceasefire, he said: 'I
am not prepared to say whether they do or do not exist - it is an area we
are working on.'
Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, spoke in his closing speech of a
'climate of change' and indicated that he believed the IRA could be
persuaded to end its violence 'if the proper conditions can be created'.
He said the challenge for Sinn Fein was to 'create the conditions in which
the IRA can act upon its clearly stated commitments and others will act upon
their responsibilities so that a negotiated settlement can be agreed'.
However it is clear that one of Sinn Fein's main priorities guiding its
response to the declaration has been to avoid a split in its own ranks. One
official said that the party, in arriving at its position, had travelled a
long way.
Mr Adams told the conference: 'I can assure you that we will endeavour with
your help and guidance to achieve the political objectives which we have set
ourselves. This struggle is united, confident and strong.'
He stressed that the British government should now view the ball as being
back in its court. He called on it 'to accept its responsibility to
pro-actively create the conditions which will make this possible'. He added
that de-militarisation was not 'a one-way street' and warned: 'Sinn Fein has
a duty to our electorate north and south and we are commited to upholding
their rights.'
In a detailed breakdown of the party's criticisms of the declaration, the
so-called unionist veto stands out as the biggest sticking-point. The
conference stated that 'the veto is a barrier to the consideration or
achievement of democratic options for all the Irish people. It has no legal,
constitutional or democratic basis'.
However another motion passed by the conference displayed Sinn Fein's
optimism. It said: 'We have identified these negative elements in the
Downing Street declaration in the hope that these difficulties can be
overcome. Sinn Fein is convinced that, despite the inadequacies of the
declaration, the potential to build upon a real peace process still exists.'

FT  25 JUL 94 / Commanders defend privileges on the home front: Bruce Clark
weighs the arguments over providing luxury abodes for senior officers in the
armed forces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'When a civil servant who regards himself as comparable to me in seniority
and age sees me living in a nice house, it makes him jealous.' That is the
explanation offered by one senior commander for the recent controversy over
high living by top servicemen.
Distinguished officers in Her Majesty's forces require little encouragement
to hold forth about such matters as peace-keeping doctrine or the future of
submarine warfare.
But there is another subject which can arouse equally strong passions, but
is not so willingly discussed in front of outsiders: their own housing and
privileges.
This month's disclosure of a Pounds 387,000 refurbishment for the home of an
air chief marshal has reminded the public of one of the things that
distinguish service life from the civilian world - the glamour of life at
the top.
Many of the homes are listed houses. Among the finest is Admiralty House, a
Georgian mansion overlooking Plymouth Sound. Others are simply expanded
versions of the red-brick 'married quarters' on glorified housing estates
where most officers and their families live.
The commander of British forces in Hong Kong enjoys a lifestyle in the
colony's most fashionable district which would be the envy of many a
civilian millionaire. Until recently UK forces in Germany occupied some
splendid mansions commandeered in 1945.
There is no precise correlation between high living and responsibility. A
decade ago the senior general in Northern Ireland was obliged by security
factors to move from a mansion outside Belfast to more modest quarters
inside a barracks. And the flat in central London that goes with the job of
Chief of the Defence Staff is comfortable rather than opulent.
Officers' residences are, of course, 'tied cottages', like a bishop's palace
or an Oxford master's lodge. They go with particular jobs, and the service
couples who inhabit them are only too aware that in a year or two they will
be washing their own dishes in plainer surroundings.
Senior officers will have to fight a skilful rearguard action to hold on to
their privileges when defence costs are being trimmed and numbers reduced.
There are 67 official residences for senior officers in the UK, 26 for the
navy, 23 for the army and 18 for the Royal Air Force. Another 10 residences
are located abroad. However, 14 residences have been sold in the past year
and more disposals are expected.
These establishments will hardly make or break the defence budget. Over the
past two years the upkeep of senior officers' homes has cost the taxpayer
about Pounds 5m, covering everything from new roofs to routine maintenance.
A total of 278 domestic staff - 25 of them overseas - are employed in these
houses, at an annual cost to the taxpayer of about Pounds 5m.
Some of the most exotic homes to which an officer can aspire - as head of
the garrison in Brunei or military adviser in Oman - cost the UK taxpayer
nothing because they are paid for by local sultans.
When set against total annual defence spending of Pounds 23bn, the sums
spent on officers' homes seem paltry enough.
But looked at from another angle, the figures can be embarrassing. The
average staff costs for each senior officer come to about Pounds 65,000 a
year, while the average value of each official residence is about Pounds
500,000.
From the officers' point of view the trouble is that any case they advance
in support of this state of affairs can sound hollow and self-serving.
But there are some practical arguments in favour of the current
arrangements. Senior service jobs include a public-relations function which
is comparable to that of ambassadors.
Their homes have to double as conference centres, restaurants and hotels for
a stream of dignitaries ranging from parliamentary delegations to Middle
Eastern potentates shopping for weapons.
Jobs with responsibility for conflict zones such as Northern Ireland or
Bosnia keep the holder on duty for 24 hours a day. He needs to be in
frequent touch with operational headquarters and to live close to his place
of work.
Given that these positions are rotated every year or two, it makes better
sense to keep permanent official residences than to provide officers with
housing allowances and expect them to waste time searching for
accommodation.
But these bread-and-butter arguments are not the ones most officers would
use in defence of their homes.
In the end, they would say, a hint of mystique and glamour is one of the
intangibles that draws talented people to service careers - and spurs them
on to compete for posts whose salaries are modest by civilian standards.
Like so many aspects of service life, from drill to military tattoos, this
cannot easily be explained to accountants.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Car dealers fight battle of the bulge: John Griffiths on
moves to do away with letter prefixes on licence plates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 'M' licence plate for new cars registered from August 1 may mark the
beginning of the end of the annual prefix letter system.
The annual registration letter change, for years proclaimed by the motor
industry as a useful boost to sales, is now regarded by much of the industry
as having grown into a market-distorting monster.
As a result, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders is investigating
a number of alternative systems which it hopes to present to the government
before the end of this year.
That would be too late to prevent the 'N' plate going ahead on August 1 next
year. But if the society has its way, the 'P' plate due in 1996 will never
appear.
It might seem strange that much of the motor industry, still recovering from
its worst recession since the second world war, now wants to abandon a
system which the society itself expects will lead to about 500,000 new cars
being registered next month.
But even the big UK manufacturers consider that the benefits of the larger
market presumed to be created by the system are outweighed by the disruption
it causes to both trade and industry for several months either side of
August.
Uneven cashflow, increased marketing and stocking costs and coping with the
flood of unwanted trade-ins left on dealers' forecourts in September are
just some of the problems which the August 'bulge' has created.
This year new-car registrations in August could exceed one-quarter of the
entire year's total for the first time, said Professor Garel Rhys, SMMT
professor of motor industry economics at Cardiff Business School. In
contrast, July has become a virtual sales desert for dealers, accounting for
about 2 per cent of registrations.
Many dealers say that the effect of motorists deciding to 'wait for the
plate' are felt as early as May.
Left unchecked, said Prof Rhys, the bulge could continue to expand until it
reached 42 per cent to 43 per cent of the market. But carmakers, having
adopted 'lean' manufacturing systems, are also introducing lean distribution
 -requiring as little as two weeks between placing of order and delivery.
Sewells International, the marketing monitoring group, said that replacing
the existing system with one spreading sales more evenly through the year
could save the industry almost Pounds 1.5bn in stocking and related costs.
The industry is not approaching the government in a wholly united manner,
however. The Retail Motor Industry Federation, the main trade association
for dealers, maintains that the extra sales it still believes are generated
by the prefix system are worth having, although the month of the new
letter's introduction might beneficially be moved, perhaps to October.
Yet this is a stance from which some of the UK's biggest dealers distance
themselves. Cowie Group, which has an Pounds 800m turnover and sells one in
every 40 new cars in the UK, described the August prefix as a 'massive
financial and logistical headache for the industry'. It results in UK
motorists paying more than necessary for new cars, said Mr Iain Jane,
managing director of Cowie's motor division.
He added: 'In the run-up to August, dealers sustain substantial overheads
out of all proportion to the rest of the year. They have to stock and
safeguard around three times their normal numbers of new cars, absorb the
associated costs, deal with staffing problems during the UK's peak holiday
period and at the same time they have to ensure that every customer gets
sufficient care and attention.'
Industry analysts believe that even if August registrations do match the
1989 record, they will be achieved, at best, at only marginal profit.
The 1989 record was set during a booming economy with consumer confidence at
an all-time high. In contrast a boom in registrations next month would be
against a background of continuing economic uncertainty, a faltering housing
market and other signs of consumer misgivings. Prof Rhys said it could only
mean a heavily forced market, with marketing incentives offered at a huge
cost to the industry and many cars pre-registered by dealers for which there
may be no actual buyers.
Alternatives so far suggested include number plates based on regions; a
prefix introduced at short notice at variable times during the year; and
random use of the remaining prefix letters.
An attempt to revise the system in the late 1980s failed largely because the
industry could not reach consensus on an alternative.
However, the police also opposed abandoning the annual prefix because, the
Home Office said, it helped people remember number plates and thus catch
wrongdoers.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Blair launches strong defence of the family
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair yesterday eschewed the leftwing liberalism of Labour's past in
favour of a strong defence of the family as a central component of social
cohesion.
In a further step towards repositioning his party in the political middle
ground, the Labour leader said that 'common sense' rather than ideology
would be the driving force behind its approach to social policy.
But he found himself under strong attack from the Conservatives over
education policy, with ministers saying that Labour would ignore the wishes
of parents by returning grant-maintained schools to the control of local
authorities.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, intends to use a speech later this week
to argue that Mr Blair's election has not closed the gap between the
Conservatives and Labour on the key issues of individual choice and
responsibility.
Mr Blair, in comments likely to irritate the left wing of his party,
emphasised the need for government to recognise the family as 'the
essential, stable social unit'.
He attacked the Conservatives for 'stigmatising' single parents, most of
whom had not chosen to bring up their children alone.
But in an unapologetic defence of what he termed 'commonsense' values, Mr
Blair said adults should not choose to have children outside stable
relationships. The small group of women who did so were 'wrong'.
In his first full-length television interview since his election as leader
last week he told Mr Brian Walden on London Weekend Television: 'The family
is important because it is the social unit where people learn the boundaries
of decent conduct and behaviour and where people are brought up.'
Mr Blair added that social, education and training policies under a Labour
government would be geared to supporting and sustaining the family unit. But
parents would be obliged to recognise they had responsibilities as well as
rights.
His remarks came as Labour's plans to overturn many of the Conservatives'
education reforms were attacked by ministers.
Mr Blair will launch proposals tomorrow to end the centralised funding of
grant-maintained schools, abolish A-levels in favour of a broader
qualification for 18-year-olds and modify the present system of schools
testing.
He intends to underline a new emphasis on driving up educational standards,
extending nursery education and promoting discipline and pupil assessment.
Ministers seized on the issue of grant-maintained schools to say that Labour
was committed to reducing choice.
Mr Blair has said the schools must be put back under local control but has
refused to say if this would mean their reversion to councils.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Pay gap between sexes narrows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The salary gap between male and female executives is narrowing fast, says
the latest quarterly survey by pay and benefit consultants Sedgwick Noble
Lowndes.
The survey also finds that the downward trend in executive pay rises has
been reversed and that executive increases are now nearly 50 per cent higher
than the rise in average earnings, which is 3.75 per cent.
The news of the narrowing pay gap for women executives will be broadly
welcomed, especially after recent figures showing that the number of women
managers in Britain's top organisations is falling. Those figures, from the
Institute of Management, showed that the proportion of female senior
managers and directors had fallen from last year's 10.2 per cent to 9.5 per
cent.
The latest pay figures show that in the past 12 months the average increase
in women's base salary was 5.4 per cent compared with 5 per cent for their
male counterparts. In the same period a year ago the average rise was 6 per
cent for women compared with 5.4 per cent. The statistics, drawn from a
database of 5,199 executives in 407 companies, show a consistent pattern
over the past four years, with women receiving up to a fifth more - in
relative terms - than men in their pay awards.
But the gap remains wide. The average base salary for directors is Pounds
67,371 for men and Pounds 54,836 for women, a gap of 22.9 per cent. For
function heads the gap drops to 10.2 per cent - Pounds 44,832 for men and
Pounds 40,698 for women. At departmental level the difference is 9 per cent
 -Pounds 36,259 for men and Pounds 33,169 for women.
Mr Andy Christie, remuneration consulting director at Sedgwick Noble
Lowndes, said: 'There has been an attempt to narrow the pay gap, at least at
executive level, but it is still considerable and appears to widen as women
climb the executive ladder. At director level men are still earning over 20
per cent more than women in similar positions.'
Overall, 27 per cent of executives have enjoyed pay awards of between 5 per
cent and 10 per cent since January, compared with 18 per cent in the
previous six months. There has also been a sharp increase in the number of
executives receiving performance-related bonuses: in the past year 44 per
cent received them compared with 39 per cent in the previous year.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Railtrack confident of imminent end to RMT strike action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Railtrack remains optimistic that a deal with the RMT transport union can be
agreed in the next fortnight in spite of the start tomorrow of the first
48-hour strike in the dispute over signal workers' pay, David Goodhart
writes.
A senior Railtrack representative said at the weekend that it was
'unthinkable' that the weekly strikes would still be occurring on August 12,
the earliest date by which the 500 RMT signal supervisors could join the
strike.
The supervisors are being balloted on joining the strike and the result is
expected by August 4. If they do so it will become much more difficult for
Railtrack to maintain the 25 per cent to 30 per cent service it hopes to run
over the next two days.
Railtrack said: 'We believe that a combination of parliament being on
holiday and the greater pain felt by RMT signal staff at losing two days'
pay will make it easier to get a deal.'
Railtrack's optimism was not shared last night by the RMT, however. The
union accused Railtrack of preparing to call in supervisors with no
experience in signal boxes. Railtrack denies that unsuitable staff are being
used.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Drug sales growth slows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmacy drugs sales recorded either slower growth or declines in every
significant European market during the first five months this year compared
with the same period in 1993.
The only exception was Germany, the region's largest market, where sales
staged a small recovery after last year's steep falls. However, sales were
still down on 1992 levels.
The deceleration has been caused by healthcare reforms throughout Europe,
described last week by Mr John Robb, chief executive and chairman of
Wellcome, the UK drugs group, as a series of hammer-blows.
Sales in Europe's top seven markets fell from Dollars 19.1bn (Pounds 12.3bn)
to Dollars 18.2bn, although in local currencies they rose by 2 per cent,
according to IMS International, the specialist market research company. The
US market expanded by 7 per cent to Dollars 19.67bn, while the Japanese
market was static in yen terms but rose in dollars from Dollars 7.7bn to
Dollars 8.45bn.
The Italian market has been the worst hit in Europe. Year-on-year sales fell
7 per cent from Dollars 3.59bn to Dollars 3.08bn. That compares with Dollars
4.7bn for the same period in 1992. The market is set for further falls this
year once the Italian government has decided on additional price cuts,
possibly as large as 10 per cent.
The French market, which was growing at 6.5 per cent during the first five
months last year, was static in local currency terms but fell in dollars
from Dollars 5.18bn to Dollars 4.9bn.
In the UK, where sales were up 11.6 per cent during the first five months
last year, market growth decelerated to 8 per cent in sterling as price cuts
and government controls on prescribing began to bite. In dollar terms, sales
increased from Dollars 2.017bn to Dollars 2.154bn.
In Spain, last year Europe's fastest expanding market at 13.6 per cent,
growth fell to 3 per cent. In dollars, the market declined from Dollars
1.817bn to Dollars 1.577bn.
Market growth in Belgium fell from 5.8 per cent to 3 per cent, while in the
Netherlands sales growth dropped from 13.4 per cent to 4 per cent.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Stronger rules urged to prevent trade war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Business Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A fresh outbreak of trade warfare is likely unless stronger multilateral
trade rules are drawn up quickly in the wake of last year's Uruguay Round
agreement, a study* commissioned by a transatlantic group of business and
labour leaders and academics warns today.
The study, published by the British-North American Committee, implicitly
criticises the thinking behind current US trade and industrial policies as
one of the main challenges to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The conclusions are firmly endorsed by the committee's joint chairmen, Sir
David Plastow, chairman of Inchcape, the British services group, and Mr John
Heimann, a former US comptroller of the currency and senior executive of
Merrill Lynch, the US investment bank.
The committee believes the principles of the multilateral trade system are
threatened by a growing belief among policy-makers that economic advantage
is best achieved by promoting national champion industries and other
monopolistic and oligopolistic forms of competition.
The study points out that enthusiasm for this so-called New International
Trade Theory (NITT) is particularly strong among senior members of the
Clinton administration, which have used it to justify more government
support for US exports and subsidies for high-tech industries.
Though the theory offered some valuable insights into international trade,
policies based on it might not deliver the expected benefits.
Such policies were also likely to distort markets and provoke retaliation
unless further multilateral agreements were reached soon to liberalise
non-tariff barriers, curb subsidies, reform anti-dumping regulations and
restrict cartels.
'If Gatt cannot be reformed fast enough to embody new international rules
covering non-tariff trade trade barrier issues, there will be intense
pressure on public and private sector decision-makers to deploy NITT
trade-enhancing strategies to an increasing extent.'
The authors, a US and a British economist, say one solution could be to
create a 'Super-Gatt', membership of which would be open to countries which
signed up to new rules intended to eliminate non-tariff barriers.
Members of the British-North American Committee committee are drawn from the
UK, the US and Canada, and include senior executives of many large
companies. *Unfinished Tasks: The New International Trade Theory and

FT  25 JUL 94 / Struggle for market share puts industry in turmoil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US healthcare industry has not been waiting on President Clinton. Every
part of the healthcare chain, from financing through to dispensing drugs, is
in upheaval, as companies strive to cut costs or fight for market share.
One result has been a string of mergers and acquisitions: four deals worth a
total of Dollars 13.5bn (Pounds 8.7bn) have been announced in the past three
months alone, making this the most active part of the US corporate takeover
market.
The causes for the shake-up can be traced directly to boardrooms, not to
Washington.
Take Ford Motor. In 1970 spending on healthcare for its workers amounted to
6 per cent of the US carmaker's payroll costs. Escalating health care
inflation (costs rose at more than double the rate of general inflation
during the 1980s) and an ageing workforce have pushed that figure up to 19
per cent. US companies, on behalf of their current and retired workers and
dependents, foot most of the the US's health bill. The cost could be making
them uncompetitive.
'Mercedes can start up (in the US) from scratch, hire a younger workforce
and not have the costs. They have an immediate advantage,' says Mr Robert
Ozment, director of corporate and employee insurance at Ford. 'The first
issue is to get national costs under control. Then we can talk about how you
finance the system.'
The drive by companies such as Ford to hold down their costs in this area,
under way for some time, has led directly to the indsutry's latest string of
mergers and acquisitions.
Companies have used managed care to take control of their healthcare costs.
Rather than simply paying their employees'ever-rising health insurance
premiums without question, they have pursued ways to bring down costs.
In its purest form, managed care involves enrolling an employee in a Health
Maintenance Organisation. For a fee, the HMO provides all the employee's
healthcare, from prescription drugs to a doctor's appointment. The HMO in
turn keeps costs in check by using only certain hospitals or doctors, or by
giving preference to certain companies' drugs: this enables them to
negotiate volume discounts.
HMOs have grown fast, and are expected to provide cover for one in five
Americans by the end of this year. Adding in other, looser variants on the
theme, such as point-of-service plans and preferred-provider organisations,
about half all US workers are now estimated to be covered by some form of
managed care arrangement.
The growing buying power of these organisations is the single biggest factor
shaping the healthcare industry, which accounts for about 14 per cent of the
US economy. Their impact is already being felt: annual healthcare inflation
fell from about 9 per cent in 1990 to less than 6 per cent last year. Drug
price inflation dropped from an annual 10 per cent to 3 per cent over the
same period.
The impact of this reining-in of price increases has been felt in all parts
of the healthcare industry:
Drug companies, though their products account for only 7 per cent of total
US healthcare spending, have seen some of the greatest upheaval.
Unless a drug carries benefits that are clearly superior to rivals in the
market, it is likely to be subjected to severe price discounting.
'A lot of research and development spending has gone into copying other
people's drugs and then changing a molecule or two. That really isn't
helpful,' says Dr Jay Crosson, an associate director at Kaiser Permanente,
the US's largest managed care group.
The result has been escalating price competition, and efforts by the biggest
companies to increase their market share and cut costs.
The takeovers have taken two forms. One has been the acquisition by drugs
companies of pharmacy benefit managers, large-scale pharmacies which make up
prescriptions, usually by mail. By controlling these distributors, which
have brought down costs in part by encouraging doctors to prescribe cheaper
drugs, the manufacturers hope to be able to sell more of their own products
at the expense of their rivals. Merck, Eli Lilly and SmithKline Beecham have
between them paid a total of Dollars 13bn to buy the country's three biggest
pharmacy benefit managers in the past year, two of the them in recent weeks.
The second form of takeover has been the acquisition of one drugs company by
another, signalling consolidation in an industry which is having to adjust
from the high-growth expectations of the 1980s to the prospect of a
lower-growth future. Sterling Winthrop, previously owned by Eastman Kodak,
and Syntex, a struggling US company, have both been bought by bigger
European pharmaceuticals groups.
Hospitals - which account for about half all US spending on healthcare  -
have faced their own cost pressures. Besides the discounts demanded by
managed care organisation, most hospitals also face problems of
overcapacity. Better control of the way patients are handled, improvements
in surgical techniques and the growing availability of care in the home have
all contributed to a shortening of the length of time the average patient
spends in a hospital bed.
With too many beds to go around, some hospitals have been closing wards. The
country's biggest private hospital group, known as Columbia/HCA since a
recent acquisition, has reacted differently: by buying up other hospitals
companies, then closing entire sites in areas where there are too many
hospital beds, Columbia/HCA has improved the profitability of its remaining
sites.
Health maintenance organisations and insurance companies have also been
sucked into the restructuring of the healthcare industry. United Healthcare,
one of the biggest of the HMO groups, has itself embarked on an acquisition
spree, buying up local HMO companies around the country. It recently agreed
to sell Diversified Pharmaceutical Services, a pharmacy benefit manager it
owned, for Dollars 2.3bn, providing it with more cash to continue its
acquisitions.
Meanwhile, insurance companies, responding to the change in the market, have
been busy converting their traditional health insurance businesses into
managed care organisations. One result: an agreement last month between two
of the country's biggest insurers, Travelers and Metropolitan Life, to
combine their health insurance activities in a new joint venture company.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Mandela faces dilemma over labour unrest

<TEXT>
South Africa's new all-race government of national unity is struggling to
cope with a week-long wave of labour unrest, and there are fears that new
strikes may break out, damaging international investor confidence.
The current spate of industrial action has been sparked by a 10-day-long
strike by 15,000 workers at food retailer Pick 'n Pay. Over the past few
days a number of smaller wildcat strikes in the private and public sector
have also broken out.
The newly aggressive attitude among workers is being fuelled by raised
expectations resulting from the economy's return to growth after a four-year
recession, and the belief that the new government will be much more
sympathetic to wage demands than its white-led predecessor.
The African National Congress, which won the April elections, has strong
links with the trade union movement. However, the government is torn between
its natural sympathy for the strikers and its need to reassure businessmen
and foreign investors about its commitment to a stable business environment
and low inflation.
However, violent clashes between strikers and police officers have led to
accusations by workers of government bad faith in its labour relations
policy. Despite a series of meetings with ministers, no solution to the
strike has emerged although strikers and managment agreed to mediation terms
yesterday.
The Congress of South African Trade Unions, the country's largest trade
union federation, which remains in formal political alliance with the ANC,
has publicly called on the government to stop paying excessive attention to
business interests and concentrate on its own constituency.
After returning from a three-day state visit to Mozambique, President Nelson
Mandela warned publicly that the strikes could scare off desperately needed
foreign investment. However, Mr Sam Shilowa, Cosatu president, denied this
would happen, charging that the principle of legitimate industrial action
was globally accepted.
This year has already seen the most industrial action since 1991, and with
workers demanding substantial real wage increases in the current round of
negotiations more major strikes are possible in coming weeks.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Vice-President Al Gore and the Democratic leaders of both houses of the US
Congress yesterday reasserted their determination to pass a healthcare
reform bill this year that would eventually provide medical insurance
coverage for all Americans.
Mr George Mitchell, the Senate majority leader, said he would introduce a
bill within the next week and that he intended to keep the Senate in session
'until we complete action on it', even if that meant delaying the summer
recess due to start in three weeks.
The vice-president, Mr Mitchell and Congressman Richard Gephardt, the House
majority leader, all conceded, as Mr Gore put it in a television interview,
that 'the phase-in period may have to be extended' from the administration's
target date of 1998.
Mr Gore said that to wait eight to 10 years for universal coverage to take
effect was 'way too long'. But he insisted that the administration had
always accepted that in tackling 'the biggest social policy challenge this
country has faced in 60 years' there would be 'give and take and a lot of
changes' as Congress moved towards a final resolution.
'The one thing that can't change is universal coverage,' he said, 'and that
has to pass this year.' Mr Gephardt added: 'The important thing is to plant
the flag and make the decision' on the principle of coverage for all.
Mr Gephardt and Mr Mitchell refused to speculate on the details of their
respective bills, beyond noting that they would inevitably reflect
compromises between the various bills already approved by four congressional
committees.
But Mr Gephardt agreed with Mr Gore it was 'reasonable' to expect delays in
introducing so-called employer mandates, under which companies would pay for
a substantial part of the insurance premiums of their workforces. He
suggested a four- to five-year lag before full implementation, while Mr
Mitchell said emphasis on introduction by a given year would be 'misplaced'.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Key terms and issues in debate
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIVERSAL COVERAGE: The bottom line of the original Clinton plan was health
cover for all Americans, the only exceptions being specific social or
religious groups with objections to inclusion. Of the four congressional
committees that approved versions of healthcare legislation, only the
influential Senate finance committee rejected this demand. It opted instead
for a target of 95 per cent population cover by 2002. A commission would
recommend mandatory measures if this target were not met. However, the
Senate in particular may take its lead from the committee's failure to back
universal coverage and President Clinton has now signalled flexibility.
EMPLOYER MANDATE: Another cornerstone of the Clinton plan, this requires
employers to pay the bulk of their workers' health insurance costs - 80 per
cent in the administration's proposals. However, the Senate finance
committee also rejected this concept, again prompting Mr Clinton to hint at
compromise. Joint employer/employee mandates have been floated as a way of
resolving this toughest question in healthcare reform - who pays?
COST CONTROLS: All the versions of healthcare reform legislation approved by
congressional committees envisage some form of cost containment measures,
such as taxes on expensive premiums, fee schedules and cost targets or
outright caps on how much premiums can be raised each year.
TAXATION: Apart from employer and employee mandates, extra taxes have been
proposed to pay for health reform. These include extra taxes on cigarettes,
guns and ammunition, and assessments on some big employers.
HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANISATIONS: Organisations which offer consumers a
range of health benefits for an annual fee, largely using medical
practitioners under contract. Consolidation in the healthcare industry and
consumers' desire to cut costs are strengthening the HMOs independently of
the progress of healthcare reform legislation.
FEE-FOR-SERVICE: The traditional American way of doing medicine, where
doctors are paid by patients or their insurers for each consultation or
treatment. Specialist (and therefore expensive) doctors are already coming
under pressure from the HMOs and the more standardised cover they offer.
INSURANCE MARKET REFORM: Under all the bills voted out of congressional
committees, insurers will be required to sell a standard benefits package.
Measures are also planned to prevent insurers discriminating against the old
and the sick.
MEDICARE AND MEDICAID: Existing government health programmes for the elderly
and the poor respectively. Current versions of reform legislation envisage
the abolition of Medicaid as beneficiaries take up insurance elsewhere, with
the government picking up the tab. The House Ways and Means committee
approved a massive extension of Medicare to those who could not buy
insurance elsewhere. ABORTION: A divisive issue both in and out of Congress
that could sink reform altogether. The administration wants abortion cover
included in the standard package of healthcare benefits, but the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops, which supports health reform, has vowed to
fight on this issue.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Congress leaders face tactics challenge: A single reform
bill must somehow emerge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For much of the summer, President Bill Clinton's ambitious attempt to
overhaul the entire US healthcare system had disappeared into a maelstrom of
detailed legislative drafting and behind-the-scenes political dealing.
Even the intervention last Thursday by the Democratic leadership, with the
approval of the president, to draft a new compromise bill does not, per se,
transform the maelstrom into a quiet, pellucid pond.
For the task of the Democratic leaders of both chambers - Senator George
Mitchell on the Senate side and Congressman Richard Gephardt for the House
of Representatives - remains much as it was. This is to work to pull
together a single bill from the heterogeneous versions presented to them by
separate committees.
But the different rules and traditions of each chamber present each leader
with a very different tactical challenge .
The Senate's free-flowing rules of debate mean that virtually any amendment
can be brought up at any time. Mr Mitchell will therefore try to produce a
single working bill (with luck, by the end of this week) which could then be
debated for weeks on the Senate floor.
His challenge is to bring together senior Democrats such as Senator Edward
Kennedy, whose labour committee passed a bill closely resembling Mr
Clinton's proposal, with the finance committee centrists who produced a very
different reform plan relying largely on improvements to the insurance
market, and falling a long way short of the president's goal of universal
coverage.
In the House the hand-to-hand fighting will take place not on the floor but
in the rules committee, which is dominated by the Democratic leadership and
the chairmen of the main committees. This committee can decide which
amendments and which rival plans come up for debate. The leadership is
expected to adopt a 'king of the hill' strategy, under which the last
version to win a majority would stand, eliminating previous versions.
The timing of a House bill, however, is problematic. Many members are wary
of being 'BTU-ed' again; they fear a repetition of the battle over the
budget in 1993 when they were cajoled or coerced into casting a difficult
vote for Mr Clinton's proposed tax on the number of British Thermal Units
(the common measure of heating energy) in fuels, only to see the BTU tax
dropped in the face of Senate opposition.
The House may, therefore, seek to open debate after, or at least at the same
time as, the Senate.
In both chambers, however, the employer mandate - a cornerstone of Mr
Clinton's plan under which employers would be required to provide health
insurance to all their workers and pay for 80 per cent of its cost - is seen
as having at best an outside chance of survival.
Senator Kennedy has mooted a plan that seeks to gain centrist support by
requiring employers to pay only 50 per cent, and not obliging them to cover
their workers' dependents.
Mr Mitchell has endorsed this approach in principle. Even the backing of
these two titans, however, still falls a long way short of commanding a
majority.
The administration ran the risk of being left on the sidelines in this
process, until the White House's strategy session with the Democratic
leadership last Thursday night left something of the impression of a common
purpose.
Mr Clinton claimed on Friday that there was agreement on the broad
principles - guaranteed universal coverage, if not necessarily by 1998 as he
had proposed, quality and choice for the patient, emphasis on preventative
and primary care, and cost containment.
But until then, both he, his wife and a phalanx of administration officials
had been trying to fight fire (the unbelievable blitz of special interest
commercials attacking the government plan) with fire of their own. Typical
was a speech by Mr Clinton two weeks ago in Pennsylvania on who has
comprehensive medical insurance coverage.
'The politicians have it. The wealthy have it. The poor have it. If you go
to jail you've got it. Only the middle class can lose it. I don't think that
makes much sense in America.'
The understanding with the Democratic leadership did not prevent Mrs Hillary
Clinton and other officials from fanning out around the country to start a
series of bus caravans which will converge on Washington from all corners to
campaign for whatever bill the Democratic leadership may produce.
But the administration role for the time being is mostly limited to
providing computer regressions and cost estimates for the variations being
discussed by congressional staffs as they try to piece together a bill.
That jigsaw work is still difficult to complete, for a number of pieces are
missing.
One of the principal ones is the official cost estimate from the
Congressional Budget Office on the plan produced by the Senate finance
committee. The CBO is expected to show that the scheme falls Dollars 80bn to
Dollars 100bn (Pounds 51.6bn to Pounds 64.5bn) short of financing itself
over the next five years.
This is potentially a damaging blow to a plan that has until now been hailed
as the most centrist version of reform.
Although some White House officials would still dearly love to produce a
bipartisan bill, most have given up all hope of winning over more than one
or two Republicans in the Senate. Senator James Jeffords of Vermont seems
the most susceptible, though Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon, his reputation
already grievously damaged by charges of sexual harassment, may seek to
redeem himself by working to pass a cause with which he has long been
associated.
That leaves the administration searching for the kind of wafer-thin majority
that passed its budget in 1993, and extremely vulnerable to the defection of
Democrats who feel strongly about ancillary issues.
Potential coalition-breakers include the tobacco tax, which will finance
much of the reform's additional costs, and the question of whether abortion
should be included in a nationally mandated benefits package.
But unlike the budget, where individual elements could be traded away, the
healthcare reform has to work as a complete system - or it could end up
making everything worse.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Middle East peace process 'irreversible': Julian Ozanne
looks at today's historic meeting in Washington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, and King Hussein of Jordan are
expected to declare before the world the end of a 46-year state of war and
the irreversible nature of their peace process, at a meeting in Washington
today.
The meeting will signify the full return of Jordan to the western fold after
the king's support for Iraq during the Gulf crisis. Israelis believe the
peace process will also consolidate a realignment of forces in a Middle East
dominated no longer by the Arab-Israeli conflict but by the greater threat
of Iran and its export of Islamic fundamentalism.
The geo-political dimension is a significant factor, although probably more
so to Israel and the US. Much more important to Jordan are the economic
incentives which are driving peace efforts.
King Hussein has always been a moderate and pragmatist but he has waited
before signing a peace treaty with Israel in the interests of wider Arab
solidarity.
A formal peace treaty will still take several months to complete and will
give Syria and Lebanon a little more time to strike their own deals.
The king has decided to go ahead with normalising relations and implementing
joint projects ahead of a formal treaty, which is only a matter of time.
Some economic measures will be announced today as the first steps towards
integrating the economies of Jordan, Israel, Egypt and the Palestinians into
a Middle East common market.
Jordan and Israel share geographic and economic resources: the Jordan
Valley, the Dead Sea, the Arava desert, the water sources of the Jordan and
Yarmouk rivers and the Red Sea Gulf of Aqaba.
Last week's economic talks held on the Jordanian side of the Dead Sea
revealed the extent of economic co-operation which could develop well ahead
of the peace treaty.
At present it is even impossible to telephone Amman from Jerusalem or Tel
Aviv, as Jordan has blocked the lines. Opening phone lines and borders would
be an easy first step. Opening the borders would also fuel tourism.
The two sides also discussed other possible first steps such as establishing
commercial flights, reopening Jordanian banks which operated in the West
Bank before 1967, and establishing trade relations.
More difficult and expensive will be projects like a plan discussed last
week for a joint development strategy of the Jordan Valley and Arava desert
from Yarmouk in the north to Aqaba in the south. The scheme would encourage
tourism and preserve the environment, and includes a Dollars 3bn (Pounds
1.9bn) project to bring Red Sea water to the Dead Sea by constructing a
canal which would generate hydro-electricity and preserve the water levels
in the Dead Sea.
Apart from the joint projects, US President Bill Clinton has also promised
to ask Congress to relieve Dollars 950m of Jordanian debt and to supply
military equipment to modernise the king's outdated army.
Israel stands to benefit almost as much as Jordan. But Israel is driven much
more by the psychological dimension of peace, and today's Rabin-Hussein
handshake will signify the acceptance and increased security Israelis crave
in the Middle East.
Jordan has agreed to allow Israeli airliners to use its airspace for flights
to the Far East and India, the Israeli transport ministry said yesterday,
Reuter reports from Jerusalem. It said the US would ask Saudi Arabia to
grant similar airspace rights to El Al, Israel's national carrier.

FT  25 JUL 94 / First meeting for Asia-Pacific forum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
North Korea's nuclear programme, the Cambodian civil war and territorial
disputes over the islands and oilfields of the South China Sea will be among
the topics of debate today at the launch of an 18-member multilateral
security forum for Asia and the Pacific.
But the foreign ministers attending the first, three-hour meeting of the
Asean Regional Forum (ARF) in Bangkok say they are unlikely to make
substantial decisions on such issues until they have reach agreement on the
role of ARF itself.
The organisation, the first of its kind in Asia, is being founded to discuss
Asian security following the end of the cold war. Russia's power in the
region has diminished with the collapse of international communism, and the
US has withdrawn some of its military forces from the Pacific, while Chinese
economic and military influence is on the rise.
All three superpowers are members. ARF comprises the six countries in the
Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) - Brunei, Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand - as well as the US, the
European Union, Japan, China, Russia, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South
Korea, Vietnam, Laos and Papua New Guinea.
The various foreign ministers already meet annually for political and
economic talks, and regional security has now been added to their list of
concerns.
Mr Chuan Leekpai, the Thai prime minister, opened this year's Asean meeting
by calling for urgent efforts to avert any armed confrontation that might
arise from territorial disputes in Asia. 'The competition for ocean space
and resources in the South China Sea is a particularly worrisome prospect,'
he said. 'A regional arms race is another concern. The creation of some kind
of regional arms control regime can deter arms build-ups.'
Some ARF members, led by Australia and encouraged by the US, want to ensure
that the organisation develops quickly and begins to take concrete measures
to improve security. They also want officials of the member countries to
meet more than once a year. China, on the other hand, favours a slower start
for ARF, apparently because it does not want to become enmeshed in
multilateral negotiations over territorial disputes when it has so much
clout in bilateral meetings.
Several ideas for enhancing regional security have already been aired ahead
of today's inaugural meeting. The first is an exchange of defence white
papers, so that each government can understand how the others perceive their
strategic interests and the threats that face them.
Another proposal is to establish a regional arms register, especially since
some ARF members have yet to disclose details of their weapons to the United
Nations register.
The need to settle territorial disputes is likely to remain near the top of
the agenda, especially in and around the Spratly islands in the South China
Sea, where six Asian countries have overlapping claims and China and Vietnam
have both awarded oil exploration concessions in disputed zones. One
suggested solution is a 'joint development zone' for oil and gas modelled on
the offshore zone now being exploited by Thailand and Malaysia.

FT  25 JUL 94 / 'Our nation is in pieces': Leslie Crawford talks to the new
president about recreating Rwanda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not often that a president is charged with the task of reinventing, as
well as rebuilding, a nation. Such is the challenge facing Mr Pasteur
Bizimungu, Rwanda's new president.
Mr Bizimungu is taking over a country with half its people in exile, and a
history of ethnic conflict which reached its chilling apotheosis in the
genocide of the minority Tutsi ethnic group by the majority Hutus in April.
He believes the only way Hutu and Tutsi may live together again is by
erasing the ethnic distinctions which divided them in the past.
'Our nation is in pieces,' Mr Bizimungu said at the weekend. 'We must teach
new values to the population, based on respect for universal rights.'
Mr Bizimungu must try to govern with no civil service, electricity, running
water or telecommunications. The only institution functioning at present is
the army of the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front, which installed Mr Bizimungu
as president last Tuesday.
Yet he insists he will not be a mere civilian figurehead for a military
regime. 'I joined the RPF when it launched its struggle in 1990,' he says.
'I was their spokesman in Brussels and I led the peace negotiations with the
former government.'
The Tutsi-led RPF has been careful to name Hutus such as Mr Bizimungu to
prominent positions in the new government, and to include moderate political
parties in the cabinet. It even invited two members of the former ruling
party to join, but they declined.
Real power, however, is expected to remain in the hands of Gen Paul Kagame,
the military commander who formed an army of Tutsi exiles in 1990 to fight
the Hutu dictatorship of Gen Juvenal Habyarimana. Gen Kagame has taken the
posts of defence minister and vice-president.
Mr Bizimungu will not say how long the RPF-installed government intends to
remain in power. The government has hundreds of thousands of displaced
people to resettle. They must be housed where they feel safe. The survivors
of Tutsi massacres may be reluctant to return to their former villages.
Hutus who have fled into exile must be persuaded to return. The government
must ensure security throughout the country. It may be a generation before
Hutu and Tutsi can live together again.'
Mr Bizimungu says his first priority is to persuade millions of Hutus who
have fled Rwanda to return. That task may be made more difficult by the new
government's intention to bring the authors of the Tutsi genocide to
justice. 'Impunity will not be a condition for reconciliation,' he says.
'Those who have killed must face justice.'
But with few magistrates and a non-existent judiciary, the new president
admits that the task of bringing suspects to trial is beyond Rwanda's
capabilities at present.
Mr Bizimungu, a 44-year-old former banker, has moved into the former
dictator's residence. As if he needed a reminder of Rwanda's recent bloody
past, the wreck of the presidential aircraft, which was shot down on April 6
by unknown saboteurs, can still be found in the grounds of the presidential
mansion. The assassination was used by Hutu extremists as a pretext to
launch their plan to exterminate the Tutsi population and the moderate Hutu
leadership.
Mr Bizimungu concedes the extremists, now in Zaire, still pose a threat to
the new government. In the absence of an extradition treaty with Zaire, the
remnants of the Hutu army could yet regroup and restart the war. The new
government in Rwanda is seeking the co-operation of foreign governments to
bring the leaders of the former government and army to justice, and Mr
Bizimungu hopes to meet President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire this week to
discuss the issue.

Foreign ministers of Asean said at the weekend they were ready to accept
Vietnam as a member, but did not set a date, writes Victor Mallet in
Bangkok.
Asean was established in 1967 by countries seeking to protect themselves
from the spread of communism. Vietnam still has a communist government, but
the cold war has ended and Asean wants eventually to embrace all the
countries of the region to form a common front on economic and security
issues.
Vietnam's entry may be delayed by concerns over its willingness to implement
mutual tariff cuts under the proposed Asean Free Trade Area.

Japan reaffirmed its close co-operation with South Korea on solving the
North Korean nuclear dispute during a weekend meeting between the two
countries' leaders in Seoul.
The visit by Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the new Japanese prime minister, was
meant to calm worries in South Korea that his position as leader of the
Japanese Social Democratic party, which has supported North Korea, would
affect relations with Seoul.
He urged North Korea to abandon its nuclear programme and end its isolation.
Mr Murayama promised that Japan would not pursue diplomatic relations with
North Korea until suspicions about its nuclear programme were removed. Tokyo
would also consult Seoul on any negotiations Pyongyang.
Japan is willing to provide financial assistance for the supply of safe
light-water nuclear reactors to North Korea once the nuclear issue is
solved, Mr Murayama said.
In an attempt to improve relations with Seoul, Mr Murayama repeated recent
apologies by Japan over Tokyo's harsh colonial rule of Korea between 1910
and 1945.
The new Japanese government has offered to spend Dollars 1bn (Pounds 645m)
on programmes to improve ties with South Korea, as compensation for the
forced recruitment of Korean women as military prostitutes during the second
world war.
But South Korea appeared to be cautious about the proposal, indicating
instead that it favoured direct payments by Japan to the women.
President Kim Young-sam asked that Japan also take measures to reduce
Seoul's trade deficit with Tokyo, which is expected to increase to Dollars
10bn this year from Dollars 8.5bn in 1993 because of the strong yen.

FT  25 JUL 94 / International Press Review: European parliament prompts pain

EUROPE
The distinctive aspect of the French press and political establishment's
reaction to last week's installation of the new European parliament has not
been their direct comment about Strasbourg's new powers.
French newspapers and politicians have joined those of other European
countries in making the commonplace assessment that the narrow vote of
approval for Mr Jacques Santer as the next Commission president shows the
new MEPs intend to use to the maximum their powers under the Maastricht
treaty.
Despite the low standing that parliaments in general, and the European one
in particular, have traditionally in the French mind, the feeling is that a
strong Euro-parliament is inevitable, and, maybe now, even desirable.
The real French moan is about the splintering of France's 87 MEPs into no
fewer than seven groups at Strasbourg, and the possibility that this
dispersal means that France will not be able to make its voice heard.
Most of the fragmentation was a consequence of the proportional system that
France uses for European elections. But there was a hope among some on the
government side that the 29 MEPs who won election on the government's
RPR-UDF coalition ticket would sit in the same Christian Democrat group of
the European Peoples Party.
In the event, only 13 UDF made it to the EPP, one stayed behind with the
Liberals, and the 14 Gaullists decided to keep some Irish nationalists
company, for fear the EPP might be too federalist for them.
So, the UDF turned to the press to express its anger. Its leader,
ex-President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, complained to Liberation that, with
only 13 French members in it, there could not possibly be a French candidate
for the parliament's presidency which will be filled by someone from the EPP
in two and a half years' time.
In Le Figaro Mr Jean-Francois Poncet contrasted this with the way that
German MEPs were concentrated in Strasbourg's two big groups, the EPP and
the Socialists. The result, he said, would be that a German Christian
Democrat would in 1997 succeed the new German socialist president of the
parliament. 'French cacophony, German pre-eminence,' he commented.
There was no such disgruntled comment from the German press. The liberal
Frankfurter Rundschau described the debate over Mr Santer's confirmation as
'a great moment in Strasbourg.' The new deputies, the newspaper argued, gave
'a warning to Brussels, its bureaucrats, and European governments that it
can no longer be taken for granted. Strasbourg has demanded more democracy
from European governments' and must continue to strengthen the European
parliament.
Handelsblatt, the economic and business daily, went further, arguing that
the 'system of consensus' for electing the president of the European
Commission must be changed, implying that in the end Strasbourg had been
faced with a compromise candidate thanks to Britain's veto. The Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung, the conservative daily, and firm supporter of Mr
Jean-Luc Dehaene, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's original candidate for the top EU
post, believed another positive aspect emerged from Strasbourg.
It showed that Germany's governing conservatives and opposition social
democrats could transcend party loyalties and work together to secure the
election of Mr Santer. However, it too warned that Brussels will have to
face the European parliamentarians next December when the deputies
scrutinise the credentials of the new commissioners.
The European parliament is the 'Cinderella' who is now 'knocking at the
door', said El Pas, Spain's leading newspaper, in an editorial welcoming the
assembly's close vote over the appointment of Mr Santer.
The newspaper said that there were now three powers on the EU horizon: 'a
Council of Ministers that seems to want to control institutional democracy;
a Commission that has to redefine somewhat its role but which would do well
not to consider itself a mere executive appendix to the Council; and a
Parliament that we now know has no intention of letting itself be treated as
the Cinderella of European institutions.'

FT  25 JUL 94 / Mouse determined to get bear off its back: John Lloyd
reports from Tallinn on how tiny Estonia is trying to settle differences
with its giant neighbour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Asked if he thinks the Russian troops will leave his country by the deadline
date of August 31, Estonia's president says: 'I think they will go on the
32nd of August.' By which the quixotic Mr Lennart Meri means the troops will
not be pushed, but will go, a view widely held in the tiny country jammed
against the Baltic Sea by a vast state whose most visible politicians employ
a barrage of fearsomely chauvinistic rhetoric.
'Look, they will go,' says Ms Riina Kionka, head of policy planning at the
foreign ministry. And, though the Russian defence ministry said last
Thursday that it would stop the steady pull-out, Mr Raul Malk, Estonian
chief negotiator with the Russians, said on Friday that 'our information is
that it is still going on'.
Everything about these negotiations is small - the number of troops, the
size of Estonia itself (1.6m people) and the issues which divide the two
sides. It is, however, large in that it is taken by the world's leading
states as a symbol of Russia's willingness to abide by a declared intent to
withdraw; to face down domestic nationalist pressures; and to recognise, in
actions if not yet in words, that the Soviet occupation of the three Baltic
states in 1940 and their post-war absorption into the USSR was an act of
illegal occupation.
After the last round of talks, between Mr Malk and the Russian deputy
foreign minister, Mr Vitaly Churkin, in Helsinki last week, the differences
on the military issue - according to the Estonian minister  - narrowed to
three. Two of these concerned the time required to leave the submarine base
at Paldiski and whether Estonian or Russian troops guard it. The third, the
most touchy, concerns the payment of pensions to, and continue residence of,
some 10,000 former Soviet officers now in Estonia.
The main problem with the pensioners is that some officers, according to Mr
Malk, are former or even present KGB officers 'who have taken active part in
organisations which are hostile to the Estonian state'. The Estonians will
not pay them pensions, in part because they are too young, and more
important because they believe many of them to be a fifth column in their
midst. 'It would be better for the Russians to take them out now because, if
they stayed, sooner or later some of them will be called to trial for crimes
against Estonia,' said Mr Malk.
Mr Churkin - among the most famed of Russia's diplomats because of his
shuttle diplomacy as his country's main negotiator with the Bosnian Serbs -
appeared on Russian television on Saturday evening to say that he hoped the
Estonian side would 'reconsider its position' before a meeting between the
two countries' presidents, mooted by Mr Boris Yeltsin two weeks ago but as
yet not fixed. 'It is up to them to ask,' says Mr Meri, 'and they have not
asked yet.'
Even if, as seems likely, the troop pull-out is agreed, two other issues
remain. The Estonians claim two thin slices of Russian territory  - the area
around Ivangorod, opposite the Estonian town of Narva in the north-east; and
the area around Pskov in the south-east. These, they claim, were recognised
as part of Estonia in the 1920 Estonian-USSR Treaty of Tartu. And since
present-day Estonia has affirmed its succession from the inter-war republic
and Russia has claimed to be the inheritor of Soviet treaties, its terms
must be recognised. the more so since the claim to these pieces of land is
enshrined in the new Estonian constitution.
Second, as Mr Malk stresses, Estonia wants a formal recognition by Russia
that the Soviet occupation was illegal and the acts of murder and
deportation criminal. Says Mr Meri: 'I think Russia wants to forget its own
history. I see no reason why Russia should admit its guilt before the
Czechs, the Poles and others and not before our small nation.'
Ms Kionka admits that the inscribing of territorial claims puts Estonian
politicians 'between a rock and a hard place', between the commitment to and
the desire of the people for a restitution, and a Russia which has
unilaterally strengthened the border. Compromises are possible, however, one
being to sign a treaty recognising the pre-war Tartu treaty borders and then
immediately conclude a new treaty redrawing them along the present line. But
that would take trust and goodwill.
Relations between the elephant and the mouse will depend on the willingness
and ability of the 500,000-plus Russian speakers in Estonia to become
citizens of the new state; and the continued existence in power of a Russian
government more interested in being an accepted member of the international
community than in re-asserting empire.
At present, says Ms Kionka, some 40,000 Russians have applied to leave the
country and 60,000 have applied for citizenship. The main qualification for
the latter is a language test described as simple: proficiency in basic
conversation and residence of at least two years. 'The main problem', says
Ms Kionka, 'is with Russians who live in all-Russian communities and never
naturally speak Estonian.'
What Estonians see as Russian great-power attitudes towards Estonia have
been on display in the past few weeks. Mr Yeltsin said at the Group of Seven
summit in Naples that troops would not be withdrawn on August 31 - a
statement repeated last week by General Pavel Grachev, defence minister,
while negotiations were going on. In an interview in Izvestiya, General
Alexander Lebed, commander of the 14th Army and the most popular military
man, warned Estonia that it was in too weak a position to argue.
Estonia is the economic success story of the former Soviet Union. It has a
stable currency (the kroon) pegged to the D-Mark; gross national product
growth of around 5 per cent; low inflation; trade largely re-oriented to the
west; and obvious signs of enrichment, especially in Tallinn. This, it
seems, will be the larger determinant: the attraction for Russian-Estonians
to pledge loyalty and an example which Russia should wish to emulate rather
than to trust. In spite of the rhetoric of tension, Estonia expects reality
to improve.

news agency reported yesterday. Of the total, 83.79 per cent or Dollars
70.027bn was middle and long-term debt and 16.21 per cent or Dollars 13.54bn
was short-term, according to a report by the state administration of foreign
exchange control. Financial institutions, including banks, were the biggest
borrowers, accounting for 50 per cent of the total, the agency said. China's
foreign debt service ratio last year stood at 9.7 per cent and debt ratio at
94.52 per cent, the report said.
The World Bank is expected to lend China about Dollars 3bn to finance
construction of 15 projects in the next fiscal year, which begins in August,
the official China Daily reported.

Zaire's new government, alarmed by the collapse of the national currency,
ordered the immediate suspension of the central bank governor and an audit
of the Bank of Zaire. The decision to suspend governor Mr Ndiang Kaboul, an
appointee of President Mobutu Sese Seko who had held the post since
February, was announced on national television by Mr Masegabio Nzanzu,
information minister, at the end of a six-hour cabinet meeting. He cited
what he described as serious failings and Mr Ndiang's violation of
government instructions over the running of the bank.
In the past couple of weeks billions of newly-minted Zaire notes have
flooded on to the black market, sending the zaire into a steep slide against
foreign currencies and forcing steep rises in the price of consumer goods.
Launched last October at the rate of three to the dollar, the zaire has
fallen to 1,300.

Senegal said last night it had granted political asylum to ousted Gambian
president Sir Dawda Jawara who had arrived in Dakar on a US warship. Earlier
the warship had steamed out of Banjul, the capital of neighbouring Gambia,
while the leader of the coup which toppled Sir Dawda received ambassadors
and religious leaders. Coup leader Lieut Yayeh Jameh was reported to have
told the latter that he and Sir Dawda had failed to agree terms for the
president's return. Sir Dawda fled after young army officers announced a
coup against him on Saturday after what began as a rampage through Banjul by
soldiers demanding back pay. Officials said 10 Nigerian officers working
with the military had been put under house arrest. They included the former
commander of the 800-strong Gambian army, Col Boubakar Dada, who was
preparing to leave Gambia. Banjul was calm, the market was open and people
were going about their business normally. An overnight curfew was in force.

Germany's auditing office has criticised the mounting costs of the European
fighter aircraft, a joint project by Germany, Britain, Spain and Italy,
according to a leaked report obtained by the DPA newsagency. The third
internal report by the office to the finance committee of the lower house of
parliament compares the quality of the Eurofighter to the capability and
efficiency of Russian MiG 29s. It coincides with a continuing dispute
between Germany's politicians and industrialists about how to finance the
project which is already behind schedule. Deutsche Aerospace, the German
industrial partner in the project is seeking an extra DM1.2bn (Pounds 495m)
from public funds, but the defence ministry is hesitant at providing extra
financing. The project, which is expected to cost DM30bn, is running two
years behind schedule. Britain and Italy expect to take delivery of the
fighter aircraft in 2000, Spain in 2001 and Germany in 2002.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Repeat elections yesterday failed to fill the remaining quarter of Ukraine's
new parliament because of a low turnout. Preliminary results showed that
only 57 of the 112 districts surpassed the 50 per cent turnout threshold.
'It was a beautiful day. People were at their dachas concentrating on their
garden plots.' said Mr Yaropolk Kulchyckyj, Kiev head of the
Washington-based International Foundation for Electoral Systems. 'This is
the fifth time, they're tired of elections. Many people didn't even know
that elections were taking place.' Ukraine has been conducting a complete
democratic transfer of leadership from president down to councillors. The
result crushed hopes that democrats and moderates might be able to wrest
control of the 450-seat body from the Communists and their left-wing allies.
The empty seats are a result of Ukraine's inefficient electoral law, which
only managed to elect 338 deputies in two rounds of voting last March and
April. Further repeat elections for the invalid districts will need to be
rescheduled for later this year. In most of the 57 valid districts,
elections will still have to go to a second round run-off on August 7.

Air traffic controllers in Aix-en-Provence warned yesterday that service to
and across the Mediterranean would only return to normal some time this
morning after their three-day strike climaxed yesterday, a peak day for
people ending as well as starting their holidays. A spokesman for the
striking controllers said the average delay on flights from northern Europe
to the Mediterranean was five hours. But some holiday-makers were worse hit,
with 5,000 forced to spend Saturday night camped at the airport of Palma in
Majorca, and with services to the island of Corsica also severely disrupted.
Aix-en-Provence, one of France's five control centres, normally handles
2,400 flights a day. Its 11 controllers have been refusing to do overtime
since July 11, and on Friday started a three-day strike, though they are
required by law to provide a minimum service, allowing 50 per cent of
flights through. But Nice airport said yesterday only 40 per cent of its
scheduled flights were operating. The Aix controllers are demanding 26 more
staff, shorter working hours and better pay. Despite rules that a controller
should not have to guide more than 12 flights at a time, Aix controllers
claim they are having to deal with more than 20.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Obituary: 'First lady' among German industrialists - Grete
Schickedanz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Grete Schickedanz, known as the 'first lady' in German industry, died last
Saturday, aged 82, her family said yesterday.
'She was an outstanding personality among German industry,' said Mr Edmund
Stoiber, prime minister of Bavaria and a prominent member of the Christian
Social Union, the sister party of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing
Christian Democrats. 'She had ideas and concepts, and she forms a part of
Germany's, and Europe's, economic history.' Mr Richard von Weizsacker, the
former federal president, described her as 'the First Lady of German
industry'.
As head of Quelle, Germany's - and Europe's - largest mail-order house,
there was hardly a day this indefatigable lady did not take an interest in
business. She was present when, in 1991, Quelle laid the foundation stone
for its huge branch in Leipzig, in the eastern state of Saxony. Donned in
furs and pearls, and flanked by Mr Kohl, she mused loudly that DM1bn (Pounds
400m) was a lot to invest in Leipzig, and wondered if the company could
afford it. An aide was said to have replied quickly: 'Of course we have the
money]' Quelle last year had a turnover of DM17bn. Since unification, it has
invested more than DM2.5bn in eastern Germany, and is considered one of
Germany's most successful privately-run businesses.
Born in Furth, Bavaria, on October 20, 1911, Grete Lachner - her maiden name
 -started in retailing at the age of 15 by joining Quelle, a company with a
staff of five founded by Gustav Schickedanz, who was born in 1895. The
coupled married in June 1942.
During the 1930s, the company expanded rapidly, despite rampant inflation
and unemployment. When the second world war broke out, Quelle had an annual
turnover of 40m Reichmarks. Despite Allied bombing of its warehouses and its
headquarters in Furth, near Nuremberg, the couple decided to set up business
again in 1946. The business steadily regained its market share.
It soon became the largest, most modern mail-order company in Germany,
priding itself on quality for money and its fast and reliable service.
Grete Schickedanz was also driven by a social conscience. At the end of the
war, she founded a textile business to provide basic necessities for those
whose homes had been destroyed.
With Mrs Schickedanz at the helm, the group diversified in the 1960s and
1970s, particularly in film processing, fashion and furniture, and set up
optician outlets throughout Germany. When her husband died in March 1977,
Mrs Schickedanz continued to manage the business, rarely missing an
opportunity to shape its direction, especially after German unification. She
was helped by her two sons-in-law, Hans Dedi and Wolfgang Buhler, the
current chairman.

Elections to fill the final third of Ukraine's new parliament were held
yesterday. If the remaining 112 seats are won by democrats and moderates,
they could wrest control of the 450-seat body from the Communists and their
left-wing allies. However, democratic organisations have failed to present a
united campaign. 'The democrats have not learned their lessons,' said Mr
Yaropolk Kulchyckyj, Kiev head of the US-based International Foundation for
Electoral Systems. 'They are again fighting against each other. Communists
can slip through into the lead.' The empty seats are a result of Ukraine's
inefficient electoral law, which only managed to elect 338 MPs in two rounds
of voting last March and April. Many of the vacant seats are in metropolitan
districts, often empty at weekends which could mean a low turnout. With nine
candidates on average per district, even the central election commission has
predicted these elections will go to a second round on August 7.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Waigel says US economic conditions are right for dollar
recovery
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Economic developments in the US had paved the way for the dollar to recover
on foreign exchange markets after hitting postwar lows, Mr Theo Waigel,
German finance minister, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Bonn.
Mr Waigel also talked up the D-Mark, saying one of the key successes of the
Bonn government in the past few years had been to been to guide the currency
through unification without suffering excessively high inflation.
Speaking on German radio, Mr Waigel dismissed fears that long-term interest
rates in Europe were bound to follow rising long-term rates in the US.
'There is a certain decoupling and I could imagine that if developments in
Germany continue - clear financial and anti-inflationary policies - then an
even stronger decoupling from American interest rates is possible,' he said.
Sending a clear signal to financial markets, Mr Waigel said the government
was drafting tax reforms for the period after the October 16 elections. But
he stressed that Bonn would not raise the federal deficit to finance tax
cuts. 'Tax cuts which lead to higher federal and state budget deficits would
have to be paid for with higher interest rates and negative consequences on
capital markets,' he said.
Changes in the tax structure would be aimed at lowering tax burdens for
families, boosting exemptions for low wage earners and easing corporate
taxes. Mr Waigel also said he favoured gradually phasing out the so-called
solidarity tax - 7.5 per cent surcharge on income tax bills to help finance
unification - once economic conditions permitted.
Germany would also promote a European-wide withholding tax on interest
earnings, but added that he did not expect EU ministers to reach agreement
soon. 'It can hardly be expected that we will find a solution in the next
half-year. But it is important to raise this issue,' he said.

FT  25 JUL 94 / German interest rate cuts 'ending'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The period of falling German interest rates is drawing to a close, according
to one of the Bonn government's most senior independent advisers.
Prof Herbert Hax said on radio yesterday that the economy had improved so
much that further cuts in short-term rates were unnecessary; the Bundesbank
also had to be careful to protect its credibility. He added that the recent
weakness of the dollar did not reflect real economic conditions in the US.
The Bundesbank last week appeared relaxed about recent rapid growth in the
M3 money supply measure, saying the raw figures overstated the case.
However, Prof Hax, who is chairman of the government's council of economic
advisers, believed the inflationary danger from M3 expansion to be too
great.
As long as money supply was not under control, the most markets could expect
were quite small interest rate corrections, he said. 'It is possible that we
will have a further small reduction in the course of the winter. But I have
the impression that we will soon arrive at the end of interest rate cuts.'
Many private sector economists still believe the internationally important
discount rate will be down from 4.5 per cent to 4 per cent by the end of the
year, with more easing possible if inflation falls further in early 1995.
However, pressure from outside Germany for more cuts has eased, and the
export-led economic recovery appears to be progressing smoothly. If these
conditions continue, the bank could elect to extend the pause instituted
after its unexpected mid-May reduction in the discount rate.
This cut, made while money supply was apparently expanding at an excessive
rate, was interpreted by many observers as an uncharacteristic gamble. A
pause to allow closer analysis of any inflationary dangers in the M3
distortions could also serve to restore the bank's shaken credibility.
Opinions differ on the timing of possible changes, but action at the bank's
next council meeting, due on August 18 is generally considered unlikely.
Any cut too close to the federal elections in mid-October might draw charges
of political motivation since Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, and
Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, his deputy, are close associates of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl. However, relaxing rates after the elections might tempt trade
union pay negotiators to table inflationary demands in the 1995 pay round,
due to start in November.
The Bundesbank has consistently warned that pay and public spending must be
kept under tight control for several more years.
Prof Hax gave a similar warning yesterday. The German economy might be
poised on the brink of a spell of growth lasting 'four or five years or
more,' he said. But to remain competitive it was important that unions and
employers reached 'rational' pay settlements.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Hutu refugees begin return journey to Rwanda: US army denies
claims that food drops were off-target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The tide of Rwandan Hutus seeking refuge in Zaire began to turn at the
weekend, with thousands heading home as cholera took hold in the camps along
the border, where up to 1,500 a day were estimated to be dying.
Three US military aircraft yesterday made the first drops in a planned
mission to bring food to refugees. A US army spokesman in Stuttgart said the
drops, north of the border town of Goma, had been successful and he denied
claims by aid workers that they had been off-target. Ms Alison Campbell, of
the aid organisation Care, said the operation was 'a waste of time and
resources of busy people in an emergency'.
The air drops followed a visit to Goma by Mr Kengo wa Dondo, Zaire's prime
minister, during which he reopened the frontier which had been closed since
Thursday. Refugees cheered and some crossed back into Rwanda.
Their return will be crucial to the new government installed last week in
the capital Kigali by the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front, leaders
of which say their top priority is convincing the more than 2m Hutus who
have fled that their lives will not be under threat if they return.
Those who are dying in Goma from thirst, hunger, cholera or exhaustion fled
in fear of RPF reprisals for the genocide of the Tutsis conducted by the
former Hutu government.
'The international community must help us persuade refugees they will be
safe back home,' Rwanda's new prime minister, Mr Faustin Twagiramungu -
himself a Hutu - said. The former rebels of the RPF have taken pains to
appoint a mixed Hutu-Tutsi government to win the support of the majority
Hutu population. As well as the prime minister, his deputy, the president
and the justice minister are ethnic Hutus, and say they reject Rwanda's
ethnic divisions.
The new government promises to abolish the Rwandan identity card, which
identified the holder as belonging to the Hutu, Tutsi or pigmy Twa ethnic
group.
As part of the aid effort, Israel said yesterday it was airlifting a field
hospital, doctors and medical supplies to Goma.
However, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and all relief agencies say
the only solution to the humanitarian catastrophe in Goma is the voluntary
repatriation of Hutu refugees. Mr Michel Moussalli, a special UNHCR envoy,
said: 'We need expatriates, non-government organisations, UN military
observers - the more the better.'
However, there were reports at the weekend of disappearances, blamed on RPF
forces in Kigali. Mrs Philomene Mukabarali, wife of former ambassador and
moderate Hutu politician Mr Silvestre Kamali, said yesterday her husband had
been abducted at an RPF road block in Kigali 10 days ago. The RPF denies
holding him.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Sinn Fein dismisses Ulster proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, WILLIAM LEWIS and JOHN MCMANUS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON,, LETTERKENNY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government signalled last night that it would press ahead with the
search for a deal between Ulster's constitutional parties after Sinn Fein
dismissed the Downing Street declaration as inadequate.
The rejection by a Sinn Fein national delegate conference appeared to
confirm the London government's view that Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein's
president, cannot persuade IRA hard-liners to call a cessation of violence.
Amid anger and disappointment in London, British officials made clear that
until there was a renunciation of violence there was no question of
involving Sinn Fein in talks aimed at establishing a new political
settlement in Northern Ireland.
Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, hope to
produce in September a framework document for such a settlement. Officials
were dismissive of Sinn Fein's demand that the London and Dublin governments
move further to 'clarify' the Downing Street declaration by diluting the
veto of the unionists in Ulster over constitutional change.
Mr Reynolds warned the response would mean continued terrorist violence.
But he added: 'Some positive signals have emanated from the convention. The
reservations expressed about the Downing Street declaration come as no real
surprise at this stage. What is essential now is that all paramilitary
organisations should stop the killing.'
In its first formal response to the declaration, Sinn Fein described it as
inadequate, but said that it would work to overcome the obstacles. It said
the declaration was a 'step in the peace process' but did not 'deal
adequately with some of the core issues and this is crucial'.
Speaking last night at the delegate conference, called to approve the
governing executive's response to the declaration, Mr Adams said Sinn Fein
had 'recommitted itself today to constructing this foundation, by building
on the positive elements of the Downing Street declaration and by seeking to
overcome the difficulties'.
However, Mr Adams stopped far short of calling on the IRA to end its
campaign of violence, ending hopes that Sinn Fein would be able to take part
in cross party talks that the UK and Irish governments hope will start this
autumn. The Downing Street declaration offered a place at the negotiating
table to Sinn Fein if it formally and permanently renounced violence.
Ahead of the conference, held amid tight security in the border town of
Letterkenny in the Republic of Ireland, there had been growing optimism that
it would decide to call on the IRA to announce a summer ceasefire. But Mr
Adams said yesterday the IRA would make its own decision on a ceasefire.
Sinn Fein listed 10 aspects of the Downing Street declaration about which it
was unhappy, including the so-called unionist veto over any changes in the
constitutional status of Northern Ireland.
Mr David Winnick, the Labour vice-chairman of the Anglo-Irish parliamentary
association said he was 'bitterly disappointed' by Sinn Fein's response.

FT  25 JUL 94 / Berlusconi faces new challenge on corruption
</HEADLINE>

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italian anti-corruption magistrates issued a new challenge at the weekend to
the government of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, ordering a string of arrests of
prominent businessmen and politicians including two executives at Fininvest,
the prime minister's media empire.
The move cast a further cloud over the stability of Mr Berlusconi's
10-week-old rightwing coalition. It also raised the prospect of a damaging
battle between the executive branch of government and the judiciary at a
time when many commentators believe the magistrates have adopted too
political a role.
Attention yesterday centred on the activities of the Milan magistrates. But
in Catania, Sicily, magistrates also made a high-profile move when they
arrested three of the best-known local politicians for alleged corruption -
including Mr Salvo Ando, a former Socialist defence minister, and Mr Rino
Nicolosi, the former Christian Democrat head of the Sicilian regional
government.
The arrest warrants came five days after the government backed down on
issuing a decree that limited powers of investigating magistrates to use
preventive detention. The Milan magistrates, the most prominent
anti-corruption team in Italy, had threatened to resign unless the decree
was withdrawn and its terms redrafted to be made less restrictive.
When the decree was approved by the cabinet on July 13, the Milan
magistrates were preparing a series of arrest warrants for prominent
businessmen allegedly involved in paying bribes to members of the Guardia di
Finanza, the financial police, for favourable tax assessments and compliant
inspections of company balance sheets. Last week 49 of these warrants were
issued and another 23 late on Saturday.
The warrants covered two men in Fininvest's tax department - Mr Marco Rizzi,
former member of the Guardia di Finanza, and Mr Salvatore Sciascia, the
department's head. Mr Sciascia's lawyer said he would hand himself over
shortly but last night he had not been located. Other prominent names on the
arrest list included Mr Felice Vitali, the chief executive of Gemina, the
finance group that controls the Rizzoli-Corriere della Sera publishing
empire controlled by Fiat.
Milan magistrates have been investigating several aspects of Fininvest's
operations, from the granting of television licences to illicit football
transfer fee payments. The magistrates have hinted that the present line of
inquiry is the most serious so far.
Almost 20 members of the Guardia di Finanza are under arrest and
co-operating with investigators. In less than a month, three of its members
have committed suicide. Those co-operating with magistrates have reportedly
said there was an organised system of payments that enabled companies to
enjoy low tax assessments and square their public balance sheets with their
'real' accounts.

FT  25 JUL 94 / UK companies still sceptical on lower inflation, says CBI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most British companies have not adjusted their investment criterion for low
inflation and interest rates, in spite of warnings from the government that
this is stifling investment, a new business survey has found.
The Confederation of British Industry survey shows many companies still
demand that investment projects should either yield a rate of return above
20 per cent, or else pay back the investment within three years.
Most companies assume the government will not deliver its inflation target.
Their average prediction for inflation when considering investment projects
is 5 per cent, compared with the government's target of bringing it below
2.5 per cent by the end of the parliament.
The survey is likely to fuel the government's appeals to companies to lower
inflation expectations to boost investment, currently running at relatively
modest levels in spite of the overall pick-up in manufacturing.
The report says that uncertainty about demand appears to be the key
constraint for business investment, although it admits that companies'
scepticism about inflation is a factor.
The report, which surveyed almost 500 manufacturing companies, found that
two-fifths of companies that use a nominal or real rate of return to assess
investment projects want a return in excess of 20 per cent. Two-thirds of
firms that use 'payback' assessment want periods of two to three years.
The pattern varies, with almost one-third of companies using a nominal rate
of return prepared to accept a return of less than 11 per cent. One-fifth of
companies using this method have lowered investment expectations in the
light of low inflation.
However, the investment appraisal has remained unchanged among two-thirds of
companies using a payback assessment and half of those using real rates of
return.
Mr Sudhir Junankar, CBI associate director for economic analysis, said the
results showed that 'long-term investment in the UK still depends largely on
the achievement of a more stable macro-economic environment.'
The Bank of England welcomed the survey as 'bearing out' the results of its
own informal survey of companies.
Mr Eddie George, the Bank's governor, warned at the weekend that 'very
profitable' investment opportunities were being missed because of industry's
failure to adjust to the new low inflation environment.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Property: Results reflect London's strength - Cadogan's
Place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Results from Savills and John D. Wood, for the year ended April 30, reflect
the strength of the London property market. Savills' pre-tax profits
increased 125 per cent, from Pounds 1.44m to Pounds 3.24m, with the
agricultural and residential side contributing Pounds 1.19m (Pounds 458,000)
thanks to firmer London and farmland markets. Foreigners made up more than
40 per cent of the buyers in London.
Wood reports pre-tax profits of Pounds 681,000, against a Pounds 291,000
loss the year before. London turnover was more than 50 per cent higher, and
near the peak of 1987-88, while country and agricultural turnover rose 24
per cent. The price inflation rate in central London has been around 20 per
cent in the past 18 months.
A report from Cluttons reveals an average central London price rise of 10.3
per cent in the year to June 1994, with roughly a fifth of that coming in
the second quarter of this year. Houses increased more than flats.
Fulham and Pimlico have risen more - proportionately speaking - than
Knightsbridge and Kensington; indeed, the short supply of houses in Fulham
led to an average annual increase of 16.3 per cent, which is almost twice as
much as for flats (8.2).
Handsome price, handsome flat . . . agent de Groot Collis (071-235 8090) is
seeking offers of more than Pounds 2m for the 28-year lease of a
ground-floor Knightsbridge apartment in Cadogan Square, SW1. Besides use of
the garden in the square, it opens on to a shared garden at the back of the
terrace. But its treat is spectacular joinery: French oak floors and deep
mahogany in one bathroom. The other has burr maple, even on the lavatory
seat and the ceiling. A huge mirror emphasises the beautiful grain of the
wood - and the sense of being in your own early-18th century cabinet.
The major part of a Gloucestershire village manor house with three acres of
grounds and gardens is being offered for sale, freehold, by Butler Sherborn
of Burford, Oxfordshire. (Tel: 0993-822325). It is looking for offers of
Pounds 395,000 for the seven-bedroom property on the edge of Kencot, a
Cotswold stone village, 14 miles from Swindon and 22 miles from Oxford. The
house, listed grade II, is believed to date to the early 17th century.
Lovers of Victorian architecture are offered a rare opportunity at Ramsgate,
Kent. The Grange, built by architect and writer AW Pugin early in the 1840s,
is for sale, coinciding with an exhibition about him at the Victoria and
Albert Museum in London. This house was a revolt against the
classical/Georgian tradition in domestic architecture, and affected design
for decades.
In brick and stone, it has three floors and an imposing tower with views
over Ramsgate harbour to the Channel. The stained glass in the chapel
includes saints Augustine and Gregory, plus Pugin and his wife and family.
The price is Pounds 300,000 from Knight Frank &amp; Rutley in Tunbridge Wells
(0892-515 035).
At South Holmwood near Dorking, Surrey, a house designed by Sir Edwin
Lutyens in the Dutch style is on offer for Pounds 400,000 from John D. Wood
(071-493 4106). Called The Dutch House, it has an unusual Y-plan.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Railtrack defiant on strike-day services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rail users can expect a slightly better service during next week's 48-hour
stoppage than during last week's one-day strike, Railtrack, the state-owned
company responsible for the railway infrastructure, said yesterday.
Mr John Ellis, Railtrack's production director, was questioned by the
Central Rail Users Committee, the official watchdog of rail travellers, at a
scheduled meeting in London where he expressed little optimism for a quick
resolution of the signal workers' dispute.
He said: 'We are anticipating that we should be able to provide a very
similar, if not improved service.'
Mr Ellis said 30 per cent of the normal weekday rail network would be
available during the strike period, which begins from noon next Tuesday.
This will mean about a quarter of normal weekday trains operating, although
a number will be special shuttle services with less capacity than usual.
He hinted that contacts had been established between Mr Bob Horton,
Railtrack chairman, and Dr Brian Mawhinney, the new transport secretary. He
said: 'I personally have not had contacts with him but there has been some
initial contact with the new secretary of state.'
There has been speculation about a breakthrough in negotiations next week.
Mr Ellis, who did not rule out talks this weekend at Acas, the arbitration
and conciliation service, said he could not say when the dispute would end.
RMT, the transport union, wants an 'up-front' pay rise for past productivity
improvements before it will agree to talks on restructuring signalling work.
Railtrack wants a binding agreement on such discussions before it will talk
about any such payment.
On the safety of managers and supervisors operating signals during the
strikes, Mr Ellis said: 'There is absolutely no compromise on safety. I
deplore what RMT have been doing in raising totally unnecessary fears about
this issue.'
The Health and Safety Executive confirmed that its inspectors had made spot
checks this week during the strike.
The executive said: 'In none of these instances were there grounds for the
inspectors taking enforcement action.'

The table shows capital gains tax indexation allowances for assets sold in
June.
Multiply the original cost of the asset by the figure for the month in which
you bought it. Subtract the result from the proceeds of your sale; the
balance will be your taxable gain or loss.
Suppose you bought shares for Pounds 6,000 in September 1985 and sold them
in June 1994 for Pounds 13,000. Multiplying the original cost by the
September 1985 figure of 1.516 gives a total of Pounds 9,096.
Subtracting that from Pounds 13,000 gives a capital gain of Pounds 3,904
which is within the CGT allowance of Pounds 5,800. If selling shares bought
before April 6 1982, you should use the March 1982 figure. The RPI in June
was 144.7.
The Budget decision that indexation cannot be used to create or increase
losses for shares sold after November 29 1993, has been modified for Pounds
10,000 of transitional relief.

FT  23 JUL 94 / International Company News: Kidder Peabody's Cerullo resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Edward Cerullo, the head of fixed income at Kidder Peabody, yesterday
became the latest senior executive to resign from the troubled US securities
firm.
Kidder was rocked earlier this year by the discovery of what it claims was a
scheme to create fictitious profits of Dollars 350m by Mr Joseph Jett, a
bond trader in Mr Cerullo's division.
Both Kidder and Mr Cerullo depicted yesterday's resignation as a voluntary
act, not linked to a failure to supervise Mr Jett properly. In a statement,
Mr Cerullo said that he was leaving because, 'given the events of recent
months, I believe new management is best served by having its own team in
place'.
Asked whether it had asked for the resignation, Kidder said: 'This is an
independent decision by Ed Cerullo.' The resignation was 'solely due to the
reason stated' by Mr Cerullo, the company added.
The departure comes just days before the expected publication of an
investigation into the Jett allegations which is being carried out for
Kidder and its parent, General Electric, by Mr Gary Lynch, a former head of
enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission. GE indicated recently
that the report would be completed by early August.
The Lynch report, which has already taken longer to produce than initially
indicated, is expected to examine the adequacy of Kidder's controls in the
light of the allegations surrounding Mr Jett. Given his position as the
person directly responsible for supervising Mr Jett, questions had
inevitably been raised about Mr Cerullo's future at the firm, along with
that of Mr Richard O'Donnell, the company's chief financial officer, who
remains in place.
Kidder's chairman and chief executive, Mr Michael Carpenter, left the firm
at the end of last month, while Mr Michael Keehner, a former head of its
broking operations, resigned a week ago.

I am still trying to dream up a new world game. I have been at work on it
for a fortnight, ever since Miss Lee, my executive assistant, declared that
soccer was hideous - 'just groups of hairy men rolling on the ground' - and
that virtually all sports, especially those with balls, were fundamentally
silly.
She had read that the man who founded Nike - she couldn't remember his name,
but was sure he had a beard - had set himself the target of inventing a new
game. The more I pondered, the firmer grew my belief that Miss Lee and this
man were on to a good thing. Almost all the games we play are unbelievably
silly.
Golf, for example, is one of the stupidest activities devised. You
manufacture a ridiculously small ball and dig an extremely small hole - in
fact 18 tiny holes, separated by thousands of yards of bull-dozered
landscape - and then you build a club-house and sit back and watch as fat,
smug people wearing lilac sweaters and enjoying the complacency of
prosperous middle age waddle up and down your golf course, attempting to
thwack this ball over a pile of displaced peasantry and a pyre of
slaughtered wildlife, into this tiny hole.
They even keep score, and then repair to the clubhouse where they fill their
throats with gin and talk about their incomes and how they're changing the
Jag and isn't Bambi pitiful but it won't mean a thing by the time of the
general election because people aren't stupid and will still vote for Major
who is starting to improve his act.
Study the sports pages of our weightiest organs and you will see that almost
every type of game that could be invented has been invented. The Daily
Telegraph this week even devoted space to the lacrosse World Cup, which is
taking place in England and has attracted, thrillingly, a team of Iroquois
who are said to stand, together with four other teams, 'between England and
glory'.
Miss Lee is right; we need a fresh approach.
One that attracts me is that old sci-fi game, Assassin], in which a trained
killer arrives in some megalopolis and hunts down a human quarry. The event
is televised all day. Tension mounts unbearably. As the hunt progresses, you
do rather wonder if the person the killer is seeking could be your head of
department or even, conceivably, you.
The denouement is covered on the 6pm news. If the quarry escapes, he (or
she) is awarded Pounds 5m. If not, he (or she) dies, right there in
prime-time, garrotted, shall we say, or vaporised by laser-gun.
The victim could be quite ordinary, or someone extremely prominent, such as
the micro-brained individual who permits Queen Elizabeth II to stage garden
parties at Buckingham Palace in the middle of the working week.
This summer, my progress home from work in my six-year-old Rover has been
brought to a halt time and time again by the tumult and scrummaging
occasioned in the Mall and along Constitution Hill by hordes of the socially
mobile leaving Buck House at the end of one of these parties.
It happened again on Tuesday. Traffic in central London ground to a complete
stop - there was already a heatwave raging - as a motley crowd of
party-goers swept from Buckingham Palace and milled about outside. I turned
off my engine and surveyed these appalling people.
A lot of them seemed to be from parts of Britain that we hoped we had heard
the last of - places where ships or cars or other large metal objects used
to be manufactured but which are now reverting to primeval forest, thanks to
the ministrations of the Tories, or have been razed and then manicured into
back-to-back golf courses.
As well as people from the regions, the swell of party-goers in the Mall on
Tuesday included numerous serving officers from our great armed forces -
nuclear submarine captains, cavalry and artillery officers, leaders of
pike-units from the Tower of London and a lieutenant in charge of a
detachment of sad-faced men shouldering arquebuses.
I think Assassin] would be a good game. But I am sure it can be improved on.
By next week I hope to have thought of a better one. If I fail, I will stage
a competition to see whether readers can suggest a new world game that would
satisfy Miss Lee and the man who founded Nike. A prize will be offered -
something really glamorous. Tune in next week.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Private View: Heir to the sins of the fatherland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week he was in Paris with Chancellor Kohl to celebrate Bastille Day and
watch Panzer tanks crawl down the Champs Elysees for the first time since
the Nazi occupation of the French capital.
This week he was star speaker in London at the German embassy's 50th
anniversary 'commemoration' of the bomb plot against Hitler.
Manfred Rommel is much in demand these days. As mayor of Stuttgart he
represents the prosperous liberal democracy of post-war Germany. As son of
Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, the Desert Fox, he is a reminder that even the
Nazi dictatorship had its decent face. As peacemaker he has struck up a
friendship with David, Viscount Montgomery, son of his father's conqueror at
Alamein.
Manfred was 15 and at home with his father when two generals came from
Hitler in October, 1944, to offer the field marshal the opportunity of
committing suicide by poison.
The Desert Fox accepted but not because he was part of the bomb plot.
Although he knew some of the conspirators, said his son, he never believed
they would - or could - act. He took the poison because from the end of 1943
he had been telling Hitler the war was lost, and Hitler discovered Rommel
was prepared to surrender to the Allies if they were victorious in France.
I asked his son if he felt absolved by his father's sacrifice.
'No, I don't want to say that because my father died by order of Hitler he's
a good German and the others who did not die by order were bad Germans. That
would be wrong. The people in general were not responsible. A simple German,
what should he do? Or even a colonel or divisional commander? He was almost
helpless.'
He could resign his command, I said.
'Of course. On the other hand he had responsibility for his troops, for
others.'
What about your father?
'He lived at a time when it was very difficult for a German to remain
honest. Today, it's really difficult not to be honest.'
Do you feel you should apologise for him?
'Yes, of course, I try to explain. I have to admit that in Germany we had
anti-semitism and that Jews were expropriated, ill-treated, discriminated
against. No doubt about that. If it was not accepted it was tolerated.
'And the Army said 'It's not our problem. It's up to the politicians.' And
that was wrong of course. Of course I cannot deny that my father was
fighting for Hitler and was also made field marshal by Hitler, not by
Emperor William II. He also had a special political responsibility.'
Are you ashamed of his attitude, or proud of him as a soldier?
'I'm proud of him as a person. Because I don't know what I would have done
in his place. I would be ashamed of my father if I were absolutely certain
that I in his place would have followed a better way.
'I see him in his time. He tried in Africa to be fair - as far as war can be
fair. He never pursued any Jewish people in Africa and did not carry out
orders from Hitler.' He ignored, for example, an order to kill prisoners of
the British Eighth Army who had been German citizens.
What about yourself? Do you feel at all ashamed that you were in the Hitler
Youth and aspired to the SS?
'No, I don't feel ashamed I was in the Hitler Youth but I feel ashamed and
surprised that there was so little concern in Germany when minorities were
persecuted, and people did not feel solidarity but were attracted by
propaganda and said 'It's none of our business.'
'Many things they didn't know, but many things they did know. This is a
lesson we have to learn about dictatorship.
'And of course I feel ashamed that in the name of Germany millions of people
were killed, that we went to war against Poland and Russia and so on.'
Manfred Rommel ended the war as an anti-aircraft gunner, a 16-year-old
Luftwaffenoberhelfer. Now 65, he has been Christian Democrat mayor of
Stuttgart, the capital of Baden-Wurttemberg, for 20 years. He said he has
tried to work simultaneously for the integration and cultural protection of
the quarter of the city's population who are non-nationals: Greeks,
Yugoslavs and Turks.
'What we have to learn from the time of Hitler is to fight for the interests
of minorities and see them as part of the whole society.'
Do you feel a special responsibility because of Hitler's theories?
'Not because of Hitler. I am clean of Hitler. I feel a special
responsibility because I think it is necessary for the future of Europe  -
especially for a continental country with many frontiers - to be open to
minorities.'
He also thinks it wrong to ignore - as Chancellor Kohl is being accused of
doing - communist survivors of the German resistance movement. 'In Stuttgart
we have many communist families who have lost grandparents in the
concentration camps. I think it would not be decent to exclude them. Their
idea was not to support Stalin, but to fight Hitler.'
Rommel has also been preaching the virtues of forgiveness to colleagues in
former east Germany. There the victims of communist exploitation find his
message hard to swallow, he said. 'But without the tolerance shown by the
German resistance to those who fought with Hitler, German society after the
war would have exploded.'
Do you see dangers in the neo-Nazi movement or even in Germany's economic
success? Will Germany become again dominant and assertive in Europe?
'No, I don't think so. There is no danger from the Nazi movement. We have
some criminals who attack asylum-seekers, and so on. This is true. But this
is no danger for democracy. We will put them in prison. As for ambition, I
don't think so. Germany is almost suffering from the fact that it has become
bigger. It may want everything else, but not to be dominant in Europe.'
Does not unity itself foster a kind of nationalism that could be dangerous
one day?
'I don't think so. Nationalism is almost a little bit discriminated against
because the elder generation is full of distrust.
'And we have a lot of problems. It is not easy to incorporate a former
communist country in a market economy and free democracy. The east saw us as
providing dishwashers and red wine and fruit and holidays in Spain. But now
they see us as we really are and they are very much disappointed by the lack
of solidarity.'
Your generation, I said, is old enough to remember the horrors but too young
to have participated in them. Are you afraid that the younger generation
will not learn the lessons?
'I would ask: what are the lessons? Some lessons are not learned. But never
again will there be National Socialism or anything like that in Germany.
Never.
'What is dangerous is that many people don't see the values of democracy.
They don't accept our kind of democracy or say it's not good enough for
them. This is dangerous because we will have to face many economic and
social problems if we produce more and more with less and less manpower. We
need democracy also in critical times.'
We have another year of anniversaries before the end of the war in Europe, I
said. Will it be a relief when it's over?
'Yes, it will be a relief. We won't stop talking about National Socialism
and the Third Reich because it's really important to draw the lesson from
them. But I hope that there will be less talk about war.'
Are you tired of the responsibility of being your father's son?
'No, I'm not tired. I'm not only my father's son. I have made a career in
administration, in politics. Of course I always felt obliged to argue for my
father.
'We have to face the future but the past is important to learn from. We
cannot change it. But we can interpret it.'

FT  23 JUL 94 / Arts: Epic whimsy gives festival flair - Karen Fricker finds
the offerings at Chicago's theatre festival a mix of the bizarre and boring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chicago seems a natural choice as host city to the only regularly scheduled
festival devoted solely to international theatre in the US. Its bustling
theatre community provides an ample assortment of stages, and its audiences
are eager for new experience.
The eight-year-old International Theatre Festival of Chicago is still
finding its legs. There was a sense of caution this year but the greatest
risk - commissioning an outdoor theatrical extravaganza from the punky Dutch
ensemble Dogtroep - produced the most festive results.
In its evocative venue, a tented amphitheatre on Navy Pier on Lake Michigan,
Dogtroep created Camel Gossip III, a work of epic whimsy that is fresher and
more entertaining than that of comparable new-age circuses - neither as twee
as Cirque du Soleil nor as gratuitously violent as La Fura dels Baus nor as
archly self-conscious as Archaos.
Not much plot here, just a series of images and vignettes: a lumpen,
hard-hatted fellow unexpectedly disgorges a shapely woman from his
coveralls, who proceeds to destroy his shanty house and build a tower from
the wreckage. A dozen white-wigged harpies dangle over the stage in brightly
painted cabinets, then troll the audience sporting bizarre head-dresses,
which amplify their breathing. They then joyride through the audience on
old-fashioned bicycles, a combination rock and oom-pah-pah band serenading
in the background.
Most astoundingly, throughout the proceedings it rains on stage, a gushing
downpour that makes the tempest in An Inspector Calls look like an April
shower. How do they do it? That is just the point; Camel Gossip III is an
exercise in wonder, an enormous and baffling jumpstart to the imagination.
Providing the festival's mainstream bookends were the Gate Theatre of
Dublin's well-travelled production of Juno and the Paycock (which I left too
early to see) and Alan Ayckbourn's latest farce, Communicating Doors, fresh
from its Scarborough premiere.
In theory, it is an enlightened idea to include the work of England's
contemporary comic master in its programme (the Royal Shakespeare Company,
the Renaissance Theatre Company and the National Theatre have been featured
in previous festivals), but a shame that Communicating Doors finds Ayckbourn
so far off form.
A bedroom farce cum murder mystery cum Back to the Future-type time-travel
tale, Communicating Doors links three women from different decades in a plan
to save themselves from a sleazy man - husband to two of the women - who
plans to kill them all.
The action takes place in a very posh hotel room whose inside door serves as
a time portal.
Though the first act is at once silly and confusing, the play transforms
into something richer and more satisfying in the second act, as the women's
manipulations of time turn a growing bond between two of them into a blood
knot. This uneven muddle is made worse by a sluggish production directed by
the playwright himself.
The Attis Theatre Company, a young Greek group, insisted that their two
productions not be translated into English so as not to detract from the
viewing experience. This ended up, in the case of their production of
Aeschylus' The Persians, to be self-defeating. Virtually actionless, the
play consists of long descriptive speeches, as the Persians, waiting for
news of a battle between their troops and the Greeks, learn that their
nation has been brutally defeated, and mourn.
There is an interesting dialogue between classic and contemporary time
periods at play in Theodoros Terzopolous' production. The translation, we
are told in the programme, mixes ancient and modern Greek; the performers'
black gowns make reference to ancient and current styles; and at one point
the performers brandish photographs, perhaps of Gulf War victims but we
never find out. Though the company's work reflects a great seriousness and
physical rigour, without sufficient interpretation of what the words
actually mean, the audience is slighted of a full theatrical ex-perience.
Attis' second production, a contemporary play called The Kanon by Vassilis
Vassikehaylglou, was reportedly more visual and active.
Audiences and critics alike were impressed with the young Mexican ensemble
Taller del Sotano (Basement Workshop), which presented two works in Spanish
with English translation. Robert Lepage's Needles and Opium was another
favourite.
The festival stinted on American offerings - the only entry being two funny
but theatrically slight one-woman shows by the Latina lesbian comedienne
Marga Gomez - but local productions provided a more-than-ample unofficial
fringe to make up for this.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Arts: In praise of a joyful return to the basics - A
controversial artist with the exceptional talent of wit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Helen Chadwick is exceptional. Her uniqueness does not come from 'Piss
Sculptures', the ice artefacts that she moulded by urinating in the Canadian
snow, nor from 'Cacao', a monumental fountain of heaving, shimmering,
bubbling chocolate, a work as stridently sexual as it is coprophiliac as it
is disturbing, which confronts the ears and noses of visitors to Effluvia,
her new exhibition at the Serpentine Gallery. Helen Chadwick is exceptional
because she is witty.
Most contemporary artists have a miserable vision. Their creations either
dwell on the seamy underbelly of life or assume a detached, geometrical,
aversion to reality.
Chadwick rejoices in the basics, using her bodily fluids to give a very
personal application to her work and getting great pleasure from the
commonplace. One of her compositions at the Serpentine consists of a
brilliantly decorative balancing of green marmalade circling lustrous pink
Windolene - it has been bought by the Prudential to hang in its staff
canteen.
The 'Piss Flowers', an army of 12 etched snow scenes, somehow become more
exciting when you realise that Chadwick and her male partner strained hard
in their creation from start to finish.
By happy chance these crepuscular forms also project a sexual image, for, as
the catalogue to the show points out, the cavities formed by the urine,
'strong and hot from the woman, diffuse and cooler from the man' create
shapes that are inversions of human genitalia, penile from the woman, labial
from the man. These are the incidental happenings that, to its supporters,
suggest that God smiles on contemporary art.
Another serendipic pleasure from Effluvia is the catalogue, which wallows in
ponderous, philosophical, gobbledegook to describe what are just wildly
imaginative ideas, cleanly and prettily crafted, and immediately accessible.
If the results are unfashionably decorative, even uplifting in their primary
brightness, Chadwick retains the knack of the avant-garde to shock: Cadbury
was quite happy to supply the chocolate for the volcanic heavings of 'Cacao'
but shied away from a promotional credit. Chadwick is a serious artist but
she does not take her creations too seriously. You can buy 'Cacao', but she
has not yet priced it. Make her an offer - she would settle for a smart BMW.
The Chadwick show will pack them in at the Serpentine, with attendances that
will rival those in the spring of Damien Hirst, who brought in 50,000 ('half
the annual attendance at the Courtauld', points out Julia Peyton-Jones,
director of the Serpentine and passionate advocate of the new).
It should certainly secure Chadwick a nomination for the 1995 Turner Prize,
an honour which strangely eluded Hirst when the 1994 short list was annouced
this week.
One selector suggested that Hirst's work had failed to progress - seen one
mutilated animal, seen them all. Perhaps a mere ability to shock is finally
rumbled as a precarious base on which to build a career as an international
artist.
Whatever the reason the four 1994 finalists - sculptor Antony Gormley,
painter Peter Doig (the first worker in paint to be nominated for five
years), photographer Willie Doherty, and sculptor-installationist Shirazeh
Houshiary - are unexceptional to the point of tedium.
It seems the jury wanted to promote artists who had not yet made the
critical breakthrough, who needed a helping hand. But there is no glimmer of
a 21st-century Master among this quartet.
* There might just be at the Business Design Centre in Islington, where
graduates from many of the nation's art schools are showing, and selling,
their creations. This London showcase is an excellent idea, now firmly
established.
There are still some London postgraduate schools that hold aloof, but more
fool them. Anyone wanting to see where their taxes go, or who wants to buy
the next Hockney for Pounds 50, should rush along. Of course these days the
brightest art students are in love with the market. There is well-produced
promotional literature, with high prices.
I enjoyed the show immensely. It takes hours to work the room. Virtually
every object - and there are hundreds more objects than paintings - needs
deciphering, apart from those that are blatantly sexual or provocatively
daring, like the circle of kneeling white figures in which heads are totally
lost inside bottoms.
In many cases the visitor will miss the point - the large installation piece
of vast metre-long knives, cauldrons, and a soundtrack of orgasmic heavy
breathing suggested a human about to be turned into dinner, but who knows?
Well, perhaps the artist, Lottie Radford, does.
Students still seem to be hooked on the ideas of Duchamp, now about a
century old, and assorted objects are trailed all over the stands. Art in
the traditional sense of drawing, even painting, seems to have been left far
behind.
But at least the ideas - however banal, repetitive and doleful they may be -
seem to be better crafted than in the past. Sam Crook's contemplation on
hair, climaxing with a beautiful, suspended entombed plait; Karl Vickers
papier-mache cow; and of course, the delights of confectionery, the new art
medium. Helen Chadwick has a lot to answer for, but, really, the kids are
all right.
Anyone seeking the middle ground between the banal and the elitist, who
wants to discover where contemporary art for the private collector stands,
should pop into Angela Flowers, Silver Place, Soho, gallery during the next
week.
She has just completed an imaginative fortnight at which daily one
established artist - Eileen Cooper, Glynn Williams - has chosen another
artist whose work they admire and who they feel deserves a wider airing.
Angela Flowers has no control - husbands choose wives, teachers their
professors, but the results, comprising one piece by each selected artist
and priced between Pounds 200 and Pounds 1,500, give an insider's view of
art now.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Arts: Striking Chagall - Richard Fairman visits
Schleswig-Holstein
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most striking image at this year's Schleswig-Holstein festival comes
courtesy of Chagall. A mural displays a colourful world populated by
strangely dislocated figures, including dancers performing physically
impossible hand-stands, a one-legged conductor and a violinist without a
head.
This is one of a group of wall paintings originally intended for the Jewish
Theatre in Moscow, left behind when the artist emigrated in 1922 and only
signed in the 1970s.
They have not been seen before in the west and form part of a fascinating
Chagall exhibition at the Schleswig-Holsteinisches Landesmuseum.
The festival was fortunate to have caught the exhibition on its way round
Europe, as it provides a visual counterpart to the year's musical theme.
Musicians and actors, poets and dancers, all the figures in the wall
paintings are Jewish. Two or three years ago, when funding and sponsorship
was easier to come by, Schleswig-Holstein was able to draw up a wide-ranging
programme for the 1994 festival. It was to look at Jewish music from a
variety of standpoints, including works banned during the Third Reich,
visiting Israeli musicians and music by contemporary Israeli composers.
The subject remains a sensitive one. The synagogue in Lubeck, one of the
main towns on the festival's roving itinerary, was recently the target of an
arson attack, and concert venues where Jewish musicians were performing
found themselves guarded by police with alsations.
The first concert last Sunday brought together all the festival's Jewish
sub-themes on one evening. It was given by the Israel Symphony Orchestra
Rishon Lezion, founded in 1988, of which half the musicians are Russian
emigres.
While many professionals arriving from Russia discover that their
qualifications are not accepted in Israel, the main problem for musicians is
to find an orchestra that can provide work, so founding a new one (if the
money can be raised) is the path to follow.
The programme included one piece that qualified more or less as 'banned'
music, a short elegy entitled Yizkor for viola and string orchestra,
composed by Odon Partos in 1947, reminiscent of Bartok in its harmonic
colouring.
Another short item comprised the 'new' piece, Ben-Zion Orgad's A Vigil in
Jerusalem from 1978, which made up in nocturnal atmosphere what it lacked in
musical substance.
In addition, we had Brigitte Fassbaender as the lead soloist in Die sieben
Todsunden by Kurt Weill, who remains a central figure in the story of what
happened to music in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s despite having emigrated
to the US; and, to finish, Mendelssohn's Fifth Symphony, the 'Reformation'.
As yet, the orchestra's playing lacks finesse and bloom, though the dry
acoustic at the Schloss in Kiel did not help.
For the second concert they moved to the theatre at Itzehoe, two years old
and a more flattering hall for musicians. Bartok's Suite from The Miraculous
Mandarin certainly seemed more vital and Schubert's Ninth Symphony displayed
some rich-toned string playing from time to time, although the orchestra is
still some way behind its compatriots in the Israel Philharmonic, due to
visit Schleswig-Holstein later in the festival.
Noam Sheriff, the Israel Symphony's chief conductor, is primarily a composer
and Tuesday's programme included the premiere of his Piano Concerto. It was
played by Ludmila Berman, a Russian emigre.
With both brevity (it lasts barely 15 minutes) and a cheerful tonal style to
its name, this should not have alienated anybody who came for the Schubert
after the interval.
Various influences hovered in the background, but the finale seemed to
settle on Bach in its two-part invention piano writing and - momentarily -
Beethoven, when the opening bars of his Violin Concerto unexpectedly broke
in just before the end.
The Schleswig-Holstein festival runs until August 21; the Chagall exhibition
at Schloss Gottorf, Schleswig, is on until September 11.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Arts: Witness to a cool Shavian triumph - Saint Joan, George
Bernard Shaw's powerful drama
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With Saint Joan George Bernard Shaw wrote a play that requires a charismatic
heroine, but plugs her in only at certain points. It is not, strictly
speaking, a star vehicle, and if played like one it usually founders; Shaw
had other fish to fry.
At the Strand Theatre, the director Gale Edwards (Australian, female) has
got the balance exactly right. It stirs mind and heart alike, and if you
have intelligent teenage children you should take them along to be stirred
as well. Few modern 'classics' command our thoughtful sympathies like Saint
Joan, and still fewer productions do them such faithful justice.
The play is not really about 'Jeanne la Pucelle', but about the
almost-accidental role she played in a larger, much tougher world of
politics and religion, of which she understood nothing.
In fact Saint Joan represents a disillusioned, retrospective, 1920s view of
History as Realpolitik. The heroine is there to fascinate us, but the heart
of the drama - and it is drama, not just Shavian sparring - lies in the
different ways she is perceived and used by the political masters, both the
French (Burgundian) and the English.
All Joan has to do is to be, while the real action stretches out around and
beyond her. In the small person of Imogen Stubbs, she is a marvel of
bright-eyed energy, from her first bounding entrance. Distinctly elfin, in
fact, with balletic touches, and much more gamine than gamin; one remembered
Joan Plowright's homely, no-nonsense activist (a long way back]) with some
nostalgia.
But Miss Stubbs wields a big, tremulous voice with the best of them, and
regularly catches us between the ribs.
Perhaps she could measure a greater distance between eager optimism at the
start, and weary desolation at the end.
Those Audrey Hepburn eyes do not change much, and there was an awkward
moment when she collapsed to the floor in despair, too obviously confident
of succour by strong arms - which she duly got. As a butterfly broken on a
wheel, nevertheless, she is a radiant creature.
The production has stark sets by Peter J. Davison, basically vertical slabs
that just once open out to give us a fine side-chapel view of the Dauphin's
coronation in Reims Cathedral.
(Reims, by the way, is sometimes Reims and sometimes 'Reems', even in the
mouths of different French personnel.) That is all to the good: picturesque
ramparts are not what the play needs. What it chiefly needs is a solid team
of politicos, both temporal and spiritual; and these Miss Edwards has
supplied in full measure.
Faced with pages of Shavian debate, many a director equips his or her actors
with a rich variety of tics to sugar the pill. Not Miss Edwards; instead,
she makes the debates supply the characters - the variously foxy or
temporising Frenchmen, the blunt or choleric English.
We listen hard. I particularly admired Bruce Purchase's virtuosity with the
Archbishop's speeches, which he rattles off quite lucidly at high speed,
thus saving vital minutes. There is a good Dunois from Philip Quast, and a
properly sullen Cauchon from Paul Webster.
Highest praise, though, for Peter Jeffrey's Inquisitor and Ken Bones' Earl
of Warwick, both of them revelling in pawky subtleties. Jeffrey is a gentle
model of temperate, deadly reasonableness; Bones - with a startling likeness
to Norman Tebbit - plays Warwick with an air of cheerful ruthlessness,
letting his weary, cynical intelligence peep through as the situation
develops. There is just a trace of pain, and distaste, when the execution
has to be got through.
Jasper Britton's artful Dauphin supplies more than comic relief. There is a
twitch or two too many, but his petulance is genuine and sour.
As young Brother Martin, appalled at seeing the trap close, Nicholas Rowe
conveys strength as well as a tender heart. In the epilogue, Gordon Langford
Rowe is splendidly unbuttoned as the plain English Soldier. Among others too
numerous to mention, there is no weak link.
As Warwick's testy chaplain, de Stogumber, David Daker for once makes the
real voice of Bernard Shaw heard. A plain, thick Englishman, he fulminates
and blusters vengefully, but when the chips go down he is overcome with
simple horror.
In his empirical English way, he needs to see what a burning at the stake
means; but having seen it, his revulsion is absolute.
A real vegetarian's argument, that: amid all the thrust and counter-thrust
which Shaw mimics with such relish, this is where the stopper comes, the
final NO. Shaw was not a cynic.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Arts: Plot-boiling 900 Oneonta - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The plays of Tennessee Williams are like bowls of exotic tropical fruit
captured on the turn from bloated ripeness to nascent rottenness.
David Beaird, in this impressive pastiche of the master of Deep South
Gothic, glories in portraying the fruit in galloping decay. He is totally
over the top, leaving audiences suspended in that strange hinterland between
the heart-grip of melodrama and the hysteria of farce.
This is the day that Dandy, the oil-rich tycoon who rules his Louisiana
brood like an oriental despot, knows he is to die.
He has done with hypocrisies and wants his family to finally face up to the
home truths - the usual melange of incest, abortions, drugs and drink and
low sperm counts. As the skeletons tumble out of the capacious closet so do
the yawns of recognition.
But Beaird, who also directs, has an ace up his sleeve.
Dandy is to make a new will, leaving everything to ne'er do well grandson
Tiger, who by whoring, shooting and boozing his way through town at least
shows signs of having enough spunk in him to keep the dynasty going.
If Tiger does not come to his senses enough to accept the fortune, and
responsibility for the business, within an hour then the money goes to the
Church, represented by Father Bourette (Kieron Jecchenis) who has popped in
to supervise the last rites.
This makes for an exciting second half, much stronger than the first in
every way.
At the opening Leland Crooke as Dandy conveys the approach of hell-fire in a
screeching, stressful, performance which wearied me as much as it wearied
him.
After the interval, as the family's future falls on Tiger, so does the
burden of carrying the whole play.
Ben Daniels, all blond mane and bare-chested glory, copes magnificently as
he toys with wimpish brother Gitlo (Jon Cryer, a mess of nervous body
wringing and manic self-justification); bombed-out sister Burning Jewel
(Elli Garnett); and whore Palace (a tough, tart, performance from Sophie
Okonendo).
Having got his plot boiling away like a bowl of jambalaya Beaird has
problems coming to a conclusion.
There are any number of false curtains, and in the end he goes for the Big
One, with Dandy's family assuming a metaphor for the United States, which
has squandered its inheritance in dissipation, and should hand over to a new
generation - a generation with its blood flowing fresh and uncorrupted from
a cultural melting pot.
Some of the acting is hit and miss, perhaps because the format of the play
favours caricatures - the alcoholic wife; the faithful black servant.
But when Beaird lets himself go in a rich, sensual, erotic, often witty,
language, especially in the speeches of Tiger and Dandy, then the play
transcends its hotchpotch origins and becomes a powerful, poetic force.
Tim Shortall has designed a convincingly realistic set, all slats, rich
vegetation and whirring fan, with enough thunder and lightening to suggest
that God is taking a close interest in his potential inheritance.
This is the first work of the West End Producers Alliance, which hopes to
bring a new audience to the theatre by cutting seat prices.
It is an excellent introduction, an out-of-control roller-coaster, but with
enough gripping images to show just how real the unreality of the stage can
be.
The Old Vic.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Arts: Trading places - Off The Wall
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
West End audiences might be small and sluggish in the summer heat but there
is a brisk trade in West End theatres. At last something is to be done with
the derelict Lyceum, acquired by the Apollo Group, best known for its string
of provincial theatres, while next week Stoll-Moss, the leading London
theatre owner, finally gets rid of its rogue elephant, the Royalty, which it
is selling to the London School of Economics for around Pounds 1m.
The Lyceum is obviously the trump card in the poker game being played out
between the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden (due to close for refurbishment
in 1997); ENO at the Coliseum, (due to close for refurbishment, probably in
1998); a National Dance House, which now looks like being based in a
restored building rather than a new structure; the Arts Council; and the
various other guardians of pots of Lottery money.
No deals have yet been concluded. The Royal Opera and the Royal Ballet might
still temporarily decamp 100 yards down the road to the Theatre Royal, Drury
Lane, if Miss Saigon ever closes and the Arts Council finds the money for
the rent.
Both companies might spend the 2 1/2 -year interregnum touring. But if the
Lyceum, with its splendid theatrical history, is restored, at a cost of
Pounds 10m plus, with the potential to take leading opera and dance
companies, it must play a role, if only as somewhere to transfer Miss
Saigon, or its successor.
It all comes down to money, which these days means the Lottery. The Arts
Council's Lottery Fund might look with favour on the Lyceum being gilded
back to life because it could be the perfect eventual home for a National
Dance House, with the dancers moving in, (perhaps with English National
Ballet as resident company) after the opera singers and Covent Garden
dancers have returned to their restored homes. Lord Gowrie, chairman of the
Arts Council, is keen to see the project succeed and he carries weight.
By chance, the Royalty cannot be left out of these speculations. It must
remain a provider of entertainment and the LSE, which will use it for
lectures and conferences during the day, seeks a tenant for the evenings.
There are two contenders for the post, and both want to present dance.
Sadler's Wells is keen to take it on, as is the UK Foundation for Dance, a
new company set up by ex-Sadler's Wells directors.
It sees the 1,000-seat theatre as the perfect venue for middle-scale dance
companies, both British and foreign, and sees a wonderful synergy with a
classically inclined National Dance House based in the nearby 2,000 seat
Lyceum. With so much energy being applied it seems inevitable that London
will get one, if not two, palaces for dance by the millennium.
David Beaird's 900 Oneonta, which opened at the Old Vic this week, is the
kind of play that makes Tennessee Williams look restrained. But however
melodramatic the events on stage as a Southern family gathers to battle over
granddaddy's will, they are nothing to the drama involved in mounting the
production. If it is a hit 900 Oneonta could transform West End theatre.
For this is the first play put on by the West End Producers Alliance, a
group of 17 mainly young, or new, producers who want to make the West End
financially accessible to everybody - from angels to audiences. Seats are
cheap compared to average West End prices.
This attempt to make theatre-going affordable is only possible because the
owner of the Old Vic, David Mirvish, has waived his rent for the first 15
weeks of the run at a personal cost of Pounds 50,000 and everyone else
involved has accepted minimal rewards.
Producer Frank Gero is not mad enough to try and cut Equity fixed salaries
but the American star, Jon Cryer, has accepted Pounds 400 a week instead of
the thousands he might have anticipated from a London run, and David Beaird
is receiving a Pounds 1 advance as against the usual Pounds 5,000 for the
writer. Everyone, from director to stage crew, has gone along with the
cost-cutting, which has enabled 900 Oneonta to arrive at the Old Vic with
up-front production expenses of Pounds 90,000, as against a more typical
Pounds 160,000, and weekly running costs of just Pounds 17,000, two thirds
of the usual bill.
If 60 per cent of the 1,067 seats are sold for each performance the up-front
costs will have been recouped in 11 weeks and then everyone can expect a
modest pay rise. And if 900 Oneonta is a hit then those theatre owners who
are dragging their feet at the idea might see this as the salvation of a
West End theatre currently wilting in the heat. Whatever the outcome the
West End Producers Alliance has its next play primed for September.
Unison, the 1993 merger of the three unions, Nalgo, Cohse, and Nupe, is
using the arts to make itself better known. It is putting Pounds 15,000
behind the British premiere of Dario Fo's latest play Abducting Diana which
opens during the Edinburgh Festival at the Pleasance on August 13.
Nalgo had always been a minor backer of the arts but had to overcome
opposition from the more philistine members of the new union. On the surface
the play is a sexual comedy but it also shows that 'anarchists are the
unwitting tools of the capitalist society' so Unison members can safely
attend.
In the cast is Susan Penhaligon who might see her own first play produced
during the Edinburgh Festival. It could surprise her: she wrote it after
being hypnotised by her psychiatrist husband. Antony Thorncroft

FT  23 JUL 94 / Arts: A popular and a classic treat - Harper and Cook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A tremendous week in London for lovers of singing. At the Proms on Tuesday,
Heather Harper, the greatest British singer since Kathleen Ferrier, returned
from retirement and after serious illness to sing Berg's 'Altendorf Lieder'
with the calm vehemence and commanding phrasing that have been her
hallmarks.
And at Sadler's Wells Barbara Cook, the greatest singer in popular music
today, also returning after illness, made a long-awaited return to Britain.
The differences between the two are obvious. Harper is collected, high-art,
and her 20th-century specialties include Strauss, Britten, Tippett. Cook is
bubbly, populist, and her repertory goes from Kern and Gershwin to Sondheim
and Amanda McBroom. It is as absurd to imagine Cook in Tippett's 'The Ice
Break' as to imagine Harper recording 'The Disney Album'.
Now, however, I hear some resemblances between them. These resemblances are
not fortuitous, for they simply show that both Harper and Cook were trained
along truest classical lines.
In both cases, it is less voice than musicality that makes them so
remarkable; in both cases, the voice has been nourished by bringing together
the pearly upper register with the biting chest notes into one equalised
range.
In both one hears a vocal style that is based, on the one hand, on clean
entry into notes and, on the other, sculptural portamento connections
between notes. And, while both offer the clear and natural diction, they
attend first and foremost to musical phrasing. There is no exaggerated
emphasis on special words. The words seem simply - inevitably, it sounds to
us - to find their inevitable place amid the shape designed for them by the
music.
Like all great artists, Cook is made up of contrasts. She has vulnerability
within power, grandeur within intimacy, brio within calm. She often reaches
phrases of burning intensity, but presents herself with no-nonsense
happiness. She comes from an old and conventional showbiz tradition, but she
takes pains to emphasise the work of women composers (Amanda McBroom) and
women lyricists (Dorothy Fields). She is proud to deliver new or recent
songs, but is equally proud of creating roles in such classic musicals as
Bernstein's Candide and She Loves Me.
Cook is the only popular singer active today who should be taken seriously
by lovers of classical music. She is not a crossover artist - though she
tells of singing Madam Butterfly's entrance music (with the high D flat
option) as an audition piece for Leonard Bernstein - and yet most of today's
opera singers could learn plenty from her. Every phrase is packed with
interest, and every song is shaped from first to last. Has any singer since
Callas matched Cook's sense of musical architecture? I doubt it.
It begins with the simple eloquence with which she phrases a line of
recitative; you hear her plant lines such as 'There goes my young intended.
The thing is ended. Regrets are vain' with such simplicity, but with such
underlying grasp of rhythm that they brand themselves into your mind.
Then, when it comes to the song itself, she shows the point of each note to
the phrase and of each phrase to the whole. The endless variety with which
she combines legato and staccato, or distinguishes between staccato and
marcato, is exceptionally rare.
Anyone who knows her singing will know how thrillingly she can build even
some innocent little songs to powerful climaxes, but I was amazed this time
to hear her, amid a hauntingly plangent account of Irving Berlin's 'Change
Partners and Dance With Me', start rising towards one such climax - only to
pause, and then to taper the song away into the tenderest diminuendo close.
As for 'Losing my Mind', she places its numerous little four-note phrases
into a structure so firm that she might be singing Faure, not Sondheim.
This is a highbrow way to talk about someone whose repertory includes 'Sweet
Georgia Brown' and John Williams's 'Can You Read My Mind?' Cook herself is
very simple.
'They tell me I belong to the golden age of musical comedy,' she remarked on
opening night. 'I wish they'd told me that then - I'd have had more fun.'
And very sunny. She can take old chestnuts such as 'You've Got to Accentuate
the Positive' and make them live again, as if from some core of true faith.
Several of her songs - such as 'Better with a Band' and 'Sing a Song with
Me' - are about singing itself; and others are about dancing. Cook is a
stout woman, and yet she is easy with her own body.
She half-dances through some numbers, and there are moments when her jazz
sense is such that she slaps all her weight, with the beat, on to one foot,
and your kinesthetic sense half-expects her to burst into a tap routine.
But she sings a quiet song like 'Why Did I Choose You?' from complete inner
stillness, only raising her arms slowly as she reaches the conclusion, in a
gesture so powerful that it embraces the theatre.
She sings 'Why Did I Choose You?' - as she always sings her first encore -
without any amplification. You realise all the more clearly then just how
steady her breathing, how expansive her phrasing.
Earlier on, there were times when the 16-piece band sometimes is too loud
for her (though the way she can then cleave through an orchestral tutti with
one of her own is always a major thrill). I think she has lost a little of
her upper register, but am more struck than ever by the way that both chest
and facial resonances are combined in her vocal tone.
At Sadler's Wells until July 31.

CRACK OF DOOM
by Jon Silverman
Headline Pounds 16.99,
256 pages
Newspaper headlines and American films form most people's perceptions of
crack cocaine. Jon Silverman's book reveals what the drug looks like, its
origins, how it is used, its cost and its effect on the user. He also
describes those involved directly with it: the law enforcers, the
increasingly ruthless dealers and the desperate addicts.
His insights dispel any lingering doubts about the evil of crack cocaine and
the threat it poses to our society.
The focus is mainly on Britain and Silverman levels some criticism at our
failure to develop a comprehensive strategy to deal with it. Crack is a
relatively new drug in Britain, so to some extent the criticism is
justified. But it is still difficult to find any government or law
enforcement agency which would claim to have the answers.
Earlier this month, I attended a conference in New York with representatives
from many countries; we shared views, we compared problems, we examined our
policies and solutions. But we are all in the same boat - there is still no
comprehensive answer to the crack problem.
The text outlines that problem and describes specific operations by the
Customs and the police. Some of these accounts are personalised a little too
much, making it appear as if it was a single officer with persistence or
flair who was the sole driving force. While this is partly true, an
individual needs the support of a team and the strength of an organisation
behind him or her to operate effectively.
Silverman does, however, capture well the feelings and emotions of officers
involved in operations - their fears and frustrations, the highs and lows,
their personal sacrifice in the constant pursuit of justice.
As to the traffickers and peddlers of this obnoxious cocktail, crack;
towards the end of his book Silverman mentions the white criminals who see
drug trafficking as less dangerous and more lucrative than robbing banks and
have their own way of importation (probably gleaned from American movies).
He pays most attention, however, to the formation, growth and development of
the Jamaican criminals known as 'Yardies'. The early political support for
these vicious criminals, their spread through the US into Britain, the trail
of senseless violence and the apparent lack of remorse is terrifying.
The accounts of summary executions, gang warfare not seen since the days of
Prohibition, torture - one woman had a hot iron pressed against her face
then was doused with boiling water to make her talk - is horrific.
The haphazard nature of their groupings, their false identities, the
peripatetic nature of their lives - moving on false passports, between here,
the US and other countries - make these criminals difficult to target. The
job of the police is made even harder by the fear of violence among
potential informants, the near impossibility of operating undercover in
these areas and the fear of being dubbed racist for mounting large
operations in black areas.
The advent of personal radios and an army of children willing to act as
lookouts and warning sirens exacerbates the problems, which are ably covered
by Silverman.
For users of the drug, the picture is perhaps bleakest of all. Their lives
are taken over completely by little rocks of crack as they fall, almost
irreversibly, into the fires of utter dependence and show a willingness to
maim, kill or even sell their children to maintain their habit.
The human depravity which lead to the sacking of Rome pales into
insignificance alongside the lives of some crack users. Whether we feel that
they are victims or villains, we cannot or must not ignore them - and as yet
we have no proven cure for their addiction.
In this very readable snapshot of a 20th-century drug, Silverman offers the
reader an honest picture of the effects of such a vicious drug on our
society but does not, and probably cannot, offer solutions.
He hopes that crack will run a cycle - he postulates 10 years and says we
have five to go. I will not hold my breath.
The reader can, however, be assured that all law enforcement agencies
throughout the world now know a great deal more about crack and its wake of
violence and criminality.
Improved intelligence networks, spearheaded in Europe by Europol; better
liaison and sharing of information supported by the recently formed National
Criminal Intelligence Service, and multi-agency targeting operations of the
criminals involved are all part of our 1990s armoury and in this we do
achieve much success.
But if we are to eradicate this drug from our society we must help people,
particularly our young, to recognise crack for the plague that it is and
convince them to avoid it. They need help and they need it now.

HUNGRY GENERATIONS
by John Wain Hutchinson Pounds 15.99,
378 pages
CATALYSTS
by Stanley Middleton
Hutchinson Pounds 15.99,
266 pages
When John Wain died in May, aged 69, he had been working on his trilogy of
novels set in Oxford for the past decade.
Parts one and two, Where The Rivers Meet and Comedies, appeared in 1988 and
1992. Posthumous publication of Hungry Generations completes the work; it is
built around the lives of two brothers, the sons of an Oxford publican. One
is a skilled worker at the Morris factory at Cowley, and the other a history
don at an imaginary college called Episcopus.
Where Rivers Meet is the over-all title. Not only does Oxford stand at the
confluence of the Thames and the Cherwell, it also has two distinct faces,
as a centre of industry and of learning, both of which are contained in the
work.
There is rather more of gown than of town in this final volume. Events are
seen through the mind of the academic brother Peter Leonard. By 1948, when
it starts, he has reached the age of 38, and he remains in Oxford teaching
history until the crunch-year of 1956 with news of the Suez adventure, and
the march of Soviet troops into Hungary, reaching him as the story ends.
It was a conscious gamble by the novelist to stake everything on Oxford. It
has been done to death in detective fiction and often used by serious
novelists such as Compton Mackenzie, Waugh and Murdoch who have looked back
to their time there as an essential element in a larger work - Sinister
Street, Brideshead Revisited, The Book and The Brotherhood. But to find it
treated by a novelist as the summation of a lifetime's experience is unique.
Wain leaves one in no doubt as to his deep affection for the city in spite
of the spoilations of Billy Morris, as the hero's father calls Lord
Nuffield.
His clever son, historian of the 18th century, shares Wain's insatiable
curiosity about everything from the mating habits of the sparrows on the
college lawn, to the construction of the P3 MG racing-car and the sex
theories of Wilhelm Reich.
Their main function seems to be to distract the reader from the hard core of
pain that might otherwise make the book unbearable to read.
Pessimism about human possibility is the dominant mood. There is the long
agony of Leonard's divorce and humiliating return to live like a single man
in college; the pain of trying to reconcile the bitter after-taste of his
first marriage with the domestic bliss of his second (a cloying note); the
pain of the death of his son in a motor-racing accident and the series of
disasters that befall other members of the senior common room.
The hero is Wain's alter ego, the Oxford don that Wain never became.
Teaching and research was a way of life he firmly rejected when he resigned
his lectureship at Reading in 1955 after the success of Hurry On Down. Wain
could then have become a leading journalist critic in London. But he did not
want to be that either. He was made a fellow of the Royal Society of
Literature; after a year he resigned that too.
Instead he went to live near Oxford. It was a quiet, industrious and
inevitably insecure existence, but it enabled him to do his own thing, which
was to write novels and poetry.
With Catalysts Stanley Middleton shows that he belongs to that small number
of novelists able to integrate convincing accounts of musical performance
into the texture of a novel of contemporary life. They include Proust, EM
Forster, Aldous Huxley and JB Priestley.
Here we are with the elderly music teacher at a school in the Midlands.
His son is a cellist of renown whose mistress is an opera star. There are
several fine descriptions of them in action in a novel that shows with great
subtlety the way professional life acts as a catalyst upon private life.
It does this just as much in the unglamorous professions of the other main
characters - accountancy and English teaching.
This quintet weave in and out of each others' lives in a novel that is not
so much written as delicately scored.
Middleton, joint Booker Prize-winner, is a master-technician of the form.
His latest piece of work will give much pleasure to its connoisseurs.

KREMLIN WIVES
by Larissa Vasilieva
Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 20.00,
241 pages
The central interest of this book is the witness it bears to people - men
and women - living lives under conditions we cannot understand or judge
without a large effort of imaginative reconstruction.
It is only moderately well written (though it appears to be well translated)
and it is sloppy like much of Russian writing on current affairs - great
unevenness as the writer's interest waxes and wanes, analytical short
windedness, sentimentality breaking through and minimal sourcing.
But the fascination of the subject - the testimonies contained within it to
the lives of women who were at once monstrous and oppressed, most favoured
and most in peril of their lives, expected to be at once 'both Martha and
Mary, housewife and comrade' - compensates for these defects.
Apart from the last chapters, where recent Kremlin wives are presented as
brief cardboard cutouts, the character sketches are quite readable.
The portraits of the first wives are the best and most poignant. Nadezhda
Krupskaya, who married Lenin on his exile to Siberia in 1898 and who
outlived him by two decades, is drawn as a woman whose enforced modesty of
expectation for herself - genteel-poor and plain - led her to Marxism, then
to Lenin.
Inhibited and puritan, she and her mother were nevertheless friendly to
Lenin's probable mistress, Inessa Armand - her temperamental opposite but
comrade all the same. Lenin's amanuensis in the years of exile, she adapted
with avidity to the role of purger of bourgeois filth from the school
syllabus after the revolution - banning a vast codex of Russian and foreign
authors, including Dostoyevsky, Blok, Akhmtova and Pasternak.
Vasilieva comments, rightly, that 'had (she) wielded supreme power, she
would have inaugurated a cultural inquisition far more effectively than
Stalin because she was better educated than he was. It was not just a matter
of who ultimately led the party machine, but of the machine's ultimate
cruelty.'
At least Krupskaya was in charge of her own life to some extent and - though
famously sworn at by Stalin during her husband's final illness - was
untouchable after his death.
Stalin's own (second) wife, Nadya Alliluyeva, was half his age, gently
reared in Georgia, yet apparently strong willed.
Her suicide remains a mystery: Trotsky, an unreliable witness, believed it
was a murderously prompted suicide, with Nadya killing herself after being
'showered with obscenities' by Stalin at a Kremlin party.
Vasilieva, with no proof, appears to plump for murder, saying that she 'had
to die. Her presence would have prevented Stalin from fulfilling his
historic mission. He would tolerate no obstacles on his path, especially
female.'
Though Stalin, Vasilieva believes, had affairs, he encouraged a reassertion
of outwardly bourgeois morality in sexual behaviour which snuffed out the
bohemianism of the early Bolsheviks.
Armand herself, Alexandra Kollontai and the beautiful and flamboyant Larissa
Reisner were among the leading women proponents of a sexual liberation, that
included the acceptance of a woman's right to initiate sexual advances - a
huge leap for the generally middle class or even noble ladies who were the
leading revolutionaries.
None of those who lived into the 1930s were heroines, though many are said
to have been kind. The iron imperatives of the party and the terror it
inspired entered them as it did their husbands, displacing what our age sees
as the priority of personal satisfaction and individual affections with a
rigid assumption that the party always comes first.
Kollontai did not lift a finger to save a former lover from Stalin, even
when she was ambassador to Sweden: later, Marshall Budyonny, Commissar
Molotov and even Soviet President Kalinin all submitted to their wives being
arrested, imprisoned, tortured, probably raped and sent to camps while the
men - uncomplaining - laboured on in their high posts.
When released, these wives returned to their husbands and in the case of
Paulina Zhemchuzina, wife of Molotov and a victim of the anti-semitic purges
of Stalin's last years, to the party and to devotion to Stalin. When he saw
these men, Stalin would tease them about missing their wives.
Khrushchev, the de-Staliniser, makes the break for the wives too. Nina
Petrovna, his wife, 'reassured terrified Americans as they saw that this
vast empire was now ruled by a funny fat man and his provincial wife,
clutching her handbag to her ample stomach'. Nina Petrovna had had a tough
life in Ukraine before she ascended the increasingly comfortable ladder of
power.
Vasilieva says that her priorities were in the end personal: 'She still
loved the party and fondly recalled past purges(]) - yet she would not
sacrifice her life's companion to its gaping maw'.
While it is too diffuse and fragmentary to be a good book, it does lift the
curtain on lives where idealism, self-preservation, fanaticism, pity,
ruthlessness and stoicism mixed into a state of mind which was to dominate
and cow a country.

PARIS AFTER THE LIBERATION: 1944-1949 by Anthony Beevor and Artemis Cooper
Hamish Hamilton Pounds 20, 531 pages
Artemis Cooper has published an excellent account of Cairo In The War, not
to speak of editing the correspondence of Evelyn Waugh and Diana Cooper (her
grandmother). Anthony Beevor is responsible, among other things, for a
first-class history of the Battle of Crete. They are married. Paris After
The Liberation is a good idea which does not quite come off. That deserves
explanation.
The story - of Paris between the Liberation of August 1944 and the economic
stabilisation in 1949 - is fascinating, and calls out for an accessible,
layman's account on the 50th anniversary (this book does not pretend to be a
work of academic scholarship, a field which is being intensively tilled at
present).
The authors are privileged: they benefit from access to the diaries of the
British ambassador Duff Cooper (grandpa), Nancy Mitford's unpublished
letters, and various other archives of the English Establishment to which, I
assume, they belong.
The value of this access is less clear because it tilts the narrative
towards the beautiful people. It is amusing to have it confirmed that Diana
and Duff called de Gaulle 'Charlie Wormwood' (as in 'wormwood and gall'). We
get an insider's view of Louise de Vilmorin (Duff's lover), of Nathalie
Barney ('l'imperatrice des Lesbiennes'), of Gaston Palewski (Nancy Mitford's
boyfriend), even of Cocteau, of Poulenc, of Christian Berard.
The first hundred pages are in effect a brisk introduction, which is a
dangerous tactic in book-making because it misleadingly suggests a
superficial and over-hasty tone to what, from 1944, becomes detailed,
analytical, better. With the arrival of Duff Cooper's diaries, the book
looks up.
The first theme has to be the end of Occupation and the subsequent epuration
sauvage. Again, this is a subject which has at last been heavily
investigated, and we read of Paris only. Collaboration was a nightmare
subject which brought much head-shaving and arbitrary execution in late 1944
and even more guilt for many years to come.
Arletty and Sacha Guitry, Drieu la Rochelle, Celine, Colette, Chanel, Lifar,
Giono, de Montherlant, even Simenon, Barrault and Clouzot, were among many
artists who came under different degrees of suspicion.
It was, and remained for years, a terrifying topic. Isaiah Berlin here
offers a useful definition of acceptable conduct under the German
Occupation: you could do business with them but 'you did not have to be cosy
with them'.
One problem, of course, was that the French communists had suffered
particularly under Vichy with the execution of hostages and deportation of
slave labour. Now the communists could see a way to exploit their sufferings
in their bid for post-war power.
This is the central political subject of these years, and the second theme
of this book. 'There are only two real forces in France today,' said de
Gaulle in December 1945. 'If the communists win, France will be a Soviet
Republic; if I win, France will stay independent.' It was not to be as
simple and the Beevors (if I may call them that) track the story in fair
detail until it is clear by 1949 that the Fourth Republic has come through.
The weakness of the style of this book is immediately confirmed: 'The mood
of optimism was further reinforced on 18 July (1949), when Odile de
Lenoncourt married the Duc de Guiche, eldest son of Duc de Gramont, at the
Church of Saint-Louis des Invalides. The right people were still marrying
the right people.' And the bride wore Dior.
So that was all right. In between many pages of political and diplomatic
history we have been given the cultural and literary story.
We are assured of the 'arrogant irresponsibility' of the French
intellectuals, their trahison des clercs, the 'dictatorship of the
progressive intelligentsia', the eventual failure of radical ideas to
overcome the French bourgeoisie - big themes - but the reader is not always
convinced.
The problem, I suggest, is that the Beevors have bitten off more than they
can chew.
They have written an interesting but awkward combination of a
politico-diplomatic history of France in the immediate aftermath of war and
the cultural story of those same years. But in the event, they have fallen
between two stools.

AUDREY: HER REAL STORY
Alexander Walker Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 18.99, 319 pages
Audrey Hepburn was one of the most entrancing screen heroines of the postwar
generation. Yet she never appeared a career film star.
She hid the word 'talent', seemingly, inside the word 'dilettante': which
left anagrammatically another key Hepburn word, 'diet'.
She was an airy, pencil-thin beauty who had suffered from bouts of bulimia
and anorexia; and in her later years as a Unicef worker she looked scarcely
less malnourished than the African children with whom she was photographed.
Alexander Walker's biography does this semi-invisible sprite full justice.
He subtitles the book 'Her Real Story': which means that the family
skeletons are wheeled out early from the walk-in cupboard, brushing through
the daughter's Givenchy dresses on the way.
Father was a Nazi propagandist who spent the second world war in a British
jail. Mother was a Mosley supporter who wrote for Oswald's fascist rag
Blackshirt. There is a photograph of mum on the steps of the Nazi Party HQ
in Munich and there are 'well-attested reports' that both parents attended
Nazi rallies.
This is piquant stuff for anyone who had suspected a different upbringing:
that Audrey - to judge from the pedigree manner - had been brought up in a
palace made of porcelain, where the tinkle of tea sets vied with the distant
cry of peacocks.
Yet a problem childhood - father, as well as being a political rotter,
walked out on the family when Audrey was young - may account for the
star-making oddities in her personality.
There was that low, lovely, gulpy delivery, full of mysteriously-sourced
nervous energy. And there was the feeling, in films as varied as War And
Peace, The Nun's Story and Breakfast At Tiffany's, that the lithe and
soaring charm just might be broken, given the right nemesis, on the wheel of
brute ordinariness.
Walker keeps his book moving even when banality does threaten to break into
Audrey's life: which is not often. Chapter headings have the thump of a
Saturday matinee for adults. 'The Girl With Death In Her Shoes' is the title
for the section about Audrey's wartime exploits carrying anti-Nazi leaflets
into occupied Europe. And JFK's death has a surreal tragic eclat - the
actress broke down in her dressing-room - amid the fluffy frivolity of
shooting on My Fair Lady.
Like any good heroine in the mystery drama of Life, Audrey also had a
doppelganger.
Her career and that of Leslie Caron, Walker notes, were bizarre reflections
of each other. Each began as a ballet student; each went on to specialise in
adorable gamine roles; each starred opposite Fred Astaire in consecutive
1950s musicals - Daddy Long Legs (Leslie) and Funny Face (Audrey); each had
a major success, on stage or screen, as Gigi and later as Ondine.
But Audrey was more than just a pretty - or funny - face. When Billy Wilder
picked her for two early roles in Sabrina and Love In The Afternoon, it was
because he saw the native intelligence: 'She looks as if she could spell
'schizophrenia'.' And Richard Avedon pounced on her, during his period as a
Hollywood shutterbug, and immortalised those strange wide eastern features,
like a pixie graduated from a Peking sixth form.
Audrey finally did run into the buffer of brute ordinariness. She met and
married Mel Ferrer. But Walker argues that she probably needed his prosaic,
domineering guidance.
For years he acted as her agent and minder: the only roles he seemed up to
in his own dull but persevering career. In War And Peace Ferrer's Prince
Andrei is the price we pay for Audrey's Natasha. And who can forget, once
read, Michael Powell's comparison of Ferrer's stage performance in Ondine
with that of France's Louis Jouvet. 'When Jouvet paused, the audience
paused. When Mel paused, the whole play stopped dead.'
In later years, thanks to spending more time with Mel and the family,
Audrey's screen acting became occasional. But she delivered a brace of late
delights in Two For The Road and Robin And Marian. And for a woman about to
tread the famine lands of developing countries, she showed a bizarre
persistence, right to the last, in claiming her own glamour rights.
Those Givenchy dresses were a point of principle. She even asked for one to
play the dowdy spinster in Summer And Smoke. (Result: the role went to
Geraldine Page.) But then Hepburn knew her worth. She wanted the right dress
in the same way that she wanted the right truck in her charity safaris:
because they helped do the job.
The job in Hollywood was to be a ministering angel to glamour-starved
audiences in the recovery years after the war. The job in Africa was to be a
ministering angel to more literally starved people in the recovery years
that never end. And perhaps the actress' Unicef devotions were a last, late
bid to make up for those guilt-bequeathing parents.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Gardening: Why not host a hosta in a civilised setting?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whenever something improves, other people complain. Why ever do we listen?
For nearly five years, they turned me off a gardener's godsend; they let me
shelter behind the excuse that my new garden was too dry.
In the 1970s, I grew hostas like an adventurous madman. They revelled in my
beds of pure pig-manure. Then, people started complaining that they were
over-bred and over-priced. Their great suppliers in America seemed to have
lost sight of reality: could you really face up to owning a hosta called
Zounds?
Even if you cannot identify a hosta, you have probably got one. They are
those richly-leaved plants which re-appear in spring in shades of green,
blue and green-yellow and which are about to flower on long stems with mauve
and white tubular buds.
Since the 1960s, the fanciers have moved in and the rest of us have found
that these boldly-leaved plants are almost indestructible. Today, there are
hosta-groups, hosta-freaks and I suspect that people swap them like
horticultural Tupperware.
But slugs remain their greatest admirers. If we can kill off the slugs, we
may one day have a hosta war. The balance of trade is tantalising. In the
wild, the best hostas grow in Japan. Hosta fluctuans is grown beside many
Japanese doorways and its leaves are used in a clever recipe for rice.
There were Japanese breeders of hostas in the 1950s, but the Americans saw
their potential, took parents home and made them a plant for the family
yard. Their market is enormous, but the Japanese are returning to the
children of their heritage. They are continuing to breed new forms and are
planning to bring wild varieties into London.
In Britain, we use them fully, encouraged by all the experts and well served
by our leading nurseries. Hostas belong in the most civilised and
fashionable settings. The big grey-blue leaved sieboldiana Elegans is the
perfect foil for the taller older-fashioned roses where it was often used by
that great garden-planter, the late Lanning Roper.
Hostas now turn up in pots on their own, a favourite feature of no less a
designer than David Hicks. There are now so many that you can host a hosta
in any good garden: seven years in a row, Sandra Bond, of Goldbrook Plants,
Hoxne, Eye, Suffolk, has won gold medals for her stunning exhibits at
Chelsea. She has the biggest list, both home-bred and American. From the
Hosta Society, you can also try the Bowdens at Cleave House, Sticklepath,
Okehampton, Devon.
The ins and outs concern pots, stamina, scent and naming. First, the matter
of pots. Hostas should not be lost in the potted jungle which I otherwise
champion: they look and grow best in a pot to themselves. The problem is
that most of them develop very deep roots over time: they have split a clay
pot with me and will do the same in terracotta.
There are golden rules, endorsed by Sandra Bond. It is best to pot a hosta
in stages, from a small to a greater size over the years: do not start it in
a large urn when it is young. Always pot it in a plastic pot which is
expendable: put this plastic holder inside a clay or terracotta pot, both to
ease the watering and to guard against the power of the roots. Against
slugs, use greasing. The hosta's greatest enemy is not a gardener on
holiday: it is our slimy friend. An experienced reader tells me that she
smears Vaseline on her pots' collars and that it keeps off the invader.
Slugs cannot ooze their way across grease.
Next, scent and stamina. In pots, the best forms are the fortunei group
because they have the most shallow roots. They are also good in gardens. I
have gone off the highly popular Frances Williams, which was the star of the
early 1980s, because its stale yellow edging on the blue leaf turns down in
dry weather and is slow to develop. My new stars are Sum and Substance, the
blue-leaved Blue Angel and Halcyon and the scented Sugar and Cream and
Summer Fragrance.
Of all these forms, Sum and Substance is the most remarkable. It makes a
clump of green-gold leaves for which one plant suffices in isolation. It
grows in sun. It is starting to flower today in its second year and, after a
preliminary defence with slug bait in April, it is left alone by slugs. Its
leaves are too tough, like cheap steak. At Pounds 8 a plant, it is well
worth it, especially as it can soon be divided.
Scented hostas are also on the way up. For years, I battled with the old
Edwardian favourite, plantaginea, which Gertrude Jekyll used so prettily in
her green shaded courtyard which linked the house and garden. Its white
flowers are hugely pretty and do appear with me, but I realise that they
refuse to show in the Midlands and the North. The new Sugar and Cream is
variegated and far stronger, even in colder areas. We can expect great
things from the new Fragrant Bouquet, which costs Pounds 19 and is a top
Bond recommendation: one for a bond-dealer's birthday.
Lastly, the names are a serious problem. At Hampton Court flower show, even
I could see that some of the exhibitors were giving hopeful names to hostas
which the experts would not validate. It is essential to buy from
specialists, as many of their plants will be divisions from a supervised
stock-parent.
The trouble is that hostas are re-emerging and are stunning value for small
urban gardens. Price is slightly less important where you can only house a
few good features and, although a hosta disappears in winter, it has the
quality of a natural sculpture in a slug-free area. Wherever there is money,
there is muck.
It takes several years for a young hosta to develop its full quality and you
should never judge one on its first three seasons. Inevitably, general
traders may fail to realise that their promising young plant is not the true
speciality which experts can identify.
The last five years on the sidelines have taught me how much has changed
among the scattier innovations with names such as See Saw. Already, breeders
have blue-leaved forms with the elusive white edge. They will soon be within
our reach and, meanwhile, everyone is after a better texture. The state of
the art is to breed a hosta too solid for slugs. Let us hope that it is not
too leathery for gardeners who share a slug's view of beauty.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Property: For those who fancy a village of their own - Not
all country estates contain such a bonus. But there are plenty of other
reasons for spending big on rural living
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is rare that a complete estate - including the village - comes up for
sale. The last one was Glympton Park in the Cotswolds, sold to controversial
Australian tycoon Alan Bond in 1988 for a reputed Pounds 11m-Pounds 13m. (It
was sold on 18 months later.) Now, another Cotswold estate is for sale with
1,748 acres and an entire, unspoilt village of 25 houses and cottages.
Between Pounds 8m-Pounds 10m will buy Salperton Park, a late-Georgian
mansion set amid parkland in one of the most beautiful parts of England.
Village apart, the deal includes a farm, 199 acres of woods, and a partridge
and pheasant shoot. The vendor is Victor Watkins, a building entrepreneur,
who bought it in 1981 and has improved house and land greatly. The agent is
Savills.
True estates are large parcels of land, usually over 500 acres (unlike the
houses with a few acres that agents label 'estates' to make them sound more
than they are). Buyers are attracted for various reasons: among them the
house, the shooting or the farming.
Most buyers have not owned an estate before, and where to pitch a bid is an
art. Buying agent William Gething, of Property Vision, first works out the
price of its parts - which may be the same as the lots into which large
properties are often divided - and assesses how many others could be
interested. Then he looks at the drawbacks. Is the house too near a road?
Does the land have gaps where bits were sold off in the past?
Then comes the tricky question: is the whole worth more than the sum of the
parts? For Salperton, which is so clearly a unit, the answer is yes. The
same would apply to another Cotswold estate, Haycroft, near Northleach, for
which Savills is seeking offers over Pounds 2.75m.
This has fewer acres (636) than Salperton but house and land are in a
valley, which helps to integrate the other buildings - a mill house, three
cottages, barns and a stable-yard. Then, too, there is pheasant and duck
shooting.
For Savills, 1994 is proving a bumper year for marketing estates. Also on
the firm's books (for Pounds 3.5m) is Chilham Castle and its 298 acres in
Kent. There is a 17th century brick mansion (with additions) and a garden
said to have been shaped by the noted designer John Tradescant.
Chilham is near the Channel tunnel station at Ashford and there have been
inquiries from abroad. Possible uses are as a hotel or some other type of
leisure development - the castle has been open to the public - or a company
headquarters.
Other residential estates for sale include Westhall (430 acres) in
Aberdeenshire, a tower house with Victorian extension plus a sauna, heated
swimming pool and tennis court, all indoors to defeat the Scottish weather
(from Smiths Gore: offers over Pounds 1m); and Zeals (375 acres) in
Wiltshire, listed Grade I (Egerton, Pounds 2.25m).
Owners usually prefer to sell an estate as a whole in order to maintain what
they have cherished, but this does not always work out. At Tythrop near
Oxford (Savills), the farmland is mostly under offer but the magnificent big
house awaits a buyer. At Stratton Audley near Bicester (Strutt &amp; Parker),
and Brede Place in East Sussex (KFR), the house has gone and the land waits.
Christopher Wilson, of buying agent Wilson &amp; Wilson, stresses that farming
is a profitable business again. Although uncertainties lie ahead - such as
how the European Union will review the money-gulping Common Agricultural
Policy - he says that 'net pre-tax yields of 9 to 10 per cent are feasible
if there are enough economies of scale'. This usually means buying more land
while using the same number of men and machines. His firm will prepare a
business plan, including a three-year cash-flow analysis, for a new owner.
Financial institutions selling farming estates, such as Ariel Farms (part of
the BBC pension trust), will do very well as land prices have risen steeply
over the past 18 months.
In Cambridgeshire, Ariel (through KFR) is offering Woodwalton (1,693 acres)
at Pounds 2.95m (to include two farmhouses, three cottages, farm buildings
and a shoot). In Essex, Ariel has Little Braxted Hall (737 acres), with a
superb partridge shoot - the vendors advise retaining the gamekeeper - and
an irrigation licence for 30m gallons to ensure the best potatoes (also KFR,
offers over Pounds 1.75m).
The best sporting estate on the market is Gunnerside (26,485 acres, mostly
heather) in West Yorkshire, with a rich variety of beats and some of the
most exciting grouse shooting in Britain. Savills seeks substantial offers.
The same agent is asking Pounds 1.35m for Scargill (4,222 acres) with a
smaller grouse moor in Teesdale, Co. Durham, where Murray is joint agent.
Where, though, do the pounds go furthest? Probably Ireland. The splendid
Woodbrook House in Co. Wexford, with a 39ft-long drawing room, a
cantilevered spiral staircase and a park, is on sale for the first time
since the house was built in 1780. Hamilton Osborne King will auction it in
Dublin on August 9, suggesting IPounds 500,000 for house and 238 acres.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Food &amp; Drink: United in mediocrity - Giles MacDonogh visits
Ulster - Eating Out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Northern Ireland is worth it. It has some spectacularly beautiful stretches
of countryside and in some parts, at least, it has all the charm and
warm-heartedness more usually associated with the Republic. Even after a
vicious terrorist campaign aimed at the historic centres of Ulster's county
towns, much of it is unspoiled. 'The Troubles' are still very localised.
With a name like mine, I am naturally disposed to like Ireland; and Ulster
is very much Ireland. On the other hand I am not blind to the drawbacks. One
of these is food. When it comes to food, the dream of unity has already been
accomplished: you may eat badly from Ballydehob in County Cork, to
Ballycastle in County Antrim. Things are, however, getting better on both
sides of the frontier.
Ulster has two famous restaurants. In the holiday town of Portrush there is
Ramore and in Belfast there is Roscoff. I have not eaten at Ramore for more
than five years, so I shall forbear from comment. Roscoff, Ulster's only
Michelin-starred restaurant, I have visited more recently.
Its location came as something of a surprise: it is right in the middle of
Belfast where it is popular with British journalists on Ulster postings. It
is keenly priced and busy; with its vaguely nautical decoration it looks a
bit like a sea-side brasserie. The food is described as Franco-Californian,
but it is rather more of the latter than the former.
Rather Californian was the 'seared beef with celery, Parmesan and truffle
oil' which I enjoyed; less so were the 'sauteed sweetbreads, with fresh
pasta, bacon and roast garlic', which I did not. It was a fussy dish and the
sweetbreads were overcooked and over-salted.
A chestnut and amaretti souffle proved a little dull, but Paul Rankin, the
chef, was away that day, and I am prepared to believe that the cooking would
have been more precise had he been around.
In the province they will tell you that Rankin has done much to encourage
small producers of quality raw materials. One supplier he has patronised is
McCartney's in Moira, County Down. George and Gordon McCartney are
prize-winning sausage makers with a list of 31 specialities running from
lamb with mint to pork with banana.
I am happy to say I have not had the banana sausage, but I have eaten a
delicious pork and leek sausage as well as an excellent beef and Guinness.
The McCartneys refuse to countenance sales from anywhere other than their
shop; which is fine if you live in Belfast, which is only half an hour away
by car. Here in London it seems a pity.
The McCartneys use pork from a couple of local farms and superb Ulster lamb.
At the Portaferry Hotel in Portaferry I had wonderfully flavoured lamb from
the Mourne Mountains, while on the Antrim coast the lambs graze on salt
meadows as fine as any in Normandy. Sadly no initiative is made to market
this meat and in most Ulster restaurants there is an unfortunate tendency to
smother the meat in old-fashioned fruit sauces.
A similar lack of initiative has blighted Ulster cheese. In the Londonderry
Arms, in Carnlough, I was told that the local farmers' wives had abandoned
cheese and butter-making in the interests of 'liberation'. I don't know if
this is true, but if it is, liberation would seem to be a high price to pay.
Ulster used to have three farmhouse cheeses, but these are, as I was told,
'all more or less defunct'. There is a serviceable cheddar from Coleraine
and a horrid Limeswold lookalike called Bally Blue. Bally Blue indeed.
Beer from Ulster's one independent brewer, Hilden, proved impossible to
find, even in the Crown Liquor Saloon. The Crown is one of the best
preserved Victorian pubs in Britain: a remarkable achievement for a building
opposite the Europa Hotel in Belfast.
Belfast gin was almost as hard to find. Again this is a pity. It is a nice
lemony drop, and rather better than a lot of the better-known brands.
On the other hand, there was no shortage of Bushmills' whiskey, County
Antrim's most famous product.
Ulstermen are proud of their breakfast 'fry', but this too is something to
approach with caution. Neither the sample produced at the Culloden Hotel in
Holywood, nor the Galgorm Manor, near Ballymena, proved authentic: the
sausages were in synthetic casings (unlike McCartneys'), there was no black
pudding and the sausages had been grilled] The grilling was justified on
grounds of health - something which seems absurd. There is no such thing as
a healthy fry.
On my return to London I dropped in on Richard Corrigan's new restaurant in
Fulham Road. Here is an Irishman cooking superb meals by sagely adapting the
earthy flavours of his mother country: wonderful ravioli of suckling pig;
delicious faggots culled from every imaginable part of the pig's head;
crubbeens (pigs' trotters) and sensational black pudding. Where are the
Corrigans of Ulster? Or is it true that no man is a prophet in his own land?

FT  23 JUL 94 / Cookery: Pep for puddings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By this stage of summer, the first flush of excitement is over. No longer do
many of us want to serve strawberries, raspberries and redcurrants simply
with sugar and cream. This is the season for summer puddings, some
variations on which are given below.
Most of these recipes include a dash or more of citrus because nothing works
faster than limes or lemons to bring out the best in scarlet fruits. Citrus
will restore vibrant life to tired, woolly, over-ripe berries and currants
and it is equally capable of rounding out the thin flavour of slightly
under-ripe fruit.
Limes are the lemons of the tropics. They exude more than a hint of the
exotic with their scented acidity, which seems almost coconut-creamy. I use
them more and more.
My favourite lemons are sfusati, now sold by Safeway as Amalfi lemons at a
hefty premium price. Very large, grown organically and exceptionally
aromatic, their juice is refreshingly sharp, lacking bitterness. In Amalfi,
the fruit is often peeled, sliced, dressed and served as a salad (just as
oranges are sometimes served en salade with black olives in Morocco).
It also makes fine lemonade, lemon curd, lemon souffle, and other sweet
dishes - all with virtually no need for added sugar.
Amalfi lemons are remarkably handsome, too, and growers prefer to export
them with leaves still gracing their stalks. But Safeway is selling them
stripped of the leaves and wrapped in cling film, which makes them seem
rather charmless to buyers unaware of their special qualities.
SUMMER SOUFFLE SURPRISE
Based on a Constance Spry recipe, this takes very few minutes to prepare and
will serve four in style. Success lies in good organisation.
The oven must be pre-heated thoroughly to 425`F/220`C (gas mark 7) while the
freezer should contain plenty of crushed ice and 1pt of the creamiest
vanilla ice cream. Individual souffle dishes and  1/2 lb or so of ripe
raspberries should be chilled in the refrigerator; the souffle ingredients
should be measured out on the work-top and left ready.
Beat two egg yolks with the finely-grated zest of a lemon and a generous
tablespoon of lemon juice. Sit the souffle dishes firmly on crushed ice in a
roasting pan. Spoon the ice cream into them and scatter the raspberries on
top.
Whisk the whites of the two eggs to snowy peaks, incorporating one
dessertspoon of sugar gradually. Fold the yolk and lemon mixture into the
egg whites and spoon the amalgam over the fruit.
Slide the pan into the oven and bake for six minutes until the souffle
mixture is softly set and golden, the fruit is no longer chilly and the ice
cream is just beginning to soften.
LIME TART WITH STRAWBERRIES
Here is a delicious and pretty dessert for six (or eight if appetites are
modest). Wild strawberries are sold by smart greengrocers and can sometimes
be found in supermarkets. Alternatively use  1/4 lb- 1/2 lb ordinary
strawberries, sliced. How much juice a lime will yield varies greatly: play
safe and buy four.
Make some pate sucre with 6oz plain, white household flour, 3oz butter, 3
egg yolks and 2 1/2 oz sugar. Wrap it and chill for at least 30 minutes
before using it to line a 20cm (8in) cake tin with spring-clip sides. Chill
again for an hour or longer.
Meanwhile, prepare and chill the filling. First, beat 5 eggs. Reserve a
spoonful or two to seal and glaze the pastry. Add 6oz sugar to the rest and
beat until soft and foamy. Then beat in the finely-grated zest of 3 limes
and just over 4 fl oz of lime juice. Stir  1/4 pt double cream until smooth
and blend it into the lime mixture.
Line the pastry case with grease-proof paper and beans, and blind-bake it on
a hot baking sheet for 15 minutes at 400`F/200`C (gas mark 6). Remove the
beans and paper, brush the pastry with the reserved beaten egg, and bake for
5-8 minutes more until the pastry is set firmly.
Ladle the filling into the pastry case. Reduce oven heat to 300`F/150`C (gas
mark 3) and bake for 70 minutes.
Let the tart cool completely in the tin: this will take about four hours.
Then, cut the pastry level with the filling and un-mould the tart. Serve it
on the day of baking, covering the lime custard with strawberries, whole or
sliced, just before serving.
WILTSHIRE JUNKET WITH RASPBERRY PUREE
Junket is one of those old-fashioned foods you tend to forget about then
re-discover with glee, for rich versions are every bit as good as coeur a la
creme - and less fiddle to make. When cream is used, the texture of junket
is delicate and rich, slipping down the throat silkily. If the mixture is
meanly milky, the results may be perilously thin and bursting with whey.
Look out for Burgess rennet essence in good grocers (my local Waitrose
stocks it). Today's brew seems to produce a firmer set than it used to and,
sensibly, bottles now are marked with the expiry date of the rennet's
potency.
For four people, mix  1/2 pt single cream with  1/2 pt creamy (gold top)
milk. Warm gently to blood temperature (98`F) with 2 teaspoons vanilla or
caster sugar. Away from the heat, quickly add 1 teaspoon rennet. Stir to mix
well and divide between four small glasses or bowls. Leave undisturbed at
room temperature for about three hours.
Serve topped with raspberries for garnish, and a jug of raspberry puree (
1/2 lb of raspberries sieved and sweetened with 1oz icing sugar, or to
taste). Blackberries, loganberries or mulberries can replace the
raspberries.
LEMON CURD ICE CREAM
I am quoting this from Leith's Cookery Bible (Ebury, Pounds 20). It is good
served with crumbled amaretti biscuits and a handful of fresh berries
(strawberries, raspberries or blackberries) with a matching berry puree to
sauce it. I have also used it half and half with rich vanilla ice cream when
making summer souffle surprise.
To serve six people, put into a small saucepan 4 egg yolks; the
finely-grated zest and juice of 2 lemons; 4 1/2 oz caster sugar; and 4oz
unsalted butter at room temperature and cut into dice. Place over gentle
heat and stir until the butter has melted and the curd coats the back of the
spoon.
Allow the curd to cool, then stir 1pt natural yoghurt into it. Cover closely
and freeze.
Put the ice cream in the refrigerator about an hour before serving.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Food &amp; Drink: A customer-friendly bottle - A new trend in
restaurant wine pricing that saves diners' money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The adage in the restaurant business used to be that 'you never see a good
restaurant advertise'. This is no longer true. A number of leading British
chefs and restaurateurs have taken part in the recent multi-million pound
American Express campaign.
And in New York, Alan Stillman has managed to keep his restaurants - The
Post House, Smith &amp; Wollensky, Cite and The Manhattan Ocean Club - humming
by the use of full-page advertisements in the New York Times.
Although such advertising is invariably too expensive for the single
restaurant, there is no doubt that the industry is aware that it must
promote itself continually to compete for its customers' disposable incomes.
Chefs know that writing recipes in a newspaper, giving interviews on how
they prepare Sunday lunch, even appearing as a judge on BBC's Masterchef,
can keep their bookings' line busy. In today's competitive world no
opportunity can be overlooked.
And now it appears restaurants are beginning to put their wine lists to work
in a way which can bring financial savings to their customers.
The process started in New York at the beginning of the year but has now
surfaced in the smart Fifth Floor restaurant of Harvey Nichols, the
department store, in Knightsbridge, west London. There, on Monday nights,
you can buy your wine in their wine shop and take it to your table at no
extra cost.
The restaurant's mark-up is completely foregone in a brave - and so far
seemingly successful - attempt to boost business on what is invariably the
quietest night of the week.
Dining there recently, we began with a half of Pernard-Vergelesses 1988 from
Rollin Pere (Pounds 9.95 in the shop, Pounds 13.50 on the restaurant wine
list) and then moved on to a bottle of 1985 Barbaresco from Mascarello
(Pounds 18.50 from the shop, Pounds 38.50 on the restaurant wine list) which
the sommelier decanted most professionally.
Both choices showed how consumer friendly this pricing policy can be. The
first wine was slightly disappointing but not excessively so, given the
price we were paying. The second was so glorious that we felt we were
enjoying a most wonderful bargain.
This scheme has been instigated by the restaurant's manager, Edward Hyde,
originally to promote the wine shop.
'Obviously when we began the scheme,' he says, 'we were concerned about its
impact on profitability. Margins have been affected but there have been two
major compensatory factors.
'The first is that we have significantly boosted business on Monday evenings
and, secondly, those who are coming on a Monday night are entering into the
spirit of things. No one is coming in here to drink a bottle of the house
red at Pounds 4.50.
'Instead, our customers are taking the opportunity to trade up and enjoy
wines that they could not afford previously. We have also learnt an
important lesson: that our customers come in here with a very fixed idea of
what they are going to spend on wine.
'If it is Pounds 20 they are still spending that much on Monday nights but
they are drinking far more interesting wines.'
It is a distinct advantage having your own wine shop next to the restaurant
so that at least you can make a retailer's margin. But, taking it a step
further, certain American restaurateurs have shown just how aggressive wine
pricing can stimulate business.
Alan Stillman started the ball rolling at his Cite restaurant in January.
Business at lunch and pre-theatre was good but dinner trade needed a boost
so he adopted a policy of offering unlimited glasses of wines, such as Moet
&amp; Chandon non-vintage champagne, top California chardonnay and
classed-growth clarets, to anyone ordering a Dollars 39.50 (Pounds 25.90)
prix-fixe menu or three-course dinner.
It cost Stillman roughly between Dollars 10 and Dollars 13 per customer,
many of whom in turn spent an extra Dollars 8 on dessert and coffee that
they would not normally have ordered. But it immediately filled the
restaurant through the quietest months of the year and got everyone talking.
It also stimulated fellow restaurateur Philip Scotti at the Century Cafe in
Times Square, into creating a pricing policy on his wines - for bookings
between 8pm and 11pm - that means charges are a mere Dollars 1 per bottle
over cost.
Russell Ruscigno, at his Clinton Street restaurant in Los Angeles, and Gayle
Dierkhising, at the All Season's Cafe, Calistoga, have adopted similar
pricing policies with the same beneficial result. Ruscigno charges a fixed
Dollars 8 per bottle over wholesale, and Dierkhising Dollars 7.50 per bottle
over retail. Both report increased volume and better takings.
Such attractive wine pricing will, I hope, become more common in the UK,
particularly as we have a national network of enterprising off-licences to
provide the wines. In the interim, anyone looking for vinous excitement on a
Monday night and with anything to spare from around Pounds 10 for a 1992
Shaw &amp; Smith Reserve Chardonnay from Australia, to Pounds 175 for a 1982
Domaine de la Romanee-Conti La Tache, should head off to Harvey Nichols on a
Monday night.
The Fifth Floor, Harvey Nichols, Knightsbridge, London SW1. Tel: 071-235
5250. Set three-course menu Pounds 21.50, excluding service and wine.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Fashion: A close-up shot of the catwalk couture - Avril
Groom examines the detail of the top designers' creations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Works of art have rarely attracted as much hype as the clothes in some of
this week's haute couture shows in Paris.
The celebrities with their entourages (Prince and Sylvester Stallone at
Versace, Joan Collins at Chanel and Valentino, Shakira Caine everywhere),
the gangs of heavies, the strange cult of supermodels who become global
personalities purely on the strength of their visual image - all this
creates an ambience more appropriate to the world of showbusiness than to
fashion.
It goes with the well-worn jibes about the unnecessary profligacy of couture
 -how it is expensive beyond the dreams of avarice, how it is worn by a mere
handful of women and how it only exists for publicity value.
This view does the clothes themselves no favours and neither does seeing
them on a remote catwalk. Only by examining them, getting as close to them
as the women who buy them, and by imbibing the atmosphere of a designer's
studio in the hectic weeks before a show does the logic behind this
apparently outrageous industry start to make sense.
I would have to quarrel with Coco Chanel's assertion that haute couture is
'a technique, a job, a commercial undertaking'.
The clothes themselves may be merely examples of high craft but the effort
of creation and co-ordination which a designer makes must give him a claim
to artistry equal to that of a conductor or composer.
Dior or Givenchy have the purest outline of a suit or shoulderline, Balmain
and Ungaro manage the most delicate conjunction of lace and chiffon, while
Versace, Lacroix and Chanel have the cut of the moment, one that makes the
most of female curves.
The couturier's art lies in flattering and glamorising the female body -
even those not shaped like supermodels - with clothes that are unique to
that woman. Along the way they keep alive artisan techniques that might
otherwise die out.
The Comite Colbert, which promotes the luxury goods industry, is so worried
about the possible demise of these skills that it has taken to running
courses introducing teenagers to manual crafts.
Even Chanel, despite its reputation under Karl Lagerfeld's designership, has
problems attracting young apprentices.
'It's a matter of attitude,' says Catherine Riviere, director of haute
couture. 'Karl expects everyone to feel the same commitment and love for
couture that he does. If they are happy to work for 200 hours on one blouse,
if they can go to a fitting and be proud of how their work looks, not
envious of the rich woman who is wearing it, then they are right for us.'
Cutting and sewing couture is, according to a future chef d'atelier at one
of Yves St Laurent's two tailoring workshops, 'a continual learning process.
You can never say your training is over. Similarly a garment is never
finished. You can always improve the detail.'
St Laurent's workrooms thrive on the quality of their handwork. Details such
as a hand-sewn, contrasting silk lining and the way a ruffle is set between
that lining and the outer fabric, or a simple-looking trim that is in fact a
complex confection of appliqued velvet and decorative stitching - these are
the private fruits of the contract between client and couture house.
And such details explain why St Laurent still has the biggest regular
clientele, said to number around 400, in spite of rumours that the designer
himself is now less creatively involved.
Here, shapes are traditional, though this season's experiments with both
very short skirts and the new knee-length bell shape, teamed with small
fitted jackets curvily seamed to the figure, and richly-brocaded Chinese
styles for evening, are an unqualified success, a collection that recalls
his glory days.
The St Laurent client still prefers contemporary quality to trend statements
but this new modernity may prove prophetic, as may Chanel's recruitment
difficulties because, by all accounts, couture is undergoing a small boom.
Dior reports sales up by 14 per cent last year while Lacroix and Versace
both claim a new clientele of young Europeans who want simpler but glamorous
'occasion' clothes which will work in their wardrobes for years and who
appreciate the handwork involved.
Christian Lacroix is the designer par excellence for decorative flourishes
and historical references yet his simpler draped chiffon Directoire dresses
have been his greatest success.
He is also very aware of couture's role as an ideas powerhouse, particularly
in the field of fabrics and technique. His new collection fuses
specially-invented ways of working fabric with revived design ideas such as
the puffed Edwardian shoulder, the hourglass corset and a knee-length A-line
skirt with fluid movement.
As the collection's orchestrator he persuades craftsmen to invent techniques
that give the effects he wants.
'He has a very clear idea in mind which he communicates to experts who then
try and deliver it,' says his assistant Laure du Pavillon.
'The whole show collection is produced in two months and the atmosphere in
the studio, as various elements come together, is fantastic.'
An example this season is the use of large, coloured paillettes which
Lacroix wanted to look fluid rather than 1960s-stiff. This meant sewing them
into an experimental underlying network of stretch silk handknit.
Opposing Chanel, he views such craftsmanship as 'not unlike an art' and so
complex and painstaking are his designs that his atelier of 40 workers can
make for clients no more than 120 pieces (and one outfit may contain 3
pieces) per season.
This is patently not an economic undertaking but is regarded as essential
for the house's creative develop-ment.
Versace is another noted fabric innovator. Like other couturiers, his
traditional decoration is done by the great Paris embroidery houses such as
Lesage, but he also works closely with German and French companies
specialising in metallic fabrics.
They have developed a fluid 'chainmail' at his behest, while other
handworked finishes - such as a fishscale-effect bodice, which on close
inspection turns out to be made of fine silver rings threaded on to
hand-turned ribbon - are made in his Milan workshops.
Even in couture Versace has an eye to commerce. He is a supremely flattering
and glamorising cutter and the impact made by actress Elizabeth Hurley
attending a London film premiere in one of his dresses apparently held
together only by safety pins has sparked many imitators.
Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel has sometimes completely subsumed couture tradition
and technique in headline-grabbing razmatazz, but not this time. Complex
technique is paramount though not always easily visible.
On the catwalk, precision-cut jackets, cinched and fluted like an hourglass,
look effortless. But in fact they contain up to 30 pieces and are shaped by
a profusion of curved, raised seams, each stitched to within a millimetre's
accuracy.
In ready-to-wear, the famous braid trim is sewn on; in couture, this season,
it is an edging of satin and an applique of velvet, or a mix of hand-plaited
fabrics, or tweed made into a fine bias rouleau and applied by hand.
The basic silhouette is a refined version of the tight-waisted, full-hipped
shape reviled when Vivienne West-wood showed it in March. In Chanel's mix of
subfusc shades with the occasional bright or pastel tweed it looks at once
nostalgic and sophisticated. Its craft is beyond reproach yet any general
fashion influence it has will be on overall shape.
In spite of the supremacy of couture technique, it is the bright, immediate
media image to which even the most cynical of us is susceptible.
Looking for a pair of shoes to replace ones ruined in the tropical downpours
which have plagued Paris this week, I found myself tempted by a pair with a
well-known designer label.
Were they really more attractive and wittier than any others, or did I just
imagine that that safety-pin trim would make some of the magic of Elizabeth
Hurley's dress rub off on me?

FT  23 JUL 94 / How to Spend It: Shopping marches on - Two new victims of
shopaholics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One in six of us is a shopaholic, Mintel reports, and although this seems a
depressing statistic, I prefer to look at it the other way and think that
five out of six of us are not. That species - so highly developed in America
 -which needs to shop in order to feel it exists, is still a rarity in the
UK.
But there is disturbing evidence that it is increasingly difficult to find a
shopping-free zone, no matter where you go. Wimbledon, the Royal Opera
House, Hampton Court Palace, Buckingham Palace . . . you name it, they will
be trying to sell you more than spectator sports or a cultural experience.
They will be there with their souvenirs, special offers, postcards and
scarves.
This summer two more bastions have fallen prey to the notion that no
experience is complete unless there is the opportunity to shop: Goodwood,
that most demure of race-courses; and Glyndebourne, that most magical of
opera houses.
In Sussex, Glorious Goodwood is about to begin. It runs from Tuesday to
Saturday and, aficionados will know, it has always had a completely
different atmosphere from Ascot. There are fewer of the international or
Euro-chic set around, dress-codes are informal, even for the Richmond
enclosure, and picnics are part of the treat. This is not the place for
blindingly smart jackets and short skirts. Go instead for soft jackets and
flowing skirts - think country prettiness instead of metropolitan chic.
As for the chaps - where Ascot is morning dress and top hats, Goodwood is
full of racegoers in blazers and chinos or linen suits and panama hats.
Friday sees a grand ball in conjunction with Tiffany, the jeweller, and, to
coincide with Goodwood Week, the company has launched a first collection of
Goodwood-related products.
The collection is small and based on the colour yellow - a particularly
brilliant shade found in a Stubbs painting. You can choose from socks,
head-scarves, silk ties, braces, umbrellas and panama hats. You could spend
50p on a pencil, Pounds 30 on a Panama hat or Pounds 65 on a silk scarf.
During Goodwood Week there will be a shop near the paddock. Afterwards,
everything will be available by mail order (brochures and details from
Goodwood House, Chichester, West Sussex, P018 0PX. Tel: 0243-774107).
Those who have already been to Glyndebourne may have noticed that the new
shop sells a host of items that could come to the rescue of forgetful
punters - you could buy chocolates or champagne (Pounds 25),
waterproof-backed picnic rugs (Pounds 55) and ultra-lightweight folding
seats (Pounds 36.75), insulated bottle bags and champagne stoppers, canvas
bags and umbrellas, all in Glyndebourne green.
Also on sale are photograph albums, address books, noteblocks and pencils.
For opera buffs there are recordings, videos, opera journals and the like.
Prices range from 95p for the notebooks to Pounds 11.95 for a visitors'
book.
The shop is open from 3pm until the end of each performance. A catalogue is
being produced for the autumn. Details on 0273-812321.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Travel: The sound of legend - Adrian Gardiner is impressed
by the natural wonders of the Western Isles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN GARDINER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Untamed for 3,000 miles, the Atlantic ocean crashes in through the mouth of
Uiamh Binn, the musical cave. Foaming cascades surge over black prismatic
columns of basalt. We cling to the rocks under 10,000 gleaming black
polygons of the cavern roof. No one speaks. We frail humans are mesmerised
by the awful power of raw nature, and gaze down at the relentless ebb and
flow, silent witnesses to the geophysical copulation of sea and rock.
In 1772 Sir Joseph Banks, the naturalist who sailed with Captain Cook, was
on his way to Iceland. Storms forced him to seek shelter off the west coast
of Scotland; once the weather had cleared, locals urged him to visit the
musical cave. Thus was the tiny isle of Staffa put on the map.
Subsequent illustrious visitors were equally impressed. 'It surpasses the
finest cathedral,' wrote John Keats of Fingal's Cave, a 220-ft long cavern
named after Finn McCoul, the legend also credited with the construction of
the Giant's Causeway in Ireland.
Felix Mendelssohn, although suffering from toothache and seasickness, was
enchanted: 'Like the interior of a gigantic organ for the winds and
tumultuous waves to play on.' On the spot he scribbled 20 bars of music
which became the theme of his Hebridean Overture.
Six miles south, past the Treshnish Isles and the famous silhouette of the
Dutchman's Cap, lies Iona. Columba and his 12 disciples arrived at the
'Cradle of Christianity' from Ireland in 563 AD and built a monastery.
Vikings vandalised it over the next 400 years. In 1230 Benedictine monks
built a new one, which was torched during the Reformation. The present abbey
is mainly 16th century, with later additions.
The oldest building on Iona is St Oran's Chapel. Columba received a message
from heaven telling him a human sacrifice must be buried under the new
chapel. His disciple Oran volunteered. Three days later (the story goes)
Columba opened the grave for a last look at his friend. Oran was in fine
form.
'There is no wonder in death,' he told Columba, 'and hell is not as it is
reported.' Stunned by such sacrilege, Columba reburied Oran with the prayer:
'Earth, earth, fill the mouth of Oran that he may gossip no more.'
Nearby, the chapel cemetery contains the graves of 48 Scottish kings, and
several Irish and Norwegian ones. King Duncan lies here, murdered by Macbeth
in 1040. Close by the abbey are Celtic high crosses richly decorated with
carvings.
Not even the most hardened atheist could be unimpressed by Iona. Summer
tourists make little impact on the serene atmosphere. Quartzite rock
sparkles in the sunlight, which turns the sea azure. Columba chose his site
well.
Staffa and Iona lie off the Ross of Mull, the south-west corner of the Isle
of Mull. 'Oh Sir,' said Doctor Johnson, 'it is a most dolorous country.' No
doubt it was in those days. The Highland clearances were in full swing:
brutal acts of revenge prompted by the Hanoverian Georges against those
Highlanders who had supported the Jacobite cause.
Dolorous no; but Mull is frequently wet. Tobermory is the busy capital.
Built 200 years ago, it never quite lived up to its founders' expectations
as a major fishing port, but is a favourite yacht anchorage.
Bounty hunters frequent the depths of Tobermory bay. In 1588 Donald Glas
MacLean, a hostage aboard the galleon San Juan de Sicilia, set fire to the
ship's magazine and went to the bottom with her.
West of Tobermory are the white sands of Calgary, a hamlet after which
emigrants named the Canadian city. At Dervaig, Mull Little Theatre, with 37
seats, is said to be the smallest in the world. The stage has room for just
three actors; if the production requires more they have to be played as
puppets.
In the Mishnish, Quinish and Mornish areas of north Mull it is worth
climbing to a viewpoint: Cruach Sleibhe, for example, an undemanding 600ft.
On a clear day you can see to the west the islands of Coll and Tiree in the
Atlantic; to the north, beyond Ardnamurchan Point, most westerly on the
British mainland, the 'Small Isles': Rhum, Eigg, Canna and Muck.
South of Calgary the island of Ulva borders Loch na Keal, the 'dark Loch
Gyle' of Thomas Campbell's ballad, Lord Ullin's Daughter. The loch is the
haunt of seals and harmless basking sharks.
In the Western Isles things change slowly if at all - part of their
attraction for cosmopolitan visitors - but last year a visitor centre and
Clan Museum opened on Ulva. The tiny island boasts two minor celebrities:
the father of explorer David Livingstone, and Major-General MacQuarrie, the
founder of New South Wales. The Ulva ferry, a two-minute trip, must be the
shortest in Britain.
There are two venerable castles in the south-east of Mull. Duart Castle
greets travellers on the Oban ferry, and has been guarding the entrance to
the Sound of Mull for seven centuries. Torosay Castle has a famous Italian
statue walk in its formal gardens and is linked to Craignure, the ferry
terminal, by a narrow-gauge steam and diesel railway.
Oban, three hours north of Glasgow by rail, four by road, is the gateway to
Mull, Iona and Staffa; to Colonsay, Coll and Tiree. The town is a tourist
centre in its own right and in July and August the population expands
five-fold to 35,000, turning it into a lively resort.
In Oban we meet another reference to Fingal. On the east side of Oban Bay is
the Clach a'Choin, or Dog Stone, to which Fingal tethered his mastiff Bran.
But Oban's most famous landmark is McCaig's Folly, an incomplete Colosseum
lookalike. It was intended to be a lavish art gallery and museum but local
banker John Stuart McCaig went bankrupt. As Robert Burns wrote: 'The
best-laid schemes o' mice an' men Gang aft a-gley.'
For accommodation, contact the West Highlands and Islands Tourist Board,
Albany Street, Oban PA34 4AR. Tel: 0631-63122. Ferry timetables from the
head office of Caledonian MacBrayne, Ferry Terminal, Gourock PA19 1QP.
Bookings: contact the Oban office. Tel: 0631-66688.
A ferry (cars prohibited) runs from Fionnphort on Mull to Iona. To visit the
Small Isles (round trip nine hours) depart from Mallaig near Fort William.
Islay and Jura are best reached from Kennacraig, near Tarbert, halfway down
the Mull of Kintyre. To Islay takes two hours, to Jura another five minutes.
Calmac offers bargain tickets for those making several journeys.
From Oban, Calmac runs a Three Isles Tour, May to September - an all-day
trip by coach, ferries and motor launch, visiting Staffa, Mull and Iona,
weather permitting. The cost is Pounds 21 adult, Pounds 11 child: very good
value.
The most luxurious way to see the Western Isles is aboard the converted
ferry Hebridean Princess. Departures are from Oban and Kyle of Lochalsh,
with prices starting at around Pounds 500 for a three-day cruise, inclusive
of meals and excursions to castles, distilleries, etc. Contact Hebridean
Island Cruises, Bank Newton, Skipton, North Yorkshire BD23 3NT. Tel:

FT  23 JUL 94 / Travel: First stop, Santiago. Destination, heaven - Nicholas
Woodsworth embraces the icon of St James of Compostela after following a
trail worn by the faithful for centuries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
East from the gates and church towers of Carrion de los Condes, the N-120
runs arrow-straight over the red-soiled, table-top-flat plain of Spanish
Castile. It is a quiet road these days; often there is not a car, a house, a
person or any sign of life to be seen, even to the treeless horizon. It is a
road built for speeding.
Without my noticing it, my speedometer crept well over the limit. And still
I felt I was crawling. Where was Santiago? I was feeling impatient, tired
and, in spite of my destination, profane. I had been driving for two days
from Arles in southern France, and was still 350km short of my goal. I had
wanted to arrive before dark.
As a result, they went by in a flash. I hardly noticed them until they were
in my rear-view mirror - two middle-aged men in walking boots, trudging
along the roadside with packs on their backs and staffs in their hands. In
seconds they were faint dots of colour picked out by the evening sun; then
they were nothing.
But they stayed in my mind. Like me, these men were on their way to Santiago
de Compostela.
Unlike me, they were pilgrims, and they were walking. For them this was not
just the N-120. This was the old route of the Camino de Santiago, the way of
Saint James - for millions in the Middle Ages the most important and
challenging pilgrim trail in Europe.
It is still trudged by the faithful today. Had I walked from Arles - one of
the four main points of pilgrim departure since the 12th century  - the trip
would have taken me eight weeks.
How far had those two middle-aged men come? Where would they spend the
night? I did not know. But suddenly haste seemed less important. I slowed
down and, many hours later than I expected, drove into the holy city at a
contemplative doddle.
I headed where pilgrims have headed for more than 500 years - the Hostal de
Los Reyes Catolicos. It is, say some, the oldest hotel in the world, having
been built as a pilgrim hostel by the Roman Catholic monarchs Ferdinand and
Isabella in that momentous year, 1492.
However, I doubt if it was as comfortable then as it is now. It has kept all
its renaissance elegance, a rich facade, and four dignified interior
cloisters with fountains, gargoyles, stone pillars and arches. There is
still a Gothic chapel and, overlooking it, a Sala de Agonizadas - a room
where the sick and dying attended masses from their beds.
Today, Los Reyes Catolicos is a parador. The pilgrims' cells have been
converted into rooms and suites and the chapel given over to art exhibitions
and musical concerts. The Sala de Agonizadas, due to its perfect acoustics,
became for many years the favourite recital room for classical guitarist
Andre Segovia.
I slept in the hotel like a coddled king. The place still serves a
charitable purpose, though: anyone presenting a compostela - a sort of
pilgrim's passport showing stamped church authentication of the pilgrim
route followed - is entitled to dine here free of charge.
Had I been a pilgrim, I think, I would have been just as happy to get in
from the wet weather as I would to eat. The rain in Spain is not on the
plain at all, but in the Galician hills surrounding Santiago. So wet is this
north-west Atlantic coast that the city's brief but repetitive showers have
gained the title of the 'urinal of Spain'.
So, first things first: off I rushed in the pelting rain and met Luis
Sanchez Rivas, who owns a small, old-fashioned shop, a paragueria devoted
exclusively to the sale of umbrellas. A precise, elderly man, he is in the
same business as his father and grandfather before him.
'Sixty years ago it rained here a lot more,' he said as we reviewed a long
row of solemn black umbrellas standing furled in glass-fronted cases. 'It
hardly rains here at all now.'
I looked doubtfully from the window into a street streaming with water. We
were practically shouting at each other to be heard over the rain. Finally,
I made the choice of a nifty collapsible number and stopped Senor Sanchez
from wrapping it.
'In any case,' he said, handing the umbrella over, 'we like our rain here.
You'll find it suits the city and its mood better than any other weather.
There is nothing finer than walking through Santiago in a good Galician
shower.'
He was absolutely right. Santiago, for all its medieval magnificence - the
entire old city has been declared a national monument - is a solemn and
austere place of silvery rain, shifting, moody clouds and glistening grey
stone.
Despite the crowds of students and the gaggles of tourists, there is
something grave and solemn about the great granite blocks from which the
whole city is built; about the slow, heavy, dull ringing of the cathedral
bells; about the seminaries, monasteries, archbishop's palaces, convents,
chapels, cloisters and crypts that sit solidly and imperturbably at every
turn in the street.
This is a monochrome city, unaccepting of colour or the vanity of
individualism. It is single-minded in construction and uniform in purpose -
the submission of human achievement before a greater glory.
I strolled the city for hours, wandering under stone arcades, stumbling
across hidden plazas, admiring the clean Romanesque lines of its buildings.
I marvelled to think of this sophisticated place built so long ago in a
rainy and wild region so remote from the rest of Europe. What made Santiago
such a magnet that in the 12th century, at a time when people rarely
ventured far from home, the city was attracting over 500,000 pilgrims a
year? Only faith could have done it.
The legend of Saint James's burial in Spain seems to have very little basis,
but that hardly seems to matter. What does matter is that for centuries
millions have believed that a pilgrimage here virtually assured their
passage to heaven.
Due to the great power of Saint James, simply arriving here - not to mention
the indulgences and remissions that could be picked up along the way -
guaranteed a halving of time spent in purgatory. This was worth the
considerable risks and hardships of the journey.
And what about these days?
'It is as tough a walk now as it was eight centuries ago,' Canon Jaime
Garcia Rodriguez told me when I dropped into the pilgrims' welcome centre.
In 23 years of work in Santiago, the canon has met tens of thousands of
pilgrims, some walking from as far away as Poland. Last year, a special year
because the saint's day fell on a Sunday, more than 99,000 pilgrims received
compostelas.
And where does the pilgrim trail lead? I attended a pilgrims' mass at
Santiago cathedral, and began to understand some of the reverence that has
made James the patron saint of Spain, and has made Santiago, along with Rome
and Jerusalem, one of the three holy cities of Christendom.
Santiago's cathedral is huge, ornate, complex and riotously embellished.
Inside, behind a facade decorated with some of the finest Romanesque
sculpture in the world, is an altar even more lavish in style. At the heart
of a fantasy of silver and gilt, cherubs and massive hanging chandeliers, is
the silver and jewel-studded image of Saint James.
It is an icon up to which every visitor climbs in order to bestow an
embrace. Not a regular church-goer myself, not even a practising Christian,
I did the same, and thought of the two pilgrims still slogging, tired but
expectant, along an arrow-straight roadside somewhere in Castile.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Sport:  Left with the legend of Borotra and Hoad - Tennis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT

<TEXT>
It is one of life's hard lessons that nothing is for ever. In the past two
weeks the lesson has been particularly hard to bear with the passing of two
tennis legends who were both old friends.
On the day when the 22-year-old American Pete Sampras was adding to his fame
in this year's Wimbledon final, Lew Hoad, the great Australian champion of
the mid-1950s, died aged 59 near his home in southern Spain following a
short illness.
Like Sampras, Hoad had successfully retained his Wimbledon title in 1957,
the first post-war champion to do so. Since that day only Rod Laver, Roy
Emerson, John Newcombe, Bjorn Borg, John McEnroe, Boris Becker - and now
Sampras - have achieved the feat.
Last Sunday, 450 of us, all friends of Lew, gathered with his wife Jenny,
son Peter, and two daughters, Jane and Sally, to celebrate his life on the
lawns of their Campo de Tenis in Fuengirola. Later that day, we heard that
just across the French border, near Domaine de Pouy, his original home near
Biarritz, Jean Borotra, the Bounding Basque of French tennis in the 1920s,
had died, aged 95.
These last few days, the camera shutter of memory has clicked constantly.
There are vivid pictures of both men:
Hoad smiting that mighty backhand to destroy Ashley Cooper 6-2 6-1 6-2 in
the 1957 Wimbledon final, one of the shortest on record.
Borotra, aged 51, leaping like a gazelle for a backhand volley on the old
East Court at Queen's Club in 1949 to beat 27-year-old Geoff Paish for his
11th British covered court title.
Hoad lifting an inebriated Roger Becker to his feet at the New Fitz Club in
Bournemouth during the hard court championships of 1957 and carrying him out
to his car with one strong arm.
Borotra arriving late for a lunch of the International Club of Great Britain
and going around the room kissing the hand of every woman present.
Each man had that elusive quality, charisma, and each contributed greatly to
the evolution of the game. Borotra, without much of a serve, showed what
could be accomplished as a volleyer if you had fast enough feet, hands and
reflexes - all qualities he had developed as a pelota player in his youth.
He was also a master of match-play psychology - perhaps even the inspiration
for Stephen Potter's marvellous works on Gamesmanship and Lifemanship. He
would make a great show of donning the beret to rouse the crowd and would
delight them by leaping into the lap of a pretty girl in the front row.
He was always chivalrous and would applaud an opponent's good shots. At a
change of ends Jean might say: '. . . well done] You are hitting your
service so beautifully today - I've never seen you hit it better.' You would
spend the next five minutes wondering what made the shot special and, hey
presto, you had lost your serve.
He had tremendous energy and enthusiasm. In the 1960s, when I was managing a
British team at the French championships, Jean persuaded me to partner him
in the doubles. He was well into his 60s and insisted that we limber up in
the Bois de Boulogne prior to combat. Mercifully, we lost our first match
and I was spared further torture.
Jean was also a great patriot for whom the six years of French Davis Cup
dominance, from 1927 to 1932, with his fellow Musketeers, Henri Cochet, Rene
Lacoste and Jacques 'Toto' Brugnon, represented all that is best in sport.
The comradeship of those days - all for one, one for all - never died. All
four were dedicated to the ideals of the International Club of France,
established in 1929, following the founding of the British Club five years
earlier by Wallis Myers, a former international player who was then tennis
correspondent of the Daily Telegraph.
The two clubs have met twice a year since 1929 and Jean's incredible record
of playing in every one of them until last November - 116 in all - is surely
unique.
Borotra inspired successive generations of French players and was there at
the Davis Cup final in Lyon three years ago to see Yannick Noah's team of
Guy Forget and Henri Leconte score their famous victory over the US, led by
Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras. He shed tears of joy at the end.
Hoad, the forerunner of today's power players, had a tremendous physical
presence on court that would often intimidate opponents, although he was
actually a very shy man.
With the blond good looks of a Robert Mitchum, Hoad was also immensely
strong thanks to a training regimen that was unusually advanced for that
era.
With a powerful forearm and wrist he could hit the ball hard and early only
because he possessed sound stroke production plus a natural ability to time
the ball perfectly - essential qualities for success with a wooden racket
that was 26in long, 1in shorter than the conventional frame. One shudders to
think what devastation Hoad would have caused using a graphite frame.
Hoad's first great performance came in the Davis Cup challenge round of 1953
against the US, played in Melbourne. Harry Hopman, the Australian captain,
decided to blood the 'twins' Hoad and Ken Rosewall, who were both 19. The
key to success lay in finding a way to beat the top American, Tony Trabert.
On the opening day Trabert beat Rosewall and Hoad beat Vic Seixas. The
Americans also took the doubles, so the fourth rubber, Hoad vs Trabert,
would probably decide the tie. In a magnificent match, played in
intermittent drizzle and with both men wearing spikes, Hoad won 7-5 in the
fifth set. The next day Rosewall duly beat Seixas and the cup remained in
Australia.
Playing Hoad was an instructive experience. I had lost to him in the third
round at Wimbledon that year and remember wondering why I was so slow. When
you went to the net, the ball seemed to come at you just that bit faster
than expected. Consequently, you were late on the volley. At the baseline
the ball would bounce so close to the line that you always felt rushed.
Three years later, Hoad made everyone look slow as he beat his old friend
Rosewall to win the first of his two Wimbledon titles. Already the winner in
Australia and France in 1956, Hoad needed to win the US title to achieve the
grand slam, a feat accomplished only once before, by Don Budge in 1938. By a
twist of fate it was Rosewall who beat him in the US final.
Champions come and go but it will be a long time before we see two such
great ones again.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Sport: Lord's be praised - Cricket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For once at a Lord's Test, the focus is on the cricket rather than the
salmon en croute. South Africa are playing there for the first time in a
generation and thousands of pairs of eyes have been locked on the drama
unfolding on the field.
Sometimes, people forget that Lord's is more than five acres of manicured
turf and a sloping pitch that baffles inexperienced bowlers. It is also a
living, working monument to cricket.
I am not referring to the Jingdezen punch bowl circa 1786 exhibited in the
pavilion - a unique piece of Chinese porcelain - or to the oil paintings,
the miniature urn containing the original Ashes or the stuffed sparrow which
was struck by a delivery one day in July 1936. (Both the sparrow and the
ball were pronounced dead.) The pavilion is just one facet of a great
ground.
But there are other nooks and crannies from where you can actually see
something alive and kicking. Take the new Mound Stand, for instance. At the
top is the debenture area where the wealthy and privileged enjoy the best
view there is.
Lolling under the swirling roof feels a bit like watching the game from a
marquee with the flaps up - far better than the cramped breeze-block
hospitality boxes directly below. Within, there is an audible buzz as people
who have stumped up a cool Pounds 3,000 interest-free mingle at the bar or
loiter on the precipitous stairs. 'Do they still have sixes in cricket?'
asks a man with a fat cigar who looks about to keel over.
Most people are in blazers and slacks but down below, in the public seating,
there are panamas and large men with bare torsos ignoring the advice from
the public address that in this heat, sunburn occurs in 35 minutes. They
will have paid Pounds 38 for a seat, something of a hike from the equivalent
of 75p it would have cost a spectator the last time South Africa were at
Lord's.
The upper reaches of the Mound Stand are presided over by Eric, a jovial
Jamaican, who has stewarded at the ground since 1957. He issues passes and
greets regulars with a broad grin. He is the antithesis of the dreaded
Lord's gatemen. VIPs and hangers-on are ferried between levels by a small
lift manned by an elderly attendant who has not seen a ball bowled all day.
Directly opposite, across the field, is the Grand Stand, crowned by Old
Father Time, the weather-vane. Because of the prevailing wind, Father Time
usually has his back to the cricket. Beneath are the scorers in their
cluttered perch, putting dots in books - quite a lot while Kepler Wessels
was batting - or fiddling with computers. A woman sits in the corner
programming the electronic scoreboard.
At ground level, with barely a glimpse of the cricket, Vince and Charlie
hand-set the old Heidelberg printing press because there is an urgent demand
for more score-cards: 'We've sold 9,000 already today,' Vince says proudly.
The room has a curious aroma of inky mustiness and is a museum in its own
right, with score-cards dating back to the 1924 South African Test, old
signed bats and letters from Harold Larwood. Thursday's card was updated at
the close of play, and later a queue developed for souvenirs.
Meanwhile, Wessels, the South African captain, was chiselling runs in his
awkward, crabby way, oblivious to the masses desperate for excitement. MCC
members removed their jackets and loosened their ties and the deep
purpleness of their faces seemed ever so slightly to subside.
When the lunchers returned to their seats at about 4pm, the score had hardly
changed. 'Bit slow,' people muttered, 'but it's understandable, it's their
first match back.'
Which is not quite true, of course. This Test is actually the South
Africans' 15th since re-admission to world cricket 2 1/2 years ago, and they
have become a tough, resilient unit, if not a devastating one.
Their cricket has been full of great commitment and passion, with just one
ironic twist. The South African team is still all-white; their most talented
black player, Jacob Mulao, a Sowetan left-arm spinner seconded to the MCC
this summer, was in a small booth selling score-cards.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Motoring: Promise unfulfilled - Stuart Marshall asks why
four-wheel drive is not more common
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Audi unveiled the first Quattro at the Geneva Show in 1980, it seemed
that all high-performance cars of the future would have full-time four-wheel
drive. Having tried it, I certainly thought so.
The ease with which this potent turbo-charged coupe could be driven quickly
and safely on surfaces ranging from dry tarmac to loose gravel and frozen
slush was a new experience.
That was in 1980. Actually, the Quattro was not the first 4x4 road car of
its kind. Jensen had beaten Audi to it by some years with the FF model. But
Jensen made only a small number of FFs and, sadly, I never got my hands on
one. The Quattro started a trend that other volume makers followed.
Four-wheel drive has since swept the world of rallying but not of normal
motoring. For road cars, it is a story of promise unfulfilled. Audi still
offers the quattro with all-wheel drive transmission on its complete range.
There have been - in some cases there still are - all-wheel driven versions
of cars such as the Ford Scorpio and BMW 5-Series, Porsche 911 and Peugeot
405.
They are, however, a minority choice. And most of the really
high-performance cars - Ferraris, Aston-Martins, BMW 8-Series, Mercedes SL
and so on - are rear-wheel driven. Motorists associate four-wheel drive
road-going vehicles mainly with keeping going in snow. Very good they are at
it, too. (Paradoxically, 4x4 on-off roaders are much less popular in
Lapland, where winter lasts for six months, than in England's
lifestyle-conscious home counties. Northern Scandinavians rely on spiked
snow tyres and, to a growing extent, traction control.)
By matching power output to tyre grip a traction control system (TCS) curbs
wheelspin on slippery surfaces. Cars fitted with it are unfazed by snowy
hills. Just as significantly, they do not become unruly if accelerated
savagely, or cornered imprudently fast, on wet roads.
TCS is now standard on some cars with an abundance of power (such as the
latest turbocharged Rover 600ti and Vitesse Sport) and offered by
manufacturers as an option on others. They have been persuaded that it gives
many of the benefits of permanently engaged four-wheel drive without the
extra weight, complication and cost.
Subaru begs to differ. It is wedded to four-wheel drive. Apart from a
recently introduced front-wheel driven entry model Impreza family saloon or
hatchback, it has sold nothing but four-wheel drive cars for years.
Currently they range from the tiny Vivio (Pounds 7,047), supermini-sized
Justy (from Pounds 8,149), Impreza 4WD (from Pounds 12,849) and Legacy
(Pounds 13,999 upwards) to the stunning SVX, at Pounds 30,849 perhaps the
most pleasurable high-performance coupe I have driven.
When Subarus were first sold in Britain more than 20 years ago they had a
simple kind of selectable four-wheel drive. Normally, the power went to the
front wheels. When you felt the need for extra traction, you switched it
through to the rear wheels as well.
These early Subarus had high and low ranges of gears in four-wheel drive and
were astonishingly capable off-road. Just how good I discovered on a
military vehicle testing ground. Over terrain many owners of full-blooded
on-off road 4x4s would not dream of venturing on, the Subaru just kept
going, climbing 1-in-3 slopes, sliding its well-protected underside over
high humps and plunging through wellie-deep water.
Of course, knowing that a monster cross-country vehicle is ready to pull you
out should you get stuck makes one feel very brave. I would not have gone
where I did if my only recovery equipment had been a shovel. But country
people who really have to drive across their own muddy fields and pull sheep
trailers up steep hills know Subarus are very hard workers. Yet they behave
like normal cars on proper roads.
The latest Subaru to come my way was the 208 horsepower Impreza Turbo 2000
4WD. In common with all Subarus, apart from the Vivio microcar, it has an
engine with horizontally-opposed cylinders - the kind Germans call a boxer.
Like its Ford counterpart, the Escort RS Cosworth, it is based on a rally
car but has been civilised for road use.
It has far more performance than could possibly be exploited on the highway:
a top speed of 142mph/229kph and 0-60mph/96kph acceleration of 6.3 seconds
are claimed.
What its four-wheel drive means in day-to-day motoring is complete
sure-footedness regardless of road surface. The Impreza has power steering,
driver's airbag and anti-lock braking as standard at Pounds 17,499 for the
4-door saloon, and Pounds 17,998 for the 5-door hatchback. Its insurance
group is 17 compared with an Escort Cosworth's 20 and it comes with a
three-year/60,000 mile (96,600km) warranty.
The ride is firm, with some tyre thump, and the transmission majors on
ruggedness. It seats four comfortably, five at a pinch, and has ample
luggage space. But with all that eager performance it is not a car I would
recommend to anyone with driving licence penalty points.

FT  23 JUL 94 / The legacy of Stauffenberg: The attempt to kill Hitler - and
its lasting impact 50 years on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Count Colonel Claus Schenk von Stauffenberg left the Berlin suburb of
Wannsee for the military airport at Rangsdorf at 7am on the morning of July
20 1944. His adjutant, Werner von Haeften, was waiting for him. Together
they flew to Hitler's HQ, the so-called Wolfschanze, or Wolf's Lair, at
Rastenburg in East Prussia.
Count Stauffenberg was chief of staff to General Friedrich Fromm, head of
the Replacement Army. In theory, Stauffenberg was flying to Rastenburg to
arrange the creation of two new divisions to protect East Prussia, Germany's
eastern-most province, from imminent Russian attack.
In fact, his mission was to assassinate Hitler, a plan that had been years
in the making, and his briefcase contained 4lb of explosive.
At the briefing, Stauffenberg sat close to Hitler and placed his briefcase
under the table. Soon after, he left the room.
He and Haeften heard the explosion as they got into their car and could see
a plume of smoke rising from the bunker. By 1.15pm, Stauffenberg was
Berlin-bound and convinced that the bomb had done the trick.
But Hitler was not dead: his eardrums had been pierced, his trousers
shredded and his elbow badly bruised, but he had survived.
Confused reports reached Berlin. General Fellgiebel, the signals' chief, was
able to call his fellow conspirator Colonel Kurt Hahn in nearby Mauersdorf
before a communications blackout was imposed: 'Something's gone wrong,' he
said, 'the Fuhrer's alive.'
Reports that Hitler had emerged unscathed from the debris caused the
conspirators to dither in the Bendlerblock HQ in Berlin, from where they
were supposed to issue the Walkure orders - orders which would have led to
the take-over of the government and a negotiated peace with the allies. The
delay scuppered any remaining chances of success.
By the time Stauffenberg reached the Bendlerblock at about 3.30pm, Fromm had
discovered from Field Marshal Keitel, who had also survived the blast, that
Hitler had survived. When Stauffenberg arrived, Fromm told him the news. But
Stauffenberg was adamant: 'He is dead. I saw him carried out . . . The
explosion was as if the hut had been hit by a 6in shell. It is hardly
possible that anyone could be alive . . . Keitel is lying as usual.'
Concerned, Fromm refused to co-operate with the plotters and was arrested
and taken away.
According to the Walkure orders, the administrative centre of Berlin was to
be sealed off by the guards battalion and troops from the training schools
on the edge of the city.
Outside the Bendlerblock, other conspirators, including the young Rhodes
scholar, Adam von Trott zu Solz of the foreign office in the Wilhelmstrasse,
realised the attempt had taken place when they saw Berlin's centre closed
off by guards.
He watched the street anxiously from the window. To his relief the traffic
ceased and soldiers appeared. But three hours later, they shouldered arms
and marched off.
Hans Bernd von Haeften, brother of Stauffenberg's adjutant, was not slow to
draw the obvious conclusion that the Nazi forces had regained control. He
turned 'as white as a sheet'.
The Nazis survived thanks to Joseph Goebbels and Major Ernst Remer of the
guards battalion. Goebbels convinced Remer to speak to Hitler on the
telephone. Hitler put Remer in charge of operations against the conspirators
and promoted him on the spot. Later Remer would repay his trust by founding
one of Germany's first, post-war neo-Nazi parties.
Remer's men stormed the Bendlerblock. In the fray Stauffenberg was shot
twice and wounded. It was Fromm, released from captivity, who arrested the
ring-leaders. At 12.30am the conspirators were taken to the courtyard to be
shot. As Stauffenberg passed a familiar secretary he said: 'They all left me
in the lurch.' As he was led before the firing squad, the faithful Haeften
tried to throw himself between Stauffenberg and the bullets.
'Long live our sacred Germany,' shouted Stauffenberg. Then he collapsed and
died.
The assassination attempt of July 20 1944 was the fruit of plans laid in the
autumn of 1938. Colonel General Ludwig Beck had resigned as chief of the
general staff in protest at Hitler's plans to invade Czechoslovakia. His
civilian counterpart was Carl Goerdeler, the indefatigable former mayor of
Leipzig.
In the intervening years the conspiracy brought together a powerful cadre of
anti-Nazis - noblemen, officers, churchmen, trades unionists, socialist
politicians, diplomats and civil servants. Goerdeler busied himself with the
structure of the future government and drew up detailed lists of its
potential members.
These lists were to be the downfall of many. Of the 5,000 or so people
executed after July 20, only about 200 were actually implicated in the plot.
The rest were simply prominent opponents of the regime: the core of a future
Germany. The purge was to be one last great act of spite, a final attempt to
prevent Germany's post-war reconstruction. The SS was still murdering
prisoners as the Russians entered Berlin.
Officially, little mention was made of the plot before the creation of the
two German republics in 1949. The first time it was celebrated was in 1953,
just a month after an abortive uprising in the Russian zone of June 17. The
few east Berliners who fled to the west were encamped in the courtyard of
the Bendlerblock, and it was there that the mayor, Ernst Reuter, chose to
remind them of the martyrs of that earlier revolt against dictatorship.
Since the mid-1950s the July plot has been marked by a ceremony at
Plotzensee prison in Berlin, where many of the men of July 20 met their
deaths. But despite the hundreds of books which have been published on the
subject, little is made of it in schools.
Clarita Muller-Plantenberg, only a few months old when von Trott, her
father, was executed at Plotzensee, recalls that the girls at school treated
her differently. Many had lost fathers in the war, but they knew that she
was special: 'They thought I must be Jewish and stayed off the subject.'
Later she remembers a teacher blushing to admit that he approved of the men
of July 20 and what they stood for.
In a number of cases there was a reluctance to honour the dead of July 20 in
their hometowns and villages. Von Trott's brothers erected an impressive
cross in the woods above the family manor house at Imshausen, but in the
village church the verger resisted the idea of a monument.
It was the mid-1980s before von Trott's name appeared in the church, and
then only as part of a general plaque commemorating the dead of the second
world war. There were still a few Germans who saw the plotters as traitors.
There was also a natural tendency to see the leaders of the coup as a last
flowering of another Germany, no longer relevant to either of the two states
created after the war. The romantic history focused on the aristocratic
officers rather than the civilians of the plot.
The Grundgesetz of 1949 was to reaffirm the Weimar constitution's Article I
which abolished noble titles. The new Bundeswehr was also established with
the expressed desire to rid the armed forces of all connection with the
Prussian military tradition. Prussia itself, which had supplied much of the
core of the resistance, was rudely rubbed off the map in February 1947, its
eastern provinces being parcelled out among the Russians and the Poles.
It can be safely said that Stauffenberg's 'sacred Germany' bore little or no
resemblance to either the Federal Republic or the Democratic Republic.
But the plot still counts for something in Bonn and appears to be a useful
entry on a curriculum vitae. President Richard von Weizsacker, for example,
doubtless derived credibility from his father Ernst. While he was at the
helm of the foreign office, it was barely tainted with Nazism, and many of
his proteges went on to become ambassadors after the war.
For von Trott's widow, also named Clarita, July 20 is more important than
ever now that the two halves of Germany have been united. With the increase
in racial violence she feels that the young need role models who will teach
them how to react to blatant injustice.
But perhaps the real proof that German politicians still feel the need to
show themselves the heirs to Stauffenberg, Beck or Goerdeler is provided by
Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor himself. On July 20 of this election year
he decided that he alone would enjoy the right to address the faithful in
the grim execution chamber at Plotzensee Prison.
Giles MacDonogh's Prussia. The Perversion of an Idea, was published this
week by Sinclair-Stevenson (Pounds 20). There is a paperback edition of his
book, A Good German: Adam von Trott zu Solz, from Quartet (Pounds 10.99).

FT  23 JUL 94 / Survivor waits to be made welcome: Maurice Samuelson talks
to an anti-Nazi conspirator who has been fighting for justice for 40 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAURICE SAMUELSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Instead of attending Berlin's 50th anniversary of the bid to kill Adolf
Hitler, one of the leading survivors of the conspiracy remained this week in
self-imposed exile from his beloved Germany.
Dr Otto John, 85, told me he spent the day looking out at the spectacular
mountains of the Austrian Tyrol, his home for the past 27 years.
As a result of a stroke he can no longer walk and can write only with great
difficulty, leaving him dependent on his secretary, the housekeeper who
comes every day, and on his gardener.
But this is not why he stayed away from the Berlin ceremony.
It was because, instead of being one of the acclaimed heroes of Germany,
John has for the past 40 years been an unperson, a political embarrassment
to the Federal Republic and, in the eyes of many, victim of a terrible
miscarriage of justice.
Five years after the war he was appointed the first president of the Federal
Republic's Office for the Protection of the Constitution, a sensitive
intelligence unit intended to counter a resurgence of Nazism and Communist
subversion.
On July 20 1954, the 10th anniversary of the anti-Hitler plot, John attended
the commemoration of the plot in Berlin. Later that day he disappeared and
turned up in the Soviet sector of the city, where he criticised trends in
West Germany, including the lingering influence of the Nazis.
He has claimed ever since that he was drugged and kidnapped as part of a
Soviet operation to destabilise the west and that his remarks were made
under duress. He also insisted that he had betrayed no state secrets.
That was his plea when, 18 months later, he escaped back to the west. He was
tried for treason and sentenced to four years hard labour , double the term
demanded by the prosecuting counsel at the high court in Karlsruhe.
For 40 years, John has maintained his innocence and claimed his treatment by
the court was influenced by a desire to punish him for his role in the
anti-Hitler underground and by the fact that while others were executed
after the failure of the plot, he had survived to continue the fight against
Hitler.
General Reinhard Gehlen, former Nazi and head of the Federal Republic's
counter-intelligence network set up after the war by the Americans, said of
John's apparent defection to east Berlin: 'Once a traitor, always a
traitor.'
After his release from prison, his reputation in tatters, John set out to
clear his name. As far as public opinion is concerned, he largely succeeded.
Leading politicians, such as the late Defence Minister Franz-Josef Strauss,
and Dr Gerhard Schroeder, a former interior and foreign minister, accepted
that John was a victim, rather than a collaborator of the Soviets, and that
he had not betrayed his country.
But three times, John failed to overturn the judgment of the Karlsruhe
court. He vowed that until he succeeded he would never again attend a
commemorative meeting for the heroes of the July 20 conspiracy.
In Moscow last year, however, John met two of the former KGB officers who
had interrogated him in Berlin and Moscow immediately after his
disappearance.
They have since made sworn affidavits at the German embassy in Moscow
indicating he was not a defector but that he had been abducted by agents of
the KGB as part of the cold war.
Two weeks ago, a lawyer acting on John's behalf incorporated their
statements in a new application to have the case reopened.
If the court agrees, there is a chance that John's reputation will at last
be vindicated and he will no longer feel an outsider in his own country.
'I hope that the new generation of German judges will be different from the
ones who first sentenced me,' he said on the telephone this week.
Meanwhile, there is no controversy about his role in the events of July 20
1944 and in the struggle leading to Hitler's final overthrow.
A few hours after the bomb went off in Hitler's field headquarters at
Rastenburg on the morning of July 20, John was personally briefed by the man
who had laid it near Hitler's feet - Count Colonel Claus Schenk von
Stauffenberg.
John had been in touch with leading anti-Nazis since 1937. His friends
included Klaus and Dietrich Bonhoeffer, two of the leading martyrs of the
German resistance.
From 1942, John had used his position as legal adviser to Lufthansa, the
German airline, to act as the German resistance's liaison with British
intelligence. (The MI6 officer who evaluated it in London was Graham Greene,
according to the new biography published this week, Graham Greene, The Man
Within, by Michael Shelden, Heinemann.)
Immediately after the events of July 20 1944, John escaped first to Spain
and then, via Lisbon, to Britain, where he aided the BBC's anti-Nazi
propaganda, interrogated high-ranking German prisoners of war and, later,
assisted the prosecutors at Nuremberg.
However, in an ominous foretaste of John's later maltreatment by the
Soviets, his entry to Britain was resisted by Soviet master-spy Kim Philby,
who was Graham Greene's boss in MI6's Iberian Department. Stalin suspected
that any contacts between Britain and the anti-Hitler resistance could have
led to a separate peace between Germany and the west. During his 18 months
of captivity in the Soviet Union he was repeatedly questioned about the
possibility of such a deal.
John's main new Moscow witness, regarding the events of 1954, is ex-KGB
General Eugen Panyushkin who, John says, interrogated him in Berlin and
Moscow. At that time, Panyushkin used the cover name 'Chernov'.
But he is not sure that his appeal, if held, will succeed, and because of
his age he would probably be dead by the time that happened. 'I have had
many disappointments over the years,' he said.
Today, John's strongest supporter, and closest friend, is 86-year-old Prince
Louis Ferdinand, head of the Prussian former royal family. If the court
allows his new appeal, John is expected to stay at the prince's home in
Berlin during the court hearings.

hangs out in a hippy-filled corner of Rajastan / Pushkar, India

A teenage girl with wide eyes and pierced nose was being led by one arm down
to the holy lake. A bearded sadhu with a bare chest pressed flowers, sweets
and a few grains of rice into her hand. 'This is the ancient puja ceremony,'
he said, thumbing a red dot on to her forehead.
'It's so cool,' said the girl, who was called Caroline and was spending a
year in India before her first term at Oxford.
'Repeat after me,' said the holy man. 'I pray for health, happiness and
success . . . and I make a donation of 100 rupees.'
Caroline woke briefly from the spell. '100] How about 50?' The man suggested
60. 'That's cool,' she replied, with a wide smile.
Pushkar is a small, pretty town built around an oasis on the edge of a
desert in Rajastan. According to Hindu legend the god Brahma dropped a lotus
flower there and a lake sprang up at the spot. For more than 3,000 years,
devotees have travelled from across India to worship at some of its 400
temples. Around 90 per cent of Pushkar's 11,000-strong population is
connected with the priesthood; the other 10 per cent appear to work in the
tourist trade. Some people, like Caroline's friend, dabble in both.
Pushkar's tranquility, idyllic setting and air of authentic spirituality
have made it a popular pit-stop on the Indian tourist circuit. Many visitors
find it an antidote to the chaos of the big cities and stay for weeks at
cheap backstreet guest houses. As a result, unsuspecting Pushkar has become
a hippy hangout.
Along the narrow main street, dodging cows and bicycles and holy men and
beggar-women, stroll Europe's drop-outs in tie-dye trousers and embroidered
waistcoats. Following them from shop doorways come familiar whispers: 'Hello
friend, good hash, change money, buy something.'
Because Pushkar is a holy place, alcohol, meat and even eggs are banned, and
signs warn foreigners against kissing in public. Yet almost anything else
seems possible: you can get a shave and a massage in five languages, buy
uncut rubies and chocolate biscuits, drink milk-shakes and eat Chinese and
swap your copy of Midnight's Children for a dog-eared City of Joy, or Zen
and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. One shop front promised: 'Ear and
Nose Hole Possible Here.'
At 6am it was still dark as dozens of temple bells rang to summon the
faithful to icy dips in the lake. Pilgrims, shivering and fully-clothed,
bathed at the white-washed ghats lining the shore.
At the top of a steep hill overlooking the town there is a 2,000-year-old
temple where a sad-looking priest swathed in saffron gave me a cup of
steaming tea as we watched the sunrise together. Through my telephoto lens
he studied the squat buildings below, clustered around the tiny square of
water. Then he asked how much the camera cost: 'More than 10 English
pounds?'
Distant drums pounded as the rising heat brought the desert to life. Monkeys
appeared and parrots, then great vultures launched themselves into the air
with a single flap of their wings, circled slowly and returned to their
branches to wait.
On the path back into town a small boy was herding goats as a pair of wild
peacocks danced through the dust. At Sanjay's Rooftop Restaurant there were
fairy lights above the door: too late for Diwali, too early for Christmas.
Over a breakfast of porridge and honey toast I listened to two dazed German
hippies argue about how much dope they had smoked the previous evening,
until their slurred protestations were drowned out by a screeching tape
playing one, seemingly interminable song: 'Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna,
Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare . . .'
Outside, a sadu with long white beard and ashtray specs, as skinny as a dog,
was washing himself under a banyan tree. He reached with a bar of soap into
the depths of his loin cloth and a hippy girl in beads and sandals averted
her eyes.
By mid-morning the first pilgrims had arrived: Indian families on day trips
from Delhi and Jaipur clutching packed lunches and drinks flasks. As they
hurried from one holy place to another dressed in ill-fitting suits and
Sunday-best saris, they threw bemused glances at the brightly-coloured
hippies.
At the red-spired temple dedicated to Brahma, beside a sign saying 'Donate
For Cows', a smartly-dressed young man clutched my hand and said: 'Give me
your address and we will be best friends.' Disarmed, I obliged, although I
am still waiting for him to write.
The temple floor was carved with memorial stones and, beside the names of
the dead, the marble was inlaid with silver rupees bearing the heads of
George V and Edward VII, reminders of an earlier, western presence.
For one week in November, Pushkar bursts into life and colour when its
annual camel fair attracts up to 200,000 villagers from across Rajastan.
Prices at hotels and restaurants soar and the barefoot budget travellers
move out to make way for well-heeled tourists and film crews from Tokyo,
Paris and New York.
When the dust has settled and tariffs have fallen back to earth, the hippies
return to find the same bars blaring out the same old Rolling Stones
records, the shops selling the same Kashmiri carpets - possibly silk,
possibly not.
Those who linger in Pushkar perhaps know it is not the 'real India' - no
single place could encapsulate the seething sub-continent - but this desert
oasis is closer to their dreams of India than the heaving, polluted cities
that surround it.
And everyone is a winner in such a glittering collision of cultures. The
grinning Indians provide colour and chicanery, blessings and badly-made
clothes. In return, the west sends its great unwashed - gangly youths with
tattoos and matted hair who exchange hard currencies for a piece of potted
mysticism and cheap, worthless bangles and beads.
At the Palace Hotel, a former home of the Maharaja of Kishangarh and now, at
Pounds 5 a night, the most expensive place to stay in Pushkar, guests were
taking their positions for cocktail hour. We sat on the lawn in wicker
chairs to watch the sun dip behind far-away hills turning the sky pink and
gold.
Expert advice was offered as to the exact moment to take photographs ('Now
man] This is it, perfect, take the thing]'). The sound of temple bells
drifted on the evening breeze and, in the parched section of the lake,
schoolboys played cricket with a home-made bat.
Later I returned to Sanjay's Rooftop Restaurant. The same tape was playing.
'Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare.' Only this time the
shrill, insistent tones seemed strangely soothing. I ordered a banana
milkshake.
