FT  23 JUL 94 / FT Ski Expedition: Where only the rain is free
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world expedition. This week in Argentina they completed 200 days.
It has scarcely stopped raining since we limped into Argentina in our
borrowed Lada vehicle, which seems to be working on one cylinder and half a
gearbox.
Skiing conditions here have been abysmal: like skiing on frozen meringues in
a monsoon. Heini Kempel, director of the Escquela Esqui Catedral, the main
ski school at Gran Catedral, the ski area of Bariloche, was frantic:
'Conditions are terrible,' he said. 'They have had to close most of the top
half of the mountain because of high winds and rain. We are in big trouble.'
But our welcome has been as warm as the weather has been wet. The scenery
too is magnificent: no volcanoes in this part of the Andes, but a
spectacular lake, Nahuel Huapi (Island of the Tiger, in the language of the
Araucano indians).
The only drawback is the cost of everything: Argentina can be almost as
expensive as Japan. Only the rain is free.
The Cerro Bayo resort is the brainchild of Jean-Pierre Raemdonck, a lanky,
bespectacled Belgian who came to Argentina as a student on a motorcycle and
never left. He tried selling waffles in Bariloche but was unable to secure
his own waffle concession.
'So I decided to build my own ski area in order to sell my waffles,' he
said. With no experience (he could not even ski) he hacked his way through
dense forest, using oxen to clear the trails.
'I put the second lift together on my own,' he said. 'Well, I had a helper
but he got drunk all the time. We could only afford the lifts, but not the
lift towers. We made a bull-wheel from an old motorbike and made our own
towers from trees. They lasted for years.'
His resort has developed into a minor gem.
Perhaps he could repair our Lada's tortured gearbox. Even our Hewlett
Packard OmniBook computer has started disrespectfully urging me to 'Get Help
or Start Interactive Lessons'.
Perhaps like Hal, the spaceship's computer in the film 2001, it is trying to
take over our mission.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Dr, about this alien . . .: Christina Lamb meets an eminent
Harvard professor who believes that large-scale cosmic rape has been taking
place on earth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An anti-rational boom is sweeping America and, suddenly, I do not feel I
missed out on the 1960s. Recently, four of the 10 best-selling books were on
themes of near-death experiences, spirituality, and the immortality of love
and consciousness.
Psychics and palmists' salons are proliferating and weighty magazine
articles are questioning memory, some even denying the Holocaust. Men and
women are seeking happiness through wonder drugs such as Prozac and are
forming electronic communities on Internet with people they have never seen.
It was just a matter of time before someone added unidentified flying
objects to this potent mix. Recently, book store displays were joined by a
weighty tome about little grey aliens with blank eyes abducting large
numbers of Americans and forcing them to have sex inside spaceships,
followed by lectures on ecology.
It would be easy to dismiss Abduction (published in the UK and US by
Scribners) as crazy except for one detail. Dr John Mack, its 64-year-old
author, is an eminent Harvard professor and psychiatrist and winner of the
Pulitzer prize for his previous book, a biography of TE Lawrence. He used
clinical methods to interview 90 people who claim to have been abducted (13
appear in the book). And he believes them.
Or so he says. On a sunny spring morning in Cambridge, Massachusetts, I met
Mack inside a wooden box of a house with a yard full of tangled weeds. Tired
from appearances on such talk shows as Oprah Winfrey and Larry King, he
asked about the FT's circulation before settling on a pink velvet chaise
longue to tell how he moved from scepticism to believing in large-scale
cosmic rape.
According to the publisher's hype, one in 50 Americans has experienced an
alien encounter. Mack was introduced to the phenomenon by Budd Hopkins, a
New York-based artist and father of the UFO abduction movement, whom he met
in January 1990. Hopkins told him of more than 200 people across the US who
had, apparently, been kidnapped by aliens.
Mack recalls: 'My first reaction was that there must be something wrong with
him and that he was dealing with some contemporary form of mental illness.
But I met the people and they were of sound mind, telling their stories
reluctantly, scared of being ridiculed.
'Their stories were so similar, and told with such intensity and detail,
that they could not be explained psychiatrically. It could only be real
experience. That shook me up. If it's real, what is it?' He began seeing
abductees in spring 1990 and says that only a handful of the 90 he has
interviewed have some form of mental illness or effects of a trauma.
In his book, he details a handy do-it-yourself guide on how to recognise
when you are experiencing an alien abduction and not simply the effects of
overwork or excess alcohol. Abductions usually begin at home in bed or while
driving at night. The first sign is a flood of blue or white light, an odd
hum or sighting of a being or craft. A beam of light then floats you through
the wall into a spaceship.
In a large room, lined with flashing computer consoles, small grey beings
with large heads and long arms undress the abductee and remove hair, skin
and sperm samples. Female abductees are often impregnated and the foetus
later removed.
Mack's book quotes Ed, who remembers a silver-blonde alien woman taking a
sperm sample from him inside a 'pod' while at high school 30 years earlier;
Dave, who as a child had his pants removed behind a bush by aliens; Jenny,
who gave birth to a human alien hybrid; and Peter, who had an alien wife in
a 'parallel universe'.
These are aliens with a purpose - to save us from ourselves. After being
raped or examined, abductees are lectured on how mankind is destroying the
earth. Images, given either telepathically or through giant screens, show
vast areas of polluted water or parts of the planet disintegrating.
If the true motive of the little grey men is to turn us green, why are they
not appearing to world leaders or those who could do something to ward off
this impending ecological catastrophe?
Mack claims they are. 'Prestigious people are worried about their
reputations so they don't want their identities revealed. We have good
evidence that one world leader, at least, has been taken. We've talked to
him and he doesn't deny it.'
He adds: 'I have patients from all walks of society. A prison guard and
female gas station attendant, at one end of the spectrum, to a prominent
business executive, high-level diplomat and someone running for Congress at
the other.'
The first known abduction case was in 1957 in Brazil, a country with a fine
line between reality and fiction. In the US, the first documented case
occurred in 1966. Betty and Barney Hill, a retired couple who had got lost
one night in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, underwent hypnosis and
'remembered' being kidnapped by aliens. Their experience led to books, films
and TV dramas.
Abduction appears to be almost entirely a US phenomenon. Mack says this is
simply because the country has a large number of trained psychotherapists to
help people 'remember'. But there is much controversy at present over
aggressive, memory-enhancing techniques used by therapists to 'recall'
events so traumatic that, apparently, they had been repressed.
A California court recently awarded Dollars 500,000 (Pounds 329,000) to a
father who accused therapists of conning his bulimia-afflicted adult
daughter into 'remembering' childhood incidents of incest that he said had
never occurred. As a result of her charges, the man lost his job and his
wife.
Mack gives little detail on his methodology except to say that it involves
hypnosis and breathing techniques. He writes that 'memory of an abduction
may be outside of consciousness until triggered' and sweeps away suggestions
that his subjects were people already familiar with UFO literature.
'These are real powerful emotions from the core of their being,' he says.
'We can't invent memories like that. Furthermore, there are physical
findings - cuts, scoop marks, lacerated and triangular lesions, implants and
inexplicable nose-bleeds. Accounts of abductions often coincide with other
reports of UFOs in the vicinity.' He adds: 'Maybe the phenomenon is
mysterious and has no place in our world view. But it's not false.
'The problem is with western culture, which is just not ready to accept the
idea of life on other planets. Other cultures, like native American and
Buddhist, don't have problems with this. But we have become so arrogant that
we don't want to think we are not in control. No other people in the history
of mankind has been so denying of the existence of other intelligence.'
That said, he rubs his blue eyes and says: 'I think you've got enough
there,' before moving wearily on to the next interview. Even aliens, it
seems, need publicity.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Minding Your Own Business: The right direction - A business
which succeeded from day one
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Edinburgh Financial Publishing was a success from the word go. According to
Jeremy Salvesen, its co-founder: 'It is the only business I've known where
one put in an amount of capital on day one and never for a single day was
the bank balance less than the capital.'
The company started life in 1990 as Directus. Angus MacDonald, a 26-year-old
fund manager in Edinburgh, had, like others, noticed that when directors of
a quoted company bought or sold its shares this often signalled it was a
good time for others to follow suit.
A company in Birmingham named BRI had long provided a rudimentary service
mailing brokers and fund managers with details of these transactions based
on stock exchange announcements. MacDonald had the idea of providing a
better, computer-based service, and took it to Salvesen, a computer expert.
'Angus used to come to me with ideas on a regular basis,' says Salvesen,
aged 30. 'This struck me as a good one and would combine my computer skills
with his as a salesman.'
Directus would fax customers with full details of directors' dealings within
hours of the announcement. It entailed creating a database that would enable
it to put the transactions in context.
'The actual transaction is meaningless if you don't know the background,'
says Salvesen.
'A director may sell Pounds 10,000 worth of shares but keep Pounds 1m, or he
may be selling to fund a divorce settlement. We would get details from the
company and fax customers a graph showing the share price with previous
directors' dealings marked in.'
The two men began Directus from a large cupboard in Salvesen's office in
Edinburgh. Salvesen says it did not actually need start-up capital because
clients would buy a year's subscription in advance. However, to indicate
their commitment each of them put in Pounds 10,000.
While Salvesen processed the information and issued the faxes, MacDonald,
who had earlier served a short commission in the army and is described by
some as a 'selling machine', toured brokers, signing them up to the service,
for which Directus was asking twice as much as BRI was charging.
It was an immediate success. Directus met its first year's sales target in
three months and within a year had acquired BRI. In its first 10 months of
trading, turnover was Pounds 137,000; a year later it had reached Pounds
437,000.
Directus began contributing a weekly summary of directors' dealings to the
Weekend FT, and still does. And it produces weekly and monthly editions of a
newsletter, The Inside Track, for private investors.
Colin Rogers, a stockbroker, has joined the company and Salvesen has left to
buy Duncans of Scotland, a chocolate bar maker, becoming non-executive vice
chairman of EFP under MacDonald.
The directors' dealings service now makes up only about 10 per cent of the
turnover of Edinburgh Financial Publishing, the company's new name. Turnover
reached Pounds 2.2m in the year to March and its flagship product today is
the Estimate Directory.
Fund managers had grumbled to MacDonald about the immense volume of research
material poured out by analysts which they were expected to digest daily.
The company came up with a summary of brokers' profit forecasts, listed by
company and updated every month with changes highlighted.
Some 300 subscriptions to the Estimate Directory were sold before the first
edition went to press and it now sells more than 2,500 subscriptions a year.
It competes with two online services, but MacDonald says many brokers prefer
looking up the data in a book.
Soon, said Rogers, brokers were crying out for directories covering other
markets. EFP decided to start with the Pacific Basin, an English-speaking
area with strong market potential. It recognised that the main market for
the new directory would be in the region itself.
MacDonald went to Hong Kong in late 1992 with 30 copies of the first issue
of EFP's Estimate Directory - Pacific Basin, covering more than 1,000
companies in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Australia and New
Zealand.
'Within two months it had taken Hong Kong by storm,' Rogers says. MacDonald
recruited a salesman and started selling in Singapore, Malaysia and
Thailand. He also found plentiful new publishing opportunities in the Far
East.
EFP (Asia) now produces a daily digest of the business press in Pacific
countries, which is compiled in English at dawn each day, and faxed to
brokers and investors in the area and in Europe.
The Hong Kong company recently launched a handbook of Hong Kong companies,
and is working on handbooks for Singapore and Malaysia.
Meanwhile the Edinburgh operation, run by Rogers, launched The Estimate
Directory - Europe, covering European companies, and recently opened a sales
office in Paris. It now has one in New York and is working on ways of
delivering its services electronically.
What strikes one about EFP is its can-do mentality and its youth. Its oldest
director is 33. Its sales staff work on commission and offer ingenious
discounts. When it celebrated the opening of new offices in Edinburgh a few
months ago virtually none of the old guard of the Scottish financial
community was in evidence.
It now employs about 25 people in Edinburgh and a similar number in Hong
Kong. Its Hong Kong turnover is expected more than to double from Pounds
650,000 in 1994 to Pounds 1.3m in 1995, while its UK sales should grow from
Pounds 1.56m to Pounds 2.2m.
Nevertheless, MacDonald says a stock exchange quotation for EFP is a long
way off. 'I'd love to run a quoted company but the only reason to do so
would be to make acquisitions. We can't find anything that isn't very
expensive and the stock market doesn't give small companies proper
treatment.'

FT  23 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: A guide to the lenders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For information on the many organisations which operate as building
societies, a browse through the Moneyfacts Building Society Directory* is
instructive.
Covering all 84 societies, it shows the full range of the sector - from the
mighty Halifax to the small societies which lend mainly within walking
distance of their head offices.
It also includes a new feature detailing the disappearance of societies
through mergers. If you have been kept awake at nights wondering what became
of the Magnet &amp; Planet or the Kent Reliance, this is the volume for you.
For existing societies, the directory gives year-end balance sheets along
with some other key financial statistics. Information about subsidiaries and
available banking services also is provided, along with details of auditors,
solicitors and relationships (if any) between societies and life insurance
companies.
What the book does not do is set out all the statistical information -
including addresses for each branch - to be found in the Building Societies
Yearbook (published by the Building Societies Association), or analyse how
each of the larger societies performed against its competitors (the basis of
the UBS Building Society Major Players annual survey).
Still, at Pounds 19.95, it is much cheaper than either BSA (Pounds 55 for
the latest edition) or UBS (almost Pounds 200 last year).
Perhaps next time, though, it could include the range during the year of the
rates paid to, or by, existing savers and borrowers as well as the best and
worst deals offered to new customers.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Incompetent solicitors
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My wife and I bought our main residence in Billericay, Essex, in November
1987 for Pounds 210,000. As our main residence it is, of course, exempt from
capital gains tax.
In April 1993, we purchased a flat in London. It is our understanding that,
within two years of the second purchase, we must declare which of these
properties will be our main residence for CGT exemption purposes. If we opt
for the London flat, can we index-link the price of the Billericay house
from the date of purchase in 1987, or does the indexation apply from April
1993 only?
Also, would we need to have the house valued at that time if indexation is
applicable from April 1993?
Your solicitors - who appear to be incompetent - should have suggested that,
at the very least, you ask your tax office for CGT4, the free explanatory
pamphlet for owner-occupiers. You should now do just that.
You will see from the CGT4 that indexation on both properties runs from
their respective purchase contract dates; thus, the value of the Billericay
house in April 1993 is irrelevant.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: No interest in a Tessa
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I took out a tax-exempt special savings account (Tessa) with the
Co-operative Bank when they were launched. The interest rate then was 14 per
cent with a 1 per cent bonus if kept for five years.
Recently, the bank sent me a newsletter which included details of all its
interest rates. The Tessa is now just over 5 per cent.
That was bad enough; worse was the statement that if you pull out capital
before five years, you lose all the interest. I rang the bank and asked if
this was true; when told it was, I immediately stopped my standing order.
I have never touched the interest. If I withdraw that and then close the
account, could the bank deduct the equivalent interest from my capital?
With regard to the withdrawal of capital from your Tessa: it is true that
any withdrawal within the first five years will lead to a loss of all tax
advantages.
There is no pro-rata relief if any sum of the capital is withdrawn.
Furthermore, any interest credited up to the date of the withdrawal will
become taxable income for the year in which the withdrawal takes place.
There is, however, a facility to withdraw interest from the account without
invalidating the tax-free status. These withdrawals must not exceed the full
amount of interest credited to date, less basic-rate income tax.
The reasoning behind this is to place depositors in a similar position to
what they would have been had they placed their funds outside a Tessa and
received interest net of tax. When the five-year period has ended, the
balance of interest can be taken out without penalty.
As long as the depositor adheres to the relevant limits, there will be no
income tax to pay, even on the interest withdrawn. (Answer by Murray
Johnstone Personal Asset Management).

FT  23 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: What you should ask
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY BAILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is your account paying the highest rate? Not many people would turn down the
chance of receiving Pounds 1,000 for doing almost nothing - but such a boost
is available to Lloyds customers who have deposited Pounds 50,000 in the
bank's 90-day notice account. If they switched their money to the equivalent
account offered by National Counties building society, they would earn an
extra 2 per cent interest a year. But if a smaller, less familiar
institution has no attraction, how about the Woolwich? Even this building
society would pay Pounds 800 more than its high street rival.
How safe is the institution? While higher rates don't always mean higher
risk, they often can. Be wary of unfamiliar names. Some investors may prefer
to avoid smaller institutions, especially banks where there is a greater
risk of failure and loss.
Can I get compensation? Yes, but it is limited. The Deposit Protection
Scheme for banks will cover only 75 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000  -
in other words, a maximum of Pounds 15,000.
The protection scheme for building societies will guarantee to repay 90 per
cent of the first Pounds 20,000.
One way round this could be to spread your money between different
institutions.
Instant access or notice account? Higher rates tend to be paid on accounts
requiring the longest notice but this is not always the case. See if you can
strike a balance to find a rate which is both very competitive but also
instant access. Postal accounts are a good start.
Keep a regular check. Once you have tracked down the right account, you will
need to keep an eye on it. Today's thoroughbreds have a nasty habit of
becoming tomorrow's also-rans.

you need facts  / Where to find them
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Information is essential to managing your cash, just as it is for investing
in shares. Although putting cash on deposit should be the most
straightforward part of managing a portfolio, it is often difficult to know
where to locate the best rates. Here is a run-down of useful sources.
MoneyFacts
A monthly bulletin gives savings rates (including tax-exempt special savings
accounts, offshore accounts and accounts for businesses, charities and
clubs) from around 70 building societies and a range of banks, although the
smallest are excluded. In addition, there are details of current and student
accounts and National Savings.
The fixed-rate section includes local authority bonds, retail co-ops and
guaranteed income bonds. Borrowing also is covered, taking in credit, gold
and store cards, personal loans and mortgages from around 100 lenders.
The service is aimed primarily at the professional adviser, although one-off
copies of the magazine can be obtained for Pounds 4.25*. But information can
soon become stale in a monthly publication of this sort. For this reason, it
is being updated constantly on the main MoneyFacts database.
Three premium-rate lines give a lengthy summary of the latest rates:
0336-400 238 for savings, 0336-400 239 for mortgages, and 0336-400 237 for
commercial mortgages. You will need a fax machine to receive the
information. The cost is likely to be around Pounds 4 to Pounds 5, depending
on when you call.
Some information is available free on Channel 4's teletext service (pages
545-546).
MoneyFacts also provides the Weekend FT with its Highest Rates for Your
Money table - on page VII today.
Blay's Guides
These are another comprehensive source of information and also aimed at
professionals. Unlike MoneyFacts, you are given both gross and gross
compound annual rates. In addition, you can find out the net rates for both
25 and 40 per cent taxpayers.
You cannot buy an individual copy of the monthly paper-based Blay's
MoneyMaster but it is sometimes found in public reference libraries.
Alternatively, find out if your financial adviser subscribes to the more
sophisticated computer-based version of the service.
A fair amount of free information can be found on BBC2's Ceefax, pages
261-267.
Chase de Vere
This is a firm of independent financial advisers well-known for its
comprehensive guide to the personal equity plan market. In addition, it runs
a Moneyline service, which can take 200 to 300 calls on a quiet day. This
costs nothing and can be dialled via Freephone.
Savings details from all building societies and the large banks are updated
once a week. Inquirers will be sent a neat summary of the top-paying account
for different levels of investment, different notice periods, and for fixed
terms. There is also a summary of guaranteed income bonds.
The firm's subsidiary, London &amp; Country Mortgages, has a Freephone line
(0800-373 300) with mortgage information.
Which? Moneyfax
This is the newest of the services but, in many ways, is the least
impressive. Launched in June, it compresses too much on to one page: a range
of best-buy savings rates (including Tessas) along with details of credit
cards, mortgages, personal loans and overdrafts. Similar summaries can be
found in many newspapers and magazines.
By its nature, Moneyfax can be only a starting point for financial decisions
and it will cost you about Pounds 1 to get it - cheap, but not a best buy.
You will need a fax machine and the telephone line is premium rate.
FT Cityline
This provides a comprehensive mortgage service, updated daily, at a premium
rate. Again, you will need a fax machine. The 18 specialist lines include
one on fixed-rate re-mortgages and another on first-time buyer deals.
The cost could be Pounds 2 to Pounds 5 depending on the length of the fax.
You can get details of the different numbers to ring from the Cityline help
desk. A similar service for savings rates is being developed.
Individual institutions
Some organisations operate information lines, most with Freephone (0800)
numbers. But you will, of course, be given details only for in-house
products. Even so, savers often have their own reasons for choosing or
sticking with a particular organisation.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: In search of that certain mystique -
The Professionals / Joanna Slaughter continues her series on private client
investment managers. Today: Fleming
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOANNA SLAUGHTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Graham Ball, managing director of Fleming Private Asset Management, the
private client arm of the Fleming Group, believes that its flexibility makes
it different from much of the competition. Clients can choose the way their
money is managed and how they pay for it.
Ball says: 'Clients can be advisory or discretionary, fee-paying or
commission-paying, onshore or offshore, international or sterling-based. And
we take enormous pains to find the fund manager most suited to a new private
client.'
Last year, FPAM's funds under management on behalf of more than 3,600
private clients grew by Pounds 1bn to Pounds 2.7bn. Within its basic
portfolio management service, Pounds 396m is managed for discretionary
clients, and Pounds 596m is run on an advisory basis.
FPAM offers two private client services  - portfolio management for those
with Pounds 100,000-plus, and a highly personalised approach for those with
more than Pounds 1m who want an equity-based fund management service in a
major currency.
Given the house philosophy of choice and flexibility, it is no surprise to
learn that all clients have a bespoke portfolio. Unit trusts may be
recommended for exposure to smaller companies or to exotic markets, but
collective investment vehicles will not be used if the client demurs.
Ball dismisses those who argue that more modest clients should be steered
towards collective schemes. 'There is no doubt that a bespoke portfolio is
far sexier than a unit trust portfolio,' he says. 'And if clients have a
unit trust, they have to pay management fees. At the end of the day, we can
make a good profit with a bespoke portfolio of Pounds 100,000  - and so can
the client.'
The 40 private client investment managers have access to the independent
research and international capabilities of the Fleming group. It has an
in-house research unit of six, although the task of interpreting this
research for clients is left to individual fund managers. Their performance
is monitored regularly.
In the main, UK private clients will be invested in the top 250 shares.
Annual portfolio turnover averages 30 per cent. Ball says: 'What turns me on
in investment terms is good management, a good balance sheet and good
products.'
He adds: 'We are probably not ruthless enough with losses. At the end of the
day, we should put in stop losses. Some managers do, but we don't do enough
of it. I think the reason is the volatility of the markets.'
The house view on asset allocation is reviewed each month; indeed, FPAM has
recently taken 2 per out of the US and put 2 per cent into the Pacific rim.
The The present recommended allocations for a UK client are: cash, 2 per
cent; bonds, 0 per cent; UK equities, 67 per cent; US, 10 per cent; Japan, 6
per cent; Pacific, 6 per cent; Europe, 5 per cent; emerging markets, 2 per
cent; and commodities, 2 per cent. And although clients may have as much as
25 per cent of their portfolio in cash and gilts if prudence dictates,
FPAM's policy is to have portfolios invested fully.
Ball says: 'We think share prices are attractive at these levels. The view
we are taking is that the average p/e for 1995 will be 12 times. That is not
expensive; it is good value.'
Ball established a traded options team two years ago and says: 'With markets
so volatile, there is no doubt that derivatives are going to become more and
more important, and I think it is important to protect our portfolios. But
it is a learning curve. It is very important to hedge, but most private
clients do not do it properly. They will buy and sell options instead of
writing them.'
For the future, Ball would like FPAM to expand on the international side and
to acquire another stockbroker or investment house. But growth will not come
from advertising or promotions. 'Despite our success, Flemings are not known
for their private clients and that suits me,' says Ball. 'What we are
running is a quality operation. I want an air of mystique so people think it
is a privilege to be a client.'

FT  23 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Working to rule 535(2) - How to deal
in unquoted securities / Diary of a Private Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rule 535(2) sounded as if it might be part of a European Union regulation,
such as the one which defined a carrot as a fruit so that the Portuguese
could continue using these vegetables in the production of jam. In fact,
535(2) was not an EU regulation but a very useful rule of the London Stock
Exchange to facilitate dealings in certain unquoted securities.
Since July 18, when the stock exchange's new, re-numbered rule book came
into operation, rule 535(2) has become rule 4.2. But its general provisions
remain unchanged.
Shares in 236 companies are traded under Rule 4.2. These include the
Arsenal, Aston Villa, Everton and Glasgow Rangers football clubs; Adnams and
Shepherd Neame, which operate breweries and pubs; Lawrie Group, a tea and
coffee company; Exchem, which makes speciality chemicals, mining and quarry
supplies; and cereal-maker Weetabix.
In April, Michael Lawrence, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange,
launched a plan to 'promote the interests of both quoted and unquoted
smaller companies'. One of its suggestions was the 'development and
re-launch of the 4.2 trading facility as a distinct market with a suitable
level of regulation'.
I first bought shares in a 4.2 company in 1989 when a stockbroker
recommended Southern Newspapers. Based in Southampton, the company dominates
its regional market; its publications include an evening newspaper in the
Poole and Bournemouth area, where I live. I was happy to pay 325p as I felt
the company had a bright future, possibly through a take-over bid.
An unfortunate investment in Leading Leisure led to write-offs in Southern's
1990 accounts of more than Pounds 12m and a decline in its take-over
prospects; as a result, the shares drifted down. Undeterred, I took the
opportunity in 1992 to add to my holding at 225p. Southern's shares now are
worth more than Pounds 4 and the company is valued at well over Pounds 90m.
Pre-tax profits for the half-year to January 1 1994 were Pounds 7.15m,
although this included Pounds 3.5m from selling its shareholding in
Portsmouth &amp; Sunderland newspapers.
Several companies have moved from the 4.2 market to gain a full listing;
recent examples include Celltech, Independent Insurance Group, Scotia,
Tadpole Technology, The Telegraph newspaper group and Vardon, a leisure
concern. This means that some 4.2 companies - not all of which are big - can
be viewed as a ground-floor investment opportunity, the hope being that they
(and their share prices) will appreciate when full stock market listings
eventually are obtained.
Yet, many 4.2 companies do not want a full listing. Perhaps the directors
want to maintain their firm's local character. Or, they may want to ensure
they can act for its longer-term future without the publicity that can come
from a full listing. Some have been deterred by the cost of a USM or full
listing, plus complying with all the regulatory requirements.
Under Rule 4.2, a company need not pay a fee to have its shares traded.
Instead, a stock exchange member firm applies to deal in the shares of a
particular concern; if permission is given, this lasts for 12 months from
the date of the last trade. If dealings are so few that there are no trades
within a 12-month period, then a fresh application for permission must be
made.
Most of the dealings in this market are on a 'matched bargains' basis: a
seller is matched with a buyer and vice-versa. Details are reported to the
stock exchange and prices are published in its daily Official List as well
as on the dealings page in the Saturday edition of the Financial Times.
Some 4.2 companies actually are very private, and share dealings are
extremely limited. Without the 4.2 facility, shareholders may well be locked
into the company. Even with the rule, a share deal might not be possible for
months - if at all.
There are two reasons for this: first, because no one wants to buy at or
near the price offered; or, second, because there are not enough shares
available to satisfy every potential purchaser. Therefore, investors should
not rush into this market on a short-term basis. They could find themselves
with a holding that no one wants to buy for a long time.
On the positive side, interest in this market has increased greatly in the
past 18 months. In 1993, for instance, dealings worth Pounds 520m were
reported and this year should show an increase.
Direct investment in 4.2 companies can provide considerable tax incentives
for private investors. In its annual report, Southern Newspapers points out
that because its shares are not quoted on a recognised exchange, they 'prima
facie fall within section 105(i)(c) of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984 as a
relevant business property which, in appropriate circumstances, will rank
for a reduction of 50 per cent (30 per cent prior to March 10, 1992) in
value for inheritance tax purposes'.
In other words - and subject to certain conditions - if an investor owns
less than 25 per cent of an unquoted company, the IHT is reduced by 50 per
cent on such holdings.
It is encouraging to see interest being focused on this area - although one
hopes that the various tax incentives will continue to be protected.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Winners and losers - The relative
virtues of gilts and bond funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investing in a bond fund is, almost invariably, more expensive than buying
gilts directly. Gilts can be purchased cheaply and easily enough over a post
office counter from the National Savings Stock Register. But most UK bond
funds have an initial charge of up to 6 per cent (the table shows some of
the present bid-offer spreads - the difference between buying and selling
units). They also carry an annual charge, usually of about 1 per cent.
Gilt prices and yields vary in inverse proportion. While yields have risen,
from about 6 per cent to just over 8.5 per cent in the first six months of
the year, the price of the 10-year benchmark gilt - Treasury 6 3/4 per cent
2004 - fell 16.9 per cent.
Investors in UK bond funds, who hoped to have fared better, may be
disappointed to see from the table that the average unit trust in the UK
gilt and fixed income sector fell by virtually the same amount - 16.66 per
cent (offer to bid, no income re-invested) - over the same period.
This is despite the greater flexibility that bond funds have. Many of those
in the UK gilt and fixed income sector invest in shorter dated gilts,
corporate bonds and preference shares, which are part of a company's share
capital and pay a fixed dividend.
When yields are rising, as has happened in the first half of the year,
changes in price are greater for longer dated gilts than for those at the
short end of the market. The JP Morgan UK government bond price index, which
covers the performance of both longer and shorter dated bonds, fell 14.2 per
cent over the first six months of the year - less than the 10-year benchmark
gilt.
Bond funds investing in the short end of the market have had an advantage
over this period. The Whittingdale short dated fund does not invest in gilts
with a maturity of more than six years and the fund's performance has
benefited from this restriction. But when prices are rising, such as in the
bull market of 1993, the shorter end of the market tends to perform less
well.
Thus, the Whittingdale short dated fund was ranked 52 out of 58 by Micropal
in the year to January 3 1994 (offer to bid, net income re-invested),
although it was in the top five funds over five and 10 years.
Abbey Life's Capital Reserve fund (which is not included in the table
because it has only accumulation units) also invests in short dated gilts.
With net income re-invested, it is the top-performing fund (excluding bear
funds) in the sector, mainly because it switched to cash.
Gerard Wherity, its fund manager, says: 'We were nervous last year because
we thought that the rise in gilt prices was not sustainable.
'If we believe prices are going to fall, we avoid being in gilts. The fund
has been liquid through fairly large chunks of the year, but we were more
liquid than we should have been last year.'
Many private investors, however, buy gilts for the income they provide. The
highest yields of the top 10 funds listed were delivered by those investing
in preference shares - Gartmore Preference and Thornton UK Preference - with
over 9.17 and 8.5 per cent respectively.
Investors weighing the advantages and disadvantages of bond funds should
note that there is a tax drawback to buying gilts in a unit trust. Gains are
liable to capital gains tax, whereas gilts bought directly are exempt from
it.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIVIEN MACDONALD, The Inside Track
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Asprey, chairman of the famous London jeweller, made the largest
transaction of the week when he bought 375,000 shares on behalf of the
family's trust fund. But since the family already owns more than 50 per cent
of the group, the deal accounts for a very small proportion of its stake.
Orb Estates used to be called Ossory and had considerable success early in
the 1990s when its shares traded around 45p. Since then, it has made
substantial losses and, most recently, director William Higgins was able to
buy some stock for his pension fund for 1p. Earlier in the month Millash
Ltd, a company in which Higgins has a sizeable interest, bought 5m shares,
also at 1p.
The share price at Chrysalis Group, a music company, has had an
outperformance of more than 130 per cent against the market over the past 12
months. The company is expected to show a smaller loss this year than last
and record a profit in 1995. Non-executive director Charles Levison has
proved an astute investor already, buying stock at 68p last summer. In his
most recent transaction, he sold half his holding at 170p.
Directors at wallpaper-maker Osborne &amp; Little have also seen their share
price outperform the market over the past 12 months - in this case, by 189
per cent] Two directors have sold stock within the past month, most recently
chairman Peter Soar who disposed of 40,000 shares at 389.5p.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: The options option - Some advice for
stock market speculators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Speculators face a potential blow under rolling settlement, the new stock
exchange method of paying for shares (see page III). Under the old system of
account trading - which covered 10 to 15 per cent of stock market deals -
they could buy and sell shares for a quick profit without having to put up
any money or take physical possession of them. Now, each deal will have to
be settled - either in cash or share certificates delivered - 10 business
days later.
What, then, should the speculative investor do? He has two natural choices.
One is to engage in margin trading, borrowing money to buy shares. The other
 -to which Liffe, the London derivatives exchange, hopes investors will turn
 -is traded options. Like margin trading, buying traded options is a geared
investment: you make more money than you would in the underlying shares if
the share price moves in your favour - but you can lose everything if it
moves against you.
A buyer of a traded option has the right, but not the obligation, to buy or
sell particular shares at a fixed price at any time up to a specific expiry
date. Calls (the right to buy shares) and puts (the right to sell them) are
available in 70 different companies, with a range of different prices and
periods available for each.
Traded options relate mainly to FT-SE 100 companies and most are traded only
in blocks representing 1,000 shares. There are also traded options in the
FT-SE index itself. At the moment you can, for instance, buy Glaxo options
which expire this month (July), or in October or next January. The share
price is around 580p; available options give you the right to buy at, for
example, 550p or 600p.
Not unnaturally, you pay for this right. An option lasting until October,
and which gives you the right to buy at 600p, will cost 26 1/2 p - but one
for the same period, giving the right to buy at 550p, will cost 54p. If the
Glaxo price remains unchanged during that period, the 600p option will
expire worthless while the 550p one has intrinsic value of around 30p. But
if the share price slips to, say, 560p, that intrinsic value will be cut to
10p.
The point about traded options, however, is that you can buy and sell the
option itself - you do not need to use it to buy the underlying shares. So,
if the Glaxo price were to move up smartly, the options probably would rise
even more sharply and you could take your profits by selling the options.
Here is a real example of what might have happened. Say, earlier this
summer, an investor noticed that pharmaceuticals had underperformed the
broad London market and that Glaxo had done particularly badly. Indeed, on
June 27, Glaxo shares had underperformed the falling market by 13 percentage
points over the previous six months and stood at 533p.
One response could have been to buy 1,000 shares. In that case, Pounds
5,333, which could be earning interest in the building society, would have
been tied up. Alternatively, a January 500 call - that is, the right to buy
the shares up until January 1995 at 500p each - would have cost 63 1/2 p a
share, or about Pounds 635 (plus costs) for a contract.
The 63 1/2 p option price (known as a premium) is made up of two elements:
intrinsic value and time value. Intrinsic value is the amount by which the
option is below the underlying share price. (Not all options have intrinsic
value). Time value is the difference between the intrinsic value and the
actual cost of the option. Working it out involves a complex mathematical
formula but, essentially, the longer the option's period, the greater the
time value - because the chances of it acquiring intrinsic value in the
interim are greater.
The intrinsic value rises or falls with the value of the shares. But it
exaggerates the movements in the underlying share price. The time value does
not decrease in a straight line in proportion to the time involved. Often,
it remains relatively high until shortly before expiry, especially when the
market swings the way it has done recently. In fact, by Wednesday this week,
Glaxo shares had reached 584p and the price of Glaxo January 500 calls was
96p. An investor could have sold the Pounds 635 contract for Pounds 960.
The two main advantages of calls over shares is that (a) they are a geared
play offering the potential for much greater gains, and (b) the amount that
can be lost is limited to the cost of the option. Puts operate in the same
way as calls except that they allow investors to SELL shares at a fixed
price up until the expiry date. They allow investors to insure or hedge
against falls in the market.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Where to find the guidance you need
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Trading options is only for knowledgeable investors with deep pockets. The
problem is that in-depth information is not available as readily as that for
shares.
The London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe) has a help-line*
and will provide a starter pack that includes a newsletter, a list of about
50 brokers, a slim guide book, and a programme of seminars which costs
between Pounds 9 and Pounds 12. After that, however, you are out on your
own.
The next stage is to contact a broker although only about a dozen, such as
Killik &amp; Co., give advice on strategy. But Graeme Hatch, the head of
Killik's traded options team, warns that unlike share portfolios, which can
be left in the care of a broker, options are too risky to devolve. 'They are
far too volatile and speculative to leave to a broker, and people should
follow them closely,' he says.
For more confident investors, there are execution-only brokers which will
charge less but provide no specific advice. The most well-known is probably
ShareLink, of Birmingham. ShareLink will send out an information pack
similar to Liffe's and a regular newsletter. After that, it can tell a
client nothing more than the prices and the spreads.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Imperial Chemical Industries, the UK's biggest chemicals group, reports
second-quarter results on Thursday. Estimates range from Pounds 110m to
Pounds 130m against Pounds 96m. Most observers are bullish about prospects.
ICI is benefiting from its exposure to the buoyant US and Asian markets, and
the UK recovery. The only fly in the ointment is the European continent, but
US groups have even noted some upturn in demand there.
Reuters Holdings, the UK financial information and news group, will
emphasise its international and high-tech credentials on Wednesday by
presenting interim results in New York. The meeting will be transmitted live
by satellite to London, where analysts expect pre-tax profits of about
Pounds 245m for the six months to June 30, compared with Pounds 215m last
time.
BAT Industries, the UK-based tobacco and financial services group, is
expected on Wednesday to announce an increase in underlying interim profits
to about Pounds 900m before tax, although the range stretches from about
Pounds 880m to Pounds 920m. Last year's figure was Pounds 902m, but that
included a Pounds 123m exceptional profit from a brand swap deal with a US
company. Growth is thought to have been stronger in the second quarter,
driven mainly by insurance rather than tobacco. Lloyds is the first of the
British clearing banks to report its interim results (on Friday) although
the outlook is affected by uncertainty over its proposed Pounds 1.8bn
acquisition of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society. Pre-tax profits of
about Pounds 850m are expected although the figure is uncertain because it
will be affected heavily by how much the bank gains from releasing bad debt
provisions.
Interim results from Lloyds Abbey Life, the life insurance group, on
Wednesday are expected to show pre-tax profits of Pounds 164m to Pounds 176m
for the six months to June 30 (Pounds 152.5m). Interim dividend is expected
to be between 6.5p and 6.7p (6.3p). Acquisition of new life and pensions
business will have been difficult, especially given the emphasis put on
training the sales force. Growing vehicle sales and an exceptional gain on
the disposal of the Appleyard motor dealer group should lift interim pre-tax
profits at Lex Service, the UK's largest car distribution and leasing group,
to around Pounds 31m (Pounds 21.2m) under FRS3. Analysts expect underlying
profits of about Pounds 24m when the group reports on Tuesday.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: What you can expect to pay
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nominee account charges can be confusing. The most common charging method is
a fixed fee for each stock held, payable on a quarterly or half-yearly
basis. This often covers the whole nominee service, but sometimes there are
additional charges.
These cover such things as transferring shares into or out of the nominee
account, collecting dividends, preparing valuations or tax certificates,
passing on annual reports or other company documents, arranging attendance
at annual general meetings, or benefiting from shareholder perks. Holding
overseas shares in a nominee account is usually more expensive.
A few brokers make no charge for the nominee service - but make sure this is
not balanced by higher dealing costs or other charges. Users of
execution-only services are more likely to be charged for nominees than
discretionary or advisory clients, who usually pay higher charges elsewhere.
Some brokers reserve the right to make a charge for company reports or AGM
attendance, but do not necessarily impose it.
Many of the mass-market share dealing services take an all-in approach to
nominee charges. Barclays Stockbrokers has different nominee charges
depending on whether you are an execution-only or advisory client, but
provides the same pooled nominee service for both.
This includes half-yearly valuations, composite tax voucher, company reports
and accounts, most shareholder perks and voting rights.
Advisory clients pay Pounds 1 a stock each quarter (minimum Pounds 25) for
the full service; execution-only clients pay 75p a stock each quarter
(minimum Pounds 9) for the same service. Dealing charges are identical.
Fidelity Brokerage, which has about 25,000 execution-only customers,
registers all purchases automatically into a designated nominee account but
makes no charge for the nominee, which includes the full range of services.
The one exception is a Pounds 20 charge for re-registering shares into
another name. Leeds-based Broadbridge does not charge for nominee accounts,
and dealing charges are the same whether or not a nominee is used.
At the other end of the scale, the more exclusive Williams de Broe includes
a nominee service in the annual fee for its discretionary and advisory
portfolio management service, but execution-only clients are charged Pounds
3 a stock held in the nominee account each quarter, plus an extra Pounds 3
per dividend collected, Pounds 5 for tax certificates, and other charges for
transfers out of the nominee.
James Capel charges advisory clients Pounds 15 a stock each quarter for its
nominee package, in addition to a Pounds 250 annual administration charge
for each portfolio.
Most brokers have not yet altered their nominee charging structures in
response to rolling settlement but some, which until now have not charged
for nominee accounts, may start once larger numbers have opted for the
service.
One is Albert E. Sharp, which says: 'We do not charge advisory dealing
clients for nominee accounts, but are reviewing this policy and may decide
to do so in due course.' Before you sign up, it is worth asking any broker
how long the charging structure is due to be in place.
Dealing charges are sometimes different, depending on whether you are using
a nominee account as well as whether you are dealing on an execution-only,
advisory or discretionary basis.
Dealing with in-house nominee accounts is usually easier administratively
for the broker, so not using a nominee could make dealing more expensive.
Butterfield Securities charges non-nominee customers an extra Pounds 10 a
deal, and James Capel has a Pounds 25 'delivery fee' for non-nominee
advisory clients.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Brokers take the easy path - The
progress of rolling settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU and BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We are almost a week into rolling settlement, the new stock exchange system
for paying for shares - yet many brokers have not prepared for some of the
changes that are taking place. They have concentrated on encouraging clients
to move into nominee accounts, where the stock is registered in the name of
the broker's nominee company instead of the client himself. This makes
administration much easier for the broker, and some clients also prefer
having less paperwork to cope with.
Other issues - such as penalties for late payment and facilities for
allowing margin trading (lending money to clients to buy shares) - are
apparently being treated on a 'play-it-by-ear' basis. Indeed, one of the
20-odd brokers to whom we spoke suggested delaying this article for a month
 -by which time, he said, his firm hoped to have formulated its policy.
Nominee accounts
Ten-day settlement - also known as T+10 - is only the first step towards a
faster settlement process. The stock exchange intends to bring in five-day
rolling settlement next year. At the moment, a gap of 10 working days still
allows enough time for certificates to pass back and forth between broker
and client when the latter decides to deal. It is, however, difficult to see
how this will be possible under the shorter-time frame of T+5. Nominee
accounts are then likely to be the only way the majority of private clients
will be able to deal.
Nominee accounts are used already for all personal equity plan holdings.
Most brokers operate both pooled and designated nominee accounts. Pooled
nominees group together shareholders, and the only name that appears on the
register is that of the nominee company. In a designated nominee, the
broker's name and the client's designation - usually a number - appear
together on the company register and this should ensure that the investor
retains shareholder benefits.
Some brokers - including Broadbridge, Butterfield Securities, Dunbar, Boyle
&amp; Kingsley, Fidelity Brokerage, Fyshe Horton Finney, Killik, Sharemarket and
Shaw &amp; Co - operate designated nominees only (other than for Peps, which are
in pooled nominees).
Surprisingly, ShareLink, the execution-only dealing service, has not yet put
in place a nominee account for its dealing customers, although it says plans
are under way. It operates a pooled nominee for Pep and new issues
customers.
Penalties for late payment
Understandably, brokers are stressing the need for prompt payment. If, after
10 days, a client's cheque does not clear, the broker is left holding the
shares. Some brokers say they will charge the client interest - the figure
mentioned most often is 3 to 4 percentage points above the present base rate
of 5.25 per cent.
Others may also charge a fee. Shaw &amp; Co. says it reserves the right to
charge a late-delivery penalty of Pounds 5 a day on top of an interest rate
of 4 percentage points above the base rate. It warns that if stock remains
undelivered for 10 days, all costs and charges incurred will be debited to
the client's account.
Others have no penalties for late payment at the moment. James Capel said:
'We wait to see how the market deals with late payment and what recompense
we shall be seeking.'
Brewin Dolphin Bell Lawrie is waiting until September before bringing in
late-payment penalties; this will allow clients to get used to rolling
settlement. But it could charge up to 5 percentage points over the base rate
after that.
In general, execution-only brokers will charge higher penalties than
advisory brokers. Fidelity says it will charge 10 percentage points above
base rates while ShareLink could charge interest at 15 per cent APR and make
an administrative charge of up to Pounds 40, as well as selling the shares
involved and using the money raised to settle the amount owed.
The Tring-based Share Centre will not buy stock unless the client already
has enough money in his account to pay for it.
Is extended settlement possible?
Yes, although it is up to market-makers - dealers who set the price for
stocks - to accommodate brokers. Clients most likely to want extended
settlement are speculators.
Earlier this month Smith New Court, the securities house, said it would
accommodate brokers requesting special settlement after T+10. (Settlement is
the process by which shares are delivered to a buyer in exchange for
delivery of payment).
In other words, a client who wants to settle on T+11 might be able to do so
if he tells his broker when he places the order.
Brewin Dolphin Bell Lawrie says: 'Clients can request to deal for special
settlement. Any price differential will be a matter for the market-maker -
we will not charge extra for such a bargain.' Williams de Broe says it
expects to be able to improve on terms offered by others.
Sharemarket, the Manchester-based execution-only broker, is making extended
settlement a feature of its service. It will allow clients (at its
discretion) to roll over each 10-day settlement transaction for another 10
days, subject to certain terms. But other brokers such as Dunbar, Boyle &amp;
Kingsley and Albert E. Sharp say they will not allow extended settlement.
Margin trading
Most brokers say they are thinking about this, but few have come up with
concrete plans. Williams de Broe, Shaw &amp; Co., Butterfield and the Share
Centre are among those offering margin trading to selected clients.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Markets: A week of bread and circuses - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservatives delivered bread and circuses this week, their first double
act in a long time.
First came the Cabinet shuffle which elevated to party chairman Jeremy
Hanley, a man promising livelier leadership. He is well qualified. A son of
show-business parents and a one-time child screen star, he is known as a
good communicator and raconteur.
His first party political pronouncement came but a day later. The Labour
Party had elected Tony Blair leader 'for his looks, not his policies.'
Catchier quips could come later from the pen of Hanley's new deputy, Michael
Dobbs, a political novelist with the double-edged billing as a 'second
Jeffrey Archer'.
Then yesterday came the bread. Gross domestic product grew by 0.9 per cent
during the second quarter, its fastest rate since the recovery began in the
spring of 1992. Output is now 1.2 per cent above the pre-recession peak of
four years ago. News earlier in the week of favourable consumer spending and
government borrowing figures were butter and jam.
With a strengthening dollar helping to stabilise European bond markets,
gilts and equities savoured the good news. The FT-SE 100 index of the 100
largest UK companies rose four out of five days to end the week up a net
39.9 points at 3,114.7. The Footsie yesterday broke through the important
resistance level of 3,100 and held the high ground.
Many in the market gleaned a degree of confidence in calmer medium-term
trading from the comments of three central bankers. Alan Greenspan, of the
US Federal Reserve Bank, and Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England,
indicated that US and UK interest rates would have to rise later but not now
to check inflation. Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, left open the
possibility of German rate cuts later this year.
George, in the minutes of his June 8 meeting with Chancellor Clarke released
this week, indicated he was watching three main indicators of when price
pressures would demand a rate increase: the rate of monetary growth;
inflationary expectations; and cost increases particularly of labour.
Monetary growth is 'uncomfortably high' with the volume of cash and notes in
circulation running 8.1 per cent higher over the last three months than a
year earlier. The other two indicators are favourable.
But one other set of figures has been disquieting. Industrial raw material
prices are running at an annual rate of about 10 per cent while the
companies' output prices are only edging ahead at the general inflation
level of just over 2 per cent. Surely margins, profits and dividends must be
under pressure? If they are, how can the market be looking for further
growth in earnings to fuel the next rally?
S G Warburg Securities points out that profit margins were under equally
dramatic pressure in late 1992 and early 1993. Raw material prices rose as
sterling fell following departure from the ERM yet earnings per share rose
substantially last year.
One explanation is that raw materials are typically only a third of total
costs while labour costs, which have been much more subdued, account for a
far higher share. Moreover other costs, notably of money, have fallen
sharply.
Some sectors, such as paper and packaging, have enjoyed improved margins
thanks to better trading conditions as witnessed by the results of David S
Smith Holdings this week. Pre-tax profits for the year to April were up 56
per cent to Pounds 42.2m.
But the main story behind most margin improvements continues to be cost
reductions and corporate restructuring, Warburg argues. It forecasts further
widening of margins for the Footsie companies, as the chart shows. From a
recent low of 13.3 per cent in the financial year 1991-92, it estimates a
margin of 15.38 per cent this fiscal year and 15.8 per cent next year.
It identifies a mixed bunch of companies offering the best margin growth
next year relative to their average 1989-93 margins. They range from
newly-privatised utilities such as National Power (up 41 per cent) and
Eastern Electric (up 38 per cent) with plenty of scope to cut costs, to
corporate restructuring cases such as ICI (up 47 per cent) and British
Aerospace (up 233 per cent).
The worst performers are equally mixed. Mature utilities facing increasing
competition and the tightening of regulatory screws are among the weaker
stocks. British Telecommunications' 1995 margin is forecast to fall 13 per
cent from its 1989-93 average while British Gas's will drop 11 per cent.
Consumer stocks are some of the most adversely affected given the tough
pricing environment in which they operate. Food manufacturers and retailers
are particularly vulnerable. Shoprite, a Scottish discount grocer far too
small to be a Footsie stock on Warburg's list, testified to the trauma on
Thursday. Its second profits warning in two months halved its share price to
30p. It had peaked in February at 243p. It has cut its costs and stabilised
its margins but it cannot generate adequate turnover.
One Footsie retailer Warburg does identify is Argyll Group, the Safeway
supermarket chain. It forecasts Argyll's margin will be 8 per cent lower
next year than the group's five-year average. The trading news from Argyll
this week was more positive than that. Sir Alistair Grant, its chairman,
told the agm that first quarter like-for-like sales and pre-tax profits were
ahead of last year's. Similarly, Sir Christopher Benson, at Boots agm, could
speak of better sales in all divisions except DIY.
Shareholders at neither agm were happy. Complaints from them about the
impressive bread executives had made turned both meetings into a bit of a
circus.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Markets: Soaring earnings fail to impress investors - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
These are frustrating times for many publicly-quoted US companies. They have
done what Wall Street wanted: cut costs, revamped their operations and
management structures, adopted new business strategies and delivered strong
earnings growth. Yet, still the stock market is un-satisfied.
Take Intel, for example. Earlier this week, the computer chip manufacturer
announced second-quarter profits of Dollars 640m achieved on 30 per cent
revenue growth. Although it was the company's second consecutive record
quarter, and it was bang in line with analysts' forecasts, the performance
failed to impress investors, who sold Intel's share price down almost
Dollars 2 to Dollars 57.
Compaq suffered a similar fate. Its share price fell Dollars 1 3/4 to
Dollars 31 1/2 on Wednesday even though the computer group reported a 53 per
cent surge in second-quarter sales and earnings that were double the
previous year's at Dollars 210m.
Another victim of the seemingly capricious market was the California
software developer Sybase, which watched its share price plunge Dollars 8
3/4 , or 18 per cent, to Dollars 39 3/4 following the announcement of
second-quarter earnings that were sharply higher than a year ago and above
analysts' expectations.
The selling was not confined to computer companies. Aerospace group United
Technologies reported a 32 per cent increase in profits that matched all but
the most optimistic of forecasts - but its shares fell almost Dollars 4 to
Dollars 62 1/2 .
There were other examples this week of stocks falling in spite of strong
quarterly results but, in almost each instance, the reason for the
apparently surprising decline was the same: while the second-quarter looked
good, investors did not like what they saw ahead.
In Intel's case, it was concern about long-term demand for personal
computers that brought the stock down, while Compaq's shares fell because
investors believed that an increase in inventories during the second quarter
was a warning that sales were beginning to slow down. Sybase shares tumbled
because the market was worried about a possible easing off in the sales
growth of its core database products, and United Technologies suffered from
signs of moderate sales weakness in two of its divisions.
Admittedly, there is nothing new in this type of reaction - the most basic
theory of investing says that earnings news is always old news, and that
share prices should be driven more by expectations of future, not
announcements of past, performance. But investors seem to have been
especially harsh on stocks in this reporting season.
The most likely explanation is a broader underlying current of concern about
the economy as a whole. Although it has been growing more rapidly than
expected this year, most Wall Street analysts believe it will slow down in
the second half and beyond as the impact of higher interest rates begins to
bite. And if economic growth is about to slow, that means sales of
computers, cars, washing machines, and much more, are likely to do the same,
spelling bad news for US companies.
Yet, the fear that economic growth is going to slacken does not necessarily
have to be an entirely negative influence on share prices. The stock market
has had a difficult 1994, mostly because of the sharp, and unanticipated,
rise in long-term interest rates since early February. Rates have been
climbing steadily from historic lows because the bond market is worried that
the rapidly-expanding economy will lead to higher inflation.
If, however, economic growth is about to slow down, anxiety about inflation
should begin to ease, allowing interest rates to come down and share prices
to go up.
The bullish stock market forecasters on Wall Street who are predicting
modest, low-inflation economic growth and a second-half rally in stocks
substantial enough to push the Dow Jones Industrial Average over 4,000 for
the first time, certainly believe in this rosy scenario. The only problem
is, their confidence is not shared by the person that matters most - Federal
Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan.
Giving his semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins testimony before Congress this week,
Greenspan said he remained concerned about rising prices (particularly in
view of the recent decline in the dollar against the yen and D-mark), and
warned that further increases in short-term interest rates might be
required.
The warning was enough to knock almost a full point off the price of a
30-year Treasury bond and 20 points off the Dow. Greenspan's threat of
higher rates also is likely to keep a lid on share prices for the rest of
the summer, no matter how good quarterly earnings prove to be.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Markets: Advisers who want their cake up front - Serious
Money
</HEADLINE>

What is worrying about the life insurance industry is not just its faults
but its attitude. The most obvious faults are failure to train or check up
on sales staff.
Barclays and Nationwide are the two latest big names to be damned for bad
training of sales staff - the very problem that earlier caused Norwich Union
to pull all its salesmen off the streets and put them back in the classroom.
Lack of proper control systems was the sin at Legal and General and
Cornhill.
Bad, but not really that surprising: the criticisms merely confirm what the
public had suspected already. And perhaps the companies will repent and
amend their ways.
More disquieting is a recent survey by Sun Life asking independent financial
advisers what commission structure they would like in future - ie, when
disclosure becomes compulsory in January. It is hard to believe that the
public will continue happily to buy life insurance when they realise quite
how big the commission bite is, particularly at the start of a policy.
Outsiders had predicted that fear of the public reaction to disclosure would
prompt companies to spread commissions more evenly over the policy period.
Hence Sun Life's tentative survey suggestion that the advisers might like to
give customers a better deal by handing some or all of the customary
commission back - or, at least, spread it over a longer period. No dice.
More than 90 per cent of the independent advisers polled said they would
still like to get the same money, thank you. And more than half of that 90
per cent want to stick to the present system - whereby they get the vast
majority of their money at the time they clinch the sale - rather than
spreading commissions more evenly over the life of the policy.
Sun Life, for its part, disclaims any intention of trying to force a change
in commission structures. It reckons the decision is up to the advisers,
since they are the ones who will have to sell the policies. No worries about
what will happen if they fail. Impotence or complacency run mad?
'Quem Jupiter vult perdere, dementat prius.'
First catch your phoenix. Extraordinarily good fund managers, such as Warren
Buffett and Peter Lynch, do exist. But they are very rare and very hard to
identify without hindsight. So, why not abandon the futile search and settle
for something that is attainable - an index fund?
This is one of the main messages of a splendid American book called Bogle on
Mutual Funds*. (These are the US equivalent of unit trusts). And what is so
disarming about this particular messenger is that the author, John Bogle,
runs a Pounds 100bn mutual fund business called Vanguard, renowned for its
rock-bottom management fees.
Index funds, also known as tracker funds or passive investment funds, follow
a particular stock market index - such as the FT-SE-A All-Share index - by
investing in a bunch of shares selected statistically to mimic the index,
rather than beat it.
Mimicking the index sounds a distinctly wimpish ambition. Surely real fund
managers beat indexes - or die in the attempt?
The trouble is that most fail but soldier on. If you take account of costs,
only one in five funds beat the market, says Bogle. And ' . . . it is
certain that passive investment strategies have, will, and must, outperform
active investment strategies in the aggregate'.
So, why are index funds still in a minority? Three reasons. First, indexing
is counterintuitive: most people feel safer in a train with a driver.
Second, investment advisers and managers make less from index funds than
from actively managed funds; commissions and charges are lower. Third, hope
springs eternal. Fortunate investors brag about their success; others envy
and attempt to emulate.
If you are humble enough to settle for an index fund, which should you
choose? Even low charges make a slight dent in performance and mean that all
index funds are likely to do slightly worse than the index they mimic. But
go for the index fund with the lowest expense ratio, and never pick one with
a front-end charge, says Bogle.
The only UK tracker fund with no initial charge is Gartmore UK, which also
has an annual charge of only 0.5 per cent. It has a good and consistent
performance record.
The new issue market has flickered back into life. Both venture capital
group 3i and money broker Exco started trading at modest premiums - ie, the
price in the stock market after normal dealings started was more than the
launch price.
That should not encourage stags to come out of hibernation, though. Most
company sponsors aim for a modest premium. And both 3i and Exco were priced
when the market was groggy, so the pricing was not ambitious.
3i at least, always looked bound to appeal to large investing institutions,
while Exco has its own groupies. And, of course, the whole stock market has
picked up a bit recently. But that is no reason to say 'yes' to the next
tinpot outfit that passes the hat round.

John Robb, Wellcome's suave Scottish chairman and chief executive, claims he
is not overly concerned about his company's share price which has more than
halved since 1992.
'I've given up complaining about it,' he insisted unconvincingly on Thursday
as he explained the group's latest results. He then spent five minutes
lamenting that the company was undervalued.
Still, Robb should be pleased with the reaction to this week's results. In
March last year, when he announced a 33 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, he
watched his share price plummet 97p in two days. Since this week's
announcement of a 12 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 182m for the
four months to June 30, the shares actually climbed - up 19p to 634p.
The reasons for the shares' rise were not hard to fathom. Wellcome's
underlying sales growth was impressive given a difficult environment.
Sales of Zovirax, Wellcome's anti-herpes drug and the world's fourth
best-selling medicine, rose 17 per cent. Growth in the US was 27 per cent.
And European sales were up 9 per cent, in spite of price cuts in Italy and
France.
The question is whether Robb can sustain above-average growth. Even in the
short-term, 27 per cent Zovirax growth in the US is clearly unsustainable.
Robb said his objective was continued double-digit growth. The main threats
to that goal are all directed at Zovirax, by far and away his biggest
product.
The first threat is from SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American healthcare
group, which is in the process of rolling out Famvir, the first direct
competitor to Zovirax. The company has already launched it in the UK and is
about to challenge Zovirax in the US.
'Famvir doesn't keep me awake at 3 o'clock in the morning,' said Robb. Dr
David Barry, Wellcome's newly-appointed director of research, development
and medical, pointed to the details on Famvir's US package insert,
describing the effectiveness and risks associated with the drug.
Rather than Famvir, the biggest threat to Zovirax is its patent position.
Its patents in Germany have already expired, and those in the US and UK end
in 1997.
Robb admits he cannot duck this. But he has a defence strategy in place. The
first element is a joint-venture with Warner-Lambert, one of the most
powerful US non-prescription medicines groups, to market the product over
the counter. This should significantly extend Zovirax's product life,
generating additional revenues, admittedly at a lower margin than in the
prescription market.
In addition, this month, Wellcome filed the regulatory dossiers in 19
countries for Valtrex, a successor to Zovirax, which Robb claims is more
effective and just as safe.
Nevertheless, some analysts wonder whether the difference will be sufficient
for cost-conscious health organisations to pay significantly more for
Valtrex than an off-patent version of Zovirax.
If Robb wants an example of what can happen when a significant product's
patents expire, he need only look at the other main set of results in
pharmaceuticals this week.
SmithKline Beecham has been over-shadowed by a significant patent expiry for
years and in May, the US patents for Tagamet, SmithKline Beecham's biggest
drug last year, ceased to be protected from low-price generic competition.
As he announced his second quarter results on Tuesday, Jan Leschly, chief
executive, insisted the 9 per cent decline in Tagamet sales did not
represent the full impact of the expiry which had occurred only half way
through the period. It was far worse, he said.
The reason for such candour is that the pain from Leschly's patent expiry is
almost over. Instead, Leschly wants investors to concentrate on his newer
products - up 81 per cent year on year - and his Dollars 2.3bn acquisition
of Diversified Pharmaceutical Services.
As Robb fights to protect his herpes franchise, Leschly can look on with
some smugness. He has been through the experience awaiting his counterpart
at Wellcome.

FT  23 JUL 94 / An Old Lady with new battles to face: As the Bank of England
celebrates its tercentenary, John Plender considers its past links with the
finance of war and speculates on its future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Are central bankers a good thing? A simple enough question, you might think,
as the 300th birthday of the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street approaches.
Yet, from the beginning, when the Bank of England's charter was sealed on
July 27 1694, the debate has never failed to excite powerful passions.
Within a year, a pamphleteer was declaring that the competition provided by
this fledgling institution had 'almost crush'd several sorts of
Blood-suckers, mere Vermin, Usurers and Gripers, Goldsmiths, Tally-Jobbers,
Exchequer Brokers and Knavish Money-Scriveners, and Pawn-Brokers, with their
Twenty and Thirty per cent'.
Then, as the charter renewal of 1709 loomed, another polemicist busily
penned a tract entitled Some Considerations against the Continuance of the
Bank of England. At 300 years' distance we can safely say that he failed to
win the argument. And, of course, the concept of central banking, embracing
the goal of price stability and the role of lender of last resort to the
banking system, was unknown to people of the late 17th century.
In the 20th century the reputation of central bankers has waxed and waned -
or, more accurately, waned and waxed. The Bank of England's heyday was in
the four decades that preceded the first world war. Sterling was pre-eminent
in a monetary system pegged to gold and the City of London financed the
lion's share of world trade.
Then came Montagu Norman, whose autocratic reign as governor of the Bank
from 1920 to 1944 incorporated the ill-fated return to the gold standard and
the Depression.
It was Norman's financial orthodoxy, and his opposition to Keynesian demand
management in the 1930s, that gave central banking in Britain a bad name.
Elsewhere, central bankerly conservatism was attracting similar opprobrium.
Politicians sought to assert greater control over the dangerous and
misguided people who brought us the slump.
Murder] Rape] Ravishment] Ruin] was the caption on the celebrated Gillray
cartoon of the Old Lady being wooed by William Pitt for her money. Where
Pitt failed, the Labour chancellor Sir Stafford Cripps succeeded. In 1946
the Old Lady was not only raped, but subjected to the indignity of becoming
a nationalised industry.
Political economy has since experienced a mood swing. There is a new
orthodoxy, and it states that while central bankers have been bad,
politicians have been worse. Having taken over much of the central bankers'
job, they created a devastating inflation that destroyed savings, distorted
incentives and imposed a hidden tax on the people. And they have proved
incapable of maintaining a stable international exchange rate regime.
In the first 250 years of the Bank of England's existence, inflation was
largely associated with the financial stresses of war. Indeed, the Bank of
England's initial raison d'etre was to provide money for William of Orange's
battle against the French and to tidy up the mess of unfunded public debt
that remained after the three Anglo-Dutch wars.
War could always be financed on the basis that it was unlikely to go on for
ever. Investors in government debt assumed that any deficit in the
government's accounts would be temporary and would ultimately be made good.
The striking feature of the surge in the general price level that came after
1945 is that it was the first great peacetime inflation since the Bank came
into existence. The technique of deficit financing was applied to the huge
and very un-temporary apparatus of the modern welfare state.
In the absence of a gold standard, or any other anchor for the monetary
system, public sector deficits were not made good. They were monetised. In
the vernacular, the government paid its bills by borrowing from the banking
system, which is the modern equivalent of printing money. War Loan, the
undated, archetypal government IOU, lost most of its value. Investors were
swindled in a manner not seen since the Elizabethan period, as governments
provided monetary accommodation not only for their own deficits, but for
wage claims, oil shocks and the rest.
The result has been a relative revaluation of the central bankers'
reputation. At a time when other nationalised industries have been
privatised and downsized, more central banks have materialised in the global
public sector. Their number has risen from 59 in 1950 to 161 at the start of
this decade.
As Forrest Capie, Charles Goodhart and Norbert Schnadt put it in a monograph
for the Bank of England tercentenary, which has been shamelessly plundered
for parts of this article, 'when a new nation state seeks to establish
itself, the foundation of an independent central bank will be an early item
on the agenda, slightly below the design of the flag, but above the
establishment of a national airline'.
Meantime, the managers of established central banks have demanded, and in
some cases achieved, independence from government - this is the great new
economic nostrum of the day, for which officials at the Bank of England all
too understandably yearn. And in the extraordinary case of Italy, central
banking recently achieved its apotheosis. The head of the Banca d'Italia,
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, was elevated to the job of prime minister because no
politician was deemed sufficiently credible.
The paradox here is that central bankers are flattered by the choice of
comparison. They may be less corrupt than politicians. But their record, in
those activities where they have retained freedom from the politicians, is
at best patchy.
Many economists argue, for reasons that will be explored shortly, that
central bankers are a threat to the taxpayer's health and should be
dispensed with altogether. In practice, a place such as Hong Kong, where
people enjoy higher per capita incomes than in the UK, has rubbed along
remarkably well over the past four decades without the services of a formal
central bank.
So the question is not merely whether central banks are a good thing, but
whether they are so different from other commercial organisations that they
are entitled to their exalted and protected status; and, more fundamentally,
whether they are necessary at all.
The unique feature of the Bank of England, in 1694, was that it was the only
public bank in Europe with the power to issue notes. A unique feature of
central banks today is that they usually have a monopoly of the note issue.
Yet there are some theorists, most notably the late Friedrich Hayek, who
believe that the issuing task should be privatised and that all
commercialbanks should have the freedom to issue their own notes. The
anti-inflationary logic is the opposite of Gresham's law: good bank notes
that held their value would, in Hayek's view, drive out the bad notes from
banks that over-issued.
Scottish banks continue to issue their own notes, which are accepted in
English supermarkets if not in corner shops. Yet these are not quite what
Hayek envisaged: they are fully backed by cash deposits with the Bank of
England. The Old Lady actually prints notes and her officials in
Threadneedle Street solemnly put them in separate boxes marked Bank of
Scotland and Royal Bank of Scotland.
In Hayek's banking market, in contrast, everyone would have to make
judgments about individual banks' credit-worthiness. Since commercial banks'
reserves would no longer be pooled centrally, they would have to have more
liquid balance sheets and stand ready to convert notes and deposits into
real assets, such as gold.
The strength of the case for 'free banking', as the abolitionist cause is
known, is the poor performance of the existing monetary authorities in
delivering price and financial stability. The fact that the central bankers'
powers are centralised means that they are open to manipulation by
politicians for electoral ends, which introduces a bias towards inflation.
The human and financial resources that central banks pour into supervising
commercial banks appear to deliver precious little. Despite all the effort,
the English-speaking economies have experienced one banking crisis per
economic cycle since the mid-1970s, running from the property crash in 1974,
to the Third World debt disaster in 1982, to the property and junk bond
fiasco of the late 1980s, and the simultaneous Savings and Loans debacle.
Taxpayers have ended up footing a multi-billion dollar bill.
The free bankers argue, entirely plausibly, that the existence of the
central bank as the backstop of the system is a cause of this instability.
Commercial bankers are less risk-averse when they know there is a lender of
last resort. Depositors impose no constraint on bankers' activities if their
deposits are statutorily insured.
The snag with free banking is the assertion that it would lead to a more
stable system. Anyone who believes that knows nothing of the behavioural
pressures on bankers and will believe anything. History suggests that in
periods of free banking, instability was endemic and that the social costs
of banking panics were high.
This is because banking is a fundamentally unstable activity. Banks exist to
satisfy demands that financial markets cannot meet. Indeed, when the Bank of
England was founded, the organised markets were restricted to government
debt and the paper of a few chartered companies. Because bank loans are not
quoted, they are difficult to value and to turn into cash. Moreover, bankers
inevitably have less information about customers than the customers
themselves.
Yet the banks' deposits are for fixed amounts and can be withdrawn on a
first-come-first-served basis. Depositors are also short of detailed
information about the people to whom they have entrusted their money. It
thus takes only a niggling doubt on the part of depositors about adverse
changes in the value of a bank's assets to spark off a run.
It follows that banks are different from ordinary companies, and widespread
bank failures can lead to a vicious spiral of default and falling prices, as
in the US in the 1930s, when a third of all banks collapsed and the Federal
Reserve failed to prevent a savage deflation. So the risks in any experiment
in free banking are high.
There must be a possibility that in the first free banking panic money would
fly to the biggest and safest bank, which in the UK would probably end up
being called the Bank of England, if it was not the Bank of England already.
In other words, we might find ourselves going through the painful process of
rediscovering the convenience of central banking, while being occasionally
rebuffed in shops and pubs over our choice of notes.
This does not sound practical. Bigger and cruder threats to the central
bankers' status probably come from elsewhere. For a start, the bond markets'
power and prestige are in the ascendant. The flavour is well conveyed in The
Agenda, Bob Woodward's new book on the Clinton administration.
The sleuth of Watergate and the Washington Post writes, in a reference to
Democratic political consultant James Carville: 'That day the 30-year bond
rate dropped another 11 per cent. Carville was beginning to understand real
power. He told the Wall Street Journal: 'I used to think if there was
reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the president or the pope or a 400
baseball hitter. But now I want to come back as the bond market. You can
intimidate everybody'.'
The bond market is certainly more intimidating than Alan Greenspan of the US
Fed. In the face of quickening economic recovery and increasing inflationary
potential, bond yields started to rise as early as last October, while the
Fed waited until this February before tightening. And in Europe bond yields
have risen to levels that impose a swingeing penalty on countries such as
Spain and Italy, where budget deficits and the outstanding stock of
government debt are deemed unduly large.
Because long-term interest rates have a disproportionate influence on
economic activity in continental Europe, bond markets may even nip economic
recovery there in the bud. They have already put a damper on the British
housing market by forcing increases in the fixed rates of interest offered
to borrowers by building societies and banks.
In the new liberalised global market place, the central bankers' task is
thus double-edged. They must ask not only whether economies are overheating,
with inflationary consequences, but whether bond markets are overshooting to
the point of threatening serious deflation. Perhaps the bond market
over-reaction is the late 20th century equivalent of a free banking panic.
In the smaller and more open economies, however, the central bankers' room
for manoeuvre is somewhat curtailed. Sovereignty may still have a strong
national dimension for the Americans, the Germans and the Japanese, but for
most others - pace Britain's Euro-sceptics - it is overshadowed, in the
realm of monetary affairs, by the actions of the Big Three and the bond
markets.
All of which brings us to what, for the Bank of England, could render any
future anniversary a nugatory affair: European economic and monetary union.
This would deliver to the Old Lady a spurious form of independence from the
British government, while the remaining ability to influence monetary
affairs was transferred to a European central bank - rape, in fact, by any
other name, since the European bank's decisions will be made on the basis of
Europe-wide economic conditions, without much regard for domestic economic
shocks.
The good news is that the proposed European bank, unlike the Bank of
England, is not being set up to finance wars. The bad news is that the
relevant protocol of the Maastricht Treaty gives the new European central
banking system a greater degree of independence than any other central bank,
while offering less accountability to the European parliament than that
demanded of any other central bank. Even the notoriously independent
Bundesbank is required to account more seriously to the German parliament.
Such a transfer of power to foreign hands would not be without precedent in
Britain. After all, England's disaffection with James II and his alien
religion prompted the English to swap their flawed sovereign for William of
Orange. Yet the constitution of the proposed European central bank - pace
the Euro-enthusiasts - is a recipe to make the bond markets look tame. At
least William of Orange deigned to cross the Channel and submitted his
spending plans to parliament.
Admittedly, Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, argues that monetary union is
not on the agenda. James no doubt felt a similar insouciance on the eve of
his premature ejection from the throne. But it is hard to believe that a
hard core of European countries will not move towards monetary union. Will
the British establishment have the nerve to stay out? Will the Old Lady end
up running a sub-post office in the new European banking system?
This is no place to re-run the Maastricht debate. But for those who, like
the 18th century pamphleteer, wish to air Some Considerations against the
Continuance of the Bank of England, history has a lesson. If nothing else,
she is a durable old bird. Do not write off the quatercentenary yet.
An FT Bank of England survey will be published on July 27

FT  23 JUL 94 / The Long View: Throgmorton throes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week the London Stock Exchange gained a new chairman, John Kemp-Welch.
This week it made the switch to rolling settlement, initially over a
leisurely 10 days, which is more like strolling settlement, but next year in
five days and eventually just three. The venerable Throgmorton Street
institution, for over 200 years a pillar of the City of London, along with
the Lloyd's insurance market, is attempting to face the future: but does it
have one?
The latest changes tell us something about the pressures upon the exchange.
Rolling settlement is a response to the requirements of international
institutional investors, who like to trade on a standardised basis, in
roughly the American style. The interests of domestic private investors are
therefore being sidelined; speculators who have been accustomed to dealing
within the account are instantly inconvenienced and the general public will
find it hard to adjust to three-day settlement, when that eventually comes.
John Kemp-Welch's appointment is also significant. He has just retired as
joint senior partner of Cazenove, London's leading corporate broker.
Cazenove does have wealthy private clients, but it has been best known over
many years as a somewhat rough and tough promoter of the interests of its
many corporate clients.
Sir Antony Hornby, a former senior partner, declared after a controversial
1960s dawn raid for a client company that equality among investors was an
illusion. If someone decides more quickly, or has a better broker, this is
not unfair.
It is hard to imagine that in the past a leading light of such an
uncompromising if prestigious firm could have become chairman of the
exchange, when it was seeking to fulfil a broad public interest mandate. The
chairmen have tended instead to come from medium-sized firms, and from that
more modest base have been better able to pursue consensus policies.
But a different argument now seems to apply. Cazenove is the only big
independent firm which is fundamentally committed to the London market place
(apart, perhaps, from the market maker Smith New Court).
Most of the other main firms are parts of global investment banking
operations which can (and do) belong to markets all over the world. Without
Cazenove the London Stock Exchange would have an even bigger identity
crisis.
In its recent history, dominated by the consequences of the 'Big Bang'
changes of 1986, the London Stock Exchange has reflected the long-term
strengths and weaknesses of the City. Entrepreneurial and outward-looking
London-based firms have seized opportunities for the international trading
of equities and bonds that sleepier and domestically-oriented Continental
bourses have been slow to recognise.
Meanwhile the planning of the back office technology has often been poor,
leading to disaster in early 1993 when the expensive Taurus paperless
settlement system was abandoned. Responsibility for its replacement, the
simpler Crest, has been snatched away by the Bank of England; if settlement,
once a core activity, is to be controlled elsewhere, can any of the
exchange's activities, from price dissemination to control of listings, be
sacrosanct?
Originally, the Stock Exchange thought electronic settlement was all about
facilitating transactions, which of course is what its members make their
living from. But the key issues have turned out to be those of holding
rather than trading securities, and of maintaining contact between companies
and shareholders. Taurus could not cope with the complex issues involved.
The rather less ambitious Crest will force others to make some of the
choices. Crest could help drive a wedge between institutional and private
investors, for instance, because small shareholdings will not be included
except through nominee accounts. The latter, in turn, tend to drive a wedge
between companies and their small shareholders, unless the nominee
arrangements are carefully and expensively designed.
This underlines the possibility that the Stock Exchange will be torn between
the global firms (with their international clients) and the small companies
and private clients of the domestic market place. There are precedents in
the American markets, where the New York Stock Exchange lists the big
companies, and is increasingly seeking foreign company listings, while
thousands of small US companies are traded on the quite separate Nasdaq
system.
Certainly, the London Stock Exchange is a popular market. Hundreds of
companies have sought listings in the past year or two, admittedly at a
favourable time of the cycle.
To an extent, the market place will decide. Rival dealing systems are
beginning to nibble at the central market. The power of the big London
market makers, who were vastly profitable in last year's bull market, will
be one of the biggest challenges for John Kemp-Welch. Money talks, and they
have prospered mightily from the relatively opaque trading system, which
makes it fairly easy to trade their way out of large positions. Investors,
though, will tend to drift towards more transparent systems where they can
find them.
Once, a lot of the problems could be solved within the framework of an
effective monopoly over secondary share trading and a fixed commission
structure. The holes could be plugged through cross-subsidisation.
Fierce international competition requires awkward decisions to be made,
however. The exchange has already shed many of its activities, including
private investor support and the professional regulation of market
practitioners. The question, perhaps, is whether the viable core would still
merit the name London Stock Exchange. But unlike Lloyd's it has at least
retained its dignity.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Plutonium find adds to nuclear smuggling fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

The discovery in Germany of weapons grade plutonium, believed to have been
smuggled in from Russia, has increased fears of a potentially dangerous
proliferation of nuclear material emanating from the former Soviet
republics.
In Bonn, Mr Bernd Schmidbauer, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's aide with
responsibility for the intelligence services, described the discovery, the
first time such material has been found in the west, as 'dramatic'.
In the US, one of the country's leading nuclear proliferation experts, Dr
William Potter, a director of the Monterey Institute in California, warned
that the find could be just the 'tip of the iceberg' involving a growing
business in illegally traded Soviet nuclear material.
One leading US scientist who has investigated the material said last night:
'This discovery is extraordinarily significant. It represents a change from
the hypothetical to proof.'
A senior European Union official yesterday confirmed that scientists had
only recently established beyond doubt that six grammes of the nuclear
material seized by German police at the beginning of May - a tenth of the
total - was highly enriched plutonium-239. The material was seized in a raid
on a garage in Tengen in southern Germany, near the Swiss border.
Analysis of the material was finalised by scientists working for the
European Commission at the end of June, leading to a flurry of
behind-the-scenes diplomatic activity, straddling the US, western Europe and
Russia.
The case was discussed at a special meeting of US, Russian and European law
enforcement officials in Germany earlier this week. Last night, the Foreign
Office said it was 'following up' the case with the German authorities
through the British embassy in Bonn. In Moscow, a spokesman for the Russian
external intelligence service denied the material originated from Russia.
However, Mr Wilhelm Gmelin, director of the EU Commission's Euratom
Safeguards non-proliferation agency, said: 'The data we have suggest it is
highly probable the material was manufactured at a Russian military site.'
US scientists, who together with police and western intelligence agencies
have been monitoring the case, believe the material may have been smuggled
out of the Kurchatov Atomic Energy Research Institute in Moscow or from a
research site known as Sverdlovsk 44 in the Urals.
Although the quantity is far too small to produce a weapon, there now
appears to be growing suspicions that it could belong to one of several
consignments which have evaded export controls and are yet to be discovered.
The German investigation is understood to have discovered unconfirmed
intelligence that the seized material may have been on its way to Iraq.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Watchdog boosted as Halifax and Allied Dunbar join
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Halifax Building Society and Allied Dunbar - the last significant
organisations whose support for the Personal Investment Authority had been
in doubt - yesterday announced they would sign up for the new regulator.
The news is a boost for the PIA, which has been the subject of intense
controversy in the financial services industry. It began operations this
week, replacing the existing regulators in a move intended to improve
investor protection.
Despite the list of financial services companies which have expressed
opposition to aspects of the regulatory change over the past few months, the
move leaves Prudential Corporation, the UK's largest life insurer, as the
only large organisation to have insisted on its right to be regulated
directly by the Securities and Investments Board, the chief City watchdog.
Statements from Halifax and Allied Dunbar show they still have serious
doubts about the PIA's likely effectiveness, despite their applications to
join.
Mr Mike Blackburn, Halifax chief executive, said the debate about whether
the current system could deliver high standards of investor protection would
continue. 'For so long as it remains', however, the society believed that
the PIA would stand a better chance of reaching the necessary standards with
the support of Halifax.
Mr George Greener, chief executive of BAT's UK financial services
operations, which include Allied Dunbar and the other subsidiary Eagle Star,
said the companies were joining because there was more chance of influencing
it from within. While he still had grave concerns about the PIA, 'we are
where we are', he said.
While the PIA was careful yesterday to say only that it was treating the
applications like any others, it will have been relieved to receive them.
Had Halifax or Allied Dunbar followed Prudential's announcement of its
refusal to join the PIA in March, then the balance of the debate within the
industry could have turned against the new regulator.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Drug group 'quitting Italy for Germany'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Menarini, Italy's largest domestic drugs group, said yesterday it intended
to transfer all manufacturing from Italy to Germany, as a protest against
proposed government-imposed price cuts.
The company flamboyantly revealed its threat by taking full-page
advertisements in the Italian national press.
The disclosure was timed to coincide with a meeting of the Italian cabinet
to discuss additional healthcare reforms. These could include drug price
cuts of at least 6.5 per cent, although the health ministry is calling for a
10 per cent reduction.
'With this (proposed) price structure, the lowest in Europe, we have no
chance of remaining competitive in Italy and so we are going,' said Mr Lucia
Aleotti, managing director. 'I think other Italian companies will be forced
to close or move.'
Menarini said it was negotiating with Italian unions about possible
redundancies. The company employs nearly 3,000 people in Italy, and already
has production facilities in Germany as part of efforts to reduce dependency
on the Italian market. In 1992, it acquired Berlin Chemie, east Germany's
biggest drugs maker.
Trade unions were angered by the newspaper announcement, and promised a
national strike in protest. Union sources claimed the east German factory
bought by the company in 1992 was being under-utilised.
They recognised Italian pharmaceutical companies were being squeezed, but
felt the company was not giving the full reasons for switching production. A
consumers group threatened legal action against Menarini, demanding it
return subsidies.
Mr Aleotti blamed the decision on a series of healthcare reforms introduced
in January by the Italian government which is grappling with a huge public
sector deficit. The government plans to cut drugs spending from L13,000bn
(Pounds 5.4bn) in 1993 to L10,000bn this year.
The reforms were also introduced after a scandal involving payments to
government officials in exchange for certain drugs to be reimbursed by the
state. Charges of bribery were brought against Mr Alberto Aleotti,
Menarini's chief executive and chairman. He vigorously denied the
accusations.

FT  23 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: UK banks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Three influences look set to dominate the clearing bank interim results
season which kicks off with Lloyds Bank next week. Loan demand has stayed
weak and the turmoil in the bond markets has depressed trading income. Those
two factors will make for a lacklustre performance at the operating level.
But thanks to the accelerating economic recovery, provisions will have
fallen rapidly, perhaps on average by around a third from their collective
level of Pounds 2.4bn in the first half of last year.
That will ensure a bounce in earnings and a substantial improvement in
capital ratios. Even National Westminster could see its tier one ratio
rising above 6 per cent. The generally accepted assumption is that the banks
will use the opportunity to pay generous dividend increases. After all,
surplus capital is a burden if there is little balance sheet growth. It
might be better to pay some of it back rather than squander resources on a
price war that currently promises little by way of volume growth.
The dividend decision is a delicate one, just the same. While fears of
margin erosion due to price cutting are probably overdone for the present,
there will certainly be a fierce battle for market share once loan demand
does eventually pick up. History shows this tends to happen at a later stage
of recovery. Then banks will find their profits squeezed as they sacrifice
return for volume. It will be awkward if they have meanwhile set dividends
so high that retained earnings are insufficient to finance balance sheet
growth.

FT  23 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Stores
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UK retailers like to believe they are the best in the world. The market
clearly does not think the same. The mere threat of the US DIY chain, Home
Depot, opening stores in the UK has caused something of a panic this week.
It is easy to understand why. In its short history, Home Depot has been a
highly aggressive operator. Its execution of everyday low pricing leaves UK
imitators, such as B&amp;Q, trailing in its wake. As yet, the threat appears
remote; Home Depot will not quickly open stores across the country, but the
UK DIY market is precariously balanced.
If it did establish itself, Home Depot would throw grit into the main engine
of Kingfisher's growth. B&amp;Q accounts for about a quarter of its profits.
Ladbroke's Texas chain could also be badly squeezed. But Boots and W H
Smith, which together run the lacklustre Do It All chain, would appear to
have the biggest problem. There is a need for further rationalisation in the
mature industry even without Home Depot. There must be a suspicion that J.
Sainsbury, which runs the small but perfectly-formed Homebase chain, may
eventually be tempted to have a go.
Overseas entrants threaten to step up the competition in many other UK
retail sectors, providing another reason to believe that some domestic
retailers will struggle to grow. With consumer spending muted and inflation
low, that makes it all the harder to understand why so many stores groups
trade on the same multiples as they did back in their glory days.

FT  23 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: France
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The economic news emerging from France will keep business leaders happy on
their annual migration to the beach. May's strong industrial production
figures are evidence of a broadening and accelerating recovery. Mr Edmond
Alphandery, the economy minister, suggests French GDP growth might rise to 2
per cent this year compared with the government's previous forecast of 1.4
per cent. That is clearly good news for corporate France. The bounce in the
CAC 40 in July reflects as much.
But global investment flows will be just as critical for the direction of
the Paris bourse. Even though the UK and French economies have been out of
synch, it is significant that their stock markets have moved closely in
line, as the accompanying chart shows. Like the UK, worries about the pace
of recovery have unnerved international bond investors. With long bond
yields in France rising to 7.3 per cent and inflation falling to 1.5 per
cent, the economy may be squeezed again. The French room for manoeuvre on
short term rates has been stymied by the Bundesbank's latest moves.
Those high real interest rates may also point to a developing struggle for
capital between private and public sectors. With unemployment remaining
stubbornly high, the government's budget deficit can not be quickly cut.
Political uncertainty ahead of next year's presidential elections will add
an extra element of uncertainty. The French air traffic controllers' strike
 -disrupting the holiday migration - may presage unrest to come.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's clutch of data had the market purring again about the golden
scenario for the UK economy. Despite the widespread fears in anticipation of
the event, April's tax rises appear to have done little to check the
economy's progress. With year-on-year growth running at 3.3 per cent, total
output is now 1.2 per cent above its peak of four years ago. It still
appears that the output gap is narrowing only gradually. If so, that
suggests the UK is capable of a sustained spell of above-trend growth
without igniting inflation.
Such pleasant thoughts wafted the FT-SE 100 index 1.2 per cent higher this
week. Ever-improving prospects for earnings and dividends on the back of the
rebounding economy are continuing to drive equities. With a running yield of
4.3 per cent remaining less than 1 percentage point below base rates, the
market still appears relatively cheap. But, as ever, it will be gilts that
determine equities' ultimate fate. That is where the doubts arise. The
latest published musings of Eddie George and Kenneth Clarke suggest they are
ready to pre-empt the first whiff of inflation by raising short term rates.
Whether that calms or alarms the long end of the gilts market will be the
critical test of the stock market's nerve.
It would indeed be good news for equities if short term rates were to rise
and long rates subside later this year. A flatter yield curve would squeeze
consumer spending while encouraging investment. But the recent experience of
the US bond market suggests it would be dangerous to anticipate as much.

FT  23 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Corporate results fail to
spur Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices meandered in lacklustre trading yesterday as the heavy flow
of corporate results flooding into Wall Street this week eased, writes Frank
McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 2.59 firmer at 3,735.04, while the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was a scant 0.50 ahead at 453.11.
Volume on the Big Board was moderate, with 262m shares exchanged by the
close.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite edged 0.21 ahead to
433.45, while the Nasdaq composite added 1.64 to 716.67.
The Dow industrials opened modestly higher, but most stocks quickly
retreated to near their opening values and stagnated.
The narrow range in which share prices moved reflected an over-riding sense
of caution which has gripped the market since Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal
Reserve chairman, appeared before the senate banking committee on Wednesday.
His testimony caught the financial markets by surprise by suggesting an
imminent move to lift interest rates was likely.
In the second leg of Mr Greenspan's Humphery-Hawkins economic briefing
yesterday morning, the Fed chief delivered much the same message to the
House banking committee as he had given earlier in the week. With Mr
Greenspan saying nothing to calm investors' rekindled fear of a rate
increase, the market remained in a torpor.
The downward tilt paralleled the morning's action in bonds, where prices
softened in trad ing held to a minimum by the approach to a summer's
weekend. There was no fresh economic data on offer to influence sentiment.
But the session was not entirely without spark. Individual stocks rose and
fell with the release of the quarterly results of a few leading
corporations. Among the Dow Jones industrials, McDonald's dropped Dollars 2
to Dollars 26 1/4 on heavy volume of 4.8m shares. The downturn was a delayed
response to the fast-food chain's earnings announcement, which had elicited
a muted response the previous session. After digesting the figures, at least
two Wall Street securities houses - Merrill Lynch and Montgomery -
downgraded the issue.
On the positive side, USX-US Steel climbed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 37. The
group had released details of a strong second-quarter after the market
closed on Thursday.
In the computer sector, Apple Computer followed IBM's blockbuster results
with an impressive second-quarter performance of its own. The stock jumped
Dollars 3 to Dollars 31 as the company posted underly ing earnings of 50
cents a share, against a consensus forecast of 35 cents.
IBM, off Dollars 1 at Dollars 61 3/8 , was hurt by profit-taking, but many
technology stocks showed improvement. Storage Technology was marked up
Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 36 5/8 after publishing better-than-expected
results. However, Compaq Computer shed Dollars 1 to Dollars 30 5/8 .
Canada
Toronto eased in quiet midday trading with little news expected to jolt the
market out of its summer doldrums and Mr Alan Greenspan's comments on his
last day of congressional testimony having little impact.
The TSE 300 was 2.70 lower at 4,169.90 in moderate volume of 14.85m shares.
Declines outpaced advances 81 to 73, with 104 stocks steady.
Mexico
Mexican shares ended sharply higher as investors responded positively to
second quarter earnings by heavily-weighted Telefonos de Mexico, traders
said.
The IPC index of 37 top shares rose 67.85 points, a gain of 3.04 per cent,
to end at 2,
On Thursday Telmex reported net profit of 4.40bn pesos for the first half
compared with 4.43bn a year ago. Revenues were up to 13.84bn pesos from
12.34bn.
Despite the sharp advance in the index, turnover was an uninspired 59.8m
valued at 680.3m pesos.

FT  23 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Blue chip weakness
affects Nikkei
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tokyo
Selling of blue chip shares by corporate and overseas investors pushed
prices lower, and the Nikkei index lost ground in spite of buying by
individual investors, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 index fell 160.03 to 20,462.89 after a high of 20,673.53 in
early trading and a low of 20,427.29 in the afternoon. The index fell 1.5
per cent on the week.
The slight rebound of the dollar against the yen helped share prices in the
morning, but afternoon profit-taking and arbitrage selling depressed the
index.
Volume totaled 278m shares against 257m. The Topix index of all first
section stocks fell 14.12 to 1,637.86 while the Nikkei 300 lost 3.02, or 1
per cent to 296.53. Losers led gainers by 741 to 250, with 186 issues
remaining unchanged.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.24 to 1,325.97.
High-technology issues which have gained on the multi-media and
telecommunications themes fell. NEC fell Y10 to Y1,200 and Fujitsu declined
Y20 to Y1,050 while heavy electricals such as Hitachi lost Y10 to Y1,000.
Profit-taking hit large capital steels and shipbuilders. Nippon Steel fell
Y1 to Y339 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries declined Y9 to Y784.
Speculative issues were picked up by individual investors. Tomoegawa Paper,
which rose by its daily limit, climbed Y69 to Y635 and Kiyo Bank rose Y7 to
Y941 on rumours that a speculator was buying up the bank's shares.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 165.20 to 22,919.88 in volume of 33.2m
shares.
Roundup
Taipei lost most of its gains, Manila was strong and other markets drifted.
TAIPEI encountered heavy selling following Thursday's impressive rise. The
weighted index slid 81.10 to 6,496.60 as turnover rose to TDollars 126.17bn
from Thursday's TDollars 91.53bn. The market gained 1.4 per cent over the
week.
Financial sector stocks took the biggest losses: ICBC down TDollars 4.50 to
TDollars 88.50 and China Trust down TDollars 4 to TDollars 79. Plastics also
fell heavily: Taiwan Polypropylene, Grand Petrochemical and USI Far East all
falling by the daily 7 per cent limit to TDollars 68.50, TDollars 52 and
TDollars 47.50, respectively.
MANILA recorded its biggest one day rise in seven weeks assisted by strong
demand for Petron's initial public offering.
The composite index closed up 59.46 at 2,708.00, for a week's rise of nearly
4 per cent. Turnover advanced strongly to 1.44bn pesos.
HONG KONG was pushed higher by a round of late bargain hunting. The Hang
Seng index advanced 35.33 to 9,152.99, up 0.4 per cent over the week.
Turnover was HKDollars 2.55bn from Thursday's HKDollars 3.35bn.
Brokers noted that short-term positions had been taken on selected blue
chips such as Jardine Matheson, up HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 62.75. There was
also interest in defensive sectors such as utilities, with its sub-index
outperforming the overall market, rising 0.8 per cent to 10,552. HK Electric
rose 45 cents to HKDollars 23.45 and HK Telecom added 15 cents to HKDollars
15.
The banking sector was the only loser as investors remained unnerved by
worse than expected interim results from Bank of East Asia, which slid 60
cents to HKDollars 31.70.
SYDNEY rose slightly in subdued trade, and the All Ordinaries index put on
3.3 to 2,052.6, barely changed over the week.
Turnover was ADollars 368.7m.
Independent Holdings added 41 cents to ADollars 4.81 after Davids lifted its
takeover offer for the grocer by 55 cents to ADollars 4.80. IHL recommended
shareholders to accept the new bid.
Foodland, which holds an 18 per cent stake in Independent, fell 5 cents to
ADollars 4.85.
Meanwhile, Coles Myer and Rank Commercial said that they would drop their
bid for Foodland if their application for leave to appeal an injunction
stalling the offer failed
Coles Myer lost 1 cent to ADollars 4.29.
SEOUL rebounded from recent weakness and the composite index added 3.74 to
939.09, off 1 per cent across the week.

FT  23 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: Scenarios for the final leg of the bull
market - Strategic investment options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FITZGERALD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK-based pension fund managers had good reason to crow at the end of last
year. Their international asset allocation resulted in a performance which
was well ahead of the benchmark.
WM Company figures show that the average return earned in overseas equities
was 39.4 per cent, compared with the return of 25.3 per cent from the FT-A
World ex-UK. Underexposure to the US and overweight positions in continental
Europe were mainly responsible. More-than-double weightings in the smaller
Pacific Basin markets provided the icing on the cake.
Claims at the mid-year stage this year will be more muted. It is likely that
overseas equity portfolios are already trailing the FT-A benchmark by 5 or 6
percentage points. The big swing factor has been Japan.
The sterling return for the world ex-UK over the first six months of the
year was 1.7 per cent. However, this conceals the fact that nearly all
equity markets performed badly. Take Japan out of the index and the return
falls to -7.9 per cent.
The problem for most UK-based pension fund managers is that they were very
under-exposed to Japan at the start of the year. Worse still, their
relatively heavy weightings in the rest of the Pacific Basin will have
back-fired on them. Hong Kong and Malaysia, for example, returned -29.2 per
cent and -24.1 per cent respectively.
It is a time for a serious strategic re-think. Most equity markets have been
driven down this year as a result of the collapse in bond markets triggered
by the turn in US interest rates and mounting inflation concerns. It is
understandable that the US bond market should be the first to suffer
significantly given that the economy is more advanced than most in terms of
the current cycle.
It is also inevitable that a collapse in confidence in that market should
have a knock-on effect around the world. But quite why the knock-on effect
in the UK has been so severe is puzzling many economists and strategists.
Long gilt yields have risen by more than 2 percentage points at a time when,
if anything, consensus inflation forecasts are still edging down. And what
UK managers have to consider is whether this presents them with a good
opportunity partially to rebuild some domestic bond exposure or whether the
financial markets are signalling that bad news is just around the corner.
Certainly, the significance of this year's collapse in UK bonds should not
be under-estimated. The real, total return from long bonds up to the end of
last year averaged a remarkable 7.5 per cent a year. And despite a return of
 15.9 per cent in the first six months of 1994, long bonds have outperformed
equities so far in the 1990s.
These are powerful statistics to consider at a time when anomalous
opportunities in the UK bond market may be on offer. However, this is not to
advocate a wholesale switch from equities to bonds, merely to suggest that
it is an ideal time to reflect on portfolio efficiency. Indeed, our own
analysis suggests that a significant recovery in bond markets world-wide
would spark off a geared recovery in equity markets. And as far as equity
investment is concerned, the secret will be to identify which markets will
benefit from a combination of firm bond markets and good news on the
economic growth front.
That potential certainly exists in the UK. News on both the inflation and
growth front continues to better expectations. Solid growth in corporate
earnings and dividends will be achieved this year and next. Moreover,
institutional liquidity is very healthy. A recovery in the bond market is
undoubtedly needed if US equities are to make renewed headway. The
pre-requisites for that to occur are a stabilisation of the dollar and
further re-assurance that the strong economy does not present a significant
threat to inflation.
If, and when, that scenario unfolds, equity investors will be able to sit
back and enjoy what may be the final leg of the cyclical bull market. Our
projections for markets elsewhere suggest that UK pension fund managers are
highly unlikely to make up lost ground against the international benchmark
in the second half of the year.
Despite the good run in the first half, it is too early to be taking profits
in Japan.
Equally, we would argue that the pension funds' overweight exposure to
continental Europe could prove to be a drag on performance in the medium
term. Ratings in many markets are already discounting a sharp rebound in
earnings and there is a risk that investors will grow increasingly
impatient.
Of course, we could have it completely wrong. Perhaps bond markets are
correctly anticipating an inflation resurgence. And perhaps there is a
danger that corrective procedures will choke off the recovery. In which
case, all equity markets would still be vulnerable.
We think it unlikely. The fundamentals all point to further economic
recovery world-wide against a background of continued, low inflation. There
is every reason to remain fully invested.

FT  23 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris suffers a setback late
in the session
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With the exception of Paris the markets were generally stronger yesterday.
PARIS closed at the session low, with the fall occuring late in the day,
which also saw the end of the account. The CAC-40 index dipped 12.37 to
2,041.41, up 3.4 per cent on the week, having earlier reached a high of
2,074.
UBS Global Research commented yesterday that, after the good gains of the
last two weeks, investors would have to decide, with the start of the new
account, 'whether to buy the market for fundamentals after such a rapid
correction, or to wait'. They expected a period of relative stability, with
the index hovering around the 2,000 to 2,050 level.
Sanofi, down FFr1 at FFr975, attracted the attention of two brokers: Hoare
Govett and Nikko Europe, both reaffirming their buy ratings on the stock,
and the latter expecting earnings growth of 17 per cent in 1994 and 21 per
cent in 1995.
FRANKFURT enjoyed a comfortable end to the week, helped by some positive
news from the corporate sector.
The Dax index ended the official session 36.83 points ahead at 2,150.13, for
a week's gain of 2.7 per cent. In Ibis trade the market slipped back
slightly, closing at 2,148.23. Turnover was DM7.5bn.
The chemicals again did well, with Bayer, for instance, up DM6.70 at
DM362.70, up 6.7 per cent over the week, and in Ibis trade added a further
DM1.10. The company reported that it was on target for a rise in profits of
between 15 to 20 per cent for the year.
Daimler was another solid gainer, up DM19 at DM772, a day's gain of 2.5 per
cent and a week's of 3.3 per cent. The stock was helped by positive comments
from Mercedes.
Lufthansa added DM5.60 to DM201.50, off a session high of DM204.50, as
confidence in the airline was encouraged by a number of buy notes. Hoare
Govett, in one, argued that the group should see a return to profit in 1994,
thereby vindicating two years of aggressive cost-cutting.
ZURICH extended its rally to a fourth day, mirroring the stronger dollar and
still paying close attention to corporate reporters. The SMI index rose 18.4
to 2,597.8 for a 3.3 per cent advance over the week.
Nestle, whose better than expected figures on Tuesday sparked the market's
improved sentiment, picked up SFr9 to SFr1,179 while Sulzer put on SFr16 to
SFr921 on the view that Thursday's news on orders during the first half of
the year underlined the company's positive prospects.
Roche's recovery continued, the certificates rising another SFr60 to
SFr5,520 while Ciba picked up SFr24 to SFr781.
Insurers had a strong day, Winterthur registered rising SFr18 to SFr698 and
Zurich bearers advancing SFr23 to SFr1,350.
MILAN tried to put political worries aside, concentrating instead on the
improving economic outlook and the latest budget news.
The Comit index rose 10.34 to 730.45, for a 2.7 per cent rise over the week.
Volume picked up as domestic funds resumed buying, but foreign investors
remained wary.
Fiat rose L192 or 2.8 per cent to L7,051 as union leaders said that the
group was cutting the number of planned lay-offs by the end of the year
because of a pick-up in demand.
Olivetti rose L64 or 2.5 per cent to L2,586 and BCI, encountering renewed
foreign buying, advanced L175 or 3.7 per cent to L4,930.
Ciga gained L31 to L1,112, as the Consob market regulator announced that ITT
Sheraton, which holds 24 per cent of the hotel group, would have to make a
public offer to buy more shares.
AMSTERDAM resurfaced above the 400 level, the Aex index adding 3.98 or 1 per
cent to 403.02. However, trading was light ahead of the the weekend. The
market rose 2 per cent across the week.

FT  23 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Cadbury downgrade
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Soft drinks and confectionery group Cadbury Schweppes was weak again as
concerns over strategy were compounded by a downgrade by Lehman Brothers.
The US broking house lopped Pounds 21m from its 1994 estimate to Pounds
449m, and Pounds 60m from its following year forecast to Pounds 463m. One of
its key concerns is tough competition in the US soft drinks market where the
threat from private label suppliers has forced the market leaders to make
big price cuts. With such known names as Canada's Cott - one of North
America's biggest private label cola producers - moving into the UK, Lehman
believes a price war here is highly likely.
Cadbury also continued to be undermined by worries over its 25 per cent
stake in Dr Pepper, the US soft drinks group. Observers are growing
increasingly concerned that Cadbury will be unsuccessful in its attempts to
either gain board representation and greater co-operation, or a full
takeover. Cadbury shares slid 5 to 434p on moderate turnover of 2m.
Building materials stocks were in demand, with Credit Lyonnais Laing adding
its support as it recommended an 'overweight' stance. The broker said that
an increase in new housebuilding was stimulating materials demand and price
rises were being sustained in a variety of goods. BPB gained 10 to 343p,
Blue Circle 8 to 322p, Marley 11 to 166p, and Wolsely 13 to 823p.
Composite insurer Commercial Union tumbled 11 to 542p as the market
nervously awaited the much-heralded rights issue which is anticipated ahead
of the interim figures scheduled for August 10. Analysts believe the insurer
will bring its figures forward and announce them with a Pounds 325m cash
call, possibly as soon as next week.
Reuters Holdings continued under pressure from some heavy selling by one US
house, believed to be Goldman Sachs. The shares were down for much of the
day and closed only a penny firmer at 468p with turnover exceptionally high
at 10m shares.
Wellcome gained 29p at 634 after the market took stock of Thursday's
slightly confusing interim results, which had been prompted by a shift in
the pharmaceutical company's account year. On consideration investors
decided that the high exceptional charge and slowdown in Retrovir sales were
more than countered by the rise in overall profits and the pick-up in
Zovirax sales. The shares bounced 29 to 634p with the help of a couple of
broker recommendations.
ICI, the country's largest chemicals group, rose 19 to 837p as the market
grew increasingly optimistic over the prospects for second-quarter results
on Thursday. The shares were also buoyed by figures from German group Bayer
which predicted it would reach its target of a 15 to 20 per cent rise in
profits for the year.
Shell Transport shares approached their all-time high in response to hopes
of an early conclusion to the sale of its Billiton metals business. But the
stock moved back from its high on reports that the Nigerian oil workers
negotiations had reached deadlock and closed 6 better at 742p.
Bank stocks gained ground ahead of the interim reporting season which begins
next week. LLoyds, which is the first to report on July 29, rose 3 to 560p,
Abbey National, which declares on August 1, gained 9 to 408p and National
Westminster, which reports the following day rose 8 to 464p.
British Airways was said to have been helped by a recommendation from SG
Warburg. The shares climbed 4 to 435p.
Good UK car production figures stimulated rises in related stocks. Among
component suppliers, GKN gained 8 to 624p, Avon Rubber 10 to 600p, Laird 11
to 403p and T&amp;N 6 to 242p. Among distributors, Cowie added 5 to 282p, Lex
Service 5 to 464p and Inchcape 3 to 459p.
News from the US that DIY giant Home Depot had distanced itself from
entering the crowded UK market brought some respite to the beleaguered
sector. Kingfisher, under pressure following news that Home Depot had hired
a former B&amp;Q executive to spearhead its European expansion, rallied 8 to
509p. Texas owner Ladbroke gained 5 to 174p, while Do It All parents Boots
and WH Smith climbed 5 to 527p and steadied at 473p respectively.
Salibury-based brewer Gibbs Mew announced a Pounds 12.8m deal to buy nearly
200 pubs and a Pounds 13.6m two-for-three rights issue at 340p a share. The
company also announced a tripling of full-year profits to Pounds 3.1m. The
shares retreated 27 to 391p.
Granada was again under a cloud following this week's director's share sale,
the stock slipping a half-penny to 532p.
More bear stories circulating around Wembley saw the shares slump 3 to 7 1/2
p, although turnover was only 63,000. The company confirmed that it would
not pay a dividend on its convertible preference shares.

FT  23 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo hit by Zantac concerns
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bad news continued to dog Glaxo, the UK's leading pharmaceuticals group, as
the spectre of a long running legal suit returned to haunt it, sending the
shares into retreat. The news comes only a week after the market came to
terms with news of big losses in its Pounds 2.2bn investment portfolio.
The shares, which are also actively traded in New York, had performed
strongly in early London dealing as they responded to the rise in the
dollar.
Then in the afternoon the company announced it had issued patent
infringement proceedings against Novopharm, a Canadian generics company
which is attempting to get around Glaxo's US patent on Zantac, the
anti-ulcer treatment which is Glaxo's biggest selling drug. Glaxo is already
suing Ciba, which plans to sell a generic version of Zantac in the US in
1996. Within minutes Novopharm put out a statement saying that it was
counter-suing Glaxo for Dollars 300m.
There was a rush to sell the stock particularly in the US and after being 10
higher the shares ended the day 14 lower at 574p with turnover boosted to
5.5m shares.
As the market closed the story became even murkier with claims from some
analysts that a version of Zantac, known as Form 1, was already being sold
in New Zealand and Denmark. If true it would undermine Glaxo's claims that
Form 1 is innately unstable.

<TEXT>
Derivatives markets led the UK stock market ahead yesterday as firmness in
the US dollar strengthened confidence across markets in Europe, writes Terry
Byland. Trading volume in the September contract on the FT-SE 100 Index was
moderate, with a final total of 12,237 including deals conducted after
official hours. The contract remained at a good premium to cash throughout,
closing at 3,127, a premium of about 13 points. On Monday, the fair value
premium, calculated solely in terms of ex-dividend changes, comes down to
around 9 points.

FT  23 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Dollar firmness pushes Footsie above
3,100 - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK stock market was never in any doubt where it was going yesterday as
continued strength in the US dollar provided the upward impetus for markets
across Europe. The 3,100 mark on the FT-SE Index was brushed aside as soon
as trading commenced and only a weak opening to the new session on Wall
Street caused London to close below the best of the day.
At the close, the FT-SE Index was 19.6 up at 3,114.7. Comments from Mr Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, reaching London just at the
close, buttressed optimistic views of the outlook for the US dollar stocks.
There was no great response, however, to the estimates for second quarter
gross domestic product figures.
The FT-SE 250 Index gained a further 30 points to a closing level of
3,630.9, indicating that overseas demand for UK equities is spreading across
the full range of the market. Trading volume was high although slightly
below that of the previous session. Business in non-Footsie stocks increased
to around 57 per cent of the market total as investors looked for stocks
likely to benefit from a continued recovery in the UK economy.
The stock market was helped throughout by firmness in stock index futures,
where the September contract on the FT-SE 100 Index was still showing a
comfortable premium against the cash market at the close.
Over the week, the Footsie has gained around 1.3 per cent, with most of the
gain coming in the past two trading sessions as the US dollar has risen
vigorously in response to favourable comments from Mr Lawrence Summers, US
Treasury Under Secretary, and from Mr Alan Greenspan.
Most UK market analysts are now optimistic on the London stock market on the
basis of predicted growth in corporate earnings and dividends. A veiled
warning on interest rates, incorporated in the minutes of the June meeting
between the Governor of the Bank of England and the chancellor of the
exchequer, has done little to check near term optimism.
Seaq volume of 612.4m shares yesterday compared with 607.6m on Thursday when
retail, or customer, business of Pounds 1.26bn confirmed that business in
equities remains healthily profitable from the point of view of the
London-based securities industry.
The overall advance by dollar-orientated stocks was boosted by recovery in
several issues hardly handled in the previous session. Wellcome rebounded
smartly from the weakness which at first greeted the results on Thursday.
With analysts taking a generally positive view on prospects for sale of
Wellcome's anti-shingles and herpes treatment, the shares regained all and
more of the setback.
Stocks with home improvement interests recovered as fears of US competition
faded. Boots, Kingfisher and Ladbroke among the Footsie stocks all made firm
progress.
There was also a good showing among building materials groups on broker
recommendations and also among banks stocks ahead of the results season next
week. ICI was another to benefit from expectation of healthy results. With
the dollar's firmness rebuilding confidence on the near term outlook for
interest rates, stores and retail issues were also in better form.
Market strategists doubted whether longer term considerations on UK interest
rates would hold the sector back if investors perceived that economic
recovery in the UK would remain strong.
A powerful boost to the stock market and to the Footsie Index came from
strong demand for the oil shares, and in particular for Shell Transport
which continued to anticipate news on the planned sale of its South African
metals businesses.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Dollar rallies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar continued its rally on foreign exchanges yesterday, assisted by
an onslaught of verbal intervention from senior US administration officials,
writes Philip Gawith.
Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, again reiterated the virtues of a
stronger dollar, following similar comments earlier from Mr Lloyd Bentsen,
the US treasury secretary.
The markets took cheer from this shift in sentiment, and the dollar closed
in London at DM1.5955 against the D-Mark, well above its Thursday close of
DM1.576, but off the high for the day of DM1.6026.
Against the yen it finished at at Y98.72, down from the high for the day of
Y99.14.
Dealers said some of the dollar's retreat could be attributed to market
disappointment that Mr Greenspan had just repeated what he had said earlier
in the week.
The stronger dollar pushed the D-Mark lower in Europe against most
currencies. Against the lira it finished at L992.6 from L997.5 on Thursday.
Sterling also suffered at the hands of a stronger dollar, finishing at
Dollars 1.528 from Dollars 1.5375. The pound received some assistance from
the UK 2nd quarter GDP estimate of 0.9 per cent growth. This was higher than
the market forecast of 0.8 per cent.
In the absence of statistical releases, the market was left to ponder more
supportive talk for the dollar. After overnight comments from Mr Lloyd
Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, that he believed 'very strongly' in a
strong dollar, Mr Greenspan reiterated his view that a strong currency was
in the national interest.
Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London, said a
'180 degree policy reversal' from the administration had now been witnessed.
Until very recently, senior administration officials were explicit in their
opposition to higher rates.
Now Mr Bentsen and his deputy Mr Larry Summers are fulsome about the need
for a stronger dollar. But as Mr Hannah points out, this must mean that are
prepared to accede to the Fed tightening policy further.
Earlier this week Mr Greenspan indicated that a stronger dollar may be
necessary to reverse inflation expectations, and that he would be prepared
to raise rates further to achieve this.
Mr Hannah commented: 'They have given the green light to Mr Greenspan - if
you want to raise rates we will not stand in your way.'
Analysts remain more bullish about the dollar's prospects against the D-Mark
than against the yen. Japan's large current account surplus and US/Japan
trade frictions are seen as underpinning the yen.
German call money rose to 4.85/90 per cent from 4.75/4.85 per cent after the
Bundesbank's decision to set the next four repo tenders at 4.85 per cent,
compared to the current repo rate of 4.88 per cent.
The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 1.269bn assistance
after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 1.25bn. Overnight money traded
between 3 1/2 and 5 3/4 per cent.
Volumes in the futures market were low with the December eurosterling
contract trading only 11,670 lots to close unchanged at 93.91. The December
euromark contract traded 44,527 lots to finish at 95.01 from 95.09.

Demand for pepper improved further during the week and most suppliers
immediately increased their prices or even withdrew from the market, reports
Man Producten. Stock positions in consuming markets are now extremely low
and the availability of pepper in a most origin countries is also very
limited on the basis of the present price levels. Old crop stocks in hands
of holders in Malaysia and Brazil are held very tightly. Spot black pepper
is now quoted at about USDollars 1,900 a tonne and white at Dollars 3,100.
In the US market the spot black pepper price has reached the highest level
for some years a 92 cents a pound.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Week in the Markets: Coffee down but frost fears remain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London coffee traders were yesterday ensuring that they would not catch a
cold if there was another frost in Brazil over the weekend.
The selling that had driven the London Commodity Exchange's September
robusta futures price down by more than Dollars 350 a tonne dried up in
mid-week and yesterday's close of Dollars 3,640 was Dollars 170 off the low.
Traders had not changed their minds about the market, however; they still
thought a retracement justified after the recent spectacular surge to 8-year
highs. The main reason for the buying was determination not to have to
repeat the undignified scramble for cover that followed this year's second
damaging Brazilian frost two weeks ago.
No frost is predicted for this weekend, but traders were taking no chances.
'If there's no frost then we could see Dollars 50 on the downside next
week,' on told the Reuters news agency. 'But if there is frost it's going to
shoot up Dollars 500.'
Cocoa emerged from coffee's shadow at the LCE on Monday morning when the
September futures position jumped more than Pounds 40 to a 6 1/2 -year high
of Pounds 1,112 a tonne. The move above Pounds 1,000 attracted sellers,
however, as did subsequent forays. Only on Thursday did the price close
above that level and by yesterday's close it was back to Pounds 1,092, up
Pounds 24 overall.
Monday's move had been triggered three days earlier when New York cocoa
futures shot up in last minute trading. As with most commodity price surges
of late, investment fund buying was mainly responsible.
The bulls were not dismayed at their failure to break decisively through the
Dollars 1,000 barrier. 'The fundamental picture is of continuing deficit
with rising consumption, pointing to higher prices,' one trader told
Reuters. 'The market remains buoyant and we're seeing a consolidation
phase,' explained another.
At the London Metal Exchange copper's leap on Wednesday to a two-year high
failed to inspire the other base metals markets.
Once again it was to investment fund buying that the three months delivery
position's Dollars 77.50 rise was attributed. Dealers suggested that the
fund managers had tired of the palladium market, which they recently drove
to a five-year high, and decided to turn their attention to another metal
that would benefit from increased international economic activity.
The uptrend was not maintained, but the copper price did manage to
consolidate above the psychologically significant Dollars 2,500 level. It
closed yesterday at Dollars 2,514.50 a tonne, up Dollars 30.75 on the week
but Dollars 42.50 off the high.
In contrast to last week, when it reached a 39-month high and flirted with
overhead resistance at Dollars 1,550 a tonne for three months delivery, the
aluminium market ended this week testing support above Dollars 1,500 a
tonne.
The market seemed to take little comfort from a pledge by the leading
producing countries to maintain the voluntary agreement that is seeking to
cut world production by up to 2m tonnes for two years.
Delegates at a meeting in Canberra heard that Russia, while contributing to
the output cuts, albeit at a slower rate than it had agreed, was still
exporting as much as ever, and this can have done little to bolster
sentiment.
News yesterday of another big cut in LME warehouse stocks was ignored as the
aluminium price fell Dollars 22.50 to Dollars 1,510 a tonne, down Dollars
34.50 on the week.

FT  23 JUL 94 / International Company News: Westinghouse Electric income
slips to Dollars 75m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Westinghouse Electric, the struggling US conglomerate, yesterday reported a
fall in second-quarter net income, to Dollars 75m from Dollars 84m, for the
second quarter.
Revenues slipped from Dollars 2.15bn to Dollars 2.11bn.
Broadcasting, Thermo King, energy systems and WCI Communities were the only
divisions to improve their contributions to operating profits. Electronic
systems, government and environmental services, power generation, Knoll and
other businesses were all down.
Mr Mike Jordan, chairman and chief executive, said the results were slightly
above expectations. He said the company would accelerate its cost-reduction
programmes as part of continuing efforts to improve overall performance.
In May, he predicted that growth in earnings per share would reach 15 to 20
per cent over the next three years.
Operating profits fell to Dollars 154m from Dollars 185m in the ond quarter,
giving an operating profit margin of 7.3 per cent against 8.6 per cent last
time. Earnings per share fell to 16 cents from 20 cents. First-half net
income fell to Dollars 111m from Dollars 143m, before accounting changes.
Mr Jordan said employees had been reduced by 4 per cent - about 2,000 -
since the end of last December. 'These costs will continue to come down
significantly throughout 1994 and 1995,' he said.
Among the better-performing divisions, broadcasting lifted revenues by
Dollars 10m and operating profits by Dollars 8m. Thermo King revenues rose
Dollars 37m and operating profits Dollars 3m.
Westinghouse Communities, the property development side, lifted revenues by
Dollars 25m to Dollars 74m and operating profits by Dollars 11m to Dollars
24m.

FT  23 JUL 94 / International Company News: Eramet completes 15% share
placement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first step in the partial privatisation of French group Eramet, the
world's biggest producer of ferro-nickel and high-speed steels, has been
completed with the placing of 15 per cent with European investors, at FFr250
a share. This values Eramet at FFr3.7bn (Dollars 690.3m).
No new money was raised by Eramet, because the shares came from its three
French shareholders: ERAP, the state holding company; Elf Aquitaine, the oil
and gas group; and IMetal, the Paris-based industrial holding company.
Mr Rambaud said Eramet still wanted to offer at least another 10 per cent of
its shares, and to obtain a listing on the Paris bourse before the end of
this year.
Shares would again be provided by the three big shareholders. ERAP has
indicated, however, that it intends to retain majority control.

FT  23 JUL 94 / International Company News: Mercedes-Benz plans shake-up of
bus operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mercedes-Benz is planning a shake-up of its loss-making European bus
operations, involving job cuts and the merger of its interests into an
independent business unit.
The new operation brings together separate divisions in Mannheim and Turkey.
Kassbohrer will also be included if, as expected, Mercedes wins a takeover
bid for the struggling group. The new company is due to start operating on
January 1 next year.
According to Mr Helmut Werner, chairman of the Daimler-Benz vehicles
subsidiary, Mercedes will decide whether to make a bid for the Ulm-based
Kassbohrer business next week. Although Sweden's Volvo is believed to have
shown some belated interest in the group, best-known for the Setra marque,
Mercedes has been studying the feasibility of a takeover since April.
There have been rumblings of resistance from Mercedes' commercial vehicles
works in Mannheim. However, Mr Werner says the workers' council would not,
ultimately, obstruct the move, which would improve the long-term health of a
sector which had been losing money for years.
However, the cartel authorities could throw up obstacles to the deal, which
would give Mercedes a further 22 per cent of the German bus market, where it
already has a 35 per cent share.
According to Mr Werner, a structural clear-out was needed in an industry
plagued by over-capacity. The market was so tight that not all suppliers
could maintain production at economic levels.
At a closed meeting of the Mannheim workforce earlier this month, union
officials were reported to have said provisional plans to switch bus
manufacturing and fitting-out operations between the Mercedes and Kassbohrer
works could cost 2,000 of the 11,300 jobs in Mannheim.
Mercedes says a takeover would imply the loss of 400 bus-making jobs. Talks
are already under way on reducing the Mannheim workforce by 1,400,
regardless of the Kassbohrer project.

FT  23 JUL 94 / International Company News: Canal Plus, Bertelsmann in
pay-TV joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN, JUDY DEMPSEY and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Canal Plus, the French television company, and Bertelsmann, the German
publishing group, are to set up a joint venture aimed at tapping pay
television services throughout Europe.
The companies, which will invest more than DM700m (Dollars 446.9m) over the
next three years, will also specialise in digital technology, and create a
joint fund to buy programme and movie rights.
Canal Plus had a turnover of FFr8.7bn (Dollars 1.62bn) last year, and
Bertelsmann, one of Germany's largest private investors in television, had a
turnover of DM17bn.
The decision by Canal Plus to join forces with Bertelsmann comes at a
difficult time for the French company. It was rocked earlier this year by
the sudden resignation of Mr Andre Rousselet, its founder and chairman,
following a row with Havas, the French media group and one of its main
shareholders.
Mr Rousselet resigned after discovering that Havas had formed a coterie of
Canal Plus shareholders to effectively control the company.
He claimed it was a covert attempt to prevent Canal Plus from operating as
an independent entity.
This, he said, was because Canal Plus had been negotiating in the European
multimedia field with foreign partners such as Bertelsmann, in preference to
France Telecom, the state-controlled tele-communications group allied to
Havas.
Saint-Louis, the French sugar, paper and food group, is negotiating the
acquisition of an additional stake in Spanish sugar group General Azucarera,
Reuter reports from Paris.
Azucarera has annual sales of FFr1.5bn and is 10 per cent owned by Saint
Louis.
Saint Louis is under-stood to be seeking to acquire an additional 10 to 15
per cent of the Spanish group.

Mercedes-Benz expects to boost passenger car deliveries by 15 per cent this
year, regain lost ground in the US, and post a 'considerably improved'
result, according to Mr Helmut Werner, company chairman, writes Christopher
Parkes.
The Daimler-Benz automotive division, which lost a net DM1.2bn (Dollars
766m) last year, delivered 302,300 cars in the first six months of this year
 -an increase of 37 per cent, he said. Production rose 44 per cent.
The company did not have the capacity to increase deliveries further, Mr
Werner said. In any case, Mercedes was now planning capacity according to
medium-term demand. It was not interested in costly attempts to match
short-term trends.
Indicating progress in the group's restructuring and rationalisation
programme, Mr Werner said Mercedes would make 586,000 cars this year with a
workforce of 80,000. In 1991, a workforce of 100,000 built around 570,000
units.
Although progress would slow in the second half, the company now expected to
deliver 585,000 cars during the year, compared with initial estimates of
570,000.
Figures for the first six months were distorted by extraordinarily low sales
figures in the comparable part of 1993. These were blamed on recession and
customer delay in purchasing until the introduction of the new C-Class
compact Mercedes in mid-year.
The group was enjoying especial success in the US, where car sales had risen
28 per cent to 35,700 in the first half, and were expected to increase to
72,000 for the whole year. US volumes were now approaching those enjoyed in
the 'good years' of the 1980s, Mr Werner said. Meanwhile, both Mercedes and
BMW had increased market share, while their Japanese competitors had lost
ground, he said.
The commercial vehicles business was also improving, although the German
market remained sluggish. Total truck sales rose 12.7 per cent in the first
half, and deliveries of vans were up 18 per cent.
Overseas assembly and manufacturing subsidiaries were doing particularly
well.
Conditions in the German vehicles market were underlined in official
first-half statistics, released yesterday, showing total new car
registrations up just 0.8 per cent on last year. Truck and van sales were
down 2.5 per cent.

<TEXT>
Commerzbank is considering buying a bank in South Africa, with a view to
expanding its activities in the country, Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, chief
executive, said, Reuter reports from Frankfurt.
The bank is considering enlarging its financial involvement in South Africa
by up to 50 per cent, he said.
With an exposure of more that DM1.6bn (Dollars 1.02bn) in South Africa,
Commerzbank was already more heavily involved than Germany's other big
banks.
Its lending covers trade and sovereign loans, as well as project financing
in the steel, aluminium and power sectors.
Mr Kohlhaussen said the bank planned to establish an 'operating unit' in the
country, possibly before the end of this year. It would do this by either
buying a bank in which it would take over management, or by setting up a
branch or subsidiary.
He said there were several small banks on the market which could be bought
for between DM10m and DM20m.

FT  23 JUL 94 / International Company News: Apple's third quarter tops
market expectations

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Apple Computer yesterday reported higher-than-expected third-quarter
earnings, as sales of its new 'Power Macintosh' products introduced in March
advanced strongly.
Third-quarter revenues were Dollars 2.15bn, up 15 per cent on a year ago.
Net income for the quarter, before the effect of a one-time gain, was
Dollars 59.5m, or 50 cents a share. In the same period last year, Apple had
earnings of Dollars 10.6m, or 9 cents, before restructuring charges
totalling Dollars 320.9m.
Part of this charge was reversed in this year's third quarter, producing a
gain of Dollars 126.9m, or Dollars 78.7m after tax.
The company said it had modified and eliminated some of its original
restructuring plans due to lower-than-expected expenses and changing market
conditions. These plans had included moving certain operations to new
locations in the US.
Accounting for the effects of these items, net income for the quarter was
Dollars 138.1m, or Dollars 1.16 a share, compared with a net loss of Dollars
188.3m, or Dollars 1.63, in the third quarter a year ago.
Apple said it shipped more than 200,000 of its Power Macintosh personal
computers during the quarter, up from sales of 150,000 units in the second
quarter.
'We are pleased to see industry support building around the Power Macintosh.
More applications are arriving from software developers, and customer
response to this new industry platform has been very good,' said Mr Michael
Spindler, president and chief executive.
Increased sales of Power Macintosh, and the company's latest notebook
computers, helped to drive gross margins up significantly in the quarter, to
26.7 per cent of sales from 24.0 per cent in the previous quarter.
'Over the last quarter we have improved our financial model, controlled our
costs, and managed our working capital extremely well,' said Mr Spindler.
For the first nine months of 1994, Apple reported revenues of Dollars 6.7bn,
up from Dollars 5.8bn a year ago.
Net income after restructuring charges and reversals was Dollars 195.5m, or
Dollars 1.65 a share, for the nine months, compared with Dollars 83.9m, or
70 cents.

FT  23 JUL 94 / UK Company News: GKN helicopter compensation hopes rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Westland, the GKN subsidiary, has moved a step closer towards winning a cash
settlement from the Arab Organisation for Industrialisation over cancelled
orders for up to 250 helicopters.
The group's hopes were lifted after Mr Justice Colman, the commercial court
judge, granted an application by the helicopter manufacturer to extract
compensation from the AOI's UK-held bank accounts.
The move follows a 14-year battle between the AOI - representing the
governments of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates - and
Westland, the subject of a hostile takeover by GKN earlier this year.
Proceedings first began following the Camp David peace treaty in 1979, which
prompted the AOI to abandon plans to buy Westland helicopters built under
licence in Egypt. Lawyers acting for Westland have been seeking compensation
from the AOI since June last year, when it was awarded Pounds 385m damages
following arbitration proceedings in Geneva.
The group has so far recovered Pounds 25m from AOI accounts in the US and
Pounds 115m in France, leaving Pounds 245m plus interest outstanding. The
AOI is expected to appeal; GKN said it was exploring ways of reaching a
amicable settlement.

Its shares fell  3/4 p to 1 1/4 p.
The announcement comes just three days after the resignation of

The group said its bankers were reviewing the level of financing facilities

The results have been delayed pending a review of trading at Cygnet, a

FT  23 JUL 94 / UK Company News: From price war to bid battle? - The
likelihood of J Sainsbury entering a fight for control of Wm Low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A counter-bid next week by J Sainsbury to Tesco's agreed bid for Wm Low, the
Scottish supermarket group, is widely expected by the City, but some
analysts remain doubtful that the UK's biggest food retailer will enter the
fray.
Ever since Tesco, the UK number two, unveiled a recommended bid worth a
total of Pounds 200m for the Scottish chain nine days ago, speculation has
been rife about a bidding war.
Tesco's 225p a share bid values Wm Low at Pounds 154m, and it would assume
debt of just over Pounds 50m. Low's shares closed up 3p at 265p yesterday,
in the clear expectation that either Sainsbury would enter the game, or
Tesco would be forced to raise what is now being seen as a low offer.
Wm Low, which has 57 stores and 6 per cent of the Scottish market, confirmed
on Monday that it had responded to a request for information from Sainsbury.
Sainsbury might have been taking advantage of UK company regulations during
takeover bids to gain information about a competitor. But the City has
interpreted its silence this week as a sign it was weighing up a bid.
There are, however, two main reasons why Sainsbury might not make such a
move.
One is corporate culture. A hostile bid would be out of character for a
company that retains some of the ethos of a family business.
But while such a move might have been unthinkable for Lord Sainsbury of
Preston Candover, the patrician former chairman, many analysts believe Mr
David Sainsbury, his cousin and successor, would have few qualms - provided
he thought it made commercial sense.
That is the second, and more likely, reason why Sainsbury might hold back.
The group indicated strongly when announcing its results in May that the US
was the likely venue for expansion. Rumours have been circulating this week
that Sainsbury may be closer to making a US buy than previously thought, and
may wish to save its money.
Set against that are strong commercial arguments for expanding into Scotland
which, unlike much of England, is under-provided with superstores.
Only Argyll, whose Safeway and Presto chains have 16.6 per cent of the
Scottish market according to research group AGB, and Asda with 12.2 per
cent, have a significant presence. Co-operative societies have 8.9 per cent,
but small independent grocers dominate many areas.
Sainsbury, which has 4.6 per cent and until last year had only one
superstore in Scotland, has firm intentions to expand there. Its first
superstore in Edinburgh last year was one of its most successful openings in
years.
But expansion has been difficult. It has been outbid by Safeway for two
prime sites, and fought battles with Glasgow city council and Strathclyde
regional council over planning permission for others.
Buying Wm Low would be a quick way of more than doubling Sainsbury's
Scottish market share. The same logic, of course, attracted Tesco, which has
a 7.1 per cent market share in Scotland.
Analysts believe either group could enhance the performance of Wm Low stores
by cutting overheads and absorbing them into their business, and the
purchase could add about 5 per cent to their pre-tax profits.
Many believe Sainsbury has nothing to lose by bidding. Tesco's offer is seen
to price Wm Low cheaply, with Bell Lawrie White, the Scottish broker,
valuing its assets at 248p a share.
If Sainsbury were to be successful with a bid at 260p or 270p, the market
would still consider that a good price.
If Tesco responded by raising its bid to 290p or 300p, Sainsbury would have
the satisfaction of having forced its rival to pay an extra Pounds 60m.
Alternatively, Sainsbury could launch a 'knock-out' blow of 300p or more, to
try to ensure victory.
'I can't see the downside for them in bidding,' said one analyst. 'They
won't want to see Tesco get it on the cheap.'

FT  23 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Failed bid throws spotlight on dual roles
of Enterprise chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Graham Hearne is expected by the end of the year to surrender his role as
chief executive of Enterprise Oil, the independent oil company which earlier
this month failed to take over rival explorer Lasmo with a controversial
Pounds 1.6bn bid.
Institutions are thought to be keen to take the opportunity presented by the
failed bid to press Mr Hearne for an early division of his roles as chairman
and chief executive.
Mr Hearne, who is to retire in three years at 60 - the company's normal
retirement age - had previously indicated he would relinquish one of the
posts at some stage.
'If he had not tripped up he would have got away with it,' said one
investor. 'Having tripped up, it is another story.'
Institutions are also thought to be strongly advocating that an outsider
should fill the chief executive's post. This would appear to rule out Mr
Michael Pink, the former Shell executive who was appointed as Enterprise's
chief operating officer in May.
'It has to be an outsider to be meaningful,' said one institution. 'Everyone
inside the company owes too much to too many people to be really
independent.'
There was some speculation in the industry and the City that Mr Sam Laidlaw,
managing director of Amerada Hess, the US oil group, or Mr Lance Johnson of
Mobil Oil could be possible candidates.
Mr Laidlaw yesterday refused to comment. He said, however, that speculation
of an approach from Enterprise was 'without foundation'.
Mr Andrew Shilston, Enterprise's finance director, said the company had not
had discussions with anyone regarding the chief executive's post.

FT  23 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Warner Estate in deal with Merivale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER FRANKLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Warner Estate Holdings yesterday announced it was to take a 20.5 per cent
stake in fellow property company, Merivale Moore.
The shareholding will result from the issue by Merivale to Warner of 3.5m
new shares as part consideration for a Pounds 6m portfolio of commercial
properties, typically high street shops, being purchased by Merivale.
The shares will be priced at 90p apiece or a sum equal to 90 per cent of the
pro forma net asset value of Merivale at June 30, whichever is the lower.
The balance of the consideration will be payable in cash.
Merivale has suffered two years of losses, but returned to the black in the
half-year to end-December 1993 with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 133,000.
The company has been following a strategy of disposing of low or non-income
pro-ducing assets and concentrating on building investment income in higher
yielding industrial and retail investments.
In May this year it sold its remaining two office buildings at Vision Park,
Cambridge. This holding had dominated the portfolio, accounting for some 25
per cent by value while contributing just Pounds 250,000 of income in
1993-94.
Merivale now has a small exposure to property development and a limited
involvement in the residential sector.
Merivale shares closed up 11p to 71p. Warner's shares were unchanged at
243p.

FT  23 JUL 94 / UK Company News: TT makes agreed Pounds 16m offer for Dale
Electric
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dale Electric, the North Yorkshire-based generator manufacturer, has agreed
a Pounds 16m bid from TT Group, the acquisitive conglomerate.
TT's offer of 70 1/4 p a share cash is recommended by the directors headed
by Mr Iain Dale, chairman, who have accepted the terms for their 3.5 per
cent holding. TT already owns a further 3.5 per cent.
Mr Dale expressed sadness that the company was giving up its independence
after 59 years but said it needed to be part of a bigger group to survive in
increasingly competitive international markets. 'In the last 10 years we
have not been able to offer consistency of profits and the best way forward
for the business is from within another group.'
The company was founded in 1935 by Mr Dale's father Leonard, a milkman and
cinema projectionist. After enjoying strong growth in the 1970s, Dale was
hit hard by the recession in the early 1980s and more recently by the
downturn in aviation markets and unfavourable exchange rates.
Dale's results for the year to May 1, released yesterday, showed sales down
from Pounds 60.1m to Pounds 48m, of which half were exports, and a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 4.15m (Pounds 1.34m profits). This was struck after Pounds
3.44m of exceptional charges and Pounds 926,000 of interest.
The company returned to an operating profit in the second half but is not
paying a final dividend.
Mr John Newman, joint chief executive of TT, said he was happy that Dale's
finances had been 'cleaned up' and was confident that returns could be
improved rapidly. He could not comment on prospects for the group's 700
employees but said: 'Our intention is to grow the business.'
In 1987 Dale fought off a bid worth 136p a share from Sunleigh and the
shares reached a high of 147p in 1989. They closed at 61p, up 1p, yesterday
before the bid was announced.
As an alternative to cash TT is offering one of its shares for every five
Dale, valuing each at 70.2p.

FT  23 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Lower exceptionals cut deficit at Ascot
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lower exceptional costs and reduced finance charges enabled Ascot Holdings,
the property, pubs and hotels group formerly known as Control Securities, to
cut pre-tax losses from Pounds 79.6m, restated for FRS 3, to Pounds 6.88m in
the year to March 31.
Operating profits were Pounds 10.4m (Pounds 8.64m) including Pounds 2.43m
(Pounds 2.49m) from discontinued activities, giving a 29 per cent increase
on continuing operations. Net exceptional profits added Pounds 1.03m against
costs of Pounds 58.1m, which took into account a Pounds 53.4m deficit on the
revaluation of fixed assets. Net finance charges were Pounds 18m (Pounds
30m).
Mr Howard Dyer, chairman, said trading in the first two months of the
present year was on plan.
He added, however, that the company remained highly geared with negative net
assets although borrowings were cut over the year from Pounds 233.5m to
Pounds 141.4m. In addition, bondholders interest becomes payable from 1996
and the bank facilities remain on demand.
As a result the company is working on a financial restructuring. This
follows a restructure involving bondholders in June last year.
During the year there were 80 asset disposals as well as the sale of
Belhaven Brewery and Heywood Business Park.
Turnover was Pounds 77.9m (Pounds 80.1m) with Pounds 19.3m (Pounds 24m) from
discontinued activities. Continuing operations showed an increase of 4.4 per
cent.
Losses per share were 2.1p (21.8p).

FT  23 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Jupiter fund management move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jupiter Tyndall, the international fund management group, yesterday
announced its widely-expected acquisition of Queen Anne's Gate Asset
Management in a deal valued up to Pounds 10m cash.
Mr Charles Crowther and Mr Peter Adderson, directors of QAGAM, will become
directors of Jupiter.
QAGAM is the former fund management arm of the now-privatised water
companies; it has roughly Pounds 2bn in pension fund assets under
management.
In the year to March 31 it achieved profits of Pounds 300,000 and had net
assets of Pounds 800,000.
Although QAGAM has had above-average performance, it has only a few - but
very large - clients. Even the loss of one or two could have a significant
negative effect on profits and it has been seeking a buyer for several
months.
Jupiter's move is in line with its stated strategy of disposing of banking
businesses to concentrate on expanding fund management activities.

FT  23 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Gibbs Mew expands estate with Pounds 12.8m
Centric buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gibbs Mew, the Salisbury-based regional brewer, yesterday accompanied
sharply increased annual profits with the Pounds 12.8m acquisition of
Centric, the Midlands pub group.
The all-paper transaction, involving the issue of up to 3.21m ordinary
shares at 400p, will bring an additional 197 pubs into the group's estate,
taking the total to 318.
The move follows six months of talks with Centric, which was only formed in
1992 when it purchased 173 pubs from Bass.
Mr Tom Hedderson, chairman, said the deal would enable the USM-quoted group
to develop three core areas: brewing of traditional ales such as The
Bishop's Tipple; warehouse distribution and estate management.
'We have no ambition to be a mega-brewer, but this acquisition will allow us
to continue with steady and comfortable growth,' he added.
Gibbs Mew also moved to strengthen its balance sheet by announcing a Pounds
13.6m rights issue, which will be used to reduce borrowing. Gearing is
expected to fall from 65 per cent to 50 per cent - equivalent to pro forma
net borrowings of Pounds 20.4m - following the issue, in which existing
shareholders will be offered 4.28m ordinary shares at 340p. The shares fell
27p to 391p yesterday.
The issue, underwritten by Samuel Montagu with Panmure Gordon as brokers, is
being made on a 2-for-3 basis.
Once the acquisition and rights issue have been completed, the holding of
the Gibbs family and current directors is expected to fall from 64 per cent
to 35 per cent, while the shares issued to Centric will represent 23.1 per
cent of the enlarged capital.
Steady volumes in Gibbs Mew's west of England heartland and a full year's
contribution from UK D, the wholesaling operation, helped pre-tax profits
jump to Pounds 3.06m (Pounds 1.04m restated for FRS 3) in the year to April
2.
The figures were flattered by lower interest charges and a Pounds 363,000
(Pounds 154,000) profit on the disposal on surplus properties.
Nevertheless, Mr Hedderson claimed that operating profits of Pounds 3.74m
(Pounds 2.7m) on increased turnover of Pounds 33.9m (Pounds 28.7m) showed
that the brewer had defied a 2.5 per cent decline in national beer volumes.
Earnings per share rose from a restated 15.33p to 33.51p and a final
dividend of 5p makes a total of 8.75p (7.5p).
Centric, meanwhile, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 55,000 in the year to
March 26, against losses of Pounds 1.18m. Before interest payments on bank
and brewery loans, however, it made operating profits of Pounds 3.94m
(Pounds 2.76m).

FT  23 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Novopharm sues Glaxo in dispute over drug
formula
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glaxo, Europe's biggest drugs company, was sued yesterday for Dollars 300m
(Pounds 194m) in potential lost sales and punitive damages by Novopharm, a
Canadian company. Glaxo shares fell 14p to 574p.
Novopharm's action was an immediate response to a Glaxo suit alleging patent
infringement by the Canadian company.
At stake are the Dollars 1.9bn a year US sales of the world's biggest
selling drug, Glaxo's ulcer treatment, Zantac.
The dispute centres on the fact that Zantac is protected by two patents, one
that expires in the US at the end of 1995 and the other in 2002.
The two patents refer to slightly different forms of Zantac's active
ingredient, forms one and two. The Zantac Glaxo sells is based on form two.
Novopharm wants to sell form one after 1995, but Glaxo says that the
Novopharm product infringes form two patents.
By taking patent action under US law, Glaxo will delay the launch of
Novopharm's drug by 30 months, well past the expiry of the form one patent.
This would have the effect of extending the period during which Zantac is
protected from competition and led yesterday to the statement by Mr Leslie
Dan, Novopharm's chief executive, that 'the action by Glaxo is totally
frivolous'.
Novopharm's countersuit 'claims huge damages based on any potential loss of
sales if the product is delayed in its marketing beyond December 1995,' said
Mr Dan.
Glaxo said that the countersuit 'was not unexpected' and reiterated its
belief that it had a good case.
Two months ago, Glaxo took similar patent action against a subsidiary of
Ciba, the Swiss drugs company which, like Novopharm, said it wanted to sell
form one from 1996. Ciba did not counter sue.
Glaxo added yesterday that it had 'discovered' that form one tablets were on
sale in Denmark and New Zealand where the patents protecting Zantac are
weaker. It is studying samples and looking for ways to invoke patent laws.
It said it continued to believe that it was not possible yet to make form
one without infringing form two patents.

FT  23 JUL 94 / UK Company News: UK Safety shares fall on warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A profits warning from UK Safety Group, the Bristol-based specialist shoe
maker, knocked 14p off the share price yesterday which closed at 51p.
Mr John Newman, finance director, said full-year results would fall short of
market expectations.
Operating margins were under pressure in a highly competitive market and the
price of leather had also been rising steadily.
The volume of Ministry of Defence sales, which make up 16 per cent of
turnover, were down although despatch levels to the MoD in the second half
were closer to plan.
But, he said, the company's manufacturing and selling organisations had been
res-tructured to cut operating costs.
UK Safety came to the market in May last year through the reverse takeover
of TSW, the former independent television contractor for the south-west of
England.
In March it reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.6m for the year to
end-December.
The results included the trading activities of the Bristol company for the
eight months following the reverse take-over.
The company is due to report interim results in early September.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Lessons learnt the hard way: Robert Graham seeks
explanations for Berlusconi's political troubles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This has been the week that Silvio Berlusconi lost his political virginity.
For a man who has spent more than 35 years as a businessman and less than
six months as a politician, it was always a possibility that the Italian
prime minister's political inexperience would trip him up. But few imagined
Mr Berlusconi could commit such elementary errors.
Trying to hurry through a clumsy reform of Italy's system of preventive
detention, he brought his right-wing coalition government close to collapse
as alliance partners disowned his actions. The situation was only saved by
the withdrawal of the legislation at the expense of humiliating Mr
Berlusconi.
'The question now is whether Berlusconi can learn from his mistakes and put
the incident behind him,' observed one of his supporters, who has been
dismayed by the prime minister's recent performance. 'His image and his
self-confidence have taken a beating: but we can't tell yet whether he has
been permanently knocked off-course.'
Ironically, television, the medium which launched Mr Berlusconi, has become
the instrument of his embarrassment. A man who can establish himself with
extraordinary success in the public eye as a charmer and a winner, looks
vulnerable when the smile disappears and political setbacks take their toll.
Television viewers have seen Mr Berlusconi oscillate between hurt pride,
grim frustration and cold fury. He was even close to threatening his
resignation in a nationwide television broadcast on Tuesday. The TV cameras
were summoned to the prime minister's office but stood down at the last
moment when Mr Umberto Bossi, the astute leader of the populist Northern
League, promised to pull his party out of the coalition government if the
broadcast went ahead.
Yesterday, in a calmer mood, Mr Berlusconi admitted he suffered from
possessing too much self-confidence, hinting that an element of hubris had
set in.
But almost in the same breath he was talking revenge: 'As of Monday, I'll be
telling Italians the real story . . . You'll then see this affair will
boomerang for many people.'
The warning seemed addressed not merely to the League, which shamelessly
reneged on its cabinet endorsement of the preventive detention decree to
enfeeble Mr Berlusconi. It was also aimed at the press which this week
sensed the prime minister's weakness and turned hostile after giving him a
two-month honeymoon.
So far no one - neither Mr Berlusconi, his entourage, his coalition partners
or his opponents - has come up with an adequate explanation for the prime
minister's awkward behaviour.
After being in government only two months it seems improbable that Mr
Berlusconi should have been in such a hurry to tackle the judiciary's abuses
of their powers of arrest and imprisonment. It is also hard to understand
how someone so sensitive to public opinion would approve a decree that
allowed out of prison businessmen and politicians who have become figures of
hate for their involvement in large-scale corrupt practices.
Maybe the cabinet was unaware of these consequences and Mr Berlusconi
focused on correcting the genuine excesses of the magistrates who have used
imprisonment to extract confessions. Critics suggest Mr Berlusconi may have
been concerned to protect his own Fininvest media empire from closer
judicial inspection - though he would dismiss such claims as groundless.
Yesterday advance extracts from two weekly magazines, L'Espresso and
Panorama, suggested the Milan magistrates who resigned in protest over the
decree were investigating the links between a member of the Guardia di
Finanza (the financial police) arrested in April on corruption charges, and
Fininvest's tax department.
But even an element of self-interest does not fully explain an action which
has caused Mr Berlusconi such discomfort. Part of his self-inflicted damage
undoubtedly came from overestimating his skills as a politician and a
communicator in the wake of bathing in the international publicity of a
successfully hosted G7 summit.
A more complete explanation must come from the kind of advice the media
magnate turned politician has been getting from his close circle of
associates. Mr Berlusconi entered politics in January surrounded by a small
group of friends who were all either directly or indirectly linked to
Fininvest. They are still with him and have had to change from protecting Mr
Berlusconi's interests as owner of Fininvest to looking after these
interests as prime minister.
In any circumstances, the metamorphosis from being courtiers and managers to
executive politicians is a big adjustment. But to make this change at a time
when Italy has seen its traditional parties collapse and when complex
decisions are needed on economic policy and reform of Italy's institutions
requires a team of exceptional calibre. It is arguable whether they are up
to the task. Few have direct political experience beyond this year. The
group includes:
Mr Gianni Letta, former editor of Tempo, the daily linked to the Rome
Christian Democrats, and now the chief of staff in the prime minister's
office. He joined Fininvest as Mr Berlusconi's 'diplomatic' representative
in Rome at the crucial moment in the late 1980s when he was lobbying for
full commercial television licences.
Mr Marcello Dell'Utri, the manager of Publitalia, Fininvest's advertising
arm and friend of Mr Berlusconi since student days. He was instrumental in
encouraging Mr Berlusconi to enter politics and helped organise Forza Italia
as a political movement through the Publitalia network.
Mr Fidele Confalonieri, the chairman of Fininvest, another friend of student
days who helped Mr Berlusconi found his business empire.
Mr Cesare Previti, Mr Berlusconi's lawyer with a reputation as a successful
intermediary between business and government who is now defence minister (Mr
Berlusconi was talked out of making him justice minister).
If the government coalition were cohesive, Mr Berlusconi would probably have
felt more comfortable with a larger circle. But the two main partners, the
League and the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance of Mr Gianfranco Fini, are
constantly afraid they will become submerged by the force of Mr Berlusconi's
personality and accumulated authority. This makes Mr Berlusconi wary of Mr
Fini and openly mistrustful of the League.
As a result his kitchen cabinet, though by no means unanimous, has
encouraged Mr Berlusconi to assert himself - hence his various
confrontations with Mr Bossi that reached a climax this week.
If Mr Berlusconi wishes to survive, he may have to adopt a more collegiate
approach to government. In this way, if the League challenges him again, the
blame for any public embarrassment could, unlike this week, be shared more
evenly.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Subsidies would create opportunities
for apprentices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALASDAIR MACCONACHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a motor retailer and a private company, employing 75 technicians in
our after-sales activity, I feel very strongly that if the government or
Training and Enterprise Councils were to put more resources behind the
training of apprentices, there would be a great opportunity for training
youngsters.
The motor trader apprentice scheme is regarded as one of the best available.
Many of us, however, cannot afford to invest as much as we would like in the
development of young technicians.
If there were a reasonable subsidy behind apprentice training I am sure you
would see significant numbers of school leavers being given an excellent
opportunity.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Focusing on successful technological
innovation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN DODD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The article by Tom Foremski, 'When IT fails to measure up', and Guy de
Jonquieres' argument against the benefits from investment in high
technology, raise crucial issues.
One of the less well publicised results of the EU Corfu summit was the
acceptance of the Bangemann report, the thrust of which is that rapid
deployment of the 'information society' is central to Europe's, and
therefore the UK's, competitiveness.
At the heart of the issues being raised is the insufficient understanding by
business managers of the implications of the technology they are using and
technologists' lack of awareness of the business implications of what they
are developing and installing. (This, incidentally, is one of the causes of
the UK's ability to innovate but relative inability to capitalise on
innovation.)
The FEI, the trade association for the electronics industry, is stepping up
its efforts to address these issues. Two areas come to mind for action.
First, European and UK government-sponsored research and development. Here,
the focus continues to be heavily on new technological projects with less
attention paid to the processes in the technical community which move
projects to practical application. Virtually no attention is focused on the
behaviourial, management and social inhibitions to successful
implementation.
Second, UK educational policy lacks those elements that will enable people
to implement technology for business benefit and to understand the
importance of creating value and commercial success.
If these are not the right issues, we need to find those that are. We cannot
afford to continue with either the reality or a perception that the millions
poured into IT and other high technology is wasted. John Dodd,
director, ICT,

FT  23 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Sensibilities blunted by years of
welfare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DOMINIC HOBSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Regular readers of Joe Rogaly's column do not doubt that he is fired with
the anger of the disinherited. He is right to remind us of the deterioration
in the material conditions of the poor since 1979.
But in arguing that 'The Tory right cannot easily persuade us that kindness,
the essence of charity, figures in its calculations', he perpetuates the
commonest fallacy of collectivist thinking.
The willingness of politicians to advocate the redistribution of the income
and wealth of others, and of their supporters to vote for it, is not moral,
nor kind, nor altruistic, nor charitable.
It is merely the coercion and expropriation of one sect-ion of the
population by an-other.
'We can never have regard to the virtue of an action,' as David Hume reminds
us in A Treatise of Human Nature, 'unless the action be antecedently
virtuous. No action can be virtuous, but so far as it proceeds from a
virtuous motive.'
In social welfare, the authentic moral choices are those which men and women
make with their own time and money and not those which they are compelled to
make by the state.
The virtuous do not merely abide by the law but exercise their moral
faculties and personal judgment.
Unfortunately, the state now takes such a large proportion of personal
incomes, and monopolises so many aspects of welfare, that both the
opportunity and the means of making personal moral choices have quite
shrivelled up.
It is 50 years of the welfare state, not 15 years of Thatcherism, which has
blunted our sensibilities.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Wish they were there: MPs may be exhausted, but so is the
British public
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been a week for fresh faces and new political images. We saw the
broad smiles of the incoming members of the cabinet as they stepped into the
sunlight from the door of 10 Downing Street. Then the delight of Mr Tony
Blair as he was anointed the youngest-ever leader of the Labour party. Even
Mr Paddy Ashdown got into the act by shuffling the portfolios of the Liberal
Democrats' rather smaller political team.
There was talk at Westminster of new battle lines being drawn, of government
and opposition parties marking out the ground on which they will fight the
next general election. That may well be true. History may judge this week as
the beginning of a new era in British politics.
After all, who would have bet with any confidence three months ago that Mr
John Major would look secure? And look secure at the very moment that Labour
was choosing as its leader a 41-year-old public schoolboy committed to
recasting socialism into social democracy?
There was the odd dramatic moment also. Mr John Patten's dismissal as
education secretary had been widely predicted. But no one was quite sure
whether Mr Major would in the end have the courage to wield the knife. Mr
Patten was devastated.
Mr Blair's coronation likewise had been discounted. But the image of the
young leader telling his party he now had a mandate to ditch its precious
dogmas is one that will stick in the mind. So too will that of Mr Neil
Kinnock, the man who rescued Labour from extinction a decade ago, looking on
with the beaming satisfaction of a proud father.
But such moments mingled with palpable exhaustion. The politicians have
fought themselves to a standstill. The electorate has looked on with
undisguised disgust. Used car dealers, even journalists, attract more trust
nowadays than political leaders.
Westminster is still disconnected from the real world. The pubs this weekend
will not be buzzing with talk of Mr Jeremy Hanley's elevation to the Tory
party chairmanship or of Mr Blair's promise of a crusade for change.
The voters are a shrewder bunch than the self-assured insiders who proclaim
with absolute confidence that Mr Major is now safe; or that Mr Blair's
middle-class accent guarantees Labour victory in two dozen of southern
England's marginal constituencies.
Real people are still angry with Mr Major's government, very angry. But they
will need convincing that a man who was barely out of university when Labour
last governed Britain can do a better job.
Government and opposition face two more grinding years before a general
election, which need not take place until the spring of 1997. As ministers
and their opposition shadows prepared to clear their desks before heading
for the beaches, you could almost feel them willing a summer of political
peace.
They hope politics will remain on hold until they regroup in Bournemouth,
Blackpool and Brighton for their autumn conferences. There will be time
enough then to begin persuading a wider world that things have changed.
Mr Major's government is battered, demoralised but most importantly still
standing. The sensible people at the top of the government make no great
claims for this week's extensive but uninspiring ministerial shake-out.
Journalists struggling to find a theme or a strategy were told not to waste
their time. Reshuffles (with one or two spectacular exceptions) are not like
that. Mr Major's priority was competent government.
The shake-up was designed to advance that cause by rewarding talent,
punishing mistakes and putting round pegs into round holes. It was also
intended to ensure that the Tory MPs left Westminster with the notion that
Mr Major had at last restored his grip.
The Tory right might claim that it had done better out of the changes than
the centre-left. Certainly the Thatcherites were happy with the appointment
of Mr Michael Portillo to employment and Mr Jonathan Aitken as chief
secretary.
But, as usual, Mr Major built in a raft of checks and balances. Mr Hanley,
the unknown choice to run the Conservatives' general election campaign, is a
pro-European protege of Mr Chris Patten, a former chairman and now governor
of Hong Kong. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the centrist chancellor, still holds the
economic policy levers.
The economy is Mr Major's best hope. The latest statistics confirmed it is
growing quite fast. Inflation for the time being looks subdued. The recent
pace of falls in unemployment is unlikely to be sustained, but those in work
should begin to feel a bit more secure.
But the economy won't be enough. The government cannot risk another reckless
boom of the sort that puts real money in the voters' pockets. Some time soon
Mr Clarke is going to have to raise interest rates.
The chancellor is less certain than almost everyone else in the Tory party
that the public finances will improve sufficiently to allow him to bribe the
voters with large cuts in income tax in 1995 or 1996.
Mr Major needs a prospectus, a theme, something that will persuade the
nation he has an interest beyond clinging to office. He has been searching
for one almost from the moment he entered Downing Street. But the Citizen's
Charter will not do. Nor will Back to Basics. At this autumn's party
conference, he needs to ignore the gimmicks and aim for both clarity and
depth.
As for Mr Blair, so far he has not put a foot wrong. His promise this week
was both to excite the electorate and to reassure them: excite them with the
notion that Labour is the party of change; reassure them with the promise
that it has abandoned its past. Almost unnoticed he borrowed a phrase from
left-of-centre Toryism to encapsulate the message. We now have One Nation
Socialism.
He is an attractive figure. The comparisons with Kennedy and Clinton are not
as silly as they sound. He is much tougher than he looks: the sort of
politician who leaves you feeling slightly uneasy as the depth of his
ambition sinks in. And for the first time in living memory Labour has a
leader who is shaping the framework of political debate.
Mr Blair is right to judge that Labour wins elections when it has a capacity
to inspire the electorate. But despite the convincing nature of his victory
(another powerful image was of the party's trade union paymasters relegated
to the back of the hall as the result was announced), he must give substance
to his philosophy. Voters can be enthused by ideas and by values. But they
need policies to put them into context.
That leaves Mr Ashdown. It has been a dismal few weeks for the Liberal
Democrats. The party's disappointing performance in the European elections
last month has led the Westminster intelligentsia to write it off. Why
should the middle managers of Basingstoke vote for Mr Ashdown, when Mr Blair
is every bit as moderate?
It's an unfair assessment. The third party frequently has prospered
alongside a Labour resurgence. But Mr Ashdown needs to carve out a more
distinctive niche - and to abandon the fiction that his party could just as
well do a post-election deal with the Conservatives as with Labour.
Such decisions though can wait. For now, Mr Major, Mr Blair and Mr Ashdown
should pause to enjoy their summer break. They can be certain the voters
will not miss them.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Life with a frisky watchdog: A bite back by UK financial
services regulators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
City of London watchdogs have been snapping with particular vigour this
week. They almost seem to have been competing to see which could be toughest
on the financial organisations they regulate.
Two household names - Nationwide Building Society and Barclays' Life - have
been bitten over the past few days, and there are rumours that others may
become victims.
On Tuesday came the news that a visit from Lautro, the self-regulatory
organisation for the life insurance industry, had led Nationwide, the UK's
second-largest society, to bar temporarily its 1,300 financial services
staff from giving financial advice.
The next day, the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief
regulator, gave a rare public rebuke to Barclays' Life, the life and
pensions arm of the high street bank, for shortcomings in the training and
supervision of its 1,000-plus staff.
Such actions are signs of a toughening in regulators' attitudes towards the
organisations they supervise, and have been welcomed by some of those who
have previously criticised the watchdogs for being too lenient.
For instance, after Lautro's visit to Nationwide, Mr Stephen Locke, director
of policy at the Consumers' Association, commented: 'We're disappointed that
the regulator did not do it earlier, but it's better late than never.'
The irony is that the burst of disciplinary activity by Lautro - which has
fined more organisations in the first half of this year than in either 1992
or 1993 - will not stop its being put to sleep next year.
Its successor, the Personal Investment Authority, began operations at the
start of the week. The PIA was set up after a long debate about reforming a
widely-criticised system in which regulation of retail financial services is
split between Lautro and Fimbra, which supervises independent financial
advisers. The division led to complaints of inconsistent standards.
Another criticism of the old regime was that the regulators were too close
to the industry they supervise. Such concerns were revived this week when a
leaked memorandum about a Lautro inquiry into the selling by Prudential
Corporation, the UK's largest life insurer, of personal pensions to people
transferring out of occupational schemes, had suggested that Prudential was
trying to influence its regulator.
But even though the arguments for reforming the old system remain
compelling, the outbreak of activity by Lautro has highlighted two broad
problem areas that mean the transition to the PIA is unlikely to be smooth:
First, by il-lustrating how even household names such as Barclays have got
it wrong, the discipline imposed this week has re-inforced wide-spread
public concerns about standards of selling to private investors.
Second, it raises the question of whether the PIA, like Lautro which was set
up in 1986, will take several years to become effective. Given the
controversy it has already attracted, the new regulator could not afford
such a delay: it has already been snubbed by Prudential - which exercised
its right to be regulated directly by the SIB. Even some of the companies
that applied to join the PIA believe it will not be effective. If it fails
to make its mark swiftly, a move to a full-blown statutory system of
regulation is likely to return to the agenda.
The first of these two problems is the more serious, especially since the
sector already has an image problem. Mr Jim Stretton, deputy managing
director of Standard Life, the UK's largest mutual insurer, believes the
retail financial services industry is in a vicious circle: 'Each fine, far
from increasing public confidence that the system is working, awakens more
suspicions in people's minds.'
Similarly, Mr Philip Scott, the life and pensions general manager at Norwich
Union, which received a record Pounds 300,000 fine from Lautro in April,
says: 'The danger with the way it's currently happening is that it loses a
lot of confidence in an industry which is really needed . . . There is a
risk of people being frightened away from looking after their future.'
He is confident, however, that an effective regulatory regime is the
long-term answer to the industry's problems, even if that means short-term
discomfort for practitioners. For example, he believes that the PIA's
application of Lautro's training standards, which are seen as more stringent
than those of Fimbra, across the industry will be important.
Many in the financial services industry also believe there will be benefits
simply from having a different regulator able to make a fresh start and weed
out organisations which do not meet the new, higher standards being set.
Other life company executives believe that the publicity surrounding
disciplinary action has begun to make senior managers and directors pay
detailed attention to meeting regulatory requirements. As Mr Steve Maran,
chief executive of Lloyds Abbey Life, puts it: 'My board wants to discuss
compliance issues at every meeting.'
Mr Gareth Marr, deputy chairman of Fimbra, believes that many in the
industry have altered their attitude towards complying with regulatory
requirements, but the difference will take a while to show. 'They have
learnt that they can't get away with it any more,' he says, 'but the change
doesn't happen overnight.'
That change in attitudes leads many executives in the industry to believe
that, despite the uncertainties caused by the shift to a new regulator, the
PIA will not face the same regulatory learning curve that both Lautro and
Fimbra experienced. The PIA has already been tough enough to float the idea
of imposing fines on individual board members of errant financial services
companies.
Although the PIA is new, many of its staff come from the existing watchdogs.
'The PIA has involved an enormous amount of people's energy but at least it
has the benefit of staff who should be able to build on Lautro's work
without losing too much momentum,' says Mr Locke of the Consumers'
Association.
But the PIA does not have much time. Mr Marr believes that it has only until
the general election in 1996 or 1997 to prove itself effective, or find
itself replaced by a statutory regulatory regime. As a watchdog, it must be
a cross between rottweiler and greyhound.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: The right time to improve financial
services rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr S W HAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The decision of Mr Justice Lightman to dismiss the action for damages
by Melton Medes against the Securities and Investments Board constitutes an
important clarification of the regulator's powers.
However, the case is ironic for drawing attention to the inadequacy of SIB's
powers under Section 179 of the Financial Services Act. This section is
excessively restrictive in that it prevents the SIB from releasing
prescribed information to private litigants ('customers' in
financial-services parlance) in the position of the plaintiff beneficiaries
in the Melton Medes case, even if a court order had been obtained.
This issue gave rise to great concern among members of the social security
committee when they were interviewing Prof Roy Goode in connection with the
report of the pension law review committee. The report of the PLRC noted:
'The ability of existing regulators to exchange information among themselves
is severely handicapped by statutory restrictions on the use for one
regulatory purpose of information obtained for another.'
Prof Goode's committee recommended that such statutory restriction should be
removed and the government has embraced this principle in its recent white
paper.
However, this would not rectify the problem which relates not only to the
exchange of information between regulators but also between regulators and
private litigants. There is a clear need for legislation in this area
empowering the courts to direct the release of information held by a
regulator to any person the court deems appropriate.
Given that the government has recently published its white paper on pensions
and is in the process of preparing the pensions bill, now would seem to be a
good time to improve the interaction of regulatory rules and trust law
principles.

FT  23 JUL 94 / The sounds of a continent cracking: The west must recognise
its self-interest in dealing with the crisis engulfing Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The record is grim and it is no exaggeration to talk of crisis . . . What
is needed is a new kind of social compact, an agreement within the world
community that the struggle against poverty in Africa is a joint concern
which entails responsibilities for both parties'  - World Bank, 1981
The warnings have gone unheeded. Now come signs of a continent under
intolerable strain, poised between crisis and catastrophe, lacking both the
capacity and the will to implement economic and political reforms.
Rwanda is the latest in Africa's roll call of disasters over the past 20
years, during which at least 10m people have died and as many have become
refugees. For some governments, the strain has proved too much.
Zaire, almost straddling the waist of Africa, is less a state than a
collection of fiefdoms. Sudan, Africa's largest country, has been destroyed
by civil war, and Sierra Leone, Liberia, Somalia, Angola are joining them.
Worse may be to come, for two of Africa's most important countries are now
at risk: Nigeria in the west and Kenya in the east are both showing signs of
stress.
Nigeria's leaders squandered Dollars 100bn of oil earnings over the decade
of the oil boom from the 1970s to the early 1990s. External debt, currently
Dollars 34bn, rises by Dollars 6bn a year, the civil service is undermined
by political interference and corruption, per capita gross domestic product
has halved since 1980, the fault line is deepening between Moslem north and
Christian south.
Meanwhile Kenya is battling against impossible odds. Its population has
tripled over the past 20 years to 25m, land hunger grows, unemployment
rises, and 400,000 school-leavers compete annually for 20,000 jobs in formal
employment. Corruption and vested interests stand in the way of effective
reform.
Meanwhile Africa's rare 'success stories' such as Ghana and Uganda, are not
inspiring. 'Current growth rates among the best (emphasis added) African
performers are still too low to reduce poverty much in the next two or three
decades,' warned a recent World Bank review.
The Bank's hopes, back in 1989, that African economies could grow at a rate
of 4 to 5 per cent proved optimistic. Growth has been barely half that, well
below the region's 3.2 per cent annual rise in population. Unless
Sub-Saharan Africa's 'poor' economic policies improve, it will be 40 years
before the region returns to its per capita income of the mid-1970s, says
the Bank.
Dissenting voices suggest ways out of the predicament. 'More aid]' cries
one.
But aid has increased and the crisis deepens. Net aid transfers to Africa
increased from 5.6 per cent of regional GDP in the early 1970s to 8.3 per
cent in the late 70s, reaching 11.7 per cent of GDP by 1990. Sub-Saharan
Africa's share of global aid is up to 38 per cent in 1991 from 17 per cent
in 1970. A decade of structural adjustment, and net aid flows of Dollars
170bn, has stemmed the region's decline but not launched a revival.
'Reform the international trading system,' cry others, pointing to Africa's
deteriorating terms of trade. Perhaps, comes the response, but why has
Africa lost its market share of cocoa, tea, coffee to other third world
countries who live under the same system?
'Foreign investment is the key,' say others. But who will invest in a
continent where the infrastructure has deteriorated, skills are in short
supply, and instability endemic?
'Impose democracy by making aid conditional on good governance,' say western
governments. But democracy isn't working; and +++++++ End of Leg 3
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
the World Bank's report on the 'east Asian miracle' suggests there is not
necessarily a link, says another.
What can be done?
First, the World Bank, the continent's leading donor, and the aid agencies
must find common cause. Africa needs their vigorous lobbying of the west's
decision makers. John Clark, who used to work with Oxfam, put it well in his
book, Democratising Development: The Role of Voluntary Organisations.
Non-governmental organisations, he says, 'will make little headway unless
their ideas are grounded in economic reality and unless they search for
positive as well as negative lessons within the programmes of the World Bank
and other practitioners of development orthodoxy.'
Once there is agreement on the economic and political agenda,
non-governmental organisations should play a greater role. In certain
countries, where the mangement capacity of government is weak, NGOs should
run primary health care, or primary education, or drought relief.
The private sector should make investment decisions, rather than aid workers
without the necessary skills. Increase transparency. Too often donors are
willing to conceal what they know of corruption in African governments. They
fail to insist on minimum levels of accountability and access to
information. By withholding or denying African electorates information about
structural adjustment programmes, they stifle debate about economic policy.
Constitution making. Hopes for the revival of democracy will be dashed
unless Africa draws up constitutions which take account of ethnic, religious
and regional differences. Rebuild the parties and institutions of democratic
government. Set levels of military spending at a percentage of GDP below
spending on housing, education and health. Radical measures to ease Africa's
debt burden should be accompanied by tougher monitoring of reform policies,
including donor officials in institutions such as central banks and finance
ministries.
If governments are not willing to embrace structural adjustment and good
governance requirements, then donors should only finance humanitarian
projects.
Above all, the west must be motivated by self-interest as much as compassion
in its response to the African crisis. Possible solutions will only be
implemented when an ailing Africa is seen as a threat and as a loss.
As Africa's economy declines, so immigration to southern Europe will rise;
Moslem extremism will intensify; drug-trafficking will increase; disease,
whether Aids or the discovery of bubonic plague in Zaire, will pose a
serious health problem; environmental erosion or neglect will lead to the
destruction of valuable flora and fauna.
Africa cannot be ring-fenced: and the longer a co-ordinated response to its
crisis is postponed, the more daunting become the problems and more serious
the consequences of failure.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Man in the news: Lara's lucrative theme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brian Lara, the phenomenon from Trinidad, broke another world record last
week, landing the largest individual corporate sponsorship contract ever
awarded to a cricketer.
Mercury Asset Management, the UK's largest fund manager, has signed Lara to
a two and a half year contract for Pounds 100,000. Its value could rise to
Pounds 500,000 depending upon his performance on the cricket field. MAM has
also informally agreed to make contributions to mostly Trinidadian charities
in Lara's name.
This deal is unique in a sport in which the average England county cricketer
earns Pounds 20,000 a year or less. Nick Leigh, a director of
Birmingham-based Kennedy Street Enterprises, the agent for Ian Botham and
Viv Richards, says it is worth paying Lara such sums because of the crowds
he attracts. 'You go to your average county cricket game and it's just one
man and his dog,' he says, adding that the attendance is perhaps 1,800.
Denis Amiss, chief executive of Warwickshire, Lara's club, says gate
receipts from crucial home matches are likely at least to double this year
to Pounds 100,000. He says Lara's arrival added 900 members to the club, to
take the total to 8,400.
The conversion of Brian Charles Lara, cricket sensation, into Brian Lara,
earnings sensation, occurred over several years, according to his agent, Mr
Jonathan Barnett, director of Stellar Promotions.
Lara is the youngest of 11 children of a close-knit family from the village
of Cantar, Trinidad. Barnett says Lara got his first cricket bat at the age
of six from an older sister who had spotted an advertisement in a local
newspaper for the Harvard Clinic, where children were taught cricket.
Barnett first met Lara, then 22, during the West Indies tour of England in
the summer of 1991. He was a junior player who never got on to the field,
but even so, West Indian batsman Viv Richard hailed him as the next
sensation from the Caribbean.
Barnett, who used to run the sports promotion division of the failed Levitt
Group, was asked by Richards' then agent, David Cobb, to take Lara on as a
client. Richards' own agent was leaving the business and could not do it
himself. 'I went to see him up at Worcester,' Barnett said. 'Viv introduced
me to Brian Lara and said, 'This guy is going to be a star.' '
Sponsorship came early. Since he was a teenage batting sensation in
Trinidad, Angostura Bitters has been a backer, putting Lara on the payroll
as a public relations consultant. Smaller local firms have paid for coaching
sessions and equipment. 'The ones who sponsored him early we have kept on,'
Barnett said. 'And we haven't raised the rates.'
The first sponsorship deal arranged by Barnett was a Dollars 10,000-a-year
contract with Oakley, the US-based sunglass manufacturer, which also signed
similar contracts with two other Pakistani cricketers, both clients of
Barnett. Although Barnett was unsuccessful in negotiating a sponsorship
arrangement for Lara with BWIA, the West Indian airline, Lara was given the
equivalent of Pounds 40,000 worth of free air miles for himself and his
mother, Pearl.
When Shami Ahmed, chief executive of Joe Bloggs sportswear, saw Lara step
off an aircraft after his triumphant West Indies tour in April, wearing a
Joe Bloggs shirt, he approached Barnett about a deal. Lara wears the
company's jeans and T-shirts exclusively whenever he wears casual clothing,
and the company is marketing a line of shirts and trousers to capitalise on
his batting score.
It was Barnett who initiated the deal with MAM. David Manasseh, Barnett's
partner, said he spotted MAM's use of vivid sports imagery in the company's
first-ever print advertising campaign and asked whether it would like a real
sports superstar to promote its image. The answer was a resounding yes.
But despite the higher profile that Lara has brought to the game and to his
sponsors, questions are being raised by sports commentators and other
cricketers about the effect of the sponsorship contracts on his talent. He
has been criticised in the press for taking out a mobile phone on the field,
with commentators pointing out that one sponsor is a mobile phone company.
Such actions have not endeared him to his team-mates, and threaten to
undermine the widespread public admiration for a man who, off the field, is
widely described as modest, gracious and warm.
Ted Dexter, former England team captain and former head of the England Test
Match Selectors, says: 'Yes, there is such a thing as too much sponsorship.
The fact is you can't just turn playing concentration on and off.'
However, he says, Lara will have to learn how to juggle his interests, just
like other leading sports figures such as Botham and David Gower. Dexter,
who now heads a sports sponsorship firm bearing his name, is sympathetic.
'Lara just wants financial security like the rest of us,' he says.
Barnett dismisses the carping as 'jealousy and navete', and says that all
Lara's sponsorship activities should not take up more than 14 days a year in
total.
He argues that cricketers generally suffer from a kind of collective public
view - fostered by sportswriters - that it is unseemly for them to earn
large sums. He points out that the cricket players' union, the Cricketers'
Association, is funded by the Test and County Cricket Board, the owners'
association, a relationship which limits the players' ability to campaign
aggressively for better pay and conditions.
But if Lara continues to break world records, public sentiment is likely to
endorse every penny he earns. In April, he broke the world record for the
highest score in a Test innings when, playing for the West Indies, he made
375 against England. In June, he hit a world record for a first-class
innings, 501 for Warwickshire, against Durham. He is the first cricketer to
hold both world records since Sir Donald Bradman, widely regarded as the
greatest batsman of all time.
Whatever deals Lara does, he has already made history.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Food, water - and troops: How the world should aid Rwanda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has happened again, and on the most horrific scale yet. True, the
absolute number of refugees displaced by the Afghan war was higher, but that
problem built up over a period of years.
In Rwanda, more than 2m people have fled into neighbouring countries since
April 6; most of them within the past two weeks. And, as Boutros
Boutros-Ghali, the UN secretary-general, said yesterday, 'another million
may be on their way'. If one adds the people displaced within the country,
more than half Rwanda's 7m people have been uprooted.
As many of these people face death by starvation, or from cholera and other
diseases to which their resistance is lowered by malnutrition and lack of
sanitation or clean drinking-water, clearly the first priority must be to
get emergency aid to them, in the shape of food, medical supplies, water
tankers and equipment for digging latrines. The UN yesterday issued an
appeal to governments to provide services 'as self-contained packages' in
airport services, domestic fuel, sanitation facilities and water management.
The UN estimates financial requirements at about Dollars 435m, and is
begging governments to make resources available without delay. It points out
that this time it has succeeded in co-ordinating the efforts of all its
specialised agencies and of some 30 non-governmental organisations -
something governments blamed it for failing to do in previous emergencies.
At present, aid is not getting through fast enough, because of the
difficulty of reaching the refugees. Forty-five Hercules aircraft each day
are needed to bring in food at Goma alone, says Nigel Twose, international
director of the British charity Actionaid. After blaming the French for
restricting the number of flights, the UN has now taken control of the
airstrip at Goma, only to find it is the Zairean authorities which have
imposed a limit of 20 flights a day. One of the most urgent priorities is
therefore to 'persuade' them to relax that limit, and to put in an expert
team to maintain the runway so the strip can take flights around the clock.
It is clear that humanitarian aid is not enough to cope with this situation.
Indeed, it may make matters worse if it is concentrated on or close to the
borders, and thereby encourages the population to gather there in large
concentrations where they will become permanently dependent on international
relief. It is vital to get people back to their homes quickly.
This is also what the new government wants, and it therefore has a strong
incentive to co-operate with the UN in reassuring people that they will not
be massacred. But mere verbal assurances will hardly be enough. Aid should
be made available inside the country to returning refugees, and there will
have to be a visible presence of foreign troops to reassure them.
The French deserve credit for saving thousands of lives in the area they
have occupied. But many of the people who carried out the genocide against
the Tutsi in April and May have taken refuge in that area, which the French
now propose to leave by August 22, taking all their equipment with them. If
they are to be replaced by ill-equipped African troops, it is vital that
they be persuaded either to leave or to replace their equipment, and that
other countries with well-equipped armed forces make good on the promise to
provide equipment which they gave back in May. It would be even better if
some of those countries were willing to send their own troops.
Troops are necessary, but should be there only to stabilise the situation
during a political reconciliation process, which may be easier at local
level, given strong community leadership, than at the top. Clearly the RPF
will not forgive the main instigators of genocide, but it should be helped
by external powers to set up an unimpeachable judicial process; and it must
be persuaded to limit retribution to the main instigators. If every Hutu
with blood on his or her hands were to be hunted down, much of the
population would choose to remain in exile and prepare for yet another 'war
of liberation'.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Policy in the upturn
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Now more than ever, the makers of monetary policy can expect their every
word to be probed for signs of a change in policy. The trouble is that both
the tools of their trade and market reactions to their efforts have become
increasingly unreliable.
The obvious approach is to make things clearer. The decision to publish the
minutes of the British chancellor of the exchequer's monthly meetings with
the governor of the Bank of England was a significant step in this
direction. In the account of the June meeting - published this week - Mr
Eddie George judged the situation 'very favourable' and Mr Kenneth Clarke
was happy to agree.
UK growth in output, as evidenced by Friday's preliminary estimates of
growth in total gross domestic product of 3.3 per cent for the year to June,
continues to exceed the historical trend. Excluding the erratic output of
oil from the North Sea, however, the increase was only 2.7 per cent.
Although the narrow measure of money supply is currently growing above its
target range, the eclectic range of other monitored variables does not
indicate any need for immediate monetary tightening. Or so the chancellor
and the governor agreed.
Their judgment looks sensible. One reason the Bank seems to be relatively
sanguine about inflation is its estimate that the economy has an output gap
of 6 per cent of GDP, following the long recession. For all that,
bottlenecks may emerge quite soon. The steep slope of the UK yield curve
indicates that the markets are concerned about the possibility of higher
inflation (and higher interest rates) in the not too distant future. Base
rates will indeed have to rise from their current low level, though, with
luck, not much before the end of the year.
Timid moves
The same has been said for some time about American official interest rates,
an impression which the Federal Reserve chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan, did
nothing to remove this week. During the first of his biannual testimonies to
Congress at the beginning of the year, he tried to forewarn the markets of
higher interest rates. Consequently, he was surprised by the dramatic plunge
in the bond market that followed his first timid moves towards a
long-canvassed tightening of the US monetary stance.
It seems that for a central bank to explain what it is about to do is not as
helpful as might be expected. The only answer is for it to try still harder.
One thing he has consistently pointed out is that for the US to take the
lead in tightening monetary policy is a necessary side-effect of America's
head-start in the world's move out of recession. He also signalled that the
international aspects of monetary policy - above all, the level of the
dollar - were not going to be left out of the equation.
Bids for a dollar recovery are also being voiced by members of the Clinton
administration. Yet, ever since the G7 in Naples decided that the dollar's
fall could not be prevented, the currency has in fact stabilised. An adapted
law of unintended consequences might suggest that supportive comments from
Washington will send it down again. A steady further depreciation of the
American currency remains the conventional financial market wisdom. But the
market's conventional wisdom is almost automatically wrong. If everyone has
sold the dollar short already, who is left to do so?
Odd weakness
For all the concern about the American trade account, the dollar's weakness
looks somewhat odd, given that short-term US interest rates may soon exceed
German ones, an event which Mr Greenspan's careful comments brings closer.
The betting on such a 'cross-over' was only marginally confused by the
Bundesbank's decision, announced on Thursday, to fix its 'repurchase' rate
at 4.85 per cent for the next four weeks. In effect, this reduced the rate
by only 3 basis points over the coming weeks, a contorted way of limiting
speculation about the timing of future rate cuts.
The Bundesbank had reason enough for its contortions. It has been cutting
interest rates in the light of the performance of inflation, which has been
falling, and of the economy, which has been recovering slowly. In the
meantime, it has chosen to ignore its target for broad money, whose growth
this year has been far above the 4-6 per cent target range. In the last two
months, however, the money supply has ceased growing, while the economy has
been picking up. As a result, pressure to cut interest rates has diminished.
It is even possible that German interest rates are not far from their floor.
This week's talk from the Bank of Japan about recovery suggests that the
same is true there.
Yet even if the global short-term interest rate cycle is near bottom, US
and, for that matter, UK rates are almost certain to rise, relative to those
in D-Marks and yen. In their myopic way, markets may suddenly notice this
development. If so, the story of the second half of 1994 might be the
strength of the dollar, and even of the pound.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Tories increase pressure for assembly in Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior Conservative backbenchers are stepping up pressure on the government
to accede to unionist calls to finalise plans for a devolved Northern
Ireland assembly without waiting to agree an all-embracing settlement.
Senior MPs are encouraging ministers to abandon the old 'nothing is agreed
until everything is agreed' formula governing political talks on Northern
Ireland's future, in favour of an undertaking that nothing is implemented
until everything is agreed.
They suggest such a change could enable cross-party backing for a blueprint
for devolved government to be secured more quickly without departing from
the so-called three-stranded approach supported by nationalists.
This requires relations between Ulster and Dublin and London and Dublin to
be dealt with in the same process as the province's internal politics for
the purposes of the current talks.
News of the MPs' initiative emerged amid indications that unionists and Tory
rightwingers have been heartened by remarks made by Sir Patrick Mayhew,
Northern Ireland secretary, this week.
Sir Patrick told The Daily Telegraph newspaper that Dublin's territorial
claim to Ulster was the central issue to be resolved in drafting a joint
framework document aimed at encouraging the province's political parties to
return to the negotiating table.
Meanwhile leaders of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, prepared for this
weekend's conference - at which the party's response to the Downing Street
declaration is expected to be decided - as the cycle of violence in the
province continued with a killing and a spate of firebomb attacks. Mr Bobby
Monaghan, 44, a Catholic barman, was shot by loyalist gunmen from the
outlawed Ulster Freedom Fighters in Newtonabbey, north of Belfast.
In London, two High Court judges indicated that they intend to refer the
government ban on Mr Gerry Adams visiting mainland Britain to the European
Court of Justice in Luxembourg.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Ffestiniog wins fight for rail route
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A fierce battle between rival steam railway companies for control of a
23-mile stretch of disused line through Snowdonia national park has been
decided this week.
Mr John MacGregor, in one of his last acts as transport secretary, gave
approval for the Ffestiniog Railway to acquire the railway bed against a
rival claim from the Welsh Highland Light Railway.
In deciding in favour of Ffestiniog Mr MacGregor overturned the
recommendation of the inspector who chaired a four-week public inquiry into
the rival bids last year.
His ruling clears the way for Ffestiniog, which already runs a successful
steam railway over a 13-mile route between Blaenau Ffestiniog and
Porthmadog, to create a 36-mile loop through the national park to the
tourist centre of Caernarfon on the north Wales coast.
Mr MacGregor came down in favour of Ffestiniog in part because of its
experience. The company, which employs 60 people alongside 6,000 volunteers,
expects to invest Pounds 350,000 in its existing line this year. It carries
nearly 200,000 people a year with a turnover of Pounds 2m.
Work on restoring a service on the disused track bed could take up to 15
years to complete and cost between Pounds 10m and Pounds 15m.
Mr Gordon Rushton, the general manager of the Ffestiniog Railway, is
offering the Welsh Highland Light Railway, an entirely voluntary
organisation, the chance to co-operate on the project but considerable
bitterness remains between the two.
Disputes between rival railway enthusiasts are not uncommon. The Association
of Railway Preservation Societies said it was a pity so much money, which
could have been spent on restoring the railway, had been wasted on legal
expenses.
The decision in favour of Ffestiniog could be seen as a further small step
down the road towards privatising Britain's railway network. The Welsh
Highland bid had the support of Gwynedd county council and a number of other
local councils - one reason for the inspector recommending Welsh Highland at
the inquiry.
But Mr MacGregor concluded that the inspector had attached 'too little
weight to the benefits of placing such matters entirely within the private
sector'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Radio Authority has asked the government to simplify ownership rules for
commercial radio stations.
Limits on how many stations a company can own are determined by a points
system. A national commercial station is worth 25 points, while a local
station is worth three points.
No group can own more than 15 per cent of the points or more than 20
licences, more than six London and large metropolitan stations, or two FM
stations in any area.
The authority wants to preserve the 15 per cent rule, but believes most of
the others are no longer necessary.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Consortium set to buy LT advertising
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
London Transport looks set to sell its advertising arm, London Transport
Advertising, to a consortium led by the largest transport advertising
company in the US, Transportation Displays Incorporated, and Hambro Group
Investments.
LT said yesterday that it was dropping all but two from its shortlist - the
consortium, and a management and employee buy-out. LT said the consortium
was its preferred bidder.
The decision means that a Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation
into a bid for LTA by poster company More O'Ferrall is likely to be called
off. The company, which was on the shortlist until yesterday, would have
controlled about 38 per cent of London's outdoor advertising market if it
had been successful.
LT said the referral 'was not a factor' in dropping the company from the
shortlist.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Swans bidder to meet Rifkind
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, and Mr Roger Freeman, defence
procurement minister, will on Tuesday meet the head of Soffia, the parent of
the French-based company CMN, which is the sole prospective buyer for
Tyneside shipbuilder Swan Hunter, Chris Tighe writes.
CMN has said it will only buy the yard if the government guarantees two
years' base workload. Swans' present work finishes in November.
An offer to Swans by the Ministry of Defence of the Pounds 6m refit of the
tanker Olwen depends on the yard finding a buyer and ending its receivership
by August 1.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Whitehall computer spending 'to fall'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Spending by the civil service on computer systems is set to fall in 1994-95
for the first time in five years, according to one of the first detailed
analyses of expenditure by the government on information technology.
The biggest fall, of 48 per cent, is at the Department of Social Security
which, with the Exchequer - comprising Treasury, Customs and Excise and
Inland Revenue - and the Ministry of Defence, accounts for about two-thirds
of the Pounds 2.5bn spent annually by government departments and agencies on
hardware, software, external services and computer staff.
The analysis, carried out by Kable, a research group specialising in
public-sector information systems, does not take into account the dramatic
decline in prices for computer hardware over the past few years. Kable
concludes nevertheless that the boom is over for equipment suppliers. It
says: 'Civil service hardware spend has risen an average 5 per cent a year
over the past four years. At the depth of the recession in 1991-92,
government was decidedly popular with the computer industry as budgets rose
20 per cent. This year, equipment spend is set to drop 10 per cent.'
The Kable study sets benchmarks for government IT spending when, as a
consequence of market-testing and the outsourcing of computer operations,
the picture will become much more complex.
Personal computers accounted for 42 per cent of spending on hardware by the
civil service last year. The MoD alone spent Pounds 86. The most successful
supplier that year was the US manufacturer Compaq with a 14 per cent share.
Some Pounds 303m was spent on software last year, representing 12 per cent
of overall IT spending. The largest share, 45 per cent, was spent on
specially written software. In commercial data processing, pre-written or
packaged software is increasingly preferred.
Departments spent a total of Pounds 127m on consultancy, representing 5 per
cent of their systems budgets. However, the DSS and the Exchequer each spent
8 per cent of their budgets while Northern Ireland spent less than 0.1 per
cent.
Market testing - where the performance of in-house operations is measured -
also threw up broad differences. The leaders - the Exchequer and the MoD -
have each tested Pounds 350m worth of services while the Department of
Social Security and the Lord Chancellor's Department have not tested
activities worth more than 1 per cent of their gross running costs.

FT  23 JUL 94 / 'Manchester plc' profits up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Manchester plc', the aggrega-tion of the results of the top 100 companies
in the conurbation, made Pounds 1.48bn pre-tax profit in 1993-94, a rise of
6.5 per cent over the previous year's Pounds 1.39bn - in spite of the period
reflecting the worst effects of recession for many of the companies
involved.
The 'accounts', compiled by Manchester's KPMG Peat Marwick, lag behind the
economy because they are a compilation of figures which are themselves
historical.
Mr Alan Benzie, managing partner of KPMG in Manchester, warns that
confidence remains fragile and the strength of recovery will require careful
monitoring if companies are to become sufficiently reassured to try to force
expansion again.
Turnover - the criterion by which the 100 companies were selected and ranked
 -was only Pounds 10,000 short of Pounds 29bn, compared with Pounds 27.94bn
in the 1992-93 'accounts'. Although this was only a 3.8 per cent increase,
as opposed to the previous year's 4.9 per cent, it was ahead of an inflation
rate of less than 3 per cent.
This means that combined with increased profitability, industry and commerce
gained in efficiency and performance as recession forced restructuring, on
manufacturers in particular. This helped ensure an almost unchanged return
on capital of 8.3 per cent.
Operating profit was marginally better at 6.3 per cent compared with 5.8 per
cent.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Entertainment role to be urged for telecoms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications would be free to carry entertainment services in
some parts of Britain by the late 1990s under proposals to be unveiled by
MPs next week.
The Commons trade and industry committee is expected to recommend sweeping
changes to the licensing, franchising and exclusivity arrangements that
govern the industry.
The Tory-controlled body is expected to urge ministers to remove uncertainty
which MPs feel has been dogging the sector. It is likely to say the
regulatory system is too rigid.
The report comes amid mounting calls for the government to rethink its
policy banning BT and Mercury Communications from offering entertainment
services over their existing networks until at least 2001. BT is most hard
hit because, unlike Mercury, it has a local network.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said last month that
the ban could create local telecommunications monopolies in the shape of
cable-television companies if continued for too long.
His remarks came three weeks after Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, flatly rejected a Labour proposal to lift the ban in return for
BT agreeing to invest heavily in extending fibre-optic cables into its local
network.
He said it would be 'the gravest possible breach of integrity' for the
government to go back on its word to the cable companies.
When imposed in 1991, the ban's aim was to encourage cable companies to
invest in local cable networks, providing telecoms services in competition
with BT.
Next week's report is expected to recommend that the government starts
reviewing the exclusive rights given to cable companies to carry
entertainment on a franchise-by-franchise basis as they mature.
This could have the effect of allowing public telecoms operators into the
entertainment market well before the end of this decade.
Many observers believe the strongest case for an early lifting of the ban is
in parts of the country not covered by cable franchises.
Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, is empowered to report on the
desirability of lifting the ban from 1998. But Mr Don Cruickshank, Oftel's
head, has played down the prospect of even a review of the BT ban before
2001.
The cable companies say the ban is essential to ensure the viability of
their planned Pounds 6bn investment in the next five years.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Rising building costs 'to push up prices by 10%'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prices quoted by building groups bidding for contracts are forecast to rise
by up to 10 per cent in the next year as they seek to recover profit margins
and pass on increased material and labour costs.
EC Harris, international construction cost consultants, said yesterday that
in spite of the rise, tender prices were expected to remain 15 per cent
lower than at the peak of the development boom in 1989.
It forecast that construction tender prices nationally would rise 5.5 per
cent in the next year with an identical increase over the next 12 months, to
autumn 1996.
Prices in London, where the resurgence in construction has been greatest,
are forecast to rise by as much as 7 per cent on average in 1994-95.
Mr Christopher Vickers, EC Harris chairman, said the rises 'could surprise
customers who, after two years of virtual stagnation in construction tender
prices, have become accustomed to fairly constant prices'.
Prices of building materials rose 6 per cent on average in the 12 months to
the end of April - more than twice the increase in the retail prices index
over the same period.
Plasterboard and constructional steel prices rose by more than 10 per cent
on average. Prices of bricks, concrete blocks, cement, concrete roof tiles
and clay pipes also rose more than the sector average.
The figures mask wide regional variations. Structural steel prices
nationally averaged Pounds 836 a tonne compared with about Pounds 950 a
tonne in London. Concrete floor-slabs were priced at Pounds 70 a cubic metre
in London compared with Pounds 59 nationally.
The pace of recovery in the housing market continued to slow last month
although sales of new homes are holding up better than those in general
market, the Housebuilders Federation reported yesterday.
Almost half of the 471 housebuilders questioned in a survey said that agreed
sales on which a deposit has been paid, less any cancellations, had fallen
since May.
Most builders, however, reported that these agreed sales were higher than in
June last year, when the housing market also fell, after starting the year
strongly.
The federation said: 'Although growth in the new-homes market has been
sustained, the June survey showed that the rate of growth has slowed
significantly. Sales of new homes have continued to out-perform sales in the
second-hand market.'

FT  23 JUL 94 / Gas bills set to increase, MPs told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gas prices may have to rise for some consumers as competition is introduced
into the domestic market, British Gas has told the government.
In a letter to cabinet ministers and selected MPs Mr Cedric Brown, the chief
executive, says that the removal of cross subsidies meant 'there will need
to be a period of transition in which some price adjustments are necessary'.
This is because small consumers are subsidised by large consumers.
Competition is expected to be more intense among large gas users however,
and British Gas has already said it may have to cut prices in that segment
of the market to protect its position. This would mean that charges might
have to go up for small users.
Mr Brown confirms in his letter that British Gas would like to see the date
proposed for the start of phased-in competition - April 1996 - put back. He
stresses that this is because more time is needed to introduce changes,
including completely new computer and operational systems.
British Gas remains committed to full competition by the government's target
date of April 1998.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Court fails to answer Mercury's bitterness: A decision which
will affect utilities and regulators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The refusal by the Court of Appeal yesterday to interfere in the dispute
between Mercury and Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, will not only
affect Mercury. It has ramifications for wider telecoms competition in the
UK and for the relationship of utility regulators with the courts.
Mercury has long been aggrieved by what it regards as excessive prices it
pays British Telecommunications for delivering its long-distance calls to
their final destination across the local BT network.
This discontent has turned to bitterness in the face of recent large cuts in
BT prices and fast-growing competition from new operators licensed since the
abolition in 1991 of the BT/Mercury duopoly.
Although BT carries 85 per cent of all phone calls by value, the new
competitors could harm Mercury more than BT because their target is the
corporate market, which is Mercury's main source of revenue.
Mercury's complaints are complex but boil down to two issues.
It believes that the so-called 'access deficit contributions' (ADCs) - which
it pays to compensate BT for losses it makes on its local network  - are a
tax on competition.
It also challenges the current basis for interconnection payments.
Mercury says that a capacity-based system - under which competitors would
pay BT mostly for peak-rate capacity, not individual calls - would be fairer
than the current per-call system.
The court case concerned the latter issue, capacity-based charging.
Unless Mercury can persuade the House of Lords to overturn the Court of
Appeal's decision it will have to return to Oftel to secure a change.
Oftel says, however, that Mercury has provided it with no more than a
sketchy outline of the new system it wants, and industry analysts are
sceptical that a capacity-based system could be made to work in practice.
In the process, however, Mercury has raised important questions about the
role of the courts in supervising utility regulators.
Mr Don Cruickshank, director-general of Oftel, deprecates the idea of the
courts playing an integral role in the regulatory process, arguing that it
would bring all the evils of the US telecoms industry 'where no-one -
regulators or industry - knows what is or isn't allowed'.
The verdict the Court of Appeal has delivered is an ambiguous one.
In dismissing Mercury's case without allowing it to rehearse the detailed
points at issue the court refused to involve itself and refrained from
setting a precedent for other companies or organisations  - particularly in
the environmental field - disgruntled with a regulator.
However, the judges made comments which might encourage Mercury and others
to try their luck in future.
One of the three judges ruled that Mercury had made out a case worth a
judicial hearing. And one of the judges in the majority said he was 'not
persuaded' by Mr Cruickshank's basic argument that the courts should not
interfere in Oftel's interpretation of the issues at stake, although he
dismissed Mercury's case for other reasons.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Blair says unions will have no special place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair yesterday warned union leaders not to expect privileged access
to the next Labour government and suggested that only millionaires would pay
more tax.
As cabinet ministers launched a vitriolic attack on the new Labour leader,
Mr Blair set out his vision for the party in a series of interviews charting
his course for the centre ground of British politics.
He firmly slapped down Mr Ken Livingstone, the only leftwing MP openly to
criticise his election, and dismissed forecasts of a clash on employment
policy with Mrs Margaret Beckett, the former deputy leader whom he beat in
the leadership ballot.
Mr Blair told BBC Radio that unions would have no more influence over the
next Labour government than employers, in spite of the unions'
constitutional role in the Labour party.
He said: 'Trade unions will have no special or privileged place within the
Labour party. They will have the same access as the other side of industry.
They are not going to be told that they are not a part of our society. But
we are not running the next Labour government for anyone other than the
people of this country.'
Mr Blair went out of his way to reassure better-off voters that Labour had
abandoned the 'soak-the-rich' approach of the 1970s, and had no plans for a
return to penal taxation.
Using language calculated to demonstrate the depth of change in Labour's
approach, he pledged: 'I am not anti-wealth. If someone goes out through
hard work and graft and makes themselves a millionaire, good luck to them.
'But it is right, in that set of circumstances, that they should not be
able, by hiring the right accountants, to avoid paying tax altogether.'
But, he said, the number of top-rate taxpayers had tripled under the
Conservatives to include primary school teachers and policemen, who could
not be called rich.
'That is not what the Labour party is talking about at all,' he said. The
objective was to tax those who 'end up paying virtually no tax or can use
offshore trusts or tax shelters not to pay their fair share'.
Mr Blair was clearly irritated by Mr Livingstone's claims that the 'lovey
creatures and the spin-doctors' running the party had avoided substantive
policy issues in the election campaign.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, dismissed Mr Blair in a speech in
Edinburgh as a 'political mannequin'. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health
secretary, described his election campaign as 'candy floss'.

FT  23 JUL 94 / C&amp;G makes most profit per customer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society made an average of Pounds 82 profit
out of each of its 1.4m customers last year, according to analysis carried
out by Datamonitor, the market research group.
This made it the society profiting most from its customer base. The next
most profitable per customer was Woolwich Building Society, the UK's third
largest, which made an average of Pounds 39 out of each its 4.2m customers.
It was the most successful at generating commission income through its
branches.
The research into the different strategies adopted by societies for their
branch networks revealed that the way the network was run was unprofitable
for some societies.
The figures suggest that Leeds &amp; Holbeck made a loss of Pounds 24 a customer
on its branch network last year, while Nationwide, the second-largest
society by asset size but with the largest branch network, made a Pounds 13
loss per customer.
They also show that for a significant minority of societies analysed, the
branch network was broadly neutral in terms of profit last year.
Datamonitor said yesterday that the calculations took account only of the
profitability of societies' branches, and not of profits from other aspects
of their activities, such as dealing in wholesale money markets, or from
estate agents.
Although C&amp;G is the sixth-largest society by assets, it has only 236
branches and mortgage centres, contributing to a low cost-income ratio. It
is the object of an agreed cash bid of Pounds 1.8bn from Lloyds Bank.
Datamonitor said its research showed Halifax, Alliance &amp; Leicester and
Nationwide, three of the four largest societies, had relatively low
commission income per customer but higher numbers of customers per branch,
while other societies concentrated on generating higher levels of net
commission per customer.
Halifax is to set up its own life insurance operation from the start of next
year, and Nationwide announced in May that it too intended to set up life
insurance and unit trust subsidiaries.
Datamonitor saw the greatest scope for percentage increases in generating
new net income for A&amp;L and Nationwide.

Mrs Gillian Shephard aims to make the improvement of academic and vocational
training for students aged 16 and over one of her top priorities at the
Department for Education.
As fresh details of changed ministerial responsibilities emerged yesterday
in the wake of this week's reshuffle, senior aides of the new education
secretary said she was keen to focus on the 16-plus age group which had been
'traditionally neglected'. Mrs Shephard was 'passionately concerned' about
the education of all students aged 16 and above whatever their ability, the
aides said.
Mrs Shephard's system of priorities may spark a change of culture at her new
department, which has long favoured the academic rather than the vocational.
As a former employment secretary Mrs Shephard is acutely aware of the
workplace dimension and is likely to accelerate developments which encourage
what is called 'parity of esteem' between vocational and academic
qualifications.
She is also likely to question her department's strategy of setting
aggressive targets for pupils staying on at school, and whether the
work-based route is better for some.
She is expected to welcome the planned introduction of qualifications which
assess practical skills into schools.
It was Mrs Shephard who started work at the Department of Employment on the
'modern apprenticeship' - a work-based training alternative to staying on at
school - which will be introduced next year.
She was also a keen advocate of a 'universal credit' being offered to all
young people at 16, whether staying on at school or leaving to take a
training place on Youth Training, the government's main training scheme for
unemployed young people.
Mrs Shephard's other priorities at the department are expected to include
nursery education and re-establishing what her aides describe as the
'constructive' dialogue she enjoyed with union leaders as employment
secretary
Details of ministerial responsibilities in the Department of Trade and
Industry and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food were published
yesterday.
At the DTI, Lord Ferrers, the former Home Office minister, will assume
responsibility for small companies and consumer affairs, while Mr Tim Eggar
will take on the Post Office in addition to his energy-related duties. Mr
Charles Wardle, another former Home Office minister, will provide support
for Mr Eggar. Mr Ian Taylor will have responsibility for telecommunications
and some trade matters. At agriculture, Mrs Angela Browning will succeed Mr
Nicholas Soames as food minister.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Chinese dream sours for high-flying entrepreneur: The
detention of James Peng on suspicion of corruption has turned the spotlight
on a secretive and primitive legal system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the past nine months, Mr James Peng, a China-born Australian
businessman, has been held without charge on suspicion of 'corruption' in
Shenzhen's Meiling detention centre in southern China. If Mr Peng is found
guilty of corruption he faces a minimum prison term of 10 years and possibly
the death penalty.
The fate of 'Jimmy' Peng, 35, is the story of an entrepreneur who flew too
high and was brought down by a Chinese legal system still secretive in its
methods and primitive in its treatment of suspects.
For a time Mr Peng was a local hero. His company Champaign, a textile,
property and trading group, was the first Sino-foreign joint venture listed
on a Chinese stock exchange. In 1991 he almost pulled off the HKDollars
1.14bn (Pounds 96.6m) sale of his controlling interest in Champaign to
Lolliman, a Hong Kong property investment company. But the deal came
unstuck.
And late at night on October 13 last year, Mr Peng was taken from the
Mandarin Oriental in Macao by the police and handed over to the Chinese
police, in an arrest which has raised international concern.
On June 9, after repeated demands by the Australian government for an
explanation, the Macao government said Mr Peng had consented to his return
to China to answer charges of corruption. But a spokesperson for the
Australian department of foreign affairs and trade said last week that
Canberra was dissatisfied with Macao's response.
On June 20, Senator Gareth Evans, Australia's foreign minister, wrote to his
opposite number, Mr Qian Qichen, expressing the Australian government's
'deep concern' at China's handling of the case.
Under China's criminal code a suspect can be held for two months without
charge, unless the National People's Congress, China's parliament, gives
written authorisation for an extension. On Thursday, the semi-official Hong
Kong China News Agency quoted an unnamed official from the Shenzhen People's
Procuratorate saying that Mr Peng's detention had been approved by the NPC
and was 'strictly within legal limits'.
Mr Peng's problems appear to relate to his ownership of Champaign.
In 1987 he acquired the loss-making Shenzhen Yuan Ye Textiles company and
the Shenzhen government approved its conversion into a Sino-foreign joint
venture with Mr Peng's Panco Industrial, a Hong Kong-registered private
company, owning 83 per cent of its Yn20m (Pounds 1.5m) registered capital.
This joint-venture company was listed on the Shenzhen stock exchange in
March 1990 as Champaign.
Between 1987 and 1990 Mr Peng appears to have performed wonders, with
Champagne's audited profits before tax at Yn31.4m in 1990. But he also
angered local officialdom with some deft financial footwork.
In July 1988, according to an August 1993 report by a committee established
by the Shenzhen government to restructure Champaign, one shareholder, Xinye,
a state-owned company, converted its ordinary shares into preference shares.
Xinye did this for an entitlement to dividend payments capped at a total of
Yn350,000.
Two months later Mr Peng revalued the company's assets. This increased Yuan
Ye's net worth by Yn25.7m and give Panco a windfall gain of Yn24.6m on its
investment.
The Shenzhen government's 1993 inquiry found that 'this action of
revaluation resulted in injury to the state.'
The first inkling that Mr Peng might be in trouble came in 1991 when he
tried to sell Panco (which then owned about 51 per cent of Champaign) to
Lolliman. Lolliman was well connected in China and was sold last year to the
People's Liberation Army and renamed Poly Investments.
But the proposed sale to Lolliman, unveiled in June 1991, fell through in
July. Lolliman cited complexities relating to the auditing of Panco's
interests in Shenzhen. Press speculation suggested the Shenzhen government
had intervened to stop the deal.
This was also suggested by Mr Peng in a letter he wrote to the Australian
consul in Guangzhou on September 28 last year from his home in Sydney.
By the beginning of 1992, Mr Peng says, he was negotiating with the Shenzhen
office of the People's Bank over the sale of nearly half of Panco's interest
in Champaign when first the Shenzhen government and then the People's Bank
called off the talks.
The central bank sent in inspectors and seized Champaign's accounts.
Champaign's bank accounts were frozen and the People's Bank stated that no
bank would be allowed to realise its security against Panco's mortgaged
Champaign shares.
This rendered unsecured loans that were previously secured. As a result, on
June 20 the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) sued Champaign in
the Shenzhen Intermediate People's Court for the recovery of a Yn20m loan.
The bank also alleged that Panco was not the legal owner of its interest in
Champaign in view of share trades which occurred in 1988.
The People's Bank sequestered Panco's investment in Champaign. Mr Peng
stepped down as chairman of both Panco and Champaign in an attempt to take
some of the heat out of the dispute.
On December 18 the Shenzhen court voided Champaign's loan agreement with
ICBC - even though Panco had paid off the debt before the hearing began - on
the basis that Panco's ownership of its Champaign shares was illegal. Panco
appealed to the Guangdong Higher People's Court.
At the beginning of May last year the Guangdong court overturned the
Shenzhen court's ruling. The court found that Panco did have legal title to
its shares in Champaign and could therefore use them as collateral for a
loan. However, it ordered ICBC to hand over the Champaign shares in its
keeping to the Shenzhen Securities Regulatory Office 'for further handling'
because the Shenzhen authorities had already decided to 'reorganise'
Champaign.
At this point Deng Xiaoping's niece, Ms Ding Peng, appeared on the stage. Mr
Peng says in his letter to the Australian consul that he hired Ms Ding - the
daughter of Mr Deng Ken, the younger brother of Mr Deng - 'to more
efficiently facilitate communications with officials in Shenzhen'.
According to Mr Peng's wife, Lina, relations with Ms Ding appeared to be
warm. Last week she said that her husband paid Ms Ding HKDollars 100,000 a
month and provided her with an office in Hong Kong.
In his letter to the Australian consul, Mr Peng says that Ms Ding and a Mr
Zheng Lie Lie, were hired to lead Panco's discussions with the Shenzhen
government-appointed Champaign Restructuring Group. In apparent defiance of
the Guangdong court ruling, Shenzhen proceeded with its restructuring of
Champaign in spite of the superior court ruling that Panco's ownership of
Champaign was legal.
In the midst of these talks Mr Peng discovered that Ms Ding and Mr Zheng
were attempting secretly to transfer Panco's shareholding in Champaign,
valued at HKDollars 450m, to a company they owned prior to its resale to
China Investments, one of Hong Kong's lesser 'red chips' (the mainland
equivalent of a 'blue chip' stock).
Mr Peng and associates immediately sought and obtained a Hong Kong High
Court injunction preventing the share transfer. However, developments across
the border were once again moving against him.
On September 5 last year the Shenzhen government convened a meeting of
Champaign's shareholders. Although Mr Peng alleges in his letter to the
Australian consul that a quorum was not present, the meeting voted to
confiscate Panco's shareholding in the company and divide it between
Shenzhen Municipal Development (Holdings), and Hong Kong China Project, a
company on whose board of directors sits Ms Ding.
Mr Peng immediately lodged a suit against the Shenzhen government with the
Shenzhen Intermediate Court but, to date, it has refused to accept his
application. Weeks after this suit was lodged Mr Peng was detained in Macao
and handed over to the Shenzhen police.
For corporate lawyers, the way local Shenzhen officials and others have
combined to confiscate Mr Peng's assets has caused alarm.
'The Shenzhen authorities have shown a flagrant disregard for the rights of
shareholders and creditors, which are the basic rights enshrined in all
company law,' says a Hong Kong lawyer. Furthermore, his case is cautionary
for ethnic Chinese businessmen who are nationals of another country.
The stakes were raised last week when Mr Peng's wife Lina decided to
publicise her family's relationship with Ms Ding. To implicate such a close
relative of Mr Deng Xiaoping's in this way could invite harsher treatment of
her husband. An adviser to Lina Peng agreed that it was a high-risk move -
'but it's been nine months that he's been detained and Lina has been through
most of the low-risk strategies,' he said.

FT  23 JUL 94 / LDP changes mind over N-arms rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's odd ruling couple yesterday showed conjugal give and take when the
conservative Liberal Democratic party agreed, for the first time, to take
part in a rally against nuclear arms, writes William Dawkins.
Mr Yoshiro Mori, LDP secretary general, said the party had accepted an
invitation from its new coalition partner and former adversary, the
left-wing Social Democratic party, to send representatives to the
demonstration in Hiroshima next month.
The LDP's gesture to the anti-nuclear left came two days after Mr Tomiichi
Murayama, SDP prime minister, made an unprecedented gesture to the
pro-military right by abandoning his party's belief that Japan's defence
forces were unconstitutional.
'The banning of nuclear weapons is a common theme among the people of the
world and, as the only nation to have suffered from atomic bombing, Japan
must be serious about this spirit,' Mr Mori said.
The annual rally, organised by the Japan Congress Against Atomic and
Hydrogen Bombs, starts on August 3 and ends three days later on the
anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. Until this year the LDP had
refused to attend, on the grounds that it was organised by the Socialist
opposition, with which it formed a government last month.
The LDP does, however, attend memorial ceremonies at Hiroshima on August 6
and at Nagasaki on August 9. Nagasaki was also bombed in 1945.
In another gesture to its left-wing allies, the LDP said yesterday that it
had shelved plans to rewrite Japan's US-drafted pacifist constitution.
However, Mr Yohei Kono, LDP president, said there would be no change in the
party's resistance to another Socialist demand, for better government
medical help for the 340,000 registered hibakusha, people of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki suffering from radiation sickness. The Socialists also argue there
are a large number of unregistered victims deserving state assistance.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Japanese PM seeks to allay Seoul fears
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's new left-wing prime minister, will today visit
Seoul to try to reassure South Korea that it can still count on his
country's support.
Mr Murayama's Social Democratic party has closer links to North Korea than
any other political group in the democratic world and formally refuses to
recognise South Korea as a sovereign state.
His tacit recognition of South Korea marks the latest step in the SDP
leadership's abandonment of most of its traditional policies, in evolving
over the past year from a party of opposition to one of government.
That process came to a climax last month when Mr Murayama became Japan's
first Socialist prime minister for 47 years.
The South Korean visit, the first since the new government took power at the
end of June, is the opening stage of a tour of five south-east Asian
countries over the next week.
Mr Murayama will be accompanied by Foreign Minister Yohei Kono, president of
the conservative Liberal Democratic party which is the dominant party in the
three-member coalition. The trip includes Vietnam - the first official visit
there by a Japanese prime minister for 21 years - Singapore and the
Philippines.
Mr Murayama would explain to South Korean President Kim Young Sam the
complexities of Japan's new coalition government and would seek to assuage
fears about his new regime, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said.
Japan's Asian policies were unchanged and Tokyo would continue to press for
a negotiated settlement of the dispute over whether or not North Korea was
illicitly making nuclear weapons, the official added.
Mr Murayama will continue Japan's policy of apologising for its war record
in mainland Asia and is expected to tell President Kim of a plan to spend
Y100bn (Pounds 653.59m) over the next decade on academic studies of war
history and youth exchange.
Mr Murayama's Asian visit comes as the yen's recent strength has increased
pressure on Japanese companies to shift more production capacity to cheap
locations in neighbouring countries.
Japanese investments in the rest of Asia rose three-fold in the seven years
to 1993, so that the region's share of Japanese foreign investment will
reach 37.5 per cent this year, according to government figures. This has
been accompanied by a sharp growth in trade, so that Japan's trade surplus
with Asia last year surpassed the gap with the US for the first time.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Clinton agrees healthcare stand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton and Democratic party leaders yesterday agreed on a
new strategy for the healthcare reform bill that would, the president
insisted, still meet his basic goals, including universal medical insurance
cover.
Only the most general outlines of the Democrats' thinking were immediately
available. But Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader, said: 'Our
plans will be less bureaucratic, more voluntary and will be phased in over a
longer period'.
Mr Clinton argued that the new approach, outlined after a White House
session on Thursday night, did not constitute a retreat as there was
agreement on the overriding objectives. These he defined as universal cover,
quality and choice of medical care, emphasis on preventative and primary
treatment, and cost containment.
He did not mention the controversial issue of requiring employers to finance
the lion's share of the insurance premiums of their workforces, but said he
had long been flexible on the details.
With the stage now set for the climactic debate in Congress, 'now is the
time for those with a better idea to come forward', he added.
Essentially, the president, Mr Mitchell, Congressmen Tom Foley, Speaker of
the House, and Richard Gephardt, its majority leader, were confronted with a
legislative impasse.
None of the bills reported out by various congressional committees commands
majority support, nor does the modest alternative reform plan offered by the
Republicans.
To deal with this, Mr Mitchell said he hoped to have a new draft bill ready
to take to the floor of the Senate by the end of next week. It will seek to
reconcile the large differences in bills already reported out by the Senate
finance and health committees.
The House has scheduled a vote in the week beginning August 8, just before
the summer recess. Although its version of the bill is likely to reflect
what has already been agreed by its ways and means committee, the House's
actions are also certain to be influenced by events in the Senate.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Raytheon secures deal to monitor Amazon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A consortium led by the US electronics company and defence manufacturer
Raytheon has won a Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 700m) contract to build a
technological surveillance system in the Amazon rain forest.
The Brazilian government rejected a French bid, represented by Thomson and
Alcatel, to supply and install the Amazon Surveillance System (Sivam).
A statement from the Brazilian president's office on Thursday evening said
the Raytheon tender was technologically and financially superior.
The contract includes the supply of radar equipment, aircraft and
communication networks, which will be used to monitor the Amazon for
environmental research, including deforestation, as well as for airspace and
border control and combating drug trafficking in the region.
The Raytheon consortium includes MacDonald Dettwiler of Canada, Westinghouse
Electric, the University of New Hampshire and the Brazilian operations of
International Business Machines (IBM).
It also includes the Brazilian government-controlled aircraft manufacturer
Embraer.
The Brazilian government will receive eight years grace on payment and a
further 10 years to pay for the contract, which will be financed by the US
Eximbank, according to Mr Esteve Ortis, president of Esca, the Brazilian
company coordinating the project.
Mr Ortis said that the financing proposals offered by both consortiums were
'unbelievably good.'
Brazilian companies, particularly Embraer, will be responsible for supplying
about 40 per cent of the contract value, he said.
The US and French bids were shortlisted in May after the government rejected
tenders from the US's Unisys Corp and a joint bid by Germany's Deutsche
Aerospace and Italy's Alenia.
Both the US and French governments lobbied strongly for the contract. Last
October Mr Gerard Longuet, French trade and industry minister, visited
Brazil and last month Mr Ron Brown, US secretary of commerce, led a trade
mission to the country.
The Sivam project is described by the Brazilian government as 'the largest
and most complex attempt to monitor the environment anywhere in the world.'
It will be made up of a network of fixed and mobile radar, aircraft and
satellite monitoring and a communications network.
The system will be controlled from the capital Brasilia, with centres in the
towns of Manaus, Belem and Porto Velho.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Caldera defiant over rights suspension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Venezuela's President Rafael Caldera yesterday suspended constitutional
freedoms a day after Congress had ordered them restored, according to
Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom.
Congress voted on Thursday night to restore five out of six constitutional
rights suspended on June 27 by Mr Caldera, overriding protests from the
executive. The original suspension needed to be approved by Congress.
But the president yesterday called a special cabinet meeting to discuss the
move, after which Mr Salom reported that he had decided to suspend the
constitutional guarantees once again.
Citing a critical economic and financial situation in the country, President
Caldera last month decreed the suspension of three civil rights and three
economic rights established under the constitution. The civil rights
protected against arbitrary arrest and imprisonment and ensured the
inviolability of a citizen's home and free movement in and outside national
territory. The economic rights protected the freedom to engage in any legal
economic activity, the ownership of property and against expropriation
without due process and indemnity.
In a marathon session of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, a
majority voted to restore all rights except that of the freedom to engage in
legal economic activity.
Three opposition political parties - Democratic Action (social democrats),
Copei (Christian democrats) and Radical Cause (a leftist group) - formed a
bloc to back restoration of the five rights. The two parties supporting
President Caldera, Convergence and the socialist MAS, walked out of the
congressional chamber during the vote.
Over the week, members of Mr Caldera's cabinet met congressmen to argue for
continued suspension of the rights. The suspension was also supported by the
military and security services.
However, opposition congressmen argued that existing legislation allowed the
executive sufficient powers to confront the country's problems.
Since the rights were removed, police and soldiers have raided scores of
food stores, arresting owners for alleged profiteering and confiscating
merchandise allegedly 'hoarded'. Police have also raided slum cities,
detaining hundreds of people suspected of criminal activities.
Officials have also seized property belonging to individuals and companies
linked to Banco Latino.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Ruling sets up passive smoking suit: US tobacco groups
cleared to challenge federal government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US tobacco manufacturers have won a court case allowing them to challenge a
federal government claim that passive smoking - the inhalation of other
people's cigarette smoke - can kill.
If the manufacturers' lawsuit succeeds, it will remove one of the most
important foundations of the anti-smoking movement in the US. Public and
private sectors alike have used the government's declaration as the basis
for widespread smoking bans in buildings and public places.
The government made its assertion in January last year when the
Environmental Protection Agency issued a report titled Respiratory Health
Effects of Passive Smoking: Lung Cancer and Other Disorders.
The report said passive smoking increased the risk of illnesses such as lung
cancer and it was a contributory cause of asthma, pneumonia and bronchitis
in children. Its most important conclusion was that passive smoking killed
3,000 non-smokers a year, and it classified second-hand smoke as a class A
carcinogen.
However, many smokers say the EPA was determined to show passive smoking
killed and manipulated the evidence to suit conclusions it had already made.
The two biggest US tobacco manufacturers, Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds,
have joined with four other tobacco industry plaintiffs in bringing a
lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency seeking a declaration
that the agency's risk assessment should be declared null and void.
They say the agency ignored its own scientific guidelines, overstepped its
regulatory authority, used faulty science and improper procedures to arrive
at its conclusion, and 'cherry picked' data by ignoring newer and larger
studies contradicting its conclusion.
The agency sought to have the case dismissed, contending their risk
assessment was not final agency regulation and was not subject to judicial
review. But a US district court in North Carolina this week threw out the
agency's case, paving the way for an examination of its conduct in court.
RJ Reynolds said yesterday it was delighted at the outcome and looked
forward to a full hearing.
'We don't believe that monkeying around with science to achieve a political
end is acceptable.'

Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, yesterday completed his third
Middle East shuttle this year, apparently without achieving a breakthrough,
but promised to return to the region soon.
He declined to reveal the substance of talks he held yesterday with
President Hafez al-Assad, the Syrian leader in Damascus. A Syrian government
spokesman said Mr Assad had 'listened to ideas' Mr Christopher had brought
from Israel on unlocking the impasse over the Golan Heights and had
'expressed readiness to discuss steps' to move the process forward.
As on previous visits to Damascus, neither Syrian nor US officials have
revealed the contents of what diplomats in the region believe are detailed,
but slow-moving negotiations between the two sides. Mr Christopher visited
Damascus twice during this week's initiative, which coincided with detailed
negotiations on border, water and security issues between Israel and Jordan.
Meanwhile, King Hussein of Jordan yesterday left Amman for Washington where
he is set to hold his first public meeting with Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's
prime minister, at the White House on Monday. The summit will symbolise
accelerated progress in Israeli-Jordanian talks.
Israel for the second time this week yesterday barred a member of the
Palestinian self-rule administration from entering Jerusalem, the Israeli
army said, Reuter adds from Jerusalem.
An army spokeswoman said Mr Mohammed Zuhdi al-Nashashibi, who holds the
finance portfolio in the Palestinian Authority in Gaza and Jericho, was
stopped as he tried to drive into Jerusalem from the Jericho self-rule
enclave. 'He (Nashashibi) wanted to enter Jerusalem from Jericho but he
didn't have permission so was told to go back,' she said.

Dozens of flights were cancelled and hundreds of passengers stranded at
airports yesterday as air traffic controllers in the Aix-en-Provence region
of southern France began a three-day strike. The stoppage, which comes on
one of the busiest weekends of the year for air travel at the start of the
summer holiday season, involves some 100 controllers at the airports in
Marseilles, Nice, Montpellier and Corsica. The strike was called following a
breakdown in talks over pay and working conditions. Only 100 flights left
Nice out of the usual 250. Some 1,000 passengers were stranded in Corsica
because of cancellations and delays. Flights to and from airports outside
the region were also disrupted because the Aix-en-Provence controllers cover
the busy routes from northern Europe to North Africa, Spain and the Balearic
Islands.

joined Russia in sponsoring the UN resolution welcoming the intervention by
3,000 Russian troops. Its adoption was facilitated by a change of heart by
Mr Edouard Shevardnadze, who now has asked for Moscow's help. Troops from
other former Soviet republics may join the Russian operation.

privately-owned Italian steel manufacturer, pulled out of a contract to buy
Eko Stahl in May. Mr Schode said Eko Stahl would receive DM50m (Pounds

told and he was 'not pessimistic' that the grant would be accepted by
Brussels. The Commission last month started proceedings concerning the

The South Korean government has decided not to intervene immediately in a
strike at Hyundai Heavy Industries' shipyard, which has emerged as the
country's biggest industrial dispute this year. The month-long strike at
HHI, which has resulted in sales losses of Dollars 240m (Pounds 155m),
stands in sharp contrast to the rapid settlement of other industrial
disputes this year as labour militancy wanes in South Korea. The HHI workers
are demanding a 12.6 per cent pay rise and an increase in other benefits,
which would boost wage costs by Dollars 1.3bn for its 22,000 employees,
according to the company. HHI workers are occupying shipyard facilities
after the company announced a lock-out earlier this week. Officials warn,
however, that the government could order the ejection of the workers from
the shipyard if the strike threatens to spread to other companies in the
Hyundai group, Korea's largest industrial conglomerate.

The German parliament voted yesterday to allow German troops to fight
outside the Nato region, by 424 votes to 48. The decision, which was
necessary to ratify the constitutional court ruling on German troops' role
in the former Yugoslavia, was opposed by the Greens and former Communists.
Mr Rudolf Scharping, of the opposition Social Democratic party, warned that
Germany should not always fight when called on by its allies, and that
German development programmes should not be replaced by overseas military
action. Defence Minister Mr Volker Ruhe said the high court decision 'isn't
a marching order' and denied that it would lead to Germany sending troops to
every trouble spot. Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister and leader of the Free
Democratic party, accused the SPD of retreating into a false pacifism. 'The
lesson to be drawn from the Nazi era is that violence can often only be
defeated by counter-violence,' Mr Kinkel said.

President Boris Yeltsin yesterday signed a decree ordering the continuation
of Russia's privatisation programme but made unspecified concessions to
deputies who had blocked the plans. The decree clears the way for a new
stage of privatisation in which companies will be auctioned for cash
following the completion of the sale of up to 70 per cent of manufacturing
industry for vouchers distributed free to every Russian citizen. But Mr
Vyacheslav Kostikov, the president's spokesman, said the decree,
necessitated by parliament's failure to adopt the second stage of
privatisation as ordinary legislation, took into account some of the
deputies' objections. Although he gave no details, the changes are likely to
give more leeway to local authorities and company employees in deciding how
companies are privatised. The decree is also likely to drop proposals for
the privatisation of land. After outright rejection of the plan for
'post-voucher' privatisation at the start of this month, parliament this
week failed to muster a quorum in support of the compromise version because
many deputies had already gone on holiday.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Latvia relents over curbs on citizenship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Latvia, the Baltic republic, yesterday bowed to international pressure to
give up controversial quotas making it impossible for many of its
non-Latvian residents to gain citizenship of the newly-independent country.
Latvia's Russian-speaking population increased sharply after the republic
was annexed by Stalin in 1940. Last month, the government introduced
draconian quotas for the naturalisation of non-Latvians born outside Latvia,
in a long-delayed citizenship law.
The aim was to stop Latvians being outnumbered or threatened by
non-Latvians, who today make up just under half of the population, as
opposed to a quarter before the annexation.
But international organisations such as the Council of Europe, which Latvia
wants to join as soon as possible, said Latvia had more democratic means at
its disposal to protect its national identity and security.
Following the Latvian president's request that parliament re-examine the
citizenship law, a new version passed yesterday is now likely to satisfy
Latvia's critics in the west.
The law still requires that citizens know Latvian (a language which many
Soviet-era immigrants never learned). But instead of imposing quotas on a
whole category of the population, the law seeks to prevent 'disloyal'
individuals becoming citizens by banning the naturalisation of any residents
previously involved with specific organisations hostile to Latvia's drive
for independence. These include such organisations as the Union of Veterans
of the Armed Forces of the USSR, as well as Communist groups or repressive
bodies such as the KGB.
It also for the first time introduces a one-year deadline for Latvian
officials, who have often been accused of arbitrariness and foot-dragging in
the past, to process naturalisation applications. The new law is likely not
only to speed Latvia's reintegration with the west, but to improve relations
with Russia, which is due to complete a withdrawal of its troops from Latvia
by the end of August. Possibly in response to domestic accusations that it
was too 'soft' on Latvia, Russia has suspended troop withdrawal from Estonia
until the rights of the Russian-speaking minority there are assured.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Rome budget revenue hurdle overcome: Legislation to
deregulate Italy's labour market allows for temporary jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Berlusconi government yesterday resolved one of the main issues holding
up plans to find fresh revenues for the 1995 budget - a pardon for buildings
constructed without proper planning permission.
At the same time the government has unveiled legislation for deregulating
Italy's rigid labour market that introduces for the first time the principle
of temporary jobs.
The cabinet failed to agree on the scope of the pardon on Thursday night
because of objections from the Northern League that it would afford a
blanket amnesty to many kinds of illicit construction and property
speculation. As a result the matter was pushed on the agenda of yesterday's
cabinet session.
The pardon, which will allow the proper registration of buildings and
conversions, is expected to raise L5,400bn (Pounds 2.2bn) by the end of
1995. A further L12,000bn is expected to go to the city and municipal
administrations concerned. It is estimated that up to 3m families could be
affected; but in the previous such pardon in the mid-1980s, less than 10 per
cent of the 8m requests were able to complete the required procedures.
The measure runs alongside an amnesty on a back-log of 3.2m tax assessment
cases expected to generate most of the L15,000bn in new revenues for the
1995 budget. The cabinet confirmed it would aim to cut the 1994 budget
deficit of L154,000bn to L138,600bn next year.
The cabinet also confirmed that key decisions on spending cuts in pensions
would not be taken until after the summer recess. Confindustria, the
industrialists confederation, while applauding the government's commitment
to reducing the public sector deficit expressed disappointment at the
postponement.
Confindustria also voiced reservations about the scope of measures approved
to regulate the labour market. The measures introduce the principle of
temporary employment and apprentice wages at below minimum rates. But since
they were first discussed a month ago with the unions, they have been
considerably modified.
The unions have managed to prevent a free hire and fire policy. Instead,
temporary employment will be circumscribed by strict rules. For instance,
employers can only resort to temporary employment where jobs are being added
to a company payroll - not in substitution for existing jobs or where jobs
have been shed. There are also limits on the number of temporary employees
per company - 10 per cent of the workforce in companies with up to 500
employees - as well as a maximum time span of 12 months.
The government believes up to 200,000 jobs can be created through the new
legislation. The unions are more sceptical. Much depends on how additional
incentives for job hiring in southern Italy, the worst area for jobless, are
applied. The draft law now goes to parliament and could be altered
substantially there.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Gonzalez tries to revive party's hopes: Will it be too
little, too late for Spain's ruling Socialists?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Felipe Gonzalez, leader of Spain's ruling Socialists, yesterday set about
reviving his party's political fortunes and to reinforce the moderate wing
as the dominant force in Spanish politics.
Mr Gonzalez, Socialist leader for almost 20 years and prime minister for
nearly 12, opened a gathering of party leaders to address the spate of
corruption scandals, the deep economic recession and the bitter divisions
within the leadership that together led to a humiliating defeat for the
party in last month's European parliament elections.
The prime minister will tell his federal committee that despite the
government's dwindling credibility, he intends to stick to his current
policies of economic stringency and to serve out his full term until 1997.
He will also continue to seek the support of the Catalan nationalists, whose
votes in parliament ensure an outright majority for Mr Gonzalez.
While there is optimism, mainly among the moderates, that Mr Gonzalez can
revive the party's standing, some believe he is doing too little too late.
Mr Joaquin Almunia, the party's parliamentary spokesman, said the meeting of
the Socialists' 212-strong federal committee would round off a slow process
of renewal that began when Mr Gonzalez narrowly won a fourth term in general
elections a year ago. This was reinforced in March, said Mr Almunia, when
the moderates emerged as a clear majority at the party's first national
congress since 1990.
Mr Carlos Solchaga, economy minister between 1985 and 1993, said: 'I think
Mr Gonzalez should change the government but it is difficult to see how he
can do that.' Mr Solchaga resigned as parliamentary spokesman in May when
the former governor of the bank of Spain, whom he had appointed, admitted
tax evasion.
The prime minister's unswerving stand on economic policy is a victory for
the party's moderates, the so-called renewal faction of moderates, of which
Mr Almunia is the party's chief proponent, and a defeat for the left of the
party grouped around its long-time deputy leader, Mr Alfonso Guerra. Mr
Guerra was deputy prime minister between 1982 and 1991.
Sticking to current policies means restrictive budgets to reduce the
deficit, instead of sustained public spending as the left would like.
Courting the Catalans, who are politically on the centre-right and embrace
the free market, means rejecting the Communist party-led United Left, who
are viewed by the 'Guerristas' as the natural allies of the Socialist party.
'The March congress made it clear that Gonzalez would adopt our ideas,' said
Mr Almunia. 'But renewal got held up by the corruption scandals, by regional
party congresses, where the Guerristas tried to fight back, and by the
European elections.'
Two meetings this month, chaired by Mr Gonzalez, of the party's 36-member
executive commission set the stage for the effective takeover of the renewal
faction of modernisers at yesterday's widened gathering of the Socialist
leadership.
Mr Almunia and his friends will formally take over key positions in the
party hierarchy and, crucially, the renewal wing will wrest control from the
Guerristas on the commitee that vets the party's electoral candidates.
In the post-mortem delivered to the executive committee on the European
elections, Mr Gonzalez concluded that more damage had been done to the party
by its erstwhile centrist supporters who had abstained or voted
conservative, than by those who had switched their vote to the United Left
ticket.
The message is to win back the centre vote as the economy recovers with a
mix of social democracy and market-oriented orthodoxy. Some doubt this is
possible, arguing that Mr Gonzalez has still to deal firmly with the left in
his party.
'When you have retreated back through the credibility threshold, and we have
unfortunately done so, it is difficult to walk through it again and restore
confidence,' said Mr Solchaga. 'There is a lot of 'Guerrismo' that has to be
brushed away.'
Another party member, within the renewal faction, put it more bluntly: 'What
is important is to get the Guerristas out before we lose the next elections,
as we assuredly will. That way they won't be around to take control of the
party when we're out of power.'

FT  23 JUL 94 / Fears of summer violence in Paris: Hot weather brings threat
of revived racial attacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The insalubrious suburbs of France's cities have long been prey to racial
violence but last week's tragedy at Dreux, one of the poorest outer suburbs
of Paris, sent shock waves around the country. Five armed youths drove into
a ghetto area and fired indiscriminately at a group of North Africans,
injuring 10 of them.
Dreux is already notorious for its high crime rate and social problems. Yet
last week's violence, which ended with one of the armed youths being shot
dead by the police, has fuelled fears that France is set for another summer
of discontent in les zups, its deprived suburban ghettoes.
'The Dreux incident may just be the beginning,' says Ms Sophie Body-Gendrot,
professor of political science at the Sorbonne in Paris and an expert on
urban problems. 'The situation in some urban areas is now at breaking
point.'
Fresh violence would be a setback for the authorities, who have in recent
years made progress in reducing unrest in les zups.
Summers have traditionally been difficult periods for France's deprived
urban areas. 'It's the time of year when tension tends to be at its
highest,' says Mr Henri Rey, a research fellow specialising in urban issues
at L'Institut d'Etudes Politiques in Paris. 'It's so hot, particularly in
southern cities like Marseilles, that people open their windows at night so
they're left fully exposed to the noise and promiscuity of living in cramped
conditions.'
The worst summer in recent times was in 1981, when Les Minguettes, one of
the most depressed suburbs of Lyons, erupted in a vicious race riot that
triggered riots in other cities, notably Paris and Marseilles.
Successive governments and local authorities across France have since made
heavy investments in trying to improve conditions.
Some of the old buildings, many flung up in the early 1960s to house North
African immigrants entering France from its old colonies in large numbers,
have since been renovated or replaced. There have also been efforts to
create youth projects such as training centres and special summer
initiatives such as extra sports facilities and seaside trips to keep
potential troublemakers off the streets.
'These initiatives have had a positive effect,' says Mr Rey. 'There's still
appalling poverty and violence in les zups. But the situation has improved
since the early 1980s. People then thought that the French ghettoes would
eventually become as bad as those of the United States. That hasn't happened
and there seems to have been less violence in recent years.'
However there is now concern that racial tension is rising again. The French
recession has made life even more difficult in les zups, particularly for
young people. The overall level of unemployment in Dreux is estimated at 15
per cent (against a national average of 12.7 per cent), but youth workers
estimate that it is as high as 70 per cent for school-leavers.
Further, the pressure on government budgets has forced the Balladur
administration to cut public expenditure in many areas, including urban
programmes. Local finances are also under strain as many authorities
struggle to repay the debts amassed in the 1980s.
As a result there is less money available for urban renewal initiatives and
youth summer schemes. 'It's impossible to assess the precise impact of the
cuts, but conditions in some areas have deteriorated and one gets the
impression that there's less for the kids to do this summer,' says Ms
Body-Gendrot. 'Is that likely to undo some of the progress of recent years
and to lead to more violence? Yes. I'm very much afraid that it will.'

Further evidence emerged yesterday of an acceleration in France's economic
recovery with a 2.2 per cent increase in manufacturing output in May
compared with April and of a 23.1 per cent increase in the number of housing
starts in the first half of 1994 against the same period of 1993. Mr Edmond
Alphandery, economy minister, recently forecast 1 per cent growth for the
second quarter of 1994, against 0.5 per cent for the first quarter, and
predicted that France would achieve 2 per cent growth in 1994 rather than
the original official forecast of 1.4 per cent. The 2.2 per cent increase in
May's manufacturing output contributed to an overall 0.3 per cent rise in
industrial production during the month, according to Insee, the state
statistics institute. Meanwhile, the 23.1 per cent rise in first half
housing starts, to a total of 153,600, according to the Housing Ministry,
boded well for the construction and property sectors, both been badly
affected by the recession.
Germany recorded a current account deficit of DM6.1bn (Pounds 2.5bn) in May,
wider than the revised DM1.1bn deficit in April, the Federal Statistics
Office said. April's deficit was originally estimated at DM1.8bn. Germany's
trade surplus contracted to DM5bn in May, from a revised surplus of DM6.7bn
in April and DM5bn a year earlier. In the five months to May, the current
account deficit was DM15.9bn, compared with DM14.2bn a year earlier, and a
trade surplus of DM29bn (DM15.7bn).
China's foreign exchange reserves rose by Dollars 1.7bn in 1993 to Dollars
21.2bn, the official China Daily reported. Reserve assets grew by Dollars
1.7bn in 1993, the report said, citing figures from the State Administration
of Exchange Control.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, yesterday disputed Russia's view
that the Bosnian Serbs had responded positively to the international peace
plan for Bosnia, Reuter reports from Zagreb.
Russia indicated it believed the Serbs had not rejected the proposals for
the division of Bosnia. However, Mr Perry said yesterday: 'It was not an
acceptance of the plan and that is what the contact group had asked for.'
Russian officials said the Serbs' demand for more talks was 'rather
positive' and 'not devoid of logic'.
'We considered it not a positive answer but a disappointing answer and it is
going to greatly complicate the path ahead,' Mr Perry said yesterday after
talks with Nato and UN peacekeeping commanders on military steps to impose
the plan.
A 'contact group' comprising the US, France, Britain, Germany and Russia has
drafted a plan to split Bosnia almost evenly between the Serbs and a
Moslem-Croat alliance.
'We would hope, sincerely hope, that between now and the July 30 meeting (of
contact group foreign ministers) that the Bosnian Serbs will reconsider
their answer and give them something more positive to work on at that
meeting.'
Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Siulajzdic said the time for talks was over now
that the Serbs had rejected the plan. Asked if there was any way his side
would negotiate with the Serbs over borders, Mr Silajdzic said: 'The answer
is no.'
Mr Perry was completing a week-long trip through southeastern Europe to
assess military options in Bosnia after the Serb response.
'It was very important for me to get an assessment from them on the
alternatives available at this stage. . . And it's important to understand
the implications of going down one road or going down the other,' Mr Perry
said.
The group evaluated steps both in case of 'the optimistic outcome' in which
the Bosnian Serbs embraced the plan as is, and the alternative of a
'negative reaction - the peace plan not being implemented' by Serbs, he
said.
The Serbs did not reject the peace plan outright but attached conditions
which would require substantial renegotiations. The Moslems and Croats have
accepted but refuse any further bargaining.
Mr Perry's talks centred on a possible increase in international military
pressure on Serbs to accept the peace plan - and how to implement any final
peace.
The contact group has warned Serbs that international sanctions could be
tightened against Serbia and the use of allied air power increased.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Ukraine decree to crack down on crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Leonid Kuchma,the new Ukrainian president, signed a tough anti-crime
decree as his first act in office, local newspapers reported yesterday.
Mr Kuchma's decree, signed on Thursday, was nearly identical to Russian
President Boris Yeltsin's anti-crime decree last month. In Russia, the
decree has raised concerns that new democratic freedoms are threatened, and
that the decree could usher in a return of the old totalitarian,
KGB-controlled state.
Mr Kuchma, who promised to crack down on government and business crime in
his election campaign, said the broad expansion of police powers was
necessary to 'strengthen law and order in connection with the extraordinary,
complicated criminal situation'.
The Ukrainian decree permits police to hold suspected criminals for up to 30
days. Hotels, dormitories and other places where the government believes
criminals gather may be raided without search warrants. Police and Security
Service agents are granted the right to seize commercial documents from
private companies. Half of the proceeds of raids on illegally-obtained
property would go into law enforcement budgets.
Crime has risen sharply in Ukraine in recent years. In the first six months
of 1994 alone, authorities say there have been 1,500 murders and 1,065 drug
raids yielding about 11 tonnes of narcotics.
A US FBI official, in Kiev earlier this month, voiced concern that Ukraine
was becoming a transit zone from Asia to western Europe in the international
drugs trade. He noted that Russian criminal groups exerted a strong
influence in Ukraine and often colluded with smaller Ukrainian rackets where
profits were to be made.
For Mr Kuchma, the decree serves to launch his presidency on a strong note
and to make good on his popular anti-corruption campaign promise.
In a further anti-crime move Mr Kuchma replaced the head of the Ministry of
Internal Affairs with a 46-year-old organised crime and corruption
specialist who has 22 years of experience in the Soviet KGB. Observers are
asking if this is an indirect attempt to merge the police and security
ministries into a single, powerful authority, as Mr Yeltsin unsuccessfully
tried to accomplish in Russia.

FT  23 JUL 94 / UK growth hits a 5-year high: Manufacturing plays leading
role - North Sea oil and gas perform well
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The strength of Britain's economic recovery increased in the second quarter
of the year, in spite of April's tax rises, as total output rose above
levels seen before the recent recession.
With the manufacturing sector playing a key role in the growth, the data
suggested that the UK economic recovery is becoming increasingly broad
based.
Gross domestic product grew by a seasonally adjusted 0.9 per cent in the
three months to June, compared with the previous three months, the Central
Statistical Office said.
Compared with the same period a year ago, second quarter output was 3.3 per
cent higher. This was the fastest level of growth for more than five years
and suggests that the Treasury's forecast for 2.75 per cent GDP growth this
year will be comfortably reached.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor, welcomed the figures as 'the sort of
recovery we want to see', not least because inflation was running at
relatively low levels, and unemployment falling.
'I intend to make sure we turn this favourable combination not into a boom
which goes bust, but into an upswing which lasts for many years,' he added.
The output figures benefited from a strong performance from North Sea oil
and gas, which accounted for nearly a fifth of the overall annual GDP
growth. Measured without the erratic oil and gas sector, output rose 0.8 per
cent in the three months to June, quarter on quarter, and 2.7 per cent, year
on year.
Nevertheless, the CSO said that even excluding the North Sea contribution,
output in the last quarter was now above the previous record reached in
1990, just before the recession.
In the City, analysts pointed out that faster growth might raise fears that
the economy was running into capacity constraints and fuelling inflationary
pressures. Encouragement was taken from signs that the recovery was becoming
more industry driven, after being largely consumer driven last year - not
least because trade figures earlier this week showed a steady growth in UK
exports to countries outside the European Union.
Mr Paul Turnbull of brokers Smith New Court said: 'At the beginning of the
year a lot of people were saying tax rises would weaken growth. In fact it
has accelerated.'
The manufacturing, energy and utility industries grew strongly in the last
quarter. The CSO said provisional estimates indicated that the index of
production, which covers these industries, would come in for the June
quarter above the previously established trend of 1.3 per cent, quarter on
quarter, well ahead of the rate of GDP growth. The transport, storage and
telecommunications sectors also saw strong growth, the CSO said. The retail,
hotel and catering sector - the only areas where firm figures are available
 -grew 0.6 per cent, quarter on quarter.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Mercury loses court battle to change BT's charging regime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercury, the largest competitor to British Telecommunications, yesterday
lost its legal battle with the industry watchdog, Oftel, to force through a
more favourable regulatory regime.
In a ruling with implications for the wider system of utility regulation,
the Court of Appeal dismissed Mercury's case without even hearing the
substantive points at issue.
By a 2:1 majority, the court supported Oftel's claim that it was not
appropriate for it to enter into the dispute between the regulator and
Mercury over the regime under which BT charges competitors for the use of
its network.
However, Mercury was given leave to appeal to the House of Lords, and there
were strong indications yesterday that it would do so.
Mercury had sought a declaratory ruling from the court on the interpretation
of BT's licence in order to pre-empt a decision on the issue by Mr Don
Cruickshank, Oftel's director-general.
Mercury's aim was to change the basis on which it pays for use of BT's
network from a per-minute system to a peak-capacity system more favourable
to competitors.
It was the first time a competitor to one of the privatised utilities had
sought to use the courts to influence the regulatory process. Lord Justice
Dillon, siding with Oftel, said the issue was 'firmly entrusted' to Mr
Cruickshank and not a matter for the courts to decide.
Ms Maev Sullivan, Mercury's director of strategy, said: 'The real issue  -
the price competitors must pay to deliver their calls to BT's customers -
has yet to be tested by the courts.'
Oftel welcomed the judgment, and said it remained 'fully confident' that it
had discretion to interpret BT's licence without judicial interference. The
decision to seek legal redress reflected Mercury's frustration at its
inability to persuade Oftel to change the regulatory system in its favour.
In recent months it has launched a strenuous campaign in the courts, the
media and with MPs to bring pressure to bear on Mr Cruickshank.
However, it has yet to achieve any success. Mr Cruickshank described recent
Mercury claims as 'shrill and unnecessary'.
Oftel is reviewing aspects of the current interconnection regime, and will
publish a consultation paper in the autumn. In addition to capacity-based
charging, Mercury is seeking to secure abolition of the special payments it
has to pay BT as compensation for the losses BT makes on its local network.
Mercury describes the payments as a 'tax on competition', a charge strongly
denied by both Oftel and BT.
BT would be free to carry entertainment services in some parts of Britain by
the late 1990s under plans to be unveiled by the Commons trade and industry
committee next week. It is expected to urge big changes to the industry's
licensing, franchising and exclusivity arrangements.  Report, Page 5

FT  23 JUL 94 / Greenspan helps dollar to rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Comments by senior US financial officials yesterday helped the dollar rise
to its highest level in nearly three weeks, writes Philip Gawith.
Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, restated his view
that a strong dollar was in the interests of the US economy. His remarks
followed an earlier statement from Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary,
that he believed 'very strongly' in a strong dollar.
The US currency closed in London at DM1.5955, nearly two pfennigs up on its
Thursday close of DM1.576. In New York it closed at DM1.598.
It was only modestly up against the yen in London, closing at Y98.72 from
Y98.685. In New York it finished at Y98.95. Dealers say the unresolved
US-Japan trade dispute, and Japan's large current account surplus, are
impediments to further strength in the dollar.
The week has been characterised by the concerted efforts of US officials to
persuade financial markets that they want a firmer dollar. The belief that
the Clinton administration was, at best, indifferent to the currency's fate
was one factor accounting for its recent weakness.
Analysts are reluctant to predict that the dollar's recovery will continue.
Most argue that action, in the form of higher interest rates, is also
needed.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Clinton launches massive aid effort for Rwanda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEREMY KAHN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday announced that the US was mounting 'an
immediate and massive effort' in Rwanda to help end what he described as
'the greatest humanitarian crisis in a generation'.
The US was finalising plans to establish a military base of operations in
Entebbe, Uganda, to serve as the central co-ordinating and staging area for
a round-the-clock airlift of medical supplies and humanitarian aid, Mr
Clinton said. US military forces would work to modify two existing airstrips
in Zaire, at Goma and Bukavu, to accommodate flights of relief supplies.
Mr Clinton said the US relief operation had two goals: to alleviate the
Rwandan refugees' suffering as soon as possible, and to secure conditions to
enable them to return to Rwanda.
Between 1m and 2m refugees, mostly members of the Hutu tribe, have fled to
Zaire in the past week to escape the advancing Rwanda Patriotic Front,
dominated by Tutsis. The RPF has just taken power in Rwanda after months of
civil war in which the Hutu government slaughtered thousands of Tutsis.
The US army will move immediately to secure a safe water supply for more
than 1m refugees living in the camp at Goma. Polluted drinking water there
is believed to be responsible for the outbreak of cholera which, Mr Clinton
said, was now claiming 'one life every minute'. The Pentagon would also
provide 20m rehydration therapy packages for the refugees.
In announcing the US airlift, Mr Clinton sought to rebut criticism that the
US response to the Rwandan crisis has thus far been slow and weak.
'The US not only supports the efforts of the international community, but
has and will continue to take a leadership role,' he said.
The US State Department was urging the United Nations to deploy a full
peace-keeping mission to Rwanda immediately, Mr Clinton said, adding that
the US would make the formation of an 'ethnically and politically balanced'
government in Rwanda a condition of US diplomatic recognition.
The US president said the operation would cost 'in excess of Dollars 100m'
(Pounds 64.5m) and involve the deployment of a 'moderate' number of US armed
forces. A White House official said about 1,000 US troops drawn from Nato
would take part in the relief operation.
Launching a Dollars 434m appeal for humanitarian aid for Rwanda yesterday,
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, said that nearly half the 7m
population had fled their homes. He said in New York that the Security
Council would be called into session within the next few days to establish a
tribunal to try to punish those responsible for massacres in Rwanda.
France yesterday ruled out keeping its troops in Rwanda beyond its
self-imposed deadline of August 21, despite pressure from the US and the UN
for Paris to extend its humanitarian mission there.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Japanese spending soars in line with the heat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Across Japan, Asahi breweries have moved to 24-hour production. Sales of
swimsuits at Tokyo's main department stores are up by 50 per cent on a year
ago. In the capital's electrical goods district, Akihabara, Tokyo residents
are buying air conditioners faster than shopowners can stock them.
The heat wave could not have come at a better time for Japan's economy. Just
as the rising yen looked as if it might choke off the recovery, soaring
temperatures have come to the rescue.
'Everything's selling,' says Toshiba, the electrical goods group. 'From our
latest high-tech orange-crusher to the home-made yoghurt maker - all thanks
to the weather. People have even got a name for it - the divine wind.'
Average daily temperatures were 3.6` Celsius higher than normal in the first
20 days of July. Last week in Kyushu, the temperature hit 39.6`C, the
highest since 1979. Since last summer was a damp squib, this year's heat
prefigures a strong recovery in personal consumption.
A summer-long increase of 2.4`C in the average daily temperature raises
consumption by Y500bn (Pounds 3bn), or 0.7 per cent, according to the
Yamaichi Research Institute. Applying the equation to current conditions
suggests a boost to spending this year of 0.3 per cent. Tax cuts - which
come into effect this month - are also lifting demand.
Sales of beer have soared along with the mercury. Every 1`C increase in
temperature pushes up daily beer consumption by about 900,000 bottles, or
2-3 per cent, according to one brewer. Asahi, the country's second largest
brewer, said a 50 per cent increase in sales had forced it to move to
around-the-clock production at six of its eight breweries.
Less intoxicating means of staying cool are also enjoying a bumper season.
Best Denki, the largest mass retailer of consumer electronics, said sales of
air conditioners were at record levels. On the hottest day so far, July 3,
it sold eight times as many as a year previously. Toshiba reported air
conditioner sales up 315 per cent.
Department stores, hammered by 22 consecutive months of falling sales, sense
revival with the soaring temperatures. Sales of swimsuits, hats and other
hot-weather attire are up by 30 to 50 per cent at the Takashimaya chain.
The warm weather has also come just at the right time for the country's rice
crop, according to a survey published yesterday. Bumper crops are expected
for the first time for four years - 10 per cent higher than average.

FT  23 JUL 94 / World News in Brief: Control of Blenheim to pass to trust
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Duke of Marlborough won the right to stop his son, the Marquess of
Blandford taking control of the family estate of Blenheim when he succeeds
to the title. The legal ruling allows the Duke to hand responsibility for
the estate, valued at more than Pounds 100m, to trustees. A statement said
the aim of the legal action was not to disinherit Lord Blandford, who in
1986 was jailed for three months for drug offences, but to protect the
estate.

FT  22 JUL 94 / International Company News: Saint-Louis in Spanish stake
talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Saint-Louis, the French food and paper group, has begun negotiations to
double its stake in General Azucarera, the Spanish sugar company, from the
present level of 10 per cent, according to Mr Bernard Dumon, chairman.
Mr Dumon has confirmed that Saint-Louis was in talks to buy the holding in
General Azucarera owned by Banco Central Hispanoamericano, the banking
group. If the deal goes through the French group would emerge with just over
20 per cent of General Azucarera, which has annualised sales of FFr1.5bn
(Dollars 279m).
The General Azucarera deal forms part of Saint-Louis's plans to expand its
activities over the next few years. The French group, which made net profits
of FFr717m on sales of FFr34.16bn in 1993, is already a force in the
European sugar market through its Generale Sucriere subsidiary and in paper
due to its interest in Arjo Wiggins Appleton.
However, Mr Dumon said he hoped to double Saint-Louis's annual sales over
the next six years. He estimated that the group could currently afford to
spend between FFr7bn and FFr8bn on acquisitions, including FFr2.5bn in
surplus cash.
'It's highly likely that we will stage a significant acquisition as we have
in the past,' said Mr Dumon. 'But we must be patient.'
The proposed increase in the General Azucarera stake is seen as the first
stage in this expansion programme. Mr Dumon also envisaged establishing
Saint-Louis as a force in the eastern European sugar market with projects
already under way in the Czech Republic and Poland.
However, the chairman said that Saint-Louis might consider raising capital
by selling its stake in Danone, the French food group which recently changed
its name from BSN. Saint-Louis currently owns a 2.39 per cent holding in
Danone, which has a stock market value of FFr1.3bn.

FT  22 JUL 94 / UK Company News: ED&amp;F Man plans September float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ED&amp;F Man, one of the world's largest agricultural commodity traders, is
planning a stock market flotation in September which is expected to value
the company at about Pounds 450m.
Currently owned by 100 of its top managers, the company plans to raise
between Pounds 75m and Pounds 100m in new money with existing shareholders
selling no more than 15 per cent of their holdings.
For most of its 200-year history Man was primarily a sugar trader, but since
the 1980s it has broadened its food interests and built a large financial
services business. It is a leading trader in commodity, energy and financial
futures in London, Chicago and New York and one of the world's largest
managers and distributors of futures funds, with more than Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 600m) under management.
Mr Harvey McGrath, managing director, said the two sides of the business
fitted naturally together. 'Both are about managing market risk.'
Although it trades commodities as a principal, the company does not take
long-term positions and Mr McGrath said it had largely eliminated the
sensitivity of its earnings to prices.
Pre-tax profits jumped from Pounds 46.5m to Pounds 66.7m in the year to
March, with the contribution from agricultural products more than doubling
to Pounds 36.7m. This reflected recent investment in primary processing and
distribution of products from cocoa to nuts.
Although the company has a strong balance sheet the flotation should enable
it to obtain a higher credit rating which will improve its ability to offer
clearing services in financial futures.
It will also be able to redeem Dollars 60m (Pounds 39m) of preference
capital which was issued to Philip Morris in 1991 in part payment for a 45
per cent stake in the company which had been sold to its Jacobs Suchard
subsidiary in 1987.
The flotation, by way of a placing and public offer sponsored by Schroders
with James Capel as brokers, will value the stake of Mr Michael Stone,
chairman, at between Pounds 20m and Pounds 25m, while Mr Danny Rosenblum,
who heads the US operation, will have shares worth more than Pounds 30m.

FT  22 JUL 94 / People: Ligon strides out for Levi Strauss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Levi Strauss UK, the clothing manufacturer, has appointed its second female
general manager. Janie Ligon will take over at the start of next month from
her US compatriot Jann Westfall, who has done the job for four years and
returns to headquarters in San Francisco.
Ligon will be based at Levi's head office in Northampton, and will be
responsible for all its business in the UK and Ireland.
With the company for 14 years, her previous role was national sales manager
(womenswear) for Levi Strauss North America, covering the US, Canada and
Mexico. She has much deeply involved in moves to improve links between the
manufacturer and its stockists, both in terms of staff and technology. Her
aim was to manage and co-ordinate better the whole cycle from the
manufacture through to the sale of garments so as to maximise retail sales.
Levi Strauss hopes she can bring that expertise to its UK and Irish
operations.
Ligon has also worked hard on expanding electronic data interchange (EDI),
or the exchange of sales data between the manufacturer and its retail
outlets - seen as being an important trend in retailing for the 1990s.
She was previously director of operations in the US, and, from 1986 to 1991,
merchandising manager for women's jeans worldwide, having held a number of
posts in preceding years. Before joining Levi Strauss she was business
planning manager at Del Monte, and a management consultant with McKinsey in
Chicago. She has an MBA from Northwestern University in the US.
Ligon will be hoping to build on the success of her predecessor, Jann
Westfall, who has achieved an increase in sales in each of the past four
years in a difficult jeans market, and has done much to build up Levi's
brand image with the help of a high-profile, Europe-wide advertising
campaign.

FT  22 JUL 94 / International Company News: BBV expands despite 14% decline
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya plans to spend Pta15bn (Dollars 116m) opening 250 urban
bank branches in Spain before the end of next year despite a 14 per cent
first-half fall in its net consolidated profit.
The expansion, which will lift the group's network to nearly 3,000 branches,
indicates BBV's ambitions to keep a strong share of the domestic deposit
base despite its failure to outbid Banco Santander in the auction for
Banesto, the fourth-ranked Spanish bank, last April.
BBV's six-month profit fall to Pta38.3bn was blamed on exceptional bond
market losses that analysts estimated could have touched Pta50bn. The
group's core banking business, in contrast, showed a healthy 6.2 per cent
rise to Pta220.9bn in its net interest margin.
Spending restraints which kept personnel costs to a rise of 0.8 per cent and
brought overall expenditure down by 0.3 per cent allowed the group to
increase its operating income by 18 per cent to Pta87.3bn.
BBV expects to recover part of its debt market losses, and also loan
provisions, in the second half of this year and is confident that it will
post similar year-end results to 1993 when its net profits rose by 2.3 per
cent to Pta71bn.

FT  22 JUL 94 / International Company News: Norwegian shipowner cuts
forecast after halfway slide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leif Hoegh, one of Norway's top shipowners, has reduced its forecast for
1994 after first half profits after financial items slumped to NKr129m
(Dollars 19m) from NKr213m.
The company blamed a weaker contribution from its car carrying activities
and a bigger-than-expected loss at Cool Carriers, a newly-acquired
refrigerated cargo operation. It also said that a dry-docking programme for
some of its liner vessels had taken more time than anticipated.
The group expects profits after financial items of around NKr200m for the
full year, NKr100m less than earlier forecast. Net profits are expected to
be NKr250m.
First-half freight revenues expanded to NKr1.46bn from NKr1.22bn, but
operating profits fell to NKr76m from NKr176m. Net profits were NKr142m,
compared with NKr339m. However, the 1993 figure included a NKr258m profit
from the sale of two car carriers.
Hoegh's second quarter profit after financial items was NKr36m on freight
revenues of NKr740m. Net profit was NKr48m.

<TEXT>
Outokumpu, the Finnish mining and metals group, has raised ADollars 22m
(USDollars 16m) from the sale of minority stakes in three Australian base
metal ventures to Pancontinental Mining.
The disposals are in line with the group's strategy of rationalising its
minority interests. Proceeds will be used to develop its other Australian
activities, including the Forrestania and Honeymoon Well nickel projects in
western Australian and the Panorama zinc project in the Pilbara region of
western Australia.
The main transaction involves the sale of Outokumpu's 25 per cent stake in
the Thalanga zinc, lead and copper mine in Queensland. The Finnish group is
also selling a 25 per cent stake in Mt Windsor, an exploration project, and
a 24 per cent stake in Lady Loretta, an undeveloped zinc resource.
Pancontinental aims to end up with 100 per cent control of all three
projects, after separately buying out another joint venture partner. The
Australian group says the total cost of the moves will be ADollars 42m.

<TEXT>
A Japanese court gave two former officials of a construction company
suspended prison terms yesterday for bribing a regional governor to win a
contract, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
The Tokyo district court verdict was the first conviction of executives in a
string of construction scandals. More than a dozen officials from various
companies and several local government leaders have been arrested on
suspicion of corruption since last year.
The Tobishima executives were found guilty of handing Y10m (Dollars 101,300)
to Fujio Takeuchi, then governor of Ibaraki Prefecture, at a Tokyo
restaurant on January 25, 1991.
The money was in return for Takeuchi granting Tobishima part of a Y38bn dam
project at Oyama near Tokyo, the court said.
Sukemasa Uera, 86, former honourary chairman of Tobishima, was given a
suspended prison term of two years. His son Soichiro Uera, 59, former
vice-president, was sentenced to one year and six months, also suspended.
Presiding Judge Kenjiro Tao said their criminal liability was serious, given
the effects of their action on society. But he said the sentences were
suspended because the two men had repented.
Mr Takeuchi, 76, is being tried separately.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Nigeria moves closer to deal with oil strikers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nigeria's military government appears ready to seek a compromise on the
industrial and pay demands of striking oil workers if they drop their
political demands and return to work.
In a meeting in Lagos scheduled for today, Mr Umaru Baba, the junior oil
minister, will meet representatives of both the main unions and the
operating companies.
The government hopes that by satisfying the unions' economic and industrial
demands, they will end their two-week strike and await a solution to the
political crisis.
There were signs at a meeting with the government and employers on Wednesday
that the junior workers union, Nupeng, was willing to end the strike in
return for settlement of two pay disputes with employers, information on the
whereabouts of their general secretary Mr Frank Kokori, and assurances that
the government will restore oil industry investment and move quickly towards
democratic rule.
Nupeng provisionally agreed to pay offers on Wednesday. The union, whose
members have received no pay since the strike began, appeared to soften
their stance and said they would consider returning to work if the oil
companies attended today's meeting and confirmed that government was
increasing investment.
The senior staff association, Pengassan, said yesterday it would attend the
meeting if invited but would not compromise on either its political or
economic demands. Pengassan insisted that the dispute could be resolved only
by meeting the head of state, General Sani Abacha.
The strikers are demanding that the military leave government and make way
for Mr Moshood Abiola, widely regarded as the winner of last year's annulled
presidential election, who is in prison facing treason charges for declaring
himself president last month. Mr Abiola's trial is due to start on July 28
in Abuja.
The strikers are also protesting against the government's under-investment
in the oil industry, which has led to payment arrears to the multinational
oil companies in Nigeria of about Dollars 700m throughout this year,
plunging the industry into recession.
The oil companies operate joint ventures, which are 60 per cent owned by the
government. They have sharply reduced development and exploration and, until
the strike, were investing only in activities essential to production.

FT  22 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Boots upset Airways alert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A disappointing agm statement, together with a large technical sell
programme, sent drugs and retail outfit Boots tumbling. The stock later
rallied, but still finished a busy session 13 1/2 down at 522p, having
touched 511p at one stage. Turnover was a weighty 8.1m, the highest this
year.
Boots' first-quarter high street retail sales came in below market
expectations, as did a 5.6 per cent decline at Do It All, the home
improvement business. But it was the lack of news on the expected sale of
the group's drugs division which caused most disappointment among analysts,
who accelerated this week's trickle of downgrades in anticipation of the
event.
However, although specialists expect the sale - which is likely to fetch up
to Pounds 1bn - to be earnings dilutive, some believe this may be offset by
a Pounds 500m special dividend from the cash-rich company.
Boots' Do It All partner WH Smith slipped 7 to 473p, as stores analysts
predicted the need for a further cash injection for the troubled business.
B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher, 18 weaker at one point yesterday, recovered to end the
day only a penny adrift at 501p after 4.6m traded.
Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome saw its share price marked down sharply as
dealers anticipated heavy profit-taking following the announcement of
interim figures restated to adjust to a calendar year-end.
The exceptional charge of Pounds 58m was slightly higher than anticipated
and sales of Retrovir, the anti-Aids treatment, were down 16 per cent as a
result of the findings of last year's Concorde trial. The company also
stamped firmly on recent takeover or merger speculation which had added
around 50p to the share price.
However, profits rose 12 per cent to Pounds 182m over four months and sales
of Zovirax, the herpes treatment and Wellcome's best-selling drug, rose 15
per cent over 10 months. The shares clawed their way back from being 17 down
to close 10 off at 605p.
News and electronic information group Reuters Holdings fell 9 to 467p in
spite of the stronger dollar, which would tend to support the shares of
internationally traded stocks. Bemusement increased when dealers noticed the
shares remained weak even after some large lines of stock were placed at
475p. It appeared that Goldman Sachs might have been selling actively via
the inter-dealer broker system. Turnover was unusually heavy at 8.2m shares.
The regional electricity companies (recs) were again prominent as investors'
appetites continued to be whetted in advance of the regulatory review
expected early next month. Eastern forged ahead 26 to 640p, East Midlands 16
to 623p, Midlands 19 to 640p, Manweb 20 to 713p and Yorkshire 24 1/2 to 626
1/2 p.
Mr Andrew Wheeler at NatWest Securities said he believed the recs still had
an upside of a further 10 per cent in the run-up to the review and beyond.
'The review will be harsh, but the companies will be able to cope with that.
We are still predicting 6 per cent real dividend growth for the rest of the
decade.'
A second profits warning from Shoprite in as many months saw the shares lose
half their value to close at 30p.
Brewer and retailer Whitbread slid 9 to 543p. The company was said to be
denying foreign press reports that it was negotiating to buy Swiss company
Moevenpick, a restaurant and hotel group.
British Steel hardened 2 to 158 1/2 p with 11m shares traded as the market
appreciated news that the company is to raise its prices for strip and plate
products in September. British Aerospace benefited from a recommendation by
several brokers to switch from Rolls-Royce into BAe. The former gained 11 to
505p, while the latter held at 192 1/2 p.
Recommendations from Kleinwort Benson and BZW boosted conglomerate Tomkins 8
to 231p.
Biotechnology company Celltech jumped 18 to 209p on news that it will
collaborate with Merck, of the US, on asthma treatment.
Speciality chemicals group W. Canning gained 16 at 194p after the company
announced a Pounds 9.2m disposal.

FT  22 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Airways alert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turnover in British Airways rose to a hefty 12m to make it the day's most
heavily traded stock as the shares relinquished 3 to 431p on fears of
increased losses at USAir and state aid for a European rival.
BA holds a 24.6 per cent stake in USAir, which reported improved
second-quarter net profits late on Wednesday. However, sentiment was hit
yesterday by a press report suggesting that the higher profits disguised
'its dreadful plight'.
Further concern arose from reports that the European Commission was about to
agree a state aid package for rival Air France of about FF20bn, around 60
per cent of BA's market value, a move seen by some as distorting
competition.
Mr Zafar Khan at Strauss Turnbull said, however, that BA had little to fear
from stiffer competition since 'it is one of the lowest cost airlines in
Europe'.

FT  22 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Billiton news expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Traders scrambled for Shell Transport as a shortage of stock was compounded
by strong speculation that the long awaited Dollars 1bn sale of the
company's metals business might be no more than days away.
Negotiations over the sale of Shell's Billiton metals business in South
Africa to Gencor have hung over the market for more than a year. A further
delay was announced at the beginning of July.
Yesterday the company's official comment was: 'We are expecting a conclusion
to the deal shortly.' But insiders said they believed it would be signed by
the end of next week.
Ms Irene Himona, oils analyst from SGST, said: 'It looks like they are
getting their act together on rationalisation. They will get rid of a
loss-making division and can reinvest elsewhere.' She added that although it
was too early to adjust forecasts, successful use of the cash could add
Pounds 150m to profits.
Meanwhile, dealers said a line of shares bought as part of a programme trade
early in the day added to the pressure and prompted some traders to buy back
stock and close out bear positions.
There was also support from an upbeat recommendation by Nomura early in the
week. The shares jumped 14 to 736p on active turnover of 5.6m.

FT  22 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Strong close as the Footsie
challenges 3,100 - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The currency markets came to the rescue of a lethargic UK equity sector
yesterday. Dollar stocks rose sharply late in the session as the US currency
turned higher after the US Treasury Secretary told Congress that the Clinton
administration wanted a strong dollar and recognised that a renewed drop in
the currency could threaten global recovery.
The FT-SE 100 Index, which had moved uncertainly earlier as the Bundesbank
left key interest rates unchanged, made a determined, albeit finally
unsuccessful, run for the 3,100 hurdle in the final hour of trading. Shell
Transport, British Petroleum, Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham were all in
demand - even though Wall Street was a shade easier at the London close.
The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 just off the day's best at 3,095.1
for an advance on the session of 17.9 points. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index gained
13.9 at 3,600.9 as optimism spread beyond the dollar stock sectors.
For most of the day share prices moved erratically, with company trading
statements providing many of the features. At the opening, markets in London
were under the shadow of the overnight setback on Wall Street, and the
concern over US interest rates revived on Wednesday by the appearance before
Congress of Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
A weak start saw the market down by 16 points on the Footsie and although
some recovery was soon made, shares drifted off again after the Bundesbank
left its key rates unchanged at its last meeting before the summer recess.
Markets were pleased to hear that the Bundesbank was not easing its
anti-inflation stance, although this did little to ease the renewed
uncertainty over global interest rate prospects.
Company trading statements gave a somewhat negative lead to the market.
Wellcome shares fell sharply in spite of higher profits as investors shied
away from the disclosure of lower sales of Retrovir, the group's widely
known anti-Aids treatment. Boots, the high street retailer and chemist, also
gave ground as the annual meeting brought no news on plans to sell the
pharmaceuticals divisions.
Outside these special situations, trading volume was thin and the market
lacked enthusiasm, or even direction. Little attention was paid to the
announcement that Britain's trade deficit with non-EU countries had dipped
to Pounds 495m in June, compared with market forecasts of a Pounds 700m plus
deficit. Nor was the market greatly interested in the outcome of the
leadership elections of the UK opposition Labour party, or in the reshuffle
of the Conservative government.
It was left to the upswing in the dollar to provide the impetus behind the
late improvement in the London stock market. Trading volume increased as the
Footsie moved steadily into positive territory. By the end of dealing, Seaq
volume stood at 607.6m shares, still well short of the 679.7m of the
previous session. On Wednesday, retail, or customer, business was worth
Pounds 1.57bn, again at the high end of this year's daily averages.
The September contract on the Footsie gave the lead to equities, and futures
trading served to strengthen the boost given to business in the Footsie 100
stocks by the gain in the dollar. Half of yesterday's equity business was in
Footsie-listed stocks, with the non-Footsie sectors playing a less active
role than of late.
Strategists, while commenting that the market was showing signs of moving
into its summer lethargy, saw the late advance in share prices as an
indication of underlying confidence. Any prolonged recovery in the US dollar
would be likely to inspire strength in bond markets, and provide the basis
for an advance in equities.

FT  22 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A firm opening on Wall Street, together with a squeeze in the second half of
the session, helped stock index futures reverse an earlier slide, writes
Joel Kibazo.
After opening at 3,078, the first part of the day was marked by a slide in
the September Footsie contract, with traders disappointed by the
Bundesbank's decision to leave interest rates unchanged. It fell to a low of
3,066.
But improving bonds, a stronger dollar and the good start to trading in the
US came to the rescue of September in early afternoon trading. James Capel
was reported to have been a good buyer, as was UBS. That strong demand
brought about a squeeze in the last hour of trading which saw September
advance to the day's peak of 3,120.
Profit-taking in the closing minutes saw the contract finish at 3,114, up 38
from its previous close and around 12 points above its fair value premium to
cash of around 6 points. Volume was 13,314 lots.
Turnover in traded options improved to 34,612 contracts from Wednesday's
27,216. Among the index options, the FT-SE 100 option saw 8,193 lots
transacted and the Euro FT-SE 3,122.
Hanson was the busiest stock option with 5,059 lots dealt. It was followed
by Lasmo at 3,852 and Shell at 2,571. Ladbroke and British Gas were also
busy.

FT  22 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): IBM results lend support to
the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
The focus of US equity investors shifted back to corporate profitability
yesterday and they were rewarded with a pleasant surprise from IBM, writes
Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 5.18 firmer at 3,732.45. The more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 1.01 at 452.61 even though
declining issues on the Big Board outnumbered advances in brisk trading of
290.8m shares. The Nasdaq composite added 2.26 at 715.03.
After a session rattled by fresh uncertainty over interest rates, investors
started to concentrate again on how companies performed in the second
quarter, amid the pressure of a tightening monetary policy. There was enough
favourable news on offer to allow the market to reverse its slide and post a
slim gain in spite of misgivings over the economic fundamentals.
On Wednesday, Federal Reserve chairman Mr Alan Greenspan had triggered a
21-point decline in the Dow industrials by telling a Senate committee that
it remained an open question whether the central bank needed to lift rates
again to squeeze out inflationary pressures in the economy.
Yesterday there was conflicting evidence on the effect of the Fed's more
restrictive credit conditions. The July survey of business conditions by the
Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia suggested that growth in the region was
moderating but prices paid by businesses were on the rise.
In spite of that unsupportive news, bonds were not a significant factor
influencing stocks yesterday. Investors in the equity market were free to
sift through a fresh pile of corporate results.
Among them, the most impressive performance belonged to IBM, which
confounded analysts by posting second-quarter earnings of Dollars 1.14 a
share, against forecasts of 73 cents. The stock surged Dollars 6 3/4 to
Dollars 62 3/8 in heavy volume of 8.8m shares.
The buying enthusiasm spilled over into other comp-uter-related issues,
helping to stem losses set off earlier in the week by weaker than expected
results from Compaq, Intel and Lotus Development. On the Nasdaq, Apple was
Dollars 1 3/8 ahead at Dollars 28.
Semiconductor stocks showed some strength, with Texas Instruments up Dollars
1 1/8 to Dollars 77 3/4 and Allied Materials 1 7/8 better at Dollars 44.
Among the blue chips, however, the upturn in IBM's share price was partially
offset by a sharp downturn in the value of United Technologies' stock. It
dropped 5 per cent, or Dollars 3 3/8 , to Dollars 63 even though the
company's earnings had improved 32 per cent in the quarter.
In other Dow industrial issues, Caterpillar disappointed the market with its
second-quarter performance and fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 106 3/8 . But
Sears Roebuck, which dipped on the release of its results the previous day,
rallied Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 47 3/8 .
QVC slipped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 44 1/4 after Comcast joined Liberty
Media in a Dollars 44 a share all-cash offer for the home-shopping network.
The combined bid, which sweetens an earlier offer by Comcast of Dollars 44 a
share in cash and stock, reduced the likelihood that a rival suitor would
emerge.
Canada
Toronto ended moderately lower in a session dominated by the release of
second-quarter financial results by some of Canada's largest companies.
The TSE 300 index receded 9.1 points to 4,172.6. Falls led rises by 385 to
307 and volume was light at 41.4m shares.
DuPont Canada, whose 'A' shares gained CDollars  3/4 at CDollars 18 1/4 ,
said net income rose to 49 cents a share in the second quarter from 31 cents
a year earlier. Imperial Oil shed CDollars  3/8 to CDollars 40 1/2 on poorer
second-quarter and six-month results.
Mexico
Equities closed almost 1 per cent higher, the first gain in five sessions,
on the back of a rebound in bellwether shares of telephone monopoly
Telefonos de Mexico SA (Telmex), whose 'L' shares gained 1.5 per cent at 9.4
new pesos. The IPC index put on 21.86 at 2,232.81.
Brazil
Shares in Sao Paulo closed off 0.5 per cent in light trade as investors
remained worried about liquidity problems in the banking system. The Bovespa
index dipped 201 to 40,185.
Brokers said there were rumours that some financial institutions were facing
difficulties in liquidating fixed-income operations, in spite of the central
bank's reduction in the discount rate late on Wednesday.

FT  22 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Late strength in dollar helps
underpin bourses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank's decision not to make any movement on the discount and
Lombard rates should have come as no surprise to the markets and, in the
event, most of them remained resilient. There was some satisfaction at the
announcement that the repo rate was fixed for the coming four weeks, but the
main cause for late strength was attributed to the rise in the dollar.
FRANKFURT saw the Dax index fall 25.35, or 1.1 per cent, to 2,113.30 in the
official session, which closed before the Buba went public.
In later trading there was a marked improvement as the index settled at
2,119.94. Turnover amounted to DM5.6bn.
BZW's global strategist, Mr Michael Hughes, said that with evidence that
money supply growth was coming under control he was now reversing his
recommendation for German bonds and equities.
Consequently, BZW had upgraded bonds to neutral from aggressively
underweight and downgraded equities from neutral to underweight. 'The
outperformance of German equities over bonds was facilitated by excess
liquidity coming into the German economy,' he said. 'As this withdraws we
would expect the relative performance to change.'
The banking sector was pressured yesterday as some investors became nervous
ahead of results due from Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank next week, with
reports that they could be disappointing. Deutsche recovered in Ibis
trading: having closed at DM721, the stock was finally a net DM8.50 off at
DM726. The story was repeated at Commerzbank, DM337.50 in the official and
down DM1.30 at DM338.90 in the Ibis.
ZURICH continued its recovery, with the day's half-year figures from Sulzer
helping to consolidate a more positive view of the corporate outlook. The
SMI index advanced 17.1 to 2,579.4.
Sulzer appreciated SFr20 to SFr905, with news that orders in the first six
months of 1994 increased by 3 per cent in Swiss francs and 6.5 per cent in
local currency terms proving better than some analysts had expected.
Nestle picked up a further SFr26 to SFr1,170 in continued response to its
better than expected first-half figures earlier in the week. The shares have
risen 6 per cent over the last two sessions.
Roche certificates continued their improvement, adding SFr50 at SFr5,400.
Their slide last week after disappointing figures had unsettled investors
and led the market lower.
Elsewhere, Brown Boveri, which posted strong gains earlier in the week, saw
profit-taking which left the shares SFr12 lower at SFr1,122.
AMSTERDAM moved closer once again to breaking through the 400 mark, the AEX
index finishing up 1.24 at 399.04.
DSM and Akzo made good gains, Fl 4.60 and Fl 2.60 respectively, to Fl 141.30
and Fl 205.20. Kleinwort Benson favours the chemicals sector, giving it a 36
per cent overweight holding in its model portfolio, although this is
substantially less than the 76 per cent holding it favours for consumer
goods, which includes both Polygram and Philips.
The investment bank said that these weightings reflected the 'cyclical bias
which we emphasise as being key for exposure to the European economic
recovery'.
PARIS recovered its balance after earlier declines, helped by late strength
in futures. The CAC-40 index added 10.06, or 0.5 per cent, at 2,053.78,
having dropped to a day's low of 2,023.11. Turnover was FFr4bn.
Eurotunnel claimed a 2.7 per cent rise, the shares ending 65 centimes up at
FFr24.55 on news that a US investment fund had lifted its stake.
Michelin, up FFr1 at FFr254, has been upgraded to 'buy' by James Capel,
which raised its forecasts, based on the view that new products were
performing well.
MILAN shrugged off the day's political tensions and edged ahead as it
awaited further budget details from a cabinet meeting after the market
closed. The Comit index rose 3.61 to 720.11.
Telecommunications stocks overcame early hesitancy which followed comments
by Mr Lamberto Dini, the treasury minister, who said there was no fixed
timetable for their privatisation. Stet closed L65 higher at L5,545, while
Sip was L75 ahead at L4,560.
STOCKHOLM moved very slightly lower on profit-taking following rises over
the last 10 sessions. The Affarsvarlden general index eased 0.1 to 1,445.2.
The forestry sector continued to outperform as rumours of further increases
in pulp and paper prices resurfaced. Stora moved ahead SKr4 to SKr400, while
MoDo added SKr5 at SKr345.
MADRID was unable to make any headway, the general index softening 0.06 to
304.34.
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya rose Pta45, or 1.6 per cent, to Pta2,950. On Wednesday,
the bank announced a 17.2 per cent fall in first-half pre-tax profits, but
analysts said the result did not look so bad if losses in trading operations
were excluded.

FT  22 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls despite
optimism on economic recovery

Tokyo, Singapore
Prospects of an economic recovery and expectations of buying by public funds
were ignored, and share prices lost ground on selling by investment trusts
and institutional investors, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average was off 157.84 at 20,622.92 after a day's high of
20,767.65 and low of 20,608.72. Volume came to 258m shares, against 310m,
and equities declined throughout the day amid a lack of participants due to
prevailing uncertainty over the course of the yen.
The Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 13.51 to 1,651.98 and
the Nikkei 300 lost 2.67 at 299.55. Declines led advances by 771 to 249,
with 167 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.86 to
1,337.88.
Investors did not react to Wednesday's Bank of Japan quarterly economic
report which concluded that the Japanese economy was headed for recovery
owing to rising consumption, fiscal stimulus and growth in overseas markets.
Meanwhile, the release of Y1,000bn in postal insurance money on Wednesday,
of which 50 per cent is expected to be placed into the stock market over the
next few months, also failed to boost share prices.
Traders said that while investors were still nervous over currency
fluctuations, prospects of buying by public funds prevented selling. 'There
is likely support around the 20,500 level,' said one Japanese broker.
High-technology exporters were lower on small-lot selling by domestic
institutions. Mitsubishi Electric dipped Y11 to Y698 and Sony Y60 to Y5,950.
Reports that utilities would continue to pass on the benefits of the high
yen by cutting rates hit electric power and gas companies. Tokyo Electric
Power, for instance, receded Y30 to Y3,000.
Hopes of increased capital spending boosted Komatsu, the construction
machinery maker, in the morning session. However, later profit-taking eroded
the gain and the stock, the most active issue of the day, closed a net Y8
down at Y945. Daifuku, a factory equipment maker, put on Y30 at Y1,360 and
Kato Works, a truck crane company, firmed Y8 to Y748.
Speculative trading supported Tomoegawa Paper, which rose Y80 to Y566, while
Oriental Yeast advanced Y80 to Y1,360 on the second section.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 120.73 to 23,085.08 in volume of 45m
shares.
Roundup
There was a mix of performances among the region's markets yesterday.
Baring Securities turned more bullish on Asian equities yesterday, Reuter
reports from Singapore. Mr Alan Butler-Henderson forecast that Hong Kong and
Thailand would lead a rally which could last between six to nine months,
based on chart analysis.
He expected the Hang Seng index to climb to 9,800-10,600 by end-September,
and to 11,000-12,000 by end-December; while he estimated that the SET index
would rise to 1,550-1,650 by end-September and to 1,700-1,850 by the end of
the year.
TAIPEI finished at its highest level since June 1990, with paper stocks
leading the rally, while plastics halted three days of falls to resume an
upward momentum.
The weighted index ended 103.40, or 1.6 per cent, up at 6,577.70, its best
close since June 7, 1990. But turnover fell to TDollars 91.5bn from
Wednesday's TDollars 105.9bn.
Papers led the gains on hopes of a rise in pulp prices, with Chung Hwa Pulp
and Taiwan Pulp both advancing by the daily 7 per cent limit to TDollars
48.40 and TDollars 38.30 respectively. Among plastics, China Petrochemical
strengthened TDollars 2.20 to TDollars 37.40.
SHANGHAI saw a sell-off of large-capitalisation stocks and the blue chip
Pudong which took the A share index down 3.5 per cent to its lowest finish
since early 1993.
The index dropped 13.67 to 380.95 in thin turnover of Yn237m, against a
daily average of around Yn1bn in the first five months of this year.
The A index has lost 76.8 per cent from its peak in February last year,
pressured by the rapid expansion of new listings and heavy issuances of
state bonds. In the past three months alone, the A index has slid more than
800 points.
In Shenzhen, the A index weakened 1.4 to an all-time closing low of 97.91.
HONG KONG had an initial fall cut back as a wave of bargain hunting pushed
the Hang Seng index back above the 9,100 benchmark. The index ended 71.16
down on balance at 9,117.66, after losing 160 points at one stage.
Much of the profit-taking was attributed to renewed worries about rising US
interest rates, while lower than expected Bank of East Asia results
accelerated selling.
Bank of East Asia retreated HKDollars 1.10 to HKDollars 32.30 after
announcing a 12.1 per cent rise in net profits for the first half of 1994,
compared with market expectations of a 20 per cent increase.
The news fuelled profit-taking in HSBC, which fell HKDollars 1.25 to
HKDollars 89.25, while its Hang Seng Bank subsidiary dipped 50 cents to
HKDollars 54.50.
SINGAPORE was easier as investors sold amid worries of higher US interest
rates, although the underlying mood was said to be still positive. The
30-share Straits Times Industrial index closed 22.86, or 1 per cent, lower
at 2,208.51.
SEOUL remained in the doldrums and stocks closed lower for the seventh
consecutive session, although low-priced small-capitalised counters, lightly
weighted on the index, attracted some interest. The composite index declined
1.32 to 935.35.
KUALA LUMPUR lost 1.3 per cent in a decline led by falls in Tenaga Nasional
and Telekom Malaysia. The Composite index gave up 13.36 to 996.36.
Tenaga and Telekom, which account for more than a third of the composite
index, fell 30 cents and 50 cents respectively to MDollars 13.10 and
MDollars 19.
MANILA lost ground for the second day in a row as investors continued to
take profits. The composite index ended 14.92 down at 2,648.54 in volume of
499.12m shares worth 772.8m pesos.
Metropolitan Bank and Trust was the day's top gainer, ris-ing 1.4 per cent
to 690 pesos.
Losers outpaced rises by 33 to 24. San Miguel, the country's largest food
and beverage conglomerate, posted the biggest decline, sliding 2.7 per cent
to 90 pesos.
PLDT and PNB defied the downtrend, the former climbing 1.3 per cent to 1,520
pesos and the latter 5 per cent to 420 pesos.
SYDNEY closed broadly lower, hit by weakness in markets elsewhere and
accompanied by a fall in futures prices.
The All Ordinaries index registered a fall of 29.4 at 2,049.2, after a low
for the day of 2,043.2. The September futures contract lost 40 at 2,057,
after touching 2,054.
Coles Myer ended 2 cents off at ADollars 4.29, after rising to ADollars 4.52
earlier. Brokers said the news that Kmart planned to sell its 21 per cent
stake in the company removed a long term problem from the share price.
Banks fell in line with renewed pressure on bond prices, with NAB shedding
18 cents to ADollars 10.96 and ANZ 17 cents to ADollars 4.09.
WELLINGTON buckled under the weight of selling from one large foreign
portfolio to close weaker on the day. The NZSE-40 capital index lost 18.74
at 2,036.20 in turnover worth NZDollars 157m.
Volume was the highest seen in several months, but brokers explained that
there had been a degree of duplication as a portfolio had been sold to one
Wellington-based broker, who sold to clients and on to the open market.
BANGKOK fell back on profit-taking amid expectations of higher interest
rates. The SET index surrendered 21.58 to 1,342.01 in moderate turnover of
Bt9.88bn.
Banks and finance issues dominated trading but most falls were limited. The
bank and finance sectors retreated 1.72 and 2.51 per cent respectively. The
two accounted together for Bt4.56bn turnover.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Buba fixes repo rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank council yesterday left German official interest rates
unchanged, but surprised the market by fixing the repo rate at 4.88 per cent
for the next four weeks, writes Philip Gawith.
By freezing the level of short term interest rates, the central bank has
allowed itself to depart for its summer recess without having to return to a
fever pitch of interest rate speculation. The council meets next on August
18.
The dollar held up well to the news, with analysts describing the price
action as noticeably more positive than recently.
The general consensus remains, however, that the dollar is enjoying an
upward correction, within an overall downward trend that remains intact,
rather than a reversal of the trend.
The dollar finished in London at DM1.576, more than two pfennigs up from a
low for the day of DM1.555. Against the yen it closed at Y98.685, from
Y98.76 on Wednesday. It strengthened in New York to end at DM1.5924 and
Y99.15.
The D-Mark remained little changed in Europe after the Bundesbank's
decision. It closed in London at FFr3.428 from FFr3.427.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, made clear that the purpose of
the fixed rate repo was to curb market speculation about the outlook for
rates.
Had this course not been followed, the next Bundesbank council meeting would
have been the subject of intense speculation about a fall in official rates.
With the repo rate currently at 4.88 per cent, 38 basis points above the
4.50 per cent discount rate, a few more weeks of 2 to 3 basis-point cuts
would have taken this margin perilously close to the 25 basis points minimum
which the Bundesbank likes to maintain.
Analysts pointed out that the council had essentially pursued a holding
action. 'They can go away and enjoy their holidays and come back with a
clean slate,' said Mr David Coleman, treasury economist at CIBC in London.
This was endorsed by Mr Tietmeyer, who said the fixed repo was not a signal
for rates in any direction.
Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at Bank of America in London, said the
move did not signify a bottom in German interest rates. Indeed, with the
Bundesbank signalling that it may consider changing the way it measures M3
growth to a monthly annualised change, the possibility exists that Germany
will see both M3 and inflation falling early next year (indirect tax
increases will fall out of the calculation in January).
Given that these are the two key monetary indicators that the Bundesbank
watches, there are grounds for still expecting lower rates.
Euromark futures traded briskly after the Bundebank meeting. The December
contract traded 50,000 lots to finish at 95.09 from 95.12.
The dollar had a better day in spite of the Bundesbank's decision to freeze
rates, which might have been considered bearish for the US currency. Dealers
attributed the improved price action to an absence of long term sellers.
Most investors with long dollar positions who wanted to sell had done so in
the course of the currency's sharp fall from DM1.67 to DM1.52.
Mr Hawkins commented: 'There are signs that, around the DM1.55 level, there
is a good deal of genuine support for the dollar. It is becoming more
resilient to bad news.'
Also contributing to an apparent shift in sentiment are the more explicit
statements of concern from leading financial officials about the dollar.
First up was Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, who evinced more concern
than previously about the weakness of the currency during his Humphrey
Hawkins testimony.
He was followed yesterday by Mr Larry Summers, the Treasury undersecretary.
Presenting the Treasury's semi-annual report to Congress on foreign
exchange, he said a firmer dollar 'would have important economic benefits
for the United States'.
Reminding the Administration that their sins of omission and commission may
have contributed to dollar weakness was no less a figure than Mr George
Soros, the influential American financier. He said nervous world financial
markets reflected a lack of direction and concern by leading industrial
nations. 'It is time for the authorities to pay attention,' he added.
Mr Mark Austin, treasury strategist at Midland Global Markets, said the
Administration was probably more concerned about the impact of a weak dollar
on domestic financial markets, rather than the level of the dollar in
itself.
The Bundesbank's rate decision spilled over into the futures market, where
the December Eurodollar contract slipped on the Liffe to 94.15 from 94.24.
Sterling continued its recent pattern of tracking the dollar. The UK
currency shrugged off a good set of trade data to close lower at Dollars
1.5375 from Dollars 1.549. It was little changed at DM2.4231 from DM2.4259.
The Bank of England provided Pounds 552m assistance to UK money markets
after declaring a Pounds 700m shortage.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Price surges lift LCE into
profit for first time since 1987
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Commodity Exchange made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1m in its last
financial year, which ended in March, after soaring coffee and cocoa futures
prices led to a 22 per cent upturn in trading activity.
The rise in business after two years of declining or static volumes led to
the first operating surplus at the exchange since 1987. This was paid out to
members as a rebate.
In the 1992-1993 financial year, the exchange made a small profit of Pounds
218,000, after recovering from the debacle in property futures which cost it
Pounds 1m in lawyers and accountants fees.
'When I got to the exchange, it was in survival mode because so many members
were going out of business and the exchange had overstretched itself with
high overheads,' said Mr Robin Woodhead, chief executive, who joined the LCE
18 months ago.
Six new members have joined this year, however, all of which are financial
institutions or their subsidiaries, reflecting the growing interest in
commodities among the banking community.
The end of the world recession and worries about the resurgence of
inflationary pressures have revived investment interest in commodity
markets. At the same time, frosts in Brazil, which damaged the coffee crop,
and a growing structural deficit of cocoa have underpinned price rises.
Coffee prices have more than doubled this year and reached their highest
level for eight years. The cocoa market has touched a 6 1/2 -year peak.
At the LCE, this has turned into a year of record volumes: in the last
financial year the exchange traded the highest number of contracts ever.
Mr Woodhead says the exchange's balance sheet is the strongest it has ever
been. It has reduced its overheads by a third to Pounds 8m a year, cut staff
levels by a third and pared back the number of contracts it trades from 27
to 13.
'We've decided to focus on our core products of coffee, sugar and cocoa and
direct our resources so that we provide as much benefit to those markets as
possible.' Mr Woodhead stresses he is not going to get carried away with
developing new products without the support of his members.
'Our history of new contracts is not very good, so we've reversed that:
we've got rid of soya, lamb, pigs, a redundant sugar contract.'
Instead of the razzamatazz often associated with the exchange when it was
called London Fox (standing for Futures and Options Exchange), Mr Woodhead
is concentrating on building a fully comprehensive statistics database at
the request of some members.
At the same time, the exchange has to demonstrate that it can operate
profitably in all market conditions. Its finances have been helped by the
upturn in its core markets, but it needs to break-even at much lower
volumes. The restructuring programme means the exchange now needs to trade
13,000 contracts a day to break-even, compared with 20,000 three years ago.
Mr Woodhead believes that the trading environment in the wake of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade settlement will increasingly free up prices
for agricultural commodities, giving opportunities for futures contracts.
But this could be a long time coming.
In the meantime, he is looking to upgrade the LCE's electronic trading
system to boost its capacity and is working with other London futures
exchanges to upgrade their common clearing system.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Albanian agriculture faces
struggle in the free market - The condition of the farming sector after a
counter-revolutionary land share-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF TANSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Albania, they joke 'What did you get in the land distribution? I got one
hectare and 10 bunkers'.
It refers to the many hundreds of thousands reinforced-concrete
mushroom-like defence bunkers built by a paranoid regime that finally
collapsed in 1991. They greet you on landing at the airport, dot the fields
and hillsides all over the country and take up valuable space in the tiny
newly-created private farms - average size 1.4 hectare.
Behind the joke lies a total transformation of Albanian agriculture in the
past three years, perhaps greater than in any other former eastern European
country.
Mr Daut Karamuca, an ex-wine technologist, in Babji village in the hills of
central Albania received 0.8 ha, scattered in several parcels, and one big
bunker (most are small, one to two person affairs) in the land
privatisation. He does not regard the bunker as an asset but makes the best
of a bad job by housing his eight sheep and seven goats in it.
A radical reform distributed the 70 per cent of the land formerly worked by
600 agricultural co-operatives to the villagers living on it and gave the
workers on the rest, in the 120 state farms, the right to farm it privately.
By law, the total amount of land associated with a village should be divided
equally among the inhabitants. Usually, each family got some good land, some
less good and some poor. In some areas, however, it was distributed
according to ownership patterns before the communist take over and disputes
still rage in some places over ownership.
Amazingly, Mr Daut says he has had a cow for many years - despite a law
passed in 1976 forbidding villagers to keep livestock - not so much as a
chicken. Everything had to be kept and managed in the communes' facilities.
When the old regime collapsed, most of these common facilities were smashed
up in a widespread, popular burst of anger at all that represented the old
order. The livestock were distributed to the 400,000 farm families created
following the collapse.
The transition was not easy, nor is it complete - land sales are forbidden
as titles have not all been given out. Yet, from being the most isolated
communist country in Europe, Albania has become perhaps the most ardently
free market oriented.
When the previous regime collapsed agricultural production slumped,
precipitating a major food crisis. The country's 3.3m people, with a 1993
per capita GDP of USDollars 330, received over Dollars 1.4bn in aid between
1991 and 1993, according to the Albanian Economic Tribune, much of it
emergency food aid - almost Dollars 700m in food and distribution costs in
1991-92 alone.
Agricultural production is climbing back up after a fall of almost a quarter
in 1990-91. By the end of 1993, some 16 different donors had agreed to
provide almost Dollars 238m in project funding to improve agriculture. About
Dollars 70m had been spent by the end of 1993, according to the 1993
Agriculture and Food Statistics of Albania produced by the Ministry of
Agriculture and Food.
The aim is to create a market-based food system. Everywhere, people have to
learn how to run a small farm business and have problems marketing what is
produced - as the previous distribution system has collapsed and few food
companies operate. They also need market information and more knowledge of
how to farm more efficiently.
Most farmers were workers in the old regime and have little if any
experience with livestock, for example, which are mainly looked after by
women. Reaching them, is essential to improve dairy production and village
cheese making, says Ms Rebecca Balogh, director of the small Land O Lakes
dairy development project. She and her team have organised some 260 village
women as volunteer key leaders, each of whom works with 15 women in her
village, to improve milk quality, animal health and cheese making.
In the mountain village of Guri i Bardhe in central Albania, Mr Hamid Murati
and his family struggle to plough their 800-square metre patch, They plant
maize for fodder while other villagers gather leafy branches from trees in
the surrounding hills for winter feed. Everywhere farmers harness up any
animal they can - horses, donkeys, bullocks, even cows - to work their land
as tractors are scarce and expensive.
Officials also face difficult adjustments. The ministry has been reorganised
with support of Dollars 3m under a UN Food and Agriculture Organisation
project. It now has to provide the kind of technical and market information
useful to small farmers through radio and TV, the only media to reach them.
An essential need in situations like Albania's is to provide business advice
to farmers, farming association and food businesses, believes Mr Sergio
Giorgi, FAO adviser to the agribusiness advisory unit. He is working with a
farmers association - 'co-operative' is not a politically-correct term in
the new Albania - established three years ago on a family basis, to set up
an accountancy system and financial control. He is also advising the first
wholesaler buying local produce and selling to transporters and state
agriprocessing plants, moving about two tonnes a day.

FT  22 JUL 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Currency developments have tended to push up some prices in the wool sector
in Europe. There is not only a small recovery in the US dollar, but a
relatively greater strengthening in the Australian dollar. European
adjustments also tend to push up pricing for individual firms. Apart from
this, there is some business stirring in the processing sectors. Orders have
been coming through erratically, usually for small weights at low prices,
but occasionally enough has been sold to have an effect on the prices one or
two firms are quoting. This can apply in the British wool sector, where a
good auction is expected next week. There was again good demand for
stockpile wool, and the monthly quota under the Garnaut schedule has now
been practically absorbed for July, August and September.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Latin Americans hope to heal
divisions over banana quotas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID SCANLAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN JOSE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Latin American banana producers, long divided over import quotas in Europe
and distressed over falling world banana prices, took a step toward burying
the hatchet in a day-long meeting here on Wednesday. Representatives from
eight banana-producing countries agreed to set up a working group and meet
again in Nicaragua on August 3 to end the dispute and try to boost banana
prices.
One of the options the group will be considering is a cut in production to
reduce supply and raise prices. The group will also try to improve
efficiency within the banana industry, officials said.
'We're optimistic,' said Costa Rican president Jose Maria Figueres, 'that we
can find a consensus position'.
Unlike the other Latin American staple export - coffee - bananas have been
floundering at 10-year price lows on the international markets. In the US,
banana prices have been hovering around USDollars 4.30 for an 18.14kg case,
the lowest in a decade. Prices were about Dollars 5.50 at this time last
year.
In Europe meanwhile prices are at 5-year lows of about Dollars 6 a case,
down from their usual Dollars 13 to Dollars 15 range. Producers blame
oversupply and dwindling demand for falling prices.
The falling prices have helped bring the Latin American banana producers
together, despite a bitter dispute over import quotas imposed by the
European Union in 1993. The EU imposed the measures as part of the Lome
preferential trade convention, under which the EU imports bananas from
former colonies of Britain and France in Africa, the Caribbean and the
Pacific. Producers in the former colonies can't compete with their Latin
competitors, who run more efficient, mechanised plantations.
Germany, Europe's largest banana consumer, has been particularly angry about
the quotas and filed a complaint earlier this year with the European Court
demanding a free market in bananas.
This year's import quota was 2.1 tonnes. It rises to 2.2m tonnes in 1995.
Four Latin countries accepted the quota system - Costa Rica, Colombia,
Venezuela and Nicaragua. The remaining countries opposed the limits,
including Guatemala, Ecuador, Mexico, Honduras and Panama.
But Ecuador's foreign trade minister Mr Diego Paredes said on Wednesday that
he was optimistic the that Latin countries could find common ground on the
quota issue in coming weeks.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia's aluminium exports as
high as ever
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia has trimmed its aluminium output but its exports of the metal are as
high as ever, according to statistics provided yesterday by trade delegates
at a meeting of the big aluminium producing countries in Canberra.
Nevertheless, those involved - Australia, Canada, the European Union,
Norway, and the US as well as Russia - pledged to continue support for the
voluntary agreement that aims to cut up to 2m tonnes from world aluminium
production for two years so as to bring the market back into balance.
Analysts said that outcome was to be expected as aluminium prices had risen
nearly 50 per cent from last November's 8-year lows. The three-months
delivery price closed at Dollars 1,532.50 a tonne on the London Metal
Exchange yesterday, and at that level nearly every producer is profitable.
The Anthony Bird consultancy group estimates in its latest Aluminium
Analysis that operating costs at western smelters are averaging Dollars
1,135 a tonne while Russian costs are Dollars 1,234. 'Although Russian costs
are rising, at today's prices even the Russians can make money.'
Bird suggests the industry has had 'an impressive success' in implementing
the production cuts but it expects no more of them. Neither does Mr Nick
Moore, analyst with stockbrokers Ord Minnett. He points out that the latest
International Primary Aluminium Institute statistics show the average daily
rate of production at western smelters in June was the lowest for 46 months.
'Currently the industry is operating at an annual rate of 14.174m tonnes -
an impressive 1.13m tonnes lower than the all-time peak of 15.306m tonnes
seen in December, 1992,' he adds.
Data released in Canberra show Russian aluminium output in June was 6.4 per
cent lower than in November at 220,800 tonnes against 236,100 - equivalent
to an annual cut of about 195,000 tonnes and well below the 500,000 tonnes
the Russians hoped to achieve by August. Russian exports in the first five
months were about 800,000 tonnes, equivalent to an annual rate of 1.9m
tonnes, roughly the same as in 1993.
The Canberra delegates warned in their communique that the aluminium market
balance was 'still delicate'. And Bird says: 'If aluminium prices continue
the torrid pace of recent weeks and anticipate too much too soon, the
recovery could fade before it has properly begun'.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries fluctuate within narrow
range
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury bonds fluctuated within a narrow range yesterday, influenced by
sharp movements in the dollar and conflicting interpretations of a regional
economic survey.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  1/32 better
at 84 13/16 , with the yield inching up to 7.54 per cent. At the short end,
the two-year note was off  3/32 at 99 27/32 , to yield 6.067 per cent.
Bond traders were keeping a closer eye on the foreign exchange markets than
in recent sessions. The fresh attention was prompted by repeated warnings
from Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, that a depressed US
dollar was a threat to the economy. On Wednesday morning, the central banker
told a Senate committee that the greenback's weakness could lead to higher
inflation by increasing the cost of imported goods and, in turn, domestic
products which compete with them.
With the link between the currency and bond markets reinforced, the dollar's
slide in the wake of the Bundesbank's decision to forgo a cut in interest
rates did not sit well with Treasury traders. Bonds slumped, but later
recovered as the dollar rallied on supportive comments by Mr Lawrence
Summers, a US Treasury undersecretary.
With the dollar's vagaries back at centre stage, the July survey of business
conditions by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia provided a fleeting
diversion. Immediately after its release at 10am, bonds lurched downward as
traders focused on a big jump in the prices-paid component.
However, closer examination of the survey revealed a pattern of moderating
growth in the region, mitigating the inflationary implications of the prices
data. That perception allowed bonds to move back to near their opening
levels by early afternoon.
Germany largely led yesterday's European bond market action, supporting
prices in most markets after the Bundesbank announced it was leaving key
interest rates unchanged.
Investor activity remained low, however, and is expected to become even
thinner in coming weeks as policy-makers and investors go on holiday. 'It's
been pretty dead in the futures and deadly dead in cash,' said a Frankfurt
dealer.
At its last meeting before its month-long week recess, the Bundesbank's
central bank council left official interest rates unchanged and set
fixed-rate securities repurchase agreements at 4.85 per cent for the next
four weeks.
After slipping immediately after the announcement, bunds soon recovered and
firmed significantly. The September bund future fell to a low of 93.48 but
closed at 94.08, up 0.40 point on the day.
The short end of the curve remained relatively soft on widespread
disappointment that the Bundesbank had only shaved three basis points off
the repo rate, most traders having hoped for a fixed-rate repo at 4.80 per
cent or less.
However, the long end was boosted by a sense that the Bundesbank was
remaining true to its anti-inflation stance in leaving rates unchanged, and
that it would lower them again on further weakening in M3 money supply
growth.
'Not cutting rates before the break leaves easing hopes intact, which will
support the market during the summer,' said a trader.
UK gilts closed little changed but up from earlier lows, pulled higher by
strength in the German market and by retail buying, traders said. The
September long gilt futures contract on Liffe ended at 103 3/8 , up  5/16 on
the day.
Today's attention will be on the release of second-quarter UK gross domestic
product data and the continuing Senate testimony of Federal Reserve chairman
Alan Greenspan.
French government bonds followed German bonds higher but underperformed them
slightly, allowing the 10-year yield spread to widen to 51 basis points from
46. The September notional bond future on Matif rose 0.12 points to 117.20.
Italian bonds ended a volatile and largely futures-driven session sightly
higher, boosted mainly by the strength in the bund market.
However, they also underperformed German bonds amid uncertainty ahead of the
Italian cabinet's presentation of its long-term budget plans after the
market closed. The Italian 10-year yield spread over Germany widened some 15
basis points to 399 basis points.

FT  22 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: Milan bourse plans stock
index futures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Milan stock exchange plans to round off its modernisation process with the
introduction later this year of stock index futures, a move which will bring
it in line with the rest of Europe.
The Italian stock exchange council and Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI)
yesterday signed an agreement enabling the transfer of the BCI 30 continuous
index of Italy's most liquid and highly-capitalised shares to the exchange.
Due to be re-named MIB 30, it will be the reference index for derivative
instruments in Milan.
Mr Attilio Ventura, stock exchange chairman, said a futures market was
indispensable for a well-functioning bourse. Trading is expected to start on
November 28 and will be conducted on Milan's 'telematico' screen-based
system.
Analysts welcomed the arrival of futures trading in Milan, which they said
would reduce volatility in the cash market and facilitate the hedging of
positions in Italian stocks. 'Investors will use futures to speculate rather
than the underlying stocks,' said Kleinwort Benson's Mr Enrico Ponzone.
Italian stock options will continue to be traded by open-outcry until next
spring, when they are due to be transferred to the telematico.
The change from open-outcry to screen-based trading has been at the heart of
the bourse's modernisation programme, which included investor protection
legislation and plans to shorten settlement from one month to five days.
Despite some initial technical difficulties, stock trading in Milan is now
totally on-screen and has greatly improved turnover, price transparency and
investor confidence, all pre-requisites for the Italian government's
privatisation programme.
Daily turnover reached L2,000bn in April in the aftermath of the general
election. Turnover has since fallen to around L1,000bn a day but is still
well above levels recorded last year.

FT  22 JUL 94 / International Bonds: Argentina targets Swiss retail
investors with schilling offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Republic of Argentina entered the Austrian schilling market for the
first time yesterday with a small eurobond offering worth Sch750m.
The three-year bonds, priced to yield 220 basis points over the 7 1/4 per
cent Austrian government bond due 1997, with a relatively high coupon of 8
per cent, is designed to appeal mainly to Swiss retail investors but lead
manager Creditanstalt said domestic institutional investors had also
expressed interest.
Previous eurobond issues by the Republic of Argentina have not performed
well this year, dealers said. The spread on Argentina's D-Mark bonds
launched last month via Deutsche Bank, has widened to 260 basis points from
220 basis points at launch.
In the dollar market, Federal Home Loan Bank System's global offering of
two-year notes was priced yesterday at 10 basis points over the comparable
Treasury yield, in the middle of the indicated range.
Lead managers Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley said around 60 per cent had
been placed outside the US, reflecting the success of international
roadshows in promoting the issuer, which has not tapped the international
market since the mid-1980s, to international investors.
Other dealers reported a mixed reception from investors outside the US, with
some saying that the spread of 10 basis points offered little scope for any
tightening.
However, by the end of the day the deal was quoted at 10 basis points over
on the bid side.
Despite predictions that the market is about to enter a summer lull, two
more borrowers are preparing large offerings.
Sears Roebuck, the US retailer, is preparing a Dollars 750m to Dollars 1bn
offering of asset-backed securities, while the European Investment Bank is
taking bids from banks for a Y50bn to Y100bn three-year offering.
A fall in the UK government bond market in early trading yesterday hampered
the launch by Cre'dit Local de France of a Pounds 100m four-year eurobond
issue.
Syndicate managers said that demand for the deal had also been hit by the
closure of the Belgium bond markets yesterday for National Day.
Aimed mainly at continental European retail investors, the bond was priced
to yield 27 basis points over the 6 per cent gilt due 1999. This spread
widened to about 33 basis points in later trading. Goldman Sachs, the lead
manager, admitted that placement of the issue had been affected by the
closure of the Belgian market.

Citibank yesterday became the first bank in Hong Kong to repackage part of
its residential property loan portfolio for sale to investors, when it
announced a HKDollars 1bn offering of mortgage-backed securities.
The bulk of the issue has already been placed with institutional investors
in Europe, Hong Kong, China and Japan, said Mr Timothy Kelly, head of Hong
Kong retail banking. The issue is expected to be completed by July 27.
The mortgages will be purchased from Citibank by Homes-1, which will finance
the purchase through the issue of HKDollars 1bn in securities. Homes-1 will
issue three tranches of securities.
Mr Kelly said the HKDollars 1bn of mortgages represented a small percentage
of the bank's portfolio, but it gave the bank another tool with which better
to manage its balance sheet, liquidity, and funding of assets.
Goldman Sachs (Asia) and Citicorp International are joint lead managers.

Amoco, the US energy group, said it would take a post-tax charge of Dollars
256m in the second quarter of its financial year to cover a reorganisation
in which 3,800 jobs will be cut. The announcement marks the end of a process
begun in March, when it first disclosed it was preparing a full-scale
restructuring of its operations.
The company said it expected to incur further restructuring charges of
Dollars 200m by the end of 1996, and shed an additional 2,000 jobs.
The move, which echoes cost-cutting at other US oil groups in recent months,
is intended to reduce annual expenses by Dollars 600m a year by the end of
1995.

FT  22 JUL 94 / International Company News: Fall in gold mine profits hits
Anglo American

<TEXT>
South Africa's Anglo American group, the world's biggest gold producer, has
reported attributable profit from its gold mines down sharply in the June
quarter, declining 31 per cent to R182.1m (Dollars 49.40m) from R263.5m the
previous quarter.
The poor results, which follow the trend set by other leading South African
gold producers, were largely the result of lower production levels as a
result of labour unrest and unscheduled public holidays because of the April
elections.
Although an improved spot price led to a higher average gold price received,
at R43,462 per kilogram compared to R41.621 per kilogram in the March
quarter, it was more than offset by an 8 per cent rise in average unit costs
to R33,923 per kilogram from R31,482 per kilogram. Total production dropped
to 57,683kg from 61,295kg.
Profits were further hit by the one-off transitional levy imposed by the
government on all South African companies to help finance the costs of the
election. This led to R21.4m in additional tax being paid for the quarter.
Without the levy, attributable profit would have only decreased 23 per cent.
Freegold, the group's biggest mine, had the worst results. Its attributable
profit fell 58.4 per cent to R47.7m compared with R114.6m in the March
quarter and gold produced fell to 23,982kg from 25,272kg. Freegold was also
hit by a lower average yield at 4.16 grammes per tonne from 4.33 grammes per
tonne.
Similarly, at Western Deep, attributable profit dropped 38.8 per cent to
R29m from R47.4m and at Vaal Reefs total production fell to 16,889kg from
17,928kg. However, Elandsrand's total production only dipped slightly to
4,193kg from 4,280kg, while Ergo, which reclaims gold from worked out mine
dumps, managed to raise attributable profit from R15.59m to R15.58m.

Bank of East Asia, Hong Kong's third largest listed bank, has reported
disappointing growth in first-half earnings, with profits for the six months
to June only 12 per cent ahead of the interim stage last year, at HKDollars
222.2m (USDollars 28.76m).
The result, struck after a secret transfer to inner reserves, were lower
than analysts had expected. The market was looking for growth in the region
of 18 per cent to 20 per cent. The directors declared an interim dividend of
27.5 cents, up 25 per cent on the interim payout last year.
The results were seen as the harbinger of a lacklustre reporting season for
the rest of Hong Kong's banks.
In keeping with Bank of East Asia's past practice, it provided no details of
its operations. A review by Mr David Li, chief executive, did say, however,
that a residential and commercial property development the bank is
undertaking had got off to a good start.
A report which has interested banking analysts was the one produced by
Merrill Lynch, the US securities house, for Bank of East Asia's recent
HKDollars 1bn bond offering. This gives the first breakdown for analysts of
the bank's financial position.
It shows that residential mortgages accounted for 44 per cent of the the

Kong Monetary Authority, the colony's central bank.

The results were seen as the harbinger of a lacklustre reporting season for

Analysts said that other listed banks in Hong Kong usually take their lead
from Bank of East Asia in deciding the tone of their own profits
announcements.
In keeping with Bank of East Asia's past practice, however, it provided no
details of its operations. A review by Mr David Li, chief executive, did
say, however, that a residential and commercial property development the
bank is undertaking had got off to a good start.
Analysts said they thought the sale of apartments from this development
could contribute up to HKDollars 400m to the bank's earnings in the second
half of the year.
They noted that the bank booked about 80 per cent of its total net earnings
for 1993 in the second half of the year and that a similar pattern may
repeat itself this year.
The report, however, which has most interested banking analysts was the one
produced by Merrill Lynch, the US securities house, for Bank of East Asia's
recent HKDollars 1bn bond offering. This gives the first breakdown for
analysts of the bank's financial position.
It shows that residential mortgages accounted for 44 per cent of the the
bank's total loans in 1993. This is above the level recommended by the Hong
Kong Monetary Authority, the colony's central bank. Mortgages have, however,
declined as a share of loans since 1991 when they accounted for 47 per cent
of lending.
The report also gives figures for the bank's bad and doubtful debts. Bank of
East Asia has HKDollars 542m of loan loss provisions on total loans of
HKDollars 32.3bn.

An Alberta court has approved Trizec's debt-restructuring plan despite
objections from the property developer's junior debenture holders.
The plan, which has been under negotiation for almost a year, is scheduled
for implementation from July 25. However, the dissenting creditors,
consisting mainly of US 'vulture funds' have indicated that they plan to
appeal the court ruling.
Under the plan, control of Trizec will pass from Toronto's Bronfman family

and Argo Partnership, a fund managed by New York's O'Connor Group.

<TEXT>
First-half figures for the majority of Saudi Arabia's commercial banks show
profits generally moving ahead, but signs of a marked slowdown in the
second-quarter indicate the kingdom's post-Gulf war banking boom has drawn
to a close.
Bankers and economists in the kingdom say the results show tighter liquidity
across the market, with deposits flat, assets up by little more than 5 per
cent, operating costs rising and provisions also higher.
With the Saudi government determined to cut public sector spending and the
recent rise in oil prices yet to filter through to an economy still feeling
the effect of the crude price slide of late last year, bankers and
economists say bank profits look set to remain under pressure. 'It's the
most testing time for the Saudi banking market since the mid-1980s,' said
one economist.
Among the latest results, Saudi American Bank, 30 per cent owned by
Citibank, reported an 11 per cent rise in first-half earnings over 1993,
with net profits up to SR522m (Dollars 140.87m). Al-Rahji Banking and
Investment, formerly the kingdom's biggest money changer, reported a 16 per
cent increase in net profit to SR434m.
Saudi Arabian Investment Bank, the kingdom's smallest, has reported a 21 per
cent rise in the half to SR39m.
However, Saudi French Bank, 31 per cent held by Banque Indosuez, said its
first-half earnings were up only 1.3 per cent over 1993 to SR175m, while
Saudi British Bank, which is 40 per cent held by Hong Kong and Shanghai
Corporation, also reported a slight rise in earnings of just over 1 per cent
to SR195.3 over a year earlier, according to unaudited figures.
Saudi Hollandi Bank, 40 per cent owned by ABN Amro, the Dutch bank, said
first-half earnings had increased 1.6 per cent to SR93.6m.
Only two banks have had outright profit falls for the first half, with Riyad
Bank reporting a 12 per cent decline to SR374m over last year. Arab National
Bank posted an 8 per cent decline to SR216m for the period.
However, more than half of the banks to have issued results so far show
marked declines in earnings for the second quarter compared with the first.
Bankers and economists in the kingdom attribute this partly to exchange rate
losses taken as a result of the dollar's recent weakness and to falls in
world bond and equity prices.
Analysts also cite the contraction in public sector activity as a factor,
with the Saudi government committed to cutting all government departments's
spending by 20 per cent for the 1994 fiscal year.
Cuts are being made largely by cancelled or postponed projects and often
through delayed payments by government agencies to private sector
contractors, according to bankers in the kingdom, who say the government
appears to be 'doing its best' to meet its spending target.
According to Mr Henry Azzam, chief economist at National Commercial Bank,
lending to the private sector remains firm, with all the banks to have
reported so far showing bigger loan portfolios - with the Saudi American
Bank's having increased by 25 per cent.
'In the domestic economy the demand for bank loans remains firm and margins
are firming,' he says, adding that continued growth in the private sector
looked set to improve bank figures slightly in the next two quarters.
Some of this lending, though, reflects cover to companies stretched by
delays in government payments.
'Banks will be looking more closely at the quality of their lending over the
next few months,' says one banker, who said there would also be increased
pressure on banks to increase provisions over the next six months.

FT  22 JUL 94 / International Company News: A tale of two strategies in the
biotechnology sector - Celltech's deal is a dream come true but Synergen
lost a high-risk gamble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the space of four days, the biotechnology sector has demonstrated why it
is a high-risk, and occasionally high-reward, industry.
On Monday, Colorado-based Synergen announced it was abandoning research on
its main product, laying off half its 630 staff and putting the company up
for sale.
Yesterday, the UK's Celltech achieved what is a biotechnologist's dream: a
collaborative deal with the biggest US drug company, Merck, that could net
it more than Dollars 100m a year from the start of the next decade.
The difference between the two companies runs deeper than the quality of
their respective drugs. Each followed a profoundly different corporate
strategy: Synergen decided to go it alone and Celltech to collaborate with
pharmaceutical companies.
The choice between the two is exercising to the management of many
biotechnology companies. The decisions that they take will determine the
shape of the sector and its relationship with the entire healthcare
business.
The Celltech deal has the financial complexity that is typical of the
biotech sector. The company benefits in three tangible ways:
It is to receive cash payments of up to Pounds 31.5m (Dollars 48m) over five
years related to the progress in developing an asthma treatment code-named
CDP 840;
Merck will pay for clinical testing of the drug. Phase I trials on healthy
volunteers have been completed. CDP 840 must now enter the far more
expensive phases II and III where it is given to thousands of patients;
Celltech will receive 'double-digit royalties' on sales into a market worth
more than Dollars 4bn a year. It has the option of contributing to phase III
trials and triggering a profit sharing scheme that would take the effective
royalty rate to more than 20 per cent.
These potential sums are huge to a company such as Celltech, which has a
market capitalisation of Pounds 135m.
Just as importantly, the deal represents a vote of confidence from Merck
which, as far as investors are concerned, ought to have a better idea of how
to evaluate a prospective drug than any stock market analyst. Celltech's
shares jumped more than 10 per cent when the deal was announced.
Synergen, by contrast saw its share price almost halve on Monday when it
said it would abandon its sepsis treatment Antril.
The pain was all the worse for the years of effort and more than Dollars
100m that the company had sunk into the drug: the failure came at the end of
the phase III trials.
Synergen had built its own manufacturing plant and engaged sales and
marketing teams. It was spending money at a rate - known in the biotech
sector as the burn rate - of Dollars 80m a year.
Celltech's burn rate is about Pounds 8m a year, and this outflow should be
cut by more than half by the staged payments from Merck.
The difference is deliberate. 'Synergen bet the company,' says one senior
Celltech executive. 'We don't want to do that.'
That philosophy may sound eminently sensible, but until recently it
represented a minority view in the industry. Most took the view that
biotechnology was inherently a high-risk business and that, therefore, there
must be huge rewards in prospect to attract investors.
They pointed to California's Amgen, the biotech sector's one unequivocal
success story. Amgen went it alone. It now has two drugs in the world top 25
and is forecast by stockbroker Lehman Brothers to have two of the top five
by the end of the decade.
However, the list of failed aspirant Amgens is getting longer.
The biggest apart from Synergen was Pennsylvania's Centocor, which two years
ago dropped development of its septic shock drug, but not until it had
invested in manufacturing plants and sales and marketing teams.
Centocor's fate shattered many illusions about the biotech sector and
engendered a scepticism that still restrains investors.
Increasingly, biotech companies are seeking an alternative to the Amgen,
Synergen, Centocor approach. Many, including Celltech, have picked on
Chiron, the number three US biotechnology company. Chiron has built its
success on a series of alliances with big name drug companies. They include
Germany's Schering, Switzerland's Ciba, Sweden's Pharmacia and Johnson and
Johnson of the US.
A biotech company entering into such collaborations abandons the dream of
becoming a giant pharmaceutical group. But it is a move that, as this week's
events show, has its attractions.

Biochem Pharma, one of Canada's largest biotechnology companies, is taking a
drug it is developing with Glaxo, Europe's biggest pharmaceutical company,
into the last stage of clinical trials, writes Daniel Green.
Trials so far have shown Lamivudine to be far superior to existing
treatments for hepatitis B, said Dr Francesco Bellini, president of the
Montreal company which is hoping to launch the drug in 1997.
The deal with Glaxo gives the UK company marketing rights outside north
America, with a joint venture operating in Canada and Biochem selling alone
in the US.

FT  22 JUL 94 / International Company News: Strong sales growth lifts
Caterpillar to Dollars 240m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Caterpillar yesterday reported record second-quarter profits of Dollars
240m, or Dollars 2.36 a share, as the US heavy equipment manufacturer
benefited from economic recoveries at home and abroad, which have sharply
lifted sales of the group's products.
In the same quarter a year ago, the group earned Dollars 67m, or 66 cents a
share.
However, the strong quarterly results are overshadowed by a long-running
dispute with unions over labour practices which resulted last month in
14,000 members of the United Autoworkers Union walking out on strike.
The industrial action, which started as a series of short strikes but
escalated in the final week of June into a full-scale strike, had no impact
upon second-quarter earnings, said Caterpillar.
The group also predicted that a continuation of the strike would not harm
its earnings greatly later in the year.
Sales of the group's products in the US, which account for just over half of
Caterpillar's total sales, jumped 25 per cent between April and June to
Dollars 1.8bn, a result of both increased demand and higher prices.
Overseas sales rose 23 per cent to Dollars 1.68bn, thanks to gains in Asia,
Latin America and among former members of the Soviet Union. However, sales
to the Middle East fell during the quarter.
Caterpillar's financial products division reported a Dollars 2m decline in
pre-tax profits to Dollars 14m.
This was the result of a Dollars 4m charge the group was forced to take to
cover the introduction of mark-to-market accounting of interest rate
derivatives products purchased by Caterpillar Financial Services.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After-tax profits at Monsanto, the US chemicals group, climbed 29 per cent
in the second quarter of the year. Its chemicals group benefited from the
economic upswing in the US and Searle, its drugs company, shook off losses
from the year before.
Net income of Dollars 258m, or Dollars 2.19 a share, was ahead of market
expectations and compared with Dollars 200m, or Dollars 1.66 a year ago.
In the chemicals area, Monsanto's operating profits rose to Dollars 103m
from Dollars 75m on sales down to Dollars 926m from Dollars 933m, thanks
mainly to demand in the US automotive, housing and home furnishing markets.
Searle, which reported a Dollars 37m operating loss a year ago, returned a
Dollars 3m profit in the latest quarter on a 9 per cent improvement in
sales, to Dollars 415m. The sales growth came from Ambien, an insomnia drug,
and Daypro and Arthrotec, two treatments for arthritis.
For the six months as a whole, net income rose to Dollars 452m on sales of
Dollars 4.3bn, from Dollars 341m on sales of Dollars 4.2bn a year before.
Warner Lambert saw its drugs sales fall by 3 per cent in the second quarter,
although sales overall grew by 7 per cent to Dollars 1.55bn on strong gains
from consumer products, particularly in the US.
The lower pharmaceutical sales were due to a 9 per cent fall in the US as
Lopid, a lipid drug, faced competition from generic alternatives on the
expiry of its patent.
Net income of Dollars 197m, up from Dollars 190m a year before, and earnings
per share of Dollars 1.47, up from Dollars 1.40, were broadly in line with
market expectations. For the half year, Warner Lambert recorded net income
of Dollars 387m on sales of Dollars 3bn, compared with Dollars 372m on sales
of Dollars 2.8bn.

FT  22 JUL 94 / International Company News: Charge holds back Colgate
Palmolive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Colgate-Palmolive, the US consumer products group, posted net income
virtually unchanged at Dollars 142.5m in the second quarter. The group was
hampered by a fall in profits in North America and a Dollars 5.2m charge for
the sale of a non-core business.
World-wide unit volume grew by 9 per cent, driven by strong increases in
Europe and the developing world. Group sales rose 7 per cent to Dollars
1.9bn, and would have risen by 9 per cent without the adverse effect of
shifts in exchange rates.
However, volume slumped by nearly 9 per cent in North America in spite of
the introduction of new products. Colgate-Palmolive said its goods were
still being bought in the same quantities but the retail trade had sharply
reduced stocks.
Net income in the comparable quarter was Dollars 142.4m.
Colgate-Palmolive said the latest figure would have been 4 per cent ahead
without the special charge.
Fully diluted earnings per share, lifted by aggressive stock repurchases
that reduced issued equity by 8 per cent, rose by 7 per cent to 87 cents
from 81 cents.
Net income in the first half rose to Dollars 292.1m from Dollars 283.2m,
excluding the effect of accounting changes last time.

FT  22 JUL 94 / International Company News: Coca-Cola reshuffles top
managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Coca-Cola, the US soft drink group, yesterday announced a management
reshuffle that will be seen as anointing a probable successor to Mr Roberto
Goizueta, the chairman and chief executive.
He is Mr Douglas Ivester, 47, currently head of Coca-Cola's North American
operations. He has been appointed to the number two position at Coca-Cola as
president and chief operating officer - a role that has lain vacant since Mr
Donald Keough, the previous incumbent, left on reaching retirement age in
April last year.
Mr Goizueta has been chief executive of Coca-Cola for 13 years, and under
normal company policy would have stepped down on reaching his 65th birthday
in November 1996.
Last April, Coca-Cola's board announced that it had asked Mr Goizueta to
stay on beyond that date for an indefinite period, but this failed to dampen
speculation about who would eventually succeed him.
The two men most often cited as candidates had been Mr Ivester and Mr John
Hunter, 56, head of Coca-Cola's international operations. But under
yesterday's reorganisation Mr Hunter will be left reporting to Mr Ivester.
Coca-Cola yesterday played down the idea that the reshuffle settled the
succession. Mr Goizueta told the Financial Times: 'Those who are of that
view are uninformed individuals in the sense that the chief executive
officer and chief operating officer have two distinct jobs. This is not a
game of musical chairs in which you go from one to the other.'
Mr Goizueta said he had no idea when he would retire, and it was impossible
to look into the future and determine what the company would require of a
chief executive when that day arrived. 'So it would be presumptuous on my
part or anyone else's part to consider this the anointment of a successor.'
Even so, industry analysts such as Mr Andrew Conway at Salomon Brothers, the
Wall Street securities house, said Mr Ivester's experience made him well
qualified for the job. Mr Ivester has previously served as group chief
financial officer and head of Coca-Cola's European business as well as
running Coca-Cola North America.
Coca-Cola said Mr Jack Stahl, chief financial officer, would become head of
Coca-Cola USA, and Mr James Chestnut, vice-president and controller, would
succeed Mr Stahl.

FT  22 JUL 94 / International Company News: Comcast enlists Liberty Media in
battle for QVC
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Comcast, the US cable and telecommunications group, yesterday bolstered its
offer for QVC when it announced that Liberty Media, a QVC shareholder, had
agreed to become Comcast's partner in an all-cash bid of Dollars 44-a-share
for the television home shopping network.
Previously, Comcast had offered to pay Dollars 44-a-share in mix of cash and
stock for the 85 per cent of QVC it did not own, a bid that valued the home
shopping network at Dollars 2.2bn. That bid forced QVC to abandon its
earlier plan to merge with CBS, the broadcast television group which had
offered to pay Dollars 38-a-share for the company.
QVC yesterday said it was reviewing the revised offer from Comcast and
Liberty Media, which owns 20 per cent of QVC. It said it would continue to
'explore alternatives to maximise shareholder value'. News of the
Comcast-Liberty Media offer depressed QVC's share price yesterday as it
removed the possibility that Tele-Communications (TCI), the cable group and
parent of Liberty Media, might launch a counter bid for QVC.
Mr John Malone, TCI chairman, had expressed dissatisfaction with Comcast's
offer for QVC, and investors had hoped that TCI, or another big
entertainment or telecommunications company, might launch a bid for QVC.
Shares in QVC fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 44 on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday. Liberty Media rose Dollars  13/16 to Dollars 21 1/16 and Comcast
rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 16 3/4 .
If the Comcast-Liberty Media offer succeeds, Comcast will end up owning 57
per cent and Liberty Media 43 per cent of QVC. The two companies have agreed
that Comcast will manage QVC once the merger is completed, but there was no
indication whether Mr Barry Diller, chairman of QVC who masterminded the
plan to merge with CBS, would stay on.

Northwest Airlines, the fourth biggest US carrier, yesterday reported a
turnround from net losses of Dollars 136.2m last time to net profits of
Dollars 71.3m for its first full quarter since returning to the stock market
in March.
The company attributed the improvement to an 8.5 per cent increase in
revenues to Dollars 2.27bn, combined with a slight decrease in operating
expenses, down to Dollars 2.07bn from Dollars 2.08bn.
Second-quarter operating profits rose to Dollars 207.8m from Dollars 19.2m.
Fully diluted earnings per share were 67 cents, compared with losses of
Dollars 2.42.
For the six months to June, the company reported a turnround to profits of
Dollars 89.6m from losses of Dollars 236.5m.
The company said this was the first time it had reported four consecutive
quarters of net profits since 1989.
Southwest Airlines, the low-cost US carrier that has expanded rapidly by
undercutting other airlines' fares, yesterday reported a 38 per cent
increase in net income to Dollars 58.5m from Dollars 42.1m for the second
quarter on revenues up 16 per cent at Dollars 661.1m. The prior year's
figures have been adjusted to include results from Morris Air, acquired at
the end of last year.

US Steel, the country's biggest steel maker, yesterday said it expected the
steel market to remain strong in the third quarter, as it reported a further
advance in underlying profits for the second quarter of the year.
Mr Charles Corry, chairman of USX, the company's parent, said order books
remained full and would benefit from further price improvement.
In the three months to June, US Steel earned after-tax profits of Dollars
56m on sales of Dollars 1.5bn, compared with a loss of Dollars 336m (after
one-off charges of Dollars 349m) on sales of Dollars 1.4bn the year before.
Earnings per share were were 65 cents, compared with a loss of Dollars 5.71
cents a share a year ago.
The improvement at US Steel contributed to a rebound in earnings at USX,
which also owns Marathon and Delhi. Net income for the group was Dollars 98m
on sales of Dollars 4.8bn, compared with a loss of Dollars 322m on sales of
Dollars 4.6bn the year before.

<TEXT>
AT&amp;T, the largest US telecommunications group, yesterday reported solid
second-quarter profits of Dollars 1.13bn, or 83 cents a share, an increase
of 11.2 per cent.
In the same quarter a year ago the group earned Dollars 1.01bn, or 74 cents
restated to account for accounting changes.
The second-quarter profits took first-half 1994 earnings to Dollars 2.22bn.
A year ago, AT&amp;T reported a first-half loss of Dollars 5.8bn, but excluding
the impact of accounting changes, earnings in the period totalled Dollars
1.94bn.
The improvement in second-quarter results was attributed by AT&amp;T to strong
revenue growth from its long-distance telecommunications, equipment
manufacturing and financial services businesses.
Total revenues in the quarter were Dollars 17.7bn, up 8.7 per cent from a
year earlier.
On Wall Street, the shares closed Dollars  1/2 higher at Dollars 53 5/8 .
McCaw Cellular Communications, the US mobile phone company about to be taken
over by AT&amp;T in an all-share deal worth Dollars 12.6bn, made its first-ever
profit in its last quarter as an independent company, it reported yesterday,
writes Richard Tomkins.
In the three months to June it made net profits of Dollars 137m, or 65 cents
a share, compared to losses of Dollars 22.1m, or 11 cents last time.
Revenues rose 26 per cent to Dollars 682.7m.

<TEXT>
Abitibi-Price, the world's biggest newsprint producer, suffered another loss
in the second quarter, but scraped together its first operating profit in
almost a year.
The Toronto-based company reported a net loss of CDollars 17.7m (USDollars
12.6m), or 19 cents a share, down from CDollars 19.8m, or 29 cents, a year
earlier.
The latest figures include a CDollars 5.2m charge stemming from the expected
closure of a newsprint machine at Grand Falls, Newfoundland.
Interest expenses rose sharply. Operating profit from continuing operations
was CDollars 2.9m, against a CDollars 10.8m loss.
Sales rose by 12 per cent to CDollars 518.6m, mainly due to higher volumes.
Mr Ron Oberlander, chief executive, predicted higher prices and further
cost-cutting should produce better results in the second half.
Abitibi painted an encouraging picture of the newsprint market.
A 7 per cent cut in discounts was implemented earlier this year in North
America and another 6 per cent reduction has been announced for mid-August.
Newsprint consumption at US daily newspapers was 4.5 per cent higher in May
than a year earlier, while customer inventories have fallen by about a
quarter.
Offshore consumption has also grown, with Abitibi's shipments rising by
93,300 tonnes during the second quarter compared to a year earlier.
Newsprint and groundwood paper output climbed to 1.2m tonnes in the first
half, from 1.1m tonnes a year earlier. Second-quarter production was up 16
per cent.

Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, announced strong
growth in sales and earnings for its fourth quarter. The results were
boosted by a surge in sales of personal computer operating systems programs.
On Saturday, Microsoft settled anti-trust complaints by reaching an
agreement with the US Justice Department and European competition
authorities to modify the terms on which it sells operating system licences
to PC makers.
It said the settlement would have no material impact on earnings.
Second-quarter revenues were Dollars 1.29bn, up 24 per cent over the Dollars
1.04bn for the same period in 1993. Net income was Dollars 362m, or 59 cents
a share (restated to reflect the company's two-for-one stock split in May),
compared with Dollars 265m, or 43 cents.
Income includes a Dollars 30m reversal of part of a third-quarter Dollars
120m charge, relating to a Los Angeles court order that Microsoft pay
damages to Stac Electronics for patent infringement. Last month, Microsoft
reached a settlement agreement with Stac. Net income for the fourth quarter
would have been Dollars 342m, or 56 cents, without the gain.
For the year, revenues were Dollars 4.65bn, up 24 per cent from Dollars
3.75bn in fiscal 1993. Net income rose 20 per cent to Dollars 1.15bn from
Dollars 953m. Earnings per share were Dollars 1.88, compared with Dollars
1.57 last year after the stock split.
Excluding the litigation charge and the settlement, net income for the year
was Dollars 1.21bn, or Dollars 1.98.
'We've completed our 19th consecutive year of revenue and earnings growth,'
said Mr Mike Brown, vice-president of finance.
Microsoft's sales of operating systems programs to PC manufacturers reached
an all-time high, up 61 per cent over the preceding 12 months. Sales of
Windows, the widely used PC operating system, were particularly strong.

FT  22 JUL 94 / International Company News: Slumbering Lac Minerals receives
a wake-up call - The gold producer is fighting a bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lac Minerals has for many years been near the top of mining analysts' list
of companies in need of a wake-up call.
Its board of directors is heavily tilted towards retirees and professional
men. Its executive chairman, Mr Peter Allen, has an imperious style which
has won few friends in the investment community.
That loud call came on July 7 when Lac, the Toronto-based gold and
base-metals producer which has been widely criticised for tardiness, became
the target of a bid.
An audacious USDollars 1.4bn takeover offer was launched by Royal Oak Mines,
the Vancouver-based gold producer whose pugnacity makes it the antithesis to
Lac.
By the time Lac delivered its response early this week, the directors had
tripled their estimate of its gold reserves and given the go-ahead to invest
Dollars 600m over the next three years in new projects.
Mr Jim Pitblado, a non-executive director and retired head of Canada's
biggest securities dealer, said the board had 'complete confidence' in Lac's
management.
However, he acknowledged that 'there's a feeling that we should be telling
our story a little more firmly and a little more aggressively in the market
place'.
Royal Oak, with projected 1994 gold output of 375,000 ounces, is only about
one-third Lac's size.
Its four low-grade mines in Canada are minnows compared with the Lac empire,
which stretches across the US, Canada and Chile. As the bid for Lac shows,
Royal Oak seldom backs away from a scrap.
Ms Peggy Witte, its tenacious president, is a US-born mining engineer with a
reputation for putting crippled mines back on their feet by cutting costs to
the bone.
She kept the Giant Yellowknife mine in the Northwest Territories running for
a year during one of the most bitter and violent strikes in Canadian mining
history.
Although Ms Witte can take credit for rousing Lac from its slumber, Royal
Oak remains a long-shot to win the takeover battle.
'You've got to be out of your tree to accept the Royal Oak offer,' says Mr
Peter Miller, analyst at Yorkton Securities in London. Almost three-quarters
of the bid comprises Royal Oak shares, which Mr Pitblado dismissed as 'paper
of questionable value'.
Much of the Dollars 40m-Dollars 50m a year in cost savings which Ms Witte
claims she can squeeze out of Lac would be offset by interest charges on the
Dollars 700m in long-term debt which Royal Oak would take on to finance its
bid and augment working capital.
The combined company's earnings could be wiped out for years by the
amortisation of almost Dollars 1bn in goodwill, which under Canadian
accounting rules would not qualify as a tax deduction.
The chances of the combined company paying a dividend in the near future
without a large increase in the gold price, are nil.
The increased reserves and new projects announced by Lac this week -
assuming they come to fruition - raise further questions about the value of
Royal Oak's offer.
Estimates of proven and possible reserves have been lifted from 8.6m to
13.5m ounces, plus 'additional geological resources' of 13.5m ounces. The
increases come largely from exploration projects at two properties in
northern Chile, Red Mountain in British Columbia, and from mines in Ontario
and the US.
In the past 10 days, Lac's board has approved construction of a Dollars 110m
mine at Red Mountain with an expected annual output of 225,000 ounces a year
from the end of 1996.
It has given the go-ahead for the Dollars 168m La Nevada mine in Chile,
whose target production is 200,000 ounces a year. A new vein, with estimated
reserves of 1m ounces, has been discovered at the El Indio mine in Chile.
Lac has stepped up exploration outside North America over the past year or
so, concentrating on Australasia, Sweden and Niger.
The Royal Oak bid, which expires on August 9, is unlikely to be the last
word in the Lac story. Royal Oak said this week it was highly sceptical of
the sudden increase in Lac's gold reserves. 'Royal Oak has always
acknowledged Lac's world-class assets, but it has questioned Lac's
management of those assets,' Ms Witte said.
Lac's shares are widely held, mainly by North American institutions.
Several shareholders have stepped up the pressure by tentatively depositing
their shares with Royal Oak. But most observers expect a better offer to
materialise. A Canadian analyst came away from a Lac briefing in Toronto
last Monday with the firm impression that the company was for sale.
Mr Pitblado confirmed that Lac's financial advisers were exploring other
strategic options. He declined to be more specific, nor to say whether Lac
was likely to survive in its present form.
Several other gold producers may be interested in Lac, and be more
acceptable to its management and shareholders than Royal Oak.
At the top of Mr Miller's list is Cambior, the Montreal-based gold producer
whose properties in Quebec and Latin America would make a good fit with Lac.
Other possible candidates within North America include American Barrick,
Battle Mountain, Amax Gold and Pegassus Gold. South African mining houses
eager to expand abroad may take a serious look.
The betting in the investment community is that if Lac doesn't survive in
its present form, nor will some of its directors and managers.

FT  22 JUL 94 / International Company News: General Dynamics up 3.7%

<TEXT>
General Dynamics, the US defence contractor, yesterday reported
second-quarter earnings of Dollars 56m, or 88 cents a share, up 3.7 per
cent, saying that its pared-down operations had showed steady improvement in
the second quarter.
The results underscored the success of the cutbacks which were largely
completed this spring with the sale of its Space Launch Systems arm.
The figures for the continuing businesses, which were slightly better than
analysts had predicted, compare with net income of Dollars 54m, or 85 cents,
in the corresponding 1993 quarter.
Revenues were up nearly 10 per cent at Dollars 820m.
The 1994 results exclude a one-time net gain of Dollars 15m from the
disposal of the space division, acquired by Martin Marietta for Dollars
208m. The year-earlier figures take no account of a Dollars 9m non-recurring
gain and reflect a two-for-one stock split in April.
Mr James Mellor, who took over as chairman and chief executive two months
ago, attributed the solid performance in part to efforts to cut costs and
boost productivity. The group's cash balance was Dollars 988m at the end of
June, up from Dollars 711m three months ago.
General Dynamics once produced a wide array of weapons systems but is
engaged now in the manufacture of only submarines and tanks.
The electric boat division was recently awarded Dollars 130m in start-up
funding to build a third Seawolf-class attack submarine for the US Navy. At
the armoured vehicles division, the company said yesterday, there was
progress in settling a month-long strike by 2,000 workers.
For the first six months of the year, General Dynamics posted net earnings
of Dollars 126m, compared with Dollars 748m in the 1993 period, when it
booked a Dollars 645m net gain on the sale of its Tactical Military Aircraft
business. Revenues were flat at Dollars 1.6bn.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Northwest Airlines, the fourth biggest US carrier, yesterday reported a
turnround from net losses of Dollars 136.2m last time to net profits of
Dollars 71.3m for its first full quarter since returning to the stock market
in March.
The company attributed the improvement to an 8.5 per cent increase in
revenues to Dollars 2.27bn, combined with a slight decrease in operating
expenses, down to Dollars 2.07bn from Dollars 2.08bn.
Second-quarter operating profits rose to Dollars 207.8m from Dollars 19.2m.
Fully diluted earnings per share were 67 cents, compared with losses of
Dollars 2.42 last time.
For the six months to June, the company reported a turnround to profits of
Dollars 89.6m from losses of Dollars 236.5m.
The quarter was the fourth consecutive period of profitability for Northwest
at a time when most other big US airlines have been showing losses or very
small profits. The company said this was the first time it had reported four
consecutive quarters of net profits since 1989.
It wes helped by an agreement with its labour unions under which employees
agreed to exchange Dollars 886m worth of labour concessions for a 33 per
cent stake in the company (down to 26 per cent following the initial public
offering).
Northwest has been restructuring its routes and flights in an attempt to cut
out loss-making services and increase profitable flying. The number of
available seat miles fell by 1.8 per cent to 21.39bn.

AT&amp;T, the largest US telecommunications group, yesterday reported solid
second-quarter profits of Dollars 1.13bn, or 83 cents a share. In the same
quarter a year ago the group earned Dollars 1.01bn, or 74 cents restated to
account for accounting changes.
The second-quarter profits took first-half 1994 earnings to Dollars 2.22bn.
A year ago, AT&amp;T reported a first-half loss of Dollars 5.8bn, but excluding
the impact of accounting changes, earnings in the period totalled Dollars
1.94bn.
The improvement in second-quarter results was attributed by AT&amp;T to strong
revenue growth from its long-distance telecommunications, equipment
manufacturing and financial services businesses. Total revenues in the
quarter were Dollars 17.7bn, up 8.7 per cent from a year earlier.
The results were well received by investors on Wall Street, who bid up the
company's stock Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 53 5/8 on the New York Stock
Exchange in early trading.
AT&amp;T's core long-distance business posted a 5 per cent increase in revenues
to Dollars 10.34bn.
The accelerating pace of economic activity, plus strong sales of new
consumer services, lifted calling volume 7 per cent during the period.
Revenues from the group's products and systems division climbed 19 per cent
to Dollars 4.9bn, with network telecommunications products and systems sales
in the US and overseas growing sharply, and the computer business (formerly
NCR) posting a profit on strong equipment sales.
Although rentals and other services revenues declined slightly to Dollars
1.69bn, earnings from the financial services business, which runs equipment
financing, leasing and credit card services, jumped 23 per cent to Dollars
723m.

FT  22 JUL 94 / International Company News: Telefonica hums with talk of
alliance - GTE may take a minority stake in the Spanish group's
international unit,
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Telefonica, Spain's national telecoms operator, is set to engage in talks
next week with GTE, which could lead to the US operator taking a minority
stake in Telefonica's international arm. The outcome will have a significant
bearing on the global battle between the largest international telecoms
companies.
In addition to GTE, Telefonica will be talking to Unisource, the European
joint venture grouping the Dutch, Swedish and Swiss national operators that
it formally joined earlier this month, and also to AT&amp;T, the US
long-distance group that in June forged an international venture with
Unisource. AT&amp;T and Unisource could both be invited to take small stakes in
Telefonica Internacional SA (Tisa), the international subsidiary. .
For AT&amp;T and Unisource, the prize is way into Latin America. In the last
five years Telefonica has built Tisa into the dominant operator in the
fast-growing Latin American market. A strategic partnership between Tisa and
GTE could lend critical support to the AT&amp;T-Unisource alliance as it takes
on international rivals - notably the Dollars 5.3bn alliance between British
Telecommunications and MCI of the US - in the battle to become 'one-stop'
telecoms providers to multinationals.
With a market capitalisation of between Dollars 6bn-Dollars 7bn and an 89
per cent rise in its first quarter profits this year to Dollars 30.8m, Tisa
is the jewel in Telefonica's crown.
Its Latin American ventures started with the bargain basement purchase of a
20 per cent stake in Entel Chile in 1989 for Dollars 48m. The biggest recent
acquisition was the record Dollars 2bn paid to acquire 35 per cent of Peru's
CPT-Entel last March. Tisa has exploited its roots in a common Hispanic
culture to snap up opportunities in Latin America.
Tisa has stakes in 20 different companies, including local and long distance
operators, data transmission and mobile telephone units and yellow pages
franchise holders. As one Telefonica official put it: 'Before we were the
wall-flower at the party but now, dressed as Tisa, everyone wants to dance
with us.'
Tisa's strategy has been masterminded by a close-knit troika of Telefonica's
chairman, Mr Candido Velazquez-Gaztelu, Mr German Ancochea, the group's
chief executive, and Mr Inaki Santillana, Tisa managing director. The three
are frequent travellers to Latin America, which they view as the natural
stamping ground for the Spanish group and the launch pad for its elevation
to the high table of global telecommunications operators.
Telefonica owns 76.2 per cent of Tisa, with the Patrimonio del Estado, the
Spanish government's portfolio, holding the remaining 23.8 per cent.
Telefonica is attracted to GTE as a partner for its management expertise as
an operator in all the main US markets - national, local, data and cellular.
The two companies have co-operated extensively in CANTV, the Venezuelan
operator. A GTE-led consortium, in which Tisa is as a minority shareholder,
took a 40 per cent stake at the privatisation of CANTV in 1991.
Telefonica believes that its links with AT&amp;T, through Unisource, are not
incompatible with a GTE partnership. A Telefonica official said the two
alliances were 'complementary' because GTE is primarily a local operator,
like Telefonica, serving mostly small customers in specific territories,
whereas AT&amp;T is a long-distance traffic carrier with particularly strong
links to the large corporate sector. The logic behind an agreement with AT&amp;T
is that the US giant will help handle Tisa's global traffic.
A GTE alliance would complement Telefonica's membership of Unisource for the
same reasons. By joining the Dutch, Swedish and Swiss venture, Telefonica
believes it gains access to European-based multinationals. The official
said: 'We simply don't have in Spain any Unilevers, Astras and any Nestles;
we have many more lines than the other Unisource partners but we haven't got
their sort of clients.' By hooking up Tisa to Unisource, Telefonica expects
to manage a profitable link between European business and Latin America.
According to Mr Juan Cueto, chief analyst at the Madrid broking house
Ibersecurities, which this week issued a report on Tisa, the package put
together by Telefonica's strategists will outstrip in terms of business
volume the alliance between BT and MCI, the second largest US long-distance
operator. It would also be a serious rival to the other putative
international alliance, that between the French and German state operators
and Sprint, the third-largest US long-distance operator.
Telefonica's current thinking is to sell an initial stake of around 10 per
cent of Tisa to GTE by issuing new equity in the subsidiary. This would
raise some Dollars 600m-Dollars 700m, available to increase its investment
in Latin America in partnership with GTE. Privatisations in Bolivia,
Colombia, Ecuador and Nicaragua are on the horizon, and Telefonica is
exploring prospects in Cuba and in Brazil.
The company's balance sheet will be bolstered by the forthcoming disposal of
its 20 per cent stake in Chile's Entel, now worth some Dollars 200m,
following a ruling by the local anti-trust commission which has forced Tisa
to choose between its holdings in Entel and in CTC, the other Chilean
operator, in which it holds a 43 per cent stake bought from the Bond
Corporation for Dollars 468m in 1990.
The nature of the involvement in Tisa by AT&amp;T and Unisource remains unclear.
They might become strategic shareholders through an equity issue similar to
that envisaged for GTE. Alternatively, the Spanish government's Patrimonio
del Estado might dispose of all or part of its Tisa shares in their favour.
The Spanish state still holds a 32.2 per cent stake in Telefonica, which
could be reduced in due course.
Telefonica is anxious for the alliances to be as 'hard' as possible, which
on international form implies an equity exchange to underlie any operating
and marketing agreement. However, one of the few certainties is the
determination of Telefonica to retain a 51 per cent stake in its subsidiary.
Tisa is its golden egg; it is not prepared to see it pass into other hands.

FT  22 JUL 94 / International Company News: Heavy securities side losses hit
Salomon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Salomon yesterday reported a second-quarter loss of Dollars 204m, or Dollars
2.08 a share, following heavy losses at its Salomon Brothers securities
broking unit. In the year-ago quarter, Salomon earned a profit of Dollars
433m, or Dollars 3.32 a share.
For the first six months, the group ran up a net loss of Dollars 138m, or
Dollars 1.54 a share, compared with a net profit of Dollars 331m, Dollars
2.52, in the first half of 1993.
Although the group warned Wall Street about its poor second quarter results
two weeks ago, the scale of the losses at Salomon Brothers - Dollars 410m
before taxes - surprised analysts, who had been expecting a figure nearer
Dollars 300m. In the second quarter of 1993, the firm earned a pre-tax
profit of Dollars 783m.
The near Dollars 1.2bn difference between the results of this latest quarter
and the same quarter a year ago illustrates the extreme volatility of profit
flows on Wall Street. The big firms such as Salomon Brothers, which trade
actively for themselves and with large institutional customers, are
particularly vulnerable to large swings in their earnings.
The poor results are also the starkest indication yet of how the slump in
international financial markets this year, prompted by rising US interest
rates, has taken a toll in the securities industry.
Earlier this week, Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers, two other big Wall
Street houses, announced sharply lower profits for the second quarter, and
other big firms are expected to follow suit when they report their results
later this month.
Salomon said that the bulk of the losses at its brokerage unit - Dollars
291m of the Dollars 410m total - were attributable to client-driven
business, where the value of its securities inventories plunged and trading
and underwriting activity dropped sharply.
The inventory losses are believed to have been particularly heavy in the
mortgage-backed securities area, where a precipitous drop in prices this
year has led to liquidity problems and big losses at several Wall Street
firms.
Salomon Brothers has also struggled with its proprietary trading business,
where losses totalled Dollars 119m.
The one bright note in Salomon's results was the performance of its Phibro
oil trading unit, which took advantage of volatility in oil prices to record
a pre-tax profit of Dollars 82m, up sharply from the Dollars 3m profit of a
year ago. The Phibro USA oil refining business, however, made a loss of
Dollars 10m, up from Dollars 2m in 1993.
Dean Witter Discover, the securities broking and credit card group, reported
second quarter net income of Dollars 206.9m, up 32 per cent from a year ago
due primarily to a big increase in earnings at its credit services division,
which includes the highly successful Discover card business.
The group's securities unit bucked the industry-wide trend of declining
earnings, posting profits growth of 11 per cent in the quarter as rising
asset management fees offset lower commission and investment banking
revenues.

FT  22 JUL 94 / International Company News: Kmart to sell 21.5% holding in
Coles Myer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kmart, the troubled US discount store group, yesterday performed an abrupt
about-turn by announcing that it was selling its 21.5 per cent in Coles
Myer, the Australian retailer, for ADollars 1.26bn (USDollars 924m).
Last month, Kmart attempted to dampen speculation that it may sell the stake
by saying that this was 'incorrect and unfounded'.
The speculation was given fresh impetus when angry Kmart shareholders,
frustrated at the company's poor financial performance, threw out its plans
to raise money by selling off minority stakes in its four specialty
retailing subsidiaries in the US.
Kmart needed the plan to go ahead because the proceeds were supposed to help
pay for the modernisation of its core US discount store operations. So when
the plan was voted down, attention switched back to the Coles Myers stake as
a potential source of capital.
The speculation had been depressing the Coles share price, and Kmart
suggested yesterday that Coles' directors had decided to take matters into
their own hands.
Mr Joseph E Antonini, Kmart chairman, said Kmart's board had analysed
various alternatives for the investment. 'Kmart has decided to be responsive
to the approach from Coles Myer and give them the opportunity to complete
this transaction which we believe is in the interest of both companies,' he
said.
Kmart said later the deal had no bearing on the issue of what would happen
to Kmart's specialty retailing operations. Shareholders want Kmart to sell
them outright to concentrate on putting its ailing discount stores to
rights. Kmart's board has yet to reach a decision.
The sale of the Coles stake will be undertaken in two parts, both
conditional. First, Coles plans to directly buy back, then cancel, just
under 10 per cent of its own capital at ADollars 4.55 a share, costing
ADollars 587m.
Second, Coles has undertaken to try to find a purchaser for the remaining
11.45 per cent Kmart stake through Barclays de Zoete Wedd Australia, the
investment bank, also at ADollars 4.55 a share, valuing the parcel at
ADollars 672m.

FT  22 JUL 94 / International Company News: Metall Mining chafes over
majority stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metall Mining, the inter- national mining arm of Metallgesellschaft, is
growing increasingly impatient at delays in the sale of a 50.1 per cent
controlling stake in itself held by the ailing German industrial group.
Metallgesellschaft has indicated that it plans to spin off its stake in
Metall through a public offering as part of efforts to improve its
liquidity. Metall and its financial advisers are eager to take advantage of
the recent surge in copper prices to go ahead with the sale.
'The market is indicating that it would be receptive,' one Toronto
securities dealer said yesterday.
Metallgesellschaft's stake in Metall has a market value of about CDollars
465m (USDollars 336.9m). The main stumbling block however, is a convoluted
arrangement involving Metall's 35 per cent stake in Norddeutsche Affinerie,
one of Europe's largest copper smelters.
Metall is also understood to be frustrated at recent management changes at
Metallgesellschaft's head office in Frankfurt, which have blurred lines of
communication. The discussions on Metall's future also involve numerous
creditors to whom Metallgesellschaft has pledged its Metall shares as
collateral.
'There are more than two parties and each has its own agenda,' one person
familiar with the talks said.
Metall's partners in Norddeutsche Affinerie are MIM, the Australian mining
group, and Degussa, the German metals company. Metall acquired its interest
from Metallgesellschaft last September as part of a rationalisation of the
German parent's metals business before its present troubles surfaced.
MIM and Degussa demanded assurances at the time that the Canadian company's
stake would revert to Metallgesellschaft if the seemingly healthy German
group were to sever its ties with Metall. Metallgesellschaft would be
obliged to pay Metall a fair market price for the assets.
Metall has so far been unable to obtain a waiver of this arrangement from
its partners.

FT  22 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Telemetrix shows 35% fall to Pounds 5.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Telemetrix, the UK-based supplier of specialised electronic components,
yesterday blamed a price war in North America for a 35 per cent decline in
interim profits.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 7.9m to Pounds 5.2m for the six months to
June 30; the group said it was a victim of a 17 per cent decline in average
US component prices in the second quarter.
GTI Corporation, the 58 per cent-owned US subsidiary and largest division,
endured the brunt of the downturn. Operating profits fell from Dollars 9.7m
to Dollars 4.2m (Pounds 2.7m).
Although demand for networking components supplied by Valor, GTI's main
subsidiary, grew by 25 per cent, turnover in North America was virtually
unchanged at Pounds 43.3m - representing the bulk of the group total of
Pounds 65.5m (Pounds 61.5m).
Mr Tim Curtis, chief executive, accused US competitors of selling components
at unsustainable margins, but claimed that Telemetrix was strong enough to
sit out the price war.
'Our competitors are pricing in a stupid way, it cannot last. But GTI must
move its product mix from lower to higher margin components.'
The company has also increased capacity to meet growing demand, by opening
new plants in the Philippines and China.
Falling profits in North America were offset partly by an improved
performance by Zetex and Trend, the two wholly owned UK subsidiaries.
Zetex increased operating profits from Pounds 1.25m to Pounds 1.4m, while
Trend's contribution rose by 43 per cent to Pounds 975,000.
Mr Curtis said both companies had enjoyed improved margins and were
benefiting from sales of innovative products to the semi-conductor and
telecommunications sectors.
Increased cash generation by the UK companies helped lift bank reserves from
Pounds 9.31m to Pounds 11.9m. Mr Curtis said those funds would be used for
product development and technology acquisitions in markets such as Germany.
Earnings per share fell to 3.1p (3.8p) and the company continued its
practice of not paying an interim dividend.

FT  22 JUL 94 / UK Company News: B&amp;J loss deepens after restructuring costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brown &amp; Jackson, the owner of the Poundstretcher chain of discount stores
which was recently rescued by Pepkor, the South African retail group, showed
pre-tax losses of Pounds 12.7m for the six months to June 30.
The deficit, Pounds 1.3m greater than last time, included professional costs
of Pounds 1.4m for the financial restructuring. Turnover from continuing
operations was little changed at Pounds 57m.
Pepkor, which could inject up to Pounds 56.2m in return for a 63 per cent
stake in B&amp;J, said it had started its own review of the business. Changes
had already been made to reduce costs, increase stock densities and improve
net margins.
Financial difficulties since the year-end had led to some suppliers delaying
supplies, severely affecting customer service levels.
Losses per share were cut from 2.5p to 2p.

FT  22 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Hill &amp; Smith ahead to Pounds 1.74m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hill &amp; Smith Holdings, the West Midlands-based building products and steel
fabrications company, announced a 17 per cent expansion in interim profits
as it built upon a steady showing in the first quarter.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to March 31 amounted to Pounds 1.74m,
against Pounds 1.48m. Sales advanced by a commensurate amount to Pounds
36.7m, an improvement that took place wholly in the second quarter,
according to Mr John Silk, chairman.
The turnover advance, however, led to the figure for debtors rising to
Pounds 23.8m at the period end, up from Pounds 18.1m at September 30. This,
coupled with the decision to buy forward in steel and zinc, saw gearing rise
from 16.5 per cent to 34 per cent during the same period, although it had
since fallen, Mr Silk said.
Building products for the housing sector and manhole covers for the
communications industry benefited from increased activity to show
'significant improvements' in profits, he added, although better margins in
drainage products in the UK were partly offset by reduced sales in France.
Increased volumes helped the steel stockholding side to swing into a modest
profit, while the barrier and fencing operation maintained margins despite
declining demand. Forging failed to show any improvement on its previous
showing in spite of a 'reasonable order book', Mr Silk said.
The interim dividend is 2.1p, an effective increase of 10 per cent following
the 1-for-10 scrip issue in March, covered 1.67 times by earnings of 3.51p
(2.99p) per share.

FT  22 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Saville Gordon jumps to Pounds 5.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of J Saville Gordon, the property group with merchanting interests,
yesterday rose 5p to 68p following the announcement of more than doubled
pre-tax profits and its first dividend increase for five years.
Pre-tax profits for the year to April 30 advanced from Pounds 2.35m to
Pounds 5.6m.
Earnings per share were 3.9p (1.4p). Although the final dividend was
unchanged at 1.7p, the total for the 12 months was 2.7p, against 2.2p for
the previous four financial years.
Turnover on continuing operations rose to Pounds 30.6m (Pounds 23.1m). The
progress was helped by a rise of nearly Pounds 3m to Pounds 18.7m in sales
of pipeline equipment, the resumption, after a year's absence from the
market, of property trading sales at Pounds 4.19m, and increased property
rental income as rent reviews produced higher revenue.
This year's rental income should be higher following the purchase of a
shopping centre and a portfolio from NFC, while demand is increasing on the
merchanting side.
Net asset value advanced to 58.3p (47.4p).

The group, which intends to finance the deal through a placing and open
offer, also reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 346,000 for the period from

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Price increases and strong demand for hire vehicles helped Goode Durrant,
the industrial holding company, to more than double profits before
exceptionals from Pounds 4.5m to Pounds 9.6m for the year to April 30.
Turnover fell by 42 per cent to Pounds 101m, largely due to disposals. Sales
from continuing businesses rose by 11 per cent to Pounds 64.6m. At the
pre-tax level profits came out at Pounds 10.6m, against losses of Pounds
15.4m.
Mr Michael Waring, chief executive, said the group's strategy of focusing on
the commercial vehicle and equipment hire business had been vindicated.
Since the year end, there had been signs of increased activity. Most
important, the equipment and storage hire businesses had pushed through rate
increases for the first time in many years.
As a result, the final dividend is increased by 17 per cent to 3.8p, for a
total 11 per cent higher at 6p (5.4p).
Northgate, the commercial vehicle rental group which contributes about 80
per cent of the group's pre-tax profit, had held 4 per cent price increases
last year. A further 4 per cent rise was introduced this year. Operating
profits in this division rose by 77 per cent to Pounds 11m.
Mr Waring said there was a trend among customers towards hiring a greater
proportion of their fleets.
Goode Durrant's equipment hire division increased operating profits by 90
per cent to Pounds 918,000 while the housebuilding division, which has been
pegged for disposal, held profits at Pounds 710,000 (Pounds 705,000).
Earnings were 14.5p, against losses of 31.2p. Excluding the Pounds 20m in
exceptional and non-recurring items taken in 1993, earnings rose from 5.8p
to 12.7p.

Dana Exploration, the Dublin-based metals exploration group, is acquiring TM
Oil Production, a company involved in oil and gas exploration and production
activities in Russia. The purchase follows an option entered into last
October.
Consideration will be met by the allotment to the vendors of 75m new
ordinary Dana shares following completion, with either a further issue of
20m new shares or payment of Dollars 450,000 (Pounds 296,000) within 90 days
of completion, at Dana's election.
Dana is also raising about IPounds 2.17m (Pounds 2.15m) through an 11-for-5
rights issue of 52.4m new ordinary shares at 5p each. The proceeds will
provide funding for the enlarged group.
The issue is fully underwritten by T Hoare, with Money Markets International
as broker.
At the same time the company announced pre-tax losses of IPounds 18,207 for
the 11 months to December 31, being entirely administrative expenses. For
the year to January 1993 there were profits of IPounds 1.22m after
exceptional credits of IPounds 1.24m.
Losses per share were 0.76p, compared with earniongs last time of 15.32p.
TM Oil's has an agreement with a group of Russian companies to develop and
produce oil reserves in western Siberia.

Turnover for the USM-quoted hardware manufacturer rose from Pounds 15.1m to
Pounds 16.2m, though trading margins were squeezed - operating profits

After a reduced interest charge, pre-tax profits rose 12 per cent, from
Pounds 713,000 to Pounds 801,000, with earnings per share up 8 per cent at

Increased seasonal stocking was offset by improved debt collection, leaving

The final dividend is unchanged at 3.65p, making a total of 5.61p (5.45p)
for the year.

<TEXT>
Exceptional profits from the sale of a subsidiary and associated companies
enabled Southend Property Holdings to report pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.03m
for the year to end-March, against Pounds 513,000.
During the year, net asset value increased slightly to 94.2p, the company
said. The shares added 5p to close at 70p.
Operating profit advanced to Pounds 13.3m, against Pounds 12.7m which
included Pounds 295,000 from discontinued activities. However, there was a
profit of Pounds 3.94m (Pounds 36,000) on sales of investments in
subsidiaries and associates, offset by a loss on disposal of investment
properties.
The sales mean that for the first time in many years the figures from
non-property activities will not now be consolidated. In the year under
review the figures included only six months from Mt Martin Gold Mines.
Turnover was Pounds 22.2m, compared with Pounds 31.8m which included Pounds
4.19m from discontinued activities in non-property trading.
Earnings per share were 4.13p (losses 0.58p). A final dividend of 1.6p is
recommended for a total of 2.4p (4.25p).

</HEADLINE>

Shares in YRM fell 5p to 17p after the building design consultancy reported
its second consecutive annual loss and again passed its final dividend.
On turnover down from Pounds 14.1m to Pounds 9.7m, pre-tax losses for the
year to April 30 deepened from Pounds 1.98m to Pounds 2.84m.
After a tax refund of Pounds 163,000 (Pounds 315,000) the retained loss was
Pounds 2.68m (Pounds 1.7m) and per share 20.27p (12.58p).
Directors said that competition and fee tendering for available projects
remained intense, and the need to reduce overheads had led to further
redundancies involving costs of Pounds 420,000 (Pounds 358,000).
YRM's overdraft facility has recently been extended to November and the
auditors do not intend to qualify their opinion on the group's financial
statements in this respect.
They do, however, intend to make reference to fundamental uncertainty
relating to the going concern basis and to the Hotel Praha project, again
without qualification of their opinion.

FT  22 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Sime Darby sets its sights on Europe with
purchase of Lec
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sime Darby, the Malaysia-based conglomerate and one of south-east Asia's
biggest multinationals, announced its first foray into manufacturing in
Europe with the proposed acquisition of Lec Refrigeration, the West
Sussex-based refrigeration equipment manufacturer.
Lec's main shareholders with 51.97 per cent of its equity, including the
trustees of the estate of Mr Charles Purley, the company's founder, the
trustees of the Purley Family Trust, and Candy Holdings, have accepted the
cash offer of 358p per share, which values the company at Pounds 21.7m.
The offer represents a premium of 21.4 per cent over the middle market price
of 295p per Lec share.
Mr Nik Mohamed, group chief executive of Sime Darby, said Lec's white goods
brand name would complement the company's operations and provide it with
manufacturing capacity in Europe. He added that Sime's financial resources
would enable Lec to expand its product range and penetrate new markets.
Mr Don Durrant, Lec finance director, said the deal would allow Lec to
implement its planned Pounds 13m investment in new plant and machinery over
the next three years.
Lec reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 838,000 in 1993 against losses of
Pounds 2.86m the previous year on turnover of Pounds 37m (Pounds 41m). It
employs 930 workers.
Although Sime has extensive international exposure, including divisions in
Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore, the Philippines and Australia, the
acquisition provides it with its first manufacturing base in Europe.
Sime operates 200 companies, employing 30,000 people worldwide. It reported
pre-tax profits of MDollars 840m (Pounds 215m) against MDollars 755m on
turnover of MDollars 7bn (MDollars 6.2bn) in the year to June 30 1993.

FT  22 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Boots rises 4% in first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boots, the chemist, retailing and pharmaceuticals group, confirmed the
picture of moderate recovery in retail sales with news that its sales were
up 4.4 per cent in the first quarter of its financial year.
Some analysts were disappointed by the figures - particularly a 5.3 per cent
fall in total sales at Do It All, the DIY joint venture with WH Smith - and
the shares ended 13 1/2 p down at 522p.
The size of the fall, however, was said to be largely due to a programme
sale of retail stocks by an institutional investor.
Sir Christopher Benson, at his last annual meeting as chairman before
handing over to Sir Michael Angus, said sales were satisfactory in a
'difficult if improving environment'.
Total sales at Boots the Chemists were up 4.2 per cent, with like-for-like
sales, which exclude new store openings, up 2.8 per cent.
High-margin health and beauty and personal care products were up 8 per cent,
and although sales of toiletries had been affected by poor weather in June,
they recovered in July.
Among the other retailing businesses, Boots Opticians lifted sales 8.9 per
cent, Halfords 7.6 per cent, and Childrens World 19.4 per cent.
However, sales at AG Stanley, which operates the Fads home decorating
stores, were down 0.4 per cent, and Do It All was down 5.3 per cent in a DIY
market described as 'dull'.
On the pharmaceuticals side, the prescription drugs business increased sales
6.4 per cent, helped by a strong performance from Synthroid, the thyroid
treatment, in the US.
Boots Healthcare International, the over-the-counter drugs business, also
improved sales by 6.4 per cent.
However, sales at Boots Contract Manufacturing fell 3.6 per cent, largely
due to the withdrawal of the Manoplax heart drug which it was manufacturing
last year.

FT  22 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Shoprite shares halve to 30p on warning -
'Disappointing' trading performance and store openings curtailed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Shoprite, the Scottish discount food retailer, halved in value
yesterday after the group issued a profits warning and said it was 'severely
curtailing' its store opening programme for this year.
The statement - which came less than two months after the group revealed
half-year profits substantially below market expectations - knocked the
shares down from 60p to 30p. They reached a high of 243p in February.
Mr Charles Good, managing director for Scotland, said trading had remained
'extremely difficult' since the interim announcement, and sales had not
reached their anticipated levels.
'On the cost side we have made very big strides and our problems are not on
that front', he said. 'Margin management has also been good. The problem is
that our actual trading performance has been disappointing.'
As a result, profits for the year to October were expected to fall
'significantly short of expectations' given at the time of the interim
result, when Shoprite said they were likely to be about the same level as
last year.
Shoprite has also decided to reduce its opening programme for this year
strictly to those stores to which it is already committed, and expects to
open a further 24, taking the chain to 107. That will make 44 total openings
for the year compared with the 50-plus previously expected.
The group has also begun moves to dispose of its portfolio of non-core
assets, which have a book value of about Pounds 17m.
Mr Good said a marketing and promotion campaign designed to counter the
price-cutting initiatives of superstore rivals had been delayed but was
about to begin, and was expected to produce an uplift in sales.
Initiatives to cut overheads and improve margins through better product mix
and buying would continue, and the board had initiated a strategic review,
he added.
The group had also renegotiated its banking facilities following the failure
last month of a sale and leaseback deal on 11 of its stores on to a 'secured
and on demand basis' pending completion of the strategic review.
The company expected to begin negotiations for the provision of revised
facilities after the review.

FT  22 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Car safety fears behind First Technology
advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mounting concern over vehicle safety helped First Technology, which supplies
sensors and crash dummies to the car industry, sharply increase
profitability.
Pre-tax profits jumped by 76 per cent to Pounds 4.1m in the year to April
30. Sales were 31 per cent higher at Pounds 34m, with overseas sales
accounting for 89 per cent of the total.
The shares rose 14p to 319p.
The automotive electronics division, which accounts for 75 per cent of
profits and turnover, benefited from strong car sales in America and the
rapid growth of new business in Europe. Sales were up 43 per cent.
The group said its fuel cut-off sensors were being fitted by Fiat,
Peugeot/Citroen and one other unnamed manufacturer, which together could
eventually add up to a total of 5m vehicles a year.
The safety and crash division, which supplies dummies to manufacturers,
increased profits on only marginally-increased sales. The group said the
current year had started well. New product launches included child dummies
and a pregnant woman.
First Technology said that in North America and certain parts of Europe,
including the UK, key economic indicators looked good for the medium term.
In most markets, the economic position was finely poised between recession
and the first signs of recovery.
Mr Fred Westlake, chairman, said: 'Overall, we believe the outlook is more
encouraging than it has been for a considerable period of time.'
He said the group was interested in developing its sensor business in Japan
 -probably through a joint venture or licensing arrangement with a local
manufacturer.
Earnings per share increased by 61 per cent to 17.33p (10.75p). A final
dividend of 2.5p makes a total for the year of 3.5p (1p).
COMMENT
Car safety trends seem to be going First Technology's way, and an increasing
number of European manufacturers are joining the US leaders in fitting the
group's fuel cut-off sensor to their vehicles. The fall in gearing from 52
per cent to 19 per cent means the group can even consider making
acquisitions again, although only closely related business would be
considered. A more immediate prospect is expansion through a joint venture
in Japan, where the group currently has no exposure. Forecast profits of
Pounds 4.7m put the shares on a prospective multiple of 16 - in line with
the sector. Given the orders outlook, they look good value - and the group's
niche market position could also make it an attractive acquisition target.

FT  22 JUL 94 / British &amp; Commonwealth Collapse: The DTI Report - Other key
executives censured by government inspectors
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Gunn built British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings into a company worth Pounds
2.5bn in a few furiously busy years in the 1980s. But his purchase of
Atlantic Computers, a deeply flawed company, proved his undoing. B&amp;C crashed
in 1990 with Pounds 1bn in liabilities. Suits and counter-suits against
advisers are seeking some Pounds 3.5bn in compensation
Apart from Mr John Gunn, B&amp;C's chairman, the other B&amp;C directors facing
disqualification are Mr Peter Goldie and Mr Rusty Ashman.
Mr Gunn and Mr Goldie, who were close colleagues for some years, made a
slightly odd couple, the short often rumpled Mr Gunn contrasting with the
tall, suave Mr Goldie.
A chartered accountant Mr Goldie founded Abaco, a group of professional and
financial services companies, which B&amp;C bought for Pounds 189m in 1987.
He has not returned to business since B&amp;C's collapse and after taking a
philosophy degree at London University is now doing a doctorate at Balliol
College, Oxford.
Mr Ashman, another chartered accountant, joined B&amp;C as finance director in
October 1987. He was previously finance director at Abaco.
The inspectors are also seeking the disqualification of three directors of
Atlantic Computers: Mr David McCormick, its chief executive from its
acquisition by B&amp;C until his suspension in 1990; and Mr Nicholas Kennedy
Scott and Mrs Sien Yin Cheng Kai On who held senior financial positions.
Mr McCormick, an autocratic entrepreneur, founded ICA, a Dutch-based leasing
business, in 1977. It sold a similar product to Atlantic's Flexlease though
with much greater controls and more conservative accounting. Atlantic
acquired ICA in December, 1986.
Unlike the other Atlantic directors facing disqualification Mr McCormick was
a salesman not an accountant.
But the inspectors state that:'Even allowing for Mr McCormick's lack of
accounting expertise and for the fact that he was out of his depth as chief
executive of such a large group as Atlantic, we consider that he is open to
criticism for misjudging the situation and for not discussing Atlantic's
exposure problems in specific terms with B&amp;C before April 1989.'
The inspectors say he was in breach of his duties as a director for failing
to ensure that disclosure was made to Atlantic's auditors and for approving
its 1988 accounts.
Mr Kennedy Scott joined Atlantic in February, 1987, when it acquired Comcap,
another quoted computer leasing company where he was joint managing
director.
A chartered accountant with 10 years' experience of the computer leasing
industry he had joined Comcap in 1980 as finance director.
Comcap had a reputation as a much more cautious company than Atlantic with
much more conservative accounting policies.
The inspectors say he adopted a 'supine' attitude as group finance director
of Atlantic which did not change when he became executive chairman on a
salary of Pounds 175,000.
They found his claim that he only became aware of the scale of Atlantic's
contingent liabilities in 1989 'astonishing'.
For not drawing B&amp;C's attention to Atlantic's exposure he is 'open to
serious criticism for not properly discharging his responsibilities as a
director both of Atlantic and B&amp;C'.
Mrs Cheng is the least known of the individuals facing disqualification as
directors.
She qualified as an accountant in 1976 and was the audit senior with Rowland
Nevill - now Moores Rowland - on the 1977 Atlantic audit.
The firm was Atlantic's auditors from formation until the completion of the
1982 accounts. Mrs Cheng was taken on by Atlantic as chief accountant in
1978, reporting to its co-founders Mr Vernon Davies and Mr John Foulston.
Mrs Cheng became finance director of Atlantic after the takeover.
The inspectors concluded that she must have known that the statement in
Atlantic's flotation prospectus regarding the proportion of Atlantic leases
which contained walk clauses was incorrect.
They said:'Mrs Cheng is not assertive and we accept that in her early days
with Atlantic she would have round it difficult to stand up to Mr Foulston
and Mr Davies and that she therefore acquiesced in Atlantic's aggressive
accounting policies.'
However they concluded that she acted in breach of her duties as a director
in failing to disclose to the auditors the magnitude of the contingent
liabilities.

Mr Vernon Davies was a co-architect of the leasing scheme which dragged down
Atlantic Computers but he lived very much in the shadow of his more forceful
partner Mr John Foulston.
The inspectors found that Mr Davies 'deliberately deceived' Spicer &amp;
Oppenheim and Rothschilds, Atlantic's auditors and financial adviser, over
the extent of the company's liabilities. If the truth had been known, the
flotation could not have proceeded, the inspectors concluded.
Mr Davies avoided being listed for disqualification as a director but
nevertheless yesterday hit out at the inspectors' report: 'I believe the
inspectors have been less than fair with me and I think they were totally
unjustified in the conclusions they reached.'
He was well rewarded for his time with Atlantic. He made Pounds 1m from
share sales to Messrs Jagger and Skinner who took a 60 per cent stake in the
company, Pounds 3.9m from the flotation, and Pounds 13m when he finally sold
out of the business in 1986.
Mr Davies stood as a Conservative candidate in the Sheffield Central
constituency in the April, 1992, General Election. He polled just 5,470
votes and lost to Labour candidate Mr Richard Caborn who polled 22,764
votes.
He is thought to be seeking a safe seat to fight at the next general
election.

censure offers insight into auditing / Auditors criticised
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
John Gunn built British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings into a company worth Pounds
2.5bn in a few furiously busy years in the 1980s. But his purchase of
Atlantic Computers, a deeply flawed company, proved his undoing. B&amp;C crashed
in 1990 with Pounds 1bn in liabilities. Suits and counter-suits against
advisers are seeking some Pounds 3.5bn in compensation
Yesterday's DTI report on the accountants involved with Atlantic Computers
and British &amp; Commonwealth includes a powerful criticism of one firm, and
strong remarks about two others in a rare insight into the audit process.
Singled out for most criticism is Spicer &amp; Oppenheim, now part of Touche
Ross, which became auditor to Atlantic in preparation for the company's
float in 1983, and remained until June 1989.
The DTI inspectors say that, in a report produced in 1983, the firm failed
to carry out sufficient investigative work as specified in their terms of
reference, and did not take adequate steps to verify the information
provided to them.
They criticise Spicer's report on Atlantic's working capital forecast at the
time of the company's takeover by B&amp;C in 1988. They say no account was taken
of Atlantic's trading and funding difficulties and that the firm did not
follow up concerns raised in a report by a subsidiary auditor on the
possible need to provide for losses on lease contracts.
During 1983 to 1987, Spicer planned its audits without sufficient
understanding of the risks of the company, relied too heavily on Atlantic's
own accounting control systems when it knew their weaknesses, and did not
consider sufficiently the recommendations about risks identified by KPMG
Peat Marwick, auditor of several subsidiaries.
The 1988 audit placed excessive reliance on Atlantic's internal controls,
did not justify the introduction of a higher level of 'materiality' beyond
which concerns would have been flagged, did not set adequate objectives and
was 'poorly conducted' in a number of areas.
The inspectors say stock was not properly confirmed, a planned circular of
debtors not carried out, incorrect conclusions drawn from reconciliations
between equipment and lease income, and sections of the audit file not
adequately reviewed or detailed to show significant problems met during the
audit.
The inspectors suggest that Spicer was inclined to accept problems as not
material and include them in the post-audit letter, rather than raise them
with Atlantic before providing audit clearance.
They conclude that the Spicer audit was conducted in good faith and that
there was no evidence to suggest there was any collusion with Atlantic. But
they stress that the firm was responsible for the audit and should have
designed procedures to identify and address the areas of risk.
Touche Ross distanced itself from the conclusions of the report last night
and stressed that matters relating to Spicer were 'ring-fenced'. It is
believed that the engagement partner at Spicer for Atlantic had not joined
Touche when the two firms merged in 1990.
Spicer said last night: 'The partners disagree with much of what the
inspectors say about them. They do not believe that anything Spicer did
caused the collapse of Atlantic or B&amp;C to buy it. The real story is not
about them but about corporate governance.'
The DTI also considered the role of three other firms of accountants.
Rowland Nevill, now part of Moores Rowland, was instrumental in the
formation of Atlantic in 1975 and acted as auditors of the company until
1982.
The inspectors concluded that recollections from so long ago were hazy, that
the company was in its infancy and that a balanced and objective assessment
of the audit would be impracticable.
They considered the role of Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells, now part of Coopers &amp;
Lybrand, which was auditor of B&amp;C during the period of its involvement with
Atlantic.
They expressed 'surprise' that Deloitte relied so heavily on Spicer's audit
of Atlantic's accounts when they should have been aware that the company was
a high-risk audit. They said a careful reading of Spicer's audit files
should have alerted Deloitte to deficiencies in the accounts.
There was no criticism of Deloitte's role in the 1989 interim statement, nor
of its review of Atlantic's accounting policies following its acquisition -
since they were instructed by their client not to complete the review.
KPMG, which took over as auditors of Atlantic from Spicer in 1989,
identified the problem of Atlantic's exposure to potential liabilities
early, and were justified in accepting assurances by company's directors
that the exposure was dealt with, inspectors say.
However, they say there was 'an unfortunate lack of clarity' in framing its
audit opinions, which did not communicate its reservations in a way that was
picked up by Spicer. The inspectors blame 'lack of perceptiveness' on
Spicer's part rather than criticising KPMG on the matter.
Atlantic Computers and Atlantic Computer Systems, Investigation under
Section 432 of the Companies Act 1985, HMSO, Pounds 35
'In our view Spicers' failings had their origin in Spicers' inability to
establish credibility and influence with Atlantic at the very beginning of
their involvement in the days of Mr (John) Foulston. (Co-founder of
Atlantic). This led to a passive relationship in which Spicers would be
challenged rather than consulted. From the outset Spicers did not have a
sufficient understanding of Atlantic's business, and in particular of
Flexlease and its attendant risks. Spicers failed to develop their knowledge
and understanding of the business at the same pace as the business itself
developed. This lack of understanding hindered the effectiveness of Spicers'
audit procedures such that by 1988 there were significant failures in the
approach and conduct of the audit.

FT  22 JUL 94 / British &amp; Commonwealth Collapse: The DTI Report - Financial
advisers criticised / Advisers' role
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
John Gunn built British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings into a company worth Pounds
2.5bn in a few furiously busy years in the 1980s. But his purchase of
Atlantic Computers, a deeply flawed company, proved his undoing. B&amp;C crashed
in 1990 with Pounds 1bn in liabilities. Suits and counter-suits against
advisers are seeking some Pounds 3.5bn in compensation
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the UK-based merchant bank, was criticised yesterday
by the Department of Trade and Industry for its role as the financial
adviser to collapsed British &amp; Commonwealth in its bid to acquire Atlantic
Computers - a bid which proved to be B&amp;C's undoing.
BZW's role is now the subject of a series of writs, and it in turn has
issued writs, in connection with events at Atlantic Computers and B&amp;C.
The thrust of the DTI's criticism of BZW is that even professional investors
could have been misled into thinking that BZW endorsed B&amp;C's view that the
purchase was a wise move. The circular asking B&amp;C shareholders to approve
the Atlantic acquisition said: 'Your directors, who have been advised by
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, believe that the acquisition of Atlantic is in the
best interests of stockholders.'
BZW told the DTI that this could not be taken as an endorsement of the
board's decision and said its role had been limited to offering financial
advice. The DTI concluded that on this more limited area - essentially a
co-ordinating and facilitating role in a bid - 'we have seen nothing to
suggest that BZW did not perform these functions in a wholly satisfactory
manner.'
Although the UK Takeover Code requires the target company to obtain
independent financial advice on behalf of shareholders, there is no
obligation on the part of acquiring companies. BZW had argued that this role
was understood by merchant banks in the City.
However, the DTI concluded that the wording of the circular would have led
most professional investors to assume it had actually taken a view on the
merits of the acquisition. The report noted that BZW invoiced B&amp;C for Pounds
600,000 in connection with arranging the bid and an additional Pounds
400,000 for other matters including 'an appraisal of Atlantic'.
The DTI concluded that BZW had adopted 'an insufficiently robust approach'
during its investigation of Atlantic.
The DTI also criticised Outram Cullinan &amp; Co, the strategy consultants now
owned by Coopers and Lybrand, for their role in evaluating the benefits of
the buy.
While noting that OC&amp;C had warned B&amp;C that its analysis was hindered by the
refusal of Atlantic to supply key information, it failed to reiterate that
at a B&amp;C board meeting where the decision to acquire Atlantic was made. In
its defence, Coopers said the firm had expected B&amp;C to undertake further due
diligence and it had not realised that the meeting was the one where the
decision to buy Atlantic would be taken.

FT  22 JUL 94 / British &amp; Commonwealth Collapse: The DTI Report - Never
quite became 'one of us' / Maverick Gunn

John Gunn built British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings into a company worth Pounds
2.5bn in a few furiously busy years in the 1980s. But his purchase of
Atlantic Computers, a deeply flawed company, proved his undoing. B&amp;C crashed
in 1990 with Pounds 1bn in liabilities. Suits and counter-suits against
advisers are seeking some Pounds 3.5bn in compensation
Mr John Gunn, the man who presided over Britain's biggest ever financial
collapse, has never quite fitted the part.
His downbeat style and air of moral seriousness always set him apart from
the other flamboyant dealmakers who built and lost empires in the 1980s.
Yet few could match the scale of his achievements or the disaster which came
in their wake.
In a few heady years he expanded British &amp; Commonwealth into a financial
services group worth Pounds 2.5bn only to see it fail with liabilities
Pounds 1.2bn.
The son of a Cheshire railwayman, he has never been quite accepted as 'one
of us' in the City, although at the height of his career he was the toast of
the town.
In his quiet determination and confidence in his abilities he has much in
common with his cricketing hero Geoffrey Boycott.
After studying German at Nottingham and Friburg Universities, where he met
his German wife and developed an interest in the country's literature and
stamps, Mr Gunn started his career in the foreign exchange department of
Barclays Bank in Manchester.
Eventually frustrated by his lack of promotion he moved to London and Astley
&amp; Pearce, a small money broker.
Some 11 years later he created Exco to buy Astley from its main shareholder,
Gerrard &amp; National.
Backing came from the wealthy Cayzer family, whose formidable reputation as
canny investors has only been enhanced by their association with Mr Gunn.
Exco was floated on the stock market in 1981 at a value of Pounds 60m. Five
years later, after a string of acquisitions, it was worth Pounds 500m.
In 1985 Mr Gunn walked out after disagreements with his boardroom
colleagues. Lord Cayzer, who had done very well out of Exco, offered him a
job at British &amp; Commonwealth, the conglomerate controlled by the family's
Caledonia Investments.
Once the UK's largest shipping company B&amp;C had developed into a highly
diversified holding company into which the Cayzers were trying to breathe
new life.
In 1986 Mr Gunn became chief executive, having convinced the family that the
group should concentrate on financial services.
'I can do what I want, more or less, subject to the agreement of the rest of
the board,' Mr Gunn said at the time and used that freedom for a Pounds 2bn
acquisition spree.
His first move was to buy Exco for Pounds 637m. Less than a year later he
spent Pounds 560m on Mercantile House which strengthened B&amp;C's presence in
fund management by adding Oppenheimer in the US to its own Gartmore
Investment Management in the UK.
'We are looking to build up the largest non-banking financial services
company in the UK,' he said. But as Mr Gunn celebrated that year's Pounds 1m
pay cheque the Cayzers were looking to sell.
In October 1987 B&amp;C agreed to buy back 25 per cent of its shares held by
Caledonia Investments for Pounds 427.5m.
The deal was based on a share price of 475p and was struck just days before
the stock market crash.
The shares quickly dropped by more than 150p and continued to fall steadily.
Three years later they were worthless.
In April 1988, at the age of 46, he received the Guardian Young Businessman
of the Year award. As so often happens, this marked the peak of his career
which started going badly wrong three months later with the Pounds 400m
acquisition of Atlantic Computers.
It is still debatable what would have happened to B&amp;C had it not bought
Atlantic. But there is no doubt that it would have experienced serious
financial difficulty in the recession.
Mr Gunn had constructed a group highly sensitive to interest rates with a
large amount of floating rate debt.
As the economy slowed Mr Gunn tried to shore up the balance sheet with
disposals.
'I am not much good at anything else apart from doing deals,' he said at the
time.
But he proved less adept at selling companies that buying them.
An agreement to sell two money brokers to Mr Gary Klesch's Quadrex fell
through. The failure recently led to a successful claim for Pounds 172m by
B&amp;C's administrators against Samuel Montagu. The merchant bank had provided
assurances that Quadrex had funds to pay for the deal which never
materialised.
In 1990, B&amp;C raised Pounds 140m from the sale of Gartmore, which recently
returned to the stock market.
However, when it was forced to write-off Pounds 550m as a result of the
collapse of Atlantic, the balance sheet could not take the strain.
Its bankers attempted to mount a rescue but when the Securities &amp;
Investments Board ordered firms to remove money from the British &amp;
Commonwealth Merchant Bank there was no option but to call in the
administrators.
The administrators froze Pounds 300m of deposits at the bank which prevented
investment companies from complying with the SIB order. Nearly half the
deposits represented client money placed there by other parts of B&amp;C which
included stockbrokers Stock Group.
At the time it was widely assumed that there would be little left for
creditors of the group, let alone shareholders. But the administration,
handled by partners of accountants Ernst &amp; Young, has been more successful
that expected.
Creditors of the merchant bank have already been repaid in full.
The flotations of Celltech, a biotechnology company, and most recently Exco
have brought in more than originally projected and creditors of the group's
finance subsidiary, owed more than Pounds 700m, could eventually get 29p in
the pound. Some banks which are creditors of more than one part of the group
should get around half their money back.
And the final figures could be higher still depending on the string of legal
actions the administrators have started. Since the collapse Mr Gunn has
develop a new career as a 'business angel' investing in and helping small
companies. He also has two non-executive directorships at public companies,
Midland &amp; Scottish Resources and Glenchewton.
He said yesterday he would continue to pursue these interests at the same
time as vigorously defending himself against the disqualification action.
'In my career I have been a director of literally hundreds of companies and
only had one problem.'
He accused the inspectors of 'errors and selectivity' in presenting the
evidence and expressed 'astonishment' at their conclusions given that they
say that he acted in what he thought was the best interests of shareholders.
'I am hardly mentioned when they describe what happened and then they go on
and blame me for it.' He also attacked the move to disqualify him and the
five others as directors which 'lumps us all together in a way not
sustainable on the evidence'.
He was particularly bitter about the criticism that the B&amp;C directors should
have alerted shareholders to the problems at Atlantic as soon as they came
to light. 'We took what I think was the right prudent approach to try to
find out first exactly what the situation was. But in this case anything we
did would have been wrong. It was like a Greek tragedy, damned if we did and
damned if we didn't'

of resolving legal tangle / Writs fly

John Gunn built British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings into a company worth Pounds
2.5bn in a few furiously busy years in the 1980s. But his purchase of
Atlantic Computers, a deeply flawed company, proved his undoing. B&amp;C crashed
in 1990 with Pounds 1bn in liabilities. Suits and counter-suits against
advisers are seeking some Pounds 3.5bn in compensation
The DTI report into Atlantic Computers looks set to have a substantial
impact on the complex raft of legal actions spawned by British &amp;
Commonwealth's disastrous acquisition.
A welter of large-scale litigation - with over 70 claims and counter-claims
totalling well in excess of Pounds 3bn - has been prompted by the affair.
Most leading London law firms are involved in acting for somebody caught in
the legal cross-fire. The litigation, should it ever reach court, would
prove exceptionally complex, exhausting and expensive.
The report is now being closely studied by the lawyers concerned. The
amending or even dropping of some of the actions is considered possible.
Yesterday, both lawyers and their clients were refusing to comment publicly
on the possible impact of the report on their individual legal actions.
However, there was private agreement that it could act to partially resolve
what is rapidly becoming a legal mess.
'Clearly there is now a need to re-examine the whole situation in the light
of the report,' said one participant in the legal battles.
In its conclusions, the report makes little or no criticism of the
professional advisers involved in the acquisition of Atlantic Computers by
B&amp;C, apart from Spicer &amp; Oppenheim, the computer company's auditors.
This lack of criticism could affect one of the largest actions outstanding -
that brought by Ernst &amp; Young, the British &amp; Commonwealth administrators,
against Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the securities arm of Barclays. In this
action, the administrators are suing BZW for approaching Pounds 1bn. The
auditors are alleging BZW was negligent in carrying out its role as adviser
to B&amp;C over the acquisition.
Ernst &amp; Young have also brought the other main claim in the welter of
litigation - a similar Pounds 1bn action against former Atlantic directors
including Mr David McCormick, the former chief executive, Mr John Tompkins,
his predecessor and Mr John Gillum, a former Atlantic chairman. In both
cases, the writs have been issued, but the actions are still in their very
early stages and no date has yet been fixed for them to reach court.
It was these claims by Ernst &amp; Young which effectively triggered the flurry
of other writs, as other parties responded by launching their own actions to
protect themselves or creditors.
BZW responded to the administrators' claims by mounting its own series of
actions. These are against OC&amp;C, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, NM Rothchild and Spicer
&amp; Oppenheim, along with three former Atlantic directors, Mr Tompkins, Mr
Nicholas Kennedy-Scott and Mr McCormick. BZW has yet to put a figure on the
scale of these claims.
In further actions, Price Waterhouse, the Atlantic administrators, are suing
Spicer &amp; Oppenheim and former directors of the computer company - again for
sums approaching a total of Pounds 1bn.
It will be some months before the impact of the DTI report on the mountain
of litigation becomes clear.
But, as one litigant put it: 'It has become horrendous. Everyone is going
around in circles. We have got to find a way of simplifying this, otherwise
we will be arguing for years. The DTI report will clarify some of the
issues. It could trigger more claims, but hopefully it may simplify this
mess.'

FT  22 JUL 94 / British &amp; Commonwealth Collapse: The DTI Report - Leasing
liabilities that led to downfall / Flawed leases

John Gunn built British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings into a company worth Pounds
2.5bn in a few furiously busy years in the 1980s. But his purchase of
Atlantic Computers, a deeply flawed company, proved his undoing. B&amp;C crashed
in 1990 with Pounds 1bn in liabilities. Suits and counter-suits against
advisers are seeking some Pounds 3.5bn in compensation
The heart of Atlantic Computer's dramatic rise and fall was the Flexlease,
which provided the basis for almost all of the group's computer leasing
business.
Flexlease was designed to give a company the benefits of taking a long-term
lease over a computer system, together with the flexibility to break that
lease at what appeared to be a minimal extra cost.
The basic lease had an average life of six years, and comprised an agreement
between a bank or other funder, and the party acquiring the system.
However, there was a separate management agreement, whereby Atlantic
provided an opt-out for the lessor. Under some agreements, the system could
either be returned to Atlantic in exchange for the replacement equipment (a
flex), and in others it could be terminated (a walk).
The Flex was generally triggered after three years, and the Walk after five
years. An increasing number of leases included both options.
Atlantic's sole means of mitigating losses from this area was by selling the
machinery, and generating a profitable replacement lease on a Flex.
Since the fall in the value of second-hand computer equipment was more rapid
than the outstanding lease obligations, this was a dangerous tie-up.
Atlantic had a hidden weapon: the Flex agreement was worded so as to be, in
the judgment of the investigators, legally unenforceable by the customer.
While it enabled an early break 'at no penalty', it also allowed for the
interpretation that subsequent losses could be recovered through the terms
of the new lease.
Ultimately, the only way Flexlease could remain profitable was by ensuring
sufficient new sales to cover its ballooning liabilities. The collapse of
the company that devised it was all but inevitable.

FT  22 JUL 94 / British &amp; Commonwealth Collapse: The DTI Report - The
pyramid structure that got out of control / Atlantic's rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Gunn built British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings into a company worth Pounds
2.5bn in a few furiously busy years in the 1980s. But his purchase of
Atlantic Computers, a deeply flawed company, proved his undoing. B&amp;C crashed
in 1990 with Pounds 1bn in liabilities. Suits and counter-suits against
advisers are seeking some Pounds 3.5bn in compensation
The most extraordinary feature of the collapse of Atlantic Computers was
that it did not happen earlier.
Founded in 1975 by two computer industry colleagues, it grew into a Pounds
500m business within 12 years, but the commercial core of the business was
fundamentally rotten from the start.
By the time British &amp; Commonwealth bought into Atlantic for Pounds 408m in
1988, Mr Vernon Davies had long lost interest in the business and the more
aggressive Mr John Foulston had been killed in a motor racing crash.
But the pyramid sale structure was out of control and could only be propped
up by some highly questionable accounting policies, and an obsessive
emphasis on increasing the level of sales, at any cost.
One of the more disturbing details to emerge from yesterday's report is the
extent to which profits were propped up by 'imprudent' accounting between
1983 and 1988, the inspectors conclude.
Atlantic reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 127.6m. If prudent policies had
been followed, it would not have been able to report 'any significant
profits during that period'.
Atlantic was formed after Mr Foulston and Mr Davies spotted a niche in what
was the boom sector of the latter half of the 1970s - computer leasing.
The two men had worked together at Memorex UK for four years, and initially
set up a consultancy and peripherals supplier, but then moved into leasing.
At the time, lessors of substantial computing systems were faced with the
choice of long-term leases, which provided cheap finance, but offered no
ability to upgrade during a period of rapid technological change. The
alternative was a far more expensive short-term lease.
Atlantic devised the Flexlease. As the report states: 'the raison d'etre of
Flexlease was the aversion of both lessors and lessees to the risks inherent
in residual investments in computers, and the apparent success of Flexlease
lay in the fact that Atlantic was prepared to assume those risks.'
The flaw to this equation was that, whether or not it was actually aware of
the level of its risks, it certainly never revealed them, and its
liabilities snowballed.
The man in control of the group was undoubtedly Mr Foulston. He was
nominally in charge of the sales side of the business, but he increasingly
dominated its entire strategy.
Mr Len Jagger and Mr Ian Skipper, the businessmen who took a 60 per cent
stake in Atlantic in June 1982, told the inspectors that their main
consideration was 'the energy, ambition and determination' of Mr Foulston.
Mr Davies handled company finances, despite having a sales rather than
accounting background, but despite being in the shadow of his powerful
partner, the report concludes that both men kept a tight control over the
business.
On the face of it, they were immensely successful. The company made profits
of Pounds 1.2m, rising to more than Pounds 5m by 1983. The two men cashed in
Pounds 2m from the share sale to Messrs Jagger and Skipper in 1982, and
retained extremely valuable stakes in the company.
In reality, however, the business was profitable only in so far as it
reported its maximum potential profits without recognising any of its
substantial liabilities.
When Atlantic leased out a computer system, it booked a profit on the
difference between the cost of the system and the sale price to the finance
company that lent the money.
There was no acknowledgement of the liabilities inherent in the Flexlease,
which enabled lessors either to swap the leased computer system for another
after three years (a flex), or to terminate the lease after five years (a
walk), or both.
The report estimates that the company's 'Walk' liabilities amounted to
Pounds 160m by early 1989.
The extent of its problems was not entirely hidden at the time. Competitors
had pointed out the flaws, and a report by Price Waterhouse at the time of
the 1982 buy-out by Mr Skipper and Mr Jagger raised numerous concerns over
the nature of the leases.
One year later, the company was launching a full London flotation valuing it
at Pounds 55.2m. The offer was 1.9 times subscribed.
The prospectus was extremely misleading. The inspectors claim that Mr Davies
and Mr Foulston 'deliberately deceived' the financial advisers as to the
prevalence of 'Walk' options.
They claimed these covered about 5 per cent of Atlantic's leases, when the
actual figure is estimated at between 60 and 90 per cent. The balance sheet
contained no provisions for any of its break-options.
In addition, Atlantic had introduced a critical, but highly questionable,
accounting policy towards these leases.
At the end of the lease period, Atlantic had an option to take the computer
equipment for a nominal sum.
It attached a net present value to that option, based on current estimates,
and not only wrote that value into its balance sheet at the time the lease
was signed, but recognised it as a profit.
The unpredictability of computer resale values should not have surprised
Atlantic, since it had taken a Pounds 966,000 provision against stock
write-downs on obsolete IBM models - this was taken in its 1980 results, and
helped emphasise a trend of rising profits.
The recognising of the residual value on these leasing deals was of
fundamental importance to Atlantic's balance sheet. It accounted for 60 per
cent of 1981 profits and 74 per cent of those in 1982, building an earnings
base on very uncertain foundations.
The nature of Atlantic's potential liabilities, from the Flex and Walk
elements of its leases, put immense pressure on Atlantic to increase sales,
and encouraged by Mr Foulston, sales staff took increasing risks to secure a
deal.
Mr Davies had sold Pounds 3.9m of his shares in the flotation, and he
eventually sold out of the business in May 1986 for a further Pounds 13m.
Mr Foulston became increasingly dominant, but in a more competitive market,
staff were offering deals that were described as suicidal in terms of their
potential liabilities, but which propped up short-term earnings.
However, by 1987, Mr Foulston's interest in motor racing was taking up more
of his time - he owned 70 per cent of Brands Hatch Leisure, which operated
the racing track.
When he died in a motor racing accident in September that year, there was no
management team in place that could replace him. It was only a matter of
time before the inherent flaw in his Flexlease destroyed the company.

John Gunn built British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings into a company worth Pounds
2.5bn in a few furiously busy years in the 1980s. But his purchase of
Atlantic Computers, a deeply flawed company, proved his undoing. B&amp;C crashed
in 1990 with Pounds 1bn in liabilities. Suits and counter-suits against
advisers are seeking some Pounds 3.5bn in compensation
The end came quickly for British &amp; Commonwealth, shortly after it realised
the huge burden it had acquired with Atlantic Computers. But before Mr David
McCormick, Atlantic Computers' chief executive, alerted B&amp;C directors, he
sold shares in the group, the DTI inspectors report.
On April 12 1989, Mr McCormick, telephoned Mr McFadyen, a partner in
accountancy firm Moores Rowland in Jersey.
Mr McCormick, who joined Atlantic in 1986 and was appointed chief executive
after its acquisition by B&amp;C, had built up a holding of 1.2m shares in B&amp;C
through Fundinco, a company controlled by trustees for the benefit of
himself and his family. That afternoon he instructed Mr McFadyen to sell
500,000 shares. The deal, which raised approximately Pounds 1m net, came
after Mr McCormick had become aware of a contingent liability for Atlantic
'far in excess of Pounds 30m to Pounds 40m', say the DTI inspectors.
Information concerning the sale has since been referred to the DTI.
The same week, Mr McCormick told colleagues that Atlantic's liabilities were
substantially higher than the Pounds 30m to Pounds 40m. Mr Nicholas Kennedy
Scott, then a director of Atlantic and B&amp;C, and Mr Adrian Howe, later to
become Mr McCormick's personal assistant, were told that Atlantic's gross
liability was Pounds 160m, none of which had been provided for in Atlantic's
accounts.
The information 'was the first clear disclosure to B&amp;C that Atlantic faced
serious problems', the report says. It marked the beginning of the end for
B&amp;C.
Two years earlier the two senior directors of B&amp;C, Mr John Gunn and Mr Peter
Goldie, had been regarded as successful and experienced in corporate
acquisitions.
During the 1980s, B&amp;C was transformed from a broadly-based industrial group
to a financial services business. It was a transformation achieved on the
back of substantial borrowings when interest rates were relatively low. B&amp;C
was also committed to buying out, over a short period, the interests of the
Cayzer family, former controlling shareholders.
B&amp;C imposed minimal head office control on divisions. This 'hands off'
management philosophy 'may have had its merits', says the report, but 'it
also posed a serious risk for B&amp;C if the business management of any of its
divisions had not been thoroughly researched and understood before
acquisition'.
For B&amp;C the attraction of Atlantic was that it would replace the earnings of
Bricom, which it had sold in 1988. It saw Atlantic as a strong financial
services group with substantial overseas interests, and Atlantic's accounts
indicated that it had strong cash and fast-growing profits.
But the inspectors conclude that B&amp;C completed the deal without having a
clear understanding of the Flexlease, by which Atlantic conducted most of
its leasing business.
'The root cause of Atlantic's failure lay in the lack of commercial
viability of its core product, the Flexlease, and the way in which Atlantic
accounted for profits and failed to make provision for the contingent
liabilities associated with the Flexlease,' the inspectors say.
B&amp;C was told by Atlantic on several occasions that it was not exposed to
residual risks, and never seriously questioned those assurances. The report
primarily blames Mr John Tomkins, Atlantic's chief executive, and Mr Kennedy
Scott for the misrepresentations.
The report also highlights the 'ill-defined' relationship that B&amp;C had with
its external advisers, BZW and Outram, Cullinan &amp; Co, a firm of strategy
consultants. 'B&amp;C appears to have been looking to BZW for advice of a kind
that BZW believed was not within their remit.' The inspectors suggest that
there should have been a detailed letter of engagement between BZW and B&amp;C.
The inspectors also say that BZW should have adopted a more independent and
critical stance in appraising the thoroughness of B&amp;C's enquiries, enabling
them to recognise the shortcomings.
B&amp;C's decision to go ahead with the deal was also influenced by the fact
that Atlantic's published accounts had been given unqualified audit reports
by Spicer &amp; Oppenheim, as well as by a flawed OC&amp;C valuation report of
Atlantic.
The valuation contained 'a serious, but readily detectable, error which was
not noticed by B&amp;C, BZW or OC&amp;C': its definition of operating cash flows.
'It appears to us that the valuation of Atlantic prepared by OC&amp;C had a
material influence on the B&amp;C principal directors' decision to proceed
further with the acquisition negotiations,' the inspectors state.
'In our opinion this financial disaster for B&amp;C and its shareholders would
have been avoided if B&amp;C had adopted a thorough professional approach to its
pre-acquisition enquiries.' B&amp;C acquired Atlantic at the beginning of
September 1988 for about Pounds 408m.
Within seven months, three directors of B&amp;C - Mr Gunn, Mr Goldie and Mr
Rusty Ashman, finance director - had been told of gross liabilities
estimated at Pounds 160m in the UK and US. They first learnt of it,
according to the inspectors, shortly after B&amp;C had issued a preliminary
announcement of its 1988 results, but before signature of either Atlantic's
or B&amp;C's 1988 accounts.
The three men resolved that the 1988 accounts of B&amp;C should not be amended
to provide for Atlantic's liabilities; that Spicer, Atlantic's auditors, and
Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells, B&amp;C's auditors, should not be told; and also that
the matter should not be disclosed to the rest of the B&amp;C board.
As a result, Atlantic's published accounts for 1988 were 'grossly
misleading' and the inspectors conclude that Atlantic 'in all probability
had never made a profit'.
It was not until late July 1989 that the whole B&amp;C board was informed of
Atlantic's contingent liability problem, and it was only after the
appointment of Mr Mark Wood as managing director of Atlantic in March 1990
that 'B&amp;C finally set about a realistic and objective assessment of
Atlantic's business for the first time'. Mr Wood reported that facilities of
up to Pounds 160m were required if Atlantic was to survive. B&amp;C could not
provide such funds.
'The decision was taken, in our view reasonably, to place Atlantic into
administration,' the inspectors state, summing up the response of B&amp;C's
management to the contingent liability problem as 'much too little, much too
late'.
Soon after, on June 3 1990, B&amp;C itself went into administration.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Restless investors ask Signet to reshape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Signet, the jewellery group formerly known as Ratners, yesterday faced calls
for a capital reconstruction from two groups of disaffected shareholders.
The investor groups, both representing preference shareholders, demanded
action to overhaul the share structure and raise fresh capital for the
company.
Pressure for a restructuring has grown since Signet's announcement earlier
this year of annual pre-tax losses of Pounds 85.4m and a sharp increase to
Pounds 58m in preference dividend arrears, which remain unpaid since January
1992.
Mr Julian Treger, an adviser to the UK Active Value Fund - a large holder of
US dollar convertible preference shares - told the company's annual meeting
that dividend arrears could rise to around Pounds 100m this year.
'Whilst this situation persists, the group has no realistic possibility of
access to the capital markets to support the growth of the business and this
makes it increasingly unlikely that ordinary shareholders will see dividends
or real value for a very long time,' he said.
Mr James McAdam, chairman, ruled out an immediate reconstruction, saying the
demands were inappropriate. 'First we must get a positive earnings stream.
We have considered a restructuring but we don't think the time is right. We
must have a cake before we start cutting it up.'
Mr Treger, the South African corporate financier who helped rescue Greycoat
from receivership, said he would consider supporting proposals by US
shareholders for an extraordinary meeting. Plans for an EGM have been drawn
up by Delta Dividend Group, based in San Francisco, which wants Signet's
variable term preference shares listed on Nasdaq and its share capital
restructured within a year.
Signet's annual meeting also heard an allegation from Mr Brian Smith, former
general manager at the Colindale warehouse in London, that there was a
Pounds 500,000 stock theft in 1992. The company admitted there had been a
higher than average stock loss, which had been investigated. It said
although there was 'suspicion of theft', nothing had been proved.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Black reveals anger at Cazenove withdrawal: Telegraph
chairman tells Raymond Snoddy that the stockbroker's rebuff after share
controversy 'did the maximum possible damage to our reputation'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is more than three weeks since Mr Conrad Black's Telegraph group suffered
an enormous blow to its pride when Cazenove resigned as stockbroker to the
company.
Talking for the first time about Cazenove's action it is clear that Mr
Black's anger at being publicly rebuffed by one of London's most respected
brokers is growing . They gave us less than two hours' notice that they were
withdrawing from the account,' says Mr Black, surrounded by pictures of
warships in his quiet office in Canary Wharf Tower.
'They left and they did the maximum possible damage to our reputation as a
company,' he added. There does, however, appear to be considerable support
among City institutions for Cazenove's action.
Cazenove withdrew as Telegraph's broker in the wake of controversy in the
City over the group. On May 19 institutions bought 12.5m Telegraph shares at
587p a share but just over a month later when Mr Black cut the cover price
of The Daily Telegraph in response to Mr Rupert Murdoch's cut-price Times,
the group's share price dropped by 191p to 349p. A Stock Exchange
investigation quickly cleared the Telegraph of wrongdoing.
Mr Black claims that Cazenove were told in May that he was not pleased with
its performance in the original share sale and it was made clear before the
price cut row that 'perhaps an orderly, amicable parting of the ways in the
course of the summer would be in order'.
The Telegraph chairman said that on Wednesday June 22 a senior official of
Cazenove, Mr David Wentworth-Stanley, was given a full briefing on the
planned cover price cut. Cazenove, according to Mr Black, said there would
be controversy but 'they absolutely assured us that they would not find it
particularly embarrassing and it would not particularly discomfort them'.
After the cover price cut and the share drop Mr David Mayhew, 'an
exceedingly senior Cazenove official', told Mr Black the price cut had
embarrassed the house and its clients but added, according to Mr Black, that
Cazenove 'will not do anything provocative and we will not withdraw
abruptly'. Mr Black was therefore shocked to be given what he said was two
hours' notice of the withdrawal. He said an agreed statement was issued
saying it was a mutual arrangement.
'We were basically moving them out anyway but not that day for obvious
reasons. Then an unnamed Cazenove official was quoted in the Financial Times
bannered across the front page saying that they had never in living memory
withdrawn from an account like this.'
'This famous firm just scuttled out the back door into the tall grass. That
is just not the behaviour one would expect of Cazenove,' said Mr Black.
Before leaving for a Mediterranean sailing holiday, Mr Black said: 'I feel
outraged at their (Cazenove's) performance but I think in the end these
things have their natural consequences.'
He added: 'I think Cazenove will pay a heavy price for having deserted a
reputable client in a damaging way when in fact that client committed no
impropriety and has been absolved by every relevant and interested party
including Cazenove itself.'

FT  22 JUL 94 / IBM bounces back to quarterly Dollars 689m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines yesterday surprised Wall Street with higher
than expected second quarter earnings as expenses were sharply reduced.
It said demand for mainframe computers was strong, but it still faced
serious problem in its personal computer operations. A raised target for
cost reductions could result in further job losses.
Second quarter earnings of Dollars 689m (Pounds 440m), or Dollars 1.14 per
share, were well above analysts estimates' of 45-80 cents per share. For the
same period last year, IBM reported a loss of Dollars 40m, or 8 cents per
share, before restructuring charges that brought net losses to Dollars 8bn
or Dollars 14.10 per share.
Mr Lou Gerstner, chairman and chief executive, said: 'We are still far from
where we need to be, but we are showing steady improvement'. IBM's share
price gained Dollars 5 1/8 to Dollars 61 by midday in New York.
Revenues for the quarter were Dollars 15.4bn, an increase of 3 per cent.
Computer hardware sales rose 3 per cent, but software revenue was flat. The
US and Europe were static at Dollars 5.9bn and Dollars 5.5bn respectively,
while sales in the Asia Pacific region picked up 14 per cent to Dollars
2.8bn.
Total expenses declined by 18 per cent and 8,000 jobs were eliminated.
Research and development spending was reduced by almost 21 per cent to
Dollars 1.1bn.
Last year, IBM said it intended to cut expenses by Dollars 7bn from 1992
levels, by 1996. To date they are down Dollars 4.8bn. Mr Jerry York, chief
financial officer, said IBM had increased the goal for cuts to Dollars 8bn.
It still plans to reduce its workforce by a further 20,000 this year to
215,000 and more job cuts now appear likely in 1995.
In IBM's traditional mainframe computer business, demand exceeded supply.
'We are sold out on mainframes well into the fourth quarter,' said Mr York.
Revenues continued to decline as a result of price cuts, but the rate of
decline had slowed.
IBM's Dollars 13bn PC business, however, is facing serious problems.
Revenues declined in the US, Mr York said, although there was 'decent growth
in overseas markets' and overall revenue growth was about 5 per cent.
Mr York said IBM would consolidate its PC operations, simplify product
design and product lines and take steps to resolve inventory and logistics
problems.
In the computer services sector, targeted for growth, revenues increased 24
per cent.
For the half year, IBM reported net earnings of Dollars 1bn, or Dollars 1.68
a share. This compares with a net loss of Dollars 372m, or 66 cents, in the
first half of last year, excluding restructuring charges. Revenue for the
six months was Dollars 28.7bn, up 4 per cent. Lex, Page 16

FT  22 JUL 94 / Wellcome forecasts further double-digit growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wellcome, the UK pharmaceuticals group, yesterday reported a 12 per cent
advance in pre-tax profits to Pounds 182m for the four months to June 30.
Sales increased 13 per cent from Pounds 610m to Pounds 690m, but were
flattered by the inclusion for the first time of revenues from the Warner
Wellcome Consumer Healthcare joint venture. Underlying sales growth of
prescription products was 7 per cent, reaching Pounds 558m.
Mr John Robb, chairman and chief executive, said margins had been maintained
and he expected double-digit growth to continue this year. Margins would
remain in the 28 to 32 per cent range.
Wellcome surprised analysts with a larger than expected Pounds 52m
exceptional charge to restructure its consumer operations. Mr Robb said
there would be no further exceptional items related to the Warner Wellcome
venture. The shares fell 10p to 605p.
Zovirax, the anti-herpes compound and Wellcome's top-selling drug, generated
sales of Pounds 270m, up 17 per cent. US sales increased 27 per cent to
Pounds 106m, which Mr Robb described as a tremendous achievement. Only 3
percentage points of growth had been achieved through price increases.
Zovirax sales in Europe were up 9 per cent at Pounds 90m, but suffered price
cuts equivalent to three percentage points. Japanese sales were up only 4
per cent at Pounds 55m, because of doctors' fears of prescribing anti-viral
medicines after a competitor's product killed a number of patients. Sales
there were now recovering, said Mr Robb.
Sales of Retrovir, the HIV and Aids treatment also known as AZT, fell 15 per
cent to Pounds 62m. The drug is still struggling with the Anglo-French
Concorde trial published last year which questioned its effectiveness in
patients who were HIV-positive but without symptoms.
Mr Robb said he was not overly concerned about the US Food and Drug
Administration advisory committee's delay in considering Zovirax as a
non-prescription drug.
Earnings per share rose 11 per cent to 12.7p. The second interim dividend
per share was 5.8p.
The company was reporting second interim results as it is changing its
financial year-end from August to December.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Pensions unease may have cost Prudential sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK sales of premium life and pensions policies by Prudential Corporation,
the UK's largest life insurer, fell by almost one-fifth in the first six
months of this year compared with the same period of 1993.
This contrasted with some sharp increases in sales in Australia and other,
much smaller, Asia Pacific operations, and a recently improving position for
Jackson National Life, the group's US subsidiary.
Prudential's first-half new business figures, published yesterday, showed a
fall of 20 per cent in UK sales of single premium life and pension products
to Pounds 1.12bn and a drop in annual premium sales of life and pensions
products of 18 per cent to Pounds 126m.
Sales of personal pensions to people transferring out of an occupational
scheme fell by one-quarter, from Pounds 165m in the first half of 1993 to
Pounds 123m in the first six months of this year.
Caution on the part of both customers and life companies in the pensions
transfer business, following widespread concern about standards of selling,
was reflected in figures released by the Association of British Insurers.
These showed that sales of single premium personal pensions dropped sharply
across the industry in the first quarter of the year.
But there was better news in the UK investment business, with sales of
regular premium unit trusts and Pep business rising to Pounds 64m from
Pounds 12m - more than offsetting the drop in sales of single premium
products to Pounds 99m from Pounds 110m.
'In contrast to the first half of 1993, 1994 has - so far - proved to be a
difficult time for the UK insurance market,' Mr Mick Newmarch, group chief
executive, said. 'However, the market for investment products is currently
proving to be much more buoyant.'
This is the first time Prudential has reported sales of investment products
along with sales of life and pension policies.
Mr Newmarch said that Prudential had begun updating and enhancing its range
of products to position it for the introduction of the new rules for
disclosing information to customers.
Single contribution sales at Jackson National Life were, at Dollars 844m
(Pounds 544.5m), down on the first half of 1993, but higher than the second
half of last year.
Impending tax changes in Australia helped Prudential almost to double single
premium insurance sales to ADollars 886m (Pounds 421.9m), though annual
premium product sales were flat at ADollars 32m.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Record UK exports outside EU underline recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Record trade figures and strong car production data provided further
evidence yesterday that the UK economic recovery is spreading throughout the
industrial sector.
The Central Statistical Office said exports to countries outside the
European Union rose to record levels in the second quarter of this year, as
UK companies benefited from rising demand in the US and other economies.
Exports to non-EU countries - which represent almost half of all UK trade -
rose to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 15.57bn in the three months to June 30,
1.5 per cent higher than in the first quarter, and 10 per cent above the
same period of 1993.
Imports, by contrast, fell 1 per cent in the second quarter, from the first
quarter, resulting in a steady reduction in Britain's trade deficit with
non-EU countries to Pounds 495m in June, and Pounds 1.66bn in the second
quarter of the year.
The trade deficit figures were better than the City had expected, and
analysts said they showed Britain's recovery was expanding without yet
sucking in large quantities of imports.
The Treasury said it was 'encouraged' by the reduction in the trade deficit
and by strong car production data.
Motor industry statistics released yesterday show UK car production this
year may reach its highest level for 21 years thanks to an unexpectedly
strong market recovery in the UK and clear signs that continental Europe's
steepest sales slump for decades has ended.
The statistics, released jointly by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders and the CSO, show that total car output rose last month to 145,078,
nearly 8 per cent above the figure for June 1993.
Increasing economic activity in the UK is also reflected in a sharp rise in
commercial vehicle output. This leapt by 27.2 per cent, on a year-on-year
basis, to 21,328.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Tietmeyer fuels hope of German rate fall: Bundesbank
president optimistic on inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, yesterday reinforced
expectations that German interest rates could fall again in the autumn by
saying that growth in money supply was lower than unadjusted figures suggest
and that inflation was heading in the right direction.
Mr Tietmeyer, speaking after a mid-year review of the bank's M3 measure of
money supply, indicated that the German central bank was relying less than
usual for policy guidance on its volatile M3 indicator. The distinction
between money which could potentially fuel inflation (the normal M3
constituents) and funds invested for the long-term had become less clear, he
said.
But the Bundesbank would not give up M3, he stressed. It was a part of
Germany's 'stability culture'. Experience showed the link between the
measure and future inflation to be intact, while yesterday's review of
alternatives had shown them to be 'second-best solutions', he said.
A review of possible modifications to presentation and interpretation would
continue until December when the 1995 M3 growth target was due to be fixed.
Meanwhile, trends in public spending policy, wage agreements and near-term
inflation were important factors guiding policy, he suggested.
'As long as other sources make us confident that future price developments
are moving in the right direction, deviations from the M3 target path can to
some extent be tolerated,' he said.
The consumer price index, currently rising at 3 per cent, was on the right
track, and there were signs of further flattening, he said. Recent increases
in raw materials prices were being countered by the relative strength of the
D-Mark against the US dollar, he added. Although a statement from the bank
warned that lingering excess liquidity in the M3 figure would cause concern,
Mr Tietmeyer claimed the measure had been growing at an 'adjusted' annual
rate of around 6 per cent for the last three months.
This is close to the bank's target range of 4-6 per cent, which has been
exceeded so far this year. The unadjusted M3 growth rate for June, released
earlier this week, was 11.3 per cent.
The bank's decision yesterday to fix the interest rate for securities
repurchase agreements at 4.85 per cent for the four weeks of the summer
break was not a signal to other countries, Mr Tietmeyer said.
Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, vice-president, said the fixed 'repo' rate was in
line with market rates and expectations.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Italian coalition in disarray as talks on economy falter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes that the Berlusconi government would reach a quick comprehensive
agreement on economic policy collapsed last night over serious differences
on spending cuts and how to raise funds to hold down the budget deficit.
The major casualty was the much-promised shake-up in the costly state
pensions scheme proposed by the Treasury and designed to save at least
L8,000bn (Pounds 3.3bn) next year. After serious reservations from Mr
Clemente Mastella, the labour minister, and threats of a major confrontation
from the unions, the cabinet indicated it was willing to let the matter rest
until September.
Failure to agree on pension cuts was accompanied by a row among the main
partners in the rightwing coalition over the introduction of a pardon for
people who have constructed buildings built without proper permission and
without paying the appropriate fees.
As tensions between partners in the government coalition grew, a fist-fight
broke out in the chamber of deputies between a League deputy and a deputy
from Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia. They had earlier indulged in a
slanging match over the way each party had behaved in the withdrawal of the
decree on preventive detention.
Because of the differences the government is now likely to do little more
than repeat the already announced broad economic targets for the 1995 budget
without fully explaining how the money will be found to bridge the budget
deficit.
Mr Lamberto Dini, the treasury minister, last week said the deficit would be
held down to L140,000bn, or equivalent to just below 9 per cent of GDP. This
will be done by finding some L30,000bn in spending cuts and L15,000bn in new
revenues. The key areas identified for spending cuts were pensions and
health.
The main new revenues will be an amnesty on a backlog of 3.2m disputed tax
assessment cases and the pardon on illicit building. Both items will come
into effect this year and will cover the L5,000bn shortfall in the 1994
budget revenue projections.
The postponement of any serious discussion on pensions is likely to be
viewed negatively by the financial markets. Pension cuts are widely seen as
the test of the Berlusconi government's resolve to take unpopular measures
to restore Italy's public finances to the criteria laid down by the
Maastricht treaty.
Yesterday Mr Mastella, who is also responsible for pensions, was reported to
have said the maximum realistic sum to be raised from changes in pensions
was L4,000bn.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If Cazenove thought its resignation as Mr Conrad Black's broker would put an
end to its embarrassment over its role in placing a large slug of the media
magnate's Telegraph shares, it was mistaken. Mr Black's reputation was badly
damaged by the defection. His extraordinary broadside in an interview with
the FT seems designed to knock Cazenove's reputation in return.
It is unlikely that investors who bought the shares will have much truck
with Mr Black's arguments. The Telegraph's decision to join the newspaper
price war shortly after the share placement left them nursing huge losses.
Cazenove's resignation was a damage limitation exercise apparently designed
to placate investors' wrath and so protect its valuable share placing
franchise.
The danger for Cazenove is that Mr Black's accusation that the broker
'scurried out of the back door into the tall grass' could unsettle its other
customer base - corporate clients. If Mr Black's interpretation of events is
accurate, Cazenove was not too fussed when first told that the Telegraph
planned to slash its cover price. It was only after it experienced the full
force of the City's revulsion at what had happened that it resigned
abruptly. Cazenove may, of course, have full answers to these criticisms.
But so long as it maintains its famed policy of not commenting about its
business, doubts will remain.

FT  22 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Bundesbank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank still managed a small surprise yesterday even if its failure
to cut the discount rate or amend its money supply target were widely
expected. The slightly unsettling aspect of its council meeting was the
decision to fix the money market repurchase rate at 4.85 per cent until
after the summer holiday recess. That is only three basis points below the
present level and is a clear indication of the central bank's caution on
rate cuts.
Admittedly the bank could not afford to continue cutting the repurchase rate
by three or four basis points a week without using up nearly all its leeway
during the holiday period. Speculation about a discount rate cut as soon as
the recess was over would then grow unbearable. From that perspective,
fixing the repurchase rate makes technical sense. But there is no escaping
the conclusion that the Bundesbank wants to avoid being bounced into a
discount rate cut as soon as the recess is over. It would prefer to wait for
more evidence of falling inflation and money supply growth. That is natural,
as the bank has to watch for the impact on the bond market of any decisions
it makes on interest rates. But the message of indifference to the dollar's
fate could hardly be more explicit. That the dollar actually rose yesterday
was thus baffling. In contrast to Wednesday, it was helped by supportive
comments on the other side of the Atlantic from Mr Alan Greenspan of the
Federal Reserve and Mr Larry Summers of the US Treasury. But while the
central banks dither on interest rates, the currency still looks vulnerable.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Everybody knew that IBM was massively overweight. But few expected that the
computer giant could cut its fat quite as quickly as it has. For the second
time in a row, quarterly profits have outpaced investor expectations.
Earnings per share in the three-months to end-June at Dollars 1.14 were 60
per cent higher than consensus forecasts. Mr Louis Gerstner, who took over
as Big Blue's chairman and chief executive last year, had more good news on
cost-cutting yesterday. The group's original 1992 target of lopping off
Dollars 7bn of costs by 1996 has been raised to Dollars 8bn.
While the stringent diet is both necessary and welcome, it is the relatively
easy part of IBM's strategy to return to health. The more difficult part
will be to change the group's culture so it becomes faster-thinking and
faster-moving. Otherwise, its market share will continue to be gobbled up by
more dynamic rivals such as Compaq. Yesterday's results provide little
evidence that it is winning this battle. The rate of decline in revenues
from mainframes, its traditional stronghold, did slow. But it was still a
decline.
Performance in the faster-growing personal computer market was
disappointing. Sales in the US were flat, with the only growth coming from
international markets. Compaq, by contrast, reported a 53 per cent jump in
second-quarter sales earlier this week. Unless Mr Gerstner can find new
sources of revenue, the only option will be to keep hacking away at IBM's
costs. Big Blue may then be profitable but terribly shrunken.

FT  22 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Wellcome's cool reception
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wellcome might have hoped that its results would be better received if it
produced more of them. Unfortunately, its second set of interim results only
confused the market. Some impressive sales figures for Zovirax were
overshadowed by the accounting complexities and Pounds 52m of exceptional
reorganisation costs. Wellcome's shares again retreated on the familiar
litany of worries about the expiry of Zovirax's patent; the growing threat
of the rival drug, Famvir; and the lack of a strong drugs pipeline to
maintain the sales momentum.
None of these concerns can be quickly dispelled. But perhaps the more
important issue confronting Wellcome will be how successfully it can develop
an OTC version of Zovirax. The tie-up with Warner-Lambert gives Wellcome the
wherewithal to do the job. But it is still too early to tell for sure. In
the meantime, Wellcome's shares will be kept warm by their yield. Wellcome's
Pounds 600m cash pile and its commitment to run down dividend cover from 2.7
times also hold an appeal. If Wellcome eventually fails to build a strong
OTC Zovirax franchise or is not lucky in developing newer products, then the
logic for merger will grow inescapable. There may be some sense in deepening
the association with Warner-Lambert. But it would be extraordinary if other
cash-rich drugs groups did not cast an envious eye over Wellcome given its
grip on the anti-viral field. That suggests there may be greater long term
value in Wellcome than the market is currently prepared to recognise. How
quickly that potential can be released - and who will do so - will remain
unclear for some time to come.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Serb conundrum
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The fate of the latest peace plan for Bosnia is unfolding in a predictable
way. Neither side likes it, but the Bosnian government accepted it in order
to avoid being blamed for its failure. The Bosnian Serbs have not accepted
it, but have played for time by demanding clarifications, in a manner
reminiscent of the IRA.
The authors of the plan - Britain, France, Germany, Russia and the US - are
agreed in finding the Serb response unsatisfactory, but not on how to react
to it. The US, backed on this point by the EU mediator, Lord Owen, is urging
the contact group to stand firm and penalise the Serbs as the recalcitrant
party. The Russians, backed by the UN mediator Thorvald Stoltenberg, believe
that peace depends on finding answers to at least some of the questions the
Serbs have raised.
No doubt there will be talks on these issues, formally or informally,
between now and July 30 when the contact group is due to meet at foreign
minister level. But the US is surely right to warn against falling for the
Serb tactic. Once again the 'international community' has a credibility
problem, which will only be made worse if, because of its internal
divisions, it allows yet another deadline to be ignored with impunity.
Part of the trouble is that the Bosnian Serbs are shielded by two levels of
intermediaries. First there is Serbia itself, in the person of President
Milosevic. Although he carries a heavier weight of responsibility than any
other single person for the whole Yugoslav tragedy, many people involved in
the diplomatic process, including notably Lord Owen, have convinced
themselves that he is now genuinely anxious for peace and able to bring the
Bosnian Serbs to heel if only he is given time and treated with respect.
This dubious proposition should not be taken on trust. If Serbia wants to
escape feeling the world's displeasure itself, it must either deliver the
Bosnian Serbs' assent to the proposed settlement or co-operate in visiting
the world's displeasure on them.
The second level is the Russians, whom many western leaders are anxious to
'keep on board' because of their supposed influence over the Serbs. Much the
same reasoning applies to them: if they cannot demonstrate their influence
by delivering Serb assent to the peace plan they have themselves helped draw
up, their objections to measures aimed at coercing Serbia into a more
co-operative attitude should be brushed aside.
Among those measures, lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia has become 'a last
resort' even for the US defence secretary. A more credible deterrent against
Serbia must be the threat to confine it indefinitely to the fringe of the
world community and the world economy, so long as it supports the forcible
exclusion of the Bosnian majority from their homes. Serbia may not be
defeated militarily, but it can be quarantined.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Personal View: The great transition robbery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By OLEH HAVRYLYSHYN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Of more than 30 countries in the Soviet-socialist bloc, few have made a good
start on stabilisation and transition to the market. Only eight - Poland,
the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and the
surprise-case, Albania - have controlled inflation, stabilised their
currencies, liberalised prices and international trade, and privatised the
bulk of small retail and service outlets. Most of them are also seeing a
turnround from negative to positive economic growth.
So why have the others not done the same? The simple answer is that powerful
elites do not want reform. As central command disappeared, the old Soviet
'patriarchs' - directors of enterprises and state farms, and local political
bosses - gained autonomy. At first, the expected reform measures -
privatisation, opening up of markets to foreign competition and diminution
of subsidies - threatened their status. Where reform measures were
undertaken quickly, those members of the elite who survived were forced to
behave roughly like competitive capitalists. Elsewhere, delays in proceeding
with reforms gave them time to transform themselves into
monopolist-capitalists.
Under the in-between economic arrangements, the state provides subsidies and
cheap credits, allegedly to keep the economy going and people on the job.
This not only causes inflation. It also provides the directorate with
influence and with funds to engage in side operations, such as purchasing
titanium, magnesium or petroleum cheaply, obtaining licences from their old
colleagues, and then selling the commodities abroad at a tidy profit. This
causes materials shortages, corruption, capital flight, an inflow of
Mercedes-Benz cars and popular discontent.
The patriarchs partially assuage discontent by ensuring workers have jobs
and receive enough to survive. Nevertheless, the discontent finds an outlet,
with workers saying: 'You pretend to be paying us less even than in Soviet
times; and we pretend even less to be working.' The result is more
absenteeism, less effort and even less production. More worrisome,
investment in production capacity is not taking place, since commercial
operations are far more profitable.
Having been given the time to recover from the shock of communism's
overthrow, the old-new elites now find it in their interest to go neither
back to state command, nor forward to competitive markets. From a
socialist-patriarchal society, where the elite's promise was 'you have
entitlements, while we have privileges', the lagging countries have moved to
a rentier-patriarchal society, where the elite says 'you are still assured
of minimal entitlements, while we profit maximally from the new
opportunities'.
The frequent characterisations of the result as a corrupt society, with a
few wealthy robber-barons, express the moral indignation of the people. But
beyond moral judgments, a far more important conclusion emerges: the new
rentier-patriarchal elites are, in general, opposed to further reform. They
are unlikely to look kindly upon measures to break up monopolies, raise
rates of interest, curtail easy credits, or liberalise prices and trade, all
of which would undermine their privileged position.
Popular opposition to further reform is increased by two contradictory
perceptions. Since the elites share a small part of their gains with
workers, the latter support them in lobbying for preferential treatment. At
the same time, the monopolistic capitalism people observe and abhor is
mistaken for the competitive capitalism advocated by reformers.
Consequently, popular resentment is directed against market reforms.
Economies do not disintegrate overnight, so this limbo can continue for a
long time. Might the elites realise they are killing the goose that lays
golden eggs and so support reform? There is a chance, but only for partial
reform.
At some point, they will recognise that excessive cheap credit and subsidies
cause inflation, which hurts even the new capitalists in the long run, since
it eats away at the production potential of the economy. Soon - in some
cases already - privatisation, even of large-scale enterprises, will also be
in the interest of the new capitalists, since they can become large
shareholders.
If competition were allowed to sort out the efficient capitalists from the
inept, this would help the economy. But this is a big 'if'. The elites may
see stabilisation and privatisation as in their interest, but are unlikely
to consider liberalisation in the same way, since it would threaten their
cosy monopolies.
The best-case scenario is one of an economy that is privatised, monopolised
and highly regulated by government. As in many Latin American and African
examples, what is likely is not successful stabilisation, but a series of
failed attempts. It is natural to hope for something better. But wherever
the opportunity to move forward quickly has been lost, the reality may be
that the transition is frozen.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Slender thread in Strasbourg
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Santer, narrowly confirmed yesterday as the next president of the
Brussels Commission, has been trying to muster support from a wide variety
of quarters. Last week he declared his attachment to decentralised
decision-making and EU enlargement. This week, speaking to the European
parliament before yesterday's vote, he emphasised his backing for economic
and monetary union and EU social policy.
Since he was nobody's first choice, it is not surprising that Mr Santer's
espousal of well-meaning Euro-orthodoxies failed to fire parliament's
full-hearted enthusiasm. After the mismanagement of the succession to Mr
Jacques Delors, governments should now be in no doubt of the flaws in the
method of selecting the person who represents Europe within the continent
and on a wider stage. When Mr Santer's successor is chosen, presumably in
1999, it must be through an open rather than a closed elective process.
By upholding Mr Santer's appointment, yesterday's vote has none the less
rescued European leaders' credibility. This will have been a particular
relief to Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The chief champion both of Mr Santer and
of giving the parliament more influence, Mr Kohl could have been badly
damaged had the cup used to anoint Strasbourg with power been flung back in
his face.
Yet the narrow margin also emphasises the slender thread on which the EU's
constitutional arrangements are hung. Having won 'co-decision' rights with
the Council of Ministers, the parliament has much more say over European
legislation. It is still only at the beginning of learning how to deploy
this extra clout. In view of increased parliamentary fragmentation after
last month's elections, its difficulties in acting predictably and
cohesively should not be underestimated.
The assembly has still a long way to go in making itself less remote from
and more accountable to European electorates. These aims will not be served
if it gives further evidence of the sort of debatable judgment already
displayed in its veto on Tuesday of telecommunications liberalisation. More
clashes with governments may be in store, for instance in the budgetary
field, where many MEPs' desire for more spending to combat unemployment may
collide with finance ministries' attempts to cut fiscal deficits. Unless
MEPs reserve their displays of muscle for issues of genuine merit,
parliament could become its own worst enemy.
A test of Strasbourg's mettle centres on the preparations for the 1996
conference to review the Maastricht treaty. Since no government at present
wants to take a high-profile role here, parliament has an ideal opportunity
to map out an agenda that would take account of electorates' scepticism
about some Maastricht aims, yet would also allow the EU to become both wider
and more integrated. Taking the lead in the 1996 debate would be the best
way for parliament to play a constructive part in shaping Europe's future.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hard to believe that the financial collapse of Atlantic Computers  -
which also caused the demise of its parent, British &amp; Commonwealth - was
only four years ago. The story, so trenchantly retold yesterday in a DTI
report, belongs to a distant age.
The chief protagonists in the Atlantic/B&amp;C tale are the late John Foulston,
the founder of the computer company who died in a motor-racing accident, and
John Gunn, who for a while transformed B&amp;C into a seemingly dynamic
financial services group.
Mr Foulston and his successors constructed an elaborate house of cards out
of Atlantic, which was founded in 1975, came to the stock market in 1983
with a value of Pounds 40m and was eventually sold to B&amp;C in 1988 for Pounds
408m.
Throughout its history, questions had been raised about whether Atlantic's
profits were being inflated by inappropriate accounting policies. Yet it was
not until 1990 that the truth emerged, when it collapsed with a deficiency
in excess of Pounds 90m.
As the DTI inspectors say, if the group had used prudent accounting
policies, it would probably never have been able to report a profit
throughout its existence. Yet between 1983 and 1988, it reported aggregate
pre - tax profits of Pounds 127.6m.
This deception was made possible in part because of the inadequacies of
accounting rules, many of which have since been reformed. However the
inspectors believe a more important factor lay with the City firms, in
particular Spicer and Pegler, Atlantic's auditor, which too readily placed
confidence in half truths provided by Atlantic directors about potential
leasing losses.
B&amp;C's directors, notably Mr Gunn, the chairman, and Peter Goldie, the chief
executive, are also blamed for acquiring Atlantic without having a
sufficiently deep understanding of it. After the deal went through, Mr Gunn,
Mr Goldie and the finance director, Mr Rusty Ashman, quickly learned about
Atlantic's appalling financial condition, but then prevaricated for months
before disclosing the disaster to outside shareholders. Though the
inspectors say that they did not act dishonestly or seek to defraud anyone,
the DTI is probably right to seek their disqualification as directors.
Though the market conditions which allowed Atlantic to prosper are long
passed, the report uncovers one area of City of London practice which needs
urgent reform. BZW, which was B&amp;C's merchant bank adviser, allowed its name
to be used to endorse the wisdom of the Atlantic takeover in B&amp;C's letter to
shareholders about it. Shareholders take comfort when such assurances are
given by a merchant bank, yet the level of investigation which a merchant
bank carries out when giving such an endorsement is minimal. BZW did not
even carry out the normal minimum - but the inspectors suggest that even if
it had, it might not have uncovered the truth about Atlantic.

The Kafkaesque problems besetting Russia's ailing enterprises have taken a
new twist. Normally, energy suppliers are the main victims of non-payments.
But one of the country's biggest oil producers had its electricity cut off
on Wednesday - for not paying bills of Rbs150bn.
The Siberian oil giant, Nizhnevartovskneftegas, says 900 of its oil wells
have stopped production after the electricity authorities cut it off. A
special oil and fuel ministry commission is now heading east from Moscow to
settle the dispute.
Nizhnevartovskneftegas reckons it in turn is owed more than Rbs300bn - some
Dollars 150m - for unpaid oil bills.
What was that about paying pipers and calling tunes?

<TEXT>
Jacques Chirac is no stranger to the front covers of French magazines; as
former prime minister, present mayor of Paris and prospective presidential
candidate, he graces them continually. But it's strange to see him
apparently fare-dodging - by vaulting over a Metro turnstile on the front
cover of this week's Le Nouvel Observateur. The headline? 'The France that
Cheats'.
Chirac is not named on the cover or the accompanying story, which argues
that tax evasion, fare dodging and other fiddles are now commonplace in
France. But it's him all right.
His office says it was taken 'in good humour' 18 years ago during a Metro
equipment breakdown, when a younger Chirac leap-frogged over a ticket
turnstile.
Chirac doesn't see the joke. He has accused Le Nouvel Observateur of
'serious violation of press ethics' - and is suing.

One of the main planks of the Brazilian government current economic reform

So what will Central Intelligence Agency director James Woolsey be wearing
today? Fridays at the CIA are now 'dressing-down' days. Not more
recriminations over the Aldrich Ames spy debacle, but an experiment in
casual dressing.
It's the latest effort by Woolsey to alter CIA culture from that of a
closed, white male fraternity, into something a little more, well, casual.
Supporters of this trend, now creeping across US life, claim it enhances
team spirit and productivity. Others suggest that since most people slack on
Fridays anyway, they may as well look the part.
Woolsey says the spooks may wear red suits or stand on their head for all he
cares - just so long as they do a good job.
But even though a renowned demon on the ballroom floor, Woolsey is unlikely
to turn up today in his patent-leather dancing pumps. Too slippery by far .

FT  22 JUL 94 / No longer as safe as houses: The repercussions of losses
made in the US market for securities based on home loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Take a Dollars 1,500bn financial market, a handful of ambitious investment
banks, and a group of incautious investors willing to risk their (or someone
else's) money. Add the latest high-tec wizardry Wall Street has to offer.
Then sit back and wait for external events to take their course - an
unexpected rise in interest rates, for instance. Suddenly, you have the
ingredients for a market upheaval, 1990s style.
The US's market in mortgage-backed securities, by which many home loans are
financed, has provided just such a spectacle in recent months. The latest
victim, UK drugs company Glaxo, indicated last week that it had lost about
Pounds 100m from investments in this and other risky markets. It joins a
long list of others which have suffered significant losses on the market -
from US investment fund Askin Capital (which has lost a large part of its
Dollars 600m capital and been forced to file for bankruptcy) to a US
subsidiary of Bank of Montreal (whose losses reached Dollars 51m), and
Kidder Peabody, the investment bank owned by General Electric.
The debacle not only raises questions about risk assessment on Wall Street
but threatens to spill over from the financial into the real world. The
impact of the upheavals in the mortgage-backed securities market on other
bond markets may have slowed US economic growth by forcing up long-term
interest rates, though the precise effects are incalculable. As Wall
Street's fingers have been burnt, families in the US have found it more
expensive to buy their first homes. Some investors in US mutual funds
(similar to UK unit trusts) - which have played the market will have lost a
small amount of their capital.
The damage mortgage-backed securities has caused seems strange given their
seemingly humble purpose of providing money for people to buy homes. Rather
than the cash coming directly from a financial institution such as a bank,
it is provided by investors who buy bonds. Mortgage payments by home owners
cover the interest and principal payments on the bonds. By pooling thousands
of such domestic mortgages, Wall Street has created a multi-billion-dollar
market which is now reckoned to account for more than Dollars 1,500bn, or
about half of all home loans in the US.
Problems have arisen because the evolution of these products has not stopped
there. Since the late 1980s, the mortgage-backed bond market has been
subjected to the sort of financial engineering which has made a new
generation of Wall Street traders rich. The theory behind the re-engineering
was simple: why not mould the bonds into instruments which would match the
needs of particular groups of investors more closely?
This task was achieved with the help of technology developed in the market
for derivatives - complex financial instruments whose value is based in part
on that of an underlying market. Bonds were pooled and their interest and
principal cashflows divided to create new, more exotic financial products.
After the most attractive parts of the bonds have been made into new
instruments, the remainder - known as 'toxic waste' - is sold cheaply to
risk-hungry investors, retained by the investment bank, or perhaps thrown
together with odds and ends left over from other pools of mortgages to
create more new instruments (some known as 'kitchen sink bonds', since a bit
of everything has been thrown in).
All these reconfigured mortgage-backed bonds go under the name of
collateralised mortgage obligations (CMOs). By some estimates, as much as a
half of all mortgage-backed bonds have been converted into CMOs. Because
they are sometimes heavily geared, their price can move sharply with changes
in interest rates, giving investors more bang for their bucks.
If that was the end of the story, there would be little to distinguish
mortgage-backed securities from other fixed income instruments. But the
market has a unique feature: when interest rates fall, home owners may pay
off their loans and take out a new loan at a lower interest rate. When rates
are high, they probably won't pay them off at all.
A failure, by those who design and invest in the products, to predict what
homeowners would do in the unusual financial market conditions since last
summer has wreaked havoc.
The problems began at the peak of last year's bond market rally. Against
most expectations, long-term US bond yields fell to historic lows, as
investors grew confident that inflation (the bond-buyer's worst enemy) was
no longer a threat. Mortgage rates fell with them. That unleashed a wave of
mortgage-refinancing by home owners on an unparalleled scale.
The complex computer programmes used to construct and value CMOs did not
predict that people would behave in this way. By paying off their old loans
at such a rapid rate, homeowners played havoc with bond prices. CMOs took
the brunt of the pain: 'Interest only', or IO, bonds (created out of the
interest payments from mortgage-backed securities) fell furthest, as
investors lost their expected future interest payments. The shock waves were
felt from the bond-trading floor at securities house Salomon Brothers all
the way to a string of small municipal authorities in Ohio, which had bought
IOs.
This spring, it was the opposite story in the mortgage-backed bond market.
As US bond yields rose along with short-term interest rates (in turn pushing
up mortgage rates) homeowners stopped paying off their old loans. The
Mortgage Bankers Association estimates that the value of mortgages
refinanced, which reached Dollars 550bn in 1993, will fall to just Dollars
150bn this year.
With the level of refinancing lower than expected, investors have suddenly
found that bonds which had an expected life of, say, two years, are unlikely
to be repaid until much later. The average duration of bonds in Salomon's
mortgage-backed bond index has jumped from 3.2 years at the beginning of
February to more than 5 years.
One indirect result has been a barrage of selling in the US government bond
markets. As the duration of mortgage-backed bonds rose, many investors sold
long-dated government bonds to hold down the average duration of their
portfolios.
The actions of regulators may have worsened the impact. US banks are under
pressure to show their CMOs at market value in their accounts. That means
that if prices are volatile, there is less incentive to hold such bonds.
Some regulatory pressure has been more direct. Worried about the losses that
some supposedly safe mutual funds have taken on complex financial
instruments, the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates US
investment markets, wrote to mutual fund managers earlier this month to warn
of the dangers. These funds should work out a way to 'dispose of the
securities in an orderly manner, consistent with the interests of the funds'
shareholders,' the SEC said.
The CMO debacle has revealed some of the shortcomings in the way modern
financial markets operate. Dealers and investors alike put much trust in the
ability of computer-driven analyses to predict what would happen to prices
in different market conditions. As things turned out, their assumptions were
wrong.
Also, they failed to take account of the risk inherent in tailor-made
financial instruments for which there is no ready market. The lack of a
market accentuated the price falls. And the fact that many unsophisticated
investors, such as local government treasurers, were sucked into the market,
is testimony to the poor controls in their organisations and the willingness
of investment banks to sell complex securities to people who do not really
understand them.
Nor are regulators and policy makers blameless. They failed to pay enough
attention to innovations in the CMO market at an earlier stage, and when
finally prodded by losses, may have over-reacted.
Like all market upsets, this one has created opportunities for contrary
investors. Other markets have seen turn-abouts: the US junk bond market,
pronounced dead at the end of the 1980s, roared back to life with a record
year in 1993. Investors who bought junk bonds at knock-down prices have made
their fortunes. The same is true of some CMOs, for those brave enough to buy
them. But in the current climate, there are few takers for toxic waste.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Some fight left in them: Reaction to the latest round of UK
defence cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Something unusual is going on in the rarefied world inhabited by the UK's
most senior generals, admirals and air marshals.
They are not complaining as loudly as might have been expected about the
government's latest economy drive, which will cost the defence establishment
more than 18,000 jobs and leave the forces even smaller than predicted by
the end of the decade.
But this does not mean that the atmosphere at the top of Britain's armed
forces is free from anxiety. While generally accepting the cuts announced
last week, the top brass is concerned about the next round of reductions
which - despite official protestations to the contrary - is widely expected
within three years.
They take some comfort from the fact that the measures announced by Mr
Malcom Rifkind, defence secretary, fell hardest on civilian employees of the
defence ministry, who lost 7,100 jobs. Service chiefs will shed few tears
about the trimming of a civilian bureaucracy to which they lost power in the
1980s under Mrs Thatcher.
Mr Rifkind even won some friends in the forces, by planning the MoD cuts
after wide consultation across the services and restoring to the service
chiefs some of the responsibilities they lost under his predecessors.
As one distinguished general privately commented: 'There is real hope now
that the principle of delegation to the service chiefs will now be applied -
and there is quiet rejoicing about the reduced size of the Ministry of
Defence.'
The other main victim of the cuts is the Royal Air Force, which will shed
7,500 jobs, as activities such as maintenance and training, previously
undertaken by airmen, are taken over by civilians. But even air force chiefs
 -who claimed to have warded off much deeper cuts than were finally decreed
 -have acknowledged the RAF was overmanned, compared with such formidable
air powers as Israel and Sweden.
So the job losses decreed by Mr Rifkind have been accepted with relatively
little complaint. Yet oddly enough, the minister's accompanying 'sweetener'
of a Pounds 5bn weapons procurement package has not laid to rest the forces'
fears about Britain's fighting strength in the medium term.
Virtually all the decisions announced by Mr Rifkind - some Pounds 2.4bn
worth of firm orders (for tanks, minehunters and ammunition) and Pounds
2.5bn in potential orders (for frigates, submarines and cruise missiles) -
were confirmations of purchases already announced in principle.
The MoD now admits that it could not have afforded the items on its shopping
list unless its newly announced drive to cut unnecessary costs and staff
jobs had been so wide-ranging.
This principle of trading weapons purchases for job losses has worrying
implications for the other procurement decisions to which the government is
committed in principle but for which it has not earmarked precise sums.
These 'decisions in principle' include the commitment to buy 250 Eurofighter
aircraft for at least Pounds 9bn from the year 2000; 12 new-generation
frigates for a total of about Pounds 3bn; and in the immediate future, new
attack helicopters.
In practice, the government may not be able to afford these systems unless
it is prepared to make further economies in personnel and other military
overheads.
Mr David Clark, Labour defence spokesman, reckons that by 1998-99, there
will be a Pounds 3.5bn shortfall between available revenues and total
defence spending commitments. 'The defence ministry knows this to be true,
but is keeping it quiet,' he maintains.
Fears over the looming shortfall are shared by many senior officers.
Mr Rifkind dismisses these concerns. He claims that even after last week's
cuts, Britain's fighting capacity remains unimpaired or even enhanced. This
view is supported by the reputation enjoyed by the UK's forces at home and
abroad. The army's stock has surged as a result of its performance in
Bosnia, where a tiny UK force of 3,000 men has played a crucial role in
bringing relative normality to the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.
This has been achieved by the army's employment of the old-fashioned - not
to say imperialist - skills of bluff and brinkmanship in the handling of
conflict; and it has won the army some new friends in unfamiliar quarters,
beginning with the Labour party.
The army's influence in Nato is also at a high point. UK officers run the
showpiece of the alliance: the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps, which brings
together the forces of up to 12 nations for any purpose, from humanitarian
aid to high-intensity tank warfare.
But as service chiefs are aware, the UK's prowess in military affairs rests
on thin ice. The latest round of cuts will leave the ice a little thinner;
and the next round could bring the forces to breaking point.
Prestigious as it is, engagement in Bosnia is stretching the forces to the
limits of their capacity. For example, the deployment of ships in the
Adriatic is close to exhausting available navy resources.
Only by the skin of their teeth were the UK forces able to transport one
extra battalion to Bosnia earlier this year. The operation involved 36
flights by the RAF's ageing fleet of Hercules transporters, and the use of
three of the navy's five landing ships, one of which was sent for overhaul
this week.
An acutely embarrassing situation could arise if the next Bosnia-type crisis
breaks out in the next two years when the forces are in the middle of a
painful transfer from military to civilian logistics. Mr Michael Clark, of
London University's Centre for Defence Studies, says the government is
taking a 'calculated risk' that it will not be wrong-footed by an unexpected
crisis.
The UK's last two wars - in the Falklands and the Gulf - were unpleasant
surprises and left in smithereens the conventional wisdom of the moment
about defence needs.
In both conflicts, the government benefited from good luck. In the Gulf, the
forces had just enough time to prepare their weapons for battle, and the war
was short enough to avoid difficult questions about ammunitions supplies.
Politicians may have forgotten the role of luck and the dangers of assuming
it will hold; but generals and admirals have not. While they have adopted a
relatively low-key response to the current round of cuts, they warn that
further sacrifices in manpower and weaponry would incur risks for which they
will not be held responsible.

<TEXT>
When Mr John Smith died, it seemed plain that if the Labour party elected Mr
Tony Blair as his successor we would have to consider voting centre-left. It
has, and we are. Considering, that is. The electorate will do a great deal
of considering over the coming two to three years. It is likely to be
presented with an agonising choice, between a reformed Labour party that it
can probably trust, and a stabilised Conservative government that may be
stale and untrustworthy, but is at least a known quantity. The Liberal
Democrats will be squeezed.
If the election was held next Thursday many of us would take a chance on Mr
Blair. The temptation would be overwhelming. Turfing the present government
out would be like removing tight shoes. As to 1996-97, who knows? The
campaign, which we shall have to endure for 24 or maybe 30 months, starts
now. It is going to be one hell of a game of poker. In one of the key pots
the hole card will be covered by the flat paw of Mr Eddie George, governor
of the Bank of England.
The quasi-independence of the bank is something new in post-1945 politics.
Management of the economy is no longer solely a matter between the prime
minister and/or the chancellor, as it was in the Thatcher-Lawson years. The
publication of the minutes of discussions on monetary policy between Mr
Kenneth Clarke and Mr George gives the latter huge influence. This is not a
consequence of Mr Clarke's far-sighted statesmanship. It happened because
when the elected politicians ran affairs policy crumbled in their hands, as
in 1988 and again on Black Wednesday. If, as he surely will, Mr George
argues strongly for an increase in interest rates during the next few months
he will be almost impossible to resist, particularly if he carries Mr Clarke
with him. Mr John Major may protest that raising the cost of mortgages could
damage his government's health. Tough.
The prime minister does show some strong-ish cards. On Wednesday he tidied
his cabinet, and made extensive changes lower down. Let us just say, 'fine'.
We do not need to spend time on the merits of one set of nonentities as
against another. Nonentities? I exclude Mrs Gillian Shephard, the new
education secretary. She is sensible, a real person. I have great
expectations there. The rest of the list is too dull to rehearse at the
beginning of the political holidays. There will be plenty of time to debate
the merits of shooting this or that grey squirrel when the season resumes in
the autumn. Here is the executive summary: the purpose of the reshuffle was
to win the favour of the Tory party, and keep order among backbenchers by
feeding their dreams of preferment. It has apparently achieved that.
Partly for this reason, Mr Major seems likely to stay in office. His party
is still divided, but he has constructed a European policy that minimises
those divisions. It may not last. The European sticking-plaster, like his
premiership, is a product of the continued support of the foreign secretary
and the chancellor. The former will probably retire next year; the latter is
a recognised rival for the top job. For the moment, however, both are in
place. The run of political misfortune has not quite come to an end, but, in
spite of the apparent willingness of a couple of Tory backbenchers to sell
parliamentary questions at a grand a time, it seems to be dribbling out.
There are other not-so-bad cards in Mr Major's hand. The recession is over,
although the voters stubbornly refuse to recognise this. Perhaps too many
personal bank balances are still receding. The Treasury is aware that it
will be called upon to forecast a sufficient recovery in the public finances
to allow for tax cuts in the Budgets of 1995 or 1996. Against that, the
Conservative party lied copiously about its instincts on taxation in 1992.
Some voters may remember this next time.
Mr Blair is ostensibly better placed. He shows aces up and presumably has
more in the hole. His victory yesterday demonstrated that the Labour party
is now the property of the modernisers, and he their master. He won the
votes of 60 per cent of the members of the Westminster and European
parliaments, almost as high a share of constituency party members' support,
and more than half the trade union ballot. We can, however, discard the
latter. It is history. With less than a fifth of those eligible bothering to
take part, the vote of union members was an anachronistic appendage to what
was otherwise a remarkable democratic primary.
The new leader's acceptance speech was suitably inspiring. It could have
been drafted in Little Rock. Mr Blair's campaign is reminiscent of President
Clinton's. The new, telegenic, young leaders offer hope and renewal after
the bumbling years of Bush/Major and the earlier, fearsome, reigns of
Thatcher/Reagan. Mr Clinton as president is not an encouraging role model,
but the way he ran for office has one overwhelming advantage. He won.
It is customary to demand of Mr Blair that he produce some specific, costed
policies. It may be that just as it is the job of commentators and his
political opponents to ask this of him, so it is in his and Labour's
interests to resist, to withhold hostages to fortune. His speech yesterday
was his, not ours. It was addressed to his party, reasonably enough, and to
the wider anxieties of middle England. 'The task of national renewal is to
provide opportunity and security in this world of change,' he said. There
were crunchier nuggets: 'we do not want people living in dependency on state
handouts' and 'we will not run the quango state of the Tories with different
managers, we will get rid of it and return power to local people'.
This first big set-piece speech pleased his audience of Labour and union
dignitries. Their applause expressed a degree of unity of purpose
traditionally reserved for Tory leader-worship gatherings. There was no
old-style, horse-and-buggy, nationalising, taxing, high-spending socialist
blather in it. Mr Blair talked, as the best Conservatives do, of 'one
nation'. He referred, as business leaders do, to Labour's 'mission'. He
rejected 'the student gospel of Marxism'. It was an impressive start. In due
course, someone must call, so that we can see the rest of his cards, face
up.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Mail idea misses point
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr FRANK KNOWLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Parker's argument ('Personal View, July 14) that higher postal
delivery costs in rural areas should lead to higher charges for people
living in the country seems to miss an essential element in the postal
service - it is the sender of the letter not the recipient who pays the
postage. Are the increased delivery costs to be borne purely by people
sending letters to the country, or is he suggesting that a rural dweller
sending mail from the country to a city should pay more based on increased
collection costs? There are good economic reasons for keeping a uniform
letter rate, not least the significant costs saved by the simplicity of the
system, which Mr Parker seems to ignore.
Mr Parker also suggests that 'those who would prefer a better service are
given no opportunity to pay for it unless they resort to expensive premium
services such as Datapost.' Surely Datapost is a shining example of applying
the cost-based charging system. If the Post Office can offer a 'better'
service without charging premium prices or cross subsidising other
operations I for one will be a satisfied customer.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Aid to Air France will hit emergence
of low-cost airlines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN PARR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We here disturbed to read the report by Emma Tucker and John Ridding on
Air France's bid for further state aid ('Brussels set to back state aid for
ailing Air France', July 21).
The further propping up of this carrier will do as much harm to air
transport users as it will to competitor airlines. Under pressure from the
French government, Air France is flying routes that are not economically
viable given its cost structure. This not only undermines the profitability
of current competitors but also deters the emergence of new low-cost
airlines.
It is vital that the Commission requires Air France to make big cuts in
capacity. In markets which are not overshadowed by a state-supported carrier
we are now witnessing a significant number of new services, often provided
by new regional airlines.
These carriers must be able to establish themselves now, as air travel
growth resumes, if they are to stand any chance of longer-term survival. The
provision of more state aid can only hinder them and will for the
foreseeable future deny users the full benefits of liberalisation.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Subsidised elegance - but can you
bank on it?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID SAWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, it is obvious that Clement Crisp considers that one purpose of
government subsidies to the arts is to foster gracious living ('The decline
and fall of elegance', July 18). But if the objective is to ensure that the
audience at the Royal Opera House is dressed in a style that is appropriate
to the faded elegance of that Victorian building, surely it would be
inefficient to give the management of the opera house a larger subsidy:
experience suggests that it would spend the extra money on more lavish
productions rather than cheaper seats, or fewer sales of drink and food.
Subsidies to the audience are more efficient than subsidies to the managers,
and in this case they should be related to the audience's dress. The Royal
Opera House, and other theatres, should be awarded additional subsidies so
that they can offer discounts on ticket prices to those who guarantee to
attend in appropriate clothes.
Such discounts could be graded to the standard of dress worn - say 25 per
cent off for evening dress and 15 per cent for suit and tie, with special
discounts for those who wear clothes from a list of designated tailors and
designers.
The National Lottery would be the obvious source of funds for such
additional subsidies. What would be more appropriate than to take money from
the proletarians who are likely to be the biggest users of the lottery,
because they are too thick to calculate the odds against winning, and give
it to those people who appreciate the finer things in life. It is, after
all, the principle behind the government's existing plans to use revenue
from the lottery to increase its support for the arts.

</HEADLINE>

   From Mr DAVID DOCHERTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, ITV's claim of a 50 per cent increase in its lead over BBC1
misrepresents the facts ('ITV claims advance over Sky channels', July 20).
The reverse is true. The gap so far this year has narrowed. BBC1 has held
its ground against the ever-widening choices offered by satellite and cable
and ITV has lost some share.
Moreover, BBC1 has achieved this stability with a much more diverse schedule
than ITV - in which religion, current affairs, challenging documentaries,
and music programmes retain a secure place in peak-time. As a footnote, your
story also ignores the fact that the terrestrial channels take a 65-70 per
cent share in cable and satellite homes.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: A route to give more power to the
people
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAAL MYHRVANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In a representative democracy, individuals are elected by the will of
the people. This responsibility may often create dissatisfaction among the
very people the representatives have been elected to represent. In light of
this, Charles Leadbeater and Andrew Adonis, in their article 'Power to the
people' (July 15), put forward persuasive arguments for greater involvement
of the electorate in the decision-making process.
Appropriately, in a world where information flows freely, technology is
available to allow electronic voting and, most importantly, the voting
population are highly educated individuals very much capable of taking many
of the decisions, a case for stronger influence of direct democracy is
present. Leadbeater and Adonis' remedies, however, will not do much to
resolve the problems. True, voter vetoes in the form of referenda will
induce a greater degree of responsibility of the representatives, but this
suggestion, along with the two others, voter juries and voter feed-back, are
rather more likely to fuel the already destructive tendency of voters'
resentment of politicians. This will exacerbate further the efficiency of
decision-making. The first proposal will have this effect through leaving
decisions open to reversal as the veto will, by definition, be imposed
post-decision. The second one will let a body which is very likely to be
totally unrepresentative of the population advise on decision-making, only
to be 'overruled' by the representative body.
A better approach would be to introduce a clear division of powers between
the people and the representatives, and let the decisions be made
irreversibly by the people in those areas they are given the power to do so.
Ideally, these powers would cover areas where representatives today have the
power to prevent the transfer of, or even increase, their own powers. This
would, for example, be relevant in a transfer of a national parliament's
powers to a supranational body. The people should, furthermore, have a
strict procedure under which they can transfer more powers to or from their
own hands. Paal Myhrvang,

Sir, Professor Wynne Godley and Mr William Milberg (Letters, July 18) appear
to overlook the simple fact that the US's foreign indebtedness will continue
to rise as long as its domestic saving is insufficient to match its domestic
investment. The US's trade problem (if there is one) lies in the country's
low propensity to save, not in an overvalued exchange rate.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Arts: Kronos goes against grain - Music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hugely hyped as usual, the Kronos Quartet are playing the Barbican this
week. They are the string quartet who sprang to fame in the early 1970s, by
performing in extravagant designer gear, cultivating 'cross-over' music
(sometimes between classical and pop, more often between classical and
ethnic) and playing rather well.
Or rather, they are almost not that group - their leader David Harrington is
the sole remaining member of the original team. Presumably the Kronos 'idea'
survives transient personnel.
The zeitgeist blows unpredictably, and super-sharp costumes now look naff.
These days, Kronos dresses down while trading as always upon theatrical
lighting - blue for sincere rumination, red for excitement, perpetual
darkness in the auditorium. Most of Tuesday's programme was on that level of
sophistication, and any four competent side-men could have delivered most of
it with minimal rehearsal.
The jazz clarinettist Don Byron's There Goes the Neighbourhood, for example,
set solos over mildly dissonant, rocking accompaniments, laboriously written
out for quartet. Jon Hassell did much the same in Pano da Costa
(African-based, but with Brazilian percussion for the players to manage),
another commission, and Hirokazu Hiraishi too in Prismatic Soundscape
(sub-Takemitsu).
Kronos had also commissioned three arrangements from the late Raymond
Scott's commercial work - sprightly, but too tame on mere strings - and
invited Ingram Marshall to rewrite his 1982 Fog Tropes, which blended live
brass with recorded foghorns, for strings instead: thus wrecking the blend
and also revealing a seriously incompetent composer.
The string-quartet medium is not God-given, but rests upon its base in Haydn
and on what successive composers have made of it - Mozart, Beethoven,
Schubert, Schoenberg, Bartok, Elliott Carter. Dialogue and argument are the
whole point: four individual string voices can be just enough to encompass a
small world of intense expression.
To reduce the players to uniform, faceless accompanists is not to 'extend'
the medium, but to diminish it radically. On Tuesday evening, the only works
that told were Dmitri Yanov-Yanovsky's lugubrious mini-concerto for chang (a
kind of cimbalom) and Peter Sculthorpe's From Ubirr, a respectful,
old-fashioned celebration of the one-note didgeridoo (David Coulter).
It was reassuring on Wednesday to find that the (current) Kronos team can
sound like a quartet. They played all four of Alfred Schnittke's
introspective works for the medium, thoughtfully and searchingly. In the
Third and Fourth Quartets - the one freighted with melancholy recalls old
Russian chorales and folk-stuff, the other with no more than a few
major/minor triads - the Kronos team were a model of grave, delicate
sympathy.
Truth to tell, Harrington's own part sounded underpowered against the rest
of the trio. His fine, taut line was too light and unauthoritative for
Schnittke's purposes; it never grabbed us.
Though electronic enhancement is second nature to the Kronos, one should not
count upon it to do the job. Schnittke still writes for a 'classical'
quartet, and for all their virtues the Kronos Quartet is still something
less than that.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Arts: Clash of the piano greats - The start of a concert
tour that brings together two of rock's giants, Elton John and Billy Joel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK LIPSIUS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Billed as the battle of the great piano rockers, the 24-date Billy Joel  -
Elton John US stadium tour brings together two confident superstars ambling
through 20 years of their repertoire.
The four-storey high set depicting the American War of Independence with
Redcoats and tricorned Americans conveys less of the regal atmosphere than
the shield atop the proscenium with the legend 'Heart and Soul' flanked by
the British lion and American eagle.
The paired grand pianos on-stage at Philadelphia's Veterans Stadium, where
the tour started with three shows, were closer together than the two
performers, despite a warm embrace at the start.
Elton John acted the shy guest, putting lusty lungs behind the songs with
little audience eye contact. He had been invited to join the show by Joel,
ostensibly after a decade-long courtship, but the dual billing was timed to
coincide with a crowded summer of superstar stadium tours by Pink Floyd,
Barbra Streisand and the Eagles, as well as the packaged events Woodstock
'94 and Lollapalooza (in its fourth year as a Woodstock for alternative rock
acts).
John started with his first hit, 'Your Song', followed by Joel singing
'Honesty'. John did Joel's 'New York State of Mind' saying that they had
agreed to sing one of each other's songs. This made Joel sound insincere in
his effusive intro to John's 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road'.
When they took their turns separately, they sang truncated but generous sets
of their greatest hits. Returning together for the finale, they moved beyond
the predictable with an oldies medley and a duet of the Beatles' 'Hard Day's
Night'.
John used to make his body reverberate with the intensity of his fingers
pounding the keyboard. In this concert the piano still pounded out jangling
harmonies, but his expression was placid. His range of emotion was embodied
in a modest costume change from a loose grey suit to a white linen jacket
and finally a blue satin jacket. Even his spectacles were modest
yellow-tinted half-frames. It was positively demure by Elton's standards.
John got the audience to their feet with 'Philadelphia Freedom', but the
20-to-50-year-old crowd sat for the rest of the hour-long set, which
included his current number-one hit from The Lion King, 'Can You Feel the
Love Tonight', performed like a music video to the film's animated sequence.
The camera caught him at his most animated during 'Baby, You're the One'
gesticulating to his crew to turn his monitor down.
Joel was far more the showman. He soon removed his loose-fitting grey suit
jacket and rolled up the sleeves of his black T-shirt, swinging the
microphone stand as he strutted across the stage.
His good spirits seemed only spurred on by a sudden crisis when his drummer,
who had been food poisoned, left the stage. Joel quickly filled in with
John's drummer, whom he instructed before each song - back to the audience,
arms flailing.
Joel reached deep into his repertoire for songs such as 'Billy the Kid', but
he kept the audience on their feet singing the words.
These were obviously Billy Joel fans, happy to get a look at Elton John and
have a 3 1/2 -hour performance from the two piano rocking greats, but they
were there for the one whose finale 'Piano Man' sent them out singing into
the sweltering summer night.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Arts: Patsy's star shines brightly - Musical
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is becoming very predictable. You enter a theatre auditorium to see the
cast already hamming it up on stage. Their eyes light up at the sight of an
audience and they jump down into the stalls to greet it with many a
'howyadoing' and 'glad to see ya'. Eventually they re-assemble and yet
another bio-musical begins.
In fact, Patsy Cline, A Musical Tribute is better than most, mainly because
it has an impressive star, Sandy Kelly, playing Patsy and partly because it
concentrates on the music - there are more than 40 songs - and sketches in
the short life of this country icon with as much detail as a leader in The
Sun.
It is hard to deny that getting herself killed in a plane crash at the age
of 31 was a shrewd career move for the singer: it ensures an untarnished
reputation and that her records sell well - although, as in her lifetime
when she was signed to a typic-ally Machiavellian producer, Patsy fails to
enjoy the royalties.
Surprisingly Mervyn Conn's production makes little of the drama of her
death. It excels, however, in projecting the other great characteristic of
Cline, a stunningly resonant voice, so different from the usual country
whine. It makes a Cline recording instantly recognisable to this day and
enabled her to become the first female singer to move from the country
charts to pop.
Cline spent most of her life on stage so it is acceptable that the set is a
rough-up of the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville with a large cast of musicians
who periodically - with hit and miss success - lapse into acting, mainly
portraying the men who Cline climbed over to reach the top.
The show has toured the country for months which provides a good ensemble
feel but the performances are workmanlike when set against Sandy Kelly. She
catches the heartbreak in Cline's voice with emotional perfection and the
tortured ballads - 'Crazy', 'I fall to Pieces', 'Sweet Dreams' - come out
newly minted.
George Hamilton IV (the 'IV' embroidered on his waistcoat is the giveaway)
gives her generous self-effacing support as a narrator who actually knew
Patsy Cline.
Go see the musical for the salty Kelly and for the music, the short,
escapist, tuneful, country songs which seem so refreshingly innocent
compared with modern grunge.
Do not expect much in the way of character development or in-depth
examination of the Nashville music scene of the 1950s.

Today's concert in the BBC Proms 1994 season is a repeat of the programme in
which Bernard Haitink made his Prom debut 30 years ago. He conducts the BBC
Symphony Orchestra in Beethoven's Coriolan overture, Mozart's Sinfonia
Concertante (Thomas Zehetmair violin, Tabea Zimmermann viola) and Bruckner's
immense 7th symphony (7.30 Radio 3). In The Jupiter Collision Carolyn and
Gene Shoemaker and David Levy, who gave their names to the comet due to hit
Jupiter last weekend, assess the effects of the collision (8.00 BBC2).
Michael Moore is the American who made the programme about trying to
interview the chairman of General Motors. Now he begins a series, Michael
Moore's TV Nation, which goes further afield. He begins (9.30 BBC2) by
meeting Serbian and Croatian diplomats to settle 'this whole war thing'.
Channel 4 is running repeats of The Golden Girls but not stating whether
they will be shown in order (9.30). BBC2 begins Woodstock Diary a three-part
programme marking the 25th anniversary of the famous rock happening (11.15).

FT  22 JUL 94 / Arts: A thundering start to Proms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The label Mahlerian is often used too loosely, yet it seems appropriate for
Tuesday's Prom conducted by Simon Rattle.
Besides the Adagio from Mahler's Tenth Symphony, the programme included
Berg's early Altenberg Lieder and Shostakovich's Fourth Symphony, a work
over which the Austrian symphonist's spectre looms large.
Rattle and 'his' City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra have a reputation in
Mahler's last work. Here Rattle conducted - from memory - the opening
movement with a liquid, flowing baton, shaping the CBSO's smooth strings in
passionate arches of melody. He built up the sonorous, organ-like climax
massively, and maintained the intensity in the music's dying phrases.
Much in the five Altenberg Lieder reveals Berg's musical roots in Mahler -
but not the startling orchestral opening, in which complex ostinatos conjure
up the snowstorm of the first poem. Rattle conducted with incisive clarity,
revelling in the colourful sonorities but occasionally smothering the
soprano soloist, Heather Harper.
Miss Harper - who has come out of retirement to sing in two Proms this year
 -showed her affinity with the music: she made each of Berg's concentrated
phrases (the score is a model of economy) tell, and found lyricism in the
searching lines.
Shostakovich's baffling Fourth Symphony is seldom played. In an act of
self-censorship, the composer suppressed it for 25 years; had it been
premiered in 1936 as scheduled, its revisiting of Mahler's emotional world
would almost certainly have brought down Stalin's wrath on Shostakovich
(significantly, one of the composers approached to complete Mahler's Tenth,
though he declined).
Another suggestion of Mahler was in the sheer size of Shostakovich's
orchestra, and here the CBSO flexed its collective muscle with shattering
results. From the thrusting opening chords, this was high-voltage Rattle,
but he rather overplayed the work's quirkiness that can obscure the anguish
bottled up inside.
Above all, this was a performance that brought home the horror that the
still-idealistic Shostakovich was glimpsing.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Arts: All change in game of musical chairs - London's
orchestras are having trouble finding new musical directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Philharmonia confirmed this week that the contract of its music director
Guiseppe Sinopoli has been terminated, making official what had been known
informally for months.
Although Sinopoli was a great showman, and brought the orchestra a valuable
recording contract with DGG, his idiosyncratic interpretations of the great
romantic symphonies had not always charmed the critics.
This means that two of London's four main orchestras are seeking music
directors. Last month the LPO parted company with the equally controversial
Franz Welser-Most, a Young Turk who also failed to win round the critics.
What is going wrong and where are the orchestras to find successors?
If you have any bright ideas they would be delighted to hear. There is a
scarcity of top-flight conductors at the moment, and those with sufficient
musical and commercial weight are reluctant to come to London. It is
becoming apparent that the Art Council's ill-fated attempt last year to kill
off one or two London orchestras in the quest for a super-orchestra has cast
a pall over the city's musical scene.
To outsiders the long-term future of all the orchestras seems uncertain. Who
wants to take on bands of financially stressed and worried musicians in a
city where competition is intense, audiences world-weary and fickle, and
where there is a chance that the orchestra could go belly-up within a year
or two. Best to stay put in a North American or European city where you are
cock of the walk.
Both orchestras, which share residency at London's South Bank Centre
(although the LPO has pole position), urgently need a good music director to
give a shape and authority to their work.
All the great orchestras of recent years - Berlin, Chicago, Cleveland - have
been associated with great conductors such as Karajan, Solti, Dohnanyi. Who
will rescue the LPO and the Philharmonia?
Unfortunately the man they both wanted, the brilliant young Mariss Jansons,
has turned them down: perhaps he has his eyes fixed on St Petersburg. The
alternatives seem lacklustre in comparison.
The Philharmonia has close links with Christoph von Dohnanyi and John Eliot
Gardiner, but the former is too firmly entrenched at Cleveland to want the
hassle of London and Gardiner is best suited for occasional visits than as a
permanent force. The Philharmonia might consider Nikolaus Harnoncourt, but
no quick or obvious answer is on the horizon.
The LPO could well be seeking its future in its past and might get together
again with Bernard Haitink, its former music director who is now styled
president.
His years at Covent Garden are drawing to an end and Haitink would be a safe
pair of hands: but is he the man to excite a new, younger, audience? The LPO
would probably love someone who has demonstrably lifted the reputation of an
orchestra, such as Charles Dutoit at Montreal, but can it afford him, and
would he want to come?
Ironically, while the two London orchestras agonise, a leading regional
orchestra, the Bournemouth Symphony, this week nipped in quickly and secured
one of the brighter young talents, Yakov Kreizberg, as its principal
conductor.
Kreizberg, a 34-year-old Russian, might well have been the man to liven up
London if the orchestras had been faster on their feet.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Property: One for the gamblers - Office investment is a
triumph of hope over experience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW OAKESHOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Institutions began measuring the performance of their property portfolios
about 25 years ago. Their office investments have since enjoyed only two
short spurts in which they have out-performed shops and industrial property,
in the early 1970s and the late 1980s. These were the two wildest
speculative booms this century. Both ended in decline in the general
property market and disaster for office investments. Otherwise offices have
persistently underperformed retail and industrial property in both capital
and rental values.
There are two main reasons why the rotten record of offices is taking so
long to be recognised - large lot sizes (which institutions understand) and
depreciation (which most do not). UK institutions have swung from inertia to
hyperactivity over the past decade in their allocation of assets between
property and other areas of investment.
In the early 1980s, most self-managed funds gave no sign of having any
policy on what the property proportion of total assets should be. Now
institutions have moved to the other extreme. Many seem to look no more than
a year ahead; there is thus pressure to pour large sums into property in a
hurry when it 'looks right', as has happened over the past year. Fund
managers under pressure chase lumpy investments, usually big office blocks.
Once the bloom comes off the property rose (a process which started recently
in the UK when the cold winds blew from the bond markets) and the asset
managers want to cut back on property, the selling pressure then becomes
greatest on the same big office blocks which have been used to force money
into the market on the way up.
Offices have a worse long-term record than the market as a whole, and are
more volatile than the other sectors. They provide spectacular profits for
the few developers and dealers who get their timing right. Meanwhile the
institutions predictably got their timing wrong in the last upturn, with
their two heaviest years' spending on office development occurring just as
the bubble burst in 1988 and 1990.
Investors always underestimate the costs of office depreciation and changing
occupational requirements. These are much higher than for shops, and
slightly higher than for industrial/warehouse property.
Investors therefore need at least as thick a cushion of running yield on
offices as on industrials to compensate for the much higher long-term
holding costs compared with a typical high street shop, where the value is
mostly in the land.
Well located shops do not depreciate, but offices and industrial properties
always have done, since the building element represents a big part of the
total value. No matter how well designed, buildings do wear out and the way
people work in offices changes even faster. This hits the office investor,
as an example of a new office building let on a 25-year lease shows.
The investor buys his shiny new office at a prime (low) yield - say, 8 per
cent or 7 per cent now. For the first few years, the rental value grows in
line with rents in other new offices; perhaps even at the second rent review
(after 10 years) growth is still maintaining that pattern. But by the third
rent review (after 15 years), obsolescence of both kinds is beginning to
take its toll, with the rent rise lagging new office rents by, say, 1 per
cent a year, with a further 1 per cent a year lag by year 20, and another 2
per cent a year in the run-up to the end of the lease after 25 years.
Then the investor has a building with no guarantee of future income, where
the tenant may be prepared to stay but will be in a strong position to
demand either refurbishment from the investor, or a rent below new
state-of-the-art offices, or both. The investor will have suffered slowing
income growth, and possible extra capital expenditure and a capital loss on
the final valuation as well, since the yield on which the 25-year-old
property is valued will have moved up sharply - say, to 9-10 per cent if
prime yields on new offices are still 6-7 per cent.
Offices are overpriced, and institutions are over-invested in them on any
assessment of their long-term record. Though institutions have been net
sellers of office investments according to Investment Property Databank, a
research group, over the past nine years, and the office proportion has
fallen from two-thirds in the early 1970s to two-fifths today, offices are
still the largest sector in most portfolios.
This weighting reflects a triumph of hope over experience. In the early
1970s, yields on office and shop investments were similar. Industrial yields
were 2-3 per cent higher to allow for depreciation and obsolescence. In the
past few years, office yields have moved above shop yields, with the gap
about 1 1/2 per cent at present. As the evidence of poor office rental
growth and ever-increasing depreciation costs piles up, office yields should
move above industrial/warehouse yields and stay there for the foreseeable
future.
In any other market, an investment sector with as poor and risky a record as
offices would stand on the lowest rating and highest yield. In property,
tradition and inertia can spread fundamental changes like this out over many
years. But investors' downgrading of offices is under way and may
accelerate, as their approach to property investment grows more like their
techniques in equity and bonds.
Today, institutions can collectively reduce their office weightings very
fast so long as overseas buyers, with their fixation on large London
offices, don't wake up in time. You may even find a bigger fool to buy your
office in a few years if you buy or develop it today - but all the evidence
of the past 25 years points clearly to retail and industrial property
consistently performing better than offices. Offices are for gamblers,
developers and middlemen, not serious long-term investors.

Bio Products Laboratory, part of the National Blood Service, has launched a
highly purified blood product for the treatment of haemophilia.
Replenine is a concentrated form of purified Factor IX, the clotting agent
needed by people with haemophilia B to prevent bleeding. The Factor IX in
Replenine is 10,000 times purer than in the original plasma from which it is
manufactured.
The purification is based on metal chelate chromatography, a process that
uses copper to capture Factor IX from the plasma, while minimising damage to
the protein.

UK broadcasters are launching a trial of a system which will make television
programmes more accessible to people with sight problems.
Over the next four months, a number of programmes on ITV and the BBC will be
broadcast with a data signal carrying an audio commentary describing what
happens in the programme during gaps in the dialogue.
The Audetel system uses set-top receivers which transmit the commentary
through headphones or a loudspeaker.
The system was primarily developed to give people with sight problems
greater access to television but it is also intended to appeal to other
viewers who want to follow a programme while doing something else.
The system has been developed by a consortium including the Age &amp; Cognitive
Research Centre at Manchester University, BBC, ITC, ITV Association,
Motorola and the Royal National Institute for the Blind.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Worm's eye view of pollution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Earthworms are being used to detect the long-term effects of environmental
pollution.
Scientists from the UK's Natural Environment Research Council believe
information from earthworm cells provides a simple, effective technique to
assess the presence of heavy metals, dioxins and other potentially harmful
chemicals.
Body fluid cells are taken from earthworms in contaminated areas. The cells
are then exposed to a dye that is absorbed by the cells' lysosomes. If the
earthworm has been exposed to pollutants, the dye is released rapidly; in
normal earthworms, the dye is released slowly.
This type of 'biomarker' technique is useful in cases where traditional
chemical analysis cannot provide a comprehensive or accurate enough
assessment of the long-term effects of a cocktail of contaminants,
particularly in seas, lakes and rivers.
The earthworm work is one of the first applications of biomarker techniques
on land. It has helped in the assessment of the environmental impacts of
waste products from gold mining in Africa.

The strains of map-reading while driving through an unfamiliar city could be
eased when Amerigon, a Californian company, introduces a voice-operated car
navigation system later this year.
Its AudioNav system, which connects to a car's compact disc player, will
provide recorded voice directions in response to the driver's spoken
commands, which are transmitted through a microphone clipped to the driver's
sun visor.
The system, which uses digital map data converted to an audio compact disc
format, is able to identify the origin of the trip, its destination and the
fastest route. It uses map data, produced by Etak, a Californian subsidiary
of News Corporation, which covers the US and metropolitan areas in Europe
and Japan.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Technology: Reality catches up with vision - Neil Buckley
concludes a series on electronic retailing by looking at multimedia's
unstoppable rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Step into the store of the future. Just inside the doorway is a kiosk
containing an interactive computer terminal that will become your personal
guide to the store, showing you what is on offer, giving information on
products in attractive audio-visual displays, and eventually taking your
order and payment.
Multimedia, the combination of sound, moving and still pictures, graphics
and text on a computer screen, has long been seen as one of the most
exciting new technologies for retailers. It is potentially a powerful tool
for communicating with customers and improving service and sales.
Unlike many technological changes in retailing which have occurred behind
the scenes, multimedia is a highly visible way of using technology to
enhance the customer's shopping experience.
Until now, the reality has lagged behind the vision. Retailers have been
cautious about exploring the possibilities of multimedia, regarding it as a
solution waiting for a problem.
However, Don Jackson, a consultant specialising in multimedia with ICL
Retail Systems in the UK, says following demonstrations of multimedia given
by ICL earlier this year, 48 retailers from several countries have expressed
interest.
'At last the technology has caught up with the hype,' he says. 'Retailers
are recognising and accepting the benefits. We could see significant
movement next year.'
He adds that the progression from electronic points of sale, the biggest
retail innovation of the 1980s, to electronic points of service, is a
logical and natural one.
Crude forms of multimedia have been around since the early 1980s, when
computers linked to laser discs began to be used in shops to provide visual
displays.
What makes modern multimedia systems more attractive to retailers is the
ability to integrate them into their logistics and distribution systems, and
to make them interactive. That gives customers the opportunity to control
information displayed on the screen rather than watching a pre-recorded
sequence.
The in-store kiosk assists customers in selecting their purchases and
eliminates problems caused by store assistants having inadequate knowledge
of products, by offering customers far more information than could be
retained in the head of shop staff.
Moreover, by including a video camera in the terminal, the screen could
display an image of what a particular garment, for example, would look like
on a customer, and show the garment in a range of colours or sizes. The
system could also be programmed to suggest alternatives if an item was out
of stock, or additional purchases linked to the main purchase.
A more advanced version of the multimedia kiosk would include a credit card
reader to allow customers to pay for goods and a link communicating the
order to the stockroom, and if necessary triggering re-order of items from
the manufacturer.
It might also record the customer's choice, as well as the alternatives
considered by the customer and the length of time spent looking at different
parts of the catalogue, to allow the retailer to build up a profile of the
shopper's preferences. This could be linked to a loyalty scheme, whereby
regular shoppers would receive 'smart' cards which they would insert into
the multimedia kiosk, allowing the system to 'recognise' them, greet them
and offer discounts or inform them of special offers.
The development of multimedia kiosks opens up other possibilities. They
could, for example, be placed in shop windows or outside stores, to allow
customers to look through the catalogue and even place orders outside shop
opening hours. Kiosks could be removed from the store altogether, and placed
in areas of high customer traffic such as airports, railway stations or even
office reception areas.
From there, it would only be a short leap to customers being able to access
the systems from their homes, once sophisticated digital communications
networks are developed. 'There are retailers who look on current multimedia
systems as a stepping stone to proper, interactive home shopping systems,'
says Jackson.
In addition to allowing stores to provide better service, and understand
their customers better, the most important benefit of multimedia is likely
to be to enable retailers to carry much wider ranges.
As customers grow accustomed to using multimedia, retailers might be able to
reduce and eventually abandon display items altogether, storing products in
a stockroom with customers picking up their orders from service points. That
would allow greater ranges to be sold from the same, or less, floorspace.
For the moment, examples of multimedia being used in retailing remain
isolated.
Woolworths in the UK has experimented with a system called MV offering a
15,000-item catalogue of home entertainment products and giving the customer
the chance of browsing and listening to or viewing clips before purchasing
them.
Ford is one of several car manufacturers introducing interactive terminals
into showrooms to allow customers to see their chosen car in the colour and
with the specifications they want.
Comsys of Belgium has developed a system already being used by some Belgian
hairdressers to enable customers to choose a hairstyle from a database of
4,000 styles and see an impression of how it would look on them. In Denmark,
estate agents are using multimedia kiosks to present information about
properties on the market.
At London's Heathrow Airport, Galleria 21 has installed 24 multimedia kiosks
for duty-free shopping designed by the John Herbert Partnership, and using
multimedia technology developed by AT&amp;T.
One of the most advanced test programmes so far has been by Argos, the UK
catalogue retailer. It introduced eight multimedia terminals into stores
last autumn, and is installing another 12 this summer.
Argos' catalogue-based format lends itself naturally to multimedia, and the
system, known as Impact (Interactive Multimedia Project - Argos Customer
Terminal) offers both an electronic version of the catalogue and payment
facilities.
Geoff Robinson, director of information systems, told a retailing conference
earlier this year that the project had been a success, producing positive
reactions from customers and staff, and achieving significant sales
increases.
However, he added, usage rates by customers were only half the rate hoped
for as it was often quicker to go through standard tills if the queue was
short, the terminals were not promoted heavily enough or put in sufficiently
prominent positions in the store, and the software was sometimes too slow
and not exciting enough.
Argos says it has tried to rectify these problems with its second generation
of terminals, but its experience demonstrates the complexities of getting
the most from retail multimedia systems.
Multimedia is also likely to be more beneficial in some areas of retailing
than in others. Those with most to gain are likely to be fashion stores and
health and beauty chains, high street banks and sellers of complex and
expensive items such as electrical and electronic goods retailers, and
travel agents. The technology is expected to make less of an impact in
grocery retailing, although it could be used for menu and recipe suggestions
and to guide customers around stores.
Julia Schofield, of Julia Schofield Consultants, an IT specialist which has
formed a partnership with ICL to develop multimedia for retailers, says
getting multimedia systems right requires strong software design and systems
integration skills. 'These must be focused on clearly defined and achievable
goals, so that the return can be measured,' she adds.
Retailers must have a very clear idea of what they want multimedia
technology to do for them, she says, and make sure their system achieves
that. But the technology already exists to enhance both the ease and
excitement of shopping, and is waiting for retailers to use it.

<TEXT>
Lord Young, executive chairman of Cable &amp; Wireless and a former Trade and
Industry Secretary, is to become president of the National Federation of
Enterprise Agencies.
The organisation speaks on behalf of 130 enterprise agencies throughout
England which provide business services to small and medium sized
enterprises.
The agencies are coming under some budgetary pressure as funds supporting
their support services are being diverted into the Single Regeneration
Budget which the government hopes will improve the coherence of its
inner-city regeneration policies.
Michael Heseltine, a successor of Lord Young at the DTI, is keen for the
Enterprise Agencies to integrate with Training and Enterprise Agencies and
Chambers of Commerce into the government's one-stop-shop Business Link
network.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Management: A philosophical approach - A post-graduate
course with a difference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER ASPDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is the glossy prospectus which first suggests that there is something
different going on here. Atmospheric photographs of droplets of water
disturbing a calm surface, shafts of sunlight defining a clearing in a cave,
hazy landscapes, verdant springs; it could be a campaign leaflet from the
Green party or the programme for a performance of Beethoven's Pastoral
Symphony, but surely not the outline for a new post-graduate management
course.
Yet Lancaster University's Master of Philosophy in Critical Management,
launched in April, has a few more surprises up its anything-but-pinstriped
sleeve. The 14 students on the present programme were greeted with a
two-week introductory course on epistemology and the problems of philosophy,
about as far as you can get from the vocational emphasis of most management
degrees.
Slowly, throughout the three-year, part-time course, they will be introduced
to a variety of ethical, cultural and even religious discussions which more
frequently lurk in the corners of university philosophy departments, often
destined to fade into abstraction and irrelevance.
For Jonathan Gosling, co-director of the programme, these issues are too
important to be left to such a fate. 'We were prompted by the conclusion
that at the very heart of management lie all kinds of philosophical and
ethical questions. And we are catering for a demand that is already there -
out of every MBA class of 25, for example, there are always two or three who
want to question what rationality is, and how reasonable it is to assume so
much about it.
It is the 'critical' in the programme's title that best defines its aims.
Julia Davies, the other co-director, says the course aims to go beyond the
'flavour of the month' feeling about much management education.
'A lot of management rhetoric uses an almost religious language to dress up
what is in effect materialistic. The 'market' often takes the place of God,
and by calling people 'customers', they not only feel 'empowered', but they
are made to think they are doing some kind of good. We aim to be critical of
such rhetoric, and determine to what extent it rests on illusions.'
Gosling denies suggestions that the course constitutes an ideological
critique of management - 'we are not out to destroy anything, we believe
good management is critically important to society' - but there is a
hostility in the department to the 'gurufication' which has continued to
dominate the subject's literature.
Robert Chia, a lecturer in the Management School, says fashionable concepts
such as Total Quality Management or zero-based budgeting emerged from
radical approaches to problem-solving. 'But people get hooked on the system
instead of the style of thinking behind it.' He thinks nothing of peppering
his lectures with philosophers such as Jacques Derrida or Roland Barthes,
balanced with anecdotal examples from the business world. 'It strikes a
chord - we manage to cut through the crap of academic pretentiousness. What
I try to show is that abstract ideas are actually not all that abstract.'
Gosling, in the meantime, is confident of the future of courses such as the
Lancaster M Phil. 'It attracts the kind of person who may already have an
MBA, but finds nothing to relate to in something like pure philosophy.'
Current students include the head of organisational development of the
German health insurance company, AOK; a brand manager for Philip Morris in
Japan; and the human resources director of Romania's economic development
agency.
Gosling also feels he and his colleagues have caught something of the
zeitgeist. 'There is less security and more vulnerability around now, which
the traditional MBA, with its assumption of ever-onward, ever-upward, does
little to cater for. We can provide a notion of mortality.'

FT  22 JUL 94 / Management: The search for universal ethics - The launch of
a new set of business principles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An international ethics code - stressing the need for moral values in
business decision making - will be formally launched in Switzerland this
weekend.
The Caux Round Table's seven-point Principles for Business contains nothing
which will surprise enlightened companies. However, it is thought to be the
first time a document of this kind has attracted influential supporters from
Europe, Japan and the US.
Signatories include Ryuzaburo Kaku, chairman of Japan's Canon, John
Charlton, managing director of New York's Chase Manhattan Bank, and a group
of senior executives from the twin cities of Minneapolis/St Paul.
The aim of the CRT initiative is to set 'a world standard against which
business behaviour can be measured', a benchmark which will help more
individual companies devise their own codes. 'We seek to begin a process
that identifies shared values, reconciles differing values, and thereby
develops a shared perspective on business behaviour acceptable to and
honoured by all,' say the authors in their introduction.
CRT, which meets annually in the Swiss village of Caux-sur-Montreux, was
formed in 1986 by Frederik Philips, former President of Philips of
Eindhoven, and Olivier Giscard D'Estaing, vice-chairman of the Insead
business school at Fontainebleau, France, as an attempt to reduce then
escalating trade tensions with Japan. The group is concerned with 'the
development of constructive economic and social relationships between the
participants' countries and with their joint responsibilities towards the
rest of the world'.
The Principles are said to be drawn from two ethical traditions: the
Japanese philosophy of kyosei described by Canon's Kaku as 'living and
working together for the common good of mankind' and 'human dignity' which
refers to the sacredness or value of each person as an end, not simply as a
means to the fulfilment of others' purposes or even majority prescription.
'What we didn't know at the beginning,' explains Neville Cooper, chairman of
the Top Management Partnership, a former executive director of STC and a
founder of the UK's Institute of Business Ethics, 'was whether we could
reconcile the three different approaches. The Americans tend to emphasise
company rather than state responsibility for community affairs, the Japanese
place more importance on the team rather than on the individual, while in
Europe there is a strong tradition of individual rights'.
The CRT document, which owes a debt to The Minnesota Principles, a statement
of business behaviour developed by the Minnesota Centre for corporate
responsibility, comprises seven general principles and a number of
'stakeholder' principles.
It affirms the responsibilities of business towards a range of stakeholders
(for example, customers and employees as well as shareholders) and to the
countries in which they operate. Suppliers and competitors should expect
businesses 'to honour their obligations in a spirit of honesty and
fairness'.
Business behaviour should be governed by a spirit of trust which goes beyond
the letter of the law, while domestic and international rules should be
respected. Other principles require companies to promote 'the progressive
and judicious' liberalisation of trade, 'to protect and, where possible,
improve the environment' and to avoid illicit operations.
Cooper believes the case for corporate ethics is much more widely accepted
than it was seven years ago and reckons, for instance, that one in three
leading UK companies now has its own code. 'People say an ethics code can't
make you ethical but then it's only a tool, just as a hammer doesn't build
you a house.'
He insists that statements of practice are an important way to clear up
ambiguities for the 'junior people' in an organisation.
Copies of the Principles for Business can be obtained from Caux Round Table
Secretariat, Amaliastraat 10, 2514JC The Hague, The Netherlands. Tel: (070)

FT  22 JUL 94 / Management: Lessons for water babies - John Authers looks at
a project which helps schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
North West Water is taking an extremely long-term approach to water
conservation.
It has set up its own fully-fledged 'school' by the shores of Worthington
Lakes, a reservoir near Wigan, to which it invites children from local
primary schools for day-long sessions in the importance of water and its
conservation.
The entire project is funded on a scale which few companies outside the
utilities sector could dream. The impressionable seven-year-olds who attend
are unlikely to waste water again.
The teacher, a water company employee, tells them how much water goes into
an average bath, and then to gasps from the pupils shows them this is 119
litres. They are even more astonished when she demonstrates that a shower
will only use nine litres.
This turns to amazement when they are told that if they are naughty about
the way they brush their teeth and leave the tap running, they could use up
to 18 litres.
In the long term, these lessons, repeated to a different school in the area
each day, should reduce the amount of water which is wasted in the north
west.
While a public relations exercise to a large extent, the company has
resisted the temptation to ram home its brand identity. Its logo is scarcely
visible in its education centre.
Teachers' responses are positive. Pupils have a day out and a valuable
learning experience tied to the national curriculum. As the expense is met
by the company, it is an excellent deal for schools.
North West Water has taken a lead, but all the water companies have launched
big investment programmes since privatisation. They have gone far beyond the
crudest educational links, which provide companies with good publicity in
return for resources and now provide schools with a package which teachers
are happy to use.
Severn Trent Water, which is opening a regional network of educational
centres similar to Worthington Lakes, admits that they are aimed primarily
at solving its image problem. According to Derek Allder, who co-ordinated
the programme: 'Post-privatisation we weren't the most popular of companies.
We were seen as a virtual monopoly. The profitability of the company was
denounced, while our infrastructure investment was ignored.'
It was therefore vital for a company facing this kind of criticism to prove
itself a good corporate citizen. It also needed a way to show people what it
was doing without arousing the ire which glossy commercials might have
provoked.
According to Allder, the company's defence is that it would not feel able to
bring schoolchildren (or adults at visitors' centres) on to their sites
unless they were confident their business would withstand scrutiny. As he
put it, used car dealers are not likely to launch their own education
programme.
Sir Desmond Pitcher, chairman of North West Water, takes a similar view:
'Our business is so bound up with the day-to-day lives of our customers,
that it is vital we are closely involved with the communities which we
serve.
'The education programme allows us to communicate directly to children and
teachers. There is so much misinformation about our industry that this
communication is the most effective way to open people's eyes to the real
issues and challenges we face.'
The newly privatised water companies may each have monopoly status in their
own areas. But their massive spending on educational and community
programmes suggests that they do not feel able to abuse that status. In
their education programmes, they seem to be providing more direct help to
state schools than any UK industry.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Leader urges restoration of pride on the way to power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair accepted the Labour leadership with a powerful speech setting
out his vision for the party and his confidence that it can return to
government at the next general election after nearly two decades out of
office.
With his voice strained by the emotion of the occasion, Mr Blair said John
Smith had shown the British people that public service was 'still an ideal
that can breathe hope into a politics grown weary and cynical'.
Urging the assembled delegates to restore pride to the party, he said the
leadership election proved the party's ability to change with the times.
'There was a time, wasn't there, when such an election would have been
watched with trepidation by our friends and glee by our enemies. Now it is
an advertisement for Labour,' he said.
Mr Blair paid tribute to Mrs Margaret Beckett, the interim leader, Mr John
Prescott, the successful candidate for the deputy leadership, and Mr Neil
Kinnock, the former leader, who had made Labour 'electable once more'.
Mr Blair attacked the government for failing to correct the 'mistakes' of 15
years in government and urged Mr John Major to call an early general
election.
He promised help for all those who could not help themselves, and promised
to create a country with no corner 'where we shield our eyes in shame and
look away because we dare not contemplate what we see'. It was 'time to talk
a new language of social justice, of what is just and unjust, fair and
unfair, right and wrong'.
In a powerful passage he contrasted unemployment, homelessness, the growth
in government by quangos, crime, drugs and poverty with soaring executive
salaries.
But he warned that Britain had to come to terms with change in technology
and work patterns that affected the whole country, not merely the poor and
unemployed.
The party could provide opportunity and security in this world of change,
but only by taking its historic principle of solidarity and community and
applying it afresh.
'It cannot be done by a return to the past, or staying with the failed
policies of the present. It will not be done either by seeing society as
state control, central power or sectional interests,' he said.
This would mean replacing the choice between the crude free market and the
command economy with a partnership between government and industry, creating
a modern welfare system for a nation at work rather than on benefit,
returning power to local government and embracing the European Union. He
said: 'The challenge of the Labour party is not just to govern, but to
inspire; not just to show how politics matters to us, but what it can do for
them.'

FT  22 JUL 94 / NHS funds 5% of private admissions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Health authorities and GP fundholders have made little use of their freedom
under the government's health reforms to send patients to independent
hospitals, a study of the private sector shows today.
The annual Laing's Review of Private Healthcare shows that in 1992-93 only
4.9 per cent of private hospital admissions were funded by the National
Health Service.
By contrast, some independent providers are facing growing competition from
private wings of NHS hospitals. The review shows that the NHS share of the
private market grew from 11.2 per cent in 1988 to 13.4 per cent in 1993.
More than 70 per cent of private treatment is funded by medical insurance.
In December 1993 6.68m people were covered by insurance - about the same
number as in 1990 - but the review expects growth to resume as recession
ends.
The value of medical insurance premiums reached an estimated Pounds 1.56bn
last year, with payments by insurers to private healthcare providers around
Pounds 1.25bn. The British Medical Association yesterday urged the
government to reconsider proposals to introduce local pay bargaining for
medical staff.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Training cuts 'cause destitution'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thousands of vulnerable young people leaving school this week will become
unemployed and destitute because of government pressure on Youth Training
schemes, says the Children's Society.
A report published by the charity yesterday examines what happens to young
people with special training needs when they are placed on what the society
believes are inappropriate training schemes.
Many special-needs training schemes, often run by charities, are closing or
facing closure as the government squeezes funds for YT and Training for
Work, a programme for unemployed adults. Special-needs schemes are generally
more expensive than mainstream ones.
The report is based on the experiences of young people from one of the
society's special training projects in Nottingham. It said the project
provided successful training and support for school leavers with learning,
emotional and behavioural problems.
Funding cuts imposed by Greater Nottingham Training and Enterprise Council
forced the project to close last year. Its users were moved to mainstream YT
schemes which the society said were unable to cope with the young people's
special needs.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Labour's tragedy turns to triumph
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour's leaders - or most of them - were smiling broadly yesterday, and not
just because Mr Tony Blair won the contest to succeed John Smith by a
convincing margin.
The leadership election could have been a disaster. John Smith's death in
May forced the party to embark on an unplanned contest using an untried
system.
In the end the party survived six weeks of campaigning without an outbreak
of factional fighting and managed to present a civilised and modern image in
the process.
One senior party figure said yesterday: 'Who would have thought 10 weeks ago
that we would handle it like this. I was really afraid it would all go
wrong.'
It was not a great democratic exercise. The distorted electoral system, in
which an MP's vote was worth more than a dozen times a trade union
supporter's vote, made that impossible.
But even political opponents concede in private that it was the biggest
consultative exercise ever undertaken by a British political party.
There were 952,109 votes cast in the three-part electoral college - 327 by
MPs and MEPs, 172,356 by party members in the constituencies and 779,426 by
supporters in affiliated trade unions and socialist societies.
The aggregate total was impressive. As Mr Blair was quick to point out at
yesterday's meeting, Mr John Major was elected leader of the Conservative
party by 154 MPs.
But a more detailed breakdown of the voting by sectors suggests a disturbing
disparity between the three sectors of the electoral college.
Of the 333 MPs and MEPs only four failed to vote, discounting the Speaker,
who traditionally abstains from party matters.
There was a 69.1 per cent turnout of constituency members, but only 19.5 per
cent of union members participated, cutting the overall turnout to 21.1 per
cent of the 4.5m eligible voters.
The low turnout among affiliated organisations suggests that union members
have little collective interest in the leadership of the political wing of
the Labour movement.
It also underlines the question mark over the political influence of trade
union leaders that appeared when Mr Smith ended the block vote at last
year's Labour conference.
Further change to the electoral system is unlikely in the short term. Labour
leaders say party members are sick of organisational change.
Meanwhile, perhaps the best news for the party was that Mr Blair won a
majority in all three sections of the college - 60 per cent among MPs and
MEPs, 58 per cent among constituency members, and 52 per cent among union
voters.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, the interim leader, polled poorly in all three,
beating Mr John Prescott, the shadow employment secretary, by 19.9 per cent
to 19.6 per cent in the MP sections, but losing by 24 per cent to 17 per
cent among party members and 28 per cent to 19 per cent among union
supporters.
In the deputy leadership race Mrs Beckett polled between 40 per cent and 46
per cent in the college, giving Mr Prescott a healthy margin in all three
sections, and an overall lead of 56.5 per cent to 43.5 per cent.
Mrs Beckett behaved with quiet dignity in defeat at the leadership
convention yesterday, but few delegates appeared surprised by her lacklustre
performance.
She started the race with the advantage of holding the interim leadership.
But her decision to contest both leadership posts was a strategic blunder
which left her campaign divided between two objectives.
There was little policy focus either in a campaign which started with a
clarion call to the left, and ended with a call for unity and the inclusion
of all wings of the party.
Mr Prescott, by contrast, focused on the single idea of full employment, and
campaigned mainly for the deputy leader's job. His campaign managers say he
started behind Mrs Beckett, but gradually overtook her during the campaign.
At least a dozen MPs switched sides during the campaign.
Mrs Beckett, who lost her positions on the shadow cabinet and Labour's
national executive committee when the result was announced, will stand for
both at the next round of elections in the autumn, and is certain to
succeed.
Mr Blair has ruled out a shadow-cabinet reshuffle until after the elections,
but Mrs Beckett is regarded as a strong candidate for a high-profile job
such as home affairs, which Mr Blair will vacate.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Hanley condemns Blair for being 'all style, no substance'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jeremy Hanley, the Conservative party's new chairman, was quick to
describe Mr Blair yesterday as 'all style and no substance'.
Mr Hanley said in a robust attack that the new Labour leader had been
elected 'for his looks, not for his policies' and that he had 'failed to
produce any positive reasons for voting Labour'.
He added: 'Wherever he goes, he will not make progress weighed down with the
baggage of Labour's out-of-date and unwanted policies. Whoever is their
leader, Labour is the traditional party of high taxation.'
Some Tory backbenchers frankly admitted that Mr Blair would pose a
substantial new threat to them. One said: 'He is an effective communicator
whom we will have to watch very carefully.'
But another backbencher suggested that Mr John Prescott might have made a
more effective leader, appealing more directly to Labour's core voters. 'I
have sat next to Prescott on Commons committees and he is very effective
indeed,' he said. The Liberal Democrats were generous in their response. Mr
Malcolm Bruce, the party's new Treasury spokesman, said he welcomed Mr Blair
because 'Britain desperately needs good leadership'.
But he added: 'There is much work to be done before Labour can claim to be a
modern political party. There is no point in having an economic programme
unless it is clearly costed.'
Mr Alex Salmond, leader of the Scottish National Party, said that Mr Blair
had ignored Scotland in his acceptance speech.
Referring to what he called Labour's 'commitment' to set up a Scottish
parliament, Mr Salmond said: 'It would seem extraordinary, if devolution is
to be an important plank in his policy programme, that our entire nation
should be omitted from such a comprehensive address.' Commenting in similar
vein, Mr Dafydd Wigley, president of Plaid Cymru, complained that Mr Blair's
omission of any commitment to self-government showed Labour was 'turning
away from Wales and Scotland in a bid to win votes in the south-east of
England'.

It is also to offer 120 Spennymoor employees on nine-month-a-year contracts
permanent, full-year jobs.
Under the restructuring, announced early this year, the company is shutting
its plant at Limburg, near Frankfurt, which employs 480 people, and

FT  22 JUL 94 / 'Millions' needed to replace Swans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lobbying to secure a new multi-million pound regeneration package for
Tyneside in the wake of the probable closure of shipbuilder Swan Hunter
begins today, Chris Tighe writes.
Chief executives and leaders of North Tyneside, South Tyneside and Newcastle
councils, the areas where most past and present Swan Hunter employees live,
are to meet Ms Pamela Denham, the director of the government office for
north-east England.
They will stress that substantial new funds are needed to help the local
economy recover from the loss of shipyard jobs and the knock-on effect on
other businesses.
Mr John Foster, executive director of North Tyneside council, said: 'We are
talking tens of millions of pounds as a replacement package.'
The local authorities are anxious to ensure that the government offers
additional funds and does not divert money from existing programmes in the
region. Later today they will meet receiver Price Waterhouse to discuss its
plans for disposal of assets should Swan Hunter close.
Earlier this week the yard, which is in receivership, lost the refit of the
landing ship Sir Bedivere to Rosyth.
French-based Construction Mecaniques de Normandie, the only prospective
buyer for Swans as a going concern, has said it will only go ahead if the
government offers two years' work. Mr Steve Byers, MP for Wallsend,
yesterday wrote to Mr Roger Freeman, the new defence procurement minister,
asking him to meet CMN.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Gurus assess the master of soundbite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair, say his close associates, is naturally telegenic - a quality
referred to frequently during his leadership campaign. While they deny he
has been tutored by the image consultants, the style counsellors themselves
have been watching his every move.
Ms Mary Spillane, European managing director of CMB Image Consultants, gives
Mr Blair high overall marks for presentation, although there are one or two
areas where he needs to brush up.
First, the plus points. Mr Blair is good at direct eye contact and has
'nice, friendly facial expressions,' she said.
Then there are several points which are also good and set him apart from
other politicians. For example, he does not have a double chin. 'He looks
fit and alive and young and vibrant,' said Ms Spillane.
He wears clothes that 'aren't an issue'. They are modern enough not to look
boring, she said, 'but they're not 'look at me, I'm a wild, crazy young
guy'.' The ties 'aren't full of too much personality. They don't take over
the interview.' She thinks Labour fell into the dazzling tie trap during the
last election campaign.
His appeal to women is not too overt. 'There's a twinkle in Blair's eye that
is flirtatious. However, he doesn't play that card so offensively that it
turns off your average macho bloke down the pub,' she added.
What she would like Mr Blair to do is get his teeth fixed - not serious
orthodontic work but some judicious filing to straighten them up.
He needs to 'clean up the hair between his eyebrows - he looks a little
grubby there,' and get his hair restyled to 'frame his face a bit better'.
His voice is good, although he can start to sound strident when he gets
excited.
Officials at Conservative Central Office have also been scrutinising Mr
Blair's performance. They see two clear weaknesses which they aim to
exploit.
First, Mr Blair is acknowledged by his opponents as the master of the
soundbite, giving him a clear advantage when it comes to the early evening
news bulletins. But they consider he will show a weakness on detail in
longer interviews and in sustained debate.
Second, his youth is seen as a double-edged sword. Certainly his opponents
recognise his vigour - but say he also looks a bit wet behind the ears. His
associates acknowledge the problem but say nature, exposure and the demands
of the job will take their toll. 'If he looks young and fresh now, in a
year's time he won't'

FT  22 JUL 94 / Shortages push construction pay 'above 1980s levels'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Poaching of experienced construction executives has re-emerged as shortages
of skilled staff have pushed salaries of site managers, engineers and
surveyors higher than at the peak of the late-1980s development boom,
according to the industry's biggest recruitment agency.
Wages of bricklayers, carpenters and plant operators, have also risen
sharply in recent months. Meanwhile, building material prices have increased
by more than twice the rate of general inflation in the past year, a report
will say today.
The shadows of wage and material price inflation, which are threatening to
undermine Britain's economic recovery and force interest rates higher, can
be clearly seen over one of its biggest industries.
More than 500,000 jobs are estimated to have disappeared from the
construction industry since 1989. The loss of large numbers of managers and
tradesmen and women has left the industry with a shortage of experienced
workers as demand for construction has increased.
Employees, who 18 months ago were worrying whether they would have a job at
all, are suddenly finding they can negotiate higher salaries for the first
time in five years.
The biggest demand has come from private-sector housebuilders. Montrose
Construction Services, a recruitment agency which has filled more than
18,000 jobs in the industry in the past 12 months, said there had been surge
in refurbishment, maintenance and improvement work.
Miss Sara Reitze, its major accounts manager, said: 'Housebuilders are
starting many more development sites. They need lots of people quickly, not
just to manage new sites, but to replace existing staff which may have left
to join rivals for more money.'
Miss Reitze said a housing development site manager in south east England
could expect to earn Pounds 20,000 to Pounds 23,000 a year, with a car or
car allowance. The same person, a year ago, would have earned Pounds 18,000
to Pounds 20,000 with a car. Montrose said even at the peak, a site manager
would have earned no more than Pounds 20,000 a year.
Salaries of contracts managers, quantity surveyors and site engineers also
have risen to above previous peak levels.
Mr Robert Smith, Montrose managing director, said: 'Companies want to
recruit managers in their mid-20s to early 30s with previous recent
experience. The recession has meant that there are very few of these
available.
'Those who have left the industry have taken early retirement, found new
careers, or their treatment has left them chary about coming back. The lack
of training in recent years is another big problem,' he said.
Skilled workers are in short supply, particularly in London and south-east
England, where the resurgence in construction activity has been greatest. Mr
Smith said: 'There are estimated to be about 1,500 to 2,000 British
bricklayers working in Germany at the moment, earning up to Pounds 1,000 a
week.'
Bricklayers in London are earning about Pounds 65 to Pounds 70 a day,
compared with Pounds 50 at the end of last year. Carpenters' wages have
risen from about Pounds 50 a day last year to about Pounds 60 while earnings
of basic plant operators, diggers, lift truck operators and loaders have
increased from Pounds 45 to Pounds 60 a day.
Mr Simon Stewart, the agency's London labour manager, said: 'There have been
very few apprenticeships in the past few years, making matters worse. In the
past month Irish construction workers have begun to reappear in London for
the first time in several years.'
Montrose said wage rates had risen by similar amounts in the Midlands and
had started to rise in the north of England.
A report by EC Harris, international construction cost consultants, will
show today that building materials producers have taken advantage of
shortages to improve prices and recover some of the ground they lost during
the recession.
It estimates that materials prices rose by 6 per cent on average in the 12
months to the end of April - more than twice the rise in the retail prices
index over the same period.
Prices of structural steel and plasterboard have risen on average by 10 per
cent. Other products whose prices are up more than 6 per cent include
bricks, concrete roof tiles and blocks, clay pipes and cement.
Rises in labour and material costs, and even bigger increases in housing
land prices, have yet to be reflected in the price of completed buildings.
EC Harris says new house prices rose only a few percentage points while
construction contract tender prices rose only 3 per cent in the 12 months to
the end of April - half the rate of materials price rises.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Foreign groups create record total of jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Overseas companies created a record 28,727 jobs in the UK last year through
inward investment projects and helped safeguard a further 67,372 jobs, Mr
Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said yesterday.
The new jobs total is up 40 per cent on 1992-93, while the number of inward
investment projects - new or expanded operations and acquisitions - rose 25
per cent to a record 404, the annual report of the Invest in Britain Bureau
shows.
The report was viewed by the government as further confirmation that the UK
continues to welcome more overseas companies than any other European country
in spite of increasing competition from the rest of the European Union.
Mr Heseltine said: 'These are tremendous figures. Thousands of people are at
work today because of our success at attracting inward investment. But we
will not rest on our laurels. We will need to keep on fighting for every
project.'
The number of jobs created or safeguarded by inward investment was 96,099,
up sharply from 59,271 in the previous year. But officials pointed out that
about 30,000 of the 67,372 saved jobs were linked to BMW's takeover of
Rover.
The report says foreign-owned enterprises account for 17 per cent of all UK
manufacturing jobs, 23 per cent of net output and 33 per cent of net capital
spending.
Among new investments last year was the Pounds 15m spent by Fujitsu Fulcrum
Communications, which makes fibre-optic transmission equipment, on a
European headquarters at Birmingham Business Park. There was also Pounds
3.5m spent on a European headquarters at Gillingham Business Park, Kent, for
Hochiki, a Japanese producer of fire-detection systems.
Nearly half - 183 - of the 404 investment projects, were made by US
companies, up from 126 in the previous year. Investments by German companies
slipped from 51 to 45, while Japanese projects rose from 21 to 30.
The bureau said that of the new jobs, 19,834 were created from 299 projects
in manufacturing - a reflection of the near 40 per cent rise in
manufacturing productivity since 1985.
The latest results were presented yesterday by Mr Andrew Fraser, who took
over as the bureau's chief executive on July 4 after a career spent mainly
in advertising. The appointment was one of a series of initiatives being
taken by Mr Heseltine to reinforce the inward investment effort.
Mr Fraser said all regions of the UK had benefited from inward investment
last year, with many different industry sectors. He said foreign companies
knew that the UK was a good place from which to do business and to take
advantage of the market offered by 370m consumers in the European Economic
Area.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Rifkind defends forces budget cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, insisted yesterday that cuts he
announced last week would not affect the fighting strength of UK forces,
which would still be capable of mounting a campaign similar to that in the
Falklands war.
Appearing before the Commons defence committee, Mr Rifkind denied that the
cuts put the Treasury first. He said that in addition to the Pounds 750m a
year of cuts which would go to the Treasury in 1997, about Pounds 100m of
extra savings had been identified which would go to the forces. About Pounds
60m is to be spent on a joint-service rapid reaction command centre to
co-ordinate activity between groups such as the para-chute brigade and the
Royal Marines.
Mr Nicholas Bonsor, chairman of the committee, said that little of the
Pounds 3bn of equipment ordered last week came as a result of savings. Mr
Rifkind replied that had the savings not been made, some of the programmes
would have been in jeopardy.
Sir Nicholas Fairbairn asked whether the cuts in support meant that the
forces had been inefficient before or were being cut back now. Mr Rifkind
said the time taken to conduct the study meant new and more efficient ways
had been found to manage tasks.
He said that it cost up to Pounds 15,000 to enlist each serviceman, but
using Jobcentres instead of recruiting offices meant the same job could be
done at much lower cost.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Howard 'acted unconstitutionally'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, was accused in the Lords of acting
unconstitutionally when he 'misused' a discretionary power enabling him to
set the starting date for a compensation scheme for victims of criminal
injuries.
Lord Simon of Glaisdale said that Mr Howard had chosen to interpret the
discretionary power as entitling him not to bring in the scheme at all, and
to substitute a non-statutory scheme.
Mr Howard had flown in the face of parliament's clear indication that it
wanted a statutory scheme, he said.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Economy forecast to grow by 3.1%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Oxford Economic Forecasting, the independent analysts, expects UK growth to
accelerate to 3.1 per cent next year from a forecast 2.8 per cent in 1994.
However, it expects the recovery to lose momentum and growth to be 2.7 per
cent in 1996 and 2.2 per cent in 1997.
The world economy is forecast to expand by more than 4 per cent this year,
almost double last year's rate, with growth rising to about 4.4 per cent in
1995.
The forecast reflects expectations of strong growth in the developing
countries, led by China. Europe's economic outlook has also improved,
according to the survey, reflecting stronger than anticipated exports and
business confidence so far this year.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Council workers to decide on offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unions representing local-government workers yesterday took a stand-off
position towards a pay offer said to be worth 4.3 per cent to their 1.5m
white-collar and manual members, Lisa Wood writes.
Workers including school caretakers, secretaries and refuse collectors will
now be asked by Unison, the public-services union, and the TGWU and GMB
general unions what action they want to take.
The offer from the Local Government Management Board, which represents
councils in England and Wales, was improved yesterday. It proposes a
two-stage increase - over 19 months for manual workers and over 21 months
for white-collar workers - with 2.3 per cent followed by a further 2 per
cent. It includes a flat-rate rise of Pounds 75 a year.
Unison, which publicly took a more aggressive attitude towards the offer
than the other unions, said it could not recommend the offer to its members.
It did not say, however, that it rejected the offer.
The deal would add Pounds 535m to local authorities' pay bills in England
and Wales.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Rethink over rail repairs sell-off urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Civil engineering contractors are urging the government to rethink plans to
privatise companies which carry out Pounds 1bn worth of maintenance and
track renewal work for the railways.
The Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors, which represents 300 of the
biggest companies in the sector, said yesterday that it wanted the
government to break up British Rail's infrastructure services division into
smaller units.
Mr Maurice Webb, industry director of the federation, said the maintenance
companies that were to be put up for sale had contracts worth between Pounds
80m and Pounds 120m a year so could only be bought by a few of the biggest
contractors.
The federation is pressing for them to be broken up into smaller units
starting at Pounds 50m of contract value to enable smaller contractors to
bid. It fears that the present proposal will lead to the transport
construction sector being dominated by a small number of very big companies.
Mr Webb said: 'At present the number of companies which could bid would be
limited to the top 10 or 12 contractors.' Most of these are federation
members but Mr Webb said the federation was acting for the smaller and
medium-size companies.
The federation held a preliminary meeting with Mr Roger Freeman, then
transport minister, on Wednesday, the day he was moved to the Ministry of
Defence. It hoped for a further meeting with Mr John Watts, his successor.
The Department of Transport said there were no plans to alter the present
arrangements for privatising BR's infrastructure activities.
The federation is also concerned about the government's plan to split
maintenance work from track-renewal contracts when it privatises the
infrastructure companies. It wants bidders to be allowed to buy companies
which carry out both maintenance and track renewal. One reason is that while
maintenance contracts normally provide steady year-round work, track renewal
work is less predictable. Bidders would like a balance of both types of work
to make more efficient use of employees and equipment.
The track renewal companies are smaller than the maintenance companies and
have annual contracts valued at between Pounds 25m and Pounds 40m.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Opencast mines get stricter standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government said yesterday it was setting stricter environmental
standards for opencast coal mining as it published new planning guidance for
the industry.
Environmental campaigners welcomed what they saw as improvements on existing
guidance, in particular the removal of a statement that opencast was in the
'national interest'.
But the Council for the Protection of Rural England said important areas of
the countryside were still at risk from opencast devastation. It objected to
what it saw as the guidance's implication that opencast did not affect land
permanently.
The council and the Coalfield Communities Campaign said the full
implications of the fine print in the guidance would not be known until
tested in practice in the wake of coal privatisation later this year.
Mr David Curry, environment minister, said the guidance, which replaces a
1988 document, will give mineral planning authorities a framework to help
strike a balance between the economic importance of coal and the protection
of the environment.
Mr Stephen Fothergill, Coalfield Communities Campaign director, said
opencast mining was potentially one of the most damaging land uses.
He said: 'Local authorities fail to see why the government has for so long
been reluctant to rein back opencast coalmining when there is so obviously a
glut of coal on the market and when so many fine collieries are being
closed.'
The campaign believes the removal of the 'national interest' phrase from the
guidance is significant, however. Its inclusion in the 1988 guidance had
'made it easier to overrule local objections to opencasting at planning
inquiries than to overturn objections to any other form of development going
through the planning system'.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Granada Group to cut jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Granada Group yesterday moved to integrate the non-programme making
activities of Granada Television and London Weekend Television with the loss
of between 150 and 200 jobs from a combined staff of 2,000.
The integration plan, drawn up following Granada's hostile takeover of LWT,
was announced yesterday by Mr Charles Allen, chief executive of both ITV
companies.
Joint operations to provide finance, transmission, press and publicity
services across the companies will be created. There will also be a single
broadcasting unit to implement broadcasting strategy across the companies.
The companies will maintain their own programme production and technical
services 'in recognition of the uniquely successful programme-making culture
at each company'.
A new sales organisation, Laser, will sell the airtime of Granada, LWT,
Yorkshire, Tyne Tees and Border.
Mr Steve Morrison, managing director of Granada Television, becomes managing
director of LWT and Mr Mike Southgate, managing director of LWT's facilities
operation, The London Studios, becomes deputy managing director of LWT.
Ms Andrea Wonfor, director of programmes at Granada, and Mr Jules Burns,
director of programmes and management services there, become joint managing
directors of the company.
Mr Robin Paxton, LWT's managing director of broadcasting, is to leave the
company.
Mr Allen said the company had put the programme making businesses at the
heart of plans for growth. 'These changes will strengthen our competitive
position,' he said.

Legislation will be introduced in the next finance bill and is intended to
become effective next April, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, told the
Commons yesterday.
A requirement for companies to pay National Insurance contributions on the
private benefit an employee enjoys from a company car was introduced for the
first time in the current fiscal year, together with a simplified company
car taxation regime.
However, some companies are considered by the Inland Revenue to have been
using a 1969 legal judgment, Heaton v Bell, to avoid paying such
contributions and in some cases to secure reduced tax charges. Under the
1969 judgment, where the benefit of a company car is freely convertible into
cash, the cash benefit is taxable under general income tax rules rather than
the special provisions for company cars.
In these circumstances, the employee pays tax on the cash he or she could
get and the employer does not pay national insurance contributions.
However, the Inland Revenue contends that some employers are making
arrangements designed to bring company cars within the terms of this
judgment even though the cash option is not taken up.
Mr Clarke also announced a change to the Payments on Account Scheme for
value added tax which may affect companies with VAT liabilities of about
Pounds 1.6m. Under the scheme, companies are assessed annually - on their
last 'prescribed' accounting period up to May 31 1993. Those with annual
liabilities above Pounds 1.6m pay VAT on a monthly basis, those below the
threshold, quarterly.
In order to avoid timing difficulties brought about by the move to a
November Budget, the current scheme is being extended from 12 months to 18
months ending in March 1995.
The move means that companies where sales are falling, which would otherwise
have started paying quarterly from October, will continue paying monthly.
Similarly, those companies that would have started paying monthly in October
will continue paying quarterly until March 1995.
In addition, non-domestic buildings converted into housing are now exempt
from VAT.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Ministers face curbs at Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ministers will have to divest themselves of direct investment in Lloyd's
insurance market under new rules announced yesterday.
From next year ministers who are underwriting members of Lloyd's will have
to arrange their syndicate participation through a member's agent pooling
arrangement (MAPA) - equivalent to a unit trust.
The revised government procedures - disclosed by Mr John Major in a written
answer to Mr Jacques Arnold, Conservative MP for Gravesham - follows
criticism of Tory MPs' involvement in Lloyd's.
The cross-party committee on MPs' interests recently issued a strong rebuke
to 11 Conservative MPs, including former prime minister Sir Edward Heath,
for failing to declare full details of their Lloyd's involvement.
Government officials believe the new procedures will have the effect of
reducing ministers' exposure to over or under-performance by any one
syndicate. An MAPA must consist of at least 30 syndicates and have no more
than 7.5 per cent of its total capacity in any one. Although MAPA members
will still be subject to unlimited liability, officials say ministers are
less likely to face huge losses and will no longer be directly involved in
Lloyd's investment. Under the old rules ministers could suspend their
underwriting selectively.
The prime minister, chancellor and secretary for trade and industry are not
allowed to be underwriting members.
Mr Peter Hain, Labour MP for Neath, yesterday criticised the new rules for
failing to address the question of whether MPs who were Lloyd's members, and
senior insiders at the insurance organisation, were given preferential
treatment. He has written to the prime minister explaining his allegations
and renewing his call for a public inquiry.
He said it was 'extraordinary' that none of the 51 Tory MPs with combined
losses of more than Pounds 22m had faced bankruptcy. 'This suggests that at
least some MPs, including members of the government, have had special
protection not accorded to other Lloyd's Names,' he said.
The total losses suffered by Lloyd's 30,000 Names, or individual backers,
have totalled Pounds 7.5bn in the four years to 1991, the last year for
which accounts are available.

FT  22 JUL 94 / D-Day events boost tourism earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This summer's D-Day commemoration may have increased Britain's tourism
earnings from North America by as much as Pounds 73m, according to Mr Iain
Sproat, national heritage minister.
He said in a Commons written answer that early indications suggested the
event had attracted between 75,000 and 125,000 extra North American visitors
to the UK.
This had increased the country's earnings from tourism by 'between Pounds
44m and Pounds 73m', he said.
Both the number of visitors and the amount of visitor spending were
'substantially' higher than forecast.
Earlier this year, Mr John Major was forced to defuse an embarrassing row
over the nature of the 50th anniversary commemoration by bowing to veterans'
demands for a bigger say in the events. There had been widespread criticism
of the national heritage department's handling of the anniversary.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Inquiry on MPs' interests begins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A top-level Commons inquiry which could lead to far-reaching changes in the
rules governing MPs' outside interests got under way at Westminster
yesterday as MPs packed their bags for the summer recess.
The powerful committee of privileges met privately for about an hour in a
discreet Commons committee room.
The meeting came less than 24 hours after Labour backbenchers were refused
their request that the inquiry into the so-called 'cash for questions'
affair be conducted by MPs with no outside business interests.
The committee is understood not to have agreed formal terms of reference for
its investigation but a number of MPs on it are expected to press for all
the areas outlined in a recent statement by Miss Betty Boothroyd, the
Speaker, to be included.
Miss Boothroyd, referring to a warning by another committee of MPs that 'a
financial inducement to take a particular course of action in parliament may
constitute a bribe', said there was 'an urgent need to clarify the law of
parliament' in some areas.
She said the committee, which would be chaired by Mr Tony Newton, the
Commons leader, would have the power to inquire 'not only into the matter of
the particular complaint, but also into facts surrounding and reasonably
connected with it, and into the principles of the law and custom of
privilege that are concerned'.
The inquiry arises from the action of two Conservative MPs - Mr Graham
Riddick and Mr David Tredinnick - who agreed to accept payments of Pounds
1,000 to table parliamentary questions.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Portillo expected to toughen language of employment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Portillo, the new employment secretary, will represent a big
shift in rhetoric on labour-market policy but may have little room for new
policy initiatives, according to Whitehall officials and political
colleagues.
Mr Ira Chalphin, employment policy director at the Institute of Directors,
welcomed his promotion and said he believed that Mr Portillo would be more
interested than Mr David Hunt, his predecessor, in another round of union
legislation.
The rightwing agenda for further reform of industrial relations includes the
banning of strikes in essential services, the removal of unions from
official positions in bodies such as the Health and Safety Commission and
Acas, the conciliation service, the privatisation of the conciliation
function and the rationalisation of the industrial tribunal system.
Many directors of the employer-led training and enterprise councils view Mr
Portillo's arrival with trepidation. The Pounds 2bn which the Tecs spend on
training, with the Pounds 1bn spent by the Employment Service agency on
active labour-market measures, are the two main expenditure items of the
department.
One official said: 'He looks at any large expenditure items very closely,
and he seems to hold the Treasury view that much of the spend-ing on
training does not represent good value for money.'
However, the two main policy initiatives bequeathed by Mr Hunt - the
Jobseeker's Allowance and the modern apprenticeship scheme - are unlikely to
be substantially changed by Mr Portillo.
At the Treasury he has already been involved in the formulation of the
Jobseeker's Allowance, which tightens the conditions for receiving benefit
and shifts the emphasis from passive welfare to active job-seeking.
He is likely to be more politically aggressive than Mr Hunt on European
issues, Labour party policies such as the minimum wage, and the idea of
social partnership.
Mr Hunt, although a disappointment to many union leaders, did use the
language of dialogue and was happy to hold regular discussions. That is
unlikely to continue with Mr Portillo. Mr John Monks, general secretary of
the Trades Union Congress, said: 'We will take him as we find him.'
His first big test on European issues could come this month when Mr Padraig
Flynn, the European Union social affairs commissioner, unveils his white
paper on social policy. This is expected to lead to a new programme of
social directives.
One official said: 'He is not likely to have a big policy impact but he will
use the position, rather as Norman Tebbit did, as a political platform to
make general points about economic incentives and the virtues of
individualism.'

FT  22 JUL 94 / Tories tot up winners and losers after reshuffle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Day One Mr John Major's reshuffle was hailed as a delicate balancing act
that could unite the Conservative party. But yesterday MPs from the left and
right wings were already using it to continue their long-running feud.
As ministers assembled in Downing Street for the first meeting of the new
cabinet, several Tory MPs complained that their wing of the party had not
won a clear victory in the reshuffle.
The small group of Euro-sceptic Tories were particularly disappointed that
none of their number had been given a government post at a time when the
prime minister is himself taking a more sceptical line on Europe.
The new party chairman, Mr Jeremy Hanley, a pro-European with liberal views,
was criticised by rightwingers for being 'soft' on public spending and
nuclear disarmament as well as on more personal grounds.
One rightwinger said: 'He may be very good at raising morale at
rubber-chicken Tory dinners but he does not have the sharp brain needed for
national TV appearances.'
The anti-federalist European Foundation - run by Mr Bill Cash, the
Euro-sceptic MP - was also critical of some of Mr Hanley's more pro-European
views. One said: 'We will be asking Mr Hanley whether he will accept and
reflect the sceptical party line over Europe.'
Mr Michael Portillo's appointment as employment secretary was the source of
concern to left-of-centre Tory MPs, with some arguing that the job would
give him a strong platform from which to pursue his rightwing agenda.
One prominent backbencher expressed concern that the prime minister had
given Mr Portillo one of the three main economic portfolios in the cabinet.
Another Tory leftwinger feared that there would be so little for Mr Portillo
to do at employment - a department whose future had been regarded by some as
under threat - that he would have more time to pursue his own rightwing
agenda.
Meanwhile, some cabinet ministers were working hard to introduce policy
changes in their new departments, un-encumbered by sniping from colleagues.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the new education secretary, appeared to be taking
particularly active steps to initiate a rapprochement with teaching unions
after two years of strained relations under Mr John Patten, her predecessor.
Officials at Mrs Shephard's department were telephoning a wide variety of
teaching organisations, including the National Association of Head Teachers,
to arrange meetings over the summer.
Secretaries of state at two other departments - social security and
transport - were urgently working out which responsibilities would be
assigned to junior ministers.
Dr Brian Mawhinney, the new transport secretary, was also considering how to
divide responsibilities in a department which has lost a ministerial post in
the reshuffle.
One of the three junior ministers is to take overall policy responsibility
for rail and road infrastructure, ports, airports and urban transport. A
second minister will take charge of services provided by railways, as well
as road haulage. The third will take control of environmental and safety
issues.
Mr William Hague, one of the social security department's two new ministers
of state, will be in charge of disablement issues.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Mainland ban on Adams 'unlawful'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, was unlawfully banned from the British
mainland to prevent him embarrassing the government by revealing to MPs the
existence of secret talks over Northern Ireland, the High Court heard
yesterday.
The allegation came as lawyers for Mr Adams asked two judges to declare that
the exclusion order made last October under the Prevention of Terrorism
(Temporary Provisions) Act 1989 breached both European and domestic law.
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, refused to revoke the order in January.
The challenge drew protests from campaigners who accused Mr Adams of
hypocrisy in seeking to use British law to establish his civil rights, while
terrorists denied those rights to others.
Mr Robin Allen, for Mr Adams, said the ban coincided with an invitation to
the Sinn Fein leader from Mr Tony Benn, the Labour MP, to visit parliament
to discuss the political situation in Ulster with MPs.
It prevented him from attending at a time when he might have disclosed the
existence of then secret talks between Sinn Fein and the government.
Mr Allen told Lord Justice Steyn and Mr Justice Kay: 'The government could
have been, or could be, brought down if it were to lose the support of
Unionist MPs.'
He claimed Mr Adams was 'a man of peace'.
Mr Adams' rights as a citizen of the European Union to reside and move
freely within the territory of member states was infringed by a misuse of
anti-terrorism laws, he said.
Government officials denied making the order to avoid political
embarrassment and stated its aim was 'the total banishment' of Mr Adams.
Mr Stephen Richards, for the government, is expected to argue at the hearing
tomorrow that the 'secret talks' allegation is implausible since Mr Adams
could have disclosed the existence of the talks at any time.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Car production likely to reach 21-year high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Car production this year is likely to reach a 21-year high if export trends
indicated by industry statistics yesterday are sustained.
Production for export in June, at 48,213, jumped by more than 20 per cent on
a year-on-year basis for the second month in succession, strengthening the
industry's hopes that continental Europe's car market recovery is
accelerating after one of its sharpest recessions on record.
With the UK market already restored to health - record sales are being
forecast for August - the export performance helped lift total car output.
In June it was 145,078, up 7.7 per cent compared with the same month a year
ago.
Industry analysts believe that market conditions in both the UK and on the
Continent should allow production to strengthen further for the remainder of
the year, lifting it well clear of the 1,375,523 cars produced last year -
itself the highest output since 1974.
Increasing economic activity in the UK is also reflected in statistics for
commercial vehicle output. This rose to 21,328 in June, up 27.2 per cent on
a year-on-year basis. Within this total, output for export rose only 9.4 per
cent, to 7,032, while production for the domestic market soared by 38 per
cent to 14,296.
June's performance lifted total car output for the first half of this year
to 751,872. This was only 1.2 per cent higher than in the first half of
1993, a reflection of the continuing recession in the opening months of the
year in continental Europe's markets, and that the UK's market was only just
starting to emerge from recession.
Production for export in the year's first half, at 292,699, was 1.8 per cent
higher than a year ago, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders and the Central Statistical Office.
The UK industry's performance is boosted by the rapid increase in production
by Toyota and Honda, whose UK plants went on stream at the beginning of last
year.
Commercial vehicle output in the first half of the year reached 116,627, a
10.2 per cent rise on a year ago.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Sinn Fein response 'wins IRA backing'
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The IRA military leadership has apparently endorsed proposals to be put to a
special delegate conference of its political wing Sinn Fein this weekend.
The party's definitive response to the Downing Street declaration is to be
made at the conference, to be held on this Sunday.
Meanwhile Mr Albert Reynolds, Irish prime minister, said last night that his
government 'would not just wait for peace', but would continue efforts to
find a solution. He told Fianna Fail party supporters: 'This government will
continue to work actively by whatever means are available to bring it about.
'That is why for many months we have been pursuing with the British
government, in parallel with the peace process and drawing from it,
agreement on a framework for a Northern settlement - a framework we hope to
agree by the early autumn.'
In yesterday's An Phoblacht, Sinn Fein's weekly newspaper, the IRA army
council said: 'We encourage Sinn Fein as it continues to strive for the
creation of a viable peace process.'
The IRA statement appears to be aimed at reassuring the conference that
there is a unity of purpose between the IRA army council and the Sinn Fein
leadership.
The IRA statement said it had 'a vested interest in securing peace' and that
it would maintain 'a positive and flexible attitude to developments in the
peace process'. It reiterated its adherence to 'republican objectives which
include the right to national self-determination'.
Downing Street responded brusquely to yesterday's statement, saying it did
not measure up to a permanent cessation of violence.
The main issue emerging from the conference will be whether there is any
statement or hint that the IRA should suspend its military operations to
allow space for further political developments.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Tap water given seal of approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tap water in England and Wales is good and getting even better, according to
the government inspector.
Mr Michael Rouse, who heads the Drinking Water Inspectorate, said 3.5m
quality tests last year found sub-standard water in only 1.1 per cent of
cases. Each of these was later investigated but none was found to pose a
danger to health.
Mr Rouse criticised the media for putting about 'ill-founded scare stories'
on water pollution. This resulted in people who could ill-afford it buying
expensive bottled water, the quality of which was not monitored as closely
as tap water, he said.
Mr Robert Atkins, the environment minister, has sent a copy of the report to
Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, the European Union environment commissioner, in
Brussels. Mr Atkins said yesterday that the UK was the only EU member state
which produced an independently audited report on drinking water quality. He
urged Mr Paleokrassas to encourage other member states to do the same.
Mr Rouse's report comes as water companies are defending themselves against
criticism of fast-rising charges. Next week Ofwat, the water industry's
economic regulator, is due to announce new 10-year price controls which are
expected to impose tougher limits on future increases.
The water companies were quick to seize on yesterday's report as evidence
that their investment in quality was paying off.
Ms Janet Langdon, director of the Water Services Association, said: 'The
quality of water is at an all-time high. At 26p per day for the average
household the cost of top-quality water is excellent value for money.'
She said, however, that Ofwat could not impose price controls which
prevented the water companies meeting their obligations to provide
high-quality water.
The inspectorate's 250-page report, edited highlights of which are to be
distributed in a free pamphlet, showed that water quality was better on 16
out of 17 counts.
The one exception was polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) which is
deposited in water by the tar used until 1970 to protect the inside of metal
water mains. Mr Rouse said that the water companies had programmes in place
to deal with this.
Lead continued to be a problem, although it was small and resulted mostly
from lead piping in people's homes, for which the water companies were not
responsible.
Another problem area, pesticides, also improved with fewer zones failing to
meet the standards.
Enforcement action was taken against water companies over breaches of
regulations in 213 cases but there were no prosecutions. The decision
whether to take a case to court rests not with the inspectorate but with the
environment secretary.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Trade deficit outside EU cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British exports to countries outside the European Union rose to record
levels in the second quarter of this year, the Central Statistical Office
said yesterday.
The value of exports to non-EU countries between April and June was a
seasonally adjusted Pounds 15.57bn, a rise of 1.5 per cent compared with the
previous three months, and 10 per cent compared with the same period a year
ago.
Exports rose to Pounds 5.27bn in June, from Pounds 5.09bn in May.
This rise in exports, coupled with fairly flat levels of imports,
contributed to a gradual narrowing of the trade deficit with non-EU
countries. The deficit in June was Pounds 0.5bn, down from Pounds 0.67bn in
May.
Analysts pointed out that some of this improvement was due to strong oil
exports and a rebound in the exports of erratics such as ships, aircraft and
silver.
Nevertheless, the underlying trend was also healthy. Measured without oil
and erratics, the deficit fell to Pounds 0.59bn in June. May's underlying
deficit figure was revised down to Pounds 0.6bn, from Pounds 0.67bn.
Mr Richard Needham, trade minister, yesterday welcomed the figures as a sign
that '1994 is a year of consistent success for exporters'.
This cheery prognosis was echoed by the Institute of Export, which called on
British companies to exploit the 'huge opportunities' in China and
South-East Asia.
Exports to North America grew at the fastest rate of the sectors in the
second quarter, rising 6.5 per cent compared with the first quarter, and 15
per cent compared with the second quarter last year.
Exports to the world's other leading industrialised countries in the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development grew by 6 per cent in
the three months to June, quarter on quarter.
But although the export figures were yesterday greeted with pleasure in the
City, analysts expressed some confusion about the import data.
Imports in June were broadly flat on the month, running at Pounds 5.76bn.
But this concealed a 6 per cent fall in seasonally adjusted import volumes,
quarter on quarter, and a 6 per cent rise in the non-seasonally adjusted
import prices, also quarter on quarter.
Some analysts suggested that this reflected rising world commodity prices.
Raw material costs rose 5 per cent in the second quarter, compared with the
first.
Consequently, analysts suggested, the fall in import volumes might reflect
the fact that higher import prices were encouraging companies to reduce
their imports - or possibly, might reflect a slight slowing in
manufacturing.
However, Mr Adam Cole of James Capel said that discrepancy might reflect
statistical problems, since the price rises were not confined to the raw
materials sector.
Import prices of manufactured goods have risen 10 per cent since January -
far more than any sterling movement in this period.
The CSO said yesterday that it had conducted statistical double checks on
the data, and suggested that one reason for the trend might be that
companies were substituting for cheaper EU or domestic imports.

FT  22 JUL 94 / GPs make 'little use' of freedom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Health authorities and GP fundholders have made little use of their freedom
under the government's health reforms to send patients to independent
hospitals, a study of the private sector shows today.
The annual Laing's Review of Private Healthcare shows that in 1992-93 only
4.9 per cent of private hospital admissions were funded by the National
Health Service.
By contrast, some independent providers are facing growing competition from
private wings of NHS hospitals. The review shows that the NHS's share of the
private market grew from 11.2 per cent in 1988 to 13.4 per cent in 1993.
More than 70 per cent of private treatment is funded by medical insurance.
In December 1993 6.68m people were covered by insurance - about the same
number as in 1990 - but the review expects growth to resume with the end of
the recession and greater price stability in the insurance market.
The value of medical insurance premiums reached an estimated Pounds 1.56bn
in 1993, with payments by insurers to hospitals, doctors and other private
healthcare providers around Pounds 1.25bn.
Mr William Laing, editor of the review, said the figures indicated that
private medical insurance was in a much stronger financial position than two
years ago, with gross margins reaching a 'historically high level' of 20 per
cent in 1993.
The British Medical Association yesterday urged the government to reconsider
proposals to introduce local pay bargaining for medical staff. Mrs Virginia
Bottomley, health secretary, responded that she wanted to proceed with the
changes 'in a manner which can command the confidence of doctors and other
staff'.

FT  22 JUL 94 / World Trade News: A Riviera to replace the razor wire -
Plans for a Jordan-Israel-Egypt tourist triangle on the Gulf of Aqaba
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The mayor of Eilat, Mr Gabi Kadosh, points to architects' plans, aerial
photographs and drawings of multi-million-dollar projects adorning his
office.
There is a polo club, a sports centre, hotels, marinas, artificial lagoons
and a regional tourism university. But the drawing that most inspires Mr
Kadosh is of a residential development around lagoons and canals straddling
the Israeli-Jordanian border, now the site of land mines and coils of razor
wire.
Israelis hope one of the quickest changes to follow the historic summit
between King Hussein of Jordan and Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin in
Washington on Monday will be opening of borders, boosting tourism and trade
and paving the way to regional co-operation and joint planning.
Nobody wants these changes more than the tourism and municipal officials in
Eilat, where there are grand dreams of building a Red Sea tourism triangle
between Eilat, the Jordanian port of Aqaba and the tiny Egyptian resort of
Taba. In their enthusiasm, officials say they envisage a 'Middle East
Riviera' in the desert which will also operate as a free trade zone.
Some of the grandiose projects, such as a desalination plant, may remain on
the drawing board for a long time. But opening the border and funding
limited infrastructure projects is certain to fuel an investment boom in the
Gulf of Aqaba, where Mr Kadosh says Israel and private companies are already
investing Dollars 500m (Pounds 322m) this year in infrastructure, new hotels
and tourist facilities.
Among the most attractive projects to both sides are a paved 14km
Taba-Eilat-Aqaba promenade snaking around the Gulf of Aqaba, shared use of
airports, ports and roads, joint management of water, waste and sewage and
co-operation to combat industrial pollution and preserve the delicate marine
environment.
'The only way to survive in the world today is to be part of something
bigger and to co-operate with your neighbours,' says Mr Dov Sharf, the town
clerk. 'Both sides have to be satisfied. We can help the Jordanians a lot
and they can help us.'
An obvious example is shared use of airports. Eilat, which receives at least
500,000 visitors a year, has a small airport which cuts the town in half and
cannot receive jumbo jets. The town would like to close the airport or
shorten it for internal flights only, and use the large Jordanian airport at
Aqaba, which operates at 10 per cent capacity, for charters and
international flights.
The municipality has developed a proposal for a separate exit terminal for
Eilat from the Aqaba airport, similar to the separate exits at Basle airport
to France and Switzerland. Under this arrangement Israel would pay Jordan
for airport services.
Co-ordination in pollution, environmental production and town planning is
also vital in an area short of land and developing rapidly.
Two projects are almost certain to be among the first in the wake of the
summit in Washington - a Dollars 450m toll road linking Egypt to Jordan via
Israel and the phased opening of the border, first to foreign tourists and
then to Israelis and Jordanians.
The road has been planned for more than a decade but has been held up
pending progress in peace talks. Israel wants to construct a 14km tunnel
from Ras el Naqeb in Egypt to Ein Evrona, 17km north of Eilat on the
Israeli-Jordanian border. Such a tunnel would avoid traffic congestion in
Eilat and lessen security and customs difficulties for transit traffic.
Trucks and buses destined for Jordan and Saudi Arabia would have a fast
channel.
The road would link, for the first time, Jordan and Saudi Arabia with North
Africa for cargo and commerce. Israel hopes much of the money would come
from foreign private investors and would like Saudi Arabia to participate.
Much of the traffic on the road would be North African pilgrims to Mecca who
now have to take the ferry from Nuweiba, in the Egyptian Sinai, to Aqaba. At
the height of the annual pilgrimage, at least 4,000 people are ferried
across the Red Sea every day.
Opening the borders to tourism is also a easy first step with obvious
economic benefits. Once foreign tourists can cross between Eilat and Aqaba,
the two countries can market combination packages and develop joint
promotion campaigns overseas with a 'peace' package which might include the
Red Sea, Jerusalem, Petra, the Dead Sea, Wadi Rum and the Negev desert for
the price of one air ticket. With Egypt in a regional tourism association,
Cairo, Luxor and Aswan would all be reachable.
The tourist boom is already unfolding in Eilat. The Dollars 90m, 370-room
Royal Beach Hotel, part of the Isrotel chain, has just opened. At least
eight hotels are under construction to join the existing 43 hotels with an
average occupancy last year of 85 per cent. The tourism ministry says Eilat
will double its hotel rooms to 12,000 within five years.
In October, the city will open a Dollars 5m artificial lagoon development on
the north beach and break ground on a Dollars 6m regional tourist management
university and a Dollars 5.5m sports centre which it hopes will attract
international teams from Europe seeking a warm winter training location.
Government and municipal development, combined with the prospect of an
opening of the Israeli-Jordanian border, will fuel further private-sector
investment. The biggest Israeli development will be in the Timna Valley,
site of ancient copper mines, 28km north of Eilat. Mr Sol Kerzner, the South
African hotel tycoon, has proposed to build a Dollars 450m Holy Land 'Sun
City' if the government grants him a concession for a complex of casinos, at
present banned in Israel. A French consortium has also tabled plans for a
massive resort development, as has a sister company of Disneyland.

FT  22 JUL 94 / World Trade News: US renews pressure on China over
intellectual piracy

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US yesterday renewed pressure on Beijing to open its markets and stamp
out technological piracy, ahead of a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
meeting next week which is due to discuss the terms on which China would
re-join the body.
Ms Charlene Barshefsky, deputy US trade representative, said in Beijing that
China must open its markets wider to US services industries notably
insurance and telecommunications.
The US is also demanding that China crack down on abuse of intellectual
property rights, which US industries say currently costs them almost Dollars
1bn (Pounds 600m) annually.
Ms Barshefsky, who is in Beijing for negotiations with Ms Wu Yi, China's
foreign trade minister, is pressing China to close 26 factories which the US
says are using pirated technology to produce compact discs for export.
US officials have been concerned by the discovery of discs throughout
south-east Asia and in Canada. The factories can make up to 75m discs a
year, Ms Barshefsky said.
The US government last month gave China six months to enforce laws to
protect intellectual property such as trademarks and copyrights. Without
improvement, China faces US trade sanctions on Dollars 800m worth of
exports.
Ms Barshefsky said her talks with Ms Wu were 'constructive,' though progress
in opening up China to foreign goods was progressing slowly.
This week - after weeks of delay - the first shipment of US apples arrived
in Shanghai. Though Ms Barshefsky was pleased China was accepting more
foreign agricultural goods, she said it was 'unacceptable' that China was
importing apples from only one US state, Washington.
Ms Barshefsky also criticised recent statements by China that it plans to
offer a 'final' set of concessions, which were not open to further
negotiation, at next week's talks in Geneva on its application to re-join
Gatt. She said Beijing's approach was 'not productive' and 'a recipe
designed not to reach agreement'.
AP adds from Beijing: The Chinese cabinet has responded to US pressure by
agreeing to meet regularly to discuss intellectual property right
infringements, an official newspaper said yesterday.
The China Daily said the cabinet aimed to draw attention to infringements
and had called on state-run media to highlight them.

<TEXT>
Taiwan's trade negotiators yesterday met their Japanese counterparts in
Tokyo to seek Japan's support for Taipei's bid to join the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade. During the talks, Japan requested concessions and set
conditions which Taiwan said could aggravate Taipei's growing trade deficit
with Japan.
Japan insisted on three conditions for granting its support to Taiwan's Gatt
entry bid, according to local newspaper reports.
Japan urged Taiwan to: eliminate restrictions on imports of Japanese cars
and locomotives; amend regulations favouring European and American companies
in government and state enterprise purchasing and in the awarding of major
infrastructure contracts; and lower tariffs and import restrictions on
manufactured industrial products.
Taiwan has drawn up a five-year plan to curb its trade deficit with Japan,
economics minister Mr Chiang Pin-kung said yesterday. Under the plan, the
government will promote Taiwanese products and sales in Japan and cut
imports of Japanese products by obtaining the technology and capital needed
to manufacture products locally.
Mr Chiang said he would raise the issue of Taiwan's deficit during a
ministerial meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) forum
scheduled for October in Osaka.
'We need co-operative measures from both the government and the private
sector in Japan such as tariff cuts and support for Taiwan's industrial
upgrading,' Mr Chiang said.
The bilateral trade deficit was Dollars 14.42bn (Pounds 9.3bn) in 1993 and
is forecast to top Dollars 16bn this year.
Taiwan has said it wants to join Gatt by the end of this year in order to
become a founding member of the World Trade Organisation which supersedes
Gatt on January 1.

Nigeria's military government appears ready to seek a compromise on the
industrial and wage demands of striking oil workers if they drop their
political demands and return to work.
In a meeting in Lagos scheduled for today, Mr Umaru Baba, the junior oil
minister, will meet representatives of both the main unions and the
operating companies.
There were signs at a meeting with the government and employers on Wednesday
that the junior workers' union, Nupeng, was willing to end the strike in
return for settlement of two pay disputes with employers, information on the
whereabouts of their general secretary Mr Frank Kokori, and assurances that
the government will restore oil industry investment and move quickly towards
democracy.
Nupeng provisionally agreed to pay offers on Wednesday. The union, whose
members have received no pay since the two-week strike began, appeared to
soften their stance and said they would consider returning to work if the
oil companies attended today's meeting and confirmed that the government was
increasing investment.
The senior staff association, Pengassan, said yesterday it would attend the
meeting if invited but would not compromise on either its political or
economic demands.
The strikers are demanding that the military leave government and make way
for Mr Moshood Abiola - widely regarded as the winner of last year's
annulled presidential election - who is in prison facing treason charges for
declaring himself president last month.

FT  22 JUL 94 / US set to act on Rwanda refugees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEN WARN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday ordered US officials to draw up a 'plan of
action' to help Rwanda refugees, now hit by cholera in teeming, squalid
camps just over the border in Zaire.
Under pressure to ease the refugee crisis, Mr Clinton said in Washington the
US aimed to lead a United Nations effort 'responding to the cholera problem
and dealing with the other aspects of this human catastrophe'. He would
announce more details today.
About 1m refugees, mostly Hutus, fled across the border to the Zairean town
of Goma in the past week to escape advancing rebels of the Rwanda Patriotic
Front, dominated by Tutsis. The RPF has taken power in Rwanda after months
of turmoil during which Hutus slaughtered hundreds of thousands of Tutsis.
Mr Clinton acted to speed up US help after being briefed by Mr Brian
Attwood, a top aid official he had sent to Zaire.
After the meeting, Mr Attwood said that Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN
secretary general, would today appeal to donor nations to provide about
Dollars 274m worth of aid for the refugees.
The US would provide Dollars 41.4m of aid in addition to the Dollars 35m
announced earlier in the week, he said. The new aid would include 30,000
tonnes of grain and logistical support for relief organisations.
He said the US was ready to set up a base in Entebbe, Uganda, to handle the
food, medicines and equipment needed for the region. The US was also
considering helping French forces to keep the airport at Goma in repair so
aircraft could continue to bring in supplies.
US troops would be required for the stepped up aid effort, but would not go
into Rwanda, Mr Attwood said. However, the role of the US military was being
studied and 'we should have more information on that in a few days'.
Aid workers in Goma, overwhelmed by the influx of refugees, said it was
already too late to prevent many deaths from cholera, which had been
spreading in the last two days.
'You can expect between 10,000 and 50,000 cases,' said a doctor of Medecins
Sans Frontieres in Goma, and up to half would die.
He said his team saw 800 bodies before they stopped counting yesterday on a
five-mile stretch of road near Goma. 'They're dying from dysentery,
dehydration, exhaustion, and now cholera.'

FT  22 JUL 94 / Sony closes plant as local demand falls
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sony, the consumer electronics company, said yesterday it was halting
production at a plant in central Japan because of a decline in the domestic
market.
The plant at Atsuta, outside Nagoya, is one of two in Japan where Sony
produces printed circuit boards for video cameras. The company will
consolidate domestic production at its other Japanese plant.
Meanwhile, Matsushita, the world's largest consumer electronics company,
said yesterday it intended to reduce its administrative staff by 30 per
cent, or about 6,000 people, by the end of fiscal 1996 rather than the end
of fiscal 1997, as originally planned. The cuts are part of an attempt to
improve profit-to-sales ratio to 5 per cent by the end of 1996 from 1.5 per
cent in 1993.
The announcements by Japan's two leading consumer electronics companies
highlight the difficulties the industry faces after several years of falling
profits and efforts to cut costs and restructure.
The domestic environment has changed dramatically from the days when
manufacturers expected rising demand for a wide array of products.
The maturing of the market, coupled with demands for cheaper products and a
flood of low-priced imports from Asian countries, has triggered a sharp fall
in prices.
Sony's move marks the first time in its recent history that production has
been halted completely at a plant. 'The Atsuta plant is feeling the effects
of lower demand in the camcorder market,' a Sony official said yesterday.
The plant faced other concerns, such as insufficient space to expand, a lack
of abundant water needed to wash printed circuit boards, and its age: the
facility was opened in 1973.
The move also highlights Sony's need to develop more innovative products
that can trigger market demand. In video cameras, for example, the group
blemished its image as an innovator when it followed Sharp, a smaller
company, in launching a video camera with a built-in screen.
Matsushita, meanwhile, faces pressure to streamline its vast administrative
workforce, which numbers 20,000 across seven group companies. The group's
large administrative staff has become a symbol of how it has grown into a
corporate dinosaur, out of touch with market realities.
Japanese consumer electronics makers such as Matsushita and Sony will have
to move swiftly, analysts believe, to restructure their operations to meet
the demands of a new era.
Japanese households spent less in May for the fourth month in succession,
but a subsequent surge in sales of beer and air conditioners due to an
unusually hot summer may revive consumption, writes William Dawkins in
Tokyo.
The latest household survey by the government's management and co-ordination
agency shows a 1.7 per cent drop in consumer spending in the year to May.
Spending rose for four months until February, but then moved into reverse in
line with a weaker labour market.
An agency official said May's decline was due mainly to lower spending on
rice, a reaction to widespread stockpiling because of shortages earlier in
the year.

US and North Korean officials, meeting in New York, agreed yesterday on a
date for the two countries to resume negotiations on their nuclear dispute,
agencies report. The date, during the first week of August, is expected to
be announced today after it has been confirmed by top officials in
Washington and Pyongyang.
The negotiations, which began in Geneva on July 8, were broken off after
only one day because of the death of North Korean leader Kim Il-sung.
The US is offering diplomatic and economic concessions if North Korea
abandons any plans to build nuclear weapons.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Dollars 10,000 coin 'passed to consultant': Standard
Chartered to continue to investigate alleged payments

<TEXT>
A Dollars 10,000 gold coin which Standard Chartered gave to a Malaysian
former deputy finance minister disappeared after he had passed it on to a
Malaysian-based consultant, the international bank said yesterday.
Standard Chartered has been investigating the disappearance of the coin as
part of its probe into allegations that employees of its Mocatta gold
trading division may have made payments to officials in the Philippines and
Malaysia to win business.
The bank said yesterday that in 1991 it had given the coin to Mr Abdul Ghani
Othman, the then deputy finance minister who is now Malaysia's youth and
sport minister. He had been given the coin as a 'sample', during discussions
with Mocatta on whether Malaysia should impose a 10 per cent tax on gold
imports, according to a Standard Chartered banker.
At the time, the bank was considering setting up a bonded warehouse for gold
in Malaysia. Mr Abdul said that during the meeting with Mocatta he had been
shown a sample of gold coin which was to be used to ascertain whether it was
legal tender or gold bullion. 'If the gold coin was considered legal tender,
then it should not be taxed.'
On Tuesday, the Financial Times disclosed that the coin had disappeared.
Standard Chartered has now been told by Mr Abdul Ghani that he returned it
to Dr Stephen Goh, who was a consultant to Mocatta based in Kuala Lumpur.
Mr Goh has told Standard Chartered that he misplaced the coin. Standard
Chartered said Mr Goh had recompensed the bank for it.
'That is the end of the matter,' Standard Chartered said yesterday. However,
the bank is continuing to investigate other alleged payments by Mocatta
employees to officials in the Asia Pacific region.
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, said yesterday Standard
Chartered had a right to investigate the matter, and that his government
would not comment until the investigation was completed.
The disclosure of Standard's investigation into the disappearance of the
coin came at a sensitive time for Anglo-Malaysian trade relations. The UK
Foreign Office is hopeful that Malaysia will soon lift a ban on UK
participation in Malaysian government contracts, which was imposed in
February because of Malaysian fury with British press reports of the Pergau
Dam alleged arms-for-aid deal and allegations of bribes offered to Malaysian
politicians.
Mr Abdul said it had been 'presumptuous on the part of the British media to
say that a Malaysian minister could be bought with one gold coin'.

An Indonesian court sentenced a former bank manager to nine years in prison
yesterday in a loan fraud case that has cost a state bank more than Dollars
448m (Pounds 290m), AP reports from Jakarta.
Meanwhile, the prosecution demanded life imprisonment for the Chinese
businessman whose company took out the loan from the state-owned Bank
Pembangunan Indonesia.
Questions have also been raised about the roles of senior officials
including President Suharto's chief adviser, but they are not on trial.
Mr Maman Suparman, 48, former manager of the bank's South Jakarta branch,
was found guilty of receiving a 256m rupiah (Pounds 75,800) bribe from
businessman Mr Eddy Tanzil and illegally converting documents to help him
obtain the loan and use it improperly.
The South Jakarta District Court also fined Mr Suparman 15m rupiahs and
ordered that his house and land be confiscated.
His lawyers said they would appeal. 'There was no evidence found during the
trial that Suparman has received bribery in connection with the loan,' said
Mr Danny Kaliamang, who led a six-member defence team.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Hong Kong and Beijing let money do the talking: Monetary
developments on the eve of a debt issue that matures after the handover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Joseph Yam, governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the colony's
equivalent of a central bank, pores over a chart showing the yields on Hong
Kong government bonds compared with other borrowers.
What they tell him is that whereas the yields on Hong Kong government debt
of less than three years' maturity are lower than, say US government paper,
yields on Hong Kong paper maturing after three years are higher.
'I suppose there is concern about inflation, the outlook for interest rates
and some residual worries with politics and policies,' says Mr Yam.
On Monday investors will be tendering for another HKDollars 500m (Pounds
41m) of the authority's bonds. What make these of special interest is that
they mature nearly a month after China resumes sovereignty over Hong Kong on
July 1, 1997.
As such, they, and the ones to follow, will become a bellwether of investor
confidence in the colony, along with its more visible stock market. If the
issue on Monday goes well, there are plans to introduce a five-year bond
later this year.
Hong Kong's government debt market is just four years old and already dwarfs
the colony's stock market. There are HKDollars 43bn bonds in issue, but
turnover approaches HKDollars 20bn on most days. This compares with a stock
market at its most active of around HKDollars 8bn a day and currently
languishing around HKDollars 3bn a day.
That this activity occurs at all seems to defy economic and diplomatic
logic. The Hong Kong government has no fiscal need to borrow; its budget has
been in surplus for as long as most can remember. Moreover, in the
Sino-British memorandum of understanding (MOU) which paved the way for Hong
Kong to build a new airport the colonial government was limited to borrowing
no more than HKDollars 5bn.
The logic that has been at work is the logic of the markets. Monetary reform
in 1988 necessitated the establishment of a short-term money market, after
which it was a short step to issuing instruments with longer maturities.
Mr Yam admits that the MOU has been disregarded on this score. He expects
that at the handover there will be, with the approval of the Chinese
government, at least HKDollars 40bn of debt still due to mature after the
change in sovereignty. 'It just shows you how pragmatic they are,' he says.
The authority has kept China informed of its plans every step of the way and
because of that it has won Beijing's support for the continuation of the
borrowing programme after 1997.
'This is not political reform but monetary reform and both sides recognised
that there was no problem. On the monetary side the scope for differences of
opinion is very small. Stability and prosperity is the aim and monetary
stability will contribute to it,' says Mr Yam.
He says he had qualms about the government borrowing when it was first
mooted five years ago, but he recognised that changes to the regulation of
banks made borrowing necessary. In 1988 the government took responsibility
for influencing the level of interest rates in the inter-bank money market,
hence the introduction of short-term money market bills.
After that it was just a matter of time before instruments with longer
maturities were issued. As the market has grown, so too has the
sophistication of the authority's role in Hong Kong's money market.
Last year it introduced a 'discount window' at which banks are able to make
good short-term cash deficiencies by selling a portion of their Hong Kong
government debt portfolios. Moreover, as the authority has issued
longer-term bonds, a retail investor market has developed.
No matter how good the authority's relations with Beijing, China nonetheless
presents special problems for an institution trying to establish Hong Kong's
separate identity in the world of international finance.
For one, there is Hong Kong's credit rating after 1997. Mr Yam lists a
string of arguments why Hong Kong should be treated differently from the
mainland, not the least being its guarantee of autonomy in financial
affairs. But he is having a difficult time persuading the credit rating
agencies.
Another issue is the ownership by mainland interests of a large part of Hong
Kong's money supply. Already more than 20 per cent of the colony's physical
stock of notes circulates in southern China.
Mr Yam's main concern, however, is the HKDollars 48bn (as of April) of Hong
Kong dollars deposited in the colony's banks by mainland banks. A rapid
conversion of this money to US dollars could put a large strain on the HK
dollar's link with the US currency.
'Who controls this money is of interest to us,' he says with some
understatement. 'If it's by individuals then I'm not worried. But if it is
by the centre (Chinese government) then, for policy reasons, they may want
to control it.'
If that were the case, then Hong Kong's promised financial autonomy would be
in jeopardy. On balance, however, Mr Yam does not believe these funds are
within the control of the Chinese government - 'I think it's a reflection of
economics rather than political activity' - but for a man whose prime task
is the preservation of currency stability he maintains a watchful eye on the
money flows.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Israel closer to giving up Golan: Syria gets strong signals
as Christopher heads for Damascus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Israel yesterday sent further strong signals to Syria that it was preparing
Israeli public opinion for returning the occupied Golan Heights, as Mr
Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, prepared to fly to Damascus
during his current Middle East mission.
Mr Yossi Sarid, the Israeli environment minister, who has played an
important role in Arab-Israeli peace talks, said Israel would have to make a
'deep and painful' withdrawal from the Golan in return for security, peace
and normal relations.
Mr Sarid also said he believed an Israeli-Syrian declaration of principles
for peace would be concluded this year.
Mr Sarid's comments underlined the shift in Israel's negotiating position
since Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said last week Israel now
recognised Syrian sovereignty over the entire strategic Heights. Mr Peres
also referred to a 1967 secret cabinet resolution calling for negotiations
with Syria on the basis of the international border of 1967.
Until last week Israel had refused to commit itself in public to a full
withdrawal from all the Golan land seized in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war,
although privately many senior politicians have said they fully understand
that President Hafez al-Assad of Syria would not settle for anything less.
Several Labour party politicians close to Mr Peres are now seeking to annul
the 1981 law which annexed the Golan Heights.
Mr Peres sought to reinforce overtures to Damascus yesterday during a trip
to Cairo to brief President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt on recent peace
developments. 'It is essential for Israel to have peace with Syria. . . We
cannot leave any open wounds,' he said.
Mr Christopher yesterday met Mr Yassir Arafat, Chairman of the PLO, in Gaza
to stress the importance of transparency and accountability in the release
of hundreds of millions of dollars of aid to the embryonic Palestinian
self-rule authority.
Mr Christopher's visit has been marked by a flurry of Arab-Israeli diplomacy
with meetings between Israel and Jordan before the summit on Monday in
Washington between King Hussein of Jordan and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli
prime minister.
The Israeli-Jordanian meetings decided continuous bilateral negotiations
over borders, water and security in Jordan and in Israel; monthly summits at
foreign minister level; accelerated joint economic projects ahead of a
formal peace treaty and an undertaking by Jordan to prepare for the
suspension of the boycott of Israeli goods and companies.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Household spending may rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese households spent less in May for the fourth consecutive month, but
a surge in sales of beer and air conditioners due to an unusually hot summer
may revive consumption.
The latest household survey by the government's management and co-ordination
agency shows a 1.7 per cent drop in consumer spending in the year to May, to
an average of Y316,080 (Pounds 2,060) per house-hold.
Household spending rose for four months until February, but then moved into
reverse in line with increased weakening in the labour market. An agency
official said May's decline was mainly due to less spending on rice, a
reaction to widespread stockpiling because of rice shortages at the start of
the year.
However, an income tax rebate paid in June - worth Y40,000 to an average
wage earner on Y4.7m a year - and the onset of sweltering heat in July could
lift household spending again, the official added.

An Indonesian court sentenced a former bank manager to nine years in prison
yesterday in a loan fraud case that has cost a state bank more than Dollars
448m (Pounds 290m), AP reports from Jakarta.
Meanwhile, the prosecution demanded life imprisonment for the Chinese
businessman whose company took out the loan from the state-owned Bank
Pembangunan Indonesia.
Questions have also been raised about the roles of senior officials
including President Suharto's chief adviser, but they are not on trial.
Mr Maman Suparman, 48, former manager of the bank's South Jakarta branch,
was found guilty of receiving a 256m rupiah (Pounds 75,800) bribe from
businessman Mr Eddy Tanzil and illegally converting documents to help him
obtain the loan and use it improperly.
The South Jakarta District Court also fined Mr Suparman 15m rupiahs and
ordered that his house and land be confiscated.
His lawyers said they would appeal.
'There was no evidence found during the trial that Suparman has received
bribery in connection with the loan,' said Mr Danny Kaliamang, who led a
six-member defence team.
The prosecution had demanded a 13-year sentence for Suparman, the first
person to be tried in the case.
At the Central Jakarta District Court, Mr Hamid Bachmid, the prosecutor,
demanded life imprisonment for Tanzil, who obtained a Dollars 430m loan in
1991 for his Golden Key Group for a petrochemical plant.
Mr Bachmid said the loan was not used as intended, causing a loss to the
state of Dollars 448.8m, including unpaid interest.
Also on trial is Mr Towil Haryoto, a former president director of the bank.
Two other directors are still awaiting trial.
Thousands of students demonstrated in several large cities last month,
demanding that two senior officials resign over the loan fraud case. Some
protesters also called for interrogation of President Suharto's youngest
son, Mr Hutomo Mandalaputra.

There were injuries on both sides, the witnesses said.
The government is expected to invoke emergency powers to settle the labour

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The first step towards establishing an international criminal court to try
such crimes as genocide, war crimes, terrorist acts and drug trafficking was
taken yesterday, with the adoption of the court's draft statutes by the
United Nations International Law Commission.
Mr James Crawford, an Australian lawyer who chaired negotiations on the
statutes, said such a court would avoid the 'second-class justice' of ad hoc
tribunals set up after crimes have been committed and before charges against
individuals have been brought.
The UN Security Council last year set up a war crimes tribunal for former
Yugoslavia and a similar tribunal has been proposed to try perpetrators of
genocide in Rwanda.
The court's statutes are due to be debated by the UN General Assembly later
this year. If approved, the way would be clear for negotiations to put them
into international treaty form. Among crimes over which the court would have
jurisdiction are genocide, aggression by one state against another, crimes
against humanity and violation of Geneva Conventions on conduct in wartime.
It would also try 'exceptionally serious crimes of international concern'
involving breaches of international treaties that outlaw torture, apartheid,
hijacking and hostage-taking, and other internationally recognised crimes
such as drug trafficking.
Mr Crawford said the court could have jurisdiction over such cases as the
Lockerbie airliner bombing. Libya has so far refused a Security Council
demand for the accused to be extradited to stand trial, on the grounds they
would not get a fair hearing.
But except for genocide and cases initiated by the Security Council, the
court could try suspects only if the country holding them and the country
where the crime was committed agreed that it should.
Mr Vladen Vereshchetin, Russian chairman of the commission, stressed
yesterday the court was intended to complement national justice systems and
to act in cases where national procedures were not available or effective.
Under the draft statutes, the court could issue warrants for arrest and
detention of suspects. They would have the right to silence, the right not
to incriminate themselves and the right to a public trial with legal defence
of their choice.
If they are found guilty, the court could impose a prison term or a fine,
but not the death penalty. Prisoners would serve sentences in a designated
country.
The court would have its own independent prosecutor and consist of 18 judges
elected by treaty members, with a seven-person appeals chamber. Five judges
would be selected to hear each trial.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Brady in Peru bank investment: Ex-US Treasury secretary's
company in consortium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LIMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A company formed by former US Treasury secretary Mr Nicholas Brady is to
invest in Peru's commercial banking sector, rated a high risk while it
awaits a Brady plan to reschedule its debt.
A dearth of foreign financing, while the plan is being negotiated, has kept
local interest rates extremely high and commercial banking operations
lucrative.
Through his private US company, Darby Overseas, Mr Brady is participating in
a Cayman Islands-registered consortium which on Wednesday acquired one of
Peru's two state-owned banks.
The consortium, International Financial Holdings (IFH), this week picked up
Interbanc, Peru's fourth largest commercial bank, for Dollars 51m. IFH is
pledging to spend Dollars 30m more on modernisation and capital expansion.
The auction had been expected to attract five or six bids, with the
government saying it wanted to attract a big international bank. However,
the two front runners - Spain's Banco de Santander and Chile's Banco
O'Higgins - dropped out late last week.
Sale day brought three bids, two of them from local groups, at or just above
the Dollars 45m base price, which banking experts had considered low.
Immediately after the sale, COPRI, the government privatisation commission,
handed out a press release saying IFH had bought Interbanc, and giving
details of IFH's shareholders. In addition to Darby Overseas, the consortium
is reported to include Bechtel Enterprises, Shetland Securities, and
shareholders linked to Chile's Banco Osorno and a private pension fund from
Chile, Provida.
Under the bidding conditions, a bank had to participate or provide technical
advice or assistance. Banco Osorno itself is not part of the consortium, but
the involvement of some of its shareholders was considered sufficient.
Darby Overseas was set up a year ago by Mr Brady, his chief aide at the
Treasury, Mr Hollis McLoughlin, and Mr Daniel Marx, Argentine finance
undersecretary, who has since resigned to become managing director of Darby
Overseas.
IFH's purchase will be largely financed through a Dollars 60m (Pounds 38.7m)
private placement of notes, to be handled by Morgan Grenfell, acting as
IFH's financial advisers. The notes will be convertible to Interbanc shares
at the end of five years. Deutsche Bank is underwriting the issue.
The prime mover behind IFH, specially constituted to bid for Interbanc, is
Mr Carlos Rodriguez Pastor, Peru's economy minister in the early 1980s. The
latter has already participated in Peru's sweeping privatisation process: he
has a stake in the consortium which bought Aeroperu, the former state-owned
airline.

to roll back the separatist Parti Quebecois' lead in the polls, writes
Robert Gibbens from Montreal. Recent opinion polls put the PQ 10 points
ahead among decided voters, with the undecideds having declined sharply.

The Ecuadorian government has suffered a severe blow to its privatisation
programme with parliament's rejection of a bill to allow the sale of shares
in the state telephone company, Emetel, which is worth an estimated Dollars
1.7bn (Pounds 1.1bn), Raymond Colitt writes from Quito. Opposition parties
claimed the reform was unconstitutional, since the constitution says the
telecommunications sector should be controlled by the state because of its
strategic importance to the economy.
The state modernisation body, Conam, insisted that reform efforts would
continue despite the defeat. Ecuador's privatisation programme has been
criticised for poor management and under-pricing. However, the latest
setback comes only a week after the successful sale of the country's second
largest cement company, Cementos Selva Alegre.

<TEXT>
The Clinton administration has abandoned its effort to force the computer
industry to introduce a semiconductor known as a clipper chip, which would
have let intelligence services eavesdrop on the information superhighway,
Ken Warn writes from Washington.
The chip, developed by the National Security Agency, would have made it
possible for users of personal computers to scramble or encrypt their
communications, but would also have allowed law enforcement or security
agencies to tap in.
The administration's change of mind emerged in a letter, released this week,
from Vice President Al Gore to Representative Maria Cantwell, whose
Washington state district is home to Microsoft computer software company,
which vehemently opposed the clipper chip.
The chip remained the desired standard for telephone communications, Mr
Gore's letter said, but not for computer exchanges. The administration would
continue to work with the industry on a voluntary encryption standard.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US last night sought UN Security Council blessing for a possible
invasion of Haiti by troops of an American-led multinational coalition,
Michael Littlejohns writes from the United Nations. Ms Madeleine Albright,
the US ambassador, said a formal resolution being discussed with other
members would call for the use of 'all necessary means' to secure what she
termed 'a stable environment' in Haiti.
In UN parlance, 'all necessary means' includes military action, and
establishing stability in Haiti would require the removal of its military
regime.
Ms Albright told journalists she was proposing a two-phased resolution, to
approve a multinational force that would lead to a subsequent UN operation.
The UN's task would be to 'preserve that secure environment' achieved by the
international troops and ensure the implementation of the key elements of
the year-old Governors Island agreement. This has been renounced by General
Raoul Cedras, the Haitian military leader who signed the accord in New York.
As well as calling for the reinstatement of exiled President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide it provides for the reorganisation and training of the military and
police forces blamed for excesses that have caused thousands of Haitians to
flee the country.

The Ecuadorian government has suffered a severe blow to its privatisation
programme with parliament's rejection of a bill to allow the sale of shares
in the state telephone company, Emetel, which is worth an estimated Dollars
1.7bn (Pounds 1.1bn).
Opposition parties claimed the reform was unconstitutional since the
constitution states that the telecommunications sector should be controlled
by the state because of its strategic importance to the economy.
The opposition also objected to the government's decision to see the
legislation through on the fast track, which, they said, allowed them
insufficient time to analyse it.
However, the government argued that as long as the state was in regulatory
control of the sector, the constitution allowed for private-sector operation
of telecommunications.
The state modernisation body, Conam, insisted that reform efforts would
continue despite the bill's defeat.
Ecuador's privatisation programme has been criticised for poor management
and under-pricing. However, the latest setback comes only a week after the
successful sale of the country's second largest cement company, Cementos
Selva Alegre, which had improved the programme's image.
The Spanish cement giant, Uniland, bought 51 per cent of the state's shares
in Cementos Selva Alegre for Dollars 40m, on behalf of the consortium,
Finlatam.
With only eight in 100 citizens having a telephone line, Ecuador has one of
the most backward telecommunication systems in Latin America. The investment
required to install 1m more telephone lines and improve the infrastructure
is estimated at Dollars 1.4bn. Telephone lines go for as much as Dollars
1,000 on the black market.

FT  22 JUL 94 / The New Economic Order: Latin Americans rediscover their
neighbours' markets - Companies are looking next door as protectionism gives
way to competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Latin American countries, for decades forced by trade barriers to look
beyond their neighbours, are rediscovering one another's markets.
Protectionism is slowly being replaced by competition and governments are
withdrawing from economies. As a result, big private companies are starting
to think of the region when they make their plans.
Brahma, Latin America's biggest brewer, is expanding beyond Brazil, where it
has a 50 per cent market share. A factory opens in Argentina in January to
serve southern countries such as Argentina and Chile. Earlier this year
Brahma bought Venezuela's second-largest brewer, Cervecera Nacional, which
will give access to important northern markets such as Colombia.
Mr Marcel Herrmann Telles, Brahma's chief executive, says the company will
move into other countries in the continent once it has built up sales
through exports.
'The idea is for Brahma to become the brand name for all of Latin America,'
he says.
The shift towards regional rather than national thinking has two main
motors. First, regional trade groupings are leading to closer cross-border
ties. Second, increasing personal wealth is improving cultural links via
television and foreign holidays for the middle classes.
Mercosur, the most important trade grouping to have developed so far, has
led to rapid increases in cross-border trade and investment among its four
members, Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. Trade between the four
countries has more than doubled since the agreement was signed in 1991 and
reached about Dollars 8bn last year as tariffs have been reduced.
Mercosur's success has had a marked impact on exporters in Brazil, Latin
America's biggest economy, who have traditionally relied on US and European
markets. Exports to Mercosur partners, which accounted for 4 per cent of
Brazil's total exports in 1990, reached 14 per cent of the total last year.
The proportion of exports to the US and European Union, meanwhile, have
fallen from 24 to 21 per cent and 31 to 26 per cent.
Brahma's expansion into Argentina has been helped by Mercosur, especially
because of reduced bureaucracy and customs procedures. But the company's
overseas push was at first prompted by some very Brazilian circumstances.
Until recently Brazil's government set price ceilings on beer, which limited
the company's profits and investment. The removal of price controls in 1990,
one of a number of measures adopted by former president Fernando Collor to
liberalise Brazil's markets, allowed Brahma to restore profitability. But it
coincided with a steep recession, which lasted until last year and led to
declining beer sales.
'We therefore had the time and the resources to look at the rest of the
world,' says Mr Telles. 'We thought our competitive advantage lay in Latin
America where the Brahma name had resonance, so we started exporting to
Argentina.'
Brahma started selling canned beer to Argentina in 1990. Two years later it
switched to exporting 1-litre returnable bottles, a system described as
'logistically almost impossible' by Mr Telles and which involves the return
to Brazil of lorry loads of empty beer bottles. Even so, Brahma claims a 7
per cent share of the Argentine market, which it hopes to increase once the
new brewery opens.
Mr Telles says Brahma's expansion makes sense because of a similarity among
the region's beer markets. With the exception of Brazil, where three brewers
are in often vicious competition, the main markets are dominated by near
monopolies. These companies often owe their pre-eminence to government
backing and a traditional lack of concern for competition. They include
Quilmes, which has more than 60 per cent of the Argentine market, and
Empresas Polar in Venezuela with a 90 per cent market share.
Brahma believes it can compete because consumers and distributors
increasingly want competition to improve the quality and range of products.
Governments are also less interested in blocking competition to defend
national companies. Argentina, which has been opening its economy since
1991, has not reacted against Brahma's gain in market share, says Mr Telles.
This is probably also because Argentina's beer market has grown rapidly, so
that domestic brewers have not lost sales.
'There is a process of opening, both commercial and cultural, going on in
Latin America. Certainly a few years ago it would not have been possible,'
says Mr Telles.
Further progress may be erratic. While there are similarities between
markets, there are also huge differences. Venezuelans like to drink beer on
the streets and in small bottles, the latter so that it does not warm up too
quickly in the heat. Argentines prefer to drink from larger bottles at home,
and increasingly buy their beer in supermarkets rather than bars.
'It's no good trying to use a standard formula for these markets, neither in
terms of taste, packaging or distribution,' Mr Telles says.
In spite of the growing trade links, a single regional grouping still looks
a long way off. Brazil's still uncompetitive economy is likely to delay the
other Mercosur countries, which are obliged to negotiate trade treaties
collectively, from linking with the US and Mexico in the North American Free
Trade Association.
Countries such as Chile may be candidates to join both groups. But other
countries, such as Colombia and Venezuela, appear ready to join neither.
Instead, a series of sometimes inter-linked free trade areas and bilateral
trade treaties, several of which exist, are likely to continue. These could
slow further tariff reductions and cross-border competition between areas,
forcing companies to think in terms of interlinked sub-regions. This article
is the sixth in a series on the recovery in Latin America. Previous articles
appeared on June 24 and 30, and July 5, 12 and 15

FT  22 JUL 94 / Europe's new parliament shows it means to be taken
seriously: MEPs issue wake-up call to Twelve with narrow vote for Santer -
Yesterday's meeting marked turning point for Strasbourg assembly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European parliament came of age yesterday. Casting aside a reputation
for low attendance and long-windedness, newly elected MEPs staged a
thoughtful debate on the nomination of Mr Jacques Santer which culminated in
a nerve-wracking climax.
The narrow vote in favour of Mr Santer, the Luxembourg prime minister and
one-time MEP, should serve as a wake-up call. Governments (and national
parliaments) who would like to condemn the parliament to irrelevance will
have to adjust to an institution which is determined to be treated as an
equal partner alongside the Council of Ministers and the Commission.
Mr Gijs De Vries, leader of the Liberal group, echoed a widespread sentiment
at this week's inaugural parliamentary session Strasbourg. 'We are
determined not be taken for granted. The net result of today's vote will be
greater parliamentary influence over the Commission.'
The relief on Mr Santer's face in victory suggests that he senses the
potential shift in power; so too, Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister,
who promised to consult more closely with the parliament in the choice of
future presidents of the Commission, a post which remains the most powerful
non-elected executive job in Europe.
British officials were more cautious. They recalled that, in 1979, the
newly-elected European parliament, the first elected by universal suffrage,
voted down the EU budget. This vote was also a muscle-flexing exercise aimed
at creating a crisis with the Council of Ministers, but it did not lead
immediately to new powers to control expenditure.
The parliament's threats of provoking an institutional crisis have
periodically led to accusations that its members are pursuing 'Duke of York'
tactics, marching its troops to the top of the hill and retreating at the
first whiff of cordite from the Council of Ministers.
Only a few months ago, MEPs backed off from threats to delay enlargement
because the Council refused to streamline voting procedures to make
decision-making easier once the European Union takes in Austria, Finland,
Sweden and Norway as members next year.
Many suspected that criticism of the nomination of Mr Santer to succeed Mr
Jacques Delors as Commission president was empty talk, too - though an early
warning of trouble came on Tuesday when MEPs used the Maastricht treaty's
powers to cast the first-ever vote of rejection against a Council of
Ministers' decision to liberalise the voice telecommunications market by
1998.
Two days later, the parliament tackled the Santer nomination. It was
encouraged by a selection process for the Commission president which was at
best ham-fisted, at worst a quick-fix which produced the lowest-common
denominator candidate.
The process began last year with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany vetoing
Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister, on personal grounds; it continued
with Prime Minister John Major of the UK vetoing Prime Minister Jean-Luc
Dehaene of Belgium last month to shore up his own position with Eurosceptics
in his own Conservative party; and it ended with Mr Kohl producing Mr Santer
last week as the candidate who, by his own admission, would have happily
remained in Luxembourg.
The debate on the Santer nomination suggests that new forces are at work,
unleashed by an influx of MEPs eager to take advantage of expanded powers
which the parliament gained in the 1991 Maastricht treaty. One such power
gives members the right to be 'consulted' on the Commission
president-designate, as well as the right to vote down the president and his
chosen team later in the year.
Until yesterday, most observers compared rejection of the Commission
president-designate to the equivalent of pressing a nuclear button. But more
than half of the present parliament are new and determined to make their
mark.
Many, such as Mr Michel Rocard, former French prime minister, or Mr Piet
Dankert, former Dutch minister for European affairs, have no hesitation
about lobbing political grenades. Others, such as Mr Bernard Tapie, the
maverick businessman and leader of a new populist Socialist group in his
native France, are natural performers.
Ms Pauline Green, the former British policewoman who now heads the powerful
Socialist group, ridiculed the selection process. The European Union
lectured the rest of the world on democratic rights, 'but these same
countries are willing to connive at some of the most squalid, shabby and
ill-judged practices to put in place the president of the European
Commission'.
Many members argued that a vote for Mr Santer would be equivalent to
condoning Mr Major's veto. Echoing widespread criticism of the UK
Conservative government, Mr Rocard said British objections to Mr Dehaene had
nothing to do with vital national interests and therefore amounted to an
abuse of the power.
Mr Gerhard Schmid, head of the German Socialists, had no qualms about
suggesting that Mr Santer simply lacked the stature and imagination for the
top job in Brussels. Quoting the German philosopher Ernst Bloch, he
declared: 'We need a president who is prepared to dream about the future.'
Mr De Vries wound up the debate by declaring that the selection process had
been akin to a cattle-market; Mr Santer was the tenth choice; and he lacked
the kind of inspirational leadership which Mr Delors had shown during his
near 10 years in Brussels. 'Jacques Santer will turn out to be more a man of
the past than a man of the future,' he said.
Yet other MEPs, particularly the tiny Luxembourg contingent and fellow
Christian Democrats, sprang to Mr Santer's defence. They noted that he had
been a top-notch prime minister of the Grand Duchy for 10 years, and that he
had contributed effectively to both the Single European Act and the
Maastricht treaty.
But it was Mr Kinkel, speaking for the German presidency, who made the most
effective contribution. Germany, he said, had fought hard to expand the
powers of the European parliament. Was the reward now to be a decision to
torpedo the Commission president-designate, the unanimous choice of the 12
member state governments?
'Do you want to punish Europe, punish the people of Europe? Give Jacques
Santer a chance,' he declared.
His appeal succeeded, albeit narrowly and only after a bizarre alliance of
forces came to Mr Santer's rescue. In the final count, the lucky
Luxembourger needed support from the Spanish Socialists (who did not want to
upset Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez) the Greek Socialists (who felt
similarly about Mr Andreas Papandreou), and the neo-fascists in the
parliament to squeeze out the 22-vote majority.
This ad hoc alliance underlines that the new parliament is likely to be
unpredictable and not easily intimidated. The next few months will see
further tests of strength with the Council, tempered only by the knowledge
that parliaments need to show responsibility, too, if they are convince the
outside world of their maturity

DIW, the Berlin-based economics institute, cast aside its earlier gloomy
predictions about the German economy and forecast growth of about 2 per cent
for 1994 and 1995. In its half-yearly report the institute said the economy
would grow by 1.5 per cent in western Germany and by 8.5 per cent in the
five eastern Lander, a surprising turnaround from forecasts earlier this
year. While five of the country's independent economics institutes presented
their April reports predicting growth of 1.5 per cent for the year, the DIW
had predicted zero growth for western Germany and 0.5 per cent for the
economy as a whole. Explaining the revision of its figures, the institute
said the spring interest rate cuts came as a surprise. It still expects a
downturn, a so-called 'double-dip', later this year but this would not
affect the forecast growth.

Mr Alberto Falck, owner of the biggest family steel concern in Italy, is
reported to have admitted paying L500m (Pounds 206,600) in bribes to members
of the Guardia di Finanza, the financial police, to soften their controls of
his group's balance sheet. The steel magnate is co-operating with
magistrates following the issuing of an arrest warrant last week by Milan
magistrates investigating alleged corruption in the Guardia di Finanza in
Lombardy, according to Ansa, the national news agency. Mr Falck was one of
49 people issued with a warrant on charges of alleged corruption at the
moment when the Italian government had approved the controversial decree,
since revoked, limiting the use of preventive detention. He was placed under
house arrest. His confession emerged as Milan magistrates resumed work this
week in the wake of the Berlusconi's government's climb-down on the decree.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Bosnia map approval retracted

The international peace plan for Bosnia disintegrated further yesterday when
Bosnian Serb leaders failed to give their unconditional acceptance and the
Bosnian president retracted his previous approval. Mr Radovan Karadzic,
Bosnian Serb leader, left Geneva after the sponsors of the plan - the
international 'contact group' made up of the US, Russia, UK, France and
Germany - refused further meetings with him, snubbing his attempt to
renegotiate the plan before giving an answer to it. Meanwhile, in Sarajevo
Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnian president, withdrew his previous unconditional
approval of the plan, saying that in view of the Serb rejection his
government now wanted to add conditions of its own.
Before leaving Geneva the Bosnian Serb delegation released the text of the
declaration on the plan adopted by their 'parliament' on Tuesday. This
requested more details on a range of issues, from constitutional
arrangements to the lifting of sanctions, and added ominously that 'further
work is required on the proposed map'.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Astra faces EU ban on top drug
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The German medicine institute, responsible for licensing drugs, has called
for a EU-wide ban on the injectable version of Losec, the top-selling
product of the Swedish pharmaceuticals group Astra. The EU's committee for
proprietary medicinal products will meet on Monday in Brussels to discuss
the issue. The German institute is concerned that Losec, an anti-ulcer
medicine, could cause blindness in some cases when administered by
injection. Between 40 and 50 incidents have been reported, according to
Astra. Losec is the group's most important product and saw sales in all its
versions last year of Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1.09bn). Sales this year have
increased by about 40 per cent, making it one of the world's fastest growing
medicines. Astra's B shares fell SKr1 to SKr161 (Pounds 13.40) yesterday.
The German institute has questioned only the injectable version of Losec,
not the pill form which represents about 97 per cent of all sales. However,
intravenous versions account for a higher proportion of sales in Europe.
Astra said it was looking forward to having the opportunity to defend the
safety record of Losec, one of the most significant competitors to Glaxo's
top-selling medicine Zantac.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Where Mr Jacques Santer stands on the burning political
issues of the Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Will the real Jacques Santer please stand up? Those listening to the
Luxembourg prime minister perform this week before the European parliament
might easily find themselves confused about his political credo,
particularly his views on economic and political integration in Europe,
writes Lionel Barber.
In Britain, where the governing Conservative party risks splitting over this
issue, the question is vital. Just where he stands - and how he differs from
Mr Jacques Delors, outgoing Commission president - is of intense interest.
The question has taken on even greater importance since Mr Santer insists
that he is no different from Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister
and fellow Christian Democrat, who was vetoed by the British at last month's
European summit in Corfu.
So here is a rough guide to Mr Santer's political views as revealed during
statements and questioning during this week's inaugural session of the
European parliament in Strasbourg.
Mr Santer supports federalism, but not on the 'Napoleonic model' which means
centralising power in Brussels. Like the British (and the Germans), he
favours 'subsidiarity', the principle of devolving decision-making to the
lowest appropriate national, regional and local level.
Mr Santer shares the Anglo-German concern that some Euro-laws can damage the
competitiveness of industry. He would like to continue auditing such
legislation, though at national and European level. He also is an unabashed
free-trader.
Mr Santer likes the Maastricht treaty's social chapter, unlike Mr John
Major, who proclaimed Britain's non-participation as one of the triumphs of
the Maastricht treaty negotiations.
Mr Santer is adamant that he will not use subsidiarity to roll back EU
environmental laws, and he does not like the Maastricht treaty's innovation
of opting out of treaty obligations affecting the rest of the EU.
Mr Santer supports strongly the idea of a single European currency
complementing the single European market, but, in line with Germany, he
insists that Maastricht's convergence criteria must be applied rigorously.
He refuses to be drawn on whether he is committed to loose governmental
co-operation on foreign and security policy and judicial affairs, or whether
he favours a deepening of co-operation through a community approach, perhaps
by extending majority voting.
This will relieve Mr Major who is insistent on resisting efforts to
streamline decision-making and weaken the power of national vetoes. But Mr
Santer made clear, too, that he sees the Maastricht treaty's powers in
common and security policy as 'evolutionary'.

FT  22 JUL 94 / US plans for spy chip abandoned
</HEADLINE>

   By KEN WARN

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration has abandoned its effort to force the computer
industry to introduce a semiconductor known as a clipper chip, which would
have let intelligence services eavesdrop on the information superhighway.
The chip, developed by the National Security Agency, would have made it
possible for users of personal computers to scramble or encrypt their
communications, but would also have allowed law enforcement or security
agencies to tap in.
The administration's change of mind emerged in a letter, released this week,
from Vice President Al Gore to Representative Maria Cantwell, whose
Washington state district is home to Microsoft computer software company,
which vehemently opposed the clipper chip.
The chip remained the desired standard for telephone communications, Mr
Gore's letter said, but not for computer exchanges. The administration would
continue to work with the industry on a voluntary encryption standard, he
said.
The policy shift 'is a significant victory both for US software companies
and the future of the global information superhighway', said Mr Robert
Holleyman, Business Software Alliance president.
The industry has opposed both the clipper chip and curbs on exports of
encryption programs, which the intelligence community claims hamper its
security work overseas. Civil liberties groups said the chip violated
privacy.
The security of the information superhighway is a growing issue in the US.
Hackers have gained access to sensitive but unclassified government and
military communications networks connected to the Internet, the New York
Times reported yesterday.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Kok aims to break Dutch deadlock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Netherlands' last chance to come up with a new government before autumn
rests firmly on the shoulders of Mr Wim Kok, the country's outgoing finance
minister and long-time leader of the Labour party.
At the request of Queen Beatrix, Mr Kok is working in secret on a government
programme which he hopes will break the impasse following inconclusive
general elections on May 3.
The fruits of his labours, begun two weeks ago, are expected to be revealed
on Monday. If his ideas are accepted by a majority of MPs, Mr Kok could
emerge as the next prime minister of a new coalition, succeeding Mr Ruud
Lubbers, the country's veteran leader who has kept the government ticking
over as a caretaker premier since May.
But if the Labour party rejects the proposals, Mr Kok might find he has
manoeuvred himself into a job as leader of the opposition.
The challenge for Mr Kok - to write a government programme single-handedly -
is unusual as Dutch coalitions are normally created through direct talks
between parties.
In May's elections the two biggest parties, the Christian Democrats and
Labour, lost heavily to the right-wing Liberals and D66, a left-of-centre
party. This fragmentation means that at least three parties will be needed
to form a government majority, in contrast to the outgoing two-party
coalition of Christian Democrats and Labour.
Queen Beatrix decided to appoint Mr Kok as a neutral 'informateur' above
party politics in early July, with his appointment coming days after a
six-week attempt to form a government between Labour, the Liberals and D66
failed.
However, it is looking increasingly likely that Mr Kok's efforts may yet
result in an historic 'purple' coalition between the three parties.
The term 'purple' comes from mixing the party hues; Labour's 'red', the
'Tory-blue' of the Liberals and the green logo of D66. But the term also
implies a coalition that would exclude the Christian Democrats from power
for the first time in modern Dutch politics.
The first attempt to form a government between Labour, the Liberals and D66
was scuttled by disagreement over future spending cuts.
The parties had reached broad consensus in other areas but still needed to
find additional spending cuts. Labour argued that savings should be found
within ministries while the Liberals insisted that greater economies should
be made in the country's social welfare system.
On Tuesday night, Mr Frits Bolkestein, Liberal leader, emerged from talks
with Mr Kok to say the Labour leader was prepared to take certain employees'
insurance schemes out of the public sector and leave them to employers. This
could be a concession to the Liberals' demands for radical changes in social
security.
At the same time, Mr Jacques Wallage, Mr Kok's deputy in the Labour party,
revealed that the expected shortfall in the social security budget over the
next four years could be only Fl 1.2bn (Pounds 444m) rather than the Fl 3bn
that was assumed last month. This could reduce the need to make sharp cuts
in social spending.
Mr Kok expects to reveal all to a politics-weary country next week. If his
solo efforts at forming a government fail, however, the search for a new
coalition could easily stretch into the autumn.

Mr Klaus Kinkel, Germany's foreign minister and leader of the Free Democrat
party, the junior partner in the governing coalition, yesterday warned FDP
party members that 'everything was at stake' in next October's federal
elections following a series of electoral defeats for the party. In a letter
to party members made public on Thursday, he urged them to ensure they do
not fall below the critical 5 per cent threshold necessary to win seats in
German legislatures. Mr Kinkel said 'the FDP is feeling the wind in its
face. But the liberals have also had to suffer setbacks in the past. We
overcame them by fighting. Complaining does not help.'

FT  22 JUL 94 / Economic Watch: French trade surplus continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France's external trading account continued to show a surplus during May of
FFr7.5bn (Pounds 900m), according to the latest statistics from French
customs. The May figure confirms the recent upward trend in the French
economy and brings France's total trading surplus to FFr30.6bn for the first
five months of 1994. This is in line with the government's forecasts for a
target surplus of FFr100bn for the whole year. The buoyant trading account
reflects a continuation of the strong export performance of French
companies. The level of exports rose to FFr107.4bn in May against FFr104bn
in April. However, import activity, which fell sharply last year when the
recession began, is now returning to normal levels. The value of imports
coming into France increased to FFr99.4m during May, its highest level since
November 1992.
Industrial production in the Netherlands rose 2.1 per cent in May from
April, on a seasonally adjusted basis, the government Central Bureau for
Statistics said yesterday. Seasonally adjusted industrial production was 2.6
per cent higher than in May 1993.
Italian consumer prices rose 0.2 per cent month on month and 3.5 per cent
year on year in July, according to unofficial data from nine leading Italian
cities excluding Rome, collated by the city of Bologna.

FT  22 JUL 94 / European Diary: EU debate simmers through summer - The issue
which is disturbing Sweden's near sacred holiday season
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is July and it has been unexpectedly and gloriously hot. There has been a
flurry of anxiety over the alarming state of the public finances, but not
much else to disturb a nation that customarily takes to the water and the
woods to make the best of an all-too-short summer.
Yet, even during the near-sacred July holiday, the Great Debate under way in
Sweden over whether to vote in a referendum in November to join the European
Union is never far away.
It is to be found high up in the Arctic circle, where the sun shines
brightly at midnight, but where temperatures are not so hot. (The last day
of the skiiing season at Riksgransen on the Norwegian border was June 26.)
And it is to be found as far south as you can get, in Skane, where the rich,
rolling farmland lies less than 20km across the Oresund from Denmark.
For Sweden, neutral throughout the century's great conflicts and once the
proud pursuer of a middle way between Soviet socialism and flat-out
capitalism, the decision whether to join the EU is a real watershed and is
widely perceived as such.
At the risk of evoking stereotypes, Swedes are engaging in a national debate
over the issue that is impressively earnest and far-reaching.
The referendum campaign has been somewhat confused by the campaign for the
general election, which comes first, in September. But if anything, this has
encouraged the two sides in the EU confrontation to get in extra campaigning
during the summer, before the election campaign takes centre-stage.
The Swedish Federation of Industries and the Swedish Employers' Federation
have, for example, joined forces to send out no fewer than 10 campaign buses
across the country from May to July to get their pro-EU message across. Not
to be outdone, the No to the EU campaign has chartered a boat to cruise
among the harbours, islands and lakes where so many Swedes retreat for the
holiday.
Early this month in the mining town of Kiruna, the country's most northerly
city, one of the industry buses (actually a custom-built 40ft lorry trailer)
pulled up for a couple of days in the main square. Equipped with a dizzying
array of at least 50 different books, leaflets and information sheets,
volunteers fanned out into the streets to look for converts in an area where
the No camp is firmly in the ascendant.
Even among those who declare they have made up their minds, the willingness
to come on to the trailer to discuss the issue is remarkable. On a sleepy
Sunday in Kiruna 167 people stopped to take up the debate.
Their concerns range from the mainstream worry that Sweden will lose its
independence by joining, through worries about the cost of membership to the
fear - apparently widespread - that thousands of German hunters and tourists
will trample the treasured Swedish countryside into mud.
'People are very open here, even though most of them are negative. They are
prepared to discuss the issues,' says Anne Flonneau, a Frenchwoman now
living in Sweden who is in charge of the Kiruna truck. As if to prove her
point, she launches into a lengthy argument with a local trade union leader
who is strongly anti-EU.
She does not change his mind, but says: 'What we don't want is people saying
'I don't know, so I'll vote No'. We want them to have the information.' The
cry 'I need more information' is heard everywhere. Yet Swedes probably now
have more information available to them explaining the issues than any Union
citizen. Every public library is packed with EU material, there are
government telephone hotlines and both sides in the debate are churning out
enough propaganda to strip Sweden of its forests.
Still, there is little sign of Euro-indigestion. In Skanor, a seaside resort
on the southern tip of Sweden, volunteers from another pro-EU industry bus
set up at a funfare. They canvassed holidaymakers rushing to the alcohol
monopoly to stock up on booze before it closed for the weekend. Nobody
seemed to mind being interrupted.
Mr Roger Gustafsson, a self-employed businessman on holiday in the town, is
inclined to vote No. But he eagerly took away a fistful of leaflets after a
chat with one of the canvassers. 'I am basically against the EU. We - you
and I - will have nothing to say, the politicians will decide everything,'
he declares.
But he adds: 'I could be persuaded to vote Yes - if I am sure Sweden will
still be able to decide the things that are important for Sweden. I need
more information. I've only just started to get the information.'
